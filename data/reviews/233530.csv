I don't usually get mad at games, but for this game I made an exception.\n\nIt's a Semi-roguelike escape platformer, except the only thing that really changes is where some flames and blocks spawn.\nIt does have some interesting modes and options to chose from though (like the ship sinking in LAVA).\n\nNow for the rage:\n\nThe menus load very slowly.\nYou can't skip some of the tutorial screens.\nYou CAN'T PAUSE EVER unless you get the radio which then RANDOMLY keeps popping up and pausing the game while you are trying to make tricky jumps.\nYou can't restart a failed run quickly (basically the fastest way is to Alt-F4 and restart the game).\nWhen you change screens you can sometimes get stuck going back and forth in a loop.\nWhile losing the power is a cool effect you cant see fire in the dark (WTF?).\nThe post processing effect lags the game a lot and makes it even harder to see what's going on.\nThe ship rocks side to side, which is fine, but there's also a weird jumping gravity mechanic that does weird things like make you no longer be able to air turn, or dead stop over fire/pits, so you have to be EXTREMELY careful all the time.\nYou literally jump higher if you run downhill first because of the way speed influences jump height.\nI'm not sure if it was related to the gravity/jump thing but sometimes I would just completely lose control midair as the ship rocked.\n\nImagine playing Mario brothers and then the lights go out while jumping and you stop in midair and fall straight down into dark fire and then you have this game.\n\nIf the weird jumping/gravity/air turn thing was fixed, and the unresponsive turning, and the dark fire, this would actually be a much more enjoyable game.","January 7, 2014","false","11.1"," 90 of 98 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","90","98","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heliosleinheart/recommended/233530/","heliosleinheart","Helios Leinheart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heliosleinheart/","640 products in account","I recommend this game under one stipulation. You buy it for a 1 hour experience and do not expect more than than that. Treat this game like "They Breathe". Not like an action platformer.\n\nThe sensation of being trapped at the bottom of a sinking ship. The utter seclusion and panic you feel as all is falling apart around you. These were real emotions that I felt during my first half hour playthrough of the game. Then I went in for a second time and wasn't nearly as impressed. The following is a list of problems that hurt the experience of this game.\n\n---\n\n1: Rising water should cause players to feel a sense of panic. Unfortunately, the water is almost no threat to you as you are given plenty of lung capacity AND you can find plentiful air bubbles. In fact, there were a few occasions where I actually waited for water to rise so a platforming section would be easier. So the main enemy of the game is a flop.\n\n2: I can't explain what's going on with this start screen menu. Sometimes it slows to a near hault and doesn't let you input anything, forcing you to reboot the game. (I did this three times in a row and the same thing happened). Sometimes if you let the animation in the background play for too long, the same thing will happen. I just don't get it...\n\n3: The start menu music is very good and conveys a sense of foreboding, but the music that plays during the game I find very repetitive and unappealing.\n\n4: The majority of the game seems to indicate that the devs were going for a serious experience. If this is true, then why are most of the radio transmissions trying to come off as humorous? Not to mention they keep coming up and stopping you in your tracks until you finish the message; Castlevania 2 style. This can be avoided by just not getting the radio, but with darkness covering the terrain most of the time, it's easy to pick it up by accident.\n\n5: I actually like that there is no pause button in the game. It helps to convey the urgency of steadily sinking to the bottom of the ocean. I would like to believe that the devs made that choice on purpose, until I discovered that the radio transmissions pause the game when they come up. *headdesk*\n\n6: This is more of a personal issue, but where does this game get off having so many trading cards to unlock? Not only does it take around 14 to craft a badge, but the 7 that the game gives you for purchasing it come at such a slow rate that you'd have to play the game for around 5 hours or more to get all of them. Sorry devs, but you are just way too big for your britches if you think people are going to play this game for that long.\n\n---\n\nLike I said, buy this on sale one day or in a bundle and enjoy the experience for an hour or so. Maybe you can find enough enjoyment to play for longer, but I found myself putting the controller down after 3 playthroughs. I don't regret playing the game, but I do regret that it isn't better. This could have been something truly memorable.","January 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

I was honestly shocked when I saw the top five reviews were all negative, stating points like bad graphics, bad controls, problems with the blur, crazy difficulty, jumping mechanic issues, and even a problem with a controller. I must be honest, I didn't find this game at all like this.\n\nLet me address the issue I have. For this, I'm going to go into my gameplay experience, which will of course contain certain spoilers as to how the game plays out - but let's be honest, if you've read the steam description of "Navigate through the ship however you want to find your way to the surface above, but avoid the ship's corrupted security system!" there's nothing to spoil. I played the game initially on the easy setting as I wanted to get used to the game mechanics before I committed myself to the harder difficulties. I must say that I found the rising water to make the game rather hectic, which of course is as the developers must have intended. You're escaping a sinking ship, you're not going to cuddle the nearest daffodil, you have to move, and it's going to be a bit crazy. On the way there were hazards such as blazing fire, exposed electrical wires, the security system of the ship had sent out turrets attached to the walls and ceilings of certain rooms, a challenging mix. If you're hit by any one of them too much, you black out, and wake up with the rushing water at your feet. Your objective is the 3 holes in the top of the boat, that being the two big funnels, and one near the centre of the deck.\n\nThis, I must be honest, is a fantastic scenario. It's executed well for a 2d game. My complaints? Not much. It took half an hour to clear on easy, after which I moved to Medium and found that some more hazards and such were made available to navigate around. Either that, or I was just lucky enough to not run into them on easy mode. After attempting hard, I must say, this is were it actually got difficult. Resources were scarce, puzzles were abundant and the rising water was quicker than in the other two difficulties. It was indeed a hectic experience. The difficulty is definitely within its bounds, contrary to what most other reviews seem to suggest. Furthermore I didn't have any trouble with the blur, but that's able to be turned off anyway in the settings under the label Post-Processing. My controller worked perfectly, it's a standard USB XBox 360 controller, nothing too extravagant, nothing insane or problematic. Is it an optimal gamepad for everything on steam? I think so - Borderlands 2 works fantastically with it for example.\n\nJumping mechanics were also complained about in other reviews. This will take some explaining. You're on a sinking boat, bobbing and rocking as it slowly descends into the ocean. As it rocks, your movement will act accordingly. Think for a moment. You're running up a hill and jump... Not much air time, right? You fall onto the higher ground quite quickly. Now run down the hill, and jump again. Your jump lasts a lot longer. You jump further, you land later. It's common sense. So there's a big gap between you and the door... but you just can't make the jump, the platform is slightly higher than yours because of the ship's current rotation... So you wait for the ship to rock to the other side so that platform is lower, and jump again. Congratulations, jump complete. It's physics. And it's well executed in my opinion.\n\nOne other complaint was with the graphics - do you not look at the screenshots on this page? This is what you're getting! This is a preview of what you'll be playing if you buy this game! Come on people, this is basic stuff, steam is doing you a favour here, at least look at what you're being offered! There MUST be something wrong here. I personally find these screenshots a good representation of how the game looks during play, so I completely regard this as a null and pointless complaint.\n\nThere is one final thing I saw in the complaints though. There is no pause function. I personally view this as a 50/50 thing. Yes, it would be nice to pause the game. However, I think that being able to pause, walk away and come back later goes against the developer's intention of a hectic game where you're meant to be frantically trying to reach the surface. Think about the scenario for a moment. You wake up on the bottom of a sinking ship, the water's rising, you have to escape, you open a locked door, find an axe, break through a wooden door, then it hits you! OH MAN, GOTTA FEED MY TAMAGOTCHI PET.\n\nI'm going to put this simply. If you can't be committed to play this for half an hour straight, you likely won't beat this game, even on easy. It's not huge by any means, but it lasts longer than your typical game of tetris. If you're looking for a game you can beat in 5 minutes, this is not the game for you, and I highly doubt you'll find anything like that on steam. You're on a page for a game that will last about half an hour on the easiest setting for one playthrough, and if you're an achievement seeker, you got plenty more playtime ahead of you in total. This is not pong, or snake, or angry birds, it will take a while. Granted, I see the issue, sometimes something unforseen happens. A guy knocks at your door, the cat knocks over your neatly arranged collection of "The Chronicles of Narnia" books into the fish bowl, or the baby begins throwing his food around and crying because he doesn't understand the meaning of waste, and you gotta put down your controller, sort that out and come back. Yes, a pause function would indeed be handy to have, and maybe they should have a setting at least to enable / disable pausing. Although I halfheartedly want them to throw in a steam achievement labelled "I wanted to hug a daffodil" for using it.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nDEFINITELY. If you're a regular gamer with some free time and enjoy this kind of thing, go for it.\n\nWhat would I rate it?\n8/10, it's a brilliant game, but not everyone has half an hour straight to play a game.","June 28, 2014","true","3.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonAbomination/recommended/233530/","NeonAbomination","NeonAbomination","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonAbomination/","1116 products in account","Wake. What can I say about Wake. Well, I suppose I'll start with this. Wake is a game about getting off a ship that is filling up with water, and it's terrible. It's terrible in most aspects. For most people, Wake is a piece of crap that they will load up once, play for maybe a few minutes, and then quit. Yet, I like this game, and I find it funny that the majority of negative reviews here have drastically more play time than me. I don't see why so many people here would play a game for 3 or 5 hours if they hated it as much as it seems they do, but who am I to judge? I've beaten this game. Only once, but once is enough I feel. So, what do I think about Wake?\n\nWell, first off, the visuals. By god, the visuals. You see those screenshots up there on the store page? You see how they look like someone was taking snapshots of the gameplay with a cheap camera? Yeah, that's what the game actually looks like in gameplay. I know it may be hard to understand exactly how they managed to make it look the way it does, but it does. I'm actually rather impressed to be honest. The game is so blurry and so dark, it's hard to imagine the creative process behind deciding to make it look like that, and it WAS a conscious decision. These developers have made games that don't have this effect, so it must have been a choice here.\n\nNow, some may think that I think the visuals look incredibly bad from these comments, but in honesty, I don't! I actually feel this makes the game rather immersive. It's strange, but these visuals in motion, along with how the rest of the game feels, are actually rather neat in their own way. It's almost like a dream, a lucid dream I suppose. It really does add a sense of fear to the game, and a sense that, in a way, this isn't a game.\n\nThis feeling is helped drastically by the music. The music is the one thing in this game that I don't think anyone could describe as being broken. It works just fine, and actually adapts to the way you move through the environment. If you're in water, the music slows down, and as soon as you resurface, it speeds up rapidly again. It adds a great sense of tension, especially when you're lost and don't know where to go.\n\nBeing lost is a large factor in this game, and the game is randomized every time. You do have a map, but it's not much help, seeing as many rooms have different ways to exit them and climb higher, be it a locked door you need a key or an axe for, or maybe a ventilation shaft that needs the room to already be filled with water for you to get up it.\n\nThe controls in this game are... well, it feels a little like your controlling a car instead of a human being. There's a lot of sliding around, and you still move sort of slowly despite this. The ship you are on is also constantly shifting from left to right, which impacts how far you can jump in one direction or how fast you'll run. A bit of a confusing feature, but an interesting one at least. I sort of like it, it brings an element into the game that needs some form of attention you don't usually find elsewhere.\n\nWake is a charming game, but charming in the same way as a kind, nervous mother who wants to take care of you, but messes up everything she does and ends up feeling like a failure because of it, while you feel sorry for her and assure her that it's alright. That's Wake, and I love it.\n\nWant to keep updated on games I recommend? I'm a curator!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/233530/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nWake is the type of game that seems promising at first and keeps you entertained for a while, but fails to deliver once you got the idea behind its concept. That concept is as simple as it can get: you are on a ship that is slowly sinking and the only way to escape is by climbing all the way up to the top where the three exists are located, avoiding fire, debris and for some reason automated machine guns that will be shooting at you on your way up. Besides that, little is known about your character, what sunk the ship or why are you the only one inside it and even though the game doesn't give you any direction or indications, your purpose is pretty obvious, but on your way to the exit, you might encounter some difficulties. As you make your way up to the top the only thing you know is that you must head upwards and to help with that you have a map of the entire ship meant to display all the chambers, notifying you of the one you are currently in and giving you a sense of direction to where you should head next depending on where the hallways from one chamber to the next one are located; however inside the actual game that isn't executed as smoothly as it sounds, as most of the doors leading to those hallways are locked and the only way to unlock them is by using one of the keys you collected to unlock the terminal which will most likely be placed at the other end of the chamber, so until you memorize the layout of those chambers, which differs each time you restart the game, but not in a definitive way, you'll have to needlessly move from one end of the chamber to the other and repeat. There is no actual story to follow as the game takes an arcade style, focusing more on replayability, but for a game that centers around that the radio transmitter messages that will randomly pop up as you make your way up top, they are a futility as they only state obvious things such as the alarming amount of water around you and there is no way to disable them either, so you will have to skip those each time you replay the game.\nRating: 4\n\nGameplay\nYour most useful tool, at least until you familiarize yourself with the ship is your map, as you will constantly use it to orientate yourself and find the easiest way up top, but at the same time it can become your worst nightmare as the doors or terminals aren't marked, so making your way to where the hallway of a chamber appears on the map will send you back to where you came from most of the times simply because there is a locked door between you and that hallway. Aside from that, your most useful items will be the axe which can be used to smash wooden doors, opening up new routes out of a chamber and the keys which are used to unlock terminals for electronic doors. There are three levels of difficulty, but that isn't where the challenge is supposed to be, as even the most inexperienced player can finish the game on hard as by default if you die, instead of having to restart the game the water level will simply rise all the way to your location, but even if it does get above your level your character can swim just fine, so as long as you have the patience to find a way out, you shouldn't have any problem escaping. The real challenge comes in the form of achievements, as they will put different conditions in which you have to escape, such as avoiding water entirely or escaping without collecting any keys. Those challenges might keep the hardcore achievement hunters around for a while longer, but even if they manage to do that, the game is still a half frustrating, half boring experience. No matter how many times you change the condition under which you have to escape, the way up there is always the same: avoiding machine guns and fire, struggling to jump from one block to another because the jump mechanic only works when it wants to and finally escaping through one of the three exits just to see the same ending. On top of that the game has a large number of technical issues, starting with the menu that takes way too much time to load, random crashes or the classic character stuck in the environment cases.\nRating: 4.5\n\nGraphics\nJust like Lunnye Devitsy, Boss Baddie's other game included in The Lunar Pack, Wake also launches at a fixed resolution and apart from choosing between fullscreen, small windowed mode or large windowed mode, there is no way to change that. Once again, playing in fullscreen becomes an issue on bigger displays. The effects range from horrible to even more horrible as they often disturb the eye more than they please and apart from telling you where the fire is or in which part a machine gun is shooting they really are useless to the overall design. The ship might not be the largest map and it doesn't need to be considering its purpose, but for a ship that has over 15 different chambers, it's shocking to see that the only thing helping you differentiate one from another is the wall colour in the background.\nRating: 3.5\n\nAudio\nWake sounds just as bad as it looks, with effects for basic things such as jumping or pushing objects around sounding mediocre and in the heat of the running, feeling even absent. Machine guns shots sound just as bad, with obvious tonality issues and the water sound effects that are just not there. Even worse, this game features possibly one of the worst soundtracks in the gaming history, with the same annoying song playing in the background over and over again, and no way to turn it off, but I guess since the effects are just as useless you could just play the entire game on mute.\nRating: 1.5\n\nExtras\nGetting to one of the three exits shouldn't take longer than 5-10 minutes, but considering you have to familiarize yourself with the map first, your first playthrough will probably take around 30. Once you get that over with, it really depends on how many achievements you're aiming for, since that's your only motivation to replay the game on different scenarios, but even so earning each one of them shouldn't take longer than 4-5 hours.\nRating: 3\n\nVerdict\nWake is an arcade game, even though it is not aware of that, trying to force obvious story bits on you, but it is a very bad arcade game, since it is boring more than challenging, and frustrating more than enjoyable, making it a bygone in your library of games once you got the idea and got bored of hunting for the remaining achievements.\nRating Overall: 3.3\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Wake at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=245[/h1]","May 3, 2014","false","5.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Let me repeat: Pausing - a feature near-standard in single-player videogames since, I dunno, a bit after Pitfall - is not implemented. Let me repeat once more, this time using caps-lock, for super-emphasis: YOU CANNOT PAUSE THE GAME!!),\n-- Simply godawful play mechanics (random radio "cutscenes" pop up at odd moments, explaining the stupid backstory nobody in their right minds gives a sh­it about - this also doubles as a "pause" function of sorts)\n\nand of course, to top it all off,\n\n-- Utterly putrid play mechanics (have I mentioned the wonky swimming controls? I really hope I haven't, because I'm sorta running low here and really don't feel like starting the game up again to find something else I don't like about it).\n\nI ripped the other game in the "Lunar Pack" (Lunnye Devitsy) for being a pretentious, uninspired exercise in pointlessness, but compared to this game, Lunnye Devitsy is an absolute masterful fusion of gameplay and art.","January 9, 2014","false","1.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

My worst experience on Steam so far.  Which is, like my other bad review for Ace Patrol, less about the gameplay and more about the state of the game.\n\nThe game is simply erratic.  The first time I loaded up, I couldn't access the menu at all, because it wasn't there.  The only button that worked was ESC, only if I held it down for several seconds.  Loaded again, I got a menu but couldn't use it.  Closed and plugged in my game pad.  Now the game took minutes to get to the screen, and still barely worked.  I was able to get to config, but couldn't get anything to work, pressed "B" and it took me back to the menu.  And it was suddenly working.  That time.\n\nThe game runs at low res with a lot of post-processing.  There is an option to disable post-processing, and I recommend it.  The game actually looks awful with it.  All of the details in the graphics are obscured by it.  But it does not actually fix the real problem.  There is a massive blurring effect that not only effects the game's graphics, but all of the text and visuals as well.  All in-game text, including the menus are blurred and much of it is illegible.\n\nShould you actually manage to get into the game, you'll find that the controls are erratic and don't always do what they are supposed to do.  For instance, there is a crucial climb ability, but it only works some of the time, even when done the same way each time.  Or in the same climb.\n\nAnd to make it all worse, running the game full screen actually runs at a low res with the Steam overlay.  Any messages that popup will not appear off in the corner.  No, they will take up the entire bottom half of the screen almost.\n\nIf there is a good game buried in here, I will have a hard time finding it.  I hear there is manual tweak to remove the graphics effects, and I will look into that.  In its current state, this game is unplayable.","June 22, 2014","false","2.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Wake certainly has a good one, placing you in the soggy workboots of an engineer on a sinking ship. Starting in the bowels of the hull, you must find your way topside before the ship fills with water. Along the way you'll find keys to open doors, fire axes to bash down less sturdy doors, flashlights and flares, and bits of meteor that apparently started this whole mess. Another survivor pesters you over the radio, but I have no idea what his deal is and he doesn't really add anything to the game.\n\nIt's a good concept to be sure, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The rooms of the ship are huge and sprawling, with extremely contrived platforming challenges to overcome like floating platforms and crate mazes. There are tons of dead-ends, which wouldn't be so bad if the map were clearer or if they didn't come at the end of an arduous hallway spanning half the ship. You're also bound to reach jumps you can't make, even with the touchy climbing controls, which leaves you waiting for the water level to rise so you can swim up through the passage. The water rises at a glacial pace, though, so I actually resorted to killing myself which catches the water level up to you instantly.\n\nWake really fails the first measure of a good platformer, having reliable control over your character. You sprint at inconsistent speeds, you sometimes have air control and sometimes don't, and some jumps can be rendered impossible by the angles the ship lists at. Add some over-processed, blurry pixel graphics and a mysterious story that's never resolved (or is resolved at higher difficulties, which you won't play) and you have a real mess on your hands. I love the idea of escaping a sinking ship via skillful platforming, but I guess I'll have to keep waiting for someone to do it well.","February 15","false","3.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I first saw this game and looked past it's blurry and almost random graphics because it actually seemed like a fair game with a great plot. I was quickly disappointed. After spending about 15 minutes trying to get things working and less burry (Which turning off post processing did nothing and the 640x360 resolution option yielded a larger window than the 1280x720 option.) I started the game on easy.\n\nThe controls took some getting used to, but were fine after a bit, so that wasn’t a big deal. Finding the radio (On accident, because you aren’t told it even exists) however, is the only pause feature you get. To make things so much better, it’s random. Need to focus on a jump? Cross your fingers that your annoying “friend” doesn’t go off. Need to use the restroom? Cross your legs and pray your electronic wilson talks to you soon. I do understand though why you’re not able to pause. Your virtual companion is knee deep in ocean water and his own panicky tears. You getting a break really takes away from the fairness. But I guess I can kinda look past all that (Maybe).\n\nI kept playing because I hoped maybe there’d be a silver lining to all this. All I found was a lining made out of used dental floss and wasted time. The electrical hazard only harms you when ran into under water (It makes sense but it’s kinda hard to accidentally run into an obvious no-no) and the fire hazard well… Just hope the lights don’t go out, because for some reason you can’t see it in the dark. But the lasers weren’t a downer thankfully, as long as you didn’t think about why a boat would have lasers in the first place. But I digress.\n\nThis game could have been at least a 7/10, but ended with a 2/10 in my complete opinion. I really wish this game could have been better because it could have been a good one. I’m glad that I only paid $1.24 for this, even though it was wasted. Don’t buy this game and get something else.

So you change to window mode again (1280x960 is higher resolution available... is this really a 2014 game?) and... well things still are f**ked up.\nEventually you manage to start the game and you realize two things: the first, Wake is the averagest average platformer in the history of average indie platformer; the second is that you're getting blind because of the atrocious in-game blur effect.

Aside from briefly showing the controls and what items to pick up/avoid, nothing is explained nor any goal given. Dropped into a sinking ship with the water quickly rising around you, escape becomes the logical objective, but even knowing this Wake seems to go out of its way to annoy, confuse, and simply bore the player through the entire 20-minutes it takes to complete.\n\nFrom the uncomprehending scoring system, to the multiple difficulties (which can only be raised after clearing the previous level), the developer sabotages what it obviously intended to increase replay value: shooting for better hi-scores on the leaderboards. Even had it been explained what and why you received points for different actions, playing through the game the first time was such an dull and arduous experience that I couldn't force myself to go through it again.\n\nThe controls are slow and unrefined (especially for climbing, something you do a lot), passages often lead to dead ends with no way to progress but wait for the water to eventually rise and ironically carry you up to safety, and it looks and runs like complete rubbish. Upscaled from 640x360 on a modern display, it results in an unbearably distorted image which still managed to slow to a crawling 2-3 frames-per-second during the final (and most visually undemanding) scene.\n\nI yearn for the day Boss Baddie releases a game that surprises what I've come to expect from them, but Wake is not that game. It tries to emulate the experimental, ambiguous nature of game like Limbo but jumps the shark and assumes not giving an answer for why anything is happening or a reason for it to, as being the same as letting players come to their own conclusions.\n\nThe only thing I managed to infer almost immediately was that this is neither worth your money or time, both of which will be better spent on almost anything else.","January 2, 2014","false","2.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

After plugging in my spare controller, the menu was easy enough to navigate, despite having a 10 second transition between menus. The game is very simple. You are on a sinking ship, sinking because it has been struck by meteors… or asteroids… you’re not quite sure.  You have to make your way upwards to escape… I think. Nothing is really explained asides from the controls and things you can collect.\n\nThere was an axe at some point, though it looked more like a ♥♥♥♥♥ with red balls. While I don’t mind pixel graphics, I think in a world of digital artists, graphic designers and modern technology, games should have so much more. That being said, if a game is going to use pixelated, 1990′s graphics, then it better be a good game, otherwise it comes off as pretentious and… well, crap.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/01/04/brief-write-of-a-brief-flight-wake/","January 4, 2014","false","3.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Sounds fun, right! Yes it does! But you must be thinking of another game, because this game is not fun and it's not really randomized. The "areas" are randomized in some way, but the ship always has the same layout.\n\nMaybe you weren't expecting greatness. Maybe you can overlook a "rogue-like" where it actually pays to die and respawn with the ship further under water so you can swim past the poorly designed platforming elements with ease. Maybe you just wanted a silly little game for your laptop to game-on-the-go. If that's you, well, once again you're thinking of another game. Wake is so poorly optimized your laptop will think it's running BF3 on ultra high settings in high res. Even the install process takes longer than games that exponentially dwarf the space Wake takes up on a HDD (45mins on a new laptop, 15-20mins on PC).\n\nThere are so many other cheap indie games worth your money.

I'm usually not a stickler for "Style Choices" but this game is on of the few exceptions where I feel like the style is more of a detriment to the game.\n\nYou can have you game look like garbage and still play good but when the aesthetics interfere with how I am able to play with the game there is a problem. Having environment block my view AND have a filter that looks like someone decided to wipe their sweaty ♥♥♥♥ is a large problem. I could live with it except for the fact that I can't see the game that I am playing about a quarter of the time.\n\nThere is also proper resolution support and disabling the one filter in the game that makes it blurrier is a must.\n\nThe game is very basic and not really worth more than 50 cents, hell I can find better games on Newgrounds for free. If you want a quick game that doesn't really have any replay value you can buy this game, but I would advise against it.","November 7, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you traverse the various rooms and decks looking for a way out, more and more parts of the ship become impossibe or harder to visit thanks to the water constantly climbing.\n\nThere are also lot of hidden routes and rooms to discover, although it has to be said that Wake is very light on actual highlights. It could have used more interesting locales or eastereggs. Even a room you are asked to find in order to unlock a certain achievement turns out to be little else than a standard locale.\n\nAlso, don't expect too much from the advertised random set-up of the sinking ship as the general layout stay the same on every playthrough. Only select objects are placed randomly opening up or blocking certain passages. It makes for more variety but not as much as one could expect upfront.\n\nSince Wake comes in an inexpensive  bundle with the superior Lunnye Devitsy it's a solid recommendation.","May 15","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
