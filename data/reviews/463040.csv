"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazedlion/recommended/463040/","krazedlion","Krazedlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazedlion/","2046 products in account","Experience is a platform/puzzle game with some nice music. The menu is in Russian with the option to change to English, after figuring out which one is the option for language. Once you change the language and go back to the main screen...well damn, its back in Russian again! I don't read Russian and the games description reads  "the main character aimlessly wanders through various locations destroying everything", well thats about all you can do if you can't read the text and theres no story! There is no sense of direction, no objectives, no map and no idea what, where or why I even started playing this so-called game. To make a good platforming game one of the most important elements is the controls. The controls are floaty and terrible and the weapons are pathetic and inaccurate.  Each level is muddled and has annoying fake difficulty because of the crappy controls. You're physically unable to collect all of the loot that you recieve when killing enemies. The asinine game design requires you to die multiple times just to figure out some of the puzzles. Its not at all fun and should be avoided! Experience is a horrible Experience...FYI this was in a  bundle and I did not upvote it while it was in Greenlight!","May 22","false","9.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You can't even change the language setting and have it save. Everytime I switched it and left the menu it switched it back. I have no idea what the win condition of each level is, you physically cannot collect all of the money that you earn from killing enemies, and the game design requires you to die multiple times just to figure out some of the puzzles. Terrible game and I would not recommend this game.\nSave your $2 and buy an ice cream or something.","May 13","false","0.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

Take the loose soupy controls of the character and combine that with painfully inaccurate weapons cause 'Experience' to be a bad one.","May 17","false","1.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Just...Kill 25 things in this level, upgrade your guns.\nWould like to see a little something extra to actually make this game GOOD.\nAs it is, it is worth a few hours of your time maybe.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/T5AvysRV-p8","May 2","true","0.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"
