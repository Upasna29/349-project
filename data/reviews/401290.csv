But, it just wasn't doing it for me.\n\nThe concept, visual art and music in this game is fine and dandy, but the English is broken (or just the way it is phrased, seems off or weird to a native speaker) and just breaks the immersion for me.\nA big part in gaming for me is the plot, storyline, and character development. So if I am unable to gauge how the character is even feeling from what is being said, then that's a problem.\n\nIt's probably just me though. I'm sure fans from other parts of the world who aren't particular about grammar will enjoy this.","November 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","41","61","3","6"

It's a JRPG with adventure and romance sim aspects, and it reminds me a lot of a more fleshed out the park portions of the Pokémon games. Great artwork, good characters and most importantly a big mysterious island to explore for its secrets!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8qiQUua2iE","November 20, 2015","true","2.5"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","32","46","3","0"

After several hour of wandering and starving (I never feed the MC) I use the loot I get to fulfill the quest and get some money.\n\nWith lot of money on my hand I buy the best equipment I can get (the Gun is awesome) and finally started to grind my level. It was weird way to play but Nusakana give me freedom to do this and I like it.\n\n\nPro =\n\nThis game gave you certain degree of a freedom.\n\nThere are many pretty girl to recruit, and each of them is have distinct personality and main skill, I like several of them especially Orca (dat White sukumizu and eyepatch combination is awesome).\n\nThere plenty thing to do in this game from fishing, crafting, or just wandering around while searching for an event, when I think there no more thing to do an event or sidequest is pop up.\n\nAbout the grammar, I actually not really bothered by it since my english not so good to became grammar Nazi, one thing I realized that is only the native nusakana people who speak broken english, I think the developer is make them speak broken English on purpose that it's actually funny because in my country some of the native do speak like that.\n\nI like the humor, there some plenty oblivous referense like Brometheus line "do you even lift"\n\nCustom Resources, almost all of the resources on Nusakana is original except of animation and SE\n\nThe dev put lot effort on battler, they actually moved depending on the action (Need more fluid boob bouncing animation though.)\n\nNice music.\n\nCons =\n\n- Vast area? Sometime I lost, although I able to memorize it after few hour.\n- There some lag at certain area, like sea fishing spot.\n- Sometime it hard to escape from battle, fortunately if you died you will sent directly to the inn.","November 26, 2015","true","9.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/401290/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Nusakana is a prime example of the perfect utilization of RPGMaker. Although it’s definitely not your atypical RPG it’s a refreshing take on the genre that offers a lot to those who give it an opportunity.  The game incorporates the traditional components of a JRPG in RPGMaker style but it also features critical components of an adventure and romance game as well. Some have already compared it to Pokemon meets Harvest Moon and in many ways I would have to agree that that is probably the best way to describe the game. I thought that Studio Namaapa really worked hard to make a cohesive art and audio style befitting of the game. My favorite aspect of the game was the level of freedom that it offers. Too many RPGMaker games feel locked in – the game designer expects you to do certain things in a certain order and don’t offer much leeway. Instead, Nusakana allows you to explore, adventure and hunt at your leisure. Thankfully the world is of a significant size giving you a lot of areas to explore.\n\nIf there were flaws in the game it’s that the English translation isn’t the highest quality. Those of you playing from countries where English is a second language will not have an issue playing but it could have been worked on and perfected a lot more than what it is. It’s also arguable that although the developers did a great job in creating an open world in a RPGMaker game that perhaps a better level of concentration in developing the story would have been wise. Don’t get me wrong I enjoyed the open nature of the game immensely but it felt that the main story was missing a lot of what was perhaps initially intended.\n\nIn all, I understand the negative reviews on Steam although I myself would place myself into the significantly higher percentage of people who enjoyed the game. Nusakana can be recommended for those who enjoy rock solid RPGMaker games and JRPGs. There’s more than enough content in the game to be discovered for it to be a good purchase.","January 8","true","4.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

I felt there was no plot, no general storyline, only odd side-quests. And while roaming around talking to everyone, might be fun for some, it gives you no reward. Some areas of improvement are graphics, the text-bars could even be on a transparent color, (Blue signifies a win95 color scheme, we are in the 21st century), and battle balancing. Also you should be able to switch characters mid-battle or use items without costing a turn. Starting out in the game and I realise the reason for forcing the player to the inn, instead of allowing them to walk there; but you have side-quests that are deceptive because you obviously cant beat them because you die in two hits.\nYou should always ask a second opinion before you present some thing to the public, especially if you are asking for support. If it had gone to early access I feel like they could have asked the community for ideas and suggestions, we can always improve oursleves. They have a tough road ahead of themselves, most gamers get that, with going up against the big dogs that have done it better and been around longer.\nI will say I do like the humour and I do like the pixel art. They did a good job with the music track/sound, although as others have said the grammar is off, although I dont mind that as long as I have a reason to play. But you need to show more heart and originality because currently it is lacking badly. As I say if they had brought it to early access you could have asked the community for support but as a fully released game, it needs to be fully done. And while it might be in one persons eyes, it isnt worth the price point.\nHow many times do we say it. You cant just put items in a game and expect that alone to add to the games core content. You need to stand out and bring some thing NEW to the table.","November 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","22","40","0","0"

The Open World game with refresh theme. (Remind me Digimon World)\n-> This is not about the chosen one or over powered hero who beat the god !, you just ordinary human who want to trip in Nusakana.\n-> Dating sims, i love how meet Orca <3. She's my waifu !\n-> I love the setting in this game, you can re-mapping your controller by yourself.\n\nCons :\n-> You must exploring by yourself to find the clue. (It's ok for me, but dunno with other players).\n\nOverall :\nThis game have interesting content and world, if you love Harvest Moon or Digimon World 1,  you must play this game !\nNusakana theme too love able for me and unforgettable, i like the idea to make various version of Nusakana theme.\n\nYou can learn about Indonesian too, such as the food, drink and more !\nI will play this game until finish !\nBecause Orca waiting for me <3\n\nI don't know why some people give a negative review but they are just playing one hours.\nYou must try to explore Nusakana World, to reveal all features.\nYou must unlock the features by yourself, just like play Harvest Moon or DMW1.\n","November 26, 2015","true","13.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Well this game has some flaws in it but most of them you can overlook them.\n\nPro\n- Great Concept\nI really love this game concept. It's wide open. You can do whatever you want. From Fishing , Crafting , Fight some monster there is a lot of things to do in this game. But the problem lie itself in this game concept which I'll talk about that later in this review.\n\n- BGM & Art\nBGM in this game is really relaxing. Actually some of track in this game remind me of The Sims 1 and I really love The Sims 1 tracks.\n\nI really love the art of this game. Look good to me\n\nCon\n- "Where the f*ck do I go"\nYes it really wide open and most of the time you don't know where you should go and what you should do. It's really confusing me. Because this game has no "main plot" (or it has but I just play for around hour so I don't know). So most of the time you'll just run around and don't know what to do next.\n\n- Learning Curve\nI don't know that this is because I'm bad at this game or this game really hard. At the first area I'm fine , I can take care of Monitor Lizard , Chicken but in the next area of this game. You'll face wolf and that wolf kill me in one hit. So I think maybe should I get some better equiqment but the "better" equiqment cost me a lot. So where do you get money? by doing quest and there is a lot of quest that impossible for you when you just start playing this game.\n\n- No Exp bar\nI look every where and I can't see any not only exp bar but "Level Indicator". So I don't know I ready to face some tougher enemy or not and I don't want to risk facing tougher monster and get wreck.\n\n- Resolution\nEven "Fit" in option still look bad for me. There is only three options. x1 which is really small , x2 which is ehh...still small and Fit which is look bad for my monitor.\n\nOverall even it has some flaws this game is enjoyable. not the best RPG Game I ever play but at least you can kill some time in this game.","November 23, 2015","true","26.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

No restraints!\n- Nice Music, changes according to the day-night cycle.\n- A good looking battle system.\n- Indonesian languange, culture and food! Also, mangosteen pills.\n- Nice looking art style.\n- It's always a satisfying feeling when you figure out/ discover how to complete a quest.\n\nCons:\n- There is no indication when the cycle is about to change. That can be annoying sometimes.\n-  Some foreigners may not understand the Indonesian lingo.\n\nOverall, I think it's an okay game. I'll definitely try to finish this game when I have the time.\nRegardless, I think it's pretty amazing that a two-man team can finish this game.
