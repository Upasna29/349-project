I've been following this game since I was in community college several years ago. I found the game because it was a WIP being created in the Blender Game Engine - something I was learning to use at the time. The developer's accomplishments even then absolutely astounded me, and I became dedicated to following his every update.\n\nReading some of the negative reviews, I feel like people are expecting this game to be something that it isn't. This game was never going to have the quality of a game created by a team of vastly experienced developers. This was created by one man using his own knowledge and experience to work with a rather complex and somewhat limited open source engine to create a game.\n\nIn my opinion, this game will best be enjoyed by those that are interested in using open source tools like Blender to create a video game. It shows what's possible - what you can do. There aren't a lot of projects out there like it, and those projects that do exist are rarely completed by their developers (one game, Elpis, is another that I followed around the same time that I started following Krum. It looked great at the time, but development eventually died off). Seeing the developer of Krum never give up despite the challenges he faced in development was encouraging and inspiring.\n\nSeeing Krum appear in the Steam Library at last - and receiving the email with my CD-Key - was like a dream come true. Years and years of watching development, stalking a YouTube channel, and hoping that I wouldn't see the update stating that he'd cancelled the project had finally paid off. I downloaded the game and started playing, and I've not been disappointed. The game is excellently created considering it was completed by one man using an open source game engine. Not only that, but the game is still being developed and updated!\n\nSo, in conclusion:\nIf you set your expectations in the right place, you won't be disappointed by this game. Expect this game to be what it is: a personal project created by one developer with limited experience, using all of his own assets and skills to create something with an open source game engine. Don't expect a project that will be on-par with the Game of the Year created by a large team of developers. This game is excellent for what it is, and I'm proud to have followed it all these years.","December 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 78 of 110 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","78","110","3","8"

I've played about seven hours so far, and have enjoyed most of them. It doesn't offer massive RPG depth, but has cool environments that swap out just about the time when you start wanting some new scenery. It offers some combination-based combat, but I don't find myself really using it, and the controls are a little wonky and would benefit from less vertical clamping, which feels very limited at times. I would also much rather see a standard shift key run option than the current double tap [W] key. Overall, it's a pretty simple hack and slash wih tons of cool artwork, that kept me entertained for hours. It should also be noted that it's a wildly impressive showing of what a single developer can do with the Blender Game Engine.","January 30","true","8.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

However, there are a lot of bugs and glitches that I found while playing the game: ragdolls getting stuck in the floor or ceiling, missing ground in which you fall to your death, no skybox at the bottom of pits... Also, most of the enemies that you face all look and fight the same, adding to the overall biggest flaw of the game: its repetitiveness.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game tries to be like one of those old-school action games that I grew up with (Rune, Gothic and Drakan being a few examples), and at the beginning I was having a blast. But after 30 minutes, and having killed the 8th enemy in the game, I understood what I got into. The game suffers from repetitiveness: while you do have combos for your weapons, most of the time you will just keep mashing the attack button to kill your enemies. You also have long-ranged weapons, but they are really useless and deal much less damage than axes or swords.\nEvery enemy drops some items and its weapon, giving you the possibility to change your weapons (that keep degrading). Unfortunately, they all feel the same, making the use of one over the other pointless. Exploring the environments also feels lifeless, and choosing to go straight to your objective rather than engaging in fights feels more satisfying than it should be.\n\nCHALLENGEThe only challenge lies in the combat. You will encounter two types of AI: one first parries, then attacks, then parries, then attacks... and the other just keeps attacking till it runs out of stamina. Both of those can be easily defeated if you understand who you are fighting. Otherwise, once you get hit by the latter AI, you are doomed to die since just a couple of hits will kill you, especially in the beginning of the game. Most of the time I found myself more frustrated than challenged, and that's not all that fun.\n\nSOUNDThe voice acting is just as cheesy as I wanted it to be. However, the voice of our hero often feels computer-generated, often making certain situations very funny.\nThe soundtrack is fine, with some good tracks here and there. Often enough, the "no-enemy-around" music kept playing while the "fight" music activated while heading into battle, forcing me to completely remove the music from the game, to hear the competent but often cheap sound effects.\n\nREPLAYABILITYAs far as I know, there is almost no replayability at all: no Steam or in-game achievements, difficulty settings, secrets or new game modes don't make me want to come back to this game.\n\nOverall, I do appreciate that this game was made by only one person. But still, the repetitive combat, game-breaking glitches and frustration make this feel more like a chore than an epic fantasy. If you are really interested, pick it up on sale.\n\nStory: 4\nGraphics: 6\nGameplay: 5\nChallenge: 4\nSound: 5.5\nReplayability: 4\n\nENJOYMENT: 5\nFRUSTRATION: 8\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","November 25, 2015","false","5.3"," 44 of 85 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","44","85","4","0"

Sure it is a little rough around the edges, has somewhat clunky controls, but it looks okay and is kinda fun. My pc (3,4 ghz quad core, gtx 960, 8 gb ram) can't run it on ultra which I find surprising, but that and the controls are only a minor problem for me.","April 22","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was very exicted to here about it's release. Was I dissapointed? No I was not. I started the game to good music and a nicly put together menu. I was getting kind of giddy when I pushed play. not much to say about the intro since it was quite short. Then the game started, Heres what I have to say about it:\n\nPRO'S: Amazing landscape and level design, the world looks amazing! It's also interesting and different.\nAs for the gamplay, its really quite good, nothing really sloppy or annoying. Aslo the animations are well done.\nCombat was fun, also challenging. Its actually pretty tricky when fighting stronger enemies, while most enemies are pretty easy to defeat, all it takes is a good combo from one of there axes to take out most of your health. Music, Very good, adds allot to the rugged world  Krum is set in.\n\nCONS: Bugs obviously, Now most of the bugs can be overlooked I think, the only one that botheres me is the camera gltich. It happenes randomly and can be very annoying if it pops up in the middle of a fight. It seems to cause you camera to stick so you cant move it up or down, only side to side. Other then that . . . .\n\nVERDICT: Krum is a well put together Action RPG with beutiful design, music, and a solid fighting system that doesnt get old. of course theres some bugs, but there not bad and can be overlooked.  on a scale of 1/10  I give krum an  "8/10."","November 24, 2015","true","7.6"," 15 of 43 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","15","43","0","0"
