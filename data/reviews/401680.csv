Sure, it may be tame by todays standards, but back then, this game was targeted by tons of groups. It wasn't that the game was bloody (though it is), but the manner in which the violence is depicted. Roughly 1/3 of the people you get ot kill in this game are civillians. Some of them will crawl along the ground after being shot, saying things like "I can't feel my legs". It does paint a pretty disturbing, if a bit darkly humorous, picture.\n\nSo what's it all about?\n\nThat's almost a mystery. What we know is, there's a guy named "Postal Dude" who is evicted from his home and is getting shot at by the authorities. If you read the manual, he believes a large portion of the population in his town have some sort of sickness. However, in-game, the messages before the levels are just bleak and sometimes downright evil. Aside from these messages, there isn't much to go on. As such, you can draw up tons of conclusions in this game. That's one of the things that makes it so intriguing (as well as the atmosphere in general). The whole game takes on a very, again, disturbing tone. Not quite Manhunt level of disturbing, but it can still be pretty unsettling.\n\nThe game is played from a top-down perspective. It controls, now, like a modern twin-stick shooter. Each level has a set number of people you have to kill (or you can opt to kill the entire population on the stage). Once you kill enough, the exit will open. It's a fairly short experience. Each level will take 4-5 minutes to clear (with the later stages taking a bit longer, obviously). There are 17 stages in all, as well as a Rampage mode where you try and string together kills to get a high score.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is simple. You point, you shoot, you walk, you shoot some more, you pick up more weapons and health, repeat this until the level ends. It's simple, and pretty fun, but it does wear thin pretty quickly (the game will be over before you're completely bored with it, though). The AI isn't particularly smart, but it does seem like some of the pathfinding issues have been ironed out since the original.\n\nGraphics-wise, the game looks fantastic when compared to the original. I thought that the newer character models did give it an overall more "cartoony" feel, but it's still a great upgrade. The redrawn maps are beautiful, and everything is animated nicely. However, if you don't know what to expect from the original Postal, this game will still look extremely dated if you're expecting a modern-looking game.\n\nSome of the sounds have been revamped, but most of the levels are still devoid of any kind of music. You still get the creepy ambient sounds, the great environmental sounds, and all the other good stuff, but I really wish that RWS would have composed some tracks for the campaign. Rampage mode does have music, and it's very up tempo and fits in with the gameplay.\n\nOveral, Postal Redux accomplishes what it wanted to. It updated the graphics, gameplay, and overall experience of the original Postal. Is Postal still a good game to play in 2016? It's definitely fun in small doses, but it does come off as very primitive these days. I still enjoy myself, but I can understand how someone would favor newer twin-stick shooters over this game.\n\n+ Graphical overhaul\n+ New weapons\n+ Rampage mode\n+ Still as atmospheric as ever\n+ Revamped controls\n\n- Short\n- Very basic when compared to newer games of its kind\n\nFor fans of the original Postal: 9/10 (doesn't include expansion levels)\nFor newcomers: 6/10\n\nIt would have been a bit higher, but $15 for this game, if you've never played Postal and don't exactly know what you're getting into, it might seem a bit steep. It's a definite purchase at <$10","May 20","true","15.9"," 84 of 94 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","84","94","2","0"

On a serious note, the control is FAR better than what the original POSTAL had. This time around, I was able to ambush and bomb rush the enemies that are out for my blood. With the new controls, I was able to dodge missles and other projectiles more easily than in the original game. As for the presentation, the hand drawn stages look really nice and mesh well with the 3D models of the characters. Another thing that I liked was the wide variety of NPC's that you can kill and the animations that play when they're not quite dead yet.  I also enjoyed the inclusion of the revolver, as it allowed me to kill most enemies with one hit. Additionally, the new Rampage mode is tons of fun, as I found it thrilling to gun down as many people as I could in the area around me.\n\nAlthough I find POSTAL Redux a good game, I have some issues. First off, although I praised the presentation earlier, sometimes dead bodies clip through the various objects in the scenery, which kind of bothered me. Another thing I didn't like is how they didn't elaborate of Postal Dude's background and why he's doing this whole thing in the first place. Instead, the game just throws you into the action after the title card for the level. Additionally, I disliked how the enemies in the stages didn't really try to come after you once the level started. Instead, they would stand around until you approached them or shot them while they were standing there. Finally, I don't like how the game doesn't elaborate on who the people at the end of the game are, as it leaves us wondering who are the people keeping the Dude locked up.\n\nDespite all this, I find POSTAL Redux to be far superior to the original game that came out in 1997. If you are a fan of the POSTAL series, top-down shooters, and shooting everything in your path, than this game is for you. If this doesn't quite tickle your fancy, check out POSTAL 2 instead.\n\nMy final score is a 8/10","May 20","true","3.2"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","57","65","2","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingcomedy/recommended/401680/","amazingcomedy","erik6767","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingcomedy/","107 products in account","After waiting for this game to come out since the moment it was announced, I'd say that my opinions about POSTAL Redux are a bit mixed. I like this game, but I wanted to love it. Here are the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n*Better gameplay than the original, it plays like an actual 3/4 isometric shooter, no-more tank controls.\n\n*Rampage mode is awesome, especially that alternate ending!\n\n*The new remastered OST is amazing, I just wish that all of them were remastered and not just most. Also amazing are the tracks for Rampage mode\n\n*The levels are even more gorgeous than the originals, and I like how animated they are with car lights flicking on and off and flies around garbage, among other things.\n\n*The new revolver and carnival levels are awesome, I love shooting clowns!\n\nCons:\n*Biggest one, the new ending. I understand why RWS changed the original ending, but what they replaced it with is just boring. The original ending sequence with the school kids was shocking and gut wrenching, it left me shivering by the time the credits rolled. Here, the ending is just...I don't get it. Why is he at a grave? Why is he fainting? The original ending had an obvious meaning showing the depths of the P. Dude's madness, here I have no clue what's going on. And as much as RWS may deny it, they certainly did change it because of outside influence, Vince Desi even says as much in their recent Playboy interrview.\n\n* The new cutscene art is a mixed bag. While they're certainly faithful recreations, I feel they're too smooth, too digital. Maybe this is due to tech limits of computer screens in '97, but the original artworks had texture to them, they all looked gritty and acidic, like you'd burn your hand if you reached out and touched them. In Redux, some of the art is amazing, like the Construction Site and Trailer Park, but others like the Parade and the Mine look cartoonish, almost like they're from a children's story book. I wish RWS had gotten Randy Briley, the original artist from '97, to do remakes of his old work.\n\n* Weapons need for umph to them, right now they're rather unexciting to use. They need to sound louder, deadlier, they ought to push the player back, have recoil, feel like actual guns. Also, they oughta be balanced more in terms of when the player gets them. Halfway through the game the player already has most weapons.\n\n\nI suppose that's it, besides some misc. glitches which I'm sure RWS will fix through patches. Like I said, mixed feelings, but I'd go so far as to say that if you love the POSTAL series and wanna support RWS and don't mind the cons listed above, go ahead and buy it.","May 23","true","8.2"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","50","58","0","4"

Well, congrats you are litterally every person that played Postal 1 ever.\n\nAnd the best thing about Postal Redux are the controls. The game feels great now and killing people is more fun than ever.\nYou can also change weapons with the mouse wheel now.\n\nThe graphics still have the same style of the original, the models have been updated and look a lot better than before. Postal Dude got some new animations and can execute with every weapon now. Crushing skulls with the rocket launcher or burning half dead people with a flamethrower. Everything is possible.\n\nA great inclusion to this redux version is "Rampage Mode" in which you try to get the best score by keeping a high killstreak and using everything your gun arsenal has to offer. This mode also has an amazing soundtrack to really go postal with.\n\nSadly there are a few things that drag Postal Redux down. RWS included a whole new level but four levels that came with the "Special Delivery" Expansion Pack did not make it into the game. Also the multiplayer is still missing just like in the Postal 1 Steam release.\n\n\nA lower price would have been better for this game. If RWS manages to give us the "Special Delivery" maps and some sort of multiplayer then I could recommend this game to anyone for the price of 15 €.\n\nThe game itself is great, only the lack of content is a bit dissapointing.\n\nFor now I suggest you try the original Postal first.

So what is POSTAL Redux? POSTAL Redux is a high definition remake of original POSTAL. In this game you take control of guy named Postal Dude who (as his name suggests) is going postal. Your objective here is simple: Kill anyone who stands in your way before he can kill you. You can choose from wide variety of weapons that have been in original POSTAL, but also whole new revolver weapon. You have chance to see 17 levels from POSTAL remastered in high definition, including a new level called Carnival.  The game now of course has much better sound quality and also HD loading screens art, HD sprites and HD levels background. Oh and the controls are now  much  better, while the controls in original POSTAL felt kind of clumsy, in this game they are pretty nice... So will you like this game? Well that's very subjective, so I can't really tell for sure but if you are fan of POSTAL or similar games i think you may like it and even if you haven't played POSTAL (or any other game from Postal series) i still recommend you to at least give it a shot and see if you like it.","May 22","true","2.1"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","24","30","0","0"

I received POSTAL 2 from a friend only a couple years ago. I played POSTAL 1 shortly after falling in love with POSTAL 2, and once Paradise Lost came out I was in love again. But then, once I'd played Paradise Lost as much as I could, I fell out of the loop again. Until recently anyway.\n\nPOSTAL Redux is an HD remake of the game that started it all, POSTAL. And I couldn't possibly be happier to say that it's nothing short of amazing.\n\nPositives:\n+Rick Hunter. I don't care if this is a cop out. He has a voice of gold, and as long as he lives, The Dude will live.\n\n+It kept it's dark humor. When I see games based on "Dark humor" I always get worried what they mean by that. Do they mean that they occasionally make a slightly offensive joke, or do they do it RIGHT. POSTAL managed to do it right, and Redux kept it. When you pull a flamethrower out and hear the words "Need a light?", or pull a revolver out and hear The Dude laugh, you know that it's just good.\n\n+They actually added stuff as well ISN'T THAT FUNNY FOR A SUPPOSED REMAKE. No but seriously, a lot has been added, like a new ending, the ability to change your character to multiple separate colors, even back to the ORIGINAL Red Trenchcoat, a completely new game mode called rampage which is basically the rampage missions from the early GTA games in which you kill as many people as you can and count your score. Then there's my favorite, they added executions for all the different weapons. Now you're no longer restricted to executing with the M16/SMG, now you can execute them all with them all.\n\n+They fixed the controls. The original POSTAL controlled like a no armed man trying to use a chainsaw. AKA IT DIDN'T. The controls in Redux are now smooth, and best of all: PLAYABLE\n\nNegatives:\n-I have had the occasional bug. LIKE THE ONE WHERE AN ENEMY ROCKET KILLED AN INNOCENT AND IT COUNTED AS AN INNOCENT CASUALTY AND THEREFORE I LOST MY "NO INNOCENT CASUALTIES" BAR AND I WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR THE NO INNOCENTS KILLED ENDING AND I JUST HAPPENED TO BE BLOWN INTO THE EXIT WHEN I HAD ENOUGH KILLS SO THERE WAS NO DAMN WAY FOR ME TO KILL MYSELF AND RESTART AND THEREFORE I LOST 13 LEVELS WORTH OF KILLING NO INNOCENTS AND DYING BECAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY HIT ONE OR I TRIED TO AVOID ONE.\n\n8/10 is good","May 25","true","9.1"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","20","24","9","0"

The newly remastered art is fantastic and really makes the colors pop. A new Carnival level takes advantage of the new 1080p style with lots of colors and high resolution art. Not to mention the much improved controls. It controls beautifully now, a massive improvement upon the original which was one of my biggest gripes of it.\n\nAlong with this, Redux adds a new Rampage mode that is very fun and fast paced. It is a score based mode which rewards fast and creative gameplay. The new Revolver weapon also packs a satisfying punch and Rick Hunter's sexy voice is still the stuff of legends.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not quite finished yet. A co-op multiplayer mode will be coming some time which I am sure will be great fun for friends who want to go postal. Along with this, the DLC maps for Special Delivery will be remastered and released in a future free update for Redux.\n\nThat being said, I don't know why the old ending was replaced with this new one other than the old ending was too controversial even for RWS to redo. This is a shame as the original ending level was one of the most shocking moments I ever faced in a video game, and the new ending leaves no impact other than a big "huh?"\n\nBotched ending aside, POSTAL Redux is still a very well done remake, but I say wait a bit until either the multiplayer and DLC maps get added or there is a sale to purchase it.

This version was remade from the ground up and is even using a new engine. The new artwork and graphics look great and are well made. The contols feel great when using a keyboard & Mouse. The music, sound effects, and voice acting is excellent. The original Postal Dude's voice is back again and sounds great. The weapons feel well balanced and gives you a large combination of ways to handle any situation.\n\nJust like the original the main game is short at about 2 hours on a full clear of all levels. Don't let that detour you from the game because the new Rampage Mode extends the games life. In Rampage Mode you have to clear the map and try to rack up a high score. You will get a number of weapons to use and many ways to complete a full clear of the map. Enemies are more challening in Rampage Mode adding a level of challenge and fun to the game.  It has been stated by the devs that more free content is on the way. Special Delivery and Multiplayer is planned and will be released once it's ready.\n\nIf you are a fan of Postal and Postal 2 what are you waiting for just buy it, and have a ball, because this game is well worth it. Hatred players come on and give this game a try too. For anyone that loves twin-stick shooters give it go as well, because this game is perfect for you. For anyone else that may be new to the Postal series just give it a go and see if you like it.","May 20","true","4.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

It not blazing fast like Hotline Miami, nor is it some top down tactical shooter, but its also not a standard twinstick with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of people being thrown at you, like Total Carnage or Smash TV. To describe it, I'd say its like a bunch of seperate scenarios being put together to make a cohesive level. Some levels are smaller or more populated and end up playing out as almost non stop fighting, as you inevitably will anger one crowd while fighting another. Other levels are more spacious and allow you to come up with a simple strategy to follow through on when you move in. Its a great mix of thinking before you act, and acting without thinking.\n\nThe improvements all around from the original Postal 1 are all welcome. The controls are smooth as silk, and you no longer need a controller to have twinstick style controls. Some weapon rebalancing is also present, and working with the new control scheme the gameplay has more skill and strategy to it rather than just "crawl forwards slowly and pray to ♥♥♥♥ing jesus you dont die." The overall sound design is fantastic once more, and the atmosphere is just as stellar as it was in the original game. Also you can wear the original Red Coat, or pink if you're feeling particularly gay like I do sometimes.\n\nCurrently though, one thing to remember is this game as of whenever this is being posted, the game is an investment. Right now you get a solid campaign that lasts different lengths of time depending on the difficulty (about 1 hour on normal, 3-4 on hard), and you get the rampage mode if you enjoy score attack type stuff. RWS has confirmed co-op, deathmatch, the expansion levels, brand new levels, iirc a nightmare mode difficulty, and potentially a few extra things if all goes well. RWS is really ♥♥♥♥in' passionate about Postal Redux and it shows with how much they're talking about it. RWS is a fantastic company and you are certainly going to get more content than there is in it right now. Hell if anything just buy the game to support RWS cause they're ♥♥♥♥ing awesome people.\n\nalso Mike J Vince Desi Toploader/Kamek I'm still open for performing the act of fellatio on you fellas.

While the gameplay never really evolves past just shooting dudes, different weapons and level layouts keep the experience interesting.\n\nPostal Redux is more than just a graphical update, it improves the weapons, controls, enemy AI... everything. For example: In the original Postal only a couple of weapons actually felt useful and did decent damage. In Postal Redux all of the weapons serve a purpose, others are better at clearing out hordes of enemies and others are better at taking down strong individuals. Even the originally pointless mines are actually useful now!\n\nHowever even though the game is near perfect, there are still flaws. The screen is a bit too small and there's no way to look around like in for example: Hotline Miami, so there will be times where the enemy gets some free hits on you from off-screen. Original Postal did not have this problem since the enemies had admittedly bad AI, but here since they're so much smarter, you end up in some frustrating situations at times.\n\nBut all that aside Postal Redux is a fantastic game and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they would like some old fashioned mass murder.\n\n\n\nAnd ♥♥♥♥, it's still better than Hatred.","May 21","true","5.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I played the original game multiple times (even with its outdated controls) and I love the FPS sequel. I can safely say that this is a remaster done right.\n\nSTORYHonestly, there is basically no story. You play as the Postal Dude, a guy who is fed up of the world and goes postal (which is, go on a killing spree). Compared to its sequels, this is much more bleak and depressing and neither funny nor satirical. However, it also isn't offensive and controversial just for the sake of it (looking at you, Hatred).\n\nGRAPHICSThe game adopts the original isometric camera angle, and updates the look of the original art style, bringing back some good ol' nostalgia. Each level feels different from the other, ranging from city ghettos and mines, to carnivals and small towns with marching bands. The only thing that kinda looks outdated are the character models, and the environments do lack color variety, but it fits the grim tone that the game is going for like a glove.\nWhat I would really like to see in a future update is a little bit more gore: right now there are only head exploding if you execute people with the shotgun and burned bodies if they got hit by fire. I would love to see gibs when you use the rocket launchers, or limb removals when a grenade goes off.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is a twin-stick shooter with a simple goal: to kill every hostile in the level. You start off with a machine gun, and you slowly start acquiring an arsenal of death featuring shotguns, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, and even an all-new revolver. There are also civilians (and sometimes even animals) that can be killed, earning this game the title of controversial.\nThe controls are very smooth, especially compared to the original version: simply being able to aim and shoot using the mouse changes the entire game. There is also a new game mode called Rampage, which is a Score Attack mode with lots more civilians and enemies in the levels, encouraging the players to use different weapons and playstyles to get higher scores.\n\nCHALLENGEThe enemy AI is decent, and usually plays more on the defensive staying behind walls and covers instead of rushing towards the player. (On the higher difficulty levels especially), they deal a lot of damage, so keeping check of the location of every single health pack in the levels is paramount.\n\nSOUNDThe updated soundtrack and sound effects are great: the hard-rock music pumping through the levels keeps the adrenaline up to 11, and the screams of agonising civilians who are about to get their head blown off by a shotgun blast are oh so satisfying.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe game features the original 17 levels (with the ones from the expansion pack to be released later for free) and the new Rampage mode. Also, knowing the developers, the game will be constantly updated for years to come, and I wouldn't be surprised if they manage to add even more levels, Workshop support, multiplayer modes and even new DLC just like they did for the now 13-year-old POSTAL 2.\n\nOverall, this is a very fun and satisfying twin-stick shooter with good replayability and with multiple updates to come. Highly recommended to fans of the genre and of the original game. And it definitely is better than Hatred.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8.5\nChallenge: 8\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 8.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 4\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","June 3","true","3.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerean/recommended/401680/","kerean","ウジ CARRiON 死神","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerean/","34 products in account","(First off, if you want to know what I think of the first POSTAL, please read my review on it. I'm not really going to repeat myself in this review on any of the points I made in that review, instead I'm going to focus on what new things this redux brings to the original.)\n\nPOSTAL Redux in its current form, is good. But it has the potential to be great.\nIf you are a fan of the original, than this, I feel is the definitive version of the game for you. Transferring over to the UE4 engine, right off the bat let me just say that this version of the game controls like a dream for both keyboard & mouse, and controller. Gone is the clunky nature of the controls, now replaced with smooth and responsive ones. So instantly that's a huge plus in my book. Aiming is much more precise and easier, and there is now a health color coded crosshair on your enemies letting you know how much health they have and if they are in your range.\n\nAs of this review, the game only has the original base game's levels, minus the original ending, and with the addition of a brand new level; a carnival. Otherwise the objective is the same, strategically take out at least 90% of the hostiles, bystanders run around to be gunned down (or not), collect ammo and supplies, it's all the same. So if you had taken issue with POSTAL's gameplay first and foremost in the past. THIS REDUX WILL NOT CHANGE YOUR MIND. Turn away now and go play something else.\n\nThe new level fits in nicely, and even surprised me with a nod to the classic 1997 title "Blood". It continues to be darkly humorous with a new enemy type, a clown with what appears to be a balloon animal tommy gun. The game also offers a new weapon, the revolver, that has a high chance of insta-killing anybody. It personally brought back memories of Half-Life's overly powerful revolver, though I don't know if that was a nod to that series or not. Otherwise, all the classic weapons are here, save for some minor changes like the machinegun becoming a sub-machinegun, and the auto-shotgun using its own ammo now.\n\nThe game also ditches the stupid gauntlet mode and replaces it with something that has more meat on the bone. Rampage mode lets you pull together kill combos by killing fast and effectively with all your weapons. Get a high score and a grade and move on. It's a lot like Hotline Miami, and it's far more chaotic with a much more loud and aggressive soundtrack in the back. With more hostiles and more weapons to boot, this is another welcome addition.\n\nThe art has all been re-done, and scaled to fit modern screens. Gone is the muted and dithered coloring, all the colors are nice and rich, and while this is nice, there is one drawback. Personally, it feels a little too zoomed in at times. Much like "Hotline Miami 2", I've come across areas where I was being shot at off screen. This is a design flaw that can really irritate me and it could be easily fixed by either zooming the camera out a little or giving the player a camera shift key much like the first "Hotline Miami" (not a nerfed one like the sequel). A cool detail however is the addition of slightly changing scenery. Some things like gas tanks and gas pumps will actually explode now, as opposed to the cheesy illusionary tricks they tried to pull off in the original game (hiding barrels behind objects). However it would have been nice if they took it up a notch and made cars explode into metal pieces and fire as well.\n\nBesides the level art, the cutscene artwork and intermission artwork has also been cleaned up and updated, and I'm glad to say that, at least in my opinion, it retains that dark and disturbing atmosphere from the originals. The HUD is also cleaned up and looks nice.\n\nAs for the old voxel models, they've all been replaced with actual models and the art style has lots of people divided. I'd describe it as cartoony myself, and at first I really was not digging it at all. But with the promise of new content on the horizon, I've learned to live with it. Some things like blood and more gore effects however, are what the game really needs to tweak, as it feels a little weaker in the ♥♥♥♥ed up department of things compared to the original game. Which is a shame, POSTAL has always sorta been the darkest joke of the gaming industry (and I mean that in the nicest way possible, really.)\n\nThe ambiance I'm sad to say, is mostly missing as of this review, little things like the wolves howling and the dogs barking are gone. The music however is pretty much all remastered and sounds fantastic, though I honestly wish they'd let us play the creepy music while we play. I find the lack of it during gameplay greatly affects my enjoyment of the game. Also, while the original POSTAL's voice acting was as annoying as sin, I funnily enough find this one too quiet. All the overly cheesy lines seem to have been dropped, which is GOOD, but now people are far too silent. Again affecting the ♥♥♥♥ed up atmosphere. The voice actor for Postal Dude re-recorded his lines, and I honestly have to say they sound really tame and flat compared to the originals. Which is a damn shame, all the devilishness in his voice is gone, replaced with what sounds like boredom now.\n\nStory wise, it's all the same, minus the ending which I will not spoil for either game. An interesting note to make is, if you play on normal or easy, the diary entries are unchanged from their creepy originals. However if you play on hard, not only does a small detail in the ending change, but the diary entries change to the ones originally in the manual for POSTAL. Even more interesting, is rampage mode has its own, entirely special ending. So you're essentially looking at three endings here.\n\nAll in all, I know some people are disappointed with this redux. I think I can understand why too, after the release of Hatred, a game obviously inspired by the first POSTAL, I think a lot of people thought they were going to get a Hatred 2 with this, from Running With Scissors no less. The sort of godfather of this very niche style of games. The reality is this; they probably got sick of updating the antiquated original and decided to start fresh, to make it easier to deliver content to you in a much faster fashion. So, with the promise of more levels coming, more content coming, multiplayer modes, etc. I think this is a fair package for what it is. POSTAL updated for those who maybe never played the original and are curious of the series roots, or fans who enjoy it for what it is, but would gladly ditch the clunky controls and the take up the offer for more support.\n\nFor that, I recommend it for now. If the game doesn't get the content it was promised, I'd be iffy on it, but if this game gets the content it was promised, then I'd fully recommend it easily. Like I said, lots of potential here to make this a great product well worth your money.","May 31","true","11.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Although the original Postal was groundbreaking and highly controversial in 1997 when it was 1st released, trying to play it nowadays was a royal pain andddd got more boring and frustrating then fun. Not any more! What RWS and Jon M (in my opinion the best thing that's happened to Running With Scissors since Steve Wik) have done is bordering on genius. They made a 19 year old game something you now want to play again. Just hearing The Dude's voice not only makes this fun but makes me wanna jump back on the Postal sequel also for some long forgotten fun.  11/10 Stars and 4 thumbs up (don't ask up where).

And I've got to say, it's an awesome game.\nFor those who don't know, Postal Redux is a remake of Postal, a 1997 PC game.  You play as the Postal Dude, an archetypal mass murderer who snaps, arms himself and "goes postal".  Your goal is to murder a set amount of enemies in order to procede to the next stage.  In addition to the enemies are unarmed civilians, who you can choose to gun down or spare at your discretion.  To put it simply, Postal Redux plays like an arcade shooter (think Robotron or Smash TV).  The original Postal had some unique concepts, including hand drawn backgrounds and a disturbing view into the mind of a spree killer; however, it was marred by god awful controls, difficulty spikes and poor sound quality.  Thankfully, Postal Redux remedies these problems. While keyboard and mouse controls are still a bit bizarre, the controls are excellent with a joystick.  The visuals have been updated, and while the 3D models aren't triple A quality, the backgrounds are still illustrated nicely.  New content has also been added, including the highly powerful revolver, a carnival stage (with armed clowns!), and the new "Rampage" mode, which is a score attack, arcade-y mode focused on combo kills, variety and speed (complete with great music).\nWhile these revisions and additions are great, the game right now has one key issue: length.  Beating the campaign on hard takes a few hours at most, and as of right now, there's no multiplayer.  The Special Delivery maps and Super Postal maps are also missing.  However, multiplayer and new maps will be added in free updates in the future (according to Running With Scissors).\nAll in all, Postal Redux is an interesting game, much like the original Postal.  As wrong as it may seem to some, there's something I find therapeutic about gunning a group of digital people down, and thankfully, this is what Redux does best.  While the game is good, it's lacking in content currently, so if you have reservations about the game's length, wait for RWS to update it, or wait for a sale.  If you aren't a fan of psychological horror games or senseless murder, you may want to stay clear of this one: if you're a fan of the Postal series, psychological horror games, arcade shoot 'em ups, an angsty teenager, someone who likes to attack random pedestrians in Grand Theft Auto, or all of the above, I'd definetly recommend Postal Redux.\n\n>inb4 "Hatred clone"\n>inb4 CRAWLING IN MY FORESKIN","May 28","true","9.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I've played them all, even the dreaded Postal 3. I can say without a doubt this makes up for it, by going back to their roots and instead of changing many things like they do in most remakes kept everything the same, but added more things! They improved the graphics, sounds and imagery from the original Postal but kept it the same, which is very hard to do! The full price of £9.99 is fair as although it is much better than the original and is literally brand new - Running with Scissors is not nearly as well known and popular as it used to be, so if they had made it to pricy they'd have ended up selling a lot less. If I had to complain, it's because I feel like they need more quotes (Maybe some Postal 2 quotes? Just a few) and barely any music. I like and dislike the fact there's barely any music, it makes it more.. realistic I suppose; all you hear is the screaming of the masses as you fire your neverending hail of bullets. 9/10, that's definately what I'll put this as. I can't wait for the multiplayer update though!

However, I understand why RWS would choose to change the ending, to make it a lil less messed up, I just hope someone adds the original ending back in when workshop support is out\n\nOverall, if you liked the original Postal you will LOVE Redux\nIf you like Postal 2 and Haven't tried the original, I recommend playing this to see Postal from its roots (it will probably feel like a very arcade-ish postal game to people who only played the second game (which is why I love Redux so much))\n\nRedux feels just like a modernised version of the old game, especially with the updated controls 100/10","May 24","true","4.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Now that I've found out that the mouse is used to aim and shoot in this redux, it definitely changed my view simply cos I can finally see what the hell's going on.\n\nPostal Redux is funny in the most minimalistic way, just look at the loading screens. anyway, this game definitely outperforms Hatred by a long shot, with a plentiful variety of colors, a better narrator, replay value and quite artsy level transitions. Aside from the feeling as if you've already zoomed past the whole game once you've played it, or that the hostiles are easily exploitable, I say if you like Postal 2 and a few aspects from Hatred, then it's definitely worth a try. I also thought I should mention the women of this game. I'm no mysoginist, but ♥♥♥♥ I really hate them. You should too. I think it's meant to feel that way.\n\nAlso, unlike playing the unedited Postal 1, I've actually completed the first stage.","May 20","true","0.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

RWS team, well done dudes!   I played the original when it came out and loved it, I played Postal 2 when it came out and played it a lot, loved it.  This remake just blew my brain out!  The mouse controls, better graphics, constant mindfunk that is playing in the background to give me the same mental issues while playing the game... total atmosphere captured and delivered!   Absolutelty perfect.   BTW, loved the bit about the ostridges on a train... I actually behin yelling at that part and felt something special when it was over.

The controls are vastly improved, and the old maps look great remade in HD. It feels like Rick Hunter was out of the spirit. Compared to the old lines, he sounded kind of bored and lacked that bit of sarcastic-ness. Kinda like comparing the new/old Freddy from Elm Street.\n\nLooking forward to the coop modes, and Special Delivery maps too.","June 4","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is VERY simplistic and straightforward. It looks much better than the original version. If you liked the original Postal, this is a must. If you never played the original, you will find that the violence (and gore) is not very extreme compared to most of todays games, the theme tho is ultraviolent, so this isn't really appropriate for young little kids..... They didn't try to make anything better outside of the cosmetics, and to me that is both the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of Postal Redux.
