This isn't even worth free as the source code is nothing but how NOT to code in C# and there is very little actual game here. Graphics and Sound are generic retro of the asset store variety. The gameplay amounts to moving your mouse around and nothing more... Seriously, that is the whole of the interaction...

At least some players experience a bug where they die when they are hit by nothing. This happens quite frequently, and perhaps accounts for between 20 and 50 percent of all deaths to those experiencing it. Perhaps most people do not have this issue, though everyone I know who owns it does.\n\nI don't think I could recommend the game even if it worked as intended, mostly because the odd scoring system renders most of the gameplay meaningless.. You will spend the first few minutes mostly breaking even with very little score progress until the one enemy that is actually worth any score shows up. Your score then flies up for a few minutes until that enemy stops spawning for a while and then you wait for it to return.\n\nIf you do happen to experience that bug though, paired with the way the game scores, you can unfortunately expect to end most games with a very low score, prior to that enemy spawning. This is of particular interest to achievement hunters because the game may not be such a quick 100% if you have this issue. Dying that early for no reason can make a very long task of the "cumulative score" type achievements present in this game.","November 21, 2014","false","3.6"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","47","54","0","0"

"Blast 'Em" is probably what would happen. If the title didn't give it away, I'm sure the screenshots do.\n\nWith all the hundreds of space shooters and other bullet hell games why would you pick this one? There's nothing in this game you probably haven't seen before because if you have, you've never played a game like this.\n\nThe game is controlled by your mouse so if you are thinking about using your controller, don't bother. You do not have to click to shoot because your ship shoots automatically but obviously you will have to dodge incoming ships/bullets and hit them instead. There are powerups which make your ship shoot different directions and you can collect coins to get a better score.\n\nWhenever you get shot or hit an enemy ship/asteroid, you die instantly and it's game over. Since the game is really hard you will die a lot and do the same thing over and over again. Eventually only the hardcore Shoot 'Em Up fans will try to get all achievements and a higher score although I doubt they got the dedication to beat the same section and enemies everytime.\n\nThe graphics look average but what's worse is that there's no real change of scenery (look at the screenshots), at least I didn't see it.\n\nThere are tons of other and better choices like this game.

This is just as random and complex as those games were. Any price tag bigger than "free" is an insult to any Steam user and is another example of Steam's journey to became the junkyard of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. This game is something I would expect as free with every copy of Windows 95 or maybe an easter egg game in some 90's action game.  /rant\n\nNow for the game.\n\nOverview\nThis game aspires to be a shoot 'em up space game like R-Type. You go from left to right and shoot things. R-Type being 1987's smash hit is now available on Android for less then this garbage and manage to has thousand times more features and assets than this even being almost 30 years older.\n\nStory\nNo story.\n\nGameplay\nYou go right and shoot some random things in space while trying to dodge enemies and their projectiles. With no motivation whatsoever (except maybe getting achievements for grinding up score). There's no end game, no story, no other mode to play, no nothing. This is as basic as any game can get. Every enemy drops some money so you can "buy" power-ups. I need to use quotation marks because the power-ups just hang in space and you loose some of your score when you pick them up. And that's it. That is everything to be said about the gameplay of this game.\n\nYou can count features of this game on your two hands. It's propably only game on Steam where I can write down every single item featured in the game's content.\n\n1 ship\n3 types of "enemies" (drone that sometimes shoots, asteroid thing that does nothing except being there, flaming skull - yes, flaming skull which is very typical phenomenon to encounter in outer space)\n3 types of power-ups (faster shooting, three direction shooting and money-magnet)\n1 game mode\n1 song\n1 background\n6 buttons in menu\n\nVisual Presentation\nLook at one screenshot in the Steam gallery and you've seen everything.\n\nOverall\nThis game's assets and features can be easily topped by any game from Atari 2600. Yet for some reason this is sold for 3€. I have no idea why and I wouldn't recommend it anyone.\n\nI tought this might be some young kid's school project who tried and got it on Steam to earn a few bucks in order to pay off his student loan but I've seen around dozen of adults in credits section so I have no idea what happened there. I refuse to believe there was an actual "team" behind this and I'll stick to the kid school project story who propably made up fake credits so it looked better somehow.","July 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Pity me, for I paid for this crap.\n\nBlast Em! is a cheap little shoot em up that is all about surviving for as long as you can. Chances are, you won't be staying alive for long.\n\nStory\nThere really isn't one for this game. The Steam store page mentions something about defending the universe from evil alien robots, but there is nothing resembling a story once you start the game. Make up whatever excuse you like for why your pilot is flying his ship.\n\nPresentation\nVisuals are very basic. You have your ship, some different enemies, their bright red attacks, asteroids, coins and powerups. Resembles something you might have seen on the old Commodore 64 or Amiga home computers.\n\nOn to the sound. For the most part, the music is bloody awful. When starting the game, a track will be picked and played until you quit. Go into the options and mute it the moment you start the game. The sound effects are pretty poor. A constant sound effect for your own firing, another for enemy firing, crap explosion sounds for deaths of either you or them, and a few low quality words for when you start the level, die or grab one of the power ups.\n\nControls\nMouse only. Don't both  if you don't have a decent mouse. Everything is done by moving the mouse, and clicking the left button if you are on the menu. No keyboard or gamepad controls for this game, not even an option for them.\n\nGameplay\nVery simple. Move your mouse. Yeah, that is pretty much it. You mouse controls the movement of the ship, with firing being automatic. Move that mouse around, to dodge enemies and their attacks, asteroids , etc. Use your mouse to fly into coins dropped by destroyed enemies and asteroids. If you want to sacrifice some of your coins, which act as your game score, feel free to fly into a power up like Rapid Fire or Spread Shot, to get a temporary boost to your abilities. Now, continue this as long as you can, because the only way it will end is by you failing to move out of the way of a hazard.\n\nLifespan\nWell, if you want, you can try to rank well on the leader board, but seeing the higher scores, I wouldn't expect you to ever see yourself there unless you are willing to cheat like other users. There are also a number of achievements that are unlikely to keep people playing.\n\nClosing\nShort, simple and boring. Not worth the purchase at all.

The temporary upgrades each cost 10-20 coins which are essentially the only reason for playing this score attack jaunt. If you're working towards achievements here know that the Avoid collecting coins for 70,80,90, & 100 seconds achievements may pose a greater challenge for you. It seems simple right? Just don't get hit and don't get coins. The beginning of the game is set up to make this especially hard to achieve; So good luck getting past that 60 seconds achievement. There's also a macro achievement for collecting an accumulated score above 60000. This seems like a great thing to go ahead and mute the game while doing and throw on your favorite music playlist or several hours of your favorite podcast(s).\n\nI think this would be a much funner game with just a few modifications. For instance just make the upgrades cost 5 coins each. Better yet just make the upgrades cost nothing or permanent for that life once you get them. The controls are also a little odd. I'm really used to having controller support in most PC games. Almost everything I've played since getting Steam in 2012 has had good controller support. I ended up using the mouse in this game after some poor results at using joy to key and changing the control options in the launcher. I have a wireless mouse that works quite well. In this game the mouse seems to work great for about 45-90 seconds but the slightest movement can send the ship hurling across the screen at your peril.\n\nI should mention I actually like the music in this game well enough it seems appropriate to the gameplay. The game has like 5 audio tracks, if you run it in windowed mode and click off the window and back on to play the game it changes the audio track each time. I found this convenient because I had a few favorite tracks.\n\nAll in all I kind of like "Blast Em!" but feel I really shouldn't. Maybe I just don't respect my own time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AllTracTurbo/recommended/257630/","AllTracTurbo","AllTracTurbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AllTracTurbo/","651 products in account","Blast Em is a retro, arcade style, side-scrolling, procedurally generated, spaceship shooter. The game is very simple. The only control you have is to move your mouse. You don't even need to click to shoot, your ship will continually shoot as fast as it can.\n\nFrom what I have seen, it consists of 1 level that gets progressively harder with only 3 power-ups. Coins drop when you kill enemies. Harder enemies will drop higher value coins. Your score is entirely based on how many coins you pick up. Power-ups are dropped at certain intervals and they cost a certain number of coins if you decide to pick them up. These points are deducted from your score. The power-ups will wear off after a certain time and you will have to pick them up again.\n\nThe game is very difficult and each run will probably last from 30 to 90 seconds. You only have 1 life and if you collide with any enemy or projectile, you will die. The difficulty is partly based on the sheer number of objects moving on the screen at the same time. Also, with so many objects on the sceen, you can sometimes mistake the enemy projectile for a coin if you are not paying close attention.\n\nI would definetly recommend going in the options and completely turning off the screen shaking. With so much stuff moving on the screen at the same time, having the screen shake every time you kill an enemy makes it that much worse. It also messes with my eyes becuase it feels like my eyes are out of focus every time it shakes and that can really make you disoriented after staring at the screen for so long.\n\nI would also recommend turning off mouse acceleration if your computer has it on.\n\nIf you are looking for a very simple, but difficult, retro/arcade style, side-scrolling, spaceship shooter, then I would recommend it, although I would not pay the current $3 price. I feel like this is the kind of game that should be free to play on a website like newgrounds. I got it as part of a bundle and I am happy with it for what I paid.\n\nEdit: I barely gave this a thumbs up yesterday when I wrote this, but after playing it some more I have changed my mind. In the first 2 hours I played, I didn't experience the problem others complain about where you randomly die without getting hit by anything, but in the last hour it has happened at least 7 or 8 times. I also have come to the conclusion that this games high difficulty is not based on player skill, but on bad game design.

Coupled with the enemies and their bullets floating around, meteors, and enemies that divebomb you, there's simply way too much going on to figure out what's even happening so your best bet is to just move the mouse in a direction that looks unoccupied.","January 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There are very few enemy types and powerups. Your space ship is controlled with the mouse and has autofire on all the time. There are options to set up a controller or keyboard controls but they just don't work. The settings literally do nothing. The mouse controls are fine though and probably the best way to play anyway. The ship moves very fast which gives you the feeling you are moving a mouse cursor around on the screen. I got this for a few cents in a sale and that's pretty much what it's worth. The music is cool and the gameplay isn't that bad actually. It also might be interesting for achievement hunters because the achievements are very easy to get. All in all this game is lazily implemented and lackluster. It's not worth the full price.

The game in general boils down to how long you can survive without crashing or being hit. This sounds alot more simple than it actually is due to a obscene amount of items on screen at once, such as bullets, coins and ships. I myself wouldve put this down within minutes if I wasnt intrested in completing the achievements and once you give this game a little time it shows its true nature. Theres quite abit of strategy that comes into play..... you see you can get power ups, these wear out over time and so need renewing, you also have to pay for these power ups, so you find yourself juggling wether its worth collecting them or waiting for the next to show. If you die straight after picking one up then your score reflects this as score is coins. Something I havnt seen many people mention and thats the music, although only a few tracks play in repeat and after awhile they do grind on you, there pretty decent, one sounds terribly similar to oblivions theme tune, the film with tom cruise. Overall this game is simple beyond belief... but I find myself enjoying a quick blast on it and afterall thats all it ever offered.

You only get one life and no continues, and the only real goal is to survive as long as possible as you try to get a high score. The ship fires constantly on its own, so all you have to do is move it around with your mouse. Score accumulation is slow because you only increase it by collecting coins from defeated enemies, and powerups cost coins. So, you have to play for awhile before enemies that drop higher-value coins start appearing, and once they do, you're likely to get wiped out. This means redoing the easy, beginning portion of the game over and over and over again before getting your shot at a really high score. I'm not sure if the game goes on forever or if it has an ending, and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask.\n\nIt also has an annoying glitch that sometimes causes your ship to self-destruct for no apparent reason. The saving grace is that it often goes on sale for less than a dollar, so if your curiosity gets the best of you, just wait for a sale.\n\nRating: 2/5","May 5, 2015","false","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One allowed the player to shoot bullets from the top and bottom of the ship, while the other made the player shoot bullets.  When you collect a power up, you lose money.  This is an interesting design choice, however after you collect a power up, its effect appears to be permanent, and collecting multiple of the same power up does not make the effects get better.  It therefore becomes an inherent goal to avoid power ups after collecting them once.\n\nEDIT:  Another annoying aspect of the game is the lack of health the player has.  One hit from anything will always kill you.\n\nAnother frustrating thing about the game is the lack of a pause screen.  For a game that is an on rails shooter, with the goal being to accumulate as many points/kills as possible, being unable to pause the game in order to answer the door, feed a pet, etc. is very frustrating.\n\nInstead of this game, I would recommend games from the DigiPen Game Gallery[games.digipen.edu], which are generally of higher quality and free.","August 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","6"

The gameplay speaks for itself: travel across the screen to the right while shooting baddies.\n\nWhat I really like about this game is how the power-ups work with your score. The pick-ups you can get cost you money, money that you pick up after obliterating stuff; therefore, don't be greedy and grab too many pick-ups or you'll lack a high score (like some reviewers on here complain about...). This is what i mean by developing a strategy. I grab one type of power-up and when I'm depleted I grab it again, spending 10 coins, that's not greedy that's just smart. If you grab a power-up while your current one is already active then you just wasted money! So you have to avoid power-ups sometimes too, aswell as enemies, flaming skulls, and asteroids!\n\nMy high score is 371 after an hour or so of play (currently 1175) and the achievements are DEFINITELY attainable under 10 hours easily. I've got 50% in one hour. Edit: Just completed in 9.9 hours according to Steam lol\n\nI'm hooked :)\n\nFYI: I never encountered random deaths, others likely just hit something and died, face it.

It's a simple but deceptive little thing.\n\nSo the core is, essentially, you move around a bit and shoot some things. Points are added by coins dropped by the enemies, power ups deduct points so you've got to be careful as a careless run of power ups wipe out your score in no time. Unless you concentrate, you'll lose control of the situation really, really easily.

Coins pay for power-ups and Coins and your Score)\n♦ Achievements are kind of hard to get which makes you want to keep playing to achieve them\n♦ Challenging\n♦ Autofire\n♦ Couple of Hours of Fun\n\nNegatives:\n♦ No Weapon Upgrades\n♦No Ship Upgrades\n♦ No lives\n♦ No sense of levels or stages (You just play until you die and repeat)\n♦ Screen Shake could give people problems (Luckily you can turn it off)\n♦ No way to see your Steam Friends Highscores, only global.\n♦ Killing enemies doesn't give score, only picking up coins does\n\nImprovements:\n♦ Could have made it that killing enemies give Score\n♦ Could have made it that picking up coins could be spent in a shop later on Weapon/Plane Upgrades\n♦ Could implement levels\n♦ Could implement a way to see friends highscores, not just global\n\nOverall, in my opinion, the game is fun, adictive to a point and challenging. Now don't get me wrong as mentioned above it has it's bad points and could do with some improvements in my opinion. But it has many good points such as challenging achievements and to get on the top of the leaderboard which make you want to keep playing it. Also, for it's price, I'd say it's worth at least buying if you are bored and want to kill some time.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 3/5!","November 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The mechanics are a welcome twist while yet being a double edge sword. Your gun fires automatically and the enemy's bullets travel slow, you would think this would make it easier.... You would be dead wrong. For starters the enemy bullets will decelerate till they come to a stand still and exit stage left. I found myself watching the bullets cross by my ship only to run into the same bullet one second later because I thought the bullet would have been off screen already. I also constantly found myself ramming head first into many enemy ships waiting for the next bullet to come but it never does. With each enemy having a differing speed and every enemy bullet shot being of varying velocities multitasking is key. For a bullet hell shooter, this is one of the hardest. Don't be fooled by this game's apperance, it will bite you!\n\nI recomend this to all Arcade gamers.","October 30, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dev seems to be aware of it but hasn't fixed it yet. About every sixth of my games has ended this way. But the individual sessions being so short due to the ramping difficulty make it a bit less aggravating. Suprisingly addictive. Once you have the game figured out you can semi-reliably be getting between 500 and 1000 points per run, making the achievements not that daunting. Even though it recently had a permanent price reduction I still think it's too much.

What I believe is the biggest flaw about this game, aside from lack of content and substance, is the controls.\n\nI was never able to re-map my controls from the mouse to the keyboard. There was no help in doing so, despite options to change the controls in the launcher. Combined with a clunky interface and minimalist gameplay, there were no shining elements that really make this game stand out, or even meet the par of similar games in this genre.\n\nAs another review pointed out, this game looks, feels, and plays like somebody's first game design. And for that reason and many others, I don't recommend this game.","June 8, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I can certainly appreciate a minimalistic design, and love a good side-scrolling bullet hell game, there's just not enough to do in Blast Em! to recommend it at *any* price.\n\nThe visuals are extremely generic pixel art, the audio is utterly forgettable, and the controls feel stiff and unrefined. There is no story (not that this genre is known for its storytelling), no upgrade path, and extremely little variation in design from one minute to the next. There are free Flash games that look and play a lot better than this.\n\nI hate to rag on a game that an indie developer put hard work into. However, it doesn't seem like very much work went into this game, compared to other titles in the genre in the same price range.","April 5","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the three bucks.\nI, myself, got this from Humble Bundle which cost me a dollar for a bunch of games, so I guess that is decent enough.\n\nGame features:\nOne ship type.\nFour enemy types.\nTwo projectile types, one of which is your own.\nThree upgrades.\nOne background.\nThree soundtracks.\nTwenty three (!) achievements.\nThere are more achievements than there are game features combined.\nIt's retro-style, I get it, but that does not mean that a game has to have so little features.\n\nAmong other unpleasant things:\n-Wonky spaghetti code that sometimes kills you with something invisible.\n-Excessive eye candy which gets in the way of gameplay. It can not be disabled.\n-Hacked leaderboards.\n\nI cna sum up my experience with the following:\nWent to a thousand in score and then got killed by simething invisible. Upon further investigation (used a speed hack and very low speed), there's a nasty bug that winds up killing you with either an invisible projectile, enemy or what have you, which is terrible to have in a game where you only have one hit point. You'll get frustrated or bored, maybe both, within the first five minutes.\n\nIt would be decent as a freeware game that you play for a few minutes and forget about, but it's not free. If I were you I'd save the three bucks and move on.\n","May 19","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Use the coins at the end to buy upgrades which last 1 round.\n2. Upgrade the ship each time you achieve a new rank, gaining an extra life and better weapons.\n\nMake enemies a little more exciting, it feels like i'm playing space invaders on LSD.\n\nBosses? Perhaps there are some... but I haven't seen any.\n\nDifferent backgrounds to mix it up a bit.\n\nDifferent ship skins which can be unlocked.\n\nQuests? An option that will take a bit more work, but having quests usually makes a game a little more interesting.\n\nAs it stands, it is pretty mindless.","May 17, 2015","false","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
