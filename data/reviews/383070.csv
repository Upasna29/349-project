From what was initially an interesting take on “BSG”’s episode “33” (the first episode of Season One), where you must enter a sector of space and rescue transports and/or engage enemy supply stations/fleets. The player has 90 seconds before the FTL drives spool up and in that time the player has to survive what can be an onslaught of enemy craft. Survive that, attend your fleet and jump. But don’t leave it too long to jump, as more enemies are on their way.\nAs I said, ‘initially’ this was about it. The Devs aren’t happy to sit on their laurels, though and the game has grown, and keeps growing with asteroid fields to contend with, attacks on your home base to defend against and now commanders and pilot attributes added. Next, full-fledged missions are being implemented. With each patch/build, and they are fast and furiously with these, the Devs not only welcome feedback but actively seek it, so much so that the game feels very much like a community-driven project. And the game just keeps improving as a result. The graphics, using the Unreal 3 Engine can look ark and a little ‘muddy’ at times, but even these are being constantly tweaked and addressed. I don’t remember even “Homeworld” receiving this much love when it first came out, and many gamers caved on that title as the difficulty wore on many gamers. There are challenges with this title too, bugs at first, but now an efficient and often tricky A.I. There have been hurdles yes, but as the game keeps growing these are dealt with leading this very long time gamer actually excited to see what is coming next. As it is, the game is very playable and filled with enough content to have you coming back for more…just one more jump. You can research new ship designs, improvements to your current fleet and special abilities.\nAs a fleet-based RTT (more so than an RTS) I haven’t found anything quite like it and for the asking price…..do yourself a favour and just buy it. You will not be disappointed.","January 29","true","26.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

But the idea behind is good. I like the graphics. It needs work on how to give ships special orders and the resources you get in a mission are not enough.

With that in mind I say Yes but with reservations.\n\nHaving played around with this a little while I always keep coming back to the idea that this is a tablet game. Maybe it actually it is, maybe it isn't, honestly didn't care enough to look that up.\n\nThe game looks decent enough but controls like.. [Insert appropriate metaphor here]. Not hotkeys than I can find for ship selection, clicking in the list focuses the camera when I don't want it to, trying to find an individual ship to select to activate any special abilities in the middle of a cluster♥♥♥♥ is next to impossible, especially smaller ships.\n\nA huge opportunity for something amazing was missed here, the description gives the impression of some vast universe and everyone in it is out to get you. Not true, you jump from small arena box to small arena box with no choice except Unknown or Homebase (Probes and research eventually open this to 3 choices or home). Still just little arena boxes though.\n\nEverything always starts off within shooting range, no time to really move your fleet, no need/use for any form of tactical play, launch fighters, set weapon power to max, fight with a bad UI to click ships and launch missile/plasma/whatever abilities. (The arena boxes and this bit are why this feels so much like a tablet game).\n\nAll that said though, when this game is on sale for a few bucks it may still be worth your time. You probably won't fall in love with it, it won't be something you'll brag to your friends about and I highly doubt you'll still be playing this in 6 months time, yet you may get a few decent hours out of it.\n\nTL:DR: A tentative recommendation at a hefty discount, tablet style game/UI that could potentially pass a few hours.","April 24","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As a fan of BSG, and especially the tension of "33", I'm happy this game is here. That said, as things stand, it's very clear it's still in Alpha. Tooltips say things like "We can put text here in a smaller font". Ships have command buttons (like fire turrets/fire missiles) which are duplicated in x & y axis, and yet pushing on either of them does nothing. Which is the basic problem it has as things stand, the only button which obviously does anything is 'jump'. That does jump you to a new sector. But when you get there, there may or may not be friendly ships there. If there are, there's no obvious way to tell (if you hang in battle for a while, you may suddenly read '1611 civilians killed'). The first couple of systems, you're likely to find civilians, take them back home, they unload, then.... there's no running count of how many you have, how many you need. When you jump to a new sector, there's no sense of progression, either that you have to search a certain number, or travel a certain distance (as you're always 1 jump from Home Base). There's no obvious way to tell ships to fire on other ships (whilst you can left click on your ships to get their name/health, and left click enemy ships to see likewise, does left clicking yours then left clicking theres order targetting? Or, rather, is it meant to? As it doesn't appear to.) Rather than the normal convention of middle wheel zooming, middle wheel switches between your ships. Not sure if zooming is possible, or if that's what's meant to happen when you push mouse to top of screen. If you jump to a supply depot, and destroy all the enemy... did destroying the ships get you the supplies the system had? There seems no way to take the fuel & metal on board. I don't know if it was supposed to happen automatically in battle, if a 'get resources' system is to be implemented later, or what.\n\nAll in all, after a few hours, I'm rather bemused. The concept is great, the execution is blah, the interface is horrible. Who knows what's going to be changed & fixed as development goes on - I'm not unhappy I bought it to support further development, but I can't imagine I'll be playing it again until there have been a lot of updates.","August 25, 2015","false","3.3"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","23","42","0","1"

At $8 I hardly see any reason not to pick it up if you like this sort of game.  i like the idea of battlestar galactica scenerio of rescuing other ships and then jumping away before re-enforcements can come.  The graphics are also nice for this type of game and it does seem like it is only going to get better.

Many different events to keep you intrested.\n2. Challanging Enermy AI (the enermy is not stupid).\n3. Also a good Allied AI that uses abillities as well.\n4. Research is at a steady pace and well balances.\n5. You ships weapons only target the correct ships there designed to kill, such as your large weapons on your command ship will only target large enermy ships and not waste time trying to hit fighters etc.\n6. Each ship has well balanced skills and stats why still making it that you are not over powered\n7. Regular updates that add new content to the game.\n8. A Developer that listenings to the players and is in constant contant.\n9. Realistic, which makes this game great, for example you may come across transport carrying civilians that you may want to try and rescue but you might finid yourself out numbered and forced to make a decision, risk trying to save them all or put the safetly of your fleet first.\n10. No risk, no gain, sometimes you have to take risks to get good rewards, such as answering a destress call, sometimes it could mean new friends or sometimes it could be a trap to lure you in.\n\nAll together these 10 points and more in my opinion make this game great and I am happy to support it 100% of the way :)","February 1","true","11.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

While in early access, the game has a lot of nice features, which I recommend you try out for yourself.

The conept seems neat, but the UI is very.. sloppy.  Buttons don't really react when you click them, and the feed back isn't good on them, no beeping, and its not intuitive.  And I don't mean like, intuitive as its advanced, its really NOT advanced, like "Repair" .. but does it repair? I don't know, nothing happens.. no feed back when I click it.  You tell fighters to attack, and... do they?  sometimes... mostly not, no beeping, clicking, no combat chatter, nothing.  You really just kinda watch the battles.  And they are really bad battles, mostly with icons fighting instead of actual ships.  I'll be honest, its a bad game.  Sure its early access, but they said they are planning to leave early access in a month and this game is NO WHERE NEAR close to a 'game'.

This looks badass!" So I set up my world and enter...I try and read the tips to help you get started butI could only read about half of them because it gave you 3 seconds... So I said "It's early acces and there probally will be a few glitches and bugs." 15 min into the game and I have about 50 freighters. At the time everytthing was swell,had a few hades and nyx's.20 min later I have 1000 out of 210... My game was about to kill itself.I chose not to go back to my base because my computer would crash.Well...being myself I went back to my base when there was 50000 freighters on accident......................When I came to reality and saw how many freighters I had my mind went blank. It's game breaking glitches like these that need to be fixed ASAP.The only reason I am going to reccomend this or give it a thumbs up is because it has so much potential for it to be a good game,but the state that it;s in now is very hard to play without your computer crashing.

Take "ideas" like this to kickstarter or something until you have a more finished product!.\n\nMaybe in 6 months this game will actually have some content and I will update this review.
