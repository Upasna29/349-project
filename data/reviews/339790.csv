Before I played this game, I didn't care about racing sims. When my friend showed me this game however, I fell in love. It was the game that made me want to buy a race wheel.\nThis game is so much fun to play, the physics are great and the AI are very challenging. The thing that drew me, however, was the mods. This game has a HUUUUUGE selection of mods available, adding new cars and tracks ranging from a large number of different types. You can add movie cars, old F1 cars, dirt tracks, freaking trucks, even stupid stuff like horses and... a toilet car. Almost anything you can imagine has been modded at somepoint. I spent hours just playing just downloading mods and driving them around.\nSo long as you can look past the slighty outdated graphics, this is a great game to buy.","March 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 94 of 109 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","94","109","5","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oktyabr/recommended/339790/","oktyabr","[CoFR]October","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oktyabr/","75 products in account","My review, 2015 EDITION:\n\n$20+ for a game that's 10 years old??!?  OK, a bit of a disclaimer:\n\nIF you are looking for modern graphical "eye candy", of course look elsewhere (Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, etc.)  No, rFactor doesn't look that great by today's standards.\n\nIF you are looking for hundreds of different cars and tracks, YES, rfactor can give that to you, mostly for free!  rFactor is possibly the greatest racing sim for *modders* of all time.  There are literally thousands of custom tracks, cars, skins, and extra goodies out there for this game and most of them won't cost you a penny... just a little time and trouble to find them and install them correctly.  "Out of the box" rFactor doesn't offer a whole lot.  The Lienz Festival of Speed is good fun and the other content, what there is of it, is pretty decent, but really this sim is about what you do AFTER you buy and install it.  That's where the real value lies!  Before buying this game I recommend just searching google for "rfactor" and see what you come up with.\n\nSome sites in particular cater to this sim, such as www.rfactorcentral.com\nOthers, like www.nogripracing.com also have a ton of downloadable content for it.\nAnd if you want to do an all in one package, check out http://www.bockbierbude.de/  Just make a free account, install their python app and point it towards your rfactor install.  The app will download a huge variety of cars, skins, and tracks, while you wait, and updating them is just a couple of clicks away.\n\nAlso while not all cars/mods support it I highly recommend installing a plugin called "Realfeel".  This will give the compatible cars force feed back (assuming you are using a wheel!) that is still top notch, even by today's standards, and arguably much better than some much newer sims and racing games.\n\nSo is the $20+ price a good value?  If you are willing to do a bit of work, downloading and installing stuff, it is STILL TODAY the best value in sim racing out there!   I'm not sure any other sim is capable of fielding 100+ cars at once in a full blown ADAC/VLN challenge!  ;)","March 12, 2015","true","4.3"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","43","47","0","0"

It's going to be a lengthy one, but I reckon it's a worth while.\nHere's a quick summary of what I will write (Split between Pros and Cons). Lengthy write up below.\nPros:\n-Many 'completed' mods\n-Still actively played\n-Customisable\n-Realfeel plugin (Best FFB ever), Especially with HistorX\n-HistorX is a must play mod - The sound in the game is FABULOUS.\n-Brings a smile :)\n-Never too old, or tired\nCons:\n-Need to create multiple rFactor files\n-Complexity in dumping mods in files\n-Not all are match-files friendly\n-No more development in game\n-Spend HOURS getting mods to work ( On many ocassions)\nRecommended Mods :\n-HistorX Touring Cars\n-Honda NSX/Corvette C6\n-Endurance Series (EnduRacers)\n-GPC 1979\n\nLengthy write up:\nYes, it's a game a decade ago. Why not get rFactor 2, GSCE, AC? By no means, I'm saying you should buy just this 1 game and ignore the rest. If you could own all of them, get all. But if you had to decide on 1, this would be it.\nThis is literally multiple games for the price of 1. Mods like HistorX, GPC 1979, Endurance series, Honda NSX etc. In particular, games with realfeel plugin brings heaven to the game. I'd dare say particularly the HistorX mod has the best FFB in any sim. What's more they are free. No Pay-to-play DLCs. These Modders deserve the respect. Salute.\n\nThis game is highly associated to Stock Car Extreme (SCE) because it uses the same engine - Gmotor. Now SCE, undoubtly, is a game that I'd say stand a fair fight. Why did I put rFactor > SCE? Purely because of the 'finished'/'completed' feel of a game. Everything in rFactor feels right. Now be cautious, this game isn't meant to be played with its based game. You are supposed to play mods with it. And I highly recommend to play with mods with "REALFEEL PLUGIN IN MIND FROM THE START" (as quoted by my friend). SCE is probably the most completed package as Reiza is constantly bringing new features, updates. This would be the 2 sims i'll get. Let say it this way, if you want a 'plug-and-play' game, it's SCE as I find the game fundamentally good enough that it doesn't need mods. If you want MORE FUN, rFactor.\n\nI've been in SimRacing for 8 years now. I've played rFactor, iRacing, SCE, netKar Pro, followed the development of Assetto Corsa. I was borned into rFactor, as it was my first sim. Done league races and till today, even though it's on/off, it still brings joy to me and excitement which many new titles struggle today. I've never had the surge to play the game again on the new modern titles.\n\nIn conclusion, the price does sound ridiculous for a decade old game. But I still see the longevity in the game for the upcoming years. Easy to set-up dedicated host servers, MANY mods. In fact, most of the mods are the definition of the current modern sims we have today. This game is the 'Metaphor Of the All Sims' being developed today. I'd rate this game 9.99/10 (the 0.01 for the awful default cars, but see it as a perfect score ;) )\n","March 11, 2015","true","56.0"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","1"

Unique cars and tracks make this a great adition to any racing fans library. This is still a very good racing simulator many years later. The graphics and effects aren't special but it gives you a good solid racing platform that includes what you need. This game has been out for quite some time which means a lot of mods have been created that make the game so much better. If you enjoy tandem drifting or drifting this is a must have for any drift sim player. The physics make it an unparalleled experience.\n\nPros:Good wheel support but requires quite some tweaking\nGreat community and pretty active player base\nClassic track selection\nRealistic physics that create great immersion\nDifficulty and race environment options\n\nCons:Weak career or campaign mode\nVery difficult control setups\nDeveloper made cars without mods\nBarely any tuning or customization\n\nConclusion:This is definitely a solid racing simulator. With the realistic physics and good wheel support this is a great game for any racing fan, espcially with a gaming wheel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Queen_Neko/recommended/339790/","Queen_Neko","The Nekomancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Queen_Neko/","63 products in account","First things first, this game is old. 10 years old. Don't come expecting much in the way of graphics, you'll be disappointed. If you want graphics, go for a new sim like Assetto Corsa,\n\nSecond, the base game content sucks. If you don't like modding games, don't buy this game.\n\nThird, this is damned fun. The AI is highly adaptable, I have found. None of the awkwardness of being too fast for one difficulty but too slow for the next one. The modding community is enormous, IE to scales I've only really seen beaten by Bethesda RPGs and FSX. Want F1 cars from 1982? Got that. Want Indycars from 1998? Got that too. Want Argentinian Touring Cars, Australian GT cars, or British Formula 3? It's got all that.\n\nAnd, despite the game being 10 years old, the modding community is still active today. Mods for this year's Formula One cars are being made, Formula E mods exist, and so on.\n\nI can tell you of some of the most fun I've had racing.\n\n2010 V8 Supercars at Zolder. The car/track combo worked ideally, and both of these mods were made by completely different teams.\n\n2011 ALMS at Sebring. Mixed class endurance racing. It's not easy, you have to negotiate through slow cars, and let fast cars through, and while racing another guy. It punishes mistakes, in a predictable way. This isn't F1 2012, it feels great.\n\n2012 Indycar at Nazareth. Close, wheel to wheel racing without any AI derps. I think this is where the AI shows what it can do the most. Despite the high speeds, the AI works very well. No sudden giving up on moves and single file racing, no jumpy over excitement that inevitably leads to a 10 car pile up, it feels (and looks) like a real race.\n\nOverall, I'd give rFactor an 8.5 out of 10. It's fun, but it's not the ultimate racing sim, at least not nowadays. Soon enough, rFactor 2 will come to Steam, and once the modding community starts doing what it does best, lets just say I have high hopes for ISI.\n\n\nUPDATE: Being such an old game, this can be a real pain to configure modern wheels with. I use a ThrustMaster T150, and to set it up you have to change the settings with the wheel completely, and dig into the config files to reconfigure how steering works, and find FFB plugins to make the force feedback feel decent or just exist. These problems don't exist with other, more modern games that use wheels.","October 7, 2015","true","225.1"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","19","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulu_cn/recommended/339790/","zulu_cn","St3fan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zulu_cn/","148 products in account","Conclusion first:\nI recommend rFactor to people who don't mind dated graphics and who know computers pretty well and are fine with all the trouble finding mods all over the internet and installing the mods. Search for some rFactor video on Youtube. If you can't stand the graphics, or if you want a game that has great content out-of-the-box, stay away from rFactor.\n\nAlthough this sim has been out for many years, and it looks dated and starts to show its age in many aspects, and although I started sim racing from Assetto Corsa and Project Cars with much much better graphics, rFactor has taken up more and more of my sim racing time. It is a pretty solid mod platform and a solid sim racing game in general. I would recommend this game to anyone who's not too concerned about graphics and wants a racing sim with lots of contents. In fact on some tracks rFactor on my machine looks better and more impressive than its sequel rF2.\n\nPros:\n1. Lots of mods providing almost anything you want with car racing. Lots of cars and tracks avaiable for download on various websites.\n2. The handling of cars is quite natural. Of course how good a car drives highly depends on the quality of the mod, but generally speaking if you follow other people's suggestions you can get pretty decent experience.\n3. The racing aspect of the game is solid. AI is pretty good providing nice battles, you get endurance features, and you can make your own championship or use what other people have made.\n\nCons:\n1. Very dated look and graphics. It offers day/night transition but it looks pretty bad.\n2. Championship mode feels very basic and there's no added feature to give you extra sense of achievement (such as a splash screen at the end to show the podium etc.).\n3. Your experience with the game highly depends on the quality of mods. In fact I think it depends on the mods way too much. The base content is very very weak.\n4. It is a PITA to find good mods and install them. Sometimes it's very hard to find a working download link because the mod might be old, and it's very hard to keep track of all the versions of the mods. Unlike the convenient rF2 Steam workshop implementation, the rF1 mod sites are very messy. Some mods screws up shared files of the game and breaks other mods, and some mod developers make unnecessary installation executable rather than just a compressed file to deploy their mod.\n5. The road car side of this game is very, very limited. Even you go around the Internet and find all the good road car mods, it still feels very weak. Yes I know there is a Shift Street mod which is NFS Shift series rip-off but nearly all the cars have terrible handling and generally do not feel like the real thing.\n\nMods that I enjoy:\n1. Enduracers' endurance mod. I particularly like the Flat6 series.\n2. HistoX GT and Touring mod. This mod requires you having GT Legends, and the installation guide is convoluted. But as soon as you get it working almost every car is a blast to drive.\n\nI think I'll probably give rFactor something like a 8/10.","March 27","true","26.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

While the cars and tracks you start out with are decent, you can expand your choices by downloading some of the thousands of mods that add cars and tracks. Want to change Ayrton Senna's fate at Imola? Download the F1 1994 mod. Enjoy watching the IZOD IndyCar series and wish you were a driver? There are mods for that. Prefer slower-paced vehicles and touring cars? Plenty of mods for that too. rFactor is a game that is able to be tailored to your tastes by the mods that you download and that sets it apart from other racing games.

Let's start with pros and cons.  It's rFactor-the swiss army knife of sim racing.  Don't like what it does, download something totally different for it and change the game completely.  Admittedly, the ISI content that comes with rFactor is not good when compared to what modders have done with the game.  If you don't download any mods then I'd imagine you'd pretty damn disappointed with rFactor.  If you download some mods, then you're going to enjoy it much more.  Some mods I'd recommend\n-Enduracers\n-Historic Touring Cars\n-Cart Factor\n-V8 Supercars Unleashed\n-Formula E (having a blast with this at the moment)\n-DRM Revival (loud old cars with too much horsepower)\n\nAs for tracks there are hundreds.  Some of my favorites include\n-Any of the Australian tracks (Barbagello, Mt. Panorama, etc)\n-Monza, Nordschleife, Hockenheim, etc\n\nrFactor has great mods and tracks.  It's a lot of fun to try them out.  Sure you'll get some bad ones but you can't go wrong with any of the mods I listed above.  I'm sure there's a few I've left out but I'm sure you'll discover them on your own.  There are still mods being made for this and there's still about 100x as many mods for rFactor 1 as there are for rFactor 2.  At this point, rFactor 1 is  the better buy over rFactor 2 in my eyes.

Want to go racing on the bumpy concrete runways of Sebring? You can get that. But what's Sebring without sportscars? Try the EnduRacers and GTPC mods, and your wish will be granted. Also, many of these mods can be expanded even further (!) with all manner of extra skins, car packs and tracks.\n\nIt's not the best looking game out there, but for something made in 2005, it looks great. Some modders have even given these limitations the middle finger; even on high-mid graphics settings, some of these add-on cars and tracks look absolutely amazing. Also, it's a rare example of a highly-regarded modern game that DOESN'T need a NASA supercomputer to run. My PC is an absolute potato, but it still runs absolutely fine, even with as many as 63 cars on the track at the same time. (Maybe it's powered by GlaDOS technology?)\n\nIf you're looking for a great racing sim that can be easily added to, throw GTR2, Project CARS and Assetto Corsa out the window and get this. You won't regret it.","July 11, 2015","true","780.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And seems to hold up very well mechanically.  Graphicly, below average.  But that shouldn't hold you back.  The issue, as with most older games, is player population.  There is still a very large player base.  But they are split into pockets.  Team of drivers here, racing league there.  The main one I found still running a server is the "BROS Meganes V2" server.  A simple google will find their page, with the mod, and track downloads.\n\nThis takes me to the next point, the game comes with a few racing serieses.  The bulk of the cars come from player made MODs.  Back when the game was in is prime.  Hundreds, if not maybe thousands of racing cars could be found.  From DTM, Souped up racing semi trucks.  Super V8s, Vintage cars, dirt races, and so on, and so on.  Same goes for race tracks.  So many to pick from.\n\nWith rFactor 2 out, most have prolly moved on.

It not worth its price, a 10 year old game for a niche market isnt be this price, SCE is slightly more expensive and is a lot more fleshed out. The so called "next gen" sims like AC and RF2 have features this could only dream of.\n\nId consider this on a sale but in its beaten brutally by the competition currently.","October 18, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","2","13","0","0"

No amount of steering or braking will alter your path, once it decides you were going too fast, it will continue to go in a straight line until you hit something or if there was enough room your speed slowly decreases to almost stopped.
