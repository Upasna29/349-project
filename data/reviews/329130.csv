The idea is not new: design a spaceship, battle other spaceships, mine resources in order to buy ship upgrades, repeat.  But this game stands out for a few reasons.\n\nFirst is the realism of ship design.  You assemble your ship out of a stock of components in a editor reminiscent of Microsoft Visio (but better; MSFT ought to hire this guy).  In most games like this, you might, say, upgrade to Engine IV, which makes you move at speed 8.  In Reassembly, your ship's behavior is instead calculated as a consequence of your design.  Speed, for example, is a result of your thrust and mass, but in addition, maneuverability is a result of where you put your thrusters, how they're angled, your ship's center of gravity (which is indicated in the ship editor), etc.  If your ship doesn't handle the way you like, it's your fault, and you can easily fix it.\n\nSecond is the AI behavior.  All ships seek resources which grow on space rocks.  Lots of small ships hover around these rocks harvesting what they can find; a few medium-size ships prowl around the perimeter hunting the small ships; and occasionally capital ships arrive and destroy everyone.  It feels rather like an ecology simulator, with minnows nibbling at coral reefs, big fish eating the minnows, and so on.  Since the universe is dynamically generated, I assume this 'ecology sim' behavior isn't hard-coded, but is emergent behavior of the ship AI.  Anyway, it makes you feel that you're inhabiting a living world.\n\nIt's beautiful, too, with a minimal color palette standing out against stark black space.  Hundreds of ships can be onscreen at a time without the game apparently breaking a sweat (thanks Reassembly developer, for actually caring about performance).  And the trance-y music complements the minimalist esthetic nicely.\n\nIf you built Lego spaceships as a kid, or you have scuba dived in a coral reef and liked it, you should play this game.","February 24, 2015","true","56.8"," 252 of 258 people (98%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","98","252","258","10","4"

At first, however, I found myself a little lost in this strangely organic world that is somewhere in the far reaches of space.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swxfEZJtZAk\nIt doesn't take long for you to realize that you are not alone, and, in fact, you have a whole faction that shares your own desire for expansion in the untamed universe. Unlike many in this loose genre, you fight side by side with your AI friends from beginning to end.\n\nMake no mistake, this is, at it's core, a block building game, where you build your spaceship, and can build fleets of custom ships to fight with you or just let them loose to go it on thier own. Where they will build more ships of thier own and fight the good fight for the faction gathering resources and growing your empire just like yourself. In many ways, when I play this I feel like just another small, but important, peice of a larger hive doing my part. Although I would like to think that I might contribute a little more than my AI companions, I hope.\n\nIn Reassembly, you will explore, expland, exploit, and exterminate. Yes, this is, in fact, a 4X game, hidden underneath a very well crafted version of a top down space shooter.\n\nThe more I play, the more I want to play, and I find myself losing time.

The kind where it will suck you in for hours if you're not careful. As it is now in its beta phase, some new features are now part of the game. Most notably asynchronous Multiplayer.\n\nThis does not mean players will directly fight other players. Rather, it is still single player in that retrospect. What you do fight, are the ships that other players have spent countless hours, or a few seconds throwing together, in a big mashup found dotted about in the ecosystem.\n\nYou will find many different tactics and build strategies are required to best some of the more difficult enemies, and ultimately, your goal will be universal annihilation!! MWAHAHA!! Or at least that's my goal.\n\nYou can either wander aimlessly, killing everything you see, avoiding everything you see, copying everything, building everything, or just plain sit there while you watch hordes of allied AI ships, drones, and missiles beat the crap out of your foes in shiny balls of explosions!\n\nThere is a relatively small but lively community found on this game's forums, where the Developer himself, Arthur, runs and frequents.\n\nOne more thing! Every few weeks, there are design contests held where players can create ships to blow each other up in a big tournament! Further excitement is based solely on player discrecion.\n\nUpdate! I forgot to mention some stuff\n\nThere are currently over 500 different parts, the player has direct access to about 40 of them. (the others are parts from other factions, of which there are 15)\n\nYou can fly around and kill things, design ships, and collect resources. There isn't much of a story mode, but there is a sandbox where you can spawn any faction and build with every part. (requires a basic level of coding knowledge)\n\nThe ai is incredibly smart. There are ai competitions every few weeks where players build ships to a certain danger level, then submit them to different classes, where they fight to the death round robin style, and the best 16 are pitted in a single elimination bracket for all to see.\nFrom these tournaments, the developer (Arthur) works on tweaking the ai so that it can better fend for itself during battles, leading to more aggressive enemies.\nThe current system of ai smarts has to do with profile tags that are randomly assigned to each ai, some will get a "bad aim" tag, others might have "Reckless" or "runs away", and any combination of tags will eventually result in harder enemies. The hardest so far is one that has tags "smart fire, reckless, dodges, chases"\n\nUpdates are between daily and monthly, it really depends on what's being changed. They are usually just a few megabytes, the game itself is only 160 mb.\n\nThe game runs very well in huge fights. Even with 1k ai (missiles, ships, drones) flying everywhere, there is hardly a noticeable tax on performance. (60 fps is average)\n\nThe balance is relatively good. The learning curve is not too steep, and starting newbies will be challenged to survive. and you will die, even if you try to play defensively, it's bound to happen.","November 25, 2014","true","321.7"," 71 of 78 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","71","78","5","3"

In Reassembly you use materials you find all around you in an area of deep space to upgrade and modify your ship using a number of parts available to you. Reassembly can be enjoyed in three different game modes which I will briefly explain now.\n\nFirst off we have the main game mode (it doesn't have a specific name), in the main game mode you take control of a ship in a huge, procedurally generated, sector of deep space. You start in a friendly area where you can also find other ships who are fighting on your side and can be recruited to join you in battle though they will help you anyway. As you travel through this area of space you will fight enemies from many factions and repair space stations which exchange R (resource points) for C (currency) so that you can purchase upgrades and new parts.\n\nNext we have the tournament mode. Here you can choose any of the ships you have created (or any you have downloaded though I'm not sure where you get them from) and then you watch them go head to head to see which ship is better. The number of ships you select for your tournament effects how many rounds take place and a winner is crowned at the end of each round.\n\nFinally we have the sandbox mode. I'm going to be honest here, I have absolutely no idea what this is, you start with a blank map (apart from some welcoming words) and a text box at the top in which you have to enter lines of code to do something though I couldn't tell you what that something is as I have no idea what kind of code it uses.\n\nUnless I state otherwise the following positives and negatives are for the main game mode.\n\n+Gorgeous, colourful vector graphics\n+The map is procedurally generated for each save slot so you can never play the same game twice\n+When your ship is damaged it takes parts of debris from surrounding space to repair itself and watching parts of your ship get repaired is really quite cool\n+You aren't alone in your mission, you always have a faction of ships who are friendly and can be recruited into your fleet\n+Once you get the hang of it (I'll come to that later) the building system this game has allows you to create really cool things and if you gradually add things, piece by piece, it's possible to make great things even if you aren't particularly creative\n+Lots of different enemy factions, enemy factions fight each other as well as your faction\n+Different factions have very different ship designs and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses\n+When you are destroyed you spawn at a nearby, friendly space station\n+The universe feels alive as you frequently come across battles between enemy factions\n+Watching two ships fight in the tournament mode is really cool and quite relaxing since you aren't in control\n+You have nine save slots to play around with\n+Great soundtrack though it does get repititive after a while\n+Good sound effects\n\n+/-Reassembly has wormholes which allow your ships to travel into other players' game and vice versa which is a great idea, sady it is executed poorly. This mechanic puts the game's balance six feet under as you frequently find yourself facing ships thousands of times more powerful than your own early on in the game which of course you stand absolutely no chance against\n\n-Nothing in the game is explained to the player apart from a couple of basics at the beginning, you're left to figure out things like building and the upgrade system all by yourself\n-Reassembly requires a lot of grinding, especially early on. I found myself going around destroying asteroids and small ships just to get enough R and C to unlock new parts so that I actually stood a chance against small ships at which point the cycle resets and grinding begins again\n-The controls take a lot of getting used to and 4 hours in I'm still struggling with them\n-There seems to be a lot of unnecessary drifting, even when you respawn you instantly start drifting in seemingly random directions\n-The Sanbox mode is not explained at all and doesn't look overly user friendly\n-I feel like it's really missing Steam Workshop intergration, being able to share ships easily would make the tournament game mode much more fun\n-As far as I can tell there is no overall objective apart from destroying ships to make your own more powerful\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nA good 2D space building game with a lot of potential and a rich universe which is let down by its current lack of instruction and the amount of grinding.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nEl K.","March 15, 2015","true","4.1"," 86 of 104 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","86","104","3","0"

It's based around the concept of being able to both design and pilot a ship to conquer the galaxy with (perhaps with the help of your homegrown fleet). There are tons of options/possibilities, and that's incredibly exciting.\n\nTL;DR-Amazing game, would be the best game ever created if it weren't for the disgusting pile of bugs/glitches.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons I would recommend this game despite the issues I'll comment on farther down.\n-When you get hit somewhere your health bar doesn't drop, you lose that part of your ship. Your thrusters got blown off and your only weapon faces forward? Sucks.\n-Every faction truly plays differently. It's not a game of "What weapons am I gonna rambo with this time?" It's more like "These are my options, now what am I going to do with them?"\n-The physics are great and really consider a lot of important factors such as center of mass and thruster location.\n-The music is astounding. Gives a nice space-y feel and also compliments the actual gameplay quite well.\n-Buildup from small to large ships doesn't feel grind-y and boring. It's just a different phase of the game, where instead of taking on giant death machines you go around activating stations and collecting resources from easier sources.\n-Ships made by other players spawn in your world, so you get a lot of variety.\n-The graphics are great. Frankly, I'm sick of repeated textures and copied/pasted environments. The basis on particles makes each game experience unique both visually and in regards to gameplay.\n\n\nHowever, this game feels like it never left alpha/beta phase. There are insane numbers of holes in regards to instructions/development. A minor example (that still bugs me quite a bit) is part tool-tipping. Many have descriptions while even more have no real explanation whatsoever.  The number of typos is also embarrassing.\nThe number of general options is also a joke. Why do I have to turn autozoom off every time I start the game? And why do I have to deal with that stupid tutorial every time I start a new file? There's no skip option! And don't even get me started on those quests that never go away (why should I have to minimize the HUD just to sweep the pathetic tutorial under the rug?)\n\nThe biggest issue has got to be the bugs, though. So. Many. Bugs.\n-The game crashes frequently during ship construction or even just flying around. Or sometimes it will freeze for 2 or 3 minutes just 'cause.\n-Sometimes I catch allied ships desperately trying to kill themselves on asteroids. I mean, just slamming into them and then keeping thrusters full speed ahead until they finally explode.\n-Sometimes the above happens to me and gives me no control over it. Even if I'm holding "X" to stop the freaking ship.\n-Lag lag lag. I know this is a particle-based game, but come on. Going through Spiky Plant territory means sending the game into slow motion (about 1/2 time, maybe slower).\n-Weird glitches regarding exploring. Sometimes my territory goes from my ownership to "unexplored" or no-ownership unexpectedly. Even if I'm sitting in the middle of that territory with a few stations and a fleet of 50 ships. There are other similar glitches, such as arrows pointing to stations that don't exist.\n-Lots of glitchiness surrounding drones/missiles. Particularly during ship construction. Sometimes the parts just do really weird things like spawn a missile inside of the ship, which leads to all kinds of glitchiness. I once had a ship I was working on explode into a few pieces IN THE EDITOR because of a stray missile.\n\nThere are a few non-bug-related issues with the game IMO, but those are actually pretty minor. Compared to the bug issues, I often forget they're even issues at all.\nI could go on and on about all the glitches in this game. It's insane and needs to be addressed more immediately. I love this game for the ideas/concepts and gameplay. It's really fun and has a lot of awesome mechanics. The brilliance and creativity that went into making this work of art are just enough to overlook the pile of crap that is the coding/attention-to-detail.","July 30, 2015","true","90.1"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","39","40","3","2"

Heroin. Nicotine. Alchohol. Reassembly. What do these things have in common? They're all highly addictive. With that being said, Reassembly deffinately has it's faults, but if their's something that interests you about this game, then it's probly worth checking out.\n\nLong Version:\n\nReassembly is a 2d, top down, vector graphic space shooter that lets you build your own fleet to conquer the galaxy with. You start out the game with a few premade ships to select from, a faction that looks just like you, and a galaxy full of things that want to kill you. Your objectives are to capture space stations, gather raw resources, turn them into your faction for credits, use those credits to research new parts and upgrade the power of your ship. The further into the galaxy you go, the harder it gets. Whilst exterminating all life that isn't allied to you from the galaxy, you use the very easy to use ship builder to customize or build from scratch both your ship, and your allied ships. (They either automatically spawn based on designs from your inventory, or are spawned by you from a factory ship.) When designing a ship, you can also elect to 'test' your ship in a series of 1v1 ai controlled deathmatches, exactly like the anisoptera contests.\n\nThen there's the asynchronus multiplayer, this game's greatest feature, and biggest pitfall. Essentially, ships that other players have designed will be found strewn throughout the galaxy, in their own factions. Typically, these factions are far stronger than any of the vanilla factions you will encounter, however, that's not true of all of them. For example, one user created a troll ship in the sandbox mode, which allows ship designs that aren't legal in the normal game mode. Only now, here's that ship in _my_ normal game mode. I have a problem with that. Further compounding this problem, are the contest ships. Those ships are purpose built to fall into a specific category of ship, and dominate anything with the same power level or below. Sounds about right, doesn't it? I mean, isn't that the whole point of the contest, and ship design in general? The problem is, you're playing a game that isn't a 1v1 deathmatch. You need storage tanks for your raw resources, factories to spawn your death fleet, and just in general use components that take up space that could be used for more killing devices, or maneuverability. For example, one ship I came across was designed to ram into you, shove a ton of armor between you and his control module, while having 6 plasma cannons on these fragile little arms. The idea being, there's no way for you to chew through his armor before those untouched cannons melt your entire ship. This works great in those ai controlled deathmatches, however it's completely useless in the main game. I'd like to see all sandbox ships blocked from the main game, as well as a user set flag in the designer for "competition mode" or some such, where any ships that have that flag aren't used for the main game.\n\nI've come across few other issues, like occasionally getting stuck in other objects when changing your ship (solved with a relog) and minor bugs.\n\nAn early access game, and my complaints are fairly minor in nature? Why are you still reading? Go forth and buy immediately! ;)","December 18, 2014","true","20.4"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","37","38","9","0"

That's split between playing the singleplayer, building ships for tournaments, watching my ships compete in tournaments, and sharing and battling ships with friends.\n\nThis is, in all honesty, one of the best space-ship games I've ever played. The game itself is built on very simple components: simple physics, simple graphics, and simple 2-D exploration. However, it is the way these parts fit together under the fantastic music and brilliant vector-based combat that just draw you in. Very immersive, very fun, very addicting, and by far the best ship builder in any space game I've ever played. The ship builder and sharing tools are really the highlights of the game.\n\nWhat there is to do:\n-Build ships from scratch\n-Fly ships in open 2D space\n-explore procedurally generated content (As with all games that rely on procedurally generated content, the wow factor goes away pretty fast. Thankfully, this isn't what the game relies on to stay fun)\n-Unlock new ship pieces and build better ships out of the scrap of your defeated foes.\n-Build a factory and begin constructing a fleet\n- Battle fleets made by other players at hotly contested wormholes (There is no multiplayer, but the AI is VERY good and it pilots the fleets that players themselves upload. It priotizes the fleets made by steam friends)\n-Enter the wormhole to upload your fleet\n-share ship.lua files with friends and pit them in 1v1 battle in tournament mode to see who can make the best ship.\n-7 playable factions\n\nThat's about it. One last note, it seems that the developer is pretty much done with the game. There haven't been any major patches since the launch and the forum activity has died down quite a bit, but I believe the last thing that's being set up for this game is compatibility with steam workshop so that all future content will come from the game's players rather than the devs.","June 15, 2015","true","144.1"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","5"

Another faction has incredibly low armour/health, but has the highest damaging weapons. You unlock the other factions by killing large valuable ships of that faction, once you kill a certain amount, or a certain value of ship, You unlock that faction to play as.\n\nShips are assigned value based on their size, So for instance, if your build cap is 500P, and you build a ship up to say, 460P, your ship is worth 460P. Most factions will cap out at 8,000P, and it will take some time to get there.\n\nInside each map, There are usually around 8-10 "Agents" Agents being player fleets spawning in your world, They can range from being total garbage, to an impossible force. Each time you go through a Wormhole, the way you change maps, It will spawn your current fleet setup randomly in other players worlds.\n\nThe gameplay is very nice, It plays like a twin stick shooter and it works. The game itself is very well optimized, even after spawning around 150 large ships it still ran smoothly and at a decent framerate. The graphics are nice and stylized.\n\nI really have nothing negative to say about this game, It's just amazing.\n\nWith 22 hours in the game, I've managed to completely clear only 2 of the 7 Factions, By that I mean, unlocking all the parts, upgrading the build cap to max and building a very powerful ship.

Simple to understand, difficult to master. But then you try to upgrade your ship and its like WOAH wtf is all this......its......its freedom! You can build pretty much anything in this! Add the mods to it and you go past even that. My personal experience has seen me build a ship so weak a flower that I hit killed me, yet with this ship I managed to control a fleet so large I beat every faction on the map! Another ship I built spins so fast that the collision damage from its extremities is so high I can fly straight THROUGH asteroids as if its butter. Another ship has arms that cuddle my enemies to death.......it goes on.\n\nYou will play this game for a few hours then put it down, then suddenly some idea will pop into your head and back you are again for more hectic mayhem as you try to build your awesome idea! A brilliant game all round, design, artwork, playability and even very good controls systems for all manner and type of ship you could build.","September 11, 2015","true","84.3"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","38","44","7","1"

(They're both freeware so go try them if you're interested in this.) It takes the concepts of both, and throws in a bit of Starsector (namely the fleet mechanics) for good measure to make a game I've poured hours into already. (As of writing, I've played it for 10.8 hours. I bought it yesterday.)\n\nWhile some have also compared it to Gimbal, I'd say only at the very start. The comparison starts losing ground once you get the bigger ships.\n\nWhere this stands out is the.. well, game. BF and CF are both fun for a short play, but don't have many backing gameplay mechanics. Reassembly gives you economies, waring fations, fleet control and quite a bit of variety (Though I'd like to see mod support in the future for even more pieces/factions). Each faction also plays differently in various ways, for example, one can plant and grow their own resources, but seem to be lacking in firepower, another has literal nukes, but no shields, and so on, it forces a change in tactics when it comes to ship design that keeps things fresh. With all that in mind, it's still a sandbox, outside of the tutorial, what you do is purely up to you with zero guidance, I personally like that, some might not.\n\nIt should also be noted it seems to run superbly. I have a fairly powerful machine, but any game with 1000s of ships/particles will slow it down some. This doesn't, I've had fleets of hundreds of ships facing off against each other, and it has stayed at a stable 60fps.\n\nAll in all, one of the best games I've purchased in a very long time.\n\nEDIT: Apparently mod support is already somewhat in the game.

The game is exactly the same as it was when it came out on Steam, with the only major addition being a "tournament" mode where you plop a couple ships into a ladder to see which one wins out.\n\nThe aesthetic is interesting, but ultimately the actual game is shallow.  Most of the gameplay comes from designing your ship and seeing how it fares in combat, but the combat is doesn't have strategic depth other than ramming or kiting.  Your design slowly moves away from what you'd call an actual spaceship and more towards a geometric shape with internal engines.  A basic square filled with as many weapons and shields as possible is simply better than trying to create anything that's actually interesting.  Ship combat, therefore, devolves into a blob of shields mounted on a square careening through space and slamming into other blobs of shields in an orgy of lasers and missiles.  It looks nice, but carefully designing a ship isn't worth the effort.\n\nThe design system is simple and easy to understand, but in practice it just falls flat.\n\nThe "living world" is also not really what you'd expect.  Capturing territory across the galaxy becomes an exercise in Exterminatus from Warhammer 40,000.  You bring as many ships as possible and cleanse every single enemy ship from an area of the map, which then switches colour to your faction.  That's it.  You don't get any resources, your own ships don't start to spawn there, not even a message appears on screen.  A part of the map changes colour, and you move on to the next area.  Eventually this devolves into chasing one tiny little gnat of a ship that can't even hurt you across your territory because it keeps reclaiming tiles.  It's tedious.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I liked this game, but it is very shallow and the replayability just isn't there.","May 20, 2015","false","43.8"," 163 of 252 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","163","252","10","8"

The ship designing system and balance is brilliant, as is the economy and ship-reproduction system.  Good for about 40 hours of intense gaming.

In my opinion, the other races and the "clean out the entire universe" tasks aren't as compelling as the development of increasingly complex and dangerous ships as you "level up".

You collect resources.  You upgrade your blueprints and your "power level" to build bigger, better ships.\n\nEventually you can build "factories" on your ships, which allow your ships to produce even more ships.

Looking at my stats it says: 51 products, 1 review, 1400+ hours; I know what you're thinking... DO NOT CALL 911, I have assuredly not been taken hostage by this game. I just happened to leave the program running 24/7 every now and then. There is totally nothing to worry about (please don't judge me!)...\n\nI have found that most of this game's replayability lies in (1) - creating and enjoying the diverse player-created mods and (2) - pitting ship designs against each other in competitions amongst friends as a frantic cry for help\n\nMods are incredibly easy to work with (using and creating) and can be downloaded or turned on/off with minimal hassle.

I enjoyed Captain Forever, Battleships Forever, Gimbal,  as well as Stardrive 2. I have no idea how I didn't find out about it until now.\n\nI think Reassembly takes the great construction and space combat elements of all those games and puts it in one solid package. I was surprised to see it run smoothly during heavy action (unlike Stardrive), In its category, the decent amount of gameplay depth and accessibility help make this one a top tier 2D-space-builder-shooter.

In this case it's crazy custom ship skirmishes.\nTarget of the game is pretty simple - conquer the whole map. And all you have to accomplish that is you own ship, some raw resources and a couple of supporting space stations.\nYou have to farm (literally, they grow on space plants) resources, fight enemies, build your fleet and slowly proceed to the center of the map. That's a game in a nutshell. But, I want to stress this once more, the game does this one thing very VERY good.\nAdd here a nice async multiplayer - all players can share their ship builds online, and those shared ships will appear in other players' games. Which is pretty awesome if ask me.\nBut is it enough? Well, that's for you to decide. If you ask me - it definitely is.\nOh, and don't forget the amazing soundtrack!\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG-RP0yBg8M","November 30, 2014","true","5.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

For those who love to be creative, this game is a must-get.\n\nPROS:\n+ Full customization of ships and stations, shape by shape. This is a huge plus for those who love to build things from the ground-up.\n+ Ship building is very well structured and stable. Rarely are there frustrating moments where blocks don't do what I want.\n+ Semi-open world (the world loops, but you can travel to new maps too.)\n+ Nice graphics & well-built. Nothing too fancy, but still fitting. This game isn't too demanding in general, in terms of hardware.\n+ Easy to get the hang of. It doesn't take too long to figure things out.\n+ Forgiving gameplay. If you die, you lose all your resources that you were carrying, but if you're nearby enough, you might be able to rush back to pick it up.\nCONS:\n- Frustrating at times. There will be times when you have those "BS" moments, and indeed, it gets rather annoying sometimes.\n- Trial-by-fire learning curve. I advise against going to the center of the map until you're at max build limit...\n- Full customization.

It looks like a RTS, but plays like a 2D action game. It gives you the feeling of an ant in an anthill, fighting against the minions of other swarms. But also you grow and evolve and start to get your own swarm, that follows you.\nAll in all, beside being a space shooter, it really has some organic feeling. It also could be on the bottom of the ocean. Or maybe small microorganisms.\n\nYour ship is made of different shaped geometric objects. Hull parts, interior and weapons. Zoomed out, they give surprisingly good looking shapes. After you design your first ship, you are thrown in a crazy living 2D world, where everything tries to kill you, that has a different color than you. This isnt always user friendly. Flying too early too far out of your territory you face enemys, that are 10 times the size of you. While you explore, you unlock commando points, that give you new weapons or upgrading your ship to be able to use more parts to be bigger. Also your surroundings generate ressources. Everyone is gathering them. If you kill an enemy, he will drop his ressources, if you die, they will also loot you. You can turn in those ressources on allied bases to get more commando points, also that station will generate new allied ships. That way, every faction on the map is constantly growing at attacking the borders of the other faction.\nAs the game continues, you will find more and more ressources, unlock new weapons, until you are that big, that you stop selling your ressources but generating your own minions, that follow you. If they are big enough and have a factory, they also will be able to gather ressources and build ships.\nIf you are bored with your universe, you take your fleet and go to a new one (reset the game, like a new game+).\n\nEvery enemy faction has unique weapons, buildings, ships and tactics. Some of them can be really annoying, most of them are playable, after you once defeated them.\n\nWhile working perfectly (I only had one massive crash), the game has a lot of flaws that bug me:\n- there is no real war: The world only moves around you. If you arent present, the areas arent loaded. That way, you only have the illusion of a living world, but the only acting thing is you.\n- enemy AI is korean like, allied AI is on drugs: Having some maxed out follower ships, then seeing them flying into an enemy fleet like idiots and dying like idiots makes you question the game. Seeing the enemy flying player designed ships better than the player is capable of, makes you rage a lot. It is no fun fighting the AI. They will dash forward, attack you and retreat like cowards, when you fire back. That way, a lot of small ships are capable of slowly poking you to death. If you manage to hit them, they will run away, like on crack, never giving you the chance of actually destroy and loot them. Some ships, even split in half and totally destroyed managed to escape me with 1 or 2 remaining thrusters and the commando bridge. A strong AI is cool and challenging. A perfect AI, that plays safe and never do mistakes is frustrating. A lot! Its not about them being OP, its about them always fleeing a fight.\n- Charging my lazerz: directed beam weapons > everything. You can defeat 90% of the map by using massive amounts of the charge beam laser. Then put it on point defence. Then laugh like an idiot watching those skirmishing ships flying towards you to do their stupid hit and run, seeing them exploding because your point defence automatically targets and destroy them. Your other weapons will be massive amounts of plasma cannon to melt down everything that cant move away, or, if you like it with more precision, gaus rifles to shoot those poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s without them even knowing from where you hit them.\n- After reaching max size, the game is over. There is nothing to do. Even the big ships, that chased you in the beginning, are small fishes now. I even managed to cut one of them in half with a single salve of gaus shots. Since you have the lasers, you dont have to care about the small ones ether. Simply ignore them. They will come in weapon range, then explode.\n- If you are bad at designing and crafting games, just dont.\n\nReassembly is not a decent game, it is an awesome game! But has major problems with balancing, AI, mapping and simply has no endgame.","March 1, 2015","true","60.3"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

Your aim in this game was to swim around in the ocean and eat any of the fish small enough to fit in your mouth and then hall ♥♥♥ away from fishes that were large enough to eat you in one go.\n\nThat is a game i feel thay Reassembly can quite easily be compared to. You start off with a small array of 'stock' ships, provided by the dev team to get you started. These are your small fish. As the game provides you with tutorial messages and objectives you will fail at killing a couple of ships as you get used to the aiming and flying mechanics and you will find that if the ship is smaller than yours... It blows up. The moment you see a ship that consists of a number of blocks higher than yours. Run. Or more likely get blown up and respawn.\n\nBut as you kill the little ships and gather your resource, convert it into C and then purchase upgrades or convert it into P. Your ship begins to grow. You test out designs but eventually you realise as long as you make it big and fast and cover it in as many guns you can hide beneath shields... You're doing the a good job. Your ship begins to get larger... You can kill larger ships... Your ship gets larger still. You begin ignoring the smaller craft you once relied on for resources as they are just a minor neusance to you. You feel like a God amongst the stars. Then a Scythe ship one shots you and you start farming those little guys again just to boost your ego back up.\n\nGreat game, very long review.

The game is brilliantly executed, if perhaps still limited, but then I haven't beaten the game yet. The exploration draws you in in a way that I was utterly surprised by. Since the first day of exploring this title, I have been eager to resume it, to stretch my ship building talents, to bring vengeance to the evil red ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who always seem to be one step ahead.\n\nThe music is nothing short of masterful. Most of the time I tire of the music and mute it in favor of my normal playlists, but the soundtrack is so beautifully atmospheric that there is no need.\n\nNow let's speak of the elephant in the room, a two headed monstrosity. The first head is the game's graphics. From it's trailer, you have accurately seen the game's aesthetics, and they are indeed simple. Then, you have the $40 price tag, a cost very near a AAA title. I showed this game to a roommate who immediately got sucked in, but when he saw the price, said, "Well, maybe I'll get it if it goes on sale."\n\nTake a look at this game's reviews thus far. It scarcely has more than 30, but EVERY SINGLE ONE of them is positive. I have never seen a 100% approval rating on steam. I take from this two things: For those with the means, you WILL enjoy this title. I guarantee it. Two: It is beyond what most people would reasonably expect to pay.\n\nFor a delivery system that has no manufacturing, little overhead, and still in early access, $40 seems steep. It is my opinion that if that price were to get cut in half, its sales would SKYROCKET, by much more than double.\n\nThat being said, with EVERYTHING that I said, this game is WORTH the forty dollars.","December 7, 2014","true","10.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","3"

Once you either get a friend to explain it to you or re-read all texts a few times, you'll get what the different terms mean, get used to them and be able to work with them.\n\nWhile I imagined the gameplay to get repetitive at some time, it actually stayed incredibly fresh and fun for all this time. You keep getting new ideas on what to do, new things to try out, you can keep expanding and if all's boring, just start a new game in a different faction, changing up the gameplay a TON.\n\nThe other thing is: you NEED a good upload speed to play this game, because once you close it, it has to sync about 20MB of data (the world and ships) to the Steam Cloud, stopping you from playing other games during that time, and is just plain annoying. The even worse bit is that DISABLING Steam Cloud syncing seems to erase all ships you've created (it at least happened for me, not sure if that's exactly the cause), so you gotta deal with it somehow...\n\nEITHER WAY, this game is so damn awesome, please go play it, I'll tell ya, once you get used to the mechanics, it'll be an enormous time sink!","February 23, 2015","true","11.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Well, now you can do it for real, on a game that actually creates the battles for you (Imagination is overrated). With no true plot (You are part of a faction, you battle every other faction. That's basically it.) and no central objective, Reassembly is just pure fun. You design your ship with parts that actually have a significant impact in how your ship moves, fires and defends, and you battle other ships, some even designed by other people.\n\nI had a blast playing this game, and spent my whole day experimenting with different weapons and factions, balancing my fleet, spending credits to make my ship bigger and bigger, and dying because my ship was too fast and bumped against a wall, causing instant explotions.

All turrets have the ability to turn 360 degrees, making ship design as simple as slapping as many guns into an armored ball.\n3. Engines can be inside your ship, meaning there is no way to damage them without first destroying the components around them.\nI love how the building works, but I feel like there's still a lot of balancing that needs to be done, since the meta just dictates blobbing up as many guns as you can fit with either:\na. ♥♥♥♥♥ons of armor (which is entirely free most of the time, so you could make a massive armored box at the very beginning)\nb. ♥♥♥♥♥ons of engines, making you pretty much impossible to hit with anything but lasers (although the speed is best put into use by the AI controlled ships, since they can instantly dodge out of the way of almost any attack)\n\nI love this game, but I hope it gets the things I mentioned.\n\nEdit: I just also need to add that the only part of your ship that the AI shoots is your core, so it is optimal to leave extruding parts of your ship unarmored...","February 10","true","58.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","3"

As you blow up enemy ships and explore you can choose to increase the limit of how big your ship can be and/or unlock more powerful components. You start on the edge of the galaxy where it's relatively safe, as you explore towards the center the enemies become bigger and way more powerful.\n\nThere are wormholes you can fly into. These will either take you to a fresh galaxy or send an AI controlled copy of your ship to other player's galaxies. My goal is not only to take over my own galaxy but be the bane of other galaxies as well :)\n\nThe "ecosystem" in Reassembly reminds me of microscopic organisms growing, reproducing, fighting and dying... but IN SPACE!\n\nThe Early Access is $30, which might seem high but I gladly chipped in more than that in the Kickstarter because I want to support what they are doing. If that's too rich for your blood just put it on the WIsh List until the game is actually released.\n\nIf you like Geometry Wars, Minecraft and/or Kerbal Space Program you will very likely dig this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/329130/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Creativity in video games has always been a standard. How do you beat this next boss? How do you navigate past this obstacle? In the past, the solution usually had a few different answers, but today the answers offered really do seem endless. Reassembly demostrates this by placing you in a gigantic galactic sandbox. You will start as the little fish, and work your way into becoming a devastating war-machine. Do you prefer anti-matter cannons, or a nice simple plasma beam? Maybe you will swarm the enemies with missiles and drones. Maybe even all of the above! Eventually you will also get the opportunity to design and produce your own fleet with a factory attachment. Each ship can be given a “child order” in which they will spawn their own new ships as long as they too have a factory attached. A war-machine and a loving mother? Oh the duality of man… Er, woman… Err… Spaceship. This isn’t going well. Anyways, let’s take a closer look at Reassembly.\n\nUpon killing an enemy ship you will start to gain “R” or resources, which can then be traded in for “C” (currency). The currency is then used to buy new parts that can be used in any new ship design, this means you will probably redesign your ships fairly regularly to keep up with the latest, greatest weapons in attempts to conquer bigger threats. Your mothership has a “P” limit, I assume P is for power, which can be upgraded with the currency. The power limit of any ship designs constructed will translate to the resource cost once you eventually unlock the factory. While the basics can take a while to master due to the needlessly abbreviated names, eventually your mother-ship will be ready to take on anything. You will scoot around repairing damaged stations, which are actually destroyed by your enemies in real time! There are 7 factions, which means 6 different races to destroy! While you might enjoy feeding on their little guys, stay on your guard because there is almost always a bigger fish. Then again, it might be worth the risk because destroying one of the gigantic capital ships among their allied swarm is extremely thrilling!\n\nMaintaining control of an entire galaxy is tough work though, and opposing factions aren’t the only ones out to ruin your rampage. Agent fleets, which are created and uploaded by other users (via wormholes) will relentlessly hunt down and destroy your spawning stations. When you finally find your way back to try and repair it, prepare for one hell of a fight. Flight and weapons are wonderfully dynamic, both in combat and out. Navigating an asteroid field takes a lot of foresight, unless you just have a set of lasers mounted to burn through anything that gets in your way. Some weapons are able to follow your cursor, while others are mounted firmly to the ship. Finding the best combination for your race, fleet, and strategy is absolutely imperative. Each of the seven races offers a completely unique set of parts for their ships so even after you’ve cleaned up the galaxy as one team, there is still tons of incentive to go back and try the others. The AI is pretty intelligent as well. You won’t see a drone ship (yours or the enemy’s) rush into the fray, and even the combat fighters know when it’s time to retreat.\n\nThere is very little criticism I’m able to find for Reassembly. It does lack a story, and the level generation seems completely random which doesn’t lead to much strategy regarding which colored enemies to go after until later in the game when territories have more or less been established. Overall, I found Reassembly to be an endlessly replayable treat, with a learning curve much higher than one would perceive at first glance. There are so many little touches that put this game over the top, such as the ship building battle simulator, in which you can test your newly constructed ship against enemies of around the same cost. This helps immensely with knowing how the AI will handle the many ships you spawn for it. Paired with the amazing construction, and as many galaxies as there are wormholes to crawl through (read: ENDLESS) this game is a fantastic indie gem that has truly blessed my library. Big thanks to Anisoptera Games and Indie Voyage for the review copy, this game is a jump away from absolute perfection.

If you enjoy ship builder games this game has a decent amount of options to do so. However, if you like in depth ship builders, Reassembly isn't a complex ship building simulator.\n\nEssentially the game amounts to getting resources, selling resources, and building bigger ships. There is an "Agent" mechanic which spawns other player made groups into your galaxy. Many of these squadrons will crush you until you can get to the very end game. These squadrons are really the only threat when you're powerful enough, so you either can leave them on and be demolished repeatedly until the end game, or turn them off and have a very boring end game.\n\nIt doesn't take long to get to the end game, and it's easy to run out of stuff to do. The best way to fight is to stack on piles of armor (it has no point value, so you can have as much as you'd like depending on how slow you don't mind your ship to be) and piling on a ton of a single effective weapon (most races have one or two weapons that are extremely effective, and a pile of flavor weapons which are functional against the standard ships, but not overly so against agents).\n\nAll in all it's a strangely balanced game, but I've had fun playing it. I'd say it's worth the price tag attached to it. If you need a ship builder simulator which has a lot of action but not a lot of depth, try Reassembly.","September 7, 2015","true","19.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

That makes you care about your creations much more than you would have in a purely single player game.\n\nAll in all highly recommended if you like 2D space shooters and building games.","February 21, 2015","true","17.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

I bought it, even though $30 is quite a steep price for a game of this size, but for the most part it was worth it. Ever since I bought it the Dev has been active in updating the game and has made some major improvements on the ai and visuals as a whole. I think one of the latest updates that gave the ships and stations a glow based on their color added even more to the game's beauty. I love the idea of being able to design my own ships and take over the galaxy. Not to mention getting to see other people's creations (and getting to blow them to ****ing pieces).\n\nBut this game does start to get old after a certain point. At the moment there are 7 factions, and I've been able to get to the endgame of just about each one of them, but after you do that.... there's nothing really to do. You conquer one galaxy, move on to the next, and do the same exact thing, and the hardest ships sadly are always the same, (the blue and pinkish purple ones) which are located in the middle, which sadly never changes. Faction balancing is also a problem right now. The red faction atm is completly useless and almost impossible to get anywhere. The blocks it has are far weaker than any other faction (other than its weapons, which do pack a punch) and its ships get completely destroyed almost instantly when you're in the starting stage with the faction. Even when you start creating bigger ships with them they get crushed by other factions who have far better blocks. That brings me to my next point, the lack of options when it comes to blocks for some factions. For example, a faction like the green race (the 2nd option in the menu) has 47 different blocks, whereas some of the others will only have a little over 20 (and are very limited when it comes to weapon variance).\n\nAnother thing that should have been in this game but is not is multiplayer. Sure there's going to be tournaments where you can pit your ships against other ships, but only with the ai using your ship instead of you... If I created a ship to my liking, I want to use that ship to my liking in a pvp environment. Sadly the Dev said that this is probably not going to happen beacuse he'd have to take the game apart to implement a multiplayer function. So if you're going into this game thinking that that's going to be an option. It's most likely not going to happen.\n\nOverall, this game is very fun and I would definatley reccomend buying it, but wait until after it comes out this coming thursday (the 19th) because it's going to be going down to $15 I believe. The creativity in this game is nearly endless, and many good times can be had, but unfortunetly you won't beable to do this with friends in the same galaxy and once you do conquer that galaxy, it's going to get repetetive.\n\nI'd give it an 8/10. Pick it up and enjoy it if you want a creative experience in the sci-fi world.","February 15, 2015","true","50.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I am not someone who enjoys overly complex "X" (ships, mechs, etc.) builders and I'm pleased to report that designing my own ship in this game was incredibly easy.  Essentially, you'll start off with a small ship, earn credits and raw resources, and then build up both your ship and faction in an attempt to get to the center of the map (the difficulty increases as you go, like in "Spore").\n\nIt's a bit pricey for the content it currently offers, though to be fair, the price listed now is actually higher than what it'll be at launch.  This was intended so as to "ensure a higher degree of focus between us and our testers/players."  Those who really enjoy games of this type and don't mind the aspect of Beta testing and playing Early Access games would be best suited to pick this up.

Heck, there aren't even any textures, but i must say, Reassembly has quickly become one of my favorite steam games of all time.\n\nThe main focus of the game is collecting resources from space plants (which seem to grow on anything that isn't constantly flying at full speed) and ships that belong to enemy factions. These resources can then be sold to friendly stations, who will not only give you credits, but also use the collected resources to build friendly ships, who in turn also collect resources to continue the cycle. Other than the initial ships in the world when you start the game, every ship, turret, and station must be spawned in from a factory (which is attached to another ship, turret, or station) when said factory has enough resources to build. All ships, plants, and debris are persistantly exsistant in the world, even when you leave the area. I cannot express in words how tantalizing the very idea of such a vast yet simple cycle is. Fortunantly, I CAN say (and with absolute certainty) that you MUST buy this game!\n\nPS: The dev team is actually active, so don't be scared of the "early access" label.\n\n","January 15, 2015","true","87.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Every single aspect of the ship is COMPLETELY up to you, as you build your ship (and soon) fleet; not just build, but evolve.\n\nAt first, you might get lost real easily by how the game starts out, dropping you in the middle of the game, letting you get your hands in the thick of it with no real instruction. EXPERIMENT! This game is literally endless, with no real, true penalties to stop you from doing whatever you want. From a few simple polygons, you clump it together slowly, piece by piece, and learn what YOU enjoy, and find to work, and improve off it. Not only that, but this game can conform to the way you wish to play easily, so there is NEVER any one, right way to play.\n\nWish to go in hard and heavy, with a giant, bulk-head cruiser? Go ahead, and charge at enemies with a hailstorm of laser beams. Or stay it safe, and strafe your enemies and snipe from afar with powerful missles and energy shots to obliterate the enemy.

Let me start with the basics: Reassembly is an action oriented spaceship building game. Created by Anisoptera Games, an independent studio based in Los Angeles. Mainly inspirited in Lego and insect behavior in a world where everything is modular.\n\nReassembly\n\nYou start to build your very own ship piece by piece (ships are assigned a specific value based on their size) and most of the factions will cap out at 8,000P. Obviously it will take some time to get there ;). There are 7 factions in this universe and all of them play and work differently (insectoid, angley, squarish, plantlike or cristal like are some examples). One faction prioritizes high damage while other will get armor mostly. All of them have specific tactics and this will impact in their weapon choices.\n\nYou can also unlock most of the factions by killing large and valuable ships aligned to them. Once you destroy an specific amount (or, in other words, you make that faction lose an specific amount of value), you unlock that faction to play with.\n\nCombat\n\nWield a wide variety of projectile and beam weapons, missiles, rockets and torpedoes, drones, and more against your enemies. Defend yourself with shields, armor, point defense systems, and pure maneuverability. The combat is a mix of skill, tactics, and preparation – an expertly piloted fighter can take down an enemy fleet, but having a well balanced arsenal helps. I can’t explain this better.\n\nArt & environment\n\nMaps are beautiful and the music flows with it. Procedural generated open living worlds where each faction fight for survival and evolution travelling though wormholes. There are usually a lot of “agents” (player fleets) spawning in the universe defending the sectors and spaceships, in Command mode you can pay them to join your fleet and seek you places to emerge. You need to conquer specifics zones to make spaceships emerge or grow your bases. But be careful, the big enemy fleet is looking these places to destroy them. Scavenge for resources, investigate disturbances, self repair, reproduce and take your fleet to the next stage.\n\nReassembly Reassembly\nReassembly Reassembly\nReassembly\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAI is incredible. When you have a decent fleet of spaceships including your mother♥♥♥♥ing leadership… YOU WILL DIE… A LOT. AI ships can retreat if overwhelmed because they know how to measure the incoming attack. You need to plan how to attack and how to approach the battle and maybe take advantage of impromptu battles between rival factions to recover objectives, or run away after your opponent calls in reinforcements. In screen there can be around 150 ships in crossfire (it will run smoothly and at a decent framerate if you have nice hardware, otherwise you will be laggy).\n\nYou can only target 1 enemy at time with you entire fleet and that is a questionable design choice. A small system to target different ships would be nice in Command mode. The overall gameplay is very nice. Sometimes maneuvering big ships can be frustrating in places with a high amount of ships and planets, but is not that bad. We have three control types: Keyboard Only, Mouse and Keyboard, and Gamepad. This is very nice and completely user configurable, from colors to buttons, keys, even control schemes.\n\nAnd well, we can’t have it all… No true multiplayer mode(can’t fight other players in real-time) the AI takes over other people’s ship designs and places them in your worlds. Obviously, you need to upload your fleet when you go through a wormhole. Last time a tried that Steam completely crashed, so some additional work towards multiplayer would be appreciated.

You choose one of many playable factions, each unique in the parts and weapons available to them.  Using said parts, you create a 2D spaceship and begin to pioneer your faction to victory.\n\nThings to note:\n-This game has no story.  It is purely driven by you making a story yourself, or simply wanting to conquer the generated world.\n\n-All movement in the game is physics based, and your ships are only as good as you build them.  This means there is something similar to a puzzle/strategy aspect of the game when building your ships.  If this is unappealing, I would be hesitant to recommend this game to you.\nA possible solution to this problem is the implementation of the Steam Workshop.  This allows people to upload entire factions/fleets for you to use, but in my opinion you are mission out on half if not more of the game if you aren't building things.\n\n-Replay value is arguable, and very dependant on the player.  If you are someone who likes experimenting with strategies, or challenging yourself by say, limiting your options by a personal rule, then you will most likely find it easy to sink hours into Reassembly.\n\nIn closing, I will simply say that Reassembly is a very rewarding game for those who enjoy top-down shooters, side scrollers, and creating functional and even beautiful things.  If you find it difficult to find personal motivation with a game, maybe double check other games on your wishlist before buying.\n\nP.S.

It is a beautiful, fun game that facinates. The developer works very hard, is involved with the community, and listens to ideas! I cannot wait to watch this game go from beta to release. The Beta is VERY stable with a few UI design that need some tweaking. But this does not mar the game at all.\n\nIt is so easy to get lost in Reassembly. I continually tweak, change, upgrade, rehash, redesign, and customize my ships. Its facinating to watch your own creation evolve as you gain access to more and more powerful weapons. Such a joy.\nThe world is vast in scope, colorful, busy, living and beautiful. The "grind" in this game is fun because you get to build, test and tweak your ship exactly the waty you want too.\n\nThere are three different ways to control the ship which can take some getting use too, but they all work very well. The art choice is stellar, and beautiful. And the ambiant music sets such an amazing tone as you realize you are a very small dot in a expansive universe. Nothing is as exciting as watching your mini probe evolve into a giant mother ship.\n\nNot enough good things can really be said. If you dont want to pay the price now, wait till its cheaper. The game is highly worth it either way! I shall leave it at this, if not i will just continue rambling.\n\nBut really...its Legos that actually fire lazers and fly.

I'm usually a little worried when I look at an alpha stage game because I have a few that I have bought in the past and never play, not because it was necessarily a bad game, or that the devs were bad, but because I have a very short attention span, and a lot of games.  The games that I tend to focus on are ones like reassembly, because you can take it as seriously as you want and the gameplay is ongoing, as in, you can go through wormholes and either upload the fleet you have currently in your saved ship designs chart, or you can actually 'go through' the wormhole and end up in an entirely different universe.  This is actually the part that I like most about the game, the first time I ran into a wormhole I decided to see what it did, after I went through my computer crashed and it deleted my whole save, which made me kinda sad, mainly because I thought my fleet just leaft me wouldn't come back, but ever since it has worked great.\n\nOther than it crashing that one time, this game is spectacular, you are provided with 8 factions to play as(I think there are 8 playable one's anyway), and each faction has loads of powerful weapons and methods of defense.  The game makes it feel as though you are actually the commander of a whole race(being able to change the production of any factory weilding ship or station), and a power limit that allows you to construct massive ships bristling with weaponry.  The graphics are 2D, but that seriously doesn't matter, the visual effects are stunning, and the sound effects are also top-notch.  The ship crafting system is just like they promise, you can build anything you want, given you have ingenuity and know how shapes work.  The soundtrack is surprisingly good for galactic domination, and has a very spacy, electronicy feel.  The A.I. is pretty smart, not human smart, but it will use it's advantages against you, especially agent ships, cuz remember, they could be made by me, or you, or anybody.  With all that other stuff in mind, I have a pretty nice computer and a really old and outdated monitor, so i run most games on ultra, except crysis, or that type of stuff.  Most of the time this game runs fine, but if i have a big fleet, and im fighting a huge battle with hundreds of ships, it gets quite laggy until everything is dead.\n\nThe basic facts are as follows:\nPros:\n- Gameplay is fast paced and fun\n- Makes you feel like the king of a space empire\n- Ship-building system is perfect\n- Graphics yo\n- Sounds great\n- Agents add tremendous difficulty\n- it's quality ♥♥♥♥, buy it\n\nCons:\n- Large fleet battles can cause lag\n- crashes are few and far between, but excpected, cuz beta","March 18, 2015","true","186.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Your civilization is using the ships you've designed so you can see the progress throughout the galaxy as you iteratively upgrade your ships to be bigger, better, faster, stronger and annihilate all opposition in an extremely satisfying way.\n\nThanks to wormohles (author calls it async multiplayer), you wage war against other players' creatinos and send your warships into other people's universes to do the same! This is a fantastic way to deliver user generated content directly in the game without hassle and reward you for contributing - sending your creations to wreak havoc in parallel universes. How cool is that?!\n\nI love space games, especially 2D ones like Space Pirates And Zombies and I also love engineering games where I build vehicles myself for efficiency (Robocraft, From the Depths, Space Engineers) and this game brings so much to the table I sit here with my mind blown.\n\nDid I menion one of the 7 playable races is using bloody penrose tiles?

You can make just about anything in this game from tiny scout fighters to giant dreadnaughts and space stations. Installed it and played it trying to keep making the better ship only to lose track of time 4 hours later. This is a great time killer. Graphics are unique, gameplay is solid, though can be repetitive at times with gathering resources.\n\nI do hope they plan on adding ship sharing perhaps via steam workshop. Currently the only wait to see other peoples ships are to hunt down “agents” which are usually player made ships most of the time. I’m still grasping the game within the first 4 hours if me losing track of time.  Hopefully in the future, we have the ability of a more diverse fleet command system, and more parts. All in all, great game for $15 full price.\n\nEDIT: I should note that after putting more time into the game, I have found that you can download player fleets by just going to the Reassembly Homepage and looking at the sync list. Its as easy as just downloading and importing fleets. Check it out: http://www.anisopteragames.com/sync/latest.html\n\nOn another note, I only played as the first faction. Upon unlocking more factions, you have unique parts and weapons used by that faction. So there is quite a variety with the 6 or 7 different factions available right now. Definitely hard to break away from this, as I'm constantly facing player made fleets and always trying to enhance my fleet to defeat that fleet.

Eventually add a factory to it so you manufacture ships, maybe even give them factories so they can make more...\nPut simply, there's a million different things to do. There's a reason this game doesn't have a single bad review - There's next to no complaints. The only thing I could comment on is what I think could be added, but it's all minor stuff like multiplayer.\nThe style is amazing. Using just vectors and particle physics the game is beautiful and doesn't need textures. It's appealing to the eye and good on those older computers.\nThe gameplay mirrors this. It's imple WASD to move, mouse to look, and mouse buttons to shoot. However weapon variants are high. Some are turret types that follow your mouse, some are fixed. You've got everything from plasma weaponry (Moderate range and moderate damage) to the feared Antimatter cannon (Moderate range EXTREMELY high damage.)\nIf you've ever wanted a game that actually brings something new to the "creative sandbox" genre, this game is for you.

Build ship fleet and destroy other ships is great\n\nShort Review:\n\n+ Beautiful graphics\n+ Good gameplay\n+ Awesome features\n+ Randomly Generated World\n+ Wormhole feature to make a new world for replayability\n+Amazing ship building feature\n\n-Saves can be deleted from bugs that I've encountered (3 TIMES ALREADY)\n-Performance issues on Yellow Plant Faction, even with beefy PC's\n\nLong Version: Reassembly is a vector-graphics game with a great original topic. This game can be very addicting. The one thing i do encounter in this game is the repititive gameplay. Eventually, you will get maximum Power to upgrade your ship until you cant upgrade it anymore, creating a big, strong ship/fleet. When you go to this part, you will see it is easy to pick off the small and huge ships in the center, even if they swarm you, you would just easily kill all of them off. I do recommend to the Dev(s) to create bigger ships or even create it so that the bigger P you have, the bigger the enemy ships get. Sort of like "evolution" (idk lol). This suggestion would take time, but will be worth it.\n\nI have played this game for hours and it is extremely fun to play. I get more excited for updates in the game rather than updates for others (except Running With RIfles), even if they are just bugfixes.\n\nOverall: Game is very fun and addictive. its gr8 m8 i r8 8/8","February 2, 2015","true","87.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you liked SPAZ or Starsector, you’ll LOVE this game!\n\nFor a game made by one guy, heck, even compared to other indie games with teams of developers, Reassembly ranks up with there with my favorites. Reassembly can be compared to Space Pirates and Zombies and Starsector, 2 other top-down space exploration/combat games; however, Reassembly has them both beat in customizability, unscripted expansion/development of the player faction, and ambience. The gameplay is easy to get into and gets as complex as your creativity can make it, yet still retains simplicity which makes it easy and fun to sit there creating a large complex spaceship tailored to your desires. As you expand and grow your faction, your AI will begin building ships you design for them and in order to expand more you could employ many ways to take over sectors of the galaxy. From bringing a fleet of ships to having a carrier with masses of drones or even piloting a singular dreadnought to carve through enemy territory, or even coming up with your own tactics as you can create any kind of ship you want block by block (even copy pasting big chunks of ships to create modular designs) the designs are limitless!\n\nAs for quantity of content, the base factions are interesting but when they get bland the developer made Reassembly open source allowing anyone to easily create their own factions or even universe altering mods and upload them for anyone to download and play from the Steam Workshop. The community, while small, is one of the nicest and most dedicated I’ve seen, and you’ll definitely never run out of quality new factions to download and try out or play against. This includes mods that change the entire galaxy to a star wars themed galactic war to mods that create a 2 faction war between humans and zombies in space, to... well just check the Workshop and you’ll see all the amazing stuff going on!\n","March 27","true","49.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chuppie/recommended/329130/","chuppie","Noblivion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chuppie/","248 products in account","TL;DR Reassembly is a game that won't let you go even after dozens of hours, keeping you busy building your own Death Star and then sending a fleet of those to ruin someone's day.\n\nThe Spacetacular Spaceventure.\nReassembly is all about space and freedom of it. There are seven factions available, each with their own unique playstyle. You can peacefully grow plants and extract energy from solar panels, or you can set up your own fleet of doom and plunder the galaxy. You can take things down with precise lasers, continuous beams, play a pew-pew-em-up with plasma cannons and if that doesn't help - spam them with missiles until they die. For those who desire exotic methods of space annihilation, make your own sawblade of death. Choices are limitless.\n\nRight in from the childhood.\nThere are just three resources in this game: R(esource), C(urrency) and P(ower), each made to limit or unbind your possibilities. The cycle seems to be simple - R is traded for C, C is spent on P, and P is how many hardware you can put into your ship to earn yourself more R. But it's harder than it sounds. You don't just buy hulls, glue cannons on them and go gunning things down. You build your own ship piece by piece, and that's where LEGO nostalgia hits. Space, energy and Power efficiency is what makes it hard and beautiful. You can put tons of armor and guns on your ship, but thrusters just won't carry such mass. You can be tanky and quick, but with little to no offense available. You can put powerful guns and quickly execute hit-and-run tactics, but two shots will annihilate your little scrap piece of death.\n\nSpiky plants.\nYou'll find out soon enough.\n\nDark spirit fleet has invaded.\nSo, you've made your bulky space cannon of extreme vengeful execution of space heretics and conquered the whole galaxy. And that's it? No, of course not. There are wormholes and agents.\n\nWormholes is what gives Reassembly infiniteness. When you approach a wormhole you're offered to either pass through to a newly generated galaxy, or to send your current fleet to other worlds in form of agents.\n\nAgents are what slows you down. They are well-equipped fleets made by other players, and they are extremely hard to defeat. There are usually 6-8 fleets on the galaxy map, and they're moving towards you. Slowly. But when they reach you, they start plundering your stations and ships. Until they are defeated, they'll find you and destroy you. But the reward for killing them is worth the trouble.\n\nBoooooring!\nWell then, recently there had been added Steam Workshop support. Test out all the new player ships and factions, unleash their power on others or get wrecked by their overpoweredness. I'd say that the choice is yours, but you don't really have any choice. The galaxy's cruel.\n\nConclusion\nThe best singleplayer experience I had in a while. For how much this game already has, I give it 10/10. For me, this is the indie Game of the Year.","July 21, 2015","true","61.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yes, designing the ships is fun, and testing them is fun, and the big battles are fun. However, the fun runs out quickly and there are UI issues which pretty much kill any real possibility of sinking a significant amount of time into the game due to the repetition and frustration involved.\n\nThe User Interface has a very "Early Access" feel to it. At one point after purchasing I came back to the Steam store page expecting to see an Early Access tag that I had overlooked.\n\nAt first, UI clunkiness seemed like a small problem. I liked the game. I was having fun gathering resources, turning them in, and using the cash flow to buy new techs and to make my ships bigger. Eventually I unlocked the factory, and my ships were large enough to use it. At this phase of the game you think "Cool, now I can make fleets of ships and kick even more ♥♥♥!"\n\nAnd you can, but putting a fleet together and keeping it up and running through numerous battles is just such a ♥♥♥♥ing chore. It feels like work.\n\nIt would be so much better if you could configure the way your factory makes ships. Here's how it works:  you move up to 4 ship designs into boxes at the top of the fleet screen. These designs will be built by your ship's factory when you press 'F' in-game.\n\nThe issue is that pressing 'F' builds the first ship in the queue, then the second, and so on, repeating in order and there's no way to change this. For example, you can't set up four keybindings for the 4 designs.\n\nOccasionally you can win a few big battles without changing your production queue, but more often than not you find yourself going back to the fleet screen over and over again to rearrange your build order. This is my primary complaint about the game. I might have reccommended this game and played it for months if I weren't forced to return to the awful fleet screen hundreds upon hundreds of times, simply because the developer only gave us one terrible way to build support ships.\n\nThis problem is only amplified if you decide you want to design and build some space stations. Building stations seems to be the only way to hold new areas you've moved into. If you move to an area of the map and clear out all the bad guys it will change to your faction's color, but the only way it will stay your color when you leave is if there is a station left behind which can spawn AI ships to patrol the area. So, basically, building stations is important if you want to conquer the map.\n\nThe problem is, there are good and bad places to create a station. The 4-ship repeating production queue gives you no easy way to be careful about your space station placement. If you want to be strategic, you have no choice but to go to the stinking, godforsaken fleet screen and drop a space station design into your production queue each time you find a good site where you want to lay down a new station. You'll have to make sure you drop it in the right place in the queue or it won't be next. After you've built the station and set up ITS production queue, you will have to return to your OWN production queue, delete the station, and replace it with another design.\n\nIn an area with a ton of drones? Fleet screen. Found enemy agents with large ships? Fleet screen. Is one particular type of your support ships taking heavy losses? Fleet screen. Hey, this is a great spot for a station. Fleet Screen.\n\nSo, the UI is bad. I should probably change gears: There's simply not much to do in this game once you've optimized all of your designs and you've assembled a nice fleet of ships. Once you can build full-sized ships, you will steamroll anything and everything with no surprises and no challenges to keep your interest. I was intrigued by all the talk of a huge, dynamic galaxy to conquer but the reality is that the endgame is just one-sided, imbalanced action and little else.\n\nThe map is terrible. It's hideous. It's a super-chunky grid with different colors to represent factions. The result is very ugly, and gets more and more atrocious the more you explore. You can't zoom or scroll the map, and you can't change or hide the overlays. The minimap in-game is just as bad. It's hard to see useful information, and you can make it either small or smaller.\n\nThere are other issues as well. The AI is not that great. This is really an issue when you spawn 10 support ships and pray to god that they don't cause a pileup and all get left behind in an asteroid field. This will happen even with small ships that are the most maneuverable craft in the game. Yes, your fleet that you saved up resources to build can easily get left behind on a high speed trip because they are truly terrible at avoiding stationary objects.\n\nAlso, ships get stuck together all the time while they are "rebuilding" themselves after taking damage, or right after they spawn from your factory on your main ship. It's laughable, as the two ships are merged and the AI ship is using all of its thrusters trying to go somewhere making it impossible to go where you are trying to go.\n\nSo all-in-all this feels like a half-finished Early Access title with potential. Unfortunately it's a finished game.\n\nSummary: Game feels half-completed. Good ship designing, good action, VERY BAD  interface, nothing rewarding to do after unlocking all the parts and build points.","September 14, 2015","false","50.6"," 41 of 77 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","41","77","3","5"

I rarely write reviews, that's how much I enjoy this game.  So let me help you decide since you're still reading because you're too lazy to watch a video clip of it on youtube (j/k, i read reviews of games before I buy too).  Do you like:\n- sci fi games?  (Starcraft, EVE Online, Alpha Centauri)\n- building characters in RPGs, building empires in 4X games, or creating custom units?  (think Armored Core, Alpha Centauri's unit editor, etc.)\n- 2D arcade shooters, or people who like shooting things in general?\n\nThis game has elements of all of those.  Has a fun difficulty to it too, learning the mechanics, and being caught offguard by something new because you fight other people's spaceships in space sometimes, lol.  Testing your shapceships in automated AI duels against other player's spaceships is entertaining too, like watching a tournament in eSports.  Very entertaining game, excellent graphics, awesome soundtrack.  Music is the kind of rare video game music that you can listen to for hours and still enjoy.  The music reminds me of the PC game "Shatter" soundtrack - a game which I've never played before but love the music of (look up Shatter OST on youtube).  Highly recommend Reassembly.

Focus is on design and some very arcade style combat.\n\nNOTE: I haven't played past the first 'race' - and the playstyle of other races are different - but in a limited sense.\n\nIn theory you could do economy building, but you only control one ship (effectively) so actually building a economy to produce masses of ships appears a distant dream.\n\nComplaints about the balance are justified.  Ships designed by other players will inhabit your world, and they run the gammut from harmless to ... very challenging.\n\nI'm continuously annoyed by 3 things.\n\n1 - Economic development is unmanageable, and resource farms are often eradicated by combat.  It's not merely a re-seed problem - you can actually destroy asteroids - the 'ground' on which you plant farms.  Only one faction can effectively generate farms. Humans can push asteroids around and then hope that seeds spawn before the plants / asteroids are destroyed by combat.\n\n2 - The blocks aren't standardized.  The slight differences in size and connection point locations are amazingly frustrating.  75% of my ship design time is spent trying to find a way of connecting blocks that are off by a few pixels.\nAs a bonus sometimes the order in which you assemble the exact same shape can allow or disallow a connection.\n\n3 - Progression is very shallow.  You can spend your 'money' on:\n- new weapons / modules (but nothing outside your faction and there is no 'tree' or research time, just a list of items and prices).\n- AI ships (like one of your faction's ships?, you could make one or just buy it)\n- Size limit increases.\n\n'Size limit' is the only thing that prevents you from making collossal ships at the start.  Modules and Weapons (but not hull) have a complexity cost, and your complexity limit starts at 300.  You simply spend 'money' to buy a larger limit, and 2000 appears to be a good target for a good combat design.\n\nYou also have resources which are used to produce new ships.  You can trade resources for 'money' by dropping them off at a station (I haven't discovered any enemy stations).\n\n","June 20, 2015","false","15.3"," 24 of 44 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","24","44","0","0"

Build ship, gather resources, build bigger ship, smash enemies. That part of this game is fun. However, it's a broken PoS. Half the things don't work properly.\n\nList of broken stuff:\n-Drones fly off without reason into space and die.\n-Missle targeting flys around in circles for no reason.\n-Auto-target turrets don't auto-target 75% of the time. They sit there idling.\n-Auto-fire doesn't auto-fire when enemies are nearby 75% of the time. They sit there idling (noticing a pattern here?).\n-Ship re-building randomly doesn't work. Once, I was half-dead, went to allied territory and went to take a leak. Then I made a sandwich. Came back 5 minutes later and I still wasn't rebuilt. I had to exit and re-enter the game.\n-Sheilds randomly malfunction . No, there was not an EMP, the sheilds simply didn't want to turn on so I had to go kill myself to get them to work again (even though dying in this game isn't much of a consequence, it's still annoying!).\n-Thrusters on the side of the ship do jack-all. No matter what angle I put them at, strafing is a hundred times slower than going backward and forward. I put LITERALLY 10 times more thrusters on the sides of the ship than on the back of the ship, and no change. Barely any strafing at all. A thruster on the side of the ship does 1/100th the power of a thruster on the back/forward of the ship simply for the fact that it's on the side. I'm not sure if this is a glitch or if it's designed to be like that, either way, it's really damn annoying.\n-Half the time, the ship I'm currently flying either wants to go forward, or turn. Never both at the same time, but one or the other, exclusively.\n-Entering or exiting a menu resets the volume of the music to MAXIMUM. I play with my speakers pretty high up and turn most of the in-game volume down. This usually isn't a problem except in this game. Every time I go into the menu to change my ship, my fleet's ships, check the map, or pause the game, the volume for the music cranks all the way up to 100% for about a second, deafening me. This is more of a personal problem, but it's just another glitch that shows the game released too soon.\n-Every third game, my base spawns in the middle of god damned no where. No enemies within a hundred miles. Just dead, deep space between me and them. At the beginning of the game, you're especially weak, so you rely on your allies to help significantly, but it's impossible in these games, so the best advice I have is to just remake it. Another annoyance.\n-Every few minutes more I play this game I find another glitch/bug/thing I don't like.\n\nPositives:\n-Music is awesome. It gets my blood pumping at times and at others it makes me sit back and relax to the joys of the graphics.\n-Looks awesome. The graphics of this game are amazing. Beautifully done.\n-Ship building is simple, yet deceptively complex. You can't simply stick a massive shield on one side of the ship and have it work properly. You need to counter-balance it with another shield, or something with similar mass. Center of gravity of the ship actually matters and you can easily build a ship by accident that can only fly in circles. I love that!\n-Individual part destruction. When a part gets hit, you lose it, simple as that. If you lose your left aft engines, then guess what, you're flying in circles 'till it regenerates buddy.\n-Individual part regeneration. After a short period (dependant on the part), it regenerates, free of cost, without having to go back to a station to repair and refuel.\n-Unlock a part and you can use it as many times as you like.\n-Free ship re-design. Re-design your ship over and over and over aaaaaand oooooooveeeeeeer again all you want, it's free. You're gonna need those remakes to create a good one. You don't even have to enter a spaceport and whatnot.\n\nOnce again, I'd love to love this game, I really would. There's a lot of great features and design aspects of the game I really love, but it's just not finished. It's just yet another game released before its time.","July 29, 2015","false","5.1"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","19","35","2","2"

I have to say for anyone who loves building space ships this as its going is a must buy. To give you an understanding of the game you start as a small prebuild ship which over time with enough resources you can make your own or even just start making your own right away. At the start i spent 2 hours building ships and watching the testing battles than actually playing the core game which isunt even done yet. In short this game is great even in Early Access and unless you play it for your self you will have a hard time seeing if you like this game. But i will say even as fun and addicting as this game is there are some things not finished and even small down sides for instance the gameplay its self is very simple on its own but is completly over shadowed by the rest of the game which is great. Honesly i hope people buy this game to try it out as it may not appeal to everyone but it is in no right a bad game and i hope for the best that this game will be fantastic and live up to the developers and the communitys expectations.","December 30, 2014","true","825.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was part of alpha since the summer, and ever since my first glance at the game I was in love. Polygons with partical effects moving polygon clumps that fire polygons with effects at other polygons? What not to love! Although the graphical style is symplistic, it keeps amazing me how complex a ship that's essentially shifting shades of  two colours can look. Gameplay? Great. Although at times I dearly wish there was a way to choose your spawn point so you don't get almost trapped at a station over and over again because enemies keep attacking you as you spawn, it's for the most part rediculously fun trying to continually improve your ship to take down enemies while at the same time making a fleet that's not too shabby for fighting.\n\nWhat do I Give this? Solid 8/10. It could do better in some respects, so it's not worthy of a nine, and in my opinion no game is ever worth a ten since there are faults in every game, but for the most part I'm in love. I highly recommend this game and I also believe that the thirty dollars will be worth it to help with the development and likely get your ideas implemented, as well as getting to see the game evolve into it's final state like I and many others have been doing for a long time.","December 10, 2014","true","42.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Completing objectives like capturing points and killing enemies awards you with upgrade points that you can use to buy more weapons and systems for your ships. You can start from the ground up to customize your ship, which gives you the freedom to make a spectacularly crappy ship or the ship of awesome, all governed by how many upgrade points you put into ship total size. It's so fun, and I constantly go back and tweak ships when I unlock new techs.\n\nThe price is higher than an indie game, and that's a bit of a negative, but there is plenty of value in the ship customization. There are different ship races to unlock, so there is a bit of replay value. The ship races differ dramatically, so it feels different evey time you start fresh with a new race.\n\nCreativity in ship building is the shining point of this game, and I'm glad I bought it.\n\nThis game is fun and functional in its early access state, so don't worry about buying something buggy and unfinished.

The best part, obviously, is building your own ships and experimenting with designs.  As you gather resources you can purchase better parts.  Each of the factions have a unique theme and require different strategies to design. The ship building interface is very intuitive and easy to use, which is a big plus.\n\nIt's a nice, chill single player game but I think overall it lacks depth, which I will describe below.\nThere's really no need for specialization against any particular foe. With such flexibility in ship design I was hoping this game could push this concept more.  Once you have a decent ship it works against all factions almost universally. You can fiddle with designs for a while, but in the end, more expensive parts will make you better.  With many factions it's quickest to destroy enemy ships for resources, so that becomes your sole focus.  Once you max out your ship, basically nothing stands in your way.  Unless you tried to get all the Steam achievements, like I did, there's not much of an end game to keep you playing.  I spent most of my time on this game grinding out achievements.\n\nIn conclusion, it was fun but lack of depth put me on the fence on this one.  After getting all of the achievements, I feel like I tapped out all of my reasons to keep playing.   I would have liked to see the ship building aspect developed further.  I'm leaning on the fence to recommend this game, but it was still fun for the time being.   If you feel like this game might be something you'll be interested in then you'll probably enjoy it.","March 6","true","67.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have to say, I really like this game. There are somethings that could be done, like more content.There is just a lot of things in certian faction where as others, they're really empty. I spent my first session on this game, and completed it within 12hours(hit the cap and conqured the map (once) and got allraces). That's one sitting. (on weekend) I really wish some more things were added to it, mods filled the rest but it's just grinding and doing the same things over again. I built a fleet to the size of 700+ ships. NOTHING STANDS IN YOUR WAY. I'm talking cheap small ships though, like 42-45p. The 8000P Cap is dis-tasteful. Although I got a mod to increase the maxium amount of P. It feels dead. There is nothing striving me forward. Usually, when I play games were you reach an extent of 'stability' in a game, I would decide to expand and make things more efficient, bigger, better than they're suppose to be in the first place. (like an ever growing population) This game is diffrent. You have to Build a ship, and get stations, and farm resources. That aside, I really loved this game with building, customizing, there is alot of freedom to it that I enjoy. One things I found a very easy way to exploit was to just put all my weapons on Point Defense. No need for me too actually use my guns myself. Another thing I hated was the weapons, there wasn't any speacialization or limitations with what I could stick on my ship as long as it could fit with the P limitation it was fine. I am happy with the factions we have, I don't think neccesarily we need more. A storyline would be nice, I just go around shooting everything instead of expanding with friendlies, making alliances, trading, capital ships. I wish this game was a lot more than it is now. One more thing I like to add is the AI, the AI doesn't know how to do anything. All my weapons carve straight to their core after they decide to 'rush' me.\n\n\nPROS:\n*Great Community\n*Great Mods\n*Great custimization and build\n*Great Potential\n\n\nCONS:\n*Lacks content and variation\n*Limitation in P\n*Challenging Enemies\n*Once you hit endgame, nothing can touch you.\n*AI Lacks\n\n\n5.745/10","January 31","false","29.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","7"

The amount of blocks and the gorgeous art style doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe factions are very very unique from each other and each faction has different kinds of blocks/weapons/ship parts.This game is what Ive been hoping for! Its not overly complicated and and has about 6 or 7 factions at its current build.\n\nIt has a random/procedural generated galaxy and has an endless amount of galaxies via wormholes! ( wormholes are the means of travel into other new galaxies )\n\nYou can upload your fleet/ships and other players would see your ships invading their galaxy! Awesome right?!\n\nFor example: Id see a cool ship and if i hover my cursor over it I would be able to see the name of the player who made it and the name of of his ship!\n\nOverall this game is very addicting and would even be more so when more parts are added in the future!\n\nId score this game a solid:\n\n8.5-9/10 at its current build and could easily be a 10/10 with the more upcoming updates!\n\nI hope this helped!

There are elements of building, space combat, and rts (in a somewhat abstract way). The game allows great creativity in shipbuilding style and combat philosphy.\n\nI find this game to be great fun. You can start with a pre-built ship, or make your own right away. The game includes an AI driven tester that will pit your design against other designs so that you can tweak and perfect your ship before flying it. I prefer to fly around and earn some credits first for upgrades. The goal is simple - expand your territory, earn credits, use credits to upgrade the power level of ship you are permitted to fly, unlock upgrades and build better ships.\n\nThe game learns from how you play and from facing your ships. Eventually you will face ships made by other players. Also you will unlock other factions that you can play which have different ship components. The replay value is immense as no playthrough will ever be identical to another.\n\nThe graphics are clean and simple, not ultra-detailed, with nice effects, slightly retro and modern at the same time.  The game includes excellent controller support for in-game play, but for ship creation you have to use mouse and keyboard. I think controller support for the building phase of the game would probably be awkward and difficult to implement, so I don't blame the devs...\n\n10/10 If there is something wrong with this game, I don't know what it is!","February 21, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ever played a game and wished you could tweak your ship?  Well now you can.\nAny type of ship imaginable is buildable: Carriers that launch leigons of drone fighters; Battleships with heavy cannons and a myriad of point defense lasers; Missile Cruisers with racks upon racks of guided missiles; Destroyers with cannons, lasers, beam weapons, and torpedo launchers; Fighters with rapid-fire plasma guns, lasers, and rockets.  Weapons can be bound to control groups and can be set to fire in grouped bursts or in a continuous chain.\n\nThe game starts you out with a well-made tutorial.  It provides guidance on learning the game and getting your fleet up and running (yes, you can build ships that can build more ships), without being intrusive or pushy.  All of this building requires competing for and collecting the resources that grow on nearby asteroids.  These raw resources can then be used to construct additional ships or exchanged at one of the friendly stations you've activated for credits to fund research and fleet upgrades.\n\nThe physics in this game are fantastic.  Fire a heavy cannon, and your ship recoils.  Hit something or blow something up, and chunks fly off and blow apart.  The field of wreckage that remains after an epic battle is part of what makes this game so satisfying.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful.  Colors and effects are vibrant. (Just go look at the screenshots!)\n\nThe music is suitable and soothing, but not particularly noteworthy, but the sound effects from firing weapons are right on point.\n\nThere are still a few bugs.  The game never seems to remember my control settings, and the game sometimes has trouble starting (restarting the launcher seems to work for the latter).\n\nTLDR:  I don't usually write reviews, but this game is too awesome not to.

A physics-based WASD space shooter nestled in the most enjoyable sandbox builder I've ever played.\n\nPros    Your ship is constantly rebuilding itself - leading to great gameplay moments like sniping enemy cores, narrow escapes, on-the-fly hull redesign, etc...\nInstead of being a solo ship, you are part of a faction. You gain acess to new tech and bigger ships by advancing your faction's power which does a great job of making you feel integrated into the game world.\nEach faction is very diverse, with its own unique attributes and building elements. These constraints help shipbuilding to stay fresh and encourage experimentation.\nFantastic ship editor makes it fun and easy to make your designs real.\nGood tutorial to get you started with the core mechanics.\nCommunity content - at any time you can approach a wormhole and upload your fleet. These fleets can then spawn in other players' games. What makes this awesome is that you don't just encounter single ships from these fleets, but whole communities with multiple ship styles from the same user.\nA sense of progression. I typically lose interest in sandbox builders where you have to collect resources to use in crafting. Reassembly uses point-based ship construction, so you don't have to collect resources to build your ship - just to expand your point cap. This gives you concrete goals to work towards over time, while again providing constraints to motivate continual re-design of your fleet.\nCons    You haven't purchased this game yet!

They will probably start by dogfighting their plastic creations, but sooner or later they will be taking turns to throw each spaceship into the other. This is the game of those models.\n\nReassembly's ship creation is simple but pretty intricate in its outcome - you strap 2D weapons, components, inert hull pieces and engines to your command module until you're happy with the result. Ships can be any size, shape, scale (ships can be worth 50 points or 8000), tactical role and degree of effectiveness. You could build the Serenity, a Star Destroyer, a butterfly, a cartoon house with drone launchers in the windows, a space station shaped like Dover Castle or even a sniper rifle with a spinal death weapon for the barrel and a point defence laser for the trigger.\n\nAt any time during the customisation you can press the 'test' button, and the AI will fly the ship against available stock designs in a 1v1 arena battle. You can also use the tournament game mode to watch battles between selected designs from any of your save files, any of your friends' save files and any .lua files someone has shared elsewhere on the internet. The devs run occasional open tournaments for ship designs, as do some youtubers.\n\nSingle player is utterly devoid of story, it's basically a sandbox galaxy in which various mutually hostile factions hold territory. Kill things and provide R (the production resource) to your factory ships to gain C (research resource). Use C to increase your ship's build limit and unlock new components to play with, or to hire friendly ships to follow you around. Install a factory on your ship to be able to spend R on your custom escort ships, which you can release for more C. Conquer and comsume the galaxy, find a wormhole, travel to the next galaxy and start over. The visuals are pretty nice, the opposing factions are diverse and the fact that your escort ships are ones you yourself have designed makes the campaign feel more exclusive and personal in a 4X-ey sort fo way.\n\nThe 7 playable factions generally handle differently, which adds some replayability. Some factions have diamond or rhombus hull pieces, changing their look and design priorities. there's a faction with really cheap shield generators and sniper cannons that can spawn resource-generating space-plants, there's a faction with cheap high-damage weapons and deadly beam drones but very little effective armour, there's a faction whose only direct weapon is a spinal plasma launcher you build by stacking modular components on top of each other. There's one faction that gets nuke launchers and melee spikes.\n\nOn the downside though, some of the factions get their playstyle from a lack of versatlity and a poor choice of components. It's pretty demoralising to look at a new faction's full array of hardware and think 'is this it?' Tournaments can be dominated by Faction 4 (the modular plasma cannon one) and by 'spinny ships' (that exploit the AI's ability to lead targets, making them impossible to hit), the music is good but can be intrusive and gets repetitive after the first dozen hours or so. The campaign has almost no ships bigger than 3000P, meaning a player with the cap of 8000P gets to stomp everything with little effort or interesting events. They are small complaints but they do add up sometimes.\n\nTo finish, I'll say that Rassembly holds its players' attention not with a scripted or even emergent narrative, or with a great challenge, but with the promise of having something to tinker with. Working out the strengths of each weapon or design, using those extra 200P to give your flagship a little more punch, and reverse-engineering a design you saw on youtube that one time, are what contributes to an addictive and engaging experience that's well worth the £11 it asks for.","April 6, 2015","true","231.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Similar to how Minecraft combined a 3D action sort of a game with gameplay that revolves around creativity using blocks and crafting, Reassembly does something similar in a sense. The combination of certain creative and radical mechanics with an existing game format makes for something much greater and more enjoyable in Reassembly.  The mechanics of the game when you are flying your spaceship remind me of asteroids, but the game is a lot deeper than that.  Reassembly is a top-down space shooter combined with a very open design mode where players create spaceships out of connectable pieces.  It also features reproducing spaceships :)\n\nIn the video posted here on Steam, the creator of the game mentions something about creating things of function and beauty.  In reassembly, both function and beauty are valuable end-goals for player creations.  No one likes an ugly ship.  However, since ships reproduce, it is important that the ships are viable.  If you want a ship to turn well and quickly, you have think out where to place the engines so that they rotate the ship.  If you want to protect the core, you may have to surround it with armor.  Design in the game becomes a very interesting process as the original concepts behind a design merge with the necessary requirements for survivability to generate successful ships, or perhaps I should say, successful offspring.","January 19, 2015","true","97.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It also has some of the most immersive aesthetics and mechanics of any game I've ever played. I have learned to approach it with the caution of a recovering drug addict in a pharmacy-- if I click the icon I can expect to lose at least several hours of my time, if not portions of my health, dreams, and/or general human function.\n\nCriticisms: The only reasons I would hesitate to recommend it to my friends in its current state are 1) the effective lack of directed multiplayer, 2) the comparative ease once you start building capital ships, and 3) the lack of polish/balance across some of the playable factions.\n\n1) I found in my playtime that some of what I enjoyed most in the game was the ship design testing process, where at any point you can place your design in the hands of an AI and have it fight best-of-three battles against up to five different AI controlled ships of similar power levels. I would love to have the ability to put my designs up against the designs of my friends and other players, whether one-on-one, faction vs faction, or in larger skirmishes or king of the hill matches.\n\n2) Speaking of the king, once I completed a 8000P juggernaut and spent some time retooling my fleet even the center factions posed little threat (provided I didn't park in a plant faction death cluster or otherwise act a fool). As well, there was no longer any real use for the upgrade currency one you've maxed out the P limit and purchased all the weapon tiles. I haven't tried to achieve complete dominion of the entire game map yet, but the endgame isn't presently as enjoyable as the 20-30 hours I spent reaching it with the first faction (which is a pretty happy problem, granted).\n\n3) As for the factions, the first one has tiles complete with descriptions giving you an idea of each tile's use, as well as some flavor text. The other factions (more recently added to the playable roster) are a bit of a mixed bag, and often require playtesting in order to determine what certain tiles do, or why two similar appearing tiles may have very different power costs. I'm sure this will improve as the game nears release.\n\n\nConclusion: This is an excellent indie space sim that melds the fun parts of designing ships with elements of RTS and simple asteroids-style gameplay. It is worth the $30 as is, and I'm excited to see the rest of what the developers pack in before it hits release.","January 28, 2015","true","98.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As the player becomes more experienced, new shapes unlock, leading to some truly impressive creations. What's more, the fleets that other players have made are imported onto the map as 'Agents', meaning that, in addition to the various types of standard enemies, the player has to go up against the creations of fellow players - controlled by the AI, but built by humans. Some of the are quite brilliant.\n\nUnlocking the most expensive pieces can be a grind, and the game doesn't tutorialise nearly as well as it should (there is a fair bit of advice online), but after many hours I still find plenty to keep me busy.\n\nAnd if you ever encounter one of my capital ships, here's a tip: keep astern. For the life of me, I can't seem to design a ship with a decent turning speed.","November 6, 2015","true","62.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I liked the look of it. Sandboxish, procedural generation, top-down arcade feel. I played the very early alpha version and was entertained for a few hours. I soon lost interest, and the game became stale to me.\n\nSince then I've come back to the game again and again. It's one of those games you'll get pumped about and think about all day only to come home from work and play it till you drop. It's enjoyment for me comes in short bursts.\n\nRecently I've made a discovery. The game does not play itself. People complain about how tedious it is to capture systems and hold them. They say something along the lines of "Once you capture it there is no point. Your ships don't spawn there and you get no resources." Now listen here, that is where you are wrong.\n\nYou can build space stations that bristle with defenses and hold their own agains enemy capital ships. Alternatively, that space station can be covered in solar arrays to slowly farm you resources. Recently one of my favorite things to do is populate enemy territory with little "Outpost" stations via a factory on one of my ships. I then spend time fighting on the front line with my fleet to push the enemy out. This game is all about how you play it.\n\nIn summary, Reassembly is a great game. It's hard to find anything else out there even close to it (I think of S.P.A.Z. as the only other game that resembles it, another great by the way). Keep giving it a chance and you'll get a lot of replayability out of it. If you enter with a closed mind you'll get a closed off experiance. I highly recommend it.","October 18, 2015","true","118.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So here I am.\n\nA 2D top down space shooter whilst accurate, is a poor description for this game as there is much more to it than that.  The graphics although basic are perfect for the game.  The sound is also well chosen.\n\nYou start in a pre-designed ship but as time goes on you can add to the design or just create a new one from scratch.  There are a decent variety of weapons and other modules to choose from, like rockets, missiles, torpedoes, mines, lasers, projectile based weapons and crazier ones.  Your ships can also house a factory to build other ships on the fly, which in turn can have a factory and can build.  With a bit of time you can have a fleet of AI controlled ships following you around until you dismiss them to do their own thing, and they do.  AI ships not under your control will continue to gather resources and contribute to your factions efforts.  Time to colonise and control the galaxy!\n\nThe map is large, and the factions varied, although I am now starting to get slightly bored of the existing factions, but there are many more in the Steam Workshop.\n\nMy only criticisms of the game are as follows; Agents, which are player made ships that spawn into the game and severely ruin your day, are often too good and numerous when they first appear.  You could ignore them until stronger, however once you give them a foothold in the galaxy they are really hard to remove.  In addition, you reach the endgame of progression in terms of unlocking blocks and maximum ship size too soon, normally after a couple of hours.\n\nAll being told, an excellent buy.","January 17","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love space, spaceships, and I love games where there's something that lets my creativity run wild. Glad I found this gem!\n\nThis is a game where you control a single ship of faction you choose at the beginning of the game. You can customize it however you want it with the pieces the faction provides. Each faction is unique in a way and none are the same. You fly around, you shoot enemies, gather resources, unlock new modules, grow in power, build up your ship to become an unstoppable destroyer, unlock other factions to play as, and so on.\n\nOf course you don't need to fly alone, you can build up your fleet, or hire pilots from your faction to join you and fly with it. You'll soon be able to conquer the entire galaxy. Also, the galaxy has a fair amount of 'agents', which are fleets that were made by other players. Most of the ones I've seen so far were pretty formidable so if you see a red arrow, you should run until you really feel confident you'll break their ships with ease. Oh, and if you're done playing in that one galaxy you started in? Use a wormhole to fly to another one! This will also upload your current fleet, and chances are, someone, somewhere, on planet Earth, will be soon encountering your very own fleet on their computer. And he'll probably have trouble destroying you.\n\nWhat's truly beatiful about this game is how simple it looks, and how complex it actually is. You could actually consider this game some sort of art. You start in a tiny sector, and you can see pretty early on how dynamic the world is. The AI harvests the minerals, grows in size, expands, it gets better with you, and so on. For example, I once built a single ship that could build stations. I manufactured it from my flagship, kicked it from the fleet so it could be independent, and guess what. Soon enough, when I came back, there were like, 15 stations there, and a whole lot of tiny little fighter ships scuttling around. It was an awesome sight. To be honest, the game kinda looks more organic than scientific. It's like actual organisms battling against each other. Sort of.\n\nWell, either way, if you like space, spaceships, and space battles, if you like being creative, if you like shooting stuff up, if you like seeing your ship grow from a super fast tickling drone to a slow, massive hulking beast of absolute annihilation, if you like sending your enemies to oblivion, then chances are you're going to appreciate this game.

And that is exactly what you get with this game; an intuitive fleet building experience where the fun doesn't stop when you hit the building menues.\nI'd argue it starts there. Though admittedly half or so of my game-time was spent afk (as with most games I play), I have spent roughly 20 hours building ships, and maybe 5 actually cruising around. The 'tournament' style mode you can throw any ship you've been building into is incredibly rewarding, and oddly relaxing. Sitting back and watching the Dreadnaught you've spent an hour on go ripping through other people's lovingly crafted creations is a great system that both allows you to test out your ship against a variety of other players' designs, and serves as eye candy to the nth degree.\n\nThe game has a concept of 'agent' fleets, in which a fleet designed by other players invades your world. There is a peculiar feeling I get from this game that stems from this idea, and not even necessarily when I'm playing it. The fact that some poor player will at some point accidentaly have a run in with my fine tuned, massive killing machines gives me a sadistic pleasure that I would say is almost entirely unique to this game.\n\nA gem of a game for people of all ages, and now that it has modding support added, who knows what can come out of this game.\n","April 30, 2015","true","399.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once you unlock the factory block you can start building your own fleet with your own designs, and even pop out your own stations. Massively fun for a bit but it's really a one trick pony.\n\nThe good\nControls are good, even though you can build clunky ships.\nShip Designs are fun and designing your own fleets is quite neat.\nLots of ship designs from user generated content, also workshop support now.\nThe Organic world with it feeding and growing cycle is sweet, even if only rudimentary.\nOffer  at least 6-7 hours of good fun. More if you enjoy the editor, optimizing fleets and trying out the different races. I doubt we see much more support from the dev that adds more replyability, but you never know.\n\n\nThe bad\nController support isn't complete, feels like 80% is there and the rest just never got done.\nTutorial is a joke, it just checks for input and a couple of conditions, I accidently skipped almost half of it in the first 3 seconds. At the very list it needs to disable other inputs and walk you though it step by step.\nSimple block ship designs tend to do better than fancy. Wrong incentive.\nEditor has a snap function for connecting parts, nice but it only works 50% of the time making it almost useless.\nSome ship design are rather clunky and the AI does a good job of smashing into every solid body, Funny the first two times but it does get old really fast after that.\nLow replayability, the simulation aspect of the world isn't really complex enough to allow for new situations to arise.\n\n\nLooking forward to a sequel, I would love to see the core concepts of the game flashed out and some support for drop in multiplayer.","August 22, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players unlock new factions by killing capital ship from the latter and there are plenty of mods extending existing factions or adding new ones.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, weapons can be bound to mouse buttons or auto-fire, every faction has its specialities and different blocks with different stats and forms, the game seems quite balanced at the moment, I played 6 factions to max and did not yet encounter problems with balancing.\n\nGraphics are simplistic but beautiful, the soundtrack is hypnotic and does not get annoying and there is a lots of physics involved, the game may slow down a bit during heavy battles.\n\nThis game gets a whopping 9.5 out of 10 for making everything it wants right.","August 22, 2015","true","90.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Sure, you begin said game with fairly easy-to-use controls and ship construction, but it turns into...well... Imagine a ship which spits out more ships which destroy ships so that the first ship could gain the resources to build more ships. See where I'm going with this? It becomes a matter of power and dominance, and eventually the AI simply cannot keep up with your Ingenuity. I built a ship that was precisely what I described. Sure, by itself, it wasn't ever going to last, but when the ship has reached a maximum of around 500 drones (fighters) and a full fleet of 70 entry-level skiffs, not so much. The point is that, in this game, one can gain absurd levels of power that they can used to destroy other absurd levels of power. Anyway, if anyone wonders what the game is all about and is happening to be reading my review, then allow me to enlighten you: You begin the game with a default ship in a default faction which can be used to capture stations (spawn locations), destroy other ships, or scavenge to gain the resources to level up to allow for more stuff to be packed onto your ship or gain more stuff to pack onto your ship. Such stuff usually consists of weapons, shielding, thrusters, drone launchers, factories, harvestors, generators, etc. which become harder to place on your ship if you don't level up or don't use enough power generators to use such stuff. Once you have the upgrades you need and you have the level, you have free reign to place as many of that item on your ship as you want for ****ing free, and that is what leads to gradually overpowered ships. My advice, just fly around in a custom ship equiped with default thrusters for days and capture every single station you can. As they are mostly unguarded, it's pretty easy to rank up doing that.","December 6, 2015","true","37.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And that is exactly what you get with this game; an intuitive fleet building experience where the fun doesn't stop when you hit the building menues.\nI'd argue it starts there. Though admittedly half or so of my game-time was spent afk (as with most games I play), I have spent roughly 20 hours building ships, and maybe 5 actually cruising around. The 'tournament' style mode you can throw any ship you've been building into is incredibly rewarding, and oddly relaxing. Sitting back and watching the Dreadnaught you've spent an hour on go ripping through other people's lovingly crafted creations is a great system that both allows you to test out your ship against a variety of other players' designs, and serves as eye candy to the nth degree.\n\nThe game has a concept of 'agent' fleets, in which a fleet designed by other players invades your world. There is a peculiar feeling I get from this game that stems from this idea, and not even necessarily when I'm playing it. The fact that some poor player will at some point accidentaly have a run in with my fine tuned, massive killing machines gives me a sadistic pleasure that I would say is almost entirely unique to this game.\n\nA gem of a game for people of all ages, and now that it has modding support added, who knows what can come out of this game.\n","April 30, 2015","true","399.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am sure we are ALL glad that so has happened\n\nI appreciate your enthusiasm!!! Thank you\n\nHere is a list of what you get for your hard earned money, a list for all those that hate tricky sentences  that are not actually in english but give the impression that they are so ....\n\nYOU get your very own game developer... an eccentric young talented and apparently stubborn enough to create a game where the clean coding approach has lead it to being the most optimized solution possible allowing millions and trillions of things to happen at once inside your computer and then you can see the calculated outcomes on the big thing with a side made of glass that shines when used properly. Please feed your programmer regularly\n\nYOU get a game with lots of colours that you can change as well, these colours come in different shapes that can be changed as well but not as much as the colours ... those can be changed lots more than the shapes can, please be cautious with your colours...be very cautious with your shapes those you are NOT allowed to mess around with. Disclaimer these features do NOT work if your monitor is Black and White, also you can do anything with your shapes just don't do so in a messy fashion unless you wish to do so deliberately in which case you should be fine\n\nYOU get access to all sources of knowledge that up until now have been unseen by the academic eye and you will learn to master navigating the many choices you make, this is very important cause when you want to make a noticeable mark in a tournament you may do so by designing a cool ship that looks better than the others thus winning the Sweet generous award, it's crazy stuff! please consult your local foot therapist and take in small amounts !!\n\nYOU can finally find a good use for your mouse, and start not to use it! As the developer does not really trust your inexperienced eye to hand coordination he has made a game that you watch! You might as well give your mouse eyes and allow it to watch the game with you, the days of bashing that poor mouse is over. Disclaimer there is a mode where you use the mouse.

Sure, you begin said game with fairly easy-to-use controls and ship construction, but it turns into...well... Imagine a ship which spits out more ships which destroy ships so that the first ship could gain the resources to build more ships. See where I'm going with this? It becomes a matter of power and dominance, and eventually the AI simply cannot keep up with your Ingenuity. I built a ship that was precisely what I described. Sure, by itself, it wasn't ever going to last, but when the ship has reached a maximum of around 500 drones (fighters) and a full fleet of 70 entry-level skiffs, not so much. The point is that, in this game, one can gain absurd levels of power that they can used to destroy other absurd levels of power. Anyway, if anyone wonders what the game is all about and is happening to be reading my review, then allow me to enlighten you: You begin the game with a default ship in a default faction which can be used to capture stations (spawn locations), destroy other ships, or scavenge to gain the resources to level up to allow for more stuff to be packed onto your ship or gain more stuff to pack onto your ship. Such stuff usually consists of weapons, shielding, thrusters, drone launchers, factories, harvestors, generators, etc. which become harder to place on your ship if you don't level up or don't use enough power generators to use such stuff. Once you have the upgrades you need and you have the level, you have free reign to place as many of that item on your ship as you want for ****ing free, and that is what leads to gradually overpowered ships. My advice, just fly around in a custom ship equiped with default thrusters for days and capture every single station you can. As they are mostly unguarded, it's pretty easy to rank up doing that.","December 6, 2015","true","37.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's easy to jump into, there's unlimited creative potential in making your ships, the destruction effects are satisfying, and you never run out of things to shoot, because the only thing there really is to do is expand your territory by destroying enemy ships, of which there are in (sometimes frustrating) abundance.\nThe "passive mulitplayer" mechanic is enjoyable, because while you can't very well taunt over the wreckage of destroyed player ships hoping to give your enemy some quality killcam footage, you can still feel smug knowing you just trashed the MVP of someone else's universe without expecting them to come back for revenge.\nThe game world in its geometric minimalism is surprisingly atmospheric, almost organic, and this feeling is certainly helped by the Brian Eno-esque music.

Reassembly takes it to a whole new level, allowing you complete customization of your ship. You can connect various parts, which snap together at points like legos, to create whatever your mind can come up with. At the beginning of a playthrough, your ships will be small and fairly weak, but as you advance you will be able to fly massive frigates followed by your very own custom fleet.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of ship creation is the physics of thruster placement. Where you put your thrusters actually matters a lot; your ship won't be able to turn very well if you only place them on the back. This also lets you build some funny creations such as ships that travel by spinning. It also means that if you are having trouble progressing, you can completely change the feel of your vehicle by moving or adding a thruster.\n\nCreation aside, the game revolves around the aquisition of currency (called "C") and resource (called "R"). You get both of these basically by blowing up your enemies, the other ship factions. You use your C to buy upgrades and new parts for your fleet, allowing you to take on bigger enemies. If you manage to conquer your whole galaxy, no big deal, the game allows you to jump into a wormhole to enter a new galaxy with your fleet. You can also unlock new factions to play as; all of them utilize different base shapes for their ships, meaning you can create entirely new ideas playing one faction that you couldn't with another.\n\nIf you feel like you've peaked, you can upload your fleet, sending it to other players' games as a powerful opponent called an Agent. This is a really great part of the game, it keeps things challenging and fresh.\n\nOverall, I put this game in the same circle as Spore. You create cool things and share it with others. The game is fun to look at, very colorful, and it has an awesome soundtrack. If you like building things, if you like space, or you like shooting the hell out of ships, just go buy Reassembly.","February 1","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love space, spaceships, and I love games where there's something that lets my creativity run wild. Glad I found this gem!\n\nThis is a game where you control a single ship of faction you choose at the beginning of the game. You can customize it however you want it with the pieces the faction provides. Each faction is unique in a way and none are the same. You fly around, you shoot enemies, gather resources, unlock new modules, grow in power, build up your ship to become an unstoppable destroyer, unlock other factions to play as, and so on.\n\nOf course you don't need to fly alone, you can build up your fleet, or hire pilots from your faction to join you and fly with it. You'll soon be able to conquer the entire galaxy. Also, the galaxy has a fair amount of 'agents', which are fleets that were made by other players. Most of the ones I've seen so far were pretty formidable so if you see a red arrow, you should run until you really feel confident you'll break their ships with ease. Oh, and if you're done playing in that one galaxy you started in? Use a wormhole to fly to another one! This will also upload your current fleet, and chances are, someone, somewhere, on planet Earth, will be soon encountering your very own fleet on their computer. And he'll probably have trouble destroying you.\n\nWhat's truly beatiful about this game is how simple it looks, and how complex it actually is. You could actually consider this game some sort of art. You start in a tiny sector, and you can see pretty early on how dynamic the world is. The AI harvests the minerals, grows in size, expands, it gets better with you, and so on. For example, I once built a single ship that could build stations. I manufactured it from my flagship, kicked it from the fleet so it could be independent, and guess what. Soon enough, when I came back, there were like, 15 stations there, and a whole lot of tiny little fighter ships scuttling around. It was an awesome sight. To be honest, the game kinda looks more organic than scientific. It's like actual organisms battling against each other. Sort of.\n\nWell, either way, if you like space, spaceships, and space battles, if you like being creative, if you like shooting stuff up, if you like seeing your ship grow from a super fast tickling drone to a slow, massive hulking beast of absolute annihilation, if you like sending your enemies to oblivion, then chances are you're going to appreciate this game. It's got a fair amount of replayability, and even though it looks simple, it's really lots of fun.","January 14","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The editor is a snap to do just about whatever you want to do. For example, you can copy your ship and stick the new one on the front of your original ship in less than 5 seconds if you're even halfway decent at using the keybindings. Another good thing is that you can change reassembly from a miminalistic game to a Tron-esque visual style, allowing you to run Reassembly on an old or new computer and use whatever RAM you have. And if you're STILL not convinced, it has mods. Overall, Reassembly gets a 19/20.

Noticed only a couple small bugs so far. Half the time I'm just plotting my next ship or a counter to something that tore my last idea in half. Needs more factions and less skating on ice feeling when flying. Otherwise definately worth it.\n\nPros:\n~ Easy to learn controls and UI\n~ Game mechanics/speed is more or less controlled by the player\n~ Different factions with different building materials offer a different feel.\n~ Custom colors, I hate when you have to look a certain way.\n~ So many different ways to build your fleet! I felt like a kid again watching my legos come alive haha.\n\nThings I wanted to mention that aren't so positive:\n~ Ive noticed some of the stations don't build themselves after capturing the node. They sit idle until I edit them, after I edit they will grow and start to function.\n~ I mentioned the feeling of skating on ice. even with well placed thrusters its still hard to control your ship.\n~ In ine point of the tutorial the game asks you to build a ship with a ship with a factory and then have that ship produce another to complete the cycle to grow your fleet. I love this idea but after you've made the first one spawn they dont really expand they all kinda stay in the same spot :*( I gave them thrusters to move! go kill stuff!

Now officially my favorite chill-out game. It's a strategy game set in a rich living world. Design your ship from scratch using basic building blocks. Pilot it round a large area of space using Newtonian physics - i.e. you carry on moving in the same direction once you have built up speed, without further thrust, and regardless of the direction you are pointing. The game uses a wrap-around map. Harvest resources, trade them to improve your spacecraft. Fight enemies and try to take space sectors from other factions. Recruit allies and form a fleet. Put a factory on your ship and spawn new ships. Travel to other maps using "wormholes". Fight other players' uploaded fleets (not true multiplayer but a contest of designs). You can also use the wormholes to upload your own fleet designs. Unlock new factions to play.\n\nYou could make it a fast and furious battle or a leisurely affair - up to you.

Remember SubSpace? Need I say more? I do? Okay.\n\nAs others have said, this game is extremely addictive. In a good way. The ship editor in itself is hours of lego-style building fun, but add to that a really immersive single-player world with player-made ships and you have a game that is both simple and compelling at the same time.\n\nDefinitely worth the money, tons of replayability. Summarizing my experience as follows:\n\nPros:\n- Great physics / destructable levels, and combat is super fun.\n- Awesome soundtrack.\n- World is huge but not infinite. That's a good thing for a space game.\n- Building ships is surprisingly fun. I'm not usually the type to want to buy a game then spend hours in an editor customizing things. The editor is very featureful and forgiving (undo, redo, copy paste), unlike many other in-game editors out there.\n- Sending your ship into a wormhole uploads your fleet into the ether so they can be run in other player games as the bad guys, Spore-style! In other words, tons of player-made content.\n- If you get sick of your world, fly into a wormhole and explore a parallel dimension instead.\n\nCons:\n- Controls are a little quirky, especially on gamepads. Don't use a gamepad. Occasionally you'll find yourself slamming into an asteroid and getting completely stuck because the "fly backwards" key gets completely rotated and you and up flying into the asteroid and flailing around until you're killed by a passing enemy.\n- Ship editor is missing a MANUAL test flight option to get a sense of the maneuverability of the ship you spent an hour making.\n- Ship editor is missing important info about total mass / total thrust / total energy created which could help to approximate the above stuff. Only total resource capacity is listed-- everything else you have to calculate yourself.\n- NO MULTIPLAYER! The player-made content is fun in SP, but a game like this just begs for multiplayer.\n- Once you've maxed out points, Actual gameplay is 1-dimensional. Mostly consists of flying around and shooting everything you see-- or if you're like me and setup auto-fire, it's just flying around and letting the ship shoot everything for you. You can explore to find new bases, but that doesn't really give you anything.\n\nOn the last two points, I wonder if I'm just misunderstanding some of the game dynamics, but it seems like unlocking bases is just there to occupy your time. I also don't really know if you can ever wipe out another faction. It would be great if:\n\n- You could watch bases expand over time, including size and number of ships, so you actually have more allies flying around. Ditto for enemies that go unchecked.\n- You could actually attack enemy bases and eventually wipe out factions. It would be awesome if each faction actually had a stronghold base you have to kill in order to wipe out an enemy.\n- There were new factions added over time, including to existing regions. Maybe I haven't played for long enough, but it seems like the same factions just exist in perpetuity.\n\nThere it is. Lots of cons because the pros seem obvious to me. It's damn fun! It could be even better if the above things were addressed.","February 22, 2015","true","16.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaotea/recommended/329130/","chaotea","chaotea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaotea/","623 products in account","Reassembly is a fantastic game. In practice its very much a twin-stick-shooter, though it retains a surprising amount of depth for a game which is so simple at its heart.\n\nThere are many things that make this game great, but to simplify things for this small review, and to add information to anyone on the fence on weather to buy it or not, i will put these points into separate short sections.\n\n1) Ship Building.\n\nThe core mechanic of the game, building your ship is both rewarding and a time sink. When building the largest ship in my fleet, i spent 40min before i was satisfied with the end result. But when i was satisfied, i was very satisfied. I glowed with pride as i flew my behemoth through space.\nThe fun doesn't stop there. The ship is made up of lots of different parts, as you can see from the imagery. At first you would be forgiven for assuming that this is simply a method of allowing design flexibility. While this holds true, it opens up an interesting mechanic. You see, every part of the ship is a separate entity. A finished ship is less a single unit, and more a collection of blocks stuck together. In practice this means that slapping hull plating to your ship doesn't simply increase health, but creates an armored point wherever you placed it. Weapons have less health, so placing them in your ship created areas of vulnerability. If you gun is destroyed, you cant fire. If your jets are destroyed you cant move. This means that the layout of your ship is as important as what you put in.\nEqually, your jet engines work as individual units, rather than just giving your ship '+movement speed'. So, if you don't have any jets placed at an angle, you cant turn. If you have no jets on your sides, you cant strafe. No jets facing forwards means you cant reverse. In this same vein, the more boosters you have, the faster you move.\nAll these points turn ship building into a sort of puzzle game. Though one in which the answer is what your preferred gameplay style is.\n\n2) Combat.\n\nWhile general space exploration is a big part of the game, combat is the fly in the soup of game mechanics here. (Not in a bad way, as everyone will want one). Combat is simple as it is deep. At its heart, you pick your target, align guns, and fire till dead. But on a deeper level there's alot which goes into combat. Every ship has a 'core'. This is your command bridge, your heart. When this goes, you die. Until it goes, you will regenerate parts slowly. So when approaching an enemy you look for the quickest way to take out this heart. With the variety of ships on offer, this never gets old.\n\n3) Pacing.\n\nThe game is fantastically paced. Tutorials are done on the fly, so you learn by playing. At the start, you have a small ship. You gain resources by exploring, with small dogfights along the way. You use these resources to improve, and eventually you have a medium ship. Now you start fighting abit more and getting a better income from doing so, whilst supplementing you income with exploration. Then you get a big ship. Now exploration becomes the back seat. Combat is your bread and butter. You fight and fight. After abit, you enter the forth stage of progression. You may have dabbled, but until now you've been focused of improving yourself. Now you build a fleet. Soon your at the heart of a 30 ship strong armada, and fights take on a whole new focus.\n\nThe fantastic thing about this formula of progression is with the unlocks. There are alot of races (8?). You start with only 1. To unlock others you must locate and destroy a ship worth 1000 points (you start with around 300 and grow to 8000 so i found i was doing this around the second / third stage). Each race has some unique items and generally some sort of separate theme to its shared items. This allows great re-playability.\n\n---------------------------\n\nSo, the review summery. This is a great game. Part Space exploration, part space combat, part lego. I'd advise this to alot of people, as there is something for everybody. In particular i'd point people to it who enjoy games with creation elements, such as Spore. If creation isnt your thing, but you like space combat sims, i would still advise this game. The races come with pre-made ships, and the game has the ability to export ships as code. So you can always trawl forums to locate ships.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","February 25, 2015","true","36.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is one of those special games that I will take the time out of my day to write a few words about.\n\nFirst: off I love how there are three different control schemes for the game, you don't realize how important this is untill you try all three. It is exceedingly useful because not all ships will work with one control set up.\n\nSecond: it's an interesting idea to have the universe populated with other players ships. It makes the game fresh. There are some problems with this system, for instance if you make a really weak ship and it is put into someone else's game it's pointless, but for the most part it's good.\n\nThird: the building system, now this system has some major problems, mainly because I have not used it enough to completely understand the logic behind it. I will try to explain the good things it does and the problems it has. It functions like the builder in banjo and kazooie nuts and bolts the difference is it's two dimensional and you have a keyboard and mouse so it isn't frustrating to manipulate It for the most part its balanced, I think it would help if the basic blocks had a cost, for instance I made a cube with the faction you start with and though it's slow it is almost unbeatable because it has so much armor. This could be fixed if the basic parts had a low cost, maybe raise the cap to 10k and make the prices on the other parts higher so it evens out. The biggest problem with the building system is the blocks have to be exactly aligned for them to snap together, basically imagine legos but the pegs are the sizes of needles and you are making giant ships. This ends up with blocks that are a few pixels off of being perfect, this bugs me to death, it's probably the biggest problem with this game.\n\nFourth: The plant faction is too op, it is too easy to make a swarm of ships and to overrun any opponent you may have.\n\nFifth: Another amazing thing this game does well is the different factions have different base blocks, for instance there is a faction that is focused on triangles, this forces you to build intelligently.\n\nThere are many more things in this game that are worth a mention but if you made it to this point I will sum up my opinion on this game with, a resounding recommendation. All though it has it's problems the game as a whole is fun and for 15$ there is almost no reason not to buy it, I have played almost thirty hours of it at the point of writing this reviews, thats fifty cents and hour I have bought triple a games that are less enjoyable than this( looking at you tomb raider, Shadow of mordor, farcry 4, and many others).\n","February 25, 2015","true","96.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's music is calming, the gameplay is smooth (aside from the problems -list to follow), and it's very interesting in the way that the factions each have their own preferred ship pieces. Command Mode is very interesting, and I would love to see an ability to command ships and assign Generals who Command their ships under your order. As well, the ability to force all currently active ships to change to the ship you want, and the ability to force all your Stations to spawn your preferred ships (because flying to each ship/station to edit them individually is impossible), would be great.\n\nHowever, aside from the positive, Reassembly suffers from a few issues that are not just annoying, but are also game-breaking. They aren't too common to come across, but you will find them at some point.\n\nThese problems are:\n1) Losing an entire fleet, which you've spent hours building up, in an instant. This needs to be changed. Reassmbly shouldn't just be about grinding for R (Resources), it should be about building fleets and going into enemy territory to conquer them.\n2) Conquering fleets is great, but what of conquering sectors of space? Hours have been spent flying through a sector and murdering countless fleets only to then have realized that that single sector is still not conquered.\n3) A.I.'s spawn kill users, especially if there are enough powerful enemy ships around. We are not given a buffer time to escape from numerous enemies lingering all over the Stations (when we're spawned in, they just annihilate us in seconds). This problem is infuriating, especially after just Starting up the game from a save and 10 enemies are literally sitting there, waiting for the user. A way to fix this issue (if not to give the user a buffer time) would be to check for the time in which it took for a player to get murdered after their last death, and if it's a very short period of time between deaths, the player should be spawned at a Station a few clicks away.\n\nIf you play the game for long enough, you'll experience these issues and side with my opinion that the game needs these fixes as soon as possible.\n\nBut again, this game is amazing. I would definately recommend it!","February 25, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/techpriestgore/recommended/329130/","techpriestgore","Oedipus Rekt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/techpriestgore/","413 products in account","Reassembly doesn't seem like much on the surface; it could be made in flash, from the looks of it, at least in the screenshots on the store page. It looks and plays like a bunch of other games you might have played, like Void Hunter or even Bubble Tanks. It offers a simple 2-d playing field and unrealistic arcade-style space combat, but I can unequivocally say that this game is the best $15 I've ever spent on Steam, and that isn't hyperbole.\n\nIn Reassembly, you pilot a spaceship. Fly it around, collecting resources from the withering remains of the SPACE PLANTS which sprout from GIANT ASTEROIDS and which reproduce by shooting SEED MISSILES at other asteroids. Filled your tanks with resources? Head over to the local GIANT SPACE STATION and trade them in for CREDITS, with which you can purchase new ship parts, increase the maximum number of useful parts you can slap on your ship, and add other ships to your fleet. You fly around a gigantic galaxy filled with hundreds of sectors and 15 different factions of ships, all at war with you and each other, and each with their own quirks. Go to the north and you might find yourself embroiled in a battle against the strange plant-like faction which sprouts from asteroids, colonizes everything nearby, and rains down a hail of missiles against anything that gets too close. To the east there might be the regenerating red faction, which boast beam weapons and drones and hull plates which reassemble themselves even as you blast them away. To the south you can fight the white rectangular faction, which you can find sprouting off of asteroids deep inside their home sectors. And to the west you might be utterly decimated by the gigantic gunbricks of some other minmaxing schmuck who also bought this game.\n\nYes, you heard me right. If you manage to fight your way to a wormhole and upload your fleet, your fleet (without your control) can turn up in someone else's game to decimate their galaxy or provide fodder for whatever monstrous ships they've been cooking up.\n\nWhich brings me to the gem of this game: the ship designer. Each ship is comprised LEGO-style of multiple blocks with different shapes and functionalities. Each faction has different blocks; the default faction (others are unlocked when you destroy a 1000-point (or more) ship of theirs, while others are NPC-only) favors rectangles and triangles, while others favor diamond shapes or parallelograms or squares. You can design your ship from the ground up; the only thing that has to be included in a design is the tiny 1x1 square which is the command center - this also serves as a sort of last chance, as everything besides this component regenerates after it takes damage, at varying rates. Take a lot of damage but leave with your command center intact and you can regrow your whole ship all in a minute or so, or suck components in with a tractor beam if they or a substitute are floating nearby.\n\nThe gameplay is very sandboxy, but there's enough variety in enemy types and ship designs to sustain it. While I'd be happier with the playable factions having more components to play around with, as it is I've already put quite a few hours into the game and I plan to play a whole lot more. The main objective is to conquer the galaxy by converting each sector to your faction (indicated by color), and this can only be done by destroying the inhabitants of the sector. If you get destroyed by enemy fire (which happens frequently) you respawn back at the nearest ship with a factory component. There are stations scattered across the map which also have a factory component and are vastly powerful, but which lie dormant and deactivated; flying near them and reactivating them not only earns you a lot of credits, but it establishes a foothold for your faction in the sector.\n\nYou can equip your own ships with a factory and build your own fleet (with no maximum cap, I might add) by sucking in resources. As soon as the factory is on your ship, you stop shipping off your resources to every other ship and station with a factory inside tractor range, but start sucking it out of every other friendly ship with no factory in the area, and with those resources you can create a mighty fleet out of any designs you can think of. They'll fly with you, protect you, bring you resources, let you sell them for credits, and generally be your stalwart comrades until you're destroyed, at which point they leave your fleet and you have to start from scratch.\n\nReassembly isn't without faults; an option to turn off the player-made 'agent' fleets would be nice, but overall I am incredibly pleased with my purchase and as far as I'm concerned I've already made my money back and more.","February 22, 2015","true","35.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Recommended for what it is, a space shooter, though it could be a lot more if it involved some objectives or quests or loot or ANYTHING more than just shooting. The ship builder is very cool at the beginning, but eventually gets quite stale when you realize that all designs are  armor on the outside and everything else on the inside. X of this, Y of that, etc. Would be better if there were some proximity bonuses to make the designs require more thought.

It has it's limits, but is definitely fun.\n\nVideo review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dDObkYTzJE&list=UURPe3hzgc7y8NTczf8AffDg\n\nWhat is it?\n\nReassembly is a ship building game. Your goal is to design the most effective warship and conquer the sector. Of course, you're not alone here. There are factions that control territory in the sector. You belong to one faction and most others are hostile, although there are a couple neutral factions.\n\nGamplay consists of designing your vessel using preset parts. In the beginning of the game, you'll most likely spend your time gathering rescources that are generated by the local fauna and bringing it back to your factions stations. You will exchange the rescources for credits that allow you to purchase new ship parts and also alow you to build a bigger ship. Later, you'll likely build a warship capable of using the resources you collect to build your own fleet and wreak havoc on the opposing factions.\n\nYour faction will grow and expand out into the sector and become stronger and you design ships to be put into your fleet. Once your done with one sector, you can enter a wormhole and enter a whole new sector.\n\nPros:\n\n-The ship building system is simple and easy to use. Putting together a ship is as simple as a drag and drop experience.\n\n-The graphics look amazing. Despite being simple polygon graphics, they really are captivating. The light show that a large battle creates is quite a sight to see.\n\n-You have choice about what you will do. You can choose to be anything form a simple harvester to a fearsome dreadnaught.\n\n-Competition within your own faction. As you bring back rescources, your station builds ships. These ships then go out in search of rescources. This will force you farther and farther from the safety of your station. I find that interesting.\n\nCons:\n\n-Despite what the devs may say, there kind of is one way to build a good ship. The armor plating pieces do not count towards the size of your ship. The best way to build a good battleship is to slap on as much armor as you can.\n\n-There is no interaction with the factions. There are no quests, no diplomacy, and no alliances. The only path to victory is conquest.\n\n-Grinding. In order to build a large ship, you will have to harvest a lot of rescources. If you don't build a big ship, you will always dies. Put two and two together.\n\nReally, this game boils down to trying to build the most powerful ship. That's enjoyable, and the exploration (at least before you've seen everything there is to see) can  be quite interesting. I doubt that I'll play this game far into the future, or that (in this current state) it will remain a big thing for long. However, it is still a good game and I've definitely enjoyed playing it.\n","February 27, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The procedurally generated 'galaxy' is full of varied enemies and dangers, and if you run out of baddies, you can dive into a wormhole for a fresh world.  Wormholes have another use, more on that below.\n\nThe main draw of the game though is the ability to build your own ships.  The ship editor is easy to learn, and has enough geometric shapes to allow you to produce anything you want.  The playable factions have different available hull and weapon choices, making each one it's own playstyle.  There is a progression curve, you must spend money earned in the world to unlock new weapons and increase the power cap limiting how much goes on your ship.  It doesn't take too long to max it out though, allowing for huge many-beweaponed designs.  You can also build space stations, it's as simple as building something with no thrusters and at least one factory.\n\nOnce you have some custom ships you like, hit up a wormhole.  Instead of following it to a new world, you can choose to upload a copy of your fleet roster while staying in your own world.  This uploaded fleet will then start randomly appearing in other players worlds.  These are called Agent fleets, and fighting other people's creations that appear in your world can be challenging and exciting.  I've encountered ships that were nearly unbeatable, forcing me to change my ships and tactics in order to prevail.\n\nYou needn't fly solo in your world either, you can equip a factory block and spend resources you collect to spawn AI controlled ships from your collection.  I'm not sure if there's a limit to how many ships you can have at once, I've gotten up to about 15 or so, plus a hundred or so drones if I'm in my Galactica carrier.  Tearing around space with a dozen ships blasting anything you target is super effective.\n\nA caveat to mention is that there isn't any actual multiplayer, which would be great if it were possible, I can see why it would be difficult with all the physics objects that can occur.  Maybe a sequel could pull it off.  Also there are situations that cause the game to slow down significantly, particularly in Spikey Plant sectors once they start firing projectiles all over the place.\n\nMany games out there let you build things, which is fine, but this is one of the few that lets you use and enjoy the fruits of your labor in actual gameplay.  The vector-style graphics are used to good effect and really get my nostalgia going.  I've only owned the game a couple weeks and have dumped almost 50 hours into it.  It's got good music too.\n\nGrade A most excellent game 8000/10","August 26, 2015","true","59.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is a progression curve, you must spend money earned in the world to unlock new weapons and increase the power cap limiting how much goes on your ship.  It doesn't take too long to max it out though, allowing for huge many-beweaponed designs.  You can also build space stations, it's as simple as building something with no thrusters and at least one factory.\n\nOnce you have some custom ships you like, hit up a wormhole.  Instead of following it to a new world, you can choose to upload a copy of your fleet roster while staying in your own world.  This uploaded fleet will then start randomly appearing in other players worlds.  These are called Agent fleets, and fighting other people's creations that appear in your world can be challenging and exciting.  I've encountered ships that were nearly unbeatable, forcing me to change my ships and tactics in order to prevail.\n\nYou needn't fly solo in your world either, you can equip a factory block and spend resources you collect to spawn AI controlled ships from your collection.  I'm not sure if there's a limit to how many ships you can have at once, I've gotten up to about 15 or so, plus a hundred or so drones if I'm in my Galactica carrier.  Tearing around space with a dozen ships blasting anything you target is super effective.\n\nA caveat to mention is that there isn't any actual multiplayer, which would be great if it were possible, I can see why it would be difficult with all the physics objects that can occur.  Maybe a sequel could pull it off.  Also there are situations that cause the game to slow down significantly, particularly in Spikey Plant sectors once they start firing projectiles all over the place.\n\nMany games out there let you build things, which is fine, but this is one of the few that lets you use and enjoy the fruits of your labor in actual gameplay.  The vector-style graphics are used to good effect and really get my nostalgia going.  I've only owned the game a couple weeks and have dumped almost 50 hours into it.  It's got good music too.\n\nGrade A most excellent game 8000/10","August 26, 2015","true","59.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So, basically, I installed this game out of idle curiosity. The following are my impressions from playing it for a couple of hours. If you want to know more about what this game actually IS, I recommend reading some other reviews, or watching a video or two.\n\nPro: It is really fun. Fly, shoot, collect resources, build, shoot some more, re-build from scratch, collect more resources, fly and shoot even more. For me, this game fills a gap I did not know I needed filled, somewhere between StarBound/Terraria (for the block-like, 2D assembly of things) and Space Engineers (for finding yourself trying to build something you couldn't even imagine when you started playing), but actually nothing like either.\n\nPro: Pretty clever take on what you might call "asynchronous multiplayer" -- while playing, you can upload your current ship (or fleet) at wormholes, which then turn up in other player's games (controlled by the AI). Conversely, so called "Agents" lead incursions into your game, using ship designs made by other players. Personally, I enjoy imagining that my creations might be a challenge to someone else... Well, I can dream, at least :D\n\nCon: The UI is a bit rough around the edges; prepare for fixed-width font tutorials and rather simple UI elements. But really, it does not detract much from the fun -- you more or less don't notice after some time.\n\nYMMV: If you do not enjoy building stuff and trying the same things in different ways, this game might not hold your interest for long. However, if you DO enjoy building and trying out things, definitely give this game a try.","August 17, 2015","true","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The tutorial is fine, the achievements are simple, and there are trading cards and workshop DLC. What's not to like about that? There are unlimited possiblities to your ships, and more forgiving deaths, and "Trial-And-Error"s. The soundtrack is quite nice, adding a calming tone to the mood. Though, I could reference a lot of this game to Bubble Tanks. There's almost an endless amount of space (har har because it's set in space) to move around in and tons of "factions" to spar with. And there are these other enemies that are called "Agents". And let me just tell you before you think about your plan- They do not come alone, they're hostile, and will chase you down. However, it's the only way to unlock another faction. And no faction is the same! This game will make you think and strategize about your next move. I have to say, for a game this simple, I think the money was worth it. Definitely recommended.","August 17, 2015","true","21.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's becase those reviews are informed and the people making them have seen all of what the game has to offer, which suffice to say isn't that much.\nThe game feels unfinished, and for a while I assumed it was still in early access, Because it certainly feels like one. Whilst I did enjoy what was there for as long as it kept me interested, there is too much room for improvement that hasn't been expanded into.\n\nI've read their kickstarter, and the majority of things they have promised have not been delivered on, So for now I'm giving it a negative review. It's a decent game, but after around 30 hours what little content there is becomes stale, this isn't acceptable for the price they're asking.\n\nBuilding space ships is certainly fun, but will only tide you over for as long as it keeps you interested, because as far as the base game goes, there is little to no end game other than rofl-stomping anything with massive lag inducing fleets, it feels very unrewarding. There is no reward for becoming the last existing race in the map either, even though that seems like what they're trying to push you towards.\n\nIn the arena however, fighting higher "C tiers" your space ships become less "Ships" and more cubes of death. One of the main points the dev brings up in the video is that "There's no best way to build a space ship" which simply isn't true. Some design philosophies trump others, and function will always win over form, even a mixture of both.\n\nThere's also a many bugs that irk me, and still haven't been fixed after so long. The user interface is still terrible, a nightmare to navigate with no sign of it being improved in the future, with some UI features disapear entirely on ocasion, forcing you to restart your game. Certain factions are unbalanced, some near broken. The AI, despite being relitively smart already, still manages to headbutt itself into asteroids and thrust until either the asteroid or the ship is destroyed (One of my stations was obliterated after my own mining ships tried to force their way through the asteroid it was attached to).\n\nThe ship saving system is also a nightmare, it's entirely possible to lose your ship designs if you're not careful, unless you save or overwrite the ships directly to the disk every time you make a change to the design, there's a high probability that you'll missplace the blueprint in game and possibly lose it. An example for me was when I overhauled one of my designs, forgot to save it once out of the 200 times I needed to, dropped the blueprint in a station manufacturer, and after a while roaming I returned to see both the station and the blueprint destroyed... Now how is that intuitive?\n\nTo top it all off, the modding API is incredibly limited, so it'll be difficult to fix much of this stuff considering the devs have left this as abandonware.\n\nI don't feel like I got my money's worth, but we'll see if things change, maybe the devs will pick up on the game again, because it should never have left early access. One might assume they made a lot of money and moved on, because that's the "cool" thing thing for developers to do these days. Instead of making money to make games, they make games to make money.\n\nEDIT: I'd appreciate if rather than downvoting my review and moving on, that people would explain why they have a problem with it.","January 10","false","46.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I'm not the typical target audience for such a game and thus those who are will proabably not find this review helpful. I also know I'm in the minority on this game. Reassembly has a 94% approval rating. I'm in that 6%.\n\nGiven that approval rating it means that it is the player and not the game. It's probably done well but it is simply not my style of game. I find the controls confusing, the objectives unclear or poorly explained and I have no Earthly idea what is going on. If there is a deeper game here than running around and firing a weapon at targets that move too quickly to be hit, I haven't found it and the game isn't inspiring enough to make me want to look for it.\n\nCome again, Blackadar? What does that mean? Ok, simply put I can't tell what's going on. I see blobs and shapes on screen. It has an art style that just doesn't register with me. I feel like I'm looking at a Jackson Pollock painting in hyper-motion. While I like Jackson Pollock, I don't exactly understand what I'm looking at when I look at that art. I don't understand what I'm looking at when I look at the screen on Reassembly. Now when I combine that with things moving so quickly on screent that I can't hit them, my gameplay options kind of narrow quickly.\n\nActually, they narrow into one thing - uninstall and go find a game I can play. Like Peggle. Or Uno. (it's a joke people, check my profile!)\n\nI guess my ability to effectively control a twin-stick shooter in an abstract art style game is nonexistent. It does, however, have the distinction of being the highest rated game in my collection that I've given a thumbs down to. So if you like the genre this is probably a fine game. If you are like me and you don't enjoy this genre all that much, this won't change your mind.","September 13, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

There's not much point to it, and there's a couple of derpy aspects: firstly the parts aren't all geometrically compatible. For example, the octagonal parts aren't on the same size grid as the square parts. The rectangular parts are on a different size grid again. That's just dumb. Then there's the reason I just rage-quit: I was being single-shot killed in my most armored ship (surrounded by shields and at least 2500 armor) by a weapon (I assume it's a weapon) that I couldn't even see, let alone buy in upgrades. Just a big boom, and my big ship is insta-dead.

You start with very small amounts of building points with which to design your ship. You also haven't unlocked the better tech. It's a cool game but you run out of content pretty quickly and it starts to feel predictable and grindy. Then you kind of max out your ship and that's pretty much it I suppose.\n\nThere seems to be a "multiplayer" mode where you can see the ships of other people on your friends list with the game and automate cpu vs cpu fights in those ships to see who will come out on top. The ship AI is basically to fly directly and as quickly at the opponent as possible so if you have close range weapons you could do pretty well here.\n\nNot that any of it matters. There's not much else to the game. No interesting easter eggs. No special fun ways of being creative. It's pretty bland. A game like this really needs someone to write a story and make some interesting and unique characters to play parts in that story.

There are some creative powerful ships out there but they are few and far between.  In specific i am almost constantly up against an agent called the lasercube, and its ♥♥♥♥ing boring as hell because i essentially have to break out a long range super fast sniping ship and kite it to death or make a clone of it, produce several of them and just out laser cube the laser cube.  This is also annoying.  Of course some faction arent even able to snipe things.  The faction that is orange red yellow has such weak hulls that the laser cube destroys them on sight, and with no long range weapons, and no shields the ROY (red yellow orange) faction is weak as balls against the others.  Its really annoying when my fleet of 7 or more 4000 cost ROY ships just get blown to ♥♥♥♥ by an agent looking at them the wrong way.  In short its a cool game, i do enjoy it, it just frustrates the crap out of me because the factions are unblanced as ♥♥♥♥, all the agents i see are basically cubes or rectangles, and I purchased the game right before the price dropped to $15.  As it stands if the price drops again, or if the game is somehow rebalanced to make cubes and rectangles not the most effcient ship design, or to somehow award ships with greater aestetic appeal more functionality, or really just something to balance all the factions and make them all equally capable of fighting with eachother, then I can recomend the game.  As it stands I would say buy it if you enjoy playing with legos a lot, and if legos weren't one of your favorite toys then this isn't for you as of right now.

Don't let the trolls saying it's good and downvoting anyone saying otherwise tricking you into buying this poorly made and hollow game.","March 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 35 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","5","35","0","0"

After 15 hours of gameplay I felt that I had done everything this game had to offer. It's really fun to build new ships and all,  but if I don't have a purpose it's just meaningless.\n\nThe game is very badly performance optimized, even with a good computer you are playing in slow motion sometimes.\n\nThe game still have alot of bugs. For example crashing and deleting all your save files(!!??)\n\nConclusion: Game is far from done and overpriced. Developer wants to release it in "a couple of weeks". But it's not ready.","February 11, 2015","false","18.6"," 32 of 140 people (23%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","23","32","140","5","20"

There are far too many 5-star reviews here to be taken seriously.\n\nThat being said, here is my review:\n\nThis isn't the slow buildup space opera you're looking for. Now, let me expand on this, because some people can't understand a simple statement that actually has a lot of meaning and shouldn't have to have everything spelled out.\n\n1. It's a live-fast, die faster space 2D shooter with no story arc and a "umm... what am I fighting for?" feel to it. Space Pirates and Zombies is a 2D space shooter, but has a story, coolness, and more. And it was funny.\n2. Too busy! There is so much happening on the screen, you sometimes get lost in all the things spraying this way and that. I'm suprised more people aren't complaining of headaches and seizures.\n2. There is no demo. You buy it, you don't like it, you are SOL. Another Indy rip-off.\n3. Gamepad play was buggy as hell for me. KB+M worked much better, but then I was playing a space shooter with KB+M. /facepalm.\n\nReplies will be deleted. I'm not interested in arguing with rabid fanbois.","February 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 13 of 102 people (13%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","13","13","102","7","0"

I soon found out that those reviews lived up to the positive nature.\n\nStarting out as a single faction to pick, and a basic little ship, you start out a bit causious, trying to gather resources to build your ship up and try to take control of the map with a fleet of your own design along side you.\n\nI have to say that one thing that really impressed me is how optimized this game really is. It might seem like the simple nature of just polygons and other shapes would run smooth, but the effects and lighting that can take place during a large battle between many ships can cause your system to lag. Surprisingly though, it takes several hundred ships in that battle before it really starts to take any effect.","April 20, 2015","true","34.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spent hours, no days building and optimizing spaceship designs. This is a designer's game.\n\nPros:\n-The controls are flexable so you can fly however you want, a very welcome feature in these top down 2D games.\n-The attention to detail in physics is incredible, e.g. if your ship has no off-axis thrusters, it turns really slowly.\n-Open ended - no one strategy to dominate. You can go for speed, armor, shields, range, or build cost. Or you can just be a farmer or a gatherer.\n-Multiple races - just when you think you've optimized a ship series for a particular race, you can play a different race with different abilities and different parts!\n-Really pretty\n-Self-building ships: the trouble with other building games (e.g. StarMade) is that you always have to rebuild your ship after a battle. In this game you don't worry about that, although there are design strategies for having your ship regenerate faster.\n-Good combat AI, so you're not frustrated with the AI pilots being idiotic which breaks many other games.\n-Ability to customize the build sequence of allied ships and stations\n\nWould like to see:\nFleet vs fleet battles with the asynchronous mulitplayer! There are ways to do this with the sandbox but it's not very accessible.\nBetter (maybe customizable) combat AI: e.g. turning the ship to hide damaged armor or shields from enemy fire while it regenerates, or maybe being able to specify a preferred range of engagement.\nBetter non-combat AI: Having AI ships being more exploratory would be nice, otherwise they exhaust their local resources and just end up sitting around.\n\nMy dream is to build an agent fleet that can go into someone else's universe, replicate like crazy and be hugely successful, and completely take it over.

The universe is limited in size, but thats alright since flying over one edge of the map puts you at the opposite side without a teleport or cheap backend trick. Watch out for pirate fleets though; These are, from what I gather, uploaded by other players and are randomly selected, which means that in one universe you may find ships you won't encounter in the next. This uploading is done through anomalies called wormholes that allow you to upload your fleet (designs) or fly to another universe. The latter will generate a new universe for you while you keep your resources, credits and ships.\n\nThe only downside I experienced so far is not being able to destroy core blocks from certain stations. Usually this happens after a few hours of playing and may be memory related, but other than that it plays like a dream. The thing about player created content worries me a bit though, but we'll see how well balanced the game is over time.\n\nA definate recommendation and big thumbs up for this gem.","February 27, 2015","true","75.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiozakiGameplay/recommended/329130/","ShiozakiGameplay","Reii Hishono","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiozakiGameplay/","63 products in account","Let be break this down into a few categories. Graphics, Sound, Story, Controls, Gameplay. I will end this review with my honest opinion after just about 30 hours in game.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe Graphics for this game are simple. And that is what this game's charm is riding on. 2D. It is simple, but because of this, this game has a very good feel to it. Like games of yesteryear. The game, with it's simple graphics. also has much diversity in the way it presents said graphics. From lightly colored tints, to bright shades. With the geometric shapes, the games has as much variety as you give it. And if you allow yourself to become immersed, the game will provide the rest.\n\nSound:\n\nThe sound in this game was surprisingly not what I was expecting. I was expecting simple, "Pyew Pyew ZZST" sounds for the weapons, and the classic "Rocket Burn" sound for the engines. No, Certain weapons all have a different sound. And the further you are from the source of the sound, the softer the sound will be. Zoom out fully, and the sound is just a whisper. Zoom in fully and you get the full range of sound. Do not expect huge Orchestral themes with this game. It keeps it simple, and does a great job at it.\n\nStory:\n\nStory? Simple. You own part of a Galaxy, and you conquer other sections. How, and when you do this. That is for you to decide. Not much else to it. Simply put. Your story is your ship. It is what you make it to be.\n\nControls:\n\nControl are simple. Mouse cursor to aim. Or, if you like, Hit the "R" button to change controls. Personally, I go for the Mouse to aim, and W, S forward and back, A and D to turn. Gives it a more of an old school vibe to it. Makes the game feel more fluid on my end.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay. Oh so simple. Anything shoots you, shoot back. You died? Well then. Try out a new build. In my honest experience, going for pure SP from the very start, helps. Once you reach Max (8000) then you can have some fun. I went for a build similar to current day Naval ships. And let me tell you. If you build to win, using your own creative imagination. You will have some deadly ships. And When you get to build huge huge ships, you become a force even to  other players ships. And, like many others have said, there is no multiplayer in this game. Instead, you get to have other players ships, ported to your game. And, depending on how good they are. You get to feel their wrath.\n\nNow, for my Impression of this game. I have to put it in a few simple words. A breathe of fresh air. Why? I encourage you to see how many good, space sandbox games are out there, that have a flow to it. Yet do not take endless hours to fully experience what this game has to offer. Yet the deeper you dive into this game, the more layers of strategy it takes to overcome. Though that is not to say the game will endlessly become more challenging. It is, as I have said, as you imagine it to be. And that, folks, is where this game has it's core. Some, like me, will find this game charming. And others, will of course, be left feeling a bit empty inside. That is entirely okay. So in the end, You can give this a try, and find out for yourself.","February 28, 2015","true","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can spend hours thinking about where to place your thrusters, armor, turrets, ect.\n\nThe progression isnt bad either- there are 12 factions, each with many parts to unlock.  Its hard to describe how different it feels going from a faction that lets you make things out of squares to a faction that forces you to use rhombuses instead.\n\nFighting player made fleets is also pretty awesome.\n\nThe minigame of "Can you make a ship for X points that beast everyone elses ship that they spent X points on" is actually really interesting and deep as well.  Watching the AI pilot your ships is quite interesting (though its a shame there isnt a more formalized way of pitting your designs against specific friends' ships).\n\nThis game is basically a better, more fleshed out version of the spore cell stage.","February 26, 2015","true","64.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you get big enough, the roles switch. You get to a point where you get a part which lets you spawn ships. your resources now go to making your own fleet which follows you and fights for you. Those ships will also bring you the resources they collect, allowing you to make more. If you put enough storage on your ship, you can even spawn the massive stations which intially spawned you in the begining.\n\nI love the game and it never gets old. There is always a new ship or even fleet to fight. Just as you think you have built the most powerful ship, an agent comes in and kills you and your fleet in seconds. This makes it so that you have to tweek your own design in order to compete with the new foe.","March 5, 2015","true","38.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ship designing utilizes a clean workspace that is powerful. Amazing, coloful visuals and an epic electronic/ambient soundtrack also make this a great experience.

It sucked me in completely for a couple of weeks. I'd look up at the clock and think omg it's been 6 hours! I'd go to work the next day on 5 hours sleep. It stirred my gamer blood! The ship building freedom is top notch. You build any kind of ship you want particle by particle and there are lots of smart, handy features in the ship building editor to save time. You can hold down the mouse and drag it across an area to select multiple components or you can just double click one piece and everything attached to it will be selected.\n\nA quick ship building tip is to just build one side of the ship, say a wing, select all the pieces then hit c to copy. Move the cursor to a blank part of the screen and hit v to paste, then hit m to mirror (to invert the selection). Now you can just attach that perfectly mirrored section onto the opposite side of the ship if you need symmetry like for wings.\nSymmetry is also important in placing your thrusters. You are in space so your ship isn't going to stop moving unless it crashes into something...or you put thrusters pointed in the opposite direction to the direction you're traveling in so you can break!\nAlso each different playable faction has some unique pieces to build with. Sometimes the minor differences aren't obvious, like where pieces don't have as much mass as other factions or they have slightly higher armor, but when you stack all those pieces together into a ship then the net values really make a difference in speed, toughness, or resource carrying capacity. You'll want to look at the stats on the ship pieces closely if you're into ship building.\nIf you're not into ship building there are premade ships available with each faction that you can use and just modify to your taste.\n\nThe game is beautiful to look at and very organic. To me it looks more like the world under a microscope filled with living, evolving organisms than it does a space frontier. Much like organisms, the ships actually create children. You can set a creation queue for yourself once you have a factory as part of your design. But you can also go into command mode by hitting tab and click on an allied vessel that has a factory and drag child designs into their queue so you begin to shape the future of your factions expansion without actually managing the execution. Just hit tab again to go back into pilot mode and go on your way. The allied ship you just programmed will now create what you set for it via the AI.\n\nOnce you've got your perfect fleet together you can find then fly into a wormhole. You will be given an option to follow it or stay. If you stay a parallel version of your fleet will upload to infect another player's galaxy through one of their wormholes while you remain where you're at with your original fleet. I just really wish there was some way of knowing how successful these invasions were, like a scoring system players could access to get some sense of how good your designs were.\n\nThe tournament mode doesn't pit you against other players. It just lets you test your own ships against your own designs and a small selection of premade designs. I would love to see a true tournament mode where you download player agents and test your ship against theirs with scoring. The game lacks true player interaction in real time but atleast we can see other player's creations as they come into our own galaxy as enemy agents controlled by the AI.\n\nUnfortunately I do think there is a balance issue that needs to be addressed with faction 4. You will eventually find certain enemy agents that are typically oblong, travel at high speed, and shoot enormously long particle rays at you at range even from off of the screen! That's faction 4. They almost made me rage quit because they really get too many advantages, but I perservered and went back to the design editor. Their weakness is maneuverability. Their big bad weapon of choice is not turreted so the whole ship has to turn to target you with the death ray. This is not a huge disadvantage because their ships are inordinately fast but if you build a ship that can quickly side step their line of fire and either swarm them or ram them so that they can't turn into you then you can take them down...if you can catch them. Trapping them against asteroids is a typical ploy. Really though, no other faction gives nearly so much trouble...\n\nThe only other criticism I have is lag. No it's not really just a hardware issue. I play many other games where it's not an issue. The devs themselves have stated that they've worked really hard on the optimization but the fact is there comes a point where there are so many collisions going on in the galaxy that it can be taxing. I have an i5-4670, 8G ram, nvidia GTX 780 so my hardware is good. But I like faction 2 whose strength is cultivating resources and building up a fleet really quickly. Once I push out a bunch of ships that then create their own AI controlled child ships, the game has alot to track. The devs said to go into options and lower the physics updates per second value so I'll try tweaking that more. But it kind of makes me want to put the game aside now and come back later, maybe playing a different faction and not use a swarming strategy. If you get lag you can also follow a wormhole to a fresh universe, but that too can start to get repetitive.\n\nThe fresh content is really about fighting other player designs as enemy agents enter your galaxy. I hope the devs continue to work on the lag issue (maybe instancing parts of the playing field to lower the amount of AI activity needed as the game progresses). I'd also like to see them expand on player interaction by scoring invasions, and maybe add some simple tiered goals with rewards for flipping sections of your galaxy to your faction.

It's a pretty looking, lego-like game, that lets you build your own ship from a measly fighter to an unstoppable jauggernaut capital ship. There are quite a few unique factions to unlock and build with that are all pretty fun to play as with their own special weapon types and building blocks.\n\nAlthough I full heartedly reccommend this game I think it's important point out some gripes.\n\nEnd Game Is kinda boring\n-Reassembly is one of those games where you become so powerful that there simply isn't strong enough competition to personally test your work of art against. There are some fleets you can battle that can be difficult but often times they can be really easy.\n\nFaction Economy and territyory system isn't fleshed out\n-Gaining and losing territory seems very ambiguous and pointless beyond %100 conquering the map, which is tedious and time consuming. There doesn't seem to be any benefit of having territory. You're supposed to give resources to ship building factories that will then go out and gain territory, but this is kind of un-engaging past bringing the materials in.\n-There aren't really any "capital" territories that faction forces are strongest at. Having these would bring in some depth to the world, adding difficulty and strategy to your campaign. Attack the capital of a faction and cripple it's economy so it can't reinforce other territories as easily. Some factions have cargo ships that don't really do anything but get killed by you for some free money. Giving them something to do that has benifits would be amazing for this game.\n\nBeyond anything I've mentioned the game is a great time! If you're even slightly considering picking this up, do it! Especially if it's on sale.","August 5, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could (and probably already have) spend hours just designing and testing out different ships. I've played it for hours and there are a number of things I really like, but I'm going to focus on the areas that need improvement for this review:\n\nMy biggest complaint is the lack of end-game goals. Once you reach the upper limits of ship size and amass a big fleet, there's pretty much nothing that can stand in your way and the game becomes trivial. At that point, even if there wa s a win condition, there's no real reason to keep playing.\n\nOne of the other areas I'd like to see improvement in is the various factions. The first faction, Terran, has a lot of different technology to play with, but most other factions only have a few different weapon types, etc. This made playing the factions I'd unlocked less fun than I had hoped.\n\nFinally, the ship AI leaves a bit to be desired, specifically their ability (or lack thereof) to navigate around obstacles. For a game set in space, the world is densely populated, and I've frequently had issues with AI ships getting stuck behind asteroids or accidentally getting latched onto other ships (the more irregularly shaped ones). Even trying to turn your own ship around in similar situations can be difficult with the default control scheme (mouse rotates ship).","July 24, 2015","true","66.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The simplistic parts that you get to design your ship with is all you need to create the coolest looking space-ships this side of the galaxy. It's not as simple as "plug the device on and go", you need to build your ship CORRECTLY or it won't maneuver through space! Don't have enough retro-thrusters? You better hope you can back off the enemy fast enough by turning (and not dying from losing your back end). Didn't think you needed thrusters to turn? Guess you're going in one direction infinitely. It's a constant failure zone, and I just LOVE IT!\n\nIt's a very grindy game, so if you don't like grinding, I would certainly stay away. And the sandbox mode isn't very intuitive either. I tried to build something in the constructor (in the sandbox mode), and I didn't even get things to build with. Don't get fooled with sandbox mode, it isn't a free build-any-ship-for-free mode @.@ If you don't mind grinding as you play different factions (have to unlock them), then you'll find HOURS upon HOURS trying new designs and seeing if they stack up with the best.\n\n24 hours of Gameplay later:  This game is even better!  Again the game is grindy, but the different factions (without mods) force you to build your ships in different patterns. Have a good design for faction 1 (Terrans)? You're not using it on Faction 4 because there are no long-triangle blocks! The only downside with ship-building, is when you test your ship against others' you need to fight these really cheap min-maxed ships that do nothing but fly backwards when your ship catches up with every default ship in the game; actually it's the CPU attacking the other ships, but it's still cheap tactics that win.\n\nAlso, the sandbox mode isn't as convoluted as I first thought. I can create any ship I want with the right commands, and even see the default ship palettes for each faction. Unfortunately this isn't explained very well and you need a tutorial outside of the game to understand which commands do what (and that Faction 1 is actually Faction 8 for example). You can still build any ship you want in your save game, but the sandbox is very misleading (not much of a sandbox :/ More of a programmer's blank sheet of paper).

There is no cloaking, emps, damage differences between shield and armor, and no afterburners. Just to highlight a few things. Balance is questionable. No real economy outside of combat, trade maybe?

The part shapes are just occasionally odd enough that getting things to line up becomes part of the fun.\n\nTest designs by letting them autopilot versus random other designs.  Center of gravity and healing rate are important.  Some ships are practically a huge gun with a seat and thrusters strapped onto it!\n\nI spent hours not even playing - just designing a ship and watching it play against other designs in the test phase.\n\nOnce you are happy with a design (or just want to shoot something yourself) go in and harvest resources where the bad guys are, which also allows building up a fleet to team up against opponents.  Building a fleet is pretty cool - although they are something like a herd of cows...  not too smart and they get stuck in the weeds sometimes.  Playing the fleet dynamics is a whole game by itself!\n\nThe flight is very space-like where you have to oppose thrust to slow down, which makes it feel very swimmy (I think why they say welcome to the tide-pool).  In that regard it feels a little like Spore's bacterial stage, only flying takes much more concentration.\n\nReplay value is sky-high, as optimizing ship designs at all size allowances allows starting over and trying new ideas.\n\nAlso, the game feels very different than other games because you have complete control how your ship handles (although once it's damaged and your engines have fallen off it will handle very differently until it heals again over several seconds, relatively fast).  Trying to control a damaged ship reminds me of Robocraft, though this game is much more twitchy.\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nIf I had to pick a favorite game so far in 2015, this might be it.  The gameplay is straightforward.  There are always more things to want to try out, which takes time to get there and try them.  And Space feels alive.  This is more of a tadpole simulator than a space game.","June 17, 2015","true","104.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/richter_carmine/recommended/329130/","richter_carmine","Sleeper >v>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/richter_carmine/","107 products in account","The game I've been looking for. Reassembly is easy to understand, rough to master, with multiple different ship construction strategies that may or may not work, whether alone or together.\nYour objective is to collect resources to upgrade and build your ship(s), eventually providing your ship with a factory block that can spawn a fleet for you. Enemies are generated off of other players' designs, copied through the use of wormholes, keeping you however from ever encountering real players, just AI versions of their fleets.\n\nPros:\n-No frame drops, I've rarely been lowered in video quality throughout my time playing\n-Expansive maps, plenty of sectors generated swiftly with new stations to capture and factions to fight\n-Comfortable building interface, with useful tools like mirror and copy and paste to make everything much faster to build, putting you in the fight sooner, plus a lot of weapons and tools to make specialized ships like drone swarm spawners, rocket carronades, snipers, etc.\n-Nice artstyle. Very minimalistic, but it is still nonetheless fun to watch your ships "reassemble" as the new parts are traced and come to life in the middle of a battle\n-No loading screens. Literally none.\n-Test feature, which pits your newly made ship against another of the same value to test its strength in a real battle, before you try and fly a space dumpster into a battle and waste time\n\nCons:\n-Slightly repetitive soundtrack. Good music, but it seems to loop a lot. Maybe I'm just playing too much :P\n-Instructions and controls must be looked up a couple times to learn how to do everything (ie Toggle hud, commision fleet ships, set child cycles for your fleet's ships, etc)\n-My biggest problem: Ship control. Most games like this have the WASD keys stay in a locked position of North, West, South, East. This game, however, orients control around your crosshair, meaning you have to constantly check which way your shape is facing and reorient yourself to fly properly. Very hard to get used to.\n\nAll in all, I'm giving it a 8/10. Fantastic game, and I highly recommend it, I would just like to see some new features implemented and that movement control thing given a second option.\n\nThings I want to See Implemented:\n-Co-op multiplayer. Allow a friend to join you in your faction and grow alongside you. Perhaps a combining force of an intelligent gunship and bot spawning mother-ship, I thought this would make a fantastic duo.\n-New music\n-New weapons and hull parts/utillity pieces, some ideas are:\n> Repair drone. Accelerates rebuild speed.\n> Cloaking system\n> Repulsion/Attraction blocks, for pulling in enemies into short range weapons or pushing them away from a long range ship\n> Kamikazee drones. Name says it all\n> Barrier construction. Some kind of attachment that uses resources to build walls for defense, or maybe even dispense some kind of acid or magma to ward off pursuers.\n> Parasite drone. A drone that embeds into the core of a ship and changes its faction, rebuilding it and putting it in your fleet, maybe even copying the schematic into your inventory\n\n\nSo those are my ideas and reviews of the game, hope it helped and you agree!","June 18, 2015","true","97.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even now, after I know it's a space game, it still has that organic look.\n\nThis is a great game. It runs very well on an older laptop, and when things get too intense with the graphics, the program simply steps down speed rather than crashes. The design interface for the ship editor is very well done and you can zoom in and out. It has a lot of things you can use, but just enough so you do not get overwhelmed from too much inventory to choose from.\n\nPiloting your ships is a little tricky, since it involves the cursor and the keyboard and even then you have settings to choose from. My best analogy of piloting a ship in Reassembly is like riding a horse, where you use rein to control the speed and steer your steed.\n\nThe conquer the universe mode is pretty straightforward and you got lots of time to build up resource. The tutorial helps you get things rolling though I was hoping for more, like for example what exactly am I scooping off these asteroids? To date, I've never been wiped off the map for being too slow. If you beat an agent, you unlock a faction to play.\n\nTHe sandbox mode? Okay, that's the first real negative on this game. I'm old enough to have played games that involved you using complex commands in a text editor  to create the scenerio before the game began, so let me tell you I've never seen a sandbox mode that involved command language since the 1980s. This would have been acceptable for the 1980s but this is the 21st century, and most computer users are not programmers. They would expect an Activision-esque style of interface where you select number of players, difficulty level, type of victory scenerio and so on. AFter seeing a dazzling UI, asking the user to create a sandbox match using command line languages gives this game a unfinished look. It's not a deal breaker. I got more than my money's worth out of it, but I would have loved to see what the sandbox mode was like.\n\nMy verdict? Worth it, lot of replayability value and you will have hours of fun designing things and watching them go blooey. Just skip the sandbox mode.","September 1, 2015","true","49.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally don't like fps or space shooter games which looks like this one.\n\nI pick this game to try couse it was offering that u can create your own space ships.  I saw that not only you create your own vessel but you create an echosystem actually. In this game everything acts like living beings they grow, they sperad and claim territories. You are the lader of the echosystem. You design how your faction will do acually by altering the designs. Game AI uses your designs if you have suitable one for a stuation.  If you don't, they have their own designs. Your resource also a space plant which is growing spreading around like your faction.\n\nYou start with a pre-designed faction with its own unique blocks and weapons. Simply you gather resources and grow to be better, stronger and dominate a huge map which is infinite like with its wormholes. You design your own ships with limited blocks at start and vary them by researching more which gives you like infinite combinations. Game also helps you with this by its pre designed ships.\n\ni strongly reccomend this game if you define yourself like me\n\n\n\n\n","August 23, 2015","true","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sit down. We're here because we care about you. Now we need to talk to you about your problem. Pick one from the following list.\n- You bought Reassembly.\n- You have not bought Reassembly.\n\nThis game is that sandbox you played in as a kid. While most people were playing GI Joes and army men, you were pretending that firetruck was a star destroyer. That Tonka truck was a Carrier. This game is that sandbox, and that Carrier is real.\n\nAnything in your mind can be made in this game. Do you want to build unrealistic space gods that spin at 2000mph while sneezing death? Do it. Maybe you want to build a true to design Star Destroyer, or the BattleStar Galactica? I've seen CIS Control ships, the Serenity, a Borg fleet, and a literal pirate ship with tiny whale escorts. If the blocks fit, you can build it. And the blocks always fit(not).\n\nAs for actual mechanics, this game starts you out as a tiny little fighter. You destroy enemy ships, reactivate defunct friendly stations and gather resources. These resources allow you to upgrade your ship, until one day you too can build a battlecruiser the size of a small moon. You can also produce your own fleet, which can in turn produce its own fleet or follow you into combat or both. There are tons of ways to play the game, and little things you will find that feels like your own little trick.\n\nTL;DR: This game is too much fun. You will get addicted. You will stop playing, and then come back and splurge another 50 hours on it after you think you forgot about it.\n\nP.S. To whomever has been on the receiving end of my 190+ ship fleet dumps the last two days, I'm sorry, but I need your galaxy.

This game is quite enjoyable, relaxing experience. Take your time to build ships however you want for whatever roles are needed - go out and expand your territory, or if you are like me and favor the Farmer faction simply populate surfaces with plants and watch as your fleet size grows. Of the very few down sides to this game is a lack of detailed instructions on the part functions ingame (you basically have to memorize them, learn from guides and videos posted by others). Some in-game mechanics are also lacking documentation (such as how to restrict building of ships). All the lack of documentation issues generally don't add up to much problem once you have played a faction for some time however.\n\nOverall a very good game and an enjoyable experience.

I saw that not only you create your own vessel but you create an echosystem actually. In this game everything acts like living beings they grow, they sperad and claim territories. You are the lader of the echosystem. You design how your faction will do acually by altering the designs. Game AI uses your designs if you have suitable one for a stuation.  If you don't, they have their own designs. Your resource also a space plant which is growing spreading around like your faction.\n\nYou start with a pre-designed faction with its own unique blocks and weapons. Simply you gather resources and grow to be better, stronger and dominate a huge map which is infinite like with its wormholes. You design your own ships with limited blocks at start and vary them by researching more which gives you like infinite combinations.

The test option on the design screen is probably the truest test of them though.

This mechanic is very well implemented and the game is really fun, flying round space blowing stuff up really never gets old. The building ship feature is very, very good (it could do with some fixs and some more variations), everything on the ship is down to you if it is too slow thats your faut (add more thrusters) or its just getting smashed against flagships and agents (add hull and shields) you can change it and upgrade it to fix these problems. Everytime you die there is something you can do to imporve the ship, you learn from every mistake and can adapt to it.

I'm going to give it a Thumb Up because it was initially fun, but it is borderline Thumbs Down.\n\nI initially loved this game. I played a ton of S.P.A.Z. and this game is a lot like that only with more customizable ships. It stared off great. I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me and realized I need to upgrade my ship. Grinded a bit and started playing around with my own designs. Went back a killed the guys giving me problems and started exploring a bit. Repeated those steps for a while until I ran into an Agent and they are my biggest issue with the game. They are horribly unbalanced. They absoluted decimated me. It isn't a problem to have hard boss like entities that you neeed to prepare for, but these guys become more powerful everytime they kill you and everytime you get in range they spawn more support ships and you either end up feeding them to the point that they are basically unbeatable and you have to flee to a new map or you have to go and grind until your ship is fully upgraded and you have an entire fleet of fully upgraded ships just to stand a chance and it just becomes a chore because there are multiple Agents per map and they all need a fully upgraded leet to defeat. At least the 10 or so I encountered. I was forced a few times to flee the map via the wormholes because they were just destroying everything I had only to warp into a new map, which makes you lose your fleet in doing so btw, only to find an Agent right there that was even more powerful than the one I just ran from and now I have no fleet and no supporting station network. It really killed my desire to play. If the Agents had a set number of ships that never increased or they were more balanced to the level of the player, I think I would enjoy the game more and actually come back and play it.\n\nAfter getting into the game, it just feels like it's either a grind or you are getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you. Maybe some people enjoy a game like that, but I prefer a game that is challenging, but fair without hours of grinding. I also don't see a point to the game other than the grinding and killing. SPAZ had a story and a purpose for the grind, this doesn't seem to.","August 27, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Deep emergent game play that's immensely gratifying and dusted with sci-fi references to movies, TV and space opera novels. The most perfectly suited geekery I've ever experienced. :o)\n\nThe 'tournament' feature is basically Gratuitous Space Battles, with easier controls, where you can pit anyone's designs against each other in a space arena. The over-all experience of the main game is basically what Spore should have been; expanding out smoothly from the tidal pool stages. One of the few things that sometimes irked me is when friendly ships zip in and nab your loot from under your nose. I would have been tempted to make this game entirely RTS oriented, with truly conserved resources (shared within your faction). But the design is definitely spot-on as it is: putting you in the action and keeping the simulation scale (almost) within the capabilities of (my) PC hardware.

This game is absolutley amazing. It's visuals are beautiful and the way the game is set up and what you do is so simple, yet so cool and creative and great. You build a fleet of ships using the recourses you are limited to. You can get currency and buy more blocks or weapons. You can also buy this thing to be able to add more blocks and weapons to your ship. You fly across the galaxy reactiving your factions stations or whatever they are. There is no story to it, it's just taking out other ships, reactivating stations, getting currency and buying stuff. Once you're done reactiving all the stations in that part of space, you can go through a wormhole to go to somewhere different. But you can select new factions with unique blocks and weapons. It's just so unique and amazing. This game is definitley worth $15.","September 13, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The simplistic parts that you get to design your ship with is all you need to create the coolest looking space-ships this side of the galaxy. It's not as simple as "plug the device on and go", you need to build your ship CORRECTLY or it won't maneuver through space! Don't have enough retro-thrusters? You better hope you can back off the enemy fast enough by turning (and not dying from losing your back end). Didn't think you needed thrusters to turn? Guess you're going in one direction infinitely. It's a constant failure zone, and I just LOVE IT!\n\nIt's a very grindy game, so if you don't like grinding, I would certainly stay away. And the sandbox mode isn't very intuitive either. I tried to build something in the constructor (in the sandbox mode), and I didn't even get things to build with. Don't get fooled with sandbox mode, it isn't a free build-any-ship-for-free mode @.@ If you don't mind grinding as you play different factions (have to unlock them), then you'll find HOURS upon HOURS trying new designs and seeing if they stack up with the best.\n\n24 hours of Gameplay later:  This game is even better!  Again the game is grindy, but the different factions (without mods) force you to build your ships in different patterns. Have a good design for faction 1 (Terrans)? You're not using it on Faction 4 because there are no long-triangle blocks! The only downside with ship-building, is when you test your ship against others' you need to fight these really cheap min-maxed ships that do nothing but fly backwards when your ship catches up with every default ship in the game; actually it's the CPU attacking the other ships, but it's still cheap tactics that win.\n\nAlso, the sandbox mode isn't as convoluted as I first thought. I can create any ship I want with the right commands, and even see the default ship palettes for each faction. Unfortunately this isn't explained very well and you need a tutorial outside of the game to understand which commands do what (and that Faction 1 is actually Faction 8 for example). You can still build any ship you want in your save game, but the sandbox is very misleading (not much of a sandbox :/ More of a programmer's blank sheet of paper).

It's a game that invites you to show off your creativity and ingenuity, and really makes you proud of your progress and what you've achieved no matter how far into the game you are, even if you're already been there in a previous save. Easy to learn, hard (but extremely fun) to master. Well worth the 15 bucks, would highly recommend.","May 25, 2015","true","127.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also addicting, because you can just make a hole bunch of unique ships and get a big difference in each ship. Add a bunch of factions to it, and you get a huge variety of ships that you can make. The games environment is also beautiful.\nThe only problem that i have with this game, is the price. Its not bad, but it could be lessened to 10$ tops.\n\nAll in all, the game is worth the bucks. 9/10\n(would recommend getting it on sale tho :P )","May 27, 2015","true","241.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Make a ship, blow up other ships, farm resources, make an army, use the aforementioned army to destroy other ships and make your faction inevitably powerful and build super destroyers, for the sake of entertainment.\n\nBut it's so much more than that, it has beautiful graphics (even on lower settings), doesn't destroy your framerate, allows free building of pretty much whatever you want, in terms of ships / stations, the only part of this game that I feel is lacking is in both the modding and sandbox areas.\n\nThey could use a little work, not for me, but for those inexperienced in the usage of command lines.\nAside from that, if you like action/exploration, then take up this game, i've had 90+ hours on it and I'm still not bored.\n\n^^","June 27, 2015","true","188.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy it! I've owned the game for a week and have already play 16 hours. As many other reviewers have said this game is very addicting. Starting as a small ship the size of a VW Bug, and then destroying other faction's ships and harvesting resources to become a ship the size of an aircraft carrier or 5. On top of that, your main ship can ♥♥♥♥ out other ships that you've designed, which will attack what you've locked on to.\n\nAnd once you've had enough with one faction, you've unlocked others you can now start a new campaign with.

It has high replay value and if you want 100% completion on any one game it's tough as nails.  It's exactly what I look for in a video game.

The entire map look wonderful, and the colors a vibrant and fantastic! I've seen a space age paradise, and I dont think I'll stop playing for a long long time. Second thing I have to say, Some of you fellow players have some tough builds, looking forward to fighting more!\n\nAll shock and awe aside... THis game is great! You make custom ships, which then form into a custom fleet, which you use to dominate your quandrant of unlimited space. Succeed in that? Well, good things theres wormholes to new guardrants! Unlockable factions (by fighting them), which grant new games with different difficulties, builds, and weapons!\n\nI was and am a fan of Robocraft because of its custom capabillity and design. However, robocraft in 2D space? YES.\n\nI would like to thank the Devs, the players (even the ones whose Agents gave me a tough time), and everything that lead to this game's exsistance. 10/10 will dominate the galaxy again!","August 29, 2015","true","60.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll often try to escape ennemy fire so you reassemble before blowing up.\nI love the score too, it's the kind of music I don't feel like muting it.\n\nThe interface is counterintuitive at times, but it's almost top notch. There are some glitches and some elements are obscure, for instance, assigning ships to spawners and the mecanic of it all.\nThere are not much of a clear goal as it is an open world and it feels right the way its done, The starting objectives starts as a nice tutorial, but I guess I need more time to grasp the whole picture.\n\nAll in all, it's a must have space shooter/explorer.

"Completing the game" is quite fast, but the achievements really extend the things to do there.

To me, this is where the value of the game is at and where the vast majority of my invested time has gone.\n\nSo if you get the game, I suggest you play with it for an hour or two, "Test" your designs against other ships and then google for "Reassembly forums" and find the online community and therefore the tournaments. That will take you down an amusing road that you can indeed spend 100+ hours on, as I have. I really enjoy designing and testing ships.\n\nPeople who should probably not buy this game:\nAnyone looking for a long lasting, interesting single player experience that does not involve building ships for tournaments. While this game does have a roguelike(?) portion to it, and I suppose some people may get dozens of hours of enjoyment out of it, there's really not much to it. You fly around and "conquer the galaxy" but the mechanics of doing this basically involves flying around and shooting everything in your custom ship, which IS entertaining for a few hours, as you grow and tweak the design, but I felt that part got old fast. It's just not very interesting. Maybe if the galaxy had more actual strategy to it or an overarching metagame... I mostly just play as a faction enough to unlock all the parts and then go design ships for possible tournament play because the galactic battles seem so droll.\n\nStill, I can't NOT recommend it considering I've put over 100 hours into a game that I think I pay $9 for. This game probably won't knock your socks off but it's neat and interesting and not a bad way to spend a few bucks if your interests are at all like mine.\n\nOh, search YouTube for the tournaments too.","January 1","true","139.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun, the UI isn't too bad, it's nice creating ships where you have to worry about thruster position, centre of mass (both easily done with a symmetrical ship), if the ship has enough thrusters to maintain a decent speed (space friction is in effect here) or rotate rapidly enough (my main issue when designing). But then once all is said and done there's an issue: Once you get good enoguh at ship design and you've tried it with all the factions (or all the ones you like) there's nothing to really do. The starting grind is boring, running around demolishing every AI ship, agent or not, is boring. One well designed ship helmed by a player can and will crap on everything.\n\nI feel one thing this game needs is a true multiplayer to keep it fresh for longer. As it stands, once you have a death ship (my antimatter dreadnought comes to mind) there's no way in hell anything is ever gonna kill you. Tournament mode, this game's "multiplayer", is pretty boring. It's two player made ships fighting, but nobody has control of them, you have to hand it over to the ♥♥♥♥-poor AI that seem to have two modes: 'I have drones so run away and launch them', or 'CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE!', which managed to lead to the aforementioned dreadnought getting demolished because it refused to stay at maximum range where it wouldn't get chewed up by lasers and the like.\n\nAnyway, getting back to my point, multiplayer would really benefit it. A proper multiplayer in the proper game, not some multiplayer tournament-style thing. Teams or against would be personal preference because that would give an actual challenge once you get past that critical point of 'every AI ship is killed in moments'\n\nYes, I know that multiplayer would require a lot of work, but it feels like a game that *really* needs it. It seems almost designed for it, but it just doesn't have it.","December 26, 2015","true","47.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And there is a thing called agents wich are playermade ships who spawn in your map to haunt you.)\n-No control over spawned ships. In command mode you can sell or buy allied ships but you cannot control them as in sending them in a direction, generally the spawned ships will follow you and defend you at their best ( wich is up to you on how you build them ;) )\n\nSorry for any mistakes and poor english\nHope you will buy this game and have as much fun as I do playing it\n\nTo the Dev: If you ever read this=> I will Buy Reassembly 2 early acces or even kickstart if you add a multiplayer/co-op!!","August 20, 2015","true","83.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even now, after I know it's a space game, it still has that organic look.\n\nThis is a great game. It runs very well on an older laptop, and when things get too intense with the graphics, the program simply steps down speed rather than crashes. The design interface for the ship editor is very well done and you can zoom in and out. It has a lot of things you can use, but just enough so you do not get overwhelmed from too much inventory to choose from.\n\nPiloting your ships is a little tricky, since it involves the cursor and the keyboard and even then you have settings to choose from. My best analogy of piloting a ship in Reassembly is like riding a horse, where you use rein to control the speed and steer your steed.\n\nThe conquer the universe mode is pretty straightforward and you got lots of time to build up resource. The tutorial helps you get things rolling though I was hoping for more, like for example what exactly am I scooping off these asteroids? To date, I've never been wiped off the map for being too slow. If you beat an agent, you unlock a faction to play.\n\nTHe sandbox mode? Okay, that's the first real negative on this game. I'm old enough to have played games that involved you using complex commands in a text editor  to create the scenerio before the game began, so let me tell you I've never seen a sandbox mode that involved command language since the 1980s. This would have been acceptable for the 1980s but this is the 21st century, and most computer users are not programmers. They would expect an Activision-esque style of interface where you select number of players, difficulty level, type of victory scenerio and so on. AFter seeing a dazzling UI, asking the user to create a sandbox match using command line languages gives this game a unfinished look. It's not a deal breaker. I got more than my money's worth out of it, but I would have loved to see what the sandbox mode was like.\n\nMy verdict? Worth it, lot of replayability value and you will have hours of fun designing things and watching them go blooey. Just skip the sandbox mode.","September 1, 2015","true","49.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of my gems in my collection.\ni am a strategy/survival/creative game lover. I like games like minecraft, terraria.  I personally don't like fps or space shooter games which looks like this one.\n\nI pick this game to try couse it was offering that u can create your own space ships.  I saw that not only you create your own vessel but you create an echosystem actually. In this game everything acts like living beings they grow, they sperad and claim territories. You are the lader of the echosystem. You design how your faction will do acually by altering the designs. Game AI uses your designs if you have suitable one for a stuation.  If you don't, they have their own designs. Your resource also a space plant which is growing spreading around like your faction.\n\nYou start with a pre-designed faction with its own unique blocks and weapons. Simply you gather resources and grow to be better, stronger and dominate a huge map which is infinite like with its wormholes. You design your own ships with limited blocks at start and vary them by researching more which gives you like infinite combinations. Game also helps you with this by its pre designed ships.\n\ni strongly reccomend this game if you define yourself like me\n\n\n\n\n","August 23, 2015","true","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm going to give it a Thumb Up because it was initially fun, but it is borderline Thumbs Down.\n\nI initially loved this game. I played a ton of S.P.A.Z. and this game is a lot like that only with more customizable ships. It stared off great. I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me and realized I need to upgrade my ship. Grinded a bit and started playing around with my own designs. Went back a killed the guys giving me problems and started exploring a bit. Repeated those steps for a while until I ran into an Agent and they are my biggest issue with the game. They are horribly unbalanced. They absoluted decimated me. It isn't a problem to have hard boss like entities that you neeed to prepare for, but these guys become more powerful everytime they kill you and everytime you get in range they spawn more support ships and you either end up feeding them to the point that they are basically unbeatable and you have to flee to a new map or you have to go and grind until your ship is fully upgraded and you have an entire fleet of fully upgraded ships just to stand a chance and it just becomes a chore because there are multiple Agents per map and they all need a fully upgraded leet to defeat. At least the 10 or so I encountered. I was forced a few times to flee the map via the wormholes because they were just destroying everything I had only to warp into a new map, which makes you lose your fleet in doing so btw, only to find an Agent right there that was even more powerful than the one I just ran from and now I have no fleet and no supporting station network. It really killed my desire to play. If the Agents had a set number of ships that never increased or they were more balanced to the level of the player, I think I would enjoy the game more and actually come back and play it.\n\nAfter getting into the game, it just feels like it's either a grind or you are getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you. Maybe some people enjoy a game like that, but I prefer a game that is challenging, but fair without hours of grinding. I also don't see a point to the game other than the grinding and killing. SPAZ had a story and a purpose for the grind, this doesn't seem to.","August 27, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This mechanic is very well implemented and the game is really fun, flying round space blowing stuff up really never gets old. The building ship feature is very, very good (it could do with some fixs and some more variations), everything on the ship is down to you if it is too slow thats your faut (add more thrusters) or its just getting smashed against flagships and agents (add hull and shields) you can change it and upgrade it to fix these problems. Everytime you die there is something you can do to imporve the ship, you learn from every mistake and can adapt to it. There is something about this game that just brings me back to being a 5 year old playing with Lego and trying make HUGE planes and space ships.

The test option on the design screen is probably the truest test of them though.

It's a pretty looking, lego-like game, that lets you build your own ship from a measly fighter to an unstoppable jauggernaut capital ship. There are quite a few unique factions to unlock and build with that are all pretty fun to play as with their own special weapon types and building blocks.\n\nAlthough I full heartedly reccommend this game I think it's important point out some gripes.\n\nEnd Game Is kinda boring\n-Reassembly is one of those games where you become so powerful that there simply isn't strong enough competition to personally test your work of art against. There are some fleets you can battle that can be difficult but often times they can be really easy.\n\nFaction Economy and territyory system isn't fleshed out\n-Gaining and losing territory seems very ambiguous and pointless beyond %100 conquering the map, which is tedious and time consuming. There doesn't seem to be any benefit of having territory. You're supposed to give resources to ship building factories that will then go out and gain territory, but this is kind of un-engaging past bringing the materials in.\n-There aren't really any "capital" territories that faction forces are strongest at. Having these would bring in some depth to the world, adding difficulty and strategy to your campaign. Attack the capital of a faction and cripple it's economy so it can't reinforce other territories as easily. Some factions have cargo ships that don't really do anything but get killed by you for some free money. Giving them something to do that has benifits would be amazing for this game.\n\nBeyond anything I've mentioned the game is a great time! If you're even slightly considering picking this up, do it! Especially if it's on sale.","August 5, 2015","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I was a little skeptical over the price, but I'd say I got plenty of enjoyment and my money's worth. I very, very reccomend this game.\n\nThis is one of those "Easy to learn, hard to master" games. At least for the first few hours. There is so much variety in just the starting faction's arsenal that you'll spend plenty of time exploring your strengths and weaknesses. Then, over time you'll create the perfect vessel, one that is a Jack of All Trades or a Master in a specific area. But it doesn't stop there. You can build a factory on your ship, and then spawn other ships you've made to help you fight. (Assuming you've got the resources) Then, those ships can have factories too.\n\nAnother great feature is how both friend and foe alike will utilize battlefield debries to improve their armor or weapons.\n\nI like to play as a huge mother ship that is good at crowd control and sniping. So I make my ship's factory produce micro vessles I made, that pack a lot of fire power and speed at a cheap price. I even made a version that has it's own shields. They only cost about 300 RP, which means I can crank them out like nothing. I actually felt a sense of pride when  I saw them descend upon the Bee faction and absolutely wrecked them. They would gang up, six to one, and blast them to pieces. Hell, I had so many of these drones that they'd just crash into their ships at insane speads, cleaving off parts. I was prouder still, when I saw my lil guys loot their victim's shield module and use it. So they had the yellow shields of their enemies and my blue shields. :') Papa is proud. Except for the one that picked up a massive thruster and then spiraled forever, completely combat ineffective.","August 17, 2015","true","76.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun, the UI isn't too bad, it's nice creating ships where you have to worry about thruster position, centre of mass (both easily done with a symmetrical ship), if the ship has enough thrusters to maintain a decent speed (space friction is in effect here) or rotate rapidly enough (my main issue when designing). But then once all is said and done there's an issue: Once you get good enoguh at ship design and you've tried it with all the factions (or all the ones you like) there's nothing to really do. The starting grind is boring, running around demolishing every AI ship, agent or not, is boring. One well designed ship helmed by a player can and will crap on everything.\n\nI feel one thing this game needs is a true multiplayer to keep it fresh for longer. As it stands, once you have a death ship (my antimatter dreadnought comes to mind) there's no way in hell anything is ever gonna kill you. Tournament mode, this game's "multiplayer", is pretty boring. It's two player made ships fighting, but nobody has control of them, you have to hand it over to the ♥♥♥♥-poor AI that seem to have two modes: 'I have drones so run away and launch them', or 'CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE!', which managed to lead to the aforementioned dreadnought getting demolished because it refused to stay at maximum range where it wouldn't get chewed up by lasers and the like.\n\nAnyway, getting back to my point, multiplayer would really benefit it. A proper multiplayer in the proper game, not some multiplayer tournament-style thing. Teams or against would be personal preference because that would give an actual challenge once you get past that critical point of 'every AI ship is killed in moments'\n\nYes, I know that multiplayer would require a lot of work, but it feels like a game that *really* needs it. It seems almost designed for it, but it just doesn't have it.","December 26, 2015","true","47.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Damn is it unexpectedly interesting. Yes, I did buy it due to the positive reviews and the mentioned ship building. However never did I expect it to be so refreshingly unlimited. Because every weapon can shoot through your hull (presumably because it is actually on top) and hull is free, you could make a giant ship right from the start. however, it would be slow or almost uncontrollable thanks to its mass, but fight a few more ships and you might just get the dough to add more thrusters. Suddenly you could build yourself a flying wrecking ball. Is insanely small, high impact more you? Go for it. Want to have weapons all over your ship? Sure. Everything is at your fingers and damn is it addicting to constantly build, test it in a fight just to lose horribly and then rebuild it in a different way to achieve glorious victory.

That being said, I have 19 hours on it for a reason: it is still a blast. I can't imagine how fun it would be if they actually finished the game. It is somewhat like old spaceship fighter games, but with a fairly complex designing system. The damage on the ships is pretty fun too- parts get blown off when they get hit and slowly you reassemble over time if you make it to safety. You are supposed to take over territory, but the system for it isn't complete and it is a somewhat broken, annoying bruteforce type of take-over required to gain meaningful territory,","January 2","true","34.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun, the UI isn't too bad, it's nice creating ships where you have to worry about thruster position, centre of mass (both easily done with a symmetrical ship), if the ship has enough thrusters to maintain a decent speed (space friction is in effect here) or rotate rapidly enough (my main issue when designing). But then once all is said and done there's an issue: Once you get good enoguh at ship design and you've tried it with all the factions (or all the ones you like) there's nothing to really do. The starting grind is boring, running around demolishing every AI ship, agent or not, is boring. One well designed ship helmed by a player can and will crap on everything.\n\nI feel one thing this game needs is a true multiplayer to keep it fresh for longer. As it stands, once you have a death ship (my antimatter dreadnought comes to mind) there's no way in hell anything is ever gonna kill you. Tournament mode, this game's "multiplayer", is pretty boring. It's two player made ships fighting, but nobody has control of them, you have to hand it over to the ♥♥♥♥-poor AI that seem to have two modes: 'I have drones so run away and launch them', or 'CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGE!', which managed to lead to the aforementioned dreadnought getting demolished because it refused to stay at maximum range where it wouldn't get chewed up by lasers and the like.\n\nAnyway, getting back to my point, multiplayer would really benefit it. A proper multiplayer in the proper game, not some multiplayer tournament-style thing. Teams or against would be personal preference because that would give an actual challenge once you get past that critical point of 'every AI ship is killed in moments'\n\nYes, I know that multiplayer would require a lot of work, but it feels like a game that *really* needs it. It seems almost designed for it, but it just doesn't have it.","December 26, 2015","true","47.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not. You aren't limited to trying to destroy the enemy core ASAP to save it's pieces so you can upgrade your ship, although you pretty much have to kill in order to upgrade your ship in the first place in Reassembly. It's pretty much just Asteroids but with badass looking ships instead of a dinky triangle. It's kinda hard to explain, but basically there are multiple factions, around 15 at the time of me writing this review, and you only get to be in one at the start. To get in others, you have to kill giant murder machines from other factions to unlock them. There's also a weird credits and resource system, you gain resource (called R in-game) by either farming or murdering other factions, and you get credits (called C in-game) by dropping off your resource at stations or ships with a factory on it, and then those stations/ships can use your resource you dropped off to make more ships, possibly a ship with a factory on it, making a weird cycle.\n\nAlso, pro-tip for newbies, GET THE FARMER FACE (faction 2) AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.\nIt's pretty much better than all of the other factions, because they can farm with ease because they can attach plants to themselves so you can essentially farm on the go, which, as previously stated, gives you resource.\n\nAll in all, if you like ship building and somewhat intense space battles, Reassembly is for you. A solid 10/10.","January 3","true","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you have a max P ship at 8k or even 6-7k, you might as well just start another game because at that point the enemy is powerless against you, hell i even installed the mod that does so there is at all times like 40 agents on the map, and i download all the highest rate/sub modded boss fleets, even so once i hit that 6-8k P nobody can touch me...\n\nOverall i think this game is the best sandbox space sim out there, giving it a 7,5/10 :theinterceptor:","January 23","true","56.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
