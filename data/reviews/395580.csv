All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I pick the good ones\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nThis is a mobile game, control and design wise, but this review is on this steam version without taking into account the mobile app.\n\nThis is a game about creativity, every level is a puzzle that has an objective to complete using a limited set of tools, the levels themselves vary in their straightforwardness (I belive i made up that word) the complexity of the perfect solution.\n\nThe tools provided for each level are not always essential to use all of them, but to get all the stars and score a perfect rating, you must think in whatever twisted way the creator of that level thought of using all the tools.\n\nAnd if the levels prove to be not enough to quinsh your hunger for creativity and design, the create mode allows you to create your own level and share it with your friends (and only your friends) using tools you unlock during your play of the main levels.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/395580/\n\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros:\n+simple click-and-drag controls\n+high levels of creativity and complexity in some puzzles' design\n+quick and easy to open and play\n+cartoonish (very safe) art style\n+create mode\n+wide variety of tools to use\n\nCons:\n-sharing custom-made levels with friends only (basically you cant play any custom level made by anyone unless they share it with you)\n-haveing to go through all the levels to unlock all the create items (its a big con if you are in it for the create mode)\n-sound track could have been a bit more interesting (I ended up turning it off half way through the levels)\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\na fun, creative, addicting, simple, easy-to-learn, and strangely relaxing game that keeps your mind thinking, and your stress levels down.  the amount of content is well worth the asking price on steam.  and the create mode adds more hours of fun, but sadly the sharing  can limit it a bit.\n\nscore: 7.5/10\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curtations here!","November 11, 2015","true","5.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As it is, the game is a pretty fun goldberg machine type puzzle game thing. But it is also a very lazy port from mobile. It's pretty much the exact same game as mobile but you are paying double for it. There's no optimization for the swap to mouse and keyboard so everything feels a bit clunky since they were meant for touch and drag.\n\nOptions: almost non-existent, you can reset the game and turn music on and off. Sound effects stay on no matter what and you have to use the windows shortcut to get it out of fullscreen which is annoying.\n\nThe game itself: Standard, not really a new concept. It works fairly well for the most part and is really adorable. Puzzles start off simple and as you progress more stuff gets thrown into the mix and makes things more complicated. "Multiplayer" is useless. It's not so much multiplayer as a level creator and sharing levels. The issue is it lacks an actual workshop, the only way to play other people's levels is to add them into your in-game friends making the level creator worthless if you don't have friends playing this on their pcs or phones.\n\nConclusions: I like the game honestly but get it on mobile, or at least try it on mobile because you get the first 14 levels for free. I don't really feel like paying double for a lazy port on pc is worth it at all.","October 6, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Mechanics are awesome, graphics are so cute, especially for younger audience.  At some point, tasks becomes really hard, which makes this game interesting not only for kids.

The game includes over 100 different puzzles so you can get quite a bit of enjoyment out of the game.\n\nThe game is easy to play but more challenging than you would expect based on the cutesy graphics. Inventioneers is a moderately difficult puzzle game.\n\nThe only issue I had with the game is that it really isn't that original. If you have played another one of these contraption games before, you aren't getting anything new with Inventioneers. The game does a good job with what it is but after a while it kind of feels like more of the same.\n\nIf you like these type of game I would recommend picking up Inventioneers.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game.\n\nRead My Full Review[www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 9, 2015","true","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

This port is not one of those.\nIt completely lacks any graphics options or other PC centric settings. You also need to press quit twice for the game to exit.\nThe most important issue with this game is the fact that the physics are not the same with two restarts of the same puzzle.  You can see in the video below, at minute 50, that the coconut on the right bounces in different directions without moving anything near it. For a game based 90% on physics, this is unforgivable.\nI don’t know if this happens on mobile also, but that’s the main reason this gets a negative review.\nWatch me play here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KqkE036J58","October 11, 2015","false","3.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I bought it for my 2 sons (11 and 7), and they just loved it; they managed to win the game almost all by themselves. There were a lots of big laugh moments along the way. Good job devs, here :)\n\nIt's a port from a tablet, and it shows in the chapter selection (but once in the game there’s no other mouse problem). There's no option either... it's not really a problem, but it's still sad.\n\nBe warned that the physics engine is a bit random for some reasons. I don't know why, but it's a fact that playing the same puzzle again, doing exactly the same things as before, may have a butterfly effect : there's a little thing that is not exactly like before, and the differences then just goes bigger and bigger. Well... the positive thing is that the game was made with this particularity in mind, and therefore solutions DON'T ask you to place an object at exactly a specific pixel.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game, fun, and addictive, especially for children of course.","December 2, 2015","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
