It is somewhere between a third person action/puzzle game and a more console-oriented 3D platformer.  You start the game switching between the rabbit and the dormouse who have different fighting and special abilities, with Alice following you around.\n\nI had to run the game in compatibility mode for Vista or it wouldn't launch in Win7, and I'm still getting glitchy sound and finicky controls with the gamepad in the menus.  However, there aren't many games that are at least loosely connected to Tim Burton's work, so for what it is, buy it on sale and see what you think.  In this era of discounted games, it's probably worth $5 if you especially like Wonderland and Tim Burton, and maybe another $5 if you tend to finish console-style 3D platformers.","December 16, 2014","true","2.9"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","0"

The movie had Tim Burton and Jonny Depp which i am a fan of. The game retains alot of that feeling, which is good.\nBut this games strong point is beyond any doubt the local coop.\n\nA wholesome strangely strange excpirience that can be shared. Refreshing and envigorating.\n\nTechnically the game is a bit quirky, with low framerates in cutscenes and odd audio sparkling at times. But generally the game worked just fine for me, and i really enjoyed playing it in local coop.","March 14, 2015","true","26.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/316030/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","Quite a curious thing this Alice of a game, muchier than the Movie which lacked muchness as such.  Put on your best Futterwacken shoes for this Frabjous day as we celebrate one being better than the other, by one, its this one and not the other.  Zounding for one to be far yadder than the other, like being small or too tall.  We must hold up the movie to a mirror, going through the looking glass to arrive at this game, which was described in Alicespeak but now normalspeak.\n\nThis game from start to finish is a work of art in even the smallest of details.  Alice is not the playable character, players take on the roles of the characters of the movie, hot swapping back and forth.  These characters convey oddly more emotion than the movie with expressions, and camera shots one upping the great Tim Burton.  The character animations surpass the acting in the movie done with such detail in every expression that they convey.  There are TONS of extra recorded dialog and animations when just walking around, Alice may sit on a bench, point at things of interest.  This extra attention to detail is what shows this game stands out.  Many devs do the least to make a game, in this case they did more than they had to.  This is what being a game dev is about, not making the cheapest game on budget, but the best possible game within that budget.  These devs had impossible ideas, where they made the impossible, possible!\n\nThe musical score is incredible in the BIG budget way Disney can do but hasnt in nearly any of their games.  Incredible Voice Acting, most of the cast from the movie return to voice their characters in game.  The controls with controller are intuitive to the point of being a pick up and play game so everyone can enjoy it and share it locally via co-op with someone else.  Not a hard game, with puzzles that make sense, no need to google, just apply common sense.\n\nThe graphics are not great, their good, but they all work well making the world feel alive.  The Devs flex their skills to pay the bills with more breakable objects in this game than GTA V.  Killing enemies is fun, slashing grass is fun!  The sound effects make even slashing grass a fun thing to do and highly addictive though it serves no purpose really in the game.   Attacking the Queens Card Soldiers results in parts of their armor being knocked off, they can be one shot after upgrading skills, but knocking off their armor is very satisfying.\n\nThere are no steam achievements which is odd because the game does have achievements.  Completing achievements  which isnt hard, unlocks concept art.  This concept art with its detail is on the amazing level of Fallout.  If only we could get a physical artbook it looks so good and we only get a bit of it in game.  Sadly this studio is closed, because only the good die young.  Lets hope like a virus this French studio infects the rest of the gaming industry with their talent to make all our games more enjoyable for all of us.\n\nRating:  10/10  Value:  $14.99\n\nPut on your Bee-ar goggles its time to go in depth on this ish.  Celebrate because in 2015, the 150th anniversary of Alice in Wonderland, this is the time to play an Alice game, this one, McGees or both?\n\nOnly 2 games ever made, came off better than their movie counterparts, this game and Wanted: Weapons of Fate.  Wanted fits right in with Alice, you may be asking yoruself how that is?  The studio who made Wanted is called Grin with pretty much the logo of the classic expression of our favorite Cheshire Cat.\n\nYou may be wondering why arent we playing Alice, why are we the side characters as if were just tagging along for the ride?  Alice in Wonderland was written in a Fantasy Genre created that merely followed the character as they wandered around, this type of storytelling was very popular in its day.  Another example is the author Charles Kingsleigh the father of Alice in the movie but not the book, who wrote Water Babies two years prior to Alice using the same storytelling style where we as readers go along for the ride on a fantastic journey.  The game trailer follows this storytelling style saying in BIG words "Follow Alice".\n\nTim Burton broke this golden rule, by making the movie through the eyes of Alice not about Alice.  A modern example of this storytelling style following the character around in a fantasy world is Mad Max.  Mad Max written by George Miller is not really about Max, its the audience following the character Max as things happen around the character just like Alice in Wonderland.  Meaning Max like Alice in wonderland is Max in Post-Apocalyptic Land. Hows that for dank?!?!\n\nHow is the game better than the movie?\nThe game takes HUGE liberties with the storytelling making it flow better than the movie.  Key moments in the story such as when Alice grows large meeting the Red Queen.  In the movie Alice sneaks into the garden with the Red Queen, she asks the rabbit for cake to be taller to save the Hatter.  She then scarfs it down for no reason in the movie, also no explanation as to why being taller would help save the Hatter.  In the game Alice is in the garden and needs to be bigger to get into a bigger door so she eats the cake from the rabbit but loving cake so much she eats too much becoming a giant.\n\nIn the movie Alice needs the Vorpal Sword guarded by the Bandersnatch who is missing an eye but the creature seems unhurt by this.  Alice then steals the eye from the mouse to get the sword not caring about the bandersnatch at all.  In the game its SHOWN that she sees the Bandersnatch in pain because its missing an eye.  Alice demands the eye to help the bandersnatch and get the vorpal sword, everyone wins, we can have both!\n\nIn the movie Alice is almost forced to fight the Jabberwocky.   In the game due to the battles the player goes through, Alice actually starts side commenting she feels more confident, then later invincible, growing beyond her control like a Marine in Full Metal Jacket.  By the end in the game when it is time to fight the Jabberwocky, the player is salty, Alice is ready to eat her own guts and ask for seconds.\n\nIn the end of the movie Alice wants to go home so is given a potion from the white queen.  Keep in mind Alice in the movie is a hero who just slayed a HUGE monster the Jabberwocky.  Now she wants to go back to a world where she is being forced to marry some guy and possibly be alone forever like her aunt???  This movie ending makes no sense.  This crappy cop-out like Dorothy in the Wizard Oz clicking her heels, because she wants to return to her inbred family on a dirt farm plagued by tornadoes is beyond belief.  In the game Alice is tricked into drinking the potion by the White Queen because she wasnt leaving which makes actual sense!  There is a great concept art that is unlocked showing all the characters waving, its real nice to see after that ending.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n9358zVHwM\n\nDoes any of that crap that happens in the movie happen in the books?\nChecked out the whole series and the answer is NO!\n\nThis game is better than the movie when held up to a mirror.  How far does this mirror analogy go of right and wrong, what sources do you have?\nLong review short, this mirror mess may go all the way to the top of the US government.\n\nExhibit A Newsweek May 7th 1979:\n"Jimmy Carter Changed the part in his Hair from right side to left, the Washington Press Corps demanded an explanation"\nJimmy Carter while President after his malaise speech changed the part in his hair changing the tone of the entire debate, noone ever knew or knows what changed the publics perception, but it is the side of his head where he parted his hair that changed everything and the world???!!!\nExhibit B Superman:\nClark Kent the bumbling reporter parts his hair on the right, but the Man of Steel parts his hair on the left, hmmm:    http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luvw1iNDwH1qdfhbno1_400.gif","August 13, 2015","true","21.4"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","26","40","9","0"

So don't play it! Only solution to the bug is downloading a savefile from the internet and picking up from there (so much for your in-game achievements, upgrades, money, treasure hunting...).\n\nThe game itself is just ok, and very easy, with tons of other minor bugs (especially framerate on cutscenes being abysmal, which is solved by quickly alt-tabbing out the game and back in).\n\nIf you're looking for a good Alice game, go for Alice: Madness Returns.","December 18, 2015","false","14.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","9"

But this one honestly deserves one.\nI know its not alice madness returns, I know its not the best cutscene-graphic you ever saw, and I sure as hell(o) know that it does contain some very gamebreaking bugs.\n\nBought it on sale for 3 euros. Originally 20.\nBut damn. 3 euros for 9 hours of magic. 3 euros for a game that seems like a cheap-♥♥♥ kids game but is in all fairness extremely hard (at parts) and punishing on the level of dark souls. With the lovely alice-story and all the lovely friends. AND HATTER WITH JOHNNY DEPP VOICE I SWEAR TO GOD IM FAINTING. Ok it's Jared Butler but it sounds so good.\n\nThe bugs I encountered however broke my game so I actually had to go get my save-file and restore. First of all I destroyed the wall in the hare's house BEFORE alice went all big girls are beautiful and I couldn't interract with anything. Second the god damn door smacked down in my face and I couldn't go in or out with alice's face on the outside derpin' at me cause apparantley she doesn't open doors to save my savefile.\n\nBut thats okay. A highly suprising game, definetly worth its price and surpasses by far. How this game has "mixed" on reviews on steam I do not know. If you have 3 euros and feel like doing something fun, get this one. 4/20++","April 24","true","12.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

Graphics and voice actors are quite good, too.\nInstead of playing with Alice herself, you have to switch between her friends, using their different skills to protect her from the Red Queens guards and solve a great variety of puzzles. Unlike other people in this review section I didn't encounter any major bugs or lags, so either I'm lucky or they fixed these problems by now. The only point of criticism lies in the controls: Don't try to play this game with mouse+keyboard, unless you feel like adding that kind of annoying extra difficulty and frustration.","April 8","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That was way too long, way too tedious and has got me hating the idea of playing yet another god dammed Alice game.\n\nAnyways, I got in this game and noticed that it's based exactly off of the 2010 reboot film Alice in Wonderland.\nNow I only watched bits and pieces of the movie so I don't know how precise the game is to the movie.\nOne thing I did notice is that the game grasped how Alice is still the same annoying, stupid and ditzy character as she is in the movie.\nIf I hear her say "How Peculiar" one more F**KING TIME I'm going to f**king kill myself!!!\nAnyways, luckily you play as the characters thoughout the film/game and not Alice, starting with McTwisp the rabbit, Mad Hatter, and EVEN CHESHIRE MOTHER F**KING CAT!!!!!!\n(Or Cheshurr Cat accoring to the idioitic misinformative game dev's)\n\nThe game feels like a cross-breed between Ratchet & Clank (PS2) and Spyro the Dragon (PSX), it's an open, yet still linear base game where there's lots of hidden collectables (abilities you need to find to unlock before purchasing) and currency from destroying the objects throughout the map.\nThe collectibles are in the most stupid areas, by the time I found the first one (not the first one singlehandly given to you) I already had 15K currency, and from paying 800-1000 per ability you're pretty much set to buy every damn unlock you receive which makes it almost too easy.\n\nYou need to constantly find cake and potions for Alice to make her big/small to fit though certain doors correspondingly, which makes no sense why a small Alice can't fit through a big door when Mad Hatter (who's 6' tall) and that fat a** Cheshire Cat can fit through a small door.\n\n**SPOILER**\nAfter you meet the White Queen she marks every chest and unlockables you missed on your map and makes it so Alice does not need to grow/shrink to access any door, thank god!\nTherefore there is some sort of replay value going back to previous levels to unlock more things (much like R&C/Spyro).\n\nThe controls are Keyboard (NO MOUSE) or Controller only!\nSo if you're like me and only use a Keyboard + Mouse good luck.\nIt takes time to get used to switching characers, using their different abilities and mastering the movements in combat to protect that stupid useless Alice from being captured.\n\nThe music and graphics are good, besides the frame rate dropping ball sack during every cutscene! It's so choppy, and it's not my graphics trust me. It's poorly developed.\nThankfully this game is not too long, and the boss fights take some thinking to defeat them which is nice.\n\nIn the end, I would recommend this game over that garbage Alice: Madness Returns, but I would NOT EVER pay the CDN $22 for this crap, it's only worth maybe $5, so wait 'till it's on sale to ever consider getting it like I did.\n\n5/10","January 5, 2015","true","8.2"," 18 of 46 people (39%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","39","18","46","9","0"
