But I will include some tips anyway.\n\n\nTIPS:\n\nClick your mouse to throw cash at the pole dancer.\nMake sure you are in range, or else your money thrown won't count towards your total.\nThe more money she gets, the higher the percentage will grow in the bar at the bottom of the screen.\nAt 100%, you get a bronze award; at 500%, silver; and at 1000%, gold.\nThere is a timer in the bottom left of the screen. Each session goes for 120 seconds.\n\nAvoid everything falling from the ceiling; except for the dollar signs with the rainbow tails, as they give your cash a multiplier effect. If you are hit, you will be stilled for a few moments.\nThe more rainbow dollars you catch, the more your multiplier effect will increase.\nThe worms that emerge out of the floor will damage your multiplier effect.\n\nWatch out for bullets that are fired from the side of the stage. If you are hit, you will be stilled for a few moments.\nBullets can be avoided by ducking.\n\nThe keys A and D will move you left and right, whilst S will make you duck.\n\nBy the way, the "Champion" achievement ("Get 10 gold, silver and bronze trophies") does not work.\nThere have been several complaints about this.\nThe start screen shows the number of trophies that you have - I have more than 10 of each, and have not received that achievement either.\nHowever, 0.7% of peole have attained that achievement, so maybe there is a catch in the way it should be done (e.g. maybe it can only be achieved with one particular character in the game).\nThe developer really needs to fix that issue.\n\n"Shake Your Money Simulator 2016" is not a serious game.\nIt is obviously a dumb, stupid, and crass game - so only buy it on that basis.","May 3","true","2.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","3","9","3","0"

I know that when you look at the price of this game and you see money being thrown at a pixelated stripper, you automatically think "this game is a total joke".. or perhaps that this game is "cheap garbage"!\n\nIt's actually pretty darn fun! ..until you play two or three 'two-minute' games and your forefinger starts to get sore from clicking your left mouse button a few thousand times, lol.\n\nWatch my Video Review Right here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s8pZjqbFBM\n\nSo you get to choose from a wild assortment of characters before you play by just clicking your character (not shown in my video), and then you must dodge all the dog poop, safes, chickens and other debris being thrown down at you, as well as bullets being shot at you which you must duck under to avoid.  All the while, you are on a two-minute timer to get as much love from that stripper as you can, so you are in a mad dash to hurl cash at her by spamming your left mouse button as fast as possible!  It's actually pretty damn fun for a few minutes at a time, until your forefinger gets numb and/or sore, hehe.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that if you play this game enough, your mouse-using forefinger just might get as big and defined as which-ever arm you use to fap with!  :-P\n\nI gave this game a 69% score trying to judge it fairly in my video, seems like a pretty fitting score.. most of it comes from a higher then expected "value" score.  The game surpised me, it really did.  I figured for sure when i bought it that it would be getting a really low score and I'd be leaving a negative review and requesting an 83 cent refund.. but I've decided to keep the game!  I think it will be fun to "throw some dough at a ho" from time to time!  :-)  ..In all seriousness, it's not bad.","March 28","true","0.3"," 4 of 49 people (8%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","8","4","49","3","2"
