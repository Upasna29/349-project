I loved the Wipeout games, is this a modern take on it?  Sadly not even close.\n\nThe first problem I encountered is that there are no insturctions on how to play.  I selected the first of what appears to be 3 stages, got in a match against three other racers... and sat there.  The other ships zoomed off, and I was pressing my keyboard and mouse trying to figure out how to move.  I quit out of the game and looked for help, tutorial, anything.  In the end trial and error by pressing every key on my keyboard I discovered "X" was the magic key I needed to press to figure out how to go forward.\n\nAlright, so no controls are posted.  That isn't a great sign.  Still, now I finally know how to play.  Get ready world.... Wipeout clone here I come.\n\nOh, no, wait.  You only can choose from one ship.  The controls are sluggish.  The tracks are boring.  Wipeout used the vertical element in its track design to great effect.  This game has only a few race tracks to try, and they are bland and no fun to race on.  And at all times I felt like I was fighting poor controls.\n\nThe worst part though in this generic knockoff tragedy, worse than the lack of instructions, the poor controls, the bland music and the boring race tracks.... is that even once you take the time to really master the game it isn't fun or satisfying.  Hitting an enemy ship with a weapon does not have any sort of satisfying impact.  Hitting boost arrows never leads to those "breakneck speed chains" you would expect in a title like this.  In fact, at the end of the day you don't seem to be able to go very fast at all.... in a racing game.\n\nI liked some of the particle effects, and it about ends there.  This game is a chore to learn how to play, and even once you do there is no fun waiting to be had in the mastery of the mechanics.\n\n1/10","May 14","false","3.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Simply a minimalistic white background with triangles and numbers. I had to figure out by myself what I was looking at. There's absolutely nothing intuitive in the game. Not to mention the fact that we're obliged to sign up on the devs website before even thinking about starting a race... in a game that doesn't even features multiplayer. But the worst is yet to come...\n\nSince there is no option menu I also had figure out the controls by myself. Left arrow and Right arrow are for changing direction but what about acceleration? Isn't it the Up arrow? No it's not! Why would you use the Up arrow in the first place!? Thanks to Shinryu's review on Steam I've been able to start a race without wasting too much time looking for the acceleration key (which is "X" by the way).\n\nThe two first races I played simply look bland, short and repetitive (be careful not to race out of the map). Thanks to the very narrow track there is simply no way to complete the 5 laps without hitting the wall every 5 seconds. Here, the steering would need some tweaking.\n\nThe visuals are minimalistic at best but at least they fit with the sci-fi setting. During the race I experienced some framerate drops which is unacceptable for a game that looks like a game made in the late 90's (the early 3D cards era). But since it's using the Unity engine, what was I expecting? Also, if you use video capture software the game will freeze during recording.\n\nOverall, I would only recommend this game if you're a masochist that promote "no taste gaming" like me.\n\nI dare you to watch this 3 minutes video to the end!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcMBeg7KRZ4\n\nRating:\n2.0","October 21, 2015","false","2.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","4"

Most people use controllers for racing games.\n- No options at all, for binding the controls, etc.\n- Graphics are PS1 level.\n- Very unforgiving, if you hit a wall once it slows you down to nothing and you usually cant regain your place.\n- The physics are wonky, if you hit a boost it goes straight in that direction instead of being able to drift around corners.\n\nIt's a nice proof of concept but it needs a lot more work before it can be a decent game.","December 29, 2015","false","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most people use controllers for racing games.\n- No options at all, for binding the controls, etc.\n- Graphics are PS1 level.\n- Very unforgiving, if you hit a wall once it slows you down to nothing and you usually cant regain your place.\n- The physics are wonky, if you hit a boost it goes straight in that direction instead of being able to drift around corners.\n\nIt's a nice proof of concept but it needs a lot more work before it can be a decent game.","December 29, 2015","false","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Decent music, graphics and gameplay out of a mobile game, absolutely no support for any kind of controller, and some of the worst keyboard driving dynamics I've ever had the misfortune to play with.\nWeapons are pretty good, although there's one that causes a wavy screen and cuts your racer's power that is very poorly-implemented.\n\nThe AI is pointless, has no pathifinding ability around the other machines, and is faster largely because the player is forced to use a keyboard. The races are grindfests, since winning is almost entirely luck, but you can replay the 6-lap time trial for 3 points each time. Only 3 opponents means the tracks are largely dead, there is rarely any other vehicle around you to use your weapons on.\n\nThe graphics are passable. Very simple geometry and detailed, low-res textures give it an early 3D look. The machine designs look great and overall the handling isn't bad, machines are responsive and turn quickly. Nailing the apex is pretty satisfying, especially when you have a boost in your pocket for the exit. It would be easier and a lot more fun with analog controls.\nThe keyboard seems to like to ignore or lock input, resulting in a quick tap sending the machine hard into the wall. So you can be impressed for a while until you start racing hard, until you find deploying powerups through a turn will cause you to crash.\n\nIf you crash by brushing a wall, your machine will phase through it and continue out into space before respawning.\n\nYou will have more fun by running the 20-year-old Wipeout 2O97 in Dosbox, I guarantee it.","January 3","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are a lot of things missing from Ampersand that should be present in any respectable racing game. Hell, there are a lot of things missing from Ampersand that should be present in any game that involves driving, period. A common complaint I hear about this game is that there's no tutorial or manual explaining the function of the buttons or powerups. This is true, and a very valid concern, but I find it much more concerning that Ampersand eschews basic functions of driving such as braking or reversing. Considering an easy 25% of the speed boosts on these tracks will slam you directly into a wall, these would have been helpful things to include. If there's anything nice to be said about Ampersand, it's that it is at least priced in proportion to its quality.","March 24","false","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is no explanation of controls, I had to figure out that x is acceleration and z is use powerup through hitting random keys. The hovercraft is extremely hard to control; it slides around the map while the computers have no trouble avoiding walls. There is no indication of how one gets points or even what these do. I thought it would be 1 point for third, 2 for second, and 3 for first, but I got third place on the first track and second on the second and only recieved one point each time. Some other hovercrafts are locked as well as the 4th and 5th maps but I have no idea how to unlock them. The powerups are unexplained so I would just use them immediately upon getting them, but even if I could see what happened I have no idea how effective they are or how to use them strategically. It is very hard to cathc up to the computers, the only way I was able to do it was by passing them after they had blown each other up, but this means that getting first place is seemingly impossible. Overall this game could be a lot better if it was a little more polished but at this point I'm just glad I got it for 14 cents.","December 22, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it as a gag, just something to ♥♥♥♥ around with and laugh at. I cannot even do that from the amount of times the game itself has froze and glitched on me.\n\nThis game does not give you any sort of explanation for the controls, but as soon as it the game starts up, it asks you for your gamejolt login. Seeing that, I already assumed I'd be using either the z or x keys. Sure enough, I did.\n\nX - gas\nArrow keys - steer\n\nLovely controls for a racing game, I know.\n\nBetween the awful controls and annoying glitches, this game is definitely isn't worth the money, even for how cheap it is.\n","December 24, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even at the 0.59c I bought it for it's not worth it! There is absolutely no options menu so you cannot check controls, or change display settings or turn off the god awful music. Steering is all over the place and there is no controller support either, just the letters X and Z on your keyboard and the left/right arrow keys to move. If it was an early access game I'd say ok, it needs more work, but since this is the final product...I cannot recommend it at all. I can't believe Steam allow games like this to exist on the platform. For the love of god, run fast, run far, stay away from this game!","June 3","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, had to ignore it to make corners.\n-Very little motivation for performing well in the game, other than to play more of it: no sense of victory when you beat the first place goal in a level, and the AI opponents don't really feel like opponents tyring to win...more like lifeless husks just doing their thing.\n\nInstead of playing this, just watch a video of Wipeout or F-Zero on youtube or something. Definitely do not recommend.","June 3","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
