This is just my first experience playing it and what my thoughts are about it so far. First of all, I must admit I am a bit disappointed because it was so short. My first playthrough took 40 minutes, but I'm assuming they did that because it was designed to be played in Speedrun Mode. Simple controls - A to jump, S to save checkpoint, arrow keys to move. It's not a very complicated idea and there aren't really any special mechanics; it's player vs. environment. Not to say that they need to add more things to spice it up, it was made like that and it's supposed to be like that. Its simplicity is one of the things I like most about the game.\n\nAnother thing I liked was that I was really starting to groove and dig the music since I entered the fourth level (yellow walls). They definitely need to get a soundtrack up. Really set the vibe, and got me to enjoy it and just chill. Great job on that.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the more times I replay it, the more I love it. If you didn't see me mention it just a second ago, you can play the game in Speedrun Mode with a timer and an option to upload to the leaderboards. Now, I'm not exactly sure where the leaderboards are accessible from at the moment but hey, it just came out a couple hours ago. If it's addicting to play now, without a public leaderboard, I can only imagine how much time I'd spend when it does come out. You can also play it in YOLO mode where you only have 1 life for all 12 levels.\n\nFirst impression was that the difficulty levels were too low but like most games, they introduce new knowledge slowly or how to approach a certain situation then build the difficulty up as you go along. But it's still a mildly challenging game, so I'm hoping the level designers might tweak a few things to make it slightly more difficult. Not Super-Meat-Boy-difficult of course, just something that might make people put more effort into trying to finish it. But until then, YOLO mode ought to do for now. Also, they should really make it so that ESC doesn't completely exit you out of the game. I was trying to go to the menu in the middle of a game and exited instead.\n\nGive it a chance. I wasn't very impressed the first time I played it but after spending a bit more time with it, I'm looking forward to where they're taking Love and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who'd enjoy a simple and cute little indie game.","February 7, 2014","true","30.0"," 170 of 190 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","170","190","0","10"

It seems I'm in the minority who doesn't agree the soundtrack is all that fantastic. The platforming is mildly well designed at best, and certainly doesn't hold a candle up to a game like Super Meat Boy, for instance. There definitely aren't enough levels to keep me coming back for too long.\n\nWell, for all that I have to gripe about it, it's still only $3, and I bought it at $1 in a sale, so frankly for the price tag there's very little to complain about. You still get a good amount of entertainment for your money, and the one song in the soundtrack worth the tag Great Soundtrack is indeed Great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfrog/recommended/269270/","coldfrog","coldfrog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldfrog/","386 products in account","This game is platforming at its most basic.  The controls are exactly what they need to be for making almost but not quite pixel-perfect jumps, and the graphics, while hardly the best, offer a few well-designed visual backgrounds and are always functional enough to let you recognize what will kill you and what dangers are ahead.  The levels are well designed with just enough trickiness to offer potential traps but that the Single Life mode seems (at least to me) very much possible, some day, with enough practice.  And the levels are also fun, which I think is the most important part.  They are all very memorable in at least one way, and offer a variety of challenges.  They are good enough that I feel it is worth playing through the speedrun mode, and playing multiple rounds to attempt to reach A++ scores.\n\nBasically, it is a well-crafted challenge platformer that is beatable by probably most people but also offers enough challenges that people will want to come back to it repeatedly, and is short enough that a full game is not a huge time sink and failing does not prohibit you from coming back and playing again because you felt like you spent too much time on it.  I would rank it better than average, and well worth the very low price of entry.","August 1, 2014","true","3.9"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/recommended/269270/","Cantisque","Canti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/","2676 products in account",""Love" is an endurance platformer with an Atari aesthetic.\n\nFirst point to make is about the price. At full price, it's still cheaper than most games even with a big discount. The reason for this is that the game is very small. If you've watched the trailer, you've pretty much seen the entire game.\n\nAs is the way with most platformers, you simply jump through each level and make your way to the end. You can place checkpoints whenever and wherever you wish, but each time you do so will drop your score significantly. The main appeal of the game is to try and get the highest score (and lowest time) possible, fitting Atari gameplay with the overall look.\n\nThe whole game can be completed in well under 10 minutes. I was personally able to finish it in 9 and there was plenty of room for improvement there too. If you are looking for a lot of content, you won't find it here. This game is specifically designed to appeal to speedrunners and platformer purists.\n\nThe graphics are extremely basic. Each level consists of a single colour, plus black and white. This highly pixelled look is not just for show, it is to help with the precision platforming element where the edges of platforms are absolute. This makes unfair deaths by missing platforms because you didn't quite land on the edge practically non-existent.\n\nThe audio is similarly basic. There are a few chiptune-type tracks playing on each level but none of them are particularly good. Sound effects are sparse, mainly because nothing happens. Dying and bouncing on "bouncers" are the only times you'll hear anything. The few existing sound effects fit the theme well enough.\n\nIt's hard to give a recommendation for this game because there is a limited audience for it. If you love platformer games and want a game to properly test your skills, this is the perfect game to do so. It throws enough variety in level design to keep you on your feet and encourages you to keep trying to get that perfect score.\n\nIf there were ever a graduation exam for platformer gamers, this would be it. A gauntlet of differently laid out levels that must be conquered in a single sitting, with a no-nonsense audio/visual theme and some simple, yet tight controls to boot.","February 20, 2014","true","7.9"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","31","37","0","2"

Baby don't hurt me. Love is a simple, 2D platformer full of spikes and trampolines. You'll have 100 lives to make it through 12 'levels' of Love (easy mode has unlimited lives). When you die, you'll instantly respawn at the last checkpoint. The twist to this Love is that you'll make your own checkpoints on solid surfaces. The only controls are simple: left, right, jump and set a respawn. Its simple, but difficult all at the same time. When moving the screen left or right, I felt like the framerate would drop. Even on my 3.4 gHz Dual Core would drop from time to time, causing inaccuracies and death.\n\nWhen you go into a game, are you looking for a challenge? Are you a 'speedrunner' that wants to shave seconds off your play time? Then Love might just be the game for you! For the challenge, there is a lot of precision jumping off of moving trampolines. You'll also be landing between two spikes without dying and running between drops of acid. There are a few blind jumps, but you'll quickly remember them. A lot of the time the levels have many heights. So you can fall down to a lower area and either you'll have to climb back up or die to respawn at the last checkpoint if it was above you.\n\nThe downside to the game is that it is over within 15 minutes or so. It seems like Love is less than its contemporaries like VVVVV and You Have to Beat the Game. When you complete the game, it gives you a grade a time and a score. So for score runners and speed runners, there is a reason to replay and try one of the different difficulties. While the challenge of Love is still definitely there, its all just one clear cut path with only a few moments of deviation. There is no sense of exploration. Its all just clear cut. The level designs are a mixed bag. It goes from clean levels to areas that look like line art and spiked floor deathtraps. Some levels offer sloping paths, but there's no slide mechanic. Other levels detailed with circled indents and jagged spikes.\n\nLove will rarely switch up gameplay. There is a glimpse of a different play mechanic with a slow descent fall. But for the most part it is just moving trampoline platforms, shooting bullets in wave patterns and not much else. It feels like Love only offers spikes, bouncing and death pits. Once you are through the main game, the bonus levels offer much needed diversity to levels. Such as platforms the player can control, portals and giant static rings. So I see the developer is still trying to add more content. All the bonus levels play out pretty quickly.\n\nIt just seems like too quick of a game without enough diversity until the bonus levels. Even then, the gameplay is always the same and Love does nothing to add features beyond different death traps.","November 4, 2014","false","1.0"," 78 of 119 people (66%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","66","78","119","11","8"

There is no story. It's just pure platforming.\n\nThe game has five different modes\nArcade Mode: You have 100 lives and an unlimited number of checkpoints.\nEasy Mode: You have unlimited lives, but you score less points.\nYOLO Mode: You only get one life.\nSpeedrun Mode: You have to try and beat the game as fast as possible.\nRemix Mode: 8 additional remixed levels.\n\nThe main game has 16 levels, while Remix Mode offers 8 additional remixed levels. All of which are short, but moderately challenging. There are a lot of indie platformers out there that are ridiculously hard. This one offers a challenge, but doesn't feel impossible to beat. Unless of course, you're playing on YOLO mode. That really does feel impossible at times. As I said, the game is short. There's even an achievement for completing the speedrun in under 12 minutes. That should give you an idea of the length of this game. Still, it took me a little over 5 hours to get 18/19 achievements. It's also worth noting that the soundtrack is fantastic.\n\nConclusion:If you're a fan of platformers, I'd definitely recommend this. It's a short game, but it's well worth the price it's listed. If you're looking for a story, this doesn't have one. However, if you just want a good platformer that's moderately challenging, I think you'll enjoy it.","August 7, 2015","true","6.1"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","17","17","2","0"

The ability to select individual levels to play (after you beat the game) is particularly useful for practise.\n\nOverall this is one of my favourite games aesthetically, and I always end up spending a little more time on it than I intend to.

You have your movement keys, jump and the ability to set a respawn point - now get to the end.\n\nThere are 12 levels in the main game + 10 extra ones that aren't in the main exe for some reason. It can be beaten easily in 30 minutes if you take your time and speedruns usually take 10 minutes. The fun I found in LOVE was the race to get a better score and speedrun it as fast as possible, coupled with some hidden achievements and Its a party. There's a one life only mode for the truly badass people out there - also fun to play with friends and see who can get the furthest.\n\nFor such a small game, I wouldn't expect the soundtrack to be so diverse but surprisingly Its quite listenable and I wouldn't mind having it in my library of game soundtracks. Calm, smooth and complimenting the 8bit art style.\n\nAlthough unnecessary, I'd still love the see the ability to rebind keys and steam workshop support for custom levels would really be the icing on the cake.

Its visuals don't exactly demand attention, and to an outsider probably seems just another soulless 2D platformer which would be better served adorning a no-name website as a free flash game than something they'd want to pay for. But like the polygonal twitch-fest I mentioned earlier, what sets Love apart is its attention to detail; the way it feels, how well each level is designed, and the potential that waiting just below the service that make it far more than the average browser-based diversion.\n\nIt shouldn't be unexpected, but you should know Love is not a long game. It consists of twelve short levels which can be blown through in about 20-30 minutes your first time. This is intentional however as you aren't meant to playthrough the game once and be done with it, but return again and again to aim for higher scores, faster times, and a better ranking. This is the focus of Love and why the short levels work so well; it makes it extremely easy to jump back in for a quick run every now and then to better your time, without having to commit hours to what could potentially be no better than the last time you played. I'm not typically a fan of speedrunning, but I've already gone through Love four times and definitely see myself coming back for more.\n\nNone of this would matter though if it wasn't for how well constructed the different aspects of Love are. Each level is unique in both structure and visual design, and yet they fit together perfectly and compliment each other with their diverse layouts. Similarly the graphics are very basic, but there's a subtle elegance to the way the character moves; how the different environment colors contrast to outline traps and the path forward and how the excellent soundtrack perfectly matches the mood of them, from melancholy ambiance to hyperactive electronica. The controls are sharp, whether using a controller or keyboard (the latter of which I rarely will even attempt to use), and something about the way you move just "feels right".\n\nI'll come out and say I, ahem, Love Love. It surprised me with its addictive and refined design, and has me eager to see what developer Fred Wood has planned for future updates. There is a ton of potential here for such a seemingly simple game and I have no doubt he is going to tap into it, already showing an admiral dedication to patching out bugs and adding in features that didn't make it right at launch. Love might not be a long game, or a very deep one, but it is certainly a very enjoyable little slice of platforming that is well worth the very low cost of admission.","February 24, 2014","true","1.2"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","3"

There are some achievements and secrets but i think the replay value is rather low, there is a mode with infinite lives, and a mode with just 1 life as well as a speedrun mode but i think they all play on the same set of levels.\n\nMaybe not a game i would buy at full price because it is so short but if you like platformers and the game is on sale go for it.","January 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

Indeed, it is quite the short game, as I was able to complete it in one session, about a half hour long. That said though, I'm a believer in quality over quantity. I've noticed this game to be quite difficult, as I lost most of my lives in my playthrough, but it wasn't impossibly nor frustratingly difficult. Perhaps it was a lovely music or nostalgia from old-school gaming that took frustration away. I'm someone who grow up with the old games, so I think this is a nice trip back to the past, but with a few modern things added to it to give it a bit more flavor. All in all, I enjoyed my session with this game and wouldn't mind giving it another go eventually, whether on a day I'm just bored and want some fun or have a challenge at going at the game with just one life.","January 31, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","1"

Simple platforming.\n\nThis is exactly how LOVE shines. Despite garnering somewhat of a reputation for being difficult, it is fair and surprisingly humble. There are no nasty tricks in any of the levels; what you see and anticipate is what you get. The game is minimalistic in its pixel appearance, but quickly apparent that it's not in any cliché sense of retro appeal. It is a subtly stylish game that excels in presenting simple, clean platforming concepts through bite-sized, themed levels. LOVE is even confident enough in its design to allow for manual checkpoint placement in every level, and it works. I have to add that the soundtrack is also pretty fantastic, and helps LOVE maintain a fascinating, enigmatic atmosphere alongside the deliberately minimal visuals.\n\nLOVE is short yet succinct, and a great deal for the price it asks.","February 19","true","2.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It contains 16 levels, 7 "remix" levels and speedrun mode among other features. The game currently stands at Very Positive with 90%. It uses retro-styled graphics and has a semi-futuristic soundtrack. Love tries to be a game which can be easy for beginners, but challenging for veterans. Does it succeed? Yes, it does. It accomplishes this task through the different modes it has. These include, Easy, Arcade, Yolo, Speedrun and Remix mode. Easy allows new players to play until they get the feel for the game, before moving onto playing Arcade or Speedrun, and then if you're really good; you should be able to complete Yolo mode.\n\n\nProsNice unique art style\nGreat for speedrunners\nNice music at first\nCan be casual and competitive\nEaster eggs and  shortcuts\nConsMusic gets repetitive\nNot much replay value for a casual player\nNo save button or access to options menu while playing.\nIn conclusion I can say that Love is a fairly challenging and fun game. It provides plenty of uniqueness and fun for players, although it isn't replayable for casuals. Overall this game is good for anyone who's looking for a nice platformer to play while taking a break from whatever else they're playing at the time.\n\n\n\n[/table]For more reviews on all the best Steam games, please check out my curator pages.http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11680266/If you're a developer and want your game to be reviewed; I accept keys for that purpose.

Players are able to drop down checkpoints where they please (as long as it's on a stable surface), effectively minimizing the amount of redoing you'll need to do. Higher difficulties limit these checkpoints (or outright forbid them), but I loved (pun not intended) that there was a more friendly mode as well.\n\nThere isn't much else to say. The levels are varied and the game in total does not outstay its welcome.\nI'd like respawn systems like this to be in more games, especially skill-based ones, it was definitely the highlight of this game for me.\nRecommended as long as you don't expect length, a plot or an explanation of the game's title.","May 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Of course, the real fun is going through it and trying to better your score, so YMMV\n- There is one level where it's possible to set a respawn point and make the game unwinnable.

Recommended for hardcore gamers that want to have more from the game in Yolo or Speedrun mode. Game is without a story but that makes it special to create/imagine your own story for yourself while playing. You can make your own levels with paint or photoshop, i`m curious to try this but its not neccesary to have alot more levels since i like minimalistic games, sometimes its better having less than abundance.","June 14, 2014","true","18.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The music is comforting and relaxing and the deaths do not punish you as any level platform you can set your respawn on with no penalty to gameplay. I played it with my 7yr old son who picked up each levels mechanics so fast it surprised me seeing him finish a few levels when I was playing was a great experience.\n\nThe levels look simple, accuracy is the key and the layer movement is totally in your hands allowing you to correct the trajectory as you go (which also means, when you die it is your fault, and not rage inducing).  The aesthetics are perfectly suited to the game and I have enjoyed this a lot more than I feel I would have.\n\nIf you are after a fun platformer that will reward your persistence and attention to the levels, this should draw you in. Super Meat Boy is a comparison but I don't feel it is a fair one as SMB relishes punishing you at every turn to make you respawn and repeat (giving you surprise and cheap feeling deaths) this on the other hand has few of these so far and the mechanics feel solid.\n\nI played this with a 360 gamepad and controls were perfect, the sense of movement really felt spot on and accurate.","March 17, 2014","true","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Finally picked it up for under a buck, and I gotta say I am quite dissapointed for even that low of a price. This is something I would expect to be a free flash game. It tries hard. I mean the effort is there, but because it is soooo directly comparable to many other games, it falls seriously short. I mean the soundtrack is ok in places, but overall meh. The platforming is easy, and very standard. This game brings *nothing* new to the genre. I just wish it weren't so flippin' similiar to VVVVVV (which is pure art).\n\nI also question the odd developement decision to make the suicide one button, and the respawn set two. Did anyone really need a suicide button? I never used it, but I certain reset my spawn every 10 feet which was made laborious by having to push two buttons instead of one.\n\nI also wonder if this game could benefit from not giving the player a set number of lives, but a set number of times they can reset their spawn.\n\nI would stay away from this one for all of the reasons above, plus its under an hour of gameplay from start to finish.","October 15, 2014","false","0.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","12","22","2","0"

Most of the levels are fairly by-the-numbers explorations of a single mechanic, using mostly horizontal platforms. It's a shame, because when it deviates from this formula the game comes into its own. In particular, the level "Belly of the Beast" (pictured on one of the trading cards) is fantastic, and shows how rewarding platforming can be when exploring the level is its own reward. If the rest of the game had been up to that standard, I would recommend it unreservedly.\n\nStill, it's a fun experience, with responsive controls and a good soundtrack.","October 15, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The interesting part of this game is that you have the option to set a respawn point whenever you want, but at the cost of a lower final score if you constantly set spawns. The game boasts several different modes including the standard mode, in which you must finish the game with 100 lives, and the speedrun mode, where you must finish the game as fast as possible.\n\nPROS:\n- An abundance in variety of obstacles between the levels, no 2 levels feel the same\n- Difficult at times, yet not unfair\n- Very fluent controls\n- Majority of the levels have a smooth soundtrack\n- Very reasonable price\n- Features software which allows you to create your own levels\n\nCONS:\n- Not choc-a-bloc with content\n- First time players might lose patience with some of the later levels\n- Can get boring after long sessions\n\nVERDICT:\nLove pretty much flawlessly does what it set out to do, the solid platforming combined with the chill soundtrack makes for a cheap, fun game which serves a great way to kill 15-30 minutes a day.","November 1, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Anyone who can complete the game (which, by the way doesn't take that long) has achieved something.\n\nThere is a variation of game-modes in which you can choose from, from "Easy Mode", to "YOLO Mode" this game can keep you busy for hours.

Sure, it looks like it belongs to the Pre-Commodre 64 era (Pre-8 bit for you youngins), but that doesn't hurt it one bit; the dangers and other elements are painfully clear due to the simple contrasts of the restricted colour scheme and well, if you need your 2D platformers to be pretty all the time then you should turn away now.\n\nLove, by Fred Wood & Co., is built to challenge your classic platforming co-ordination and that's mostly what the game consists of, careful timing and just enough foresight and momentum carries the day... or your avatar into death. Rather than use a checkpoint system at set flagged locations like many classics, Love differs in that you can set your respawn points to conserve progress, and even goes so far as to include a suicide option that allows you return to your respawn. It's not necessary but it's handy if you're too bothered to retrace your studious steps; this mode is unavailable in YOLO mode because well, YOLO, but becomes useful to cover mistakes during Speedrun mode.\n\nHowever, if you like your games longer, you should maybe look elsewhere; once you get better at this game, you'll only find yourself clocking it at faster times. If you take into account how long that might take you, well, then thats where this game really sells itself on replayability in the way that many old games with timers would, daring you not to die before it runs out... Only there's no timer counting down, just all the other players to beat... Or just yourself.\n\nPros:\n\n-A challenging Quickplay, designed with 4 modes to cater to multiple player types: Easy for learners, Standard to try to keep 100 lives, YOLO mode for the Carpe Diem in you, and Speedrun for the obvious\n-A brief but informative tutorial mode\n-Features tight controls, unlike the era it imitates graphically\n-Can toggle sounds/music on and off\n-Can adjust to full screen (4:3) or scaled windows (1x-4x)\n-Has a jukebox mode to listen to music\n-Compelling melodic soundtrack, 12 tunes matched to 12 levels\n-Oh yeah, 12 varying levels to master in the original, with an extra 10 added via Love + Custom\n-Controller support\n\nNeutrals (AKA matter of taste/opinion):\n-Atari 2600-esque Retro graphics themes\n-Cheap but well-priced\n\nCons:\n\n-No adjustable volume controls, audio is either off or on\n-No remappable/editable key or button inputs - anyone who doesn't like the control scheme will have to resort to other methods, persist or walk away from the game\n-Lack of internal widescreen support may bother some people\n-Love + Custom lacks controller support and the configuration features of the original executable","February 22, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

For one, I can appreciate any 2D platformer that has the decency to give you a "save anywhere" feature. Mario and Metroid, while fun can be very tiring after playing the same part of a level over and over and LOVE totally cuts that out. I love it. Thank you.\n\nHowever, there isn't a whole lot to recommend beyond the save-anywhere feature. You run and jump. You avoid obstacles in well-designed levels. And that's it. Granted, there are changes to gameplay and obstacles but they're so short that you don't get a feeling of actually mastering them, like in Mario or Metroid.\n\nThat and the fact that the game has 16 levels (well, technically a lot more with the remix mode), despite the changes in speedrun mode and hard mode... there isn't much to LOVE to really find anything special in. Similar to "You Have to Win the Game", LOVE does has smooth controls, a nice graphical aesthetic, and a great difficulty and save feature, but it's so samey and safe that it's just not something you'll want to go back and play in a while. Or at least I don't.\n\nIf you like a fun 2D Platformer, LOVE certainly is that. But beyond the simple mechanics, it's not a particularly memorable experience.

I was just terrible at the timing.\n\n...and then I screwed myself over the second time I played at that level with the platforms you run on and they move for you (its an ice-themed level). I set a respawn point where the platforms don't spawn and died there... then the platform went back to its spawn point and I proceeded to spawn and die endlessly. And that level is right near the end of the game too, so I had to play pretty much all the levels again.\n\nWell, I finally beat it the third time round.\n\nThe soundtrack is good. And very weird. I think that suits the game though.\n\nThere are also some remixed levels of varying difficulty (which I beat without too much trouble after playing through the campaign levels), and extra challenging modes for those who want some replayability such as speedrun and 1-life-only mode.","April 7","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's incredibly short but encourages replays and has a magnificent soundtrack. It's a simple platforming game that lets you drop respawn points anywhere as you go along, aiding in the removal of frustration while playing. You're also given only 100 lives to complete the game with, which may sound like a lot but believe it isn't. This reminds me of a twist between VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy and that's a brilliant thing! For the ridiculously low price I wholeheartedly recommend this. My only criticism would be the music suddenly jumping around from slow and sensitive to fast and action packed and back again as it removes a lot of the emotions of the songs.","February 8, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The trailer gives a good idea of what to expect in terms of minimalist pixel art and atmospheric soundtrack.  Each level has its own feel, and several introduce new gameplay elements - like moving platforms on a track, or falling through the "slow tube" and dodging spikes.\n\nA clever game mechanic is that you can set a respawn point anywhere you stand.  If you use lots of respawn points, you can retry failed jump almost instantly, so the difficulty level is very gentle.  Or, you can try for an A (or A++) score, which means using few or respawns - that takes the difficulty level up closer to Super Meat Boy territory.","February 22, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What's more, this one was originally released before Terry Cavanagh even came up with VVVVVV, so it's definitely a ripoff.

The standard mode you are graded on gives you 100 lives and grades by how many lives and respawn points you use through the 15 or so levels.\n\nThe main glitch is when accessing menus too quickly or when returning to a mode after being in another--it is always better to exit the game to switch modes because the glitch will make the graphics awkwardly flicker.  This never happens sporadically so it is more of a minor annoyance than a gamebreaker.\n\nAll in all it is a nice and short minimalist platformer.","October 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is fairly straightforward, and probably won't give you endless hours of gameplay unless you're a completionist, but I had an unsuccessful go at Standard difficulty, then played Easy (unlimited lives), then straight back to Standard, and am now eyeing up the achievements to see which are within my capability. It's a fun game, of about the perfect length for its price and gameplay style. It does have to be played in one sitting, but if even I can manage that in under half an hour (and I am not good at computer games) then that should be fine for most players, and it has that engagingly moreish level of frustration which keeps you playing without ever crossing the line into painful.\n\nAnother strength of the game is the way it introduces concepts and approaches to you, in particular the bouncing platforms, and then increases the difficulty over subsequent levels. It is also well ramped up difficulty-wise, so that while I can get through the first level without dying, the penultimate one will easily eat a quarter of my total lives.\n\nFor the hardcore there are other modes - both Speedrun and YOLO (which both kind of do what they say on the tin) - as well as scores at the end of the run to attempt to improve, and achievements corresponding to each of these; probably beyond what I personally will aim for due to sheer difficulty, but a good addition for those who want to get more playtime out of this game or just those masochists who like a bit more of a challenge.\n\nI can't comment on the music, as I haven't been able to have my volume on for unrelated reasons, but the art style also lends itself to the game with its simplicity and retro aesthetic. That said, I'm not sure I'd advise it for anyone with epilepsy as there is one section which does appear to almost flash at you as you descend, and I'm not sure whether that could cause problems.\n\nOverall, great fun, eminently moreish and a perfectly positioned short, affordable platformer.","October 21, 2014","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is just like VVVVVVV but it has 4 modes which sets it apart. there is unlimited lives mode . Standard mode : Which is 100 lives . YOLO mode , and speed run mode. the platforming doesnt seem as hard as vvvvvvv because you are not constantly fliping and trying to reorient yourself but it is hard enough. You get repawners and each toime you use a respawner you lose points towards your final score. So if you are a high score perfectionist you should love this.\n\nIts a fun game but with how cheaply it looks like it was made I wouldnt spend more than 5 bucks on it. and thats if you love rage platformers.","July 20, 2014","true","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While very short, (taking a little under an hour to play through your first time), the ability to create your own levels and the challenges they have presented throughout, with most levels hiding cool little secrets, Love keeps you occupied and engaged. While the game is technically done, the makers are consistently adding new stuff and updating quite frequently, so there will always be something to come back to.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. Definitely worth checking out for the insanely low price.","July 28, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It doesn't try to be flashy there are no modern machanics added nor effects to appeal to over and above the basic platforming audience. I've got to admit that I have a very soft spot, for games that pull off the style of old classics of "Bruce Lee", "ManicMiner" and countless others that have excaped me at this point. Of course Love isn't alone in Retro  ZX Spectrum [en.wikipedia.org] gaming homage. Games like "You Have To Win The Game", VVVVVV to name but two notable examples. The game Love is another beautful example of a bygone age in gaming, a simple platformer that would be prefect for speedrunning. The music is one step above what I'd expect from a £1.99 game. If I have to be negative towards Love its unlikely to change the minds that would pass on these kind of games. This is of course,  not the fault of the Developer of Love as the basic platformer is very well nailed down. To round off, all in all I'd recommend me some "Love" while it hands me a pair of rose tinted glasses once again.","February 9, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the game theres no story you bassicly go through stages and thats it but is that bad ? Love is probably one of the best platformers on steam without a doubt. The game is kinda on the short side but thats not bad and this game is actually quite fun and i would suggest you to play through it at least once. Now for the good things. The game is pretty fun but at the same time challenging. The game has an amazing soundtrack which is great to hear once you jump throught the game. Graphics looks amazing for a pixel like game. Now for the bad. The game is incredibly short you can pretty much finish the game in half an hour. Some minor bugs like getting stuck in the enviroments. But thats pretty much it.

Unlike the open-world levels of VVVVVV, Love's are completely "Point A to Point B" from one to the next. There's also a helpful respawn mechanic that allows you to manually place respawn points as you progress, making death less frustrating than in other similar titles. The game is fairly short although I consider that a positive (ideal for short bursts) and totally acceptable given the low pricepoint. Many people should have no problem finishing all 12 levels in under 30 minutes and more experienced players can finish in under 10. Despite the short length, there's a decent amount of replayability thanks to the scoring system that grades you upon completion as well as the speedrun mode. I was also fond of the excellent soundtrack which features a nice mix of soothing and uptempo.\n\nIn all, Love is a fun, simple, and well-designed 2D platformer without any unwanted filler. Absolutely worth the $3 pricetag.","February 15, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Simple? Yes. Confusing story? Indeed. In fact, there is no story. Your hasty legs speed you around world of mystery. Through a blood-red land with giant ornate blades flying through, to an ancient, rotting husk of a prehistoric creature. As you scream at the inescapeable deaths of the elements and your belittled form, you keep with the beat of the ever-pounding soundtrack. It could go from dark and ambient to upbeat and catchy. The game is in no way innovative or original, but is has some special unique charm to it. Maybe it's the industrial levels or the nonstop movement. Maybe if it asks if you love yourself, since you can either kill yourself to get ahead or spare a life for the last moment.

Baby don't hurt....oh, I am sorry. It is not about the song? Okay. Let me start over.\n\nWhat is love? Well, when two people have certain feelings towards each other, they...what, that isn't the topic either?...\n\n...oh, the GAME! Right...\n\nLove is excellent. Fun, hard and forgiving at the same time. A retro-graphics platformer. (retro being pixels. HARD pixels. The bottom soil of the old era.) A playthrough is shorter than the love-kind-relationship that your dog and your guinea pig used to have, but it sounds better and is more fun, and doesn't destroy your furniture.\n\nIt has several game modes, one being the easy (e.g. cheap and no one plays it anyway) mode that gives you unlimited lives (yay, games!) but also a smaller score upon completion. Normal gives you 100 lives and you will get the normal (duh) scoring, depending on how many lives you have, how many spawnpoints you have set (YES YOU CAN SET THEM YOURSELF OMGSLJDESFS) and how fast you were - tons of replay potential.\n\nFor the upcoming sadists, there is a YOLO Mode. Yes, it is called like that. Die once and it is over. Pure madness.\n\nAnd a speedrun mode, which arguably is the most fun mode because you can just get faster and faster and the game is visibly designed around improving your times and erasing mistakes and getting faster. Sonic would be proud, right before the spikes would bury themselves in his soft little fur. Just like your dogs teeth in your guinea pig.\n\nBut anyway, I am in love with love. It is a lovely loveable game. And you will love it too if you like tough as nails but fair platformers and highscores, and if you like to work on your mistakes.\n\nI am out.\n\n","February 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This can't be abused too much, however. In the beggining of the game you can simply set a respawn point after every jump. Later, there are long stretches where you cannot set your respawn points because of the bounce platforms. If you're decent at platformers, the game is actually quite short.

Maybe there is a little replay value, and essentially it is a cheap game, but you might be better off with one of the other meatboy like games, or even meatboy itself.\n\nSaying that though it is early access and could be shaped, but they claim all of the content that will be there is there, so adding length and more difficult later stages to the game would not do anything to aswade this.  Maybe with some user created levels in steam workshop this could have more longevity, but the whole point of a challenge game like this is to beat it, and I've done that easily, Im not one of these 1 life run people, but I expect the normal mode to offer more challenge than this in a game of this style.\n\nThe game is also fairly linear so you have a single path through the game, whereas something like I wanna be the guy there are a number of other paths you can take as well as hidden secret items which extend longevity, things the developer can think of adding, and if these increase the game cost, I always say its better to make a good game that will be played over and over than a quick cheap one someone will play for 22 minutes and no more.\n\nSo at the current state, with 12 levels, which lets face it some of them weren't as difficult later as they perhaps should've been I cannot recommend this game unless its on sale and you fancy a cheap quick thrill.  There are other games of the type you'd spend far longer on with similar investment and have far more fun with.","February 9, 2014","false","1.2"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","5","20","0","0"

You may notice that both are hardcore platformers!\n\nAnyway, Love is pretty difficult, but it has one redeeming feature - you can place respawn points along levels and whenever you die you restart from there.\n\nThe 12 levels can be completed in around 20-25 minutes on your first playthrough. But there's quite a bit of replay value here as you attempt to then complete the whole game in 100 deaths or less, and then complete it in under 10 minutes. Finally, there's the objective to complete it without dying, but I'm not sure if I wanna put myself through that torture!\n\nGraphics are just ok. Nothing to swoon over, but it does it job alright. I am personally not a fan of this visual style, but can live with it. Soundtrack is good. Some of the tracks are indeed memorable, but nothing ultimately out of this world.\n\nCurrently, there is an issue with the controls for me personally. Jumping while moving doesn't feel consistent. Hopefully it gets fixed and if it does I'll update my review here.\n\nIs it worth $2 or $3? If you're a fan of platformers, I guess so. Some nice achievements to aim for and easter eggs to discover as well. Even if you are not a precision platformer fan, you can still get this as its infinite respawn points feature should help you complete the game.","February 8, 2014","true","7.6"," 7 of 63 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","7","63","0","2"

The respawn system and level select both help in learning the levels and the levels aren't stupidly precise or really too challenging your first time through anyways. There's a few issues with blind jumps but aside from those it's all pretty great. Each of the 12 levels is unique and the developer did well to cram as many ideas as possible into a small game like this. The graphics are also pretty nice for their style, not blocky and ugly like a lot of games adopting a "retro' style feel they need to be.

Lemur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nalgasdlemur/","949 products in account","It's always a good sign when I forget to either keep playing a game or retire it for a couple weeks straight. I did genuinely enjoy playing through this a couple times, and I was at least considering sticking with it a bit longer to improve my time/die less, but it completely slipped my mind after a day or so. Guess it made less of an impression than I thought. I do like some of the level design, and the respawn mechanic and extremely generous number of lives make it relatively easy to complete the game but incentivize you to not abuse either if you want to be competitive at all, because you're penalized if you do. That's pretty well thought out and makes it very accessible to learn the level layouts but still requires a decent amount of skill to do well at. Yay for good design decisions.","February 24, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How far can you get? That's the concept. There's an element of exploration and satisfaction that comes into play from getting to that next level and having to figure out how to best solve the next given platforming challenge with the least number of deaths and respawns placed (not to mention speed, cause doing stuff fast is dope.) Before you know it you're finding the optimal paths through each level and building runs to try and improve your end game score. Of course, since the creed of this game is its minimalism, it becomes exponentially smaller the second you figure out a particular segment, and while some might consider this a flaw I absolutely do not. How long I played a simple game like this, how much thought I put into and how much pure fun I had with it is a testament to how great all of these minimalist pieces of it work together. And I'm still chasing that YOLO run! I love Love and I think you will too so just stop reading this and give it a dang try right now.","February 16, 2014","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the press of a button, you set down a new check-point, and if you die, you respawn at the checkpoint you set.\n\nAt first this seems to be an easy way to essentially breeze through the game, but in later levels you have less and less areas to place your check-points that are safe, or possible at all.  For instance, a long sequence of bouncing on platforms gives you no opportunity to make the check-point you so desperately desire.\n\nThe system works really well, and leads to a pretty fun little game.\n\nThe level design is creative and interesting.  My favorite levels are feel like they could be a part of something larger.  There is a hint of a greater universe that is never shown to us, and isn't meant to be known.\n\nAll of this, and if you're interested in speed-running, the game has a built in speed-runner mode.  The interplay between the check-point mechanic and speed-running works rather well, so this is a welcome addition, and should give you a good reason to replay.\n\nAll together, I would definitely recommend this game, especially considering the low price being asked for it.","April 25, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How far can you get? That's the concept. There's an element of exploration and satisfaction that comes into play from getting to that next level and having to figure out how to best solve the next given platforming challenge with the least number of deaths and respawns placed (not to mention speed, cause doing stuff fast is dope.) Before you know it you're finding the optimal paths through each level and building runs to try and improve your end game score. Of course, since the creed of this game is its minimalism, it becomes exponentially smaller the second you figure out a particular segment, and while some might consider this a flaw I absolutely do not. How long I played a simple game like this, how much thought I put into and how much pure fun I had with it is a testament to how great all of these minimalist pieces of it work together. And I'm still chasing that YOLO run!

Reminds me of a Terry Cavanagh game like VVVVVV. I'd love to play a sequel with way more levels and unlimited lives.

Level design is interesting and the music is very stylish. Its replay value might not be enough for most people, even with all the levels and game modes available, but it only costs 2.99$, which is great.  I'm still having a good time with this game. Recommended.","May 4","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only complaint is that it's pretty short, and even that is offset by its low price.","May 22","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level environments are lovely to look at.\n\nIt's difficult to beat, but not impossible, unless you're playing yolo mode. I felt likt it was much easier and fluid with a controller.\n\nThe music is super catchy and cute.\n\nSpeedrun mode is a lot of fun; it brings back that feeling of learning a mario level from the inside out and just flying past it.\n\nReally fun! Go support the devs by buying this game!","May 24","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
