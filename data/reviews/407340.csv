I personally really enjoyed this visual novel with its cheerful tone! For those familiar with ebi-hime's previous works, which are generally more dark in tone, this VN may seem quite different in terms of style but I was not disappointed for sure. I'd sum this VN up as silly cuteness, food scenes making me very hungry, and fluffiness that made me melt~\n\nThoughts, story wise:Strawberry Vinegar follows the life of Rie, a young girl that is quite sarcastic, cynical, and sassy as we can see throughout the VN. (At age 9, she's read The Capitalist Manifesto, Adler and Kelso, 1958.) One day she finds an intruder in her house stealing her cookies, who is none other than the young demon, Licia. Through some strange circumstances Licia ends up staying with Rie's family for a week, learning about human customs and eating lots of food, described in exquisite detail, accompanied with amazing artwork by Silly Selly.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=595423904\n\nRie's parents are a very endearing couple, and we see the four of them (Rie, Licia, Parents) interact in their daily life. Rie and Licia get to know each other better, and depending on Rie's choices during the game, there may be romantic feelings between Rie and Licia. You can even die in this game though, if you anger some other demons... Overall the story is lighthearted and gave me quite a lot of laughs, with some extra cute fluffy scenes, and made me very hungry during the food scenes.\n\nThoughts, game play wise:This visual novel features 5 endings (or 6?) with multiple branching storylines - I finished one route and went for another and was pleasantly surprised that they did indeed quite branch out with lots of content I hadn't seem in the other route. Overall this isn't a very long game, about 5 hours for my first route (romance), There are quite a few extras, such as author's notes and music, as well as CGs (FOOD screenshots!)\n\nOne thing I think worth mentioning though is that the light coloured font and the also light coloured text box made it a bit difficult to read initially, so I had to take some time to get used to it and it was better after reading for some time.\n\nFinal thoughts:I enjoyed this visual novel, between the cuteness and food, Strawberry Vinegar brought a smile to my face. For those that came to this game from Ebi-hime's previous works such as Asphyxia, just a heads up though this game is much different in tone. Ebi-hime is an excellent writer, so reading this visual novel was a pleasure and the artwork is gorgeous, perfectly bringing out the personalities of the characters. If you enjoy VNs in general, or lighthearted, cute ones in particular do check this title out.","January 14","true","8.0"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","35","36","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/recommended/407340/","azusa_twin","ティアラ μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/","244 products in account","Strawberry Vinegar is a sweet and lighthearted visual novel with yuri elements, featuring 6 endings and depending on your choices it will change the outcome of the story. Developed by ebi-hime and published by Sekai Project. The story is written by Ebi-hime, the creator of Asphyxia and The way we ALL GO.\n\nThe storySakuraba Rie, aged nine, is a cynical and grumpy girl who cares little for her fellow classmates, and does not have a single friend.\nThat is, until a self-proclaimed demon named, Licia,  from the deepest, darkest pits of Hell suddenly appears in Rie’s kitchen and steals a tray of cookies Rie just baked! Through some “convincing” Lucia managed to get lodging in Rie’s home for 6-7 days.  “Feed me, or I’ll reap your soul!” – Licia\nWhat will happen between these two young girls? Will friendship blossom between them, or perhaps something more darker?\nThat is up to the reader to decide – but rest assured, no matter what, there will lots and lots of delicious food!\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual Elements – Wow what do I say for this? The visual elements is provably the most distinctive feature in the particular visual novel I absolutely love the artwork and art style by Silly Selly the artist of Strawberry Vinegar the art is beautifully detailed, and it is very expressive which is very different that most visual novels out there. CGs, CGs of food and sprites are all extremely detailed detailed to the point where the CGs of food looks so delicious that I wish I was the one eating them instead of reading about them being eaten.[Warning – do not play when you are hungry.]\n\nAudio - As you can see the music used in this visual novel [strawberry vinegar] are all named after food and my particular favorite is “chrysanthemum tea”. The audio is good all of them cue in at the right time fitting into the environment and mood of the visual novel\n\nTo sum upI would definitely recommend this visual novel to anyone who is a fan of Ebi-Hime works and to people who loves yuri because hints of yuri [me] can be found in the visual novel here and there. Some things I noticed when playing through is that there are anime references that could be found in Strawberry vinegar which is really cool I found a few but I am sure that there are more and I have missed them these are what I have found. “I am the bone of my sword” and “Unlimited blushing works” both are referencing to the Fate franchise and Obviously comiket.\n\nClick here for a review full and images![azusantiara.wordpress.com]","January 22","true","10.0"," 28 of 28 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","28","28","5","0"

For the next week (6 days, because weeks don't have 7 days in Hell), Licia will be living with Rie and her family, and yes - there will be lots of food.\n\nStrawberry Vinegar is one of my favourite VN's I've read, despite how hungry it made me. The artwork is extremely charming, and the characters are very likeable. There are 6 endings to aim for in the game, and each is sure to make your mouth water with how much food you are shown. I did find some minor odd spelling issues (such as "parents" in place of "patients"), but they didn't detract from the story too much.\n\nI highly suggest this game to anyone who loves food and/or good stories. There is some hint of female love, especially in some of the endings, but considering for the bulk of the game Rie and Licia are 9, don't expect much.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a key by the publisher for review purposes.","January 15","true","9.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The demon says to stay at her home for 6 days (as apparently there is only 6 days in hell, not 7). They both get to know each other, first they start to hate each other, but later in the VN, they start to love each other and show affection to each other. I mean, it even gets to the point where you think a Yuri scene is about to pop up any moment….I mean there are some that do, so don’t be disappointed (I definitely bought this for the plot, right?)\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nIf you have read the Visual Novels’ Asphyxia and/or The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns you might be familiar with the graphics, as they are made by the same people. The artwork really shows bright images of the girls and the environment they’re in, they did a great job in terms of the visuals in this novel. The drawing of the girls doesn’t really follow the same “anime-like” appearance as other VNs, which felt unique in its own way, but it also felt “out of place” for me as I wasn’t quite used to it at the beginning.\n\nBut overall it delivers a nice artwork for the characters and the environment, great job on this one.\n\nStoryline: 8/10\nI have already mentioned some of it above. But in terms of “in depth story” it doesn’t go far and long, in fact this VN has really fast pacing and really quick character development, so if you wanted a long, in depth story VN, sadly this is not for you. But for the others, it delivers a nice empathises on both of the girls as they go on about their day. Also, to mention Rie made her first friend EVER! In her life, that is of course the demon she met, who broke into her home and started eating cookies…well, I guess you can also make friends that way huh, who would’ve thought.\n\nOverall, the novel shows us a story of two girls who show love and affection to each other as the VN progresses on and it portrays their everyday life and show their own personal character development.\n\nSound: 4/10\nNothing of the amazing to hear in this novel, there is only ever so many soundtracks until you start hearing the same ones that you heard 2-3 scenes ago. However, some are really nicely done, but I wouldn’t say all of them are of “high quality” though. Some of the soundtracks don’t even fit particular scenes, but eh, what can you do?\n\nOverall, the soundtrack is quite a let-down. It doesn’t offer much for the reader as some don’t even match the scene.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nThe VN offers the basic options in the menu which could alterate your VN experience. It at least has the SHIFT + TAB overlay support which I really liked, but it only worked when you had a high enough frame rate (Between 30-60 FPS), otherwise it wouldn’t function, or sometimes it would work, but it would lag the game or lag the overlay.\n\nOverall, it only offers basic options and gameplay aspects. But this is enough for this kind of VN.\n\nPrice: 10/10\nAt £6.99 this is a great price for this VN. Any higher than £10 would not have been worth buying at all. This is great to see as many VNs of this length are overpriced despite offering the same features, I’ll give this VN full marks here.\n\nOverall at the price, you get what you pay for, it’s not too low or too high. This is a great price point for this VN.\n\nConclusion\nIt is a decent VN with good artworks and a taste of Yuri. That is all I can say for that one. I can only recommend the VN if you are into fast paced stories, cute girls and VNs in general. This is NOT for the “serious” reader if you know what I mean.\n","February 10","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Strawberry Vinegar is an extremeley light-hearted VN that centers around the friendship/relationship of two nine year old girls, one of which being a demon who likes to eat alot of food. I found the writing to be very well done, and kept me entertained and immersed into the story from beginning to end. The characters are very few, but all offer their own quirks and play off eachother very well. The artwork here is all very gorgeous and the CGs of the food WILL make you hungry by the end.\n\nI completed my first playthrough in just under seven hours and found it to be well worth the price. The game has multiple endings and while it is not necesserily Yuri themed, the game DOES include a romance ending. This isn't a VN with any serious drama or plot twists, but if you're looking for an extremely cute and light-hearted story, then this game is probably for you.","January 22","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While not long, it is stuffed full of beautiful art, cute characters, delicious food, and good feels.  I caught some bad ends early on and while that could have been frustrating under most circumstances, the way they were delivered made me realize that I had to think about how my character would act for each choice, as a gloomy reclusive 9-year-old girl.  That realization helped me feel more invested in the characters and in guiding them well.\n\nThe CG art is beautiful and plentiful, featuring some of the most beautiful hand-drawn renders I have seen.  The character sprites are expressive and varied.  The music, while it doesn't stand out, suits the scenes and events perfectly.  The characters themselves are interesting and engaging, although they may not be as easy to identify with for someone not familiar with anime tropes.\n\nI chose to play one game "day" per real day.  This made the individual play sessions no more than an hour, but each day as work wound down I found myself looking forward to getting home so I could play again.  I do strongly recommend this game.\n\nHowever, despite the high production values, at a release price of 10USD I feel the game would be better served listing a few dollars cheaper, due to its brevity.  My second recommendation is to wishlist the game, and buy it as soon as it receives a discount, because the experience it delivers really is very very good.","May 21","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
