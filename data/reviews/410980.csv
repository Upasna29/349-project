Master of Orion 2 is a timeless 4x with a near perfect balance of features, options, events, and challenges that will keep you coming back for more years later even.

It's got it all, heroes, alien races, ship design, colony management, espionage, diplomacy, research, exploration and explotation. You will colonize planets, invade planets, bombard planets, or destroy planets. You'll go from researching technology to create farms in planets with no atmosphere to developing the means to turn a radioactive planetoid into a Gaia class homeworld for your race to live in.\n\nYou'll meet telephathic races, smart races, dumb races, mineral races, cyborgs, cat people and maybe even the Phobos leather godesses cousins. If you like them, you can ally with them. Or you can destroy their ships, enslave their population, and exterminate them. Or go anywhere in betwen.\n\nYou could be the next galactic chancellor. Or you could be the last man standing. You could steal Orion's secrets for yourself. You can even invade other dimensions in your endless quest to crush aliens like bugs.\n\nYour marines will take out enemy forces, colonies, rebellions and even fight enemy crews if you happen to board your opponents ships.\n\nWould you build a doomstar to take the heat onto their homeworld, or fortify your own worlds while you hire spies and terrorists to dismantle their planets from within ? Who knows, they may blame someone else. You could even hire that telepath hero to help with the efforts.\n\nThe amount of choice in this game is astounding. Only two cons for me :\n\n1 Turn based combat is excellent at the beginig and middle game. On the later stage, where you have 40 vs 38 battle regularly and each ship has to take a turn, you'd rather click auto-resolve.\n2 Diplomacy is a bit unpredictable at times, then other times you can just trick the cpu into giving all away.\n\nOther than that, this game is *for me* superior to every other space empire strategy game except perhaps it's predecesor, Master of Orion, but that, is a matter of taste.","March 2","true","2.0"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","36","36","3","2"

If you like strategy, or video games, you won't be disappointed.\n\nHistory: MOO2 is almost 20 years old now (originally released in 1996) and it's still considered by most strategy gamers to be one of (if not THE) finest strategy game ever made. It was developed by Sid Meier's old company Microprose, and shared many programmers and developers with the early Civilisation games. One of the developers that worked on Civ2 (also released by Microprose in 1996) said that when you win a tech victory in Civ2, and your rocket ship takes off to reach for the stars, Master of Orion 2 is what happens next.\n\nModern 4X space games are pretty much all based on the blueprint of Master of Orion 1&2, and yet none have surpassed it's perfect balance of strategy, depth, personality, optimisation and fun. And I know, I've played almost all them, from Space Empires, to Civ, to Stardrive and Endless Space via Total War and Sins of a Solar Empire, the list goes on and on, but this game; this game is the best.\n\nEverything that people complain about with 4x games these days is often because it's been done better in MOO2. The main game interface is accessible and easy to pick up. There's numbers, but it's easy to understand what they mean. You have important decisions to make right from the start about what direction to send your empire in. The diplomacy matters. The races have personality. The research you choose really matters, and you have tough decisions every time you research a tech field. There's freighters and starbases  and farming and economy and morale and espionage, and it's all important, and it's all perfect. Not too complex, not too simple.\nThe turn-based tactical combat is tense and strategic, you get attached to your ships because you put every gun and system on that ship, you chose it's appearance and named it yourself, you spent the last 20 minutes building it and you know how it should be used in combat. This ain't no point n' click rts, it's fun, it's deep, and it's tactical.\nThis game has it all, and it does it all really, really well.\n\nI've been a gamer all my life, I've played hundreds of games and this is my favourite game ever. Simply wonderful.","March 6","true","1.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","1"

I played the hell out of the orion series but 2 was by far the best (with certain specific components of 3 being better, but less cohesive). If you haven't played it the game will seem pretty dated but the core of it is something that 4x games should seek to emulate and improve upon.\n\nIf the team that is developing the new version is using this as a starting point, then we're in for a real successor to the franchise, but it will be hard to capture the same magic.","February 27","true","0.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devinescence/recommended/410980/","devinescence","DevinUp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devinescence/","227 products in account","This is my favorite game of all time. I bought it on CD when it first came out and played a ton of it as a kid. It has been installed on every computer I've owned since that time. I have also purchased it from GOG and as part of the collector's edition of the new Master of Orion. It has aged quite well and is still an enjoyable game to play in 2016.\n\nThis is one of the grandfathers of the turn-based strategy genre and if you've ever heard of the term 4x strategy, it comes from this game. You eXpand, eXplore, eXploit, and eXterminate. You start with one planet and scout nearby planets and colonize them in an attempt to grow your empire. Along the way, you'll need to research new technologies, build fleets, train spies, build improvements on your planets, engage alien races in diplomacy, and whatever else it takes to ensure that your empire thrives.\n\nThe game is fairly intuitive and you should get the basic idea of how to play after a game. Individual games can take several hours like a game of Civilization. There is a great custom race editor that allows you to tweak your own race with attributes that go well with your play style. It's a fun and epic game with some really nice background music. The turn-based ship battles are pretty fun as well.\n\nI don't know if this will release as a standalone game later on, but if not, you can always get MOO1+2 at GOG. If you don't mind the outdated graphics, this is a fun strategic space game that will make you want to click next turn just one more time.\n\nFavorite game of all time/10","March 9","true","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
