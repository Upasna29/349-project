If you enjoy a good story, this game has a brilliant plot and some very nice "a-ha!" moments as the mystery unfolds.\n\nThe puzzles are very interesting and fun to solve, but you do have to get over the awful movement system. Sometimes you forget to pick an item here or to talk to someone there and cue to 2 or 3 minutes of walking around to get there, constantly cursing at the awful interface to do so. But the stress is worth it for the story.\n\nWorth the money if it's on a sale, can be beat in 10-15 hours.","November 7, 2015","true","11.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","0"

It is by no means perfect, with occasional bugs and awkward movement controls that will occasionally have you wanting to throw your mouse through a window, but worth checking out. Through the game you get a rich sense of the world, told to you through hints and mentions in conversation rather than the heavy-handed exposition we see in most similar games.","February 17","true","14.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you find it on a half price sale it is worth considering.\n\nThe premise of this game is that you are a man in New York who, soon after moving into a new apartment, observes a police squad forcefully arresting and abducting his neighbour while his terrified wife amd son look on. In your attempt to support the man's family you discover all sorts of strange facts that suggest dark and conspiratorial motives for his arrest.\n\nThe gameplay is that of a traditional point and click adventure. Most of the plot advancement is through conversation and exploring. There are some inventory based puzzles too, but not enough in my opinion.\n\nThe good:\nDespite the occasional weak translations (to English) the characters are believable and the voice acting is pretty good.\nThe plot is engaging and sensible and doesn't leave any unanswered questions.\nObject based puzzles are sensible.\n\nThe bad:\n-The pathing is terrible. It is downright  difficult to transition between some screens and the main character will sometimes run around in a circle before going where you want him to.\n\n-The scenery involves huge areas that take ages to get across and redundant screens. This makes moving between locations tedious and annoying. This actively ruins one of the better puzzles because it takes a couple of minutes to go from the place where you push a button to the place where you get feedback.\n\n- Advancing the plot relies heavily on triggers. Sometimes those are sensible (like interrogating a character to reveal a new location) but some triggers are completely irrelevant to the plot (for example you know what to do and where to go but you can't do it until you've talked to your friend in the office, who has nothing whatsoever to do with the story).\n\n\nI got this in a sale so I'm not disappointed  I bought it but it is thoroughly mediocre.","April 9, 2015","false","109.2"," 31 of 60 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","31","60","3","0"

As you trying to find the next thing you're supposed to be doing you have to go back and forth several times between your apartment and the street below.\n\nEach time you have to wait for the elevator to go up and down all 23 floors. EVERY TIME! WTF!!!!","April 30","false","1.7"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","1","9","2","0"
