You can pretty much boil them down to 3 sections: Gameplay, Story, and Graphics. Luckily for Point 'n' Click games though, these sections can be very diverse topics! So, Ballads of Reemus, the best way to put the gameplay - such as the puzzles and the overall progression of the game - is that it's nonsensical. By this I mean that it's some of the puzzles, and ways to obtain a certain item don't make sense and are... 'Convenient', however, it's not a bad thing, it adds humour the game. Overall, the gameplay is alright, just a little... Random.\n\n\nStory - 9/10:\nThe story is as nonsensical as the puzzles! The characters are great with some good voice acting accompanying them, the progression through the world is great and it takes you to some weird places. The entire world is basically based on taking sayings literally, so for example, the 'Bed Bugs' are massive cockroaches that just sleep all day... And the horse flies... I think you can guess at this point. Overall, I really love the world this is based in, it's basically if a pre-schooler made up their own ideal world with Ice Cream Cacti and Breakfast Trees!\n\n\nGraphics - 6/10:\nThere's not really much to say about the graphics except that it they really remind you of the old school Flash Style, the type you've seen on Newgrounds... In all honesty, I really like these graphics just because of how 'crisp' they look!\n\n\nOverall - 7.3/10:\nI like this game, maybe it's because it's one of the first Point 'n' Click games I've played for a while... Regardless, I enjoyed it, and if you're a fan of Point 'n' Click games then I think you will too! It's about 3 hours long by the way.\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","May 10, 2015","true","3.9"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","44","55","2","0"

Good for people with little experience in adventures.\n- reappearances of known characters (if you played Several Journeys of Reemus)\n- Mini-"Sidequests" (clicking on pieces of something scattered around and then putting them together)\n\nCon:\n\n- no hot-spot feature, which could be useful since some items can be kinda difficult to see.\n- It's short. Took me about 2,5 hours to beat it.\n- while the voice cast itself is pretty good, the quality of their voices could've been better.\n\n\nIf you are interested in this game, I would recommend you to play the "The Several Journeys of Reemus" first. These are free flashgames which you can find on many websites, e.g. www.clickshakegames.com or www.kongregate.com. They give you a pretty good impression how Ballads of Reemus works. If you find yourself enjoy it or are already a fan of the series (like I am): Grab it, it's definitely worth the money.\nI'm really looking forward to Ballads of Reemus 2 now. :)\n","April 28, 2015","true","2.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Little on the shorter side with me finished it in three hours but I'd say it was worth the price. Nice voice acting and pretty entertaining story and puzzles. Would recommend playing the 5 or so flash games first and if you enjoyed them you'll enjoy this one.","May 15, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Διαθέτει έναν πρωταγωνιστή που είναι πραγματικά σκέτη μορφή, καθώς κι έναν συμπαθέστατο sidekick χαρακτήρα. Τα voice overs είναι απολαυστικά, μ’ εμφανή την επιτηδευμένη υπερβολή τους σ’ ορισμένα σημεία.\n\nA short, easy and very pleasant adventure game, that will not make you get stuck anywhere during its 3-hour length.

The puzzles aren't brilliant, but they also don't tend to make you sit there banging every object in the game against each other hoping to stumble over the creator's insane moon logic. The art and music and voice acting have their moments. It's alright, but it doesn't quite make it from "this is not bad" to "this is actively good" as often as I'd like. It was an ok couple of hours though.","August 24, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It'll be the same humour, same voice actors etc., and hopefully alot longer than this.\n\n\nAgain: Not saying that this game is bad, but not very long and therefore not worth the price.","December 17, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is a much bigger adventure starring your favorite exterminator and his bear buddy. A big difference from this game is that it plays a lot more like old click and play games in which you have to travel from different locations to gather objects rather than staying on one screen at a time and voice acting. If you enjoy the Reemus games then this is a must buy. If you are new to the Reemus series I suggest you play the games on Newgrounds before considering buying the game. Whether you're new to the series or not the game contains many laughs and brain teasing puzzles you'd expect from click and play games.","December 24, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the humor in this one and it was easy enough to beat although there were at least 3 puzzles that gave me a hard time most of them were easy to figure out without a walkthrough a rarity in Point & Click games. I look forward to seeing more of his work.","January 9","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
