Well, it's not very good, I don't know what game the other reviewers were playing  but I sure didn't have the same experience.\n\nFirst of all, the animations are great.  I actually admire the amount of work that went into the animations.\n\nBut the game falls short after that.  I didn't find the levels to be very well thought out, basically just a simple straight path with the same enemy types over and over, I got all the way to the first boss, being extremely careful the whole time with hundreds of ammo.  The boss had several attack moves, but easily avoidable, so without missing a single shot, the boss took all of the machine gun ammo and all grenades, leaving me with just a pistol with 1000 ammo in it.  The pistol does not do much damage at all, and it would probably take 20+ minutes of shooting slowly to take him down.  I had to stop after pressing the shoot button a couple hundred times.  It would be a different story if you had the ability to be swapping out weapons or could build up some sort of strategy up to that point, but there's no way to have unlocked something else by this time.  Just sit there and pew-pew-pew your way through, taking tiny scratches off this boss.  It's just boring gameplay all around, and feels unbalanced as though they never even played their game from the start.\n\nOn the third level in the graveyard, there is a giant message that says "SNIPER RIFLE BEST USED HERE" and a picture of a sniper.  But it's not possible to even have a sniper rifle at that stage at all, it's all locked.  You just have to ignore this.\n\nIn your "armory", it lists a number.. mine says 317 right now.  What does it mean, I wonder?  There's no dollar sign or anything beside it, no tool tip, is it money?  Experience?  http://i.imgur.com/MGHIdsd.jpg\n\nIn addition to that, there are buttons in the menu to join online servers but none of them work.  When you first boot up the game, it says "CONNECTION STATUS: Disconnected" in the top left corner.  But it's not possible to actually connect to anything, I tried every single server.  Not a huge issue, though.\n\nWhen you press the escape key in-game, it brings up the menu.  But it doesn't pause the gameplay at all?  I guess the developer hasn't figured out how to do that yet.  Not an issue for online games as it wouldn't make sense to pause it, but for single player matches it's awful to have no way to pause what you are doing.\n\nThere are just weird problems everywhere, like if you click on the options menu, it reads "create room" on top, for no reason at all.  That's how rushed of a release this is, they didn't even check over the options menu for obvious mistakes.\n\nSo, overall I found the game to be very poorly made, yet it shows promise.  They could turn it around and fix things...  but then now let's talk about the real reason I came here to complain.  I smell something fishy.\n\nFirst of all, the whole store page is full of positive reviews on the very first day, everyone is just LOVING this game, somehow.  We've got steam accounts that only have 1 or maybe 2 games in it, buying this game and reviewing it.  Steam accounts that have ONLY started playing games on the day of Burgers' release.  That's highly suspicious.\n\nSecondly, I videotaped myself playing the game, and my content was banned from the community.  http://i.imgur.com/W48hxoW.jpg  I recieved an email saying I was banned because my video "violates the Steam Terms of Service."  Well, here's that video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0a7s1NkODs\n\nWhat, exactly, is violating the terms of service in that video?\n\nHere are the guidelines: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=4045-USHJ-3810\n\nDo not do any of the following:\nFlame or insult other members I did not do this.\nBypass any filters I did not do this.\nAbuse or encourage abuse of the Reputation, or Post Reporting Systems I did not do this.\nPost personally identifiable information (i.e. name, address, email, phone number, etc.) I did not do this.\nBump threads I did not do this.\nDerail a thread's topic I did not do this.\nPost links to phishing sites I did not do this.\nPost spam (i.e. +1, 10char, rickrolls) or Re-post Closed, Modified, Deleted Content I did not do this.\nRepetitively post in the incorrect forum (example: trade requests belong in trading forum) I did not do this.\nOpenly argue with a moderator I did not do this.\nSo, as you can see, a simple "let's play" video should not be banned for violating the terms of service.  The developer clearly saw that I was having a less-than-stellar gaming experience and figured that they would lie to the Steam moderators in hopes to get my video removed.  This is dishonesty, and further goes to show you how low these developers will go to get content removed from their hub.\n\nI do NOT recommend people to buy this game.","August 12, 2015","false","2.1"," 187 of 222 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","187","222","10","46"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/385830/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer/publisher.\nBurgers is a side scrolling action game, developed and published by storm_sharks.  I am going to start out by saying, from the screenshots this game reminded me a lot of games like Castle Crashers, and Metal Slug, so was quite excited to try it out. Sadly what followed was quite possibly one of my worst gaming experiences of my entire life, and I’m talking Slaughtering Grounds levels of bad.\n\nThe game play idea is very simple, as with other side scrolling action games, you progress to the right hand side of your screen taking out enemies as you go, somehow this game doesn’t manage to even do that concept very well. Let’s start off with the controls, you obviously cannot miss them because as soon as you start the game, BAM there they are in your face very obnoxiously…at the start of every level too. There is a nice feature that I have not seen in games before, where you press a button and you can move backwards rather than moving the directional stick, I thought it was quite cool, only when I found out you couldn’t actually shoot whilst moving…so it turned out to be quite a pointless addition.  Most levels you will almost always run out of ammo for your weapons. This is infuriating when you are only about half way through the stage, and you have a trail of bad guys chasing you because you aren’t able to kill them, how do you get more ammo you ask? By killing bad guys…ironic huh.\n\nThe art style in Burgers is probably its only redeeming feature. The cartoon look to it really pleased the eye and most of the animations were done really well too. The background environments are almost just a copy and paste throughout the stage as you can see the copy point quite clearly.  Next, we have the sound effects, or a better wording would be, the lack of. The only sounds you will get out of this game are the sound of your automatic rifle and the sound of bullets landing on your foes. Nothing else. Seriously, nothing. The flamethrower gun makes no sound. Enemies charging at you, make no sound. No soundtrack, I thought maybe the game had bugged so reinstalled it, nope, nothing – it is seriously bad.\n\nThe game can be easy or hard, depending on how well you are at conserving your ammo and how quick you are at picking up the controls. I couldn’t get past the last level because of the poorly designed control system and, you guessed it, lack of ammo. I have been playing for just over an hour and have no intention to ever pick this game up again.\n\nThere aren’t any actual technical problems, what is there in the game does work, it just doesn’t make sense. I ran it on 1440p without any problems at 60 fps, but of course, it’s never going to be the most taxing of games on any modern day rig.\n\nTo sum up, Burgers, is 100% definitely the worst game I have played in the past 12 months, and it quite possibly the worst game I have ever played in my entire life. I am still shocked at how bad the sound department is of this game and the poorly produced gameplay. Do not give this game any time of day, even at £1,99 this game is not worth a single penny.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The first thing I ran into was that remapping controls didn't work. I tried remapping the fire-button to the mouse, but it wouldn't accept mouse-input. So I then tried remapping it to several keys on my keyboard (C, left-shift (which it didn't accept at all), left Alt, and CapsLock), but none of them worked. I thought, ok, maybe the first level you just aren't supposed to shoot, just avoid the bad guys? Ofcourse not. Remapping just doesn't work in this game. I even hooked up my controller, but the game didn't even pick it up.\n\nAfter I got used to pressing "J" to fire ("J"? why J?) I keep running into the problem of running out of ammo. It takes 5 shots to take out an enemy, but oftentimes I run out of ammo before even getting to the halfway point of the map. And yes, I hit an enemy with every shot.\n\nThe next thing that bothers me to no end is the crappy English in the dialogues. Come on, at least let someone who knows English grammar take a look at your script. Poor grammar comes across as very unprofessional.\n\nAll in all, not pleased with this game. Glad I got it for free, at least ^_^. Just letting it run for the cards.","September 19, 2015","false","15.4"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","30","41","0","0"

This game suffers from repetition of everything. The level is just walking left to right, shooting the same enemies in the same configuration listening to the same five seconds of music over and over. The developers were very lazy on putting effort into this game. They put a guide on steam guides advising you can change character, why is this not in the game? Pure 100% lazy. If you want gun upgrades, you'll need a lot of cash, to get cash, you'll need to do the same levels over and over.

Firstly I thought it can be a good game anyways. It has a story, 9 levels and 3 challenging bosses. Very nice is the armory menu where you can unlock several different weapons and character upgrades with the in-game earned money. They are also partly XP locked - another decent detail in-game which is appreciated.\n\nBut if you finally start the story you fall into somekind of overwhelming cliche plot. Aliens, Nazis, World War are the very boring almost everywhere seen remix of stupidiness leading even into a lame final. Though each enemy looks unique, they seem pretty familiar to me and stolen from movies like "The 5th Element" or "Independence Day". The animations are poor like shrinking and expanding sprites. Most funny is just the reanimation nurse. But you don't want to remember any of this after playthrough once.\n\nAnother lack are the controls (Xbox controller supported) and their handling. P.e. you cannot run backwards and shoot simultaneously. Reload is manual and the hitboxes are unprecise. Gameplay turnsout mostly into run around and don't get hit by bullets or alien bodies. Because enemies spawn hidden behind haystacks and can suddenly rip you apart. The bullets don't have a lane, so they hit your entire body. Also annoying are street blocking tanks which you must destroy before you can proceed.\n\nSomehow there's no possibility to exit to the main menu. Primarly the game is meant to play in coop but I haven't tested it. I don't wanna to know if the hosting works fine or not. Conclusion: I suggest to buy it cheap on sale, playthrough quickly and deinstall it again. The 5 achievements are quite easy to do.","December 9, 2015","false","4.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/385830/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Burgers is a casual and very short, WW2 themed, side-scrolling twin-stick shooter made using Unity.  The only campaign can be played in singleplayer or coop mode.\n\nFor the most part the game is a let down with not enough levels of play, and those that are there are over too quickly.  The nice cartoony graphics and fast-moving gameplay make it hard to dislike.  The controls are rock-solid but the audio somewhat underwhelming.  Characters and weapons can be swapped in-game but only between playing sessions.  It seems that the developers may have been going for a free game with MT options for the weaponary and character selections but changed their minds during development.\n\nThere is a promising core of minimal features and gameplay in Burgers but at the moment it is far from being a product I could recommend.  Its lack of seriousness makes the game endearing but only worth a look if brought in a sale.  In short its a budget title that might be worth a dollar to someone.  Just because I dont recommend it, it doesnt mean you wont like it.\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: Casual, side-scrolling, twin-stick shooter\n\n02. SETTING: Alternative monster-ridden World War II theme\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: You play the role of a German soldier towards the end of the war (or other character) in an area that is about to become infested by alien looking monsters controlled by evil mind-controlling sphere.\n\n04. GAME MODES: There is only one campaign comprising of seven or so levels, which do not have to be played sequentially once unlocked.  It can be played in single-player and coop modes.\n\n05. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: Only basic gameplay makes it into this game.  Basic movement, shooting direction, weapon changes and  ammo pick-ups are about all there is.  Enemies come in a few guises and some hide behind cover, while boss battles happen across most of the campaign levels.\n\nThere is a shop that uses credits earned for completing missions to buy new or upgraded weapons and change starting characters.  There are quite a few to choose from even if you can only carry three weapons (main rifle, pistol and knife.)  You also receive a handful of grenades which are best kept for bosses or vehicles/tanks.\n\nLevelling is automatic with XP earned shown at the end of a mission, auto-upgrading character stats and unlocking the most powerful weapons.\n\nWhile there is little wrong with the design I did find it somewhat minimal and inconsistent in terms of the game's overall vision.  Seems the devs may have started out making a game with MTs and then changed their minds.  Unless of course there is an iOS/tablet version which I would not have heard of.\n\n06. ENEMIES: As you would expect from a side-scroller enemies appear from the right of the screen and are fairly static therefore only providing a challenge in numbers or with higher protection.  There is a low to fair mix of enemies; humans in the guise of armed civilians or German soldiers together with a mashing of different aliens collectively form the mass of enemies you will face.  There are some bosses to defeat but only your inability to control your character will stop you from progressing.\n\n07. LEVEL/GAME DESIGN: In keeping with expectations game design is basic.  It works as a twin-stick shooter and my general feeling was that while it is devoid of alot of detail a good core was there to build upon.\n\n08. A.I: Basic.  Unfortunately with most of the action appearing from the right of screen there are not many surprises and thus it doesnt need to be much more.\n\n09. CONTROLS: I used keyboard by default.  Optionally mouse can be used for shooting.  Overall they are solid and responsive.  Can also use controller but did not do so during my play sessions.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: Very good.  Cartoony.  Depictions of soldiers and enemies are cute if nothing else.  Backdrops are limited to two or three locations with slight varations to give that extra dimension.  Perhaps the games best graphics are the representations of the weapons taken from WW2 and beyond.  Though the sprinkling of cutscenes that explain the story are apt.  Sadly though thats it.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Not so great. The in-game sounds are fine but the soundtracks seems to be (mostly) a collection of off-the-shelf tunes and melodies.  Some seem to fit the game's ambience while others do not.  The music just doesnt add anything positive to the whole ambience.\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: None.\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Played on Normal difficulty and it was much easier than it should be.  Only the bosses provided some challenge and some vehicles move too fast to be avoided.  Luckly you dont die straight away and can muddle through.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: No problems encountered but I did not try coop so I dont know if there are problem with that.  There doesnt seem to be any major issues on looking through the steam forums.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: An achievement hunters dream.  Five very basic achievements, two can be gained very easily, just by playing.  Two more from shop purchases and the final one is gained by completeing the final level.\n\n16. DLC: None, unsurprisingly.\n\n17. ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: Did not try coop play.\n\n18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Its a very basic game and there is very little to challenge players.  That said it may only appeal to those players who like casual shooters or want a hour or two of harmless fun with their friends in coop.\n\n19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: For single-player you can expect to get just over one hours enjoyment out of it.  Maybe two at a stretch.  Coop could take a few hours more possibly to five or six with repeat play.  Only more if you grow attached to it.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: I cant see it being worth more than a dollar/pound/euro.  Others may disagree.  It depend though how many drinking sessions you find you want to play this.  I could be wrong but I cant see many players playing it past completing it the once.  Afterall there are many other coop shooters out there to enjoy with friends.","October 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The controls are a mess; firing the gun is bound to "J" for some reason and I couldn't get it to bind to the mouse.

But you'll most likely only pick three toppings and a couple of condiments, because, quite frankly, you won't give a sh-t.  You'll probably be upswinging your knife while dashing at them for half the time.  I surprisingly destroyed four armor-plated spitball tank barbecues with only my knife and my mighty swinging arm.  I headbutt too.\n\nOverall, it was a solid eating, and it satisfied a hunger I never had.  I surprisingly ate the entire burger and earned five achievements for it, somehow "100%-ing" this under-achieved burger joint.  It definitely needs more achievements, and smarter ones too, because unlocking a cheap condiment is not really an achievement.  And, seriously, when I eat a whole burger and I'm ready to move on, don't keep me waiting for you to give me some cards, okay.  I got other joints to go to.  If you had done those achievements properly, I would have stayed longer, but you didn't, so, drop the cards before I bite into the burger, okay?  It's because of this I'll never return.\n\nAnyways, its a cheap one-hit wonder burger joint that packs a decent punch.","January 30","true","6.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So basically Burgers is an action shooter indie game with simple cartoonish visuals. You play as a soldier during the war against Nazi and their mutation monsters. The story is not really anything special or completely new, it's just simple like that but it works.\n\nAction side is done very well and it is absolutely stunning! You will get to use all kinds of cool weapons and characters. All the weapons are entertaining to use and that feeling when shooting a gun, so satisfying. You will get ammo for the weapons quite often, but in case you run out of ammo, knife is also a powerful weapon, but a little slow. If the game ends up being too easy for you, you can always crank up the difficulty to your own personal preference! I recommend Burgers to those who are fan of action indie games, just like me. It's an entertaining and enjoyable experience and I had so much fun playing it.\n\nAnd one more thing I have to say, Burgers is a first release from a small team named storm_sharks, so don't judge them too hard, they really did a great job. Positive feedback is needed here, it gives motivation to the developers as well as players that are wanting to buy the game.\n\nPROs- Great concept\n- Simple, Enjoyable, Relaxing & Challenging\n- Run smoothly in new windows generation (me windows 10), I've had no performance issues myself\n- Many fun weapons to use\n\nCONs- Co-op mode can't be played online (at this time is 'Local wifi only')\n- Too simple animation\n\nConclusion:\nworth the price and worth playing.","August 14, 2015","true","8.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The integration of local co-op fits with this genre of games and lends it an additional engaging veneer that extends its replayable value. As a game on early access, it's not without its faults. However, these can be forgiven in light of the early access status and faith in the direction of the game creators.

In it's current state the game is like a horizontal as opposed to vertical scrolling version of Ikari Warriors (for those who have played that, if you have you are officially *OLD*). It's functional but a bit basic where you wind up switching between a pistol, machine gun, and grenades to kill waves of identical looking enemies while occasionally popping an explosive barrel. The game truely needs more enemy variety in this state but I can only hope that is coming.\n\nPremise-wise the game has you playing as a "German Soldier" in WW II, coveyed in the modern reinventionalist stance popular with Japan that is trying to seperate this from the Nazis. While playing a Nazi in a heroic context outside of the historical war could be thought provoking, and I think the world is ready for that, this is not the game to do it. The plot has very little to do with the war as a whole and your killing monsters for the most part. The only part of the game that some might find disturbing in this context from what I've seen is the first level where all of the bad guys have pronounced noses (a sort of Jewish stereotype) where the main character your playing has no real nose at all. Some may read into this, but it's never explicitly stated who your fighting, just people of this village where wierd stuff happens before the aliens and giant spiders show up.\n\nTo be fair if they never specified your playing as a German soldier and armed you with vintage WW II weaponry there would be nothing even remotely controversial about this. There isn't anything offensive here, as the game seems to be intentionally walking the fence, as far as I've seen the Devs are correct and there isn't even a single swatstika on display though given the fanaticism that caused WW II I'd find it hard to believe anyone trusted with a special mission as this seems to be wouldn't be a loyalist of the National Socialist party, which of course doesn't mean someone is neccesarily a genocidal maniac (it being a workers rights movement by and large which got derailed by the leadership). Even if one argues for what would be a rare exception you'd at least be dealing with an ultra-nationalist in the military. But as I said this goes well beyond the context of what I've seen in the game.\n\nWith some work "Burgers" could be good, but it lacks the charm or quality of "Castle Crashers" so far, but it could get there and become a shooter version. Shorter levels, more enemy variety, more background scenery to give it personality, etc... and this could very well turn into a great little game.","August 21, 2015","true","0.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

You start the game with 4 characters to choose from (all of them being germans) and you get another 4 (or 3) to unlock (in which are mostly americans). You get a small amount of weapons to choose from (but each has a vast amount of skins to unlock). As you progress in the game you earn money and level, the money you will use to buy the characters and weapons you've unlocked.\n\nThe game is all cartoonish, the monsters doesn't really scares you at all (nor makes you desperate trying to kill'em). It has a plot of its own, its about some sort of sphere that turns people into monsters (correct me if i'm wrong) and you also get to kill nazis as well.\n\nUnfortunately the team behind this game is very small (and new at making games), so it may take time until they are actually able to add coop (other than wifi-coop) or any significant update. But it is a fantastic game nevertheless for its price! lovely to kill-time.\n\nPros  Fun, fast-paced game\nStuff to unlock\nLeveling up\nNice to kill time\nVery accessible price!\nCons No coop with distant people (only wifi)\nStill no achievements (they are making it)","September 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Burgers is inspired by games like Castle Crashers where mindless co-op fun takes place. The idea is not original at all but I see this is coming from a new developer in the industry so consider that when providing useful feedback or even when playing the game.\n\nThe story is about a group of soldiers who were deployed for a mission that turned out to be more dangerous than expected and not with the enemies they had in mind. In order to save the world (cliché, I know) they have to ignore their main mission for a greater cause. At your disposal, you have several sorts of weapons that you can buy with some funny names with different designs as well. As you advance in the game you will level up and acquire money for said weapons which will become very useful in later levels. Speaking of the levels, there aren’t many of them and I guess that the small price reflects on the small content the game has to offer. Still, it can be a quick side distraction for those dead hours or if you just want a quick gaming session without having to worry about complex tutorials or something similar.\n\nAt this point there is no local co-op which can be a deal breaker for some, however I believe that this a feature that will planned for their next game. Still, it was a big missed opportunity. In the end, I believe this game can be worth your time, just don’t expect a quality story driven game or even a original concept, otherwise you will be disappointed.\n","December 10, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So I then tried remapping it to several keys on my keyboard (C, left-shift (which it didn't accept at all), left Alt, and CapsLock), but none of them worked. I thought, ok, maybe the first level you just aren't supposed to shoot, just avoid the bad guys? Ofcourse not. Remapping just doesn't work in this game.

You will have the option to level up your  current german hero, and its weapons. You have alot to choose between, which is either machineguns, pistols, mele weapons and character before you will face and stop monsters and the germans evil plans. The whole game will be based either as storylined or arena, to fight the monsters. In the storyline you have a option to re-play missions and finish the 2.5 hour storyline content on normal, if not hard is the one you search.\n\nIf you search a short story indie rpg game, then this is worth a short.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3FF75PLYvI","August 22, 2015","true","2.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","9","17","3","1"

An interesting little game with multiple levels of increasing difficulty. I'm not entirely sure why it's called Burgers, The story is interesting, apparently an alien invasion is happening in a small town and you are sent in to deal with it. You can Level up, unlock characters, and purchase weapons. It's not a bad game, a little retro though. Some have compared it to plants vs zombies, but I don't really see the comparison.

It's actually short.\nYou can just skip the levels by running thorugh the enemies, or kill them all for the XP.\nThis game have a good system of purchasing upgrades and getting better weapons.\nBad thing is that this game have very poor quality. For the price it costs, it's worth.\nBurgers is a simple game with the style of Plants vs Zombies.\nIt's a pretty short game (as you can see I beat the whole thing in 4hours) but it's quite fun and enjoyable.\nGameplay is boring. Soundtrack from level1 is same like soundtrack from the game One Epic Knight. I am actually wondering why this game have "Burgers" in the name, when there is no Burgers at all?\nMonsters are really cool and original. OK weapons, OK characters, OK story, and OK Art.\nIn the game you have primary and secondary weapon + knife.\nSometimes you also get acces to electric of flame gun.\nThere is also posiblility to unlocks few better versions of guns, but it dont change more.\nI would say for what this is, it was a good execution!\nMy rating for this game is 5/10, and you should keep your money for better games, and don't waste them for this game.\nAnyways, I - recommend this game for the action/indie/platformer game fans !\n####PRO's#### : 1.It have a lot of Steam Trading Cards !\nCard 1[prntscr.com]\nCard 2[prntscr.com]\nCard 3[prntscr.com]\nCard 4[prntscr.com]\nEvery Card\n2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/recommended/385830/","PhyreMatrix","PhyreMatrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/","941 products in account","This game reminds me a bit of Zombieville USA. Only it's not a mobile game and it's on Steam. I played about half an hour of it and it didn't appeal to me. For the first four levels you shoot things that follow you. Actually the first level was unique in that the AI had guns and shot back. After that initial stage it turned into some German alien war game which in theory sounds like it could be interesting.\n\nI mean those people like those Nazi zombie games right? But the execution leaves a lot to be desired. To economically handle mobs of aliens just shoot a barrel once and walk with it in front of you. When you see a mob approaching take a few steps back and shoot the barrel for a free explosion. Mob problem solved. There are multiple weapons but they end up being more for visual effect rather than effectively or creatively taking down alien hordes.\n\nThe only good thing about this game are the controls. They're simple and straight forward. But even for the multiplayer aspect I have to say there are a number of other games to choose. Nothing in particular sets this game apart from the rest. Not even it's predictable lackluster story.","September 13, 2015","false","10.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The ammo went toward knife ammo (and no other weapon). From that point onward I was able to reload my knife (only once, as swinging did not consume ammo).

The achievements are easy to 100% and that's the only thing that matters in these "indie gems" anyway.
