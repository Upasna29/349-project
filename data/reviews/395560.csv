The money spent in developing the game was too little or the staff was too tired. Graphics are just passable. Story is sufferable. and Bugs are plenty. Its is not as humorous as the first. Considering the price and the competition, or lack of, its OK.","October 9, 2015","false","20.6"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","49","59","6","4"

Get it ONLY during a sale IF you really must get it at all. I do like  the first lost horizon in many ways but this just isnt the same. some of the puzzles are SO ilogical that no wonder thay put in a walkthrough in - game ,for instance (not trying to add spoilers so I wont give out too much information) you are in the forest looking for a back entrance you KNOW you are in the right spot no doubt at all but NOTHING happens ZILCH no indication to point you in the right direction either . I only found out what to do by looking at the walkthrough there are too many instances like this that I just got annoyed with the game .some good graphics however commenting on the sounds now in ALL the scenes where theres water falling from the rocks above you dont hear ANY water!! not a trickle! like I said  good graphics but dont expect good puzzles because you will end up looking at the walkthrough some of the time. Good story some good voice acting too. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would say a 6 maybe 6 and a half.\nthe pc system requirements say this needs at LEAST a 2 gb memory for the GRAPHICS CARD but I have a 1 gb graphics card a gtx 550 ti and I have no graphical problem at all. Im only playing this game for the story and the cool locations with mystic ruins etc NOT for anything else and certainly NOT for the stupid illogical puzzles. This game wasn't ready too be released when it did it needed more testers.","December 3, 2015","false","12.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The graphics were beautiful. The story was captivating. Exploring old houses is especially fun for me. I experienced no technical issues throughout gameplay. In the style of point and click adventures, there was a lot of thinking to be done in this game.Most of the puzzles were easy. I would say the one at the end with the Nordic Boat was particularly difficult. I really enjoyed that the characters travelled all over the world. Some of the landscapes were very beautiful. I really enjoyed the fact that autumn leaves fell throughout certain segments of the game. It reminded me of another of my most favourite games,Black Mirror III. The learning curve seemed to fall on easy for most of the game until you reached the final chapters. It then seemed to soar up to rather difficult in certain areas. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys point and click adventures with a pseudo-historical narrative.  Since Germany isn't allowed to utilise the swastika in games they chose a different symbol. This didn't take away from the overall story regarding World War II. It helped you understand the severe terror these people went through especially in their hiding from the Nazi's. In a way it reminded me of when I visited Anne Frank's house in The Netherlands.","October 20, 2015","true","16.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"

Graphics are very nice, ambient sound and voice actors are great. Puzzles are logical and good, sometimes are time based puzzles anoying, you must repeat whole scenario again and again. The lenght of the game is acceptable, about 10 hours. Story is great, you playing with 3 difrent players, sometimes you must switch between two players for finish some task, and this is great implemented into the story. You visit many diffrent locations and they are very colorful. The story is presented with many great animations. I played the first Lost Horizon game and I like it and  I must say that the second one is better.","March 28","true","8.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I liked the predecessor and I really enjoyed this one so far. The story is good, the graphics are nice and the tasks are motivating. The locations are nice, varied and captivating. There are some glitches now and then with the animations, but they are not disturbing. I do not like the reaction-parts of the gameplay, fortunately there are not many in the first four chapters. I play the game with mouse only, just as classic adventure games are meant to be played and it works perfectly.","November 3, 2015","true","10.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I don't understand why people don't like this game. It is very pleasant, the graphics are perfectly acceptable and the puzzles are fair and well integrated into the story. As a conventional point&click adventure game, it does not break any moulds, but I don't see why it has to either. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but why can't people just enjoy some good old fashioned adventure game like they used to.","February 4","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics are serviceable, however the gameplay is sorely lacking. Decently voice acted, but utterly devoid of any other mechanics that would make this game in any way worthwhile.\n\nA simple point and click game with subpar "casual" gaming mechanics coupled with inadequate and poorly designed options menus and barebones tutorials... with VERY badly configured keyboard controls (rebinding helps but not enough) make this $40 title a veritable ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of your wallet. AVOID THIS GAME!\n\nYou can see my first impressions review of the game here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7VqeuFML40","October 2, 2015","false","1.2"," 60 of 127 people (47%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","47","60","127","11","5"
