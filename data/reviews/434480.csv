"http://steamcommunity.com/id/octupus8/recommended/434480/","octupus8","Dr. Phil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/octupus8/","398 products in account","I'll play Devil's Advocate since it seems like only one other reviewer actually bothered to play this game all the way through.\n\nMathoria: It All Adds Up is a RPG-Maker game inspired by Pokemon with a combat system where the player must answer simple math questions in order to defeat opponents/obtain items.\n\nThe math aspect isn't particularly interesting (though it probably helps that my mental math skills are terrible), but anyone who rates this game negatively on the basis of 'it's teaching me math and too simple for me' likely isn't the intended demographic. This game is for parents who want to spend time together while teaching their kids. In that respect, this game does well. After playing through it, I'd say that if I had a kid I probably would do just that.\n\nThat being said, a few aspects of it didn't quite feel right for a children's game. The plot was much too deep for a children's story, especially the ending. Not only this, but I feel like a child 10 or under would have trouble with some of the words in the game as well (such as Vegabond). The story didn't even need to be as intricate as it was - most children beneath the age of 10 are usually willing to forego most plots in exchange for gameplay, so having a compelling story isn't too big a requirement.\n\nThere were also a few moments, such as someone saying '♥♥♥♥♥♥ off', that didn't sit well with me for a children's game. The rest of the game is good, innocent fun and there were actually a few sections I found myself genuinely enjoying, such as the minotaur puzzles and some of the villager interactions.\n\nThe controls are definitely clunky to begin with but you get used to them in time. As another reviewer mentioned, having to press Enter to enable the answer prompt and removing the question from the screen, as well as having a timer on the question itself (which the game claims makes you answer when it runs out, but in reality fails you if you don't), feels like a bad design choice. Especially when learning math on an easy difficulty, timing the player feels too difficult and forcing them to remember the question can easily be too complicated.\n\nThe game also focuses solely on addition and not any of the other modifiers like subtraction, division or multiplication, even on higher difficulties. I suppose it makes sense for younger children, but adding this as higher-level option would extend your demographic in a fitting enough way.\n\nThe delay between the answer box popping up and when you can type feels too short as well, causing me to mistype whenever I typed too fast, but somehow I don't see that being a problem for children who may type more slowly.\n\nAn options screen would be nice, however I find I didn't have much of a problem playing at a fixed resolution, and something tells me a child wouldn't mind it all that much either and possibly wouldn't even notice.\n\nVisually the game uses a lot of RPG maker assets, which is fine since I feel like most children won't mind much unless they've played an RPG Maker game before. What looked like custom assets, however, stuck out like a sore thumb, such as a certain type of house and the ship at the end. Music felt very RPG maker-y and I hardly noticed it (which is a good thing) except for the credits/title music that felt far too hard rock.\n\nAs a game designer myself, here's my two cents: Dumb it down more. Even if you're targeting it towards parents and children, parents won't mind playing a more child-like game if their child is playing it with them. Your Pokemon references were enough to appeal to the older side of me, but most kids would be left behind by much of the game's design. This applies to controls as well - I know kids aren't stupid when it comes to controls, but an unintuitive interface could interfere with a child's enjoyment who might get bored easier than an adult. It's doubly bad if gamers are complaining about it!\n\nAll that being said, this is a student project targeted to children, so coming out of it those are my only notes. I got much more into it than I expected to, it just needs some tweaking to actually feel like a final product. At this stage I'd liken it to a prototype - one that's just about solid enough to play with a child.","March 31","true","0.9"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","50","52","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/434480/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","It's a good time for maths: games about them keep appearing on Steam. After Pythagoria and Zeus vs Monsters (links lead to my reviews), here's Mathoria: It All Adds Up, developed by a student team, with a teacher as supervisor, who happened to be also a little publisher in Philippines.\n\nMathoria: It Alls Adds Up is telling the story of a young teen, happening to be The Chosen One, whose mom is abducted by goons. It's up to him to save her, by visiting the island, by defeating obstacles and by helping others. His skills maths will be useful, especially his addition knowledge.\n\nThe game is simple: you lead a character thanks to the arrows or ZQSD/WASD (forget the mouse), you speak to other persones who will ask you to answer a problem, like "My brother ate 20 apples yesterday, I ate 35 today, how many apples in total have we eaten?". The answer field consists in 4 cases for each number (the first one is for the thousand, the second one for the hundred, the third for the dizain, the last one for an unity - for the answer of the problem above, it should look like 0055).\n\nYou have also some fights to handle: you have the choice between a simple attack (with adapted calculs, generally, the easiest you can find during a battle) and powers (with calculs that are more complicated to answer like 465+354). The equation is shown on your screen, you have a timer (ranging from 5 seconds to 30 depending of the difficulty). Hit "Enter" so that the answer field is appearing, write the answer and hit "Enter" again. If your answer is right, the damage will be inflicted to your enemy, if it's not, it's you that will loose health.\n\nLike in a RPG, you can use potions to double the damage, speed up the process of using again your powers or heal yourself. However, it's not the only items in the game: you can also put a set of clothes that can improve or decrease your HP or your damage. It means that you have to be careful for answers as a set can inflict 60 damages but leave you with 10 HP only. A single wrong answer and you're dead - though in the game, dying isn't accepted: goons are putting themselves on the side when defeated, much still alive.\n\nYou have three difficulties: I've played the Easy one, as I didn't want to be confronted to harder calculs, even if in the end, I was because of the powers.\n\nThere are several problems that can be improved if there is any sequel.\n\nFor me, the most important is probably the one that will never be taken in account: the game is in English, which means that any non-English speaker kid can't answer the problems unless an adult can translate. However, as the game is only about addition, you know that you need to add this number to this other one. But still, for sequels, if there is a mix of calculs with substraction or multiplication or division, there will be a problem.\n\nThe second one is related to the fact that I've explained the controls above: you don't have really any tutorial in real time: you have to read what is explained (again in English), if you don't miss the characters that will tell it (for the fight, it's included naturally, not for the problems). You're speaking to kids, it's way more useful to show them in real time than rely on the fact that they've understood the mechanics just like that.\n\nThe third problem is that it's short. In more or less 1h30, I was already at the end. Not that I don't complain, because for kids, it's not too short. However, it would have been much better to have a little more of exploring. However, given the end, it seems clear that the idea of a sequel was in their heads and that substraction could be the next focus.\n\nThe fourth problem is the difficulty: an easy difficulty for me means calculs like 1+9, 10+10 but not 345+114. For any young kid that can't handle these, they can't use the powers and are just stuck to use simple attacks, which means that some of the enemies will take long to defeat. The developers should revise the difficulty at least to stick more to it.\n\nI don't mind the fact that the game was made with RPG Maker - a blog post explains the beginning of the conception where Unity wasn't easy to handle for Mathoria. But it's not a bad move as the game can still attract children.\n\nMathoria isn't as bad as the reviews seemed to say. Many of the players missed the full point of the game, which is drilling in mental calcul and only saw the fact that they didn't get a RPG. Anyway, while Mathoria isn't perhaps the best educationnal game out there, it's still a nice try. It's free, so, your wallet will not be hurt by this one. It's worth a try.","April 5","true","1.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","1"

It didn't feel like a game, it felt like a math quiz, down to getting a single point for each correct answer. There was no element of strategy, tactics, or luck.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudeofdeath/recommended/434480/","dudeofdeath","dudeofdeath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudeofdeath/","101 products in account","This game is a RPG math game for children. It's like Pokemon, but to fight and win you have to solve the (very simple) equations. Unfortunately the game wouldn't recognize my keyboard inputs like my name, so I became known as:    . It also made it impossible for me to win any fights ever, because I couldn't enter the answers to equations which is the way you win fights. So basically that was game over for me... So I can't really comment on the story.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is basically in the equations, and for the three difficulty modes it's something like this: Easy: 3+0. Normal: 3 +10. Hard 18 + 15.\n\nThis difficulty level makes the target audience quite narrow. There is a lot of english text to browse through, so it essentially rules out english speaking kids below 7½/8 years of age because they would simply not be able to read through all the text essential to understand and play the game. The equations themselves however are so easy that 'easy' difficulty can be quite easily be solved by kids 5-6 years of age; medium is about 6/7-8 years, and hard 7/8-9 years. So basically the target group is between 7½ to 9 years, add to that kids above 9 years with special math difficulties, or kids aged 7½ year and down with super english reading skills.\n\nFor these reasons alone I find it hard to recommend the game. Perhaps if the story is interesting, but unfortunately because the inputs bugged out I will never know.","March 31","false","0.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","11","20","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/recommended/434480/","badhairqueen","badhairqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/","55 products in account","OverviewA nice enough little game with decent playtime (~2+ hours for me), made in RPG Maker. You play a boy whose mother has been kidnapped, so you go on a quest to save her. Your travels take you through the entire island of Additio (or something like that), which is divided into several townships, each ruled by a village elder whom you can seek guidance from. Fight enemies, gather items, build up on your skills, and glean better armour along the way. All battles require answering addition problems. There are also various optional side quests which require you to search for stuff or solve villagers' maths questions.\n\nThe Good    There's a story - You learn a little bit more about your character and enemies as you go along, and things build up. So, yes, there's a sense of heightening drama.\nGood variation in gameplay - It's not all maths problem-solving; often you need to explore areas, speak to characters and interact with stuff in order to accomplish side quests or discover bonus areas/items.\nA lot to explore - The game world is actually quite extensive, with several "hidden" or optional areas to check out.\nNice graphics - Very pastoral, village-y in nature. I liked the sense of immersion, which could be further heightened had the game been made playable in full screen as well.\nSome interesting ideas - It's not just walking all the time; you get to jump too! And I liked the final boss' hideout.\nNot that linear - The main story progresses linearly, but you can backtrack and play side quests you skipped anytime.\nCould be a useful educational tool - ...If they fixed "The Bad" I listed below.\nAdults could find this fun as well - I found it a good test of my mental arithmetic and how fast I could answer, and I certainly enjoyed the adventure-gaming component.\nThe Bad    The story ends abruptly - It's unfinished. No indication whatsoever if there's going to be a sequel or whatever.\nNo fullscreen mode - The actual game screen is tiny, which killed the experience a lot, especially since the whole point of RPG games is to immerse you in your surroundings and make you feel part of the game world. Luckily, the text is still of a decent size and is readable.\nMusic is tiring - I think the game alternates between 2 main audio tracks every other screen. One of the tracks is quite aurally draining and I had to turn it down.\nThe input method is buggy - When you key in your answer slightly faster, the numbers get jumbled up or repeated, resulting in a wrong answer! E.g. "54" becomes "45", or "544". This happened to me at least 5 times, so I had to type in the numbers slower.\nThe way the game tests your maths-solving skills is downright dumb - Here's what happens when you're posed with a question during battle: e.g. 32 + 34. A timer appears as soon as the question shows, and you must press "enter" to answer. When you press "enter", the timer goes away, and now you have all the time in the world to input your answer. This is a huge flaw in game design. So basically you're not tested on how fast you can work out the solution (since as I mentioned, you have as much time as you like to key in your answer), but how fast you can memorise the question! Considering the entire game was developed with this kind of illogical mechanic in place is insanely laughable. (I suppose that's why it's free?!)\nPuzzles only involve addition - I don't know if there will be sequels, but this game just involved addition, as the characters were confined to the island of "Additio". I'd be keen to check out what comes next, since the story is unfinished.\nThe English is pretty terrible - On some maths problems, you have to guess at what they mean, because the phrasing is ambiguous or linguistically incorrect. A serious edit is required.\nSummaryA cute, visually pleasant, relatively fun game that involves a fair bit of exploration and tests your addition skills. At its current price of $0, you should give it a try.","April 8","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Oh boy... Well, lets get this over with...\n\nThis game is created, on what seems to be RPG maker. For an RPG maker, its very modified, polished, and quite addicting. Most of the negative reviews are based on lack of settings, and resolution. Its true, it has no settings. But with just a little more effort and knowledge, you dont need it.\nALTERNATIVES: ALT-ENTER (Reisize Screen), And use your Audio Mixer to change the volume.\n(Yea its a little more work, but totally worth it.)\n\nThe game its self, is amazing. (For a free to play RPG based on math)\n\nWell im not the brightest person, nor am I good at RPG's, so naturally I chose Easy.\n\nThe game has a surprisingly great story line. (Wont spoil it) But basically to sum it up with one Cliche. *YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE!!!!!*  (Shocking, I know)\n\nYou earn skills by doing side missions, and helping people out.\n\nThe battle system requires basic knowledge of Addition. Obviosly, the harder the difficulty, the more you wish you took a higher level in math at school. (Loosing makes u feel like and idiot. Very Punishing.)\n\nThe battles are quite fun, and actually not repetitive because of the math implimantation.\n\nAnother cool upside, is changing your armor actually changes your characters appearance! :D (2cool4school)\n\nThere are minigame worlds *kinda*, and a variety of enemy models. (Monsters, Humans, etc)\n\nOne problem I have had, is it seems the *Helping civilians do math* system seems broken. *Unless im really stupid and cant do 40+50... if so, kill me plz*\n\nThe soundtrack also is pretty nice. Its no Undertale, and idk if its original... but its nice.\n\nOver all, I would have to rate this game an 8/10 -IGN\n\nIts fun, not repetitive, possibly a little broken in some way, but I have experience with RPG maker, and its pretty hard to modify it as much as they have.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ZMcMszzMObtMBoeVXINzA?spfreload=10\n\nThanks, and GAME ON!\n\n\n\n","April 5","true","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marcinthelotus/recommended/434480/","Marcinthelotus","marcinthelotus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marcinthelotus/","30 products in account","I tried this game because I am looking for some games to play with my little cousin who needs help with maths. It doesn't really cut it.\n\nGood:\nCute/pretty as far as RPG maker games go.\nAbility to sprint which is always nice.\nA lot of drills and problems and varying difficulties for kids learning arithmetic.\nCute simple story with a simple path to follow.\nFREE - and good length of gameplay for a free game, I spent a bit over an hour playing it through.\n\nBad:\nVery unforgiving. The questions from the villagers only give you one try and even though you can take all the time you need the longer problems, which are more difficult, disappear once you get to the second screen so you have to rely on memory for what the problem is. The combat problems are timed and then disappear but are easier. You are not given the answer if you get it wrong.\n\nIf you forget to lift the sprint key when you talk to someone it works like the enter or space key and causes you to do whatever action or miss part of the conversation.\n\nThe combat system isn't intuitive. You have to hit enter before you can put in your answer. The easy difficulty has a tutorial that explains this but the normal and difficut difficulties don't. Even so, it's not a very good set up and the problems having a short timer and disappearing when you go to answer aren't good for kids with dyscaluclia or dyslexia, which my cousin has. Those tend to be common problems for kids who need help with maths.\n\nThe menu is awful. I don't know much else to say there. It's just... weird? And even in the tutorial I didn't see anyone tell me how to access it (by hitting 0). I fell upon it by accident, which I'm glad I did because it's also the back button. It's only called "the pause menu".\n\nIt was boring. I received quite a few of the same problems. The problems had all the same setup; either ? + ? or "I had __ amount and then got __ amount. How much do I have total?" There were a couple word problems with three numbers you had to sum. (It's ONLY addition. But thats in the game description so it's expected but a bit odd to not have any other arithmetic)\n\nQuite a bit of memory testing without reminders which isn't all that great. It seems a bit more heavy on memory than maths. The one mistake I made was from a more complex word problem that I couldn't re-read the problem and forgot the figures I had to add.\n\nThe English was pretty bad. Some things had really bad grammar or didn't make much sense. Usually I don't care as long as I know what it meant but I don't know how good that would be for a kid still learning English grammar. There were also some words that were really beyond the level of the target age group.\n\n"Side quests" are actually required to advance. That's a bit weird.\n\nOverall, its like a good start to a game but I wouldn't really recommend it to older players because of the simplicity and tediousness unless you want to practice some addition for some simple brain exercises. For my little cousin I can just see her getting frustrated at how unforgiving the word problems are and the combat set up.","April 26","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is too easy for me, but it main focus is to educating the child, the difficultive level is okay.\n\nPoint that made it a good child education game:\nEasy math question\nDirect flow of gameplay, the child won't get lost in game with such as direct quest.\nSome silly question given by the NPC\nWhat I like about this game:\nThe silly question of NPC (some of them really silly)\nChoice to choose if the player want to have high damage equipment or high hp equipment. (Of course I choose the one with high damage but low hp, I'm confident with my math skill)\nThe cat as  entrance to minotour map	.\nSome of the hard side question given by the producers NPC (This one is more challenging)\nmysterious potion	 that obtain form the producers NPC and the effect of that items. ( high damage and the effect of ignoring wrong answer, yes even you didn't answer it correctlly, the player will still hit the enemy	).\nLooking forward for the sequel.
