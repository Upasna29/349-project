Claim your waifu and show her your Vanguard Cannon.\n\nThe Steam release is CENSORED but you can easily install the official restoration patch from the Sunrider website to view the girls in all their naked glory the way God intended.  Now with the most important part out of the way, on to the other stuff.\n\nMade by the same developer that made the excellent Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, Sunrider Academy takes those memorable characters and transplants them into a standard Japanese style school setting as a dating sim/time management/visual novel game.  You play as Kayto Shields, Vice-President of the student council, and are tasked with making sure the three "trouble school clubs" are whipped into shape.  At the same time, you must also manage your duties as a school student and keep up with homework, exams, and finding a girlfriend before the end of the year otherwise it's BAD END!\n\nFirst of all, you DO NOT need to play Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius first but I highly recommend you do because one, it's an excellent game, two, it will provide some nice background to the characters and setting, and three, it's FREEEEE.  The cast of characters of Sunrider Academy carry the same personalities from the other games from the Sunrider franchise so if you're a fan, you can expect Asaga to be as bubbly as ever and Ava to have the same stern demeanor.  Not every character returns however as the devs made it perfectly clear they didn't have the budget for more than 4 main heroines so this is sad news for fans of Claude, Icari, or Kryska.  Fortunately, I did encounter brand new characters which I can already tell will be an integral part of the story.\n\nThe gameplay should be familiar to veterans of dating sims or visual novels.  You'll be reading a lot of text and making the occasional decision to branch out the story as per standard with these types of games.  The bulk of the gameplay however, is in time management.  Kayto has different stats and each one has an effect on the choices you make in-game.  For example, having high intelligence will increase your exam scores while having high athleticism will reduce your chances of getting sick.  You'll be raising your stats by participating in activities like studying or exercising and these can succeed or fail based on luck and game difficulty.  Fortunately, if you don't like the RNG aspect of success/failure then you can lower the game's difficulty all the way down to "waifu-mode" to make it impossible to fail.\n\nAs mentioned before, you are charged with propping up the three worst performing clubs (kendo, science, swimming) otherwise the club will be disbanded and it's BAD END.  You can spend your time recruiting more members, overseeing team practice, or raising morale.  Each will have an effect on their performance during competitions which is important for winning prestige.  If you can manage to get your clubs up to speed and get lots of first place finishes then you'll win a ton of prestige which is important as this minimum requirement goes up every month.\n\nIn addition to maintaining the clubs, you also have your own responsibilities as a student.  You are assigned homework every week and there are exams every month.  You must score above 60% each month otherwise you'll get a BAD END.  And of course, the whole point of the game is to secure a girlfriend before the year is over.  Flirt, buy gifts, and make the correct decisions to woo the maiden of your choice.  It's all a delicate balancing act as you must juggle your time between raising your stats, managing the clubs, and dating the girls.\n\nThe art is similar in style to the previous Sunrider games but vastly improved.  I personally like it very much and the school uniforms actually make sense this time.  It was weird seeing military officers wear school uniforms in Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius but now that they're in an actual school it doesn't look out of place.\n\nThe music is as great as ever.  The backing tracks fit the game nicely and when drama hits, you'll know right away because the music changes and really shifts the mood.\n\nIf you're still not sure whether or not to spend the money on this game, then check out the free demo first.  Also, do yourself a favor and play the excellent Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius while you're at it!\n\nRELEASE UPDATE\nI have completed all 4 arcs and, essentially, the entire game.  So here are my final thoughts.\n\nSola: Very interesting and original story but uninspired ending.  Her ending is actually pretty happy but the way it was resolved just reeks of deus ex machina.  Poor Sola... at least she still kicks @$$ in the main Sunrider series.\n\nChigara: My favorite girl from Sunrider comes with a great story and a great ending.  Her arc has a nice blend of charm and sci-fi and is resolved quite well.  You will get cavities because of how sweet her ending scene is.\n\nAsaga: "The Wild One" has a fun if fairly unoriginal story.  At least it is resolved well and Asaga is by far the funniest girl to pursue.  I genuinely laughed out a loud a bunch of times playing through her delightful arc.\n\nAva: Wow, I expected her arc to be intense based on her personality and it doesn't disappoint.  Definitely the most rewarding ending as the game makes you feel like you work your butt off to achieve it and it shows.  Chigara may still be my number one but after playing through Ava's arc, I may have to reevaluate.\n\nEach arc takes about 3-5 hours to complete.  There is no vast overarching story where you have to complete all the arcs before getting a "real ending".  Each arc stands on its own as its own individual story.\n\nEach girl, except for Ava, has 4 h-scenes.  Ava only gets 3.  Boo!\n\nI have two major gripes with the game.\n\nFirst is the writer's overzealous use of romanji.  I understand this game caters to fans of anime and Japanese culture but every time I see "mou" instead of "geez" or "pan" instead of "bread" I roll my eyes.  There is no need for this type of unnecessary pandering in a game that is 90% text.\n\nSecond is the dull gameplay. The game is half visual novel/half time management.  The visual novel part is excellent.  The time management... not so much.  It's like eating a wonderful steak but being force fed undercooked mashed potatoes in between each bite.\n\nStill, I greatly enjoyed my time with Sunrider Academy.  Thirty bucks is a bit steep but I feel like my money was well spent.  Should you buy it?  I would say yes IF you can stomach the monotonous gameplay to get to the juicy story bits.  Try before you buy!","January 13, 2015","true","62.8"," 322 of 360 people (89%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","89","322","360","73","3"

A lot of funny dialogues, sometimes they linked to the original Sunrider game. There are times when you feel a little sad, and there are also times when you want to facepalm yourself because of the characters behaviour.\n\nThere are no voice for the characters. I know there are visual novel games that have voices for their characters, and they are cheaper.\n\nIt feels kinda boring if you look it from the stat management sim. It's always the same routines. Unless there are story dialogue, but it's not that much compared to the time when we need to manage our stats.\n\nAs we know, steam does not allow sexual content, so the devs make an official content restoration patch to restore the deleted part of the steam version of the game. In my opinion, even without the patch, this game is already unappropriate to be played by kids. So don't hesitate to patch it if you buy the game. You can find the link to the patch in the discussion page.\n\nIf you only interested on the story, there are some tricks to make this game easier. I know it's cheating, but if that makes you able to enjoy the game you bought then I think it's not a problem. Check the community guide for more information.\nOverall, I enjoy playing this game, regardless of the negative sides this game gives us. I know the price is quite high, but if you really want this game, don't hesitate to buy it. If you patience enough, you can wait until the price drops. Might need some times, though.","April 16, 2015","true","93.8"," 120 of 133 people (90%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","90","120","133","22","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffdiamondartist/recommended/340730/","jeffdiamondartist","jeffdiamondartist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffdiamondartist/","10 products in account","First and foremost do not let the simple presentation fool you, Sunrider Academy is a wonderful combination of VN, dating sim, and resource management; but it's the excellent writing that makes this game shine.  Both the artwork and music are neatly designed and fit the mood of the game well. Fan service is mild, with romance and WTF moments being the main theme (not graphic sex).\n\nEach of the four girls you can date (and ultimately marry) have totally unique back stories that are a combination of: sweet, romantic, funny, and at times even dark and serious. Likewise each girl's personality is unique, making each relationship route wonderful in its own way. Even the good endings are totally different in overall personality. Dialogue is text only, but again it is VERY well written; even better than many big budget console games.\n\nAdvice: save Asaga for last because while each good ending is a happy one, hers is (in my opinion) the most romantic/cheerful ending.\n\nNote: there are many funny inside jokes and easter eggs relating to Sunrider Mask of Arcadius.\n\nDecision making is simple and occasionally funny, and will to some degree affect the girls' opinion of you. And it ~is~ possible to have more than one path oppen up to you--although you must ultimately choose one.\n\nDesign wonk: "Stress" attribute accumulates way too fast. Player solution: turn difficulty to Casual or VN mode, otherwise Kayto will be working part-time jobs just to pay for eroges. However, purchased buffs eventually solve this problem.\n\nGrade: Solid B+/A-\nI felt a range of emotions while playing Sunrider Academy: occasionally laughing and responding out loud (along with Kayto) to some of the situations/conversations. This is one that you will feel a little sad that it has to end. Very good game.","September 30, 2015","true","44.3"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","98","105","8","1"

Also continued props for providing decensoring patches.\nNow I don't wanna be a negative ninny but I do feel like I gotta point out some of the negatives aspects of Academy...\n\nThe gameplay feels... unsatisfactory for a dating sim. Part of a dating sim's fun is raising those stats to reach certain requirements, to reach those "99 str required to win the tournament and conquer her athlete heart" goals. Academy's stat building however, is purely based on randomness... even to the point that you randomly lose stats during your many moments of sleep. Just spend your hard earned credits on raising your luck by 4 points? You can get unlucky and lose 7 points of luck right after, just by sleeping. Wanna help Sola win the swimming tournament? Well, you better pray for some good RNG because it sure as hell isn't going to be coming from your good decision making and planning.\n\nOn top of that, the feedback you get from your stats is nonexistent. What does 30 fitness mean? Is that a lot? On what scale do I compare this with? What does the fitness stat even do? I don't seem to be needing it for anything in particular, aside from a vague tutorial message, telling me that it somehow correlates with stress levels. But stress suffers from the exact same lack of feedback. What is too much stress? 20? 30? 50? There doesn't seem to be a visible cap or any kind of information how bad my stress levels are. Just a number.\n\nFurthermore, the chances of meeting a person, so you can talk to them, is again, based purely on randomness. And I really feel like the game dropped the ball on the meetings outside of the scripted events. The scripted events never fail to amuse, but the random chance meetings just have you click a conversation topic button, and the girl will respond negative or positive with a few generic sentences. You don't get to know anything new about them or get any new interesting dialogue. Not to mention that the girls are each supposedly interested in certain topics and less so in other ones. But outside a few obvious ones (Sola liking to talk about religion since she works at a shrine, and Ava liking politics because you learn about this in a scripted event) the game doesn't really provide you with information about what's suppose to be a good conversation topic or not. So all that is left to you is to trial&error (and if need be, save scum, because it's the only way to get even with the RNG) your way through.\n\n28 euro (or your regional equivalent) feels a bit too steep of a price for the rather shallow rng based gameplay that Academy provides.","April 16, 2015","true","9.4"," 95 of 108 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","95","108","5","0"

It is simply because it is way too stretched out and too long. Hah! Get it? Nvm... anyways.\n\nI'll keep it simple and to the point. This game is a great visual novel, and the concept of it is great. This game expects you to make 4 playthroughs with all 4 girls and that's all fine and dandy. However, after about few hours into the game after talking a lot, events happening, and lots of things to do, you find yourself clickig the exact same things for long period of time without anything actually happening.\n\nThat's my whole problem. The game dies off after first few hours, and since you want to make at least one playthrough, you go long periods of drought without any events happening with the girls except your occasional club tournaments which become very repetative. But what is more repetative is you doing the same exact things every single day. Study, lunch, go for a walk, museum, arcade etc. At first it's a lot to do, but after a while it becomes so repetative that you want to rip your hair out.\n\nThis game could have been so much more amazing if it wouldn't be so stretched out with so much drought, or at least it was filled with so much things going on like the first few hours. If that couldn't be done, shortening it would do it much good. I also think that taking a route where you only have to do a playthrough with one girl is kinda boring. That's just my take.\n\nAnyways, thanks for taking the time to read. If you want a great visual knowel this is it, and the pictures... well... you'll be satisfied.

Mask of Arcadius is a visual novel space opera game with tactical turn-based hex strategy elements. Sunrider Academy, on the other hand, is a visual novel school dating game with stat management elements. The protagonist and character you play, Kayto Shields, is the same in both games, though he's a captain in Arcadius and a high school student in Academy. Playing Arcadius first might be a good idea, as there are MANY references to Arcadius in Academy. However, I personally played through one route of Academy before playing Arcadius, and found that it isn't *that* necessary to play it first. It certainly didn't affect my enjoyment of Academy.\n\nNow, as for my personal experience. When I picked up this game, I had just finished playing Eden* (which I would definitely recommend for those in favor of emotionally touching stories). However, whereas playing Eden* pretty much involves pressing the Enter/mouse button until the game finally ends, Sunrider is probably one of the more, if not most, complicated visual novel games I have ever played.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, the game starts with you as the Vice President of the Student Council, and you are entrusted by the President with the responsibility of helping three troubled clubs over the course of a year. Throughout the game, you are responsible for raising their membership, competition readiness, and morale, each of which plays a role in how well each club does at various competitions, which happen roughly once a month. Placing bronze, silver, or gold at these competitions earns prestige points, and you need a certain number of prestige points in order to avoid a bad end.\n\nWhile managing those clubs, you have to keep track of your own needs as well. Kayto, the main character, has several main stats to juggle, including Fitness, Intelligence, Charisma, Stress, Money, and Homework. Homework is issued regularly every week, and has to be finished by the end of the week or could lower your grades. Money is required for various items you can buy to boost your stats or to visit various places around the city and can be earned through taking on jobs. Fitness, Intelligence, and Charisma are used in various challenges in school and competition. Finally, and it's the big one, is stress. MANY MANY activities cause stress, and it can be very difficult, especially on the first playthrough, to keep stress down to a reasonable level. When stress rises to a high level, it can cause you to get sick, become hospitalized, and (as you would expect) lead to a bad end.\n\nThen, on top of your character management, there's the relationship aspect. As the store description indicates, early in the game, you make a bet with your sister that you would have a girlfriend at the end of the year. There are four girls you can pursue a relationship with (not including your sister, who doesn't have a route or any romance associated with her excluding a minor achievement), and pursuing romance with them requires a small conversational mini-game that you can play any time you go to lunch or visit various places around the city. There is some RNG involved in how often a girl shows up, and different girls show up in different places at different rates, so if you are pursuing a specific girl, it may difficult to get an encounter with her initially unless you consult a guide that shows the statistical chance of finding a girl in a specific location. Through this conversational minigame and also by getting girls gifts, you can unlock their routes roughly towards the middle of the game, and you do get to pick which girl you want to pursue as long as you have unlocked their route.\n\nSo yeah, as you might be able to deduce from above, it's an especially complicated game for a visual novel, and there's a lot more complexity to the game than mentioned above. Is it worth playing? For better or worse, the stat management is the primary time component of the game. Even if you play on Waifu mode (easiest mode), you'll probably be spending nearly 4 hours of an estimated 5 hour playthrough per route grinding away on daily activities that award various stats for yourself, your relationships, or your clubs. If you play on Normal or the incredibly statistically unfair Space Whale mode (which I'm doing for my current third playthrough), you'll probably be looking at seven hours or more per playthrough, assuming you can even make through the game without failing in one of the many different possible ways. The story itself doesn't require much interaction from the player. There are a few choices that you have to make, but there certainly aren't many, and at least the two routes that I have played so far have little player interaction or influence (in other words, stuff happens without you having to do anything).\n\nDespite all that, I still think the game is worth it. Yes, the stat management stuff might get boring after a playthrough, but the story is equal parts funny (in my opinion anyways) and cute, and the endings are especially happy (if you can make it through to the end). In addition, the game has some pretty good music, and even though I've heard it for many hours now through my (currently) 10 hours of playtime, it doesn't seem to grow old. I still enjoy listening to it in much the same way that I enjoyed Eden*'s music, though I find it unfortunate that Sunrider Academy's music is not available in soundtrack form. The visuals are...of course visual novel quality, which means 2D static art for the most part, but it is drawn very well, though for me it seems a bit...different from a traditional Japanese style visual novel.\n\nThere are a few concerns that I would like to mention for a prospective buyer. The cost is certainly one potential problem, and there aren't that many visual novels on Steam that cost this much. Then again, as mentioned before, there aren't very many visual novels on Steam that offer the same amount of gameplay either. The performance might also be a problem as well. The game seems to slow down in long sessions, probably due to some kind of memory leak. Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del to access the task manager seems to make the transitions become too fast to read through in game, which can only be fixed by a game restart.\n\nIn summary (TLDR of sorts), if you are interested in visual novel games, this is certainly a good one to try. With four routes and a unique statistical management game, it will definitely be more involving than the average visual novel. The story is quite decent for a VN (though not as impactful and emotionally moving as Eden*) and quite funny in places to boot, and while the statistical management stuff might be difficult initially and become kinda grindy after a playthrough or two, it's probably still interesting enough to keep motivated to continue playing. If you are on the fence or still hesitant, there's both a demo for Sunrider Academy and the completely free Sunrider Mask of Arcadius to try first.","June 4, 2015","true","29.5"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","49","54","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/recommended/340730/","Yureina","Yureina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/","463 products in account","So while the "main" game is a galactic war drama thing that happens to have anime girls who sometimes do anime girl things when not fighting in bloody battles, this spin-off game is a full-blown high school dating sim. It's also a stat management game, which unfortunately ends up being the majority of what your playtime is. It isn't fun and there is alot of it to do. It's just a thing you are forced to go through until the next story event happens.\n\nNow the story stuff is pretty decent. There are four routes involving the four main girls from the original game (Ava, Asaga, Chigara, and Sola). And while it is sad that some of the other interesting characters are missing from this game (Icari), at least the ones that are here are good on their own. Also worth mentioning is the little sister, Maray, who manages to be both a huggable bundle of cuteness and the most annoying creature on the planet. I don't have any siblings, so... maybe this is how they are like? I am not sure.\n\nThe story routes, when you manage to play them after going through all that stat management BS, tend to have a comedic first half followed by a dramatic second half as unpleasant stuff happens. For anyone who is familiar with Key/VisualArts' VN's/animes (Kanon, Clannad, Little Busters!), then you know exactly what you are in for. And while what is found in this game is not quite as memorable, it is still decent and capable of delivering powerful emotions. Also, like the original Sunrider, Academy is filled with suggestive material (even without Claude), and a patch can turn this game into an eroge for people who are into that sort of thing.\n\nLastly, since this is a spin-off, you probably should play the main Sunrider game (which is completely free) before even considering this. References are in abundance, and some can be considered spoilers for events in the main game.\n\n...And here I come to an impasse. Normally I would recommend this game for its story and characters, but you spend less time with them than you do with an annoying stat management system that is just an irritating chore getting in the way of what is actually worth seeing in this game. And there is no "maybe" option on Steam, so I find myself in trouble.\n\nUltimately, I am going to choose yes because even if the stat stuff is stupid, a game patch (which you need to install manually for some reason) makes the lowest game difficulty (appropriately called "waifu mode") make the stat stuff basically impossible to fail at. So you can just set to that difficulty and breeze through all the nonsense to just focus on the story. It makes the game better, and screw anyone who would judge you for being a "noob" for setting a game to easy.\n\nBwee...","May 10, 2015","true","30.4"," 44 of 47 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","44","47","6","3"

A positive review for a visual novel. Not neutral or "somewhere-in-the-middle" or just plainly meh, but not meh enough to give it thumbs down. A true positive review for truly good game. And to be honest, I didn't expect this one to be good - creators of VNs with h-content often forget, that they are still creating VISUAL NOVEL, so a game that should be base on solid story and not merely anime boobs. Luckily, this title doesn't have that problem.\n\nPros:\n+Graphic. Let's start with something obvious here. Characters, CGs, backgrounds - everything looks good and consistent.\n+Music. It changes! I know, it shouldn't be something surprising, but after playing dozens of VNs with same looping music that never reflect the atmosphere of scenes... It truly is. And it's nice music too. Even the casual tune in the background that plays when you're raising stats is rather enjoyable and doesn't get annoying.\n+Plot. This is a school-life simulator with sci-fi elements. I must admit that the story is really well written. For the first half of the game it's very light-hearted and funny, but when you're on specific route, it get a bit darker and more serious turn.\n+Writing. Really good. Most of the time dialogues looks realistic. You know, like part of conversation that could happen in the real life, as oppose to dialogues in many VNs.\n+Characters. I'm surprised, but I actually liked all of characters. Little sister was a bit annoying, but she was supposed to be, so it didn't bother me. Other girls have their own personalities, they were unique and likeable. They were acting like people, you know, actual GIRLS instead of CUTE-SWEET-ALWAYS-INTO-YOU. (*cough* Princess Evangile. *cough*)\n+Protagonist. Funny! Liekable! Relateable! With his own personality. He actually says a lot of reasonable things about relationships and what is important for him in terms of love, instead of just being a perv. This is a huge contrast to most h-content VNs and even protagonists in general (male or female) - they often tend to lack personality and when you think about it, there is literally not a single reason why other characters would be interested in them. Here protagonist is really cool, reliable and friendly guy, so it's not surprising that he's gaining popularity.\n+Gameplay. This is a stat raising game, so if you don't like that, you may be a little annoyed with that aspect (though there are few difficulty levels, so even if you're not good with that sort of things, you should not have problems to finish the game). I enjoyed it very much. Not only you're raising your personal stats and earning money like in many VNs, but also managing three clubs and trying to make them win championship.\n+Challenging. If you don't like challenge - you set easiest difficulty and you're good to go. But if you like managing stats, there are higher difficulty to picks, which is awesome.\n+Setting. Game doesn't take place on Earth. It's alternate universe with alternate time system, many timeliness and typical science fiction stuff. Yet it's very well done and doesn't "override" the whole school-life concept.\n+Well done. Really. I haven't encountered any bugs, everything looks good, everything sounds good, you get all options you may need and of course big resolution - which, sadly, still isn't something "normal" even for very pricey VNs.\n\nCons:\n-Subjective route-specific things. I will mention them below.\n-Too long. The last three months of the game were the most boring ones. There wasn't many events, just few scenes, so basically you're just focused on raising stats. The bad thing is, at this point, if you were managing them well, you pretty much have it all under control, so... At this point you just clicking randomly to get to the next scene. And those doesn't happen often.\n\nRoutes:\nCurrently I just finished one route, but I'm planning to do more, so this review will be upgraded in near future. There won't be any plot-related spoilers here, just my opinion after finishing route.\n\nChigara - For the first half of the game I liked her the most, so that's why I went with her. To be honest though, her route was kind of awkward and disappointing. Instead of being just loveable, a bit shy girl, she turns out to be... Eee... Very child-like, and that bothered me a lot. Especially during H-scenes. She doesn't know anything about sex. And no, I don't mean the fact that she doesn't have experience. She acts like she literally have no idea how this works, so I felt kind of bad at this point. And her childlish-like behavior doesn't help. Also  if you let go the thing that you want, instead of fighting for it, you simply don't deserve it. So I started liking her a lot and ended up feeling kind of "meh" and "nope". Not sure if I would recommend her for a first route.","February 16","true","19.4"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","39","44","5","15"

I would recommend you to save it for the last...you know...save the best for last... :D\n--------------------------------------------------------\nTL;DR: Don't buy this game if you actually hate calculation OR expect an extremely deep storyline. You lose money, time, and this game gets a down vote....not actually nice or any side. Otherwise, gives this game a try and thumb up if you like.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nSo, why you may hate this game\n- Time management: This is probably why many people downvote this game. They find the time management thing stressful and repetitive.\nIt's true that 90% of this game involves time management, but the even on each month are not the same. That being said, different route many have different event also.\n- Storyline: since this VN focuses heavily on time management, it doesn't have a profound storyline with a bunch of plot twists.\nHowever, I think the story is really good, not  excellent, but still god. You can expect a few plot twists and  surprises here and there. Also, if you don't fall into bad end, then the ending is quite satisfied.\n- Difficulty:....actually...you can always change the difficulty to Waifu, seriously. Hating the game because it's hard...LOL..\n--------------------------------------------------------\nNow, why you may love this game (and why I stayed up until 2a.m to play it)\n- The calculation: I love calculation (Asian). It actually gives me more enjoy,emt tham spending hours and hours looking at the screen. So if you love calculation, you may want to buy it.\n- The story (again): Although some people may dislike the story, I find it really good. It's quite true and realistic.\n- The music: I think the music is really nice. I actually like the OP song.\n- Nice developers: I mean they distribute an official 18+ content patch...\n- DRM-free: something that benefits the gaming industry in general.","July 24, 2015","true","72.2"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","26","29","4","0"

Got through the first week of the demo and quickly decided I wanted to purchase the game fully. It runs smoothly and has neat and accessible menus. Lots of cute character animations, improved art, and a pretty solid soundtrack so far. I wonder if the voice actors will return for this game?\n\nJuggling your home, school, and love life turned out to be a lot more challenging than I expected. I went into it with a Long Live the Queen mindset and while that helped I'm still not quite sure if I'm doing the right thing, ^^;  Make sure to save-scum because I'm sure in the harder modes and in the end-game you'll need all the bonuses you can get.\n\nI can't say much in regards for the story and relationships just yet but I'm keeping hopes up for this one. I would gladly pay 30$ for Mask of Arcadius so I don't doubt this game is worth the same. :D\n\n* * *\n\nReview pt.2 - Update -small NOT plot relevant spoilers ahead-\n\nSo I'm nearing the completion of the 3rd month of the in-game calendar. It becomes much easier to handle club activities after you've properly prepared the stats for their first challenges. My only concern is the Fitness stat for I have yet to see that skill come into play so far so it kinda leaves one wondering what it's for...?\n\nKnowing none of the routes are complete yet, it's hard to say no to any of the girls. (Turning down sweets for a certain someone felt so bad but I must remain vigiliant for the true waifu >_>)\n\nThe story has a nice, slow pace; leaving enough time for each girl to tell a bit of their story. While that may not be good for the more thirsty gamers, I really appreciate it ^^ Script is decent and pretty consistent with its humour. Couple moments where Kayto's less than savvy comments bugged me a little. (Whining about the friendzone, girls should be into makeup/dating, blehblahmehboringpsssch e_o;; though I don't expect much from a vn I will say this one has been pretty good in this regard.)\n\nTalking to Maray nearly every time I want to go sleep feels redundant after a while. It's either make her laugh or get the whole siscon crack. And for what purpose? Is there a bonus for being friendly with your sister? I mean I try to be as nice as Kayto allows ;p\n\nOther than that it's pretty fun watching Kayto become more confident in his studies and taking pride in his job as club manager.

You will be doing more of that than engaging in story elements. It gets repetitive very quickly, and can easily send your character on a death spiral if you don't stay on top of it.\n\nEach of the girls themselves put the player on a second story arc for different late game endings. Although I appreciate the reality that girlfriends aren't simply handed to you on a silver platter, what I don't like is that you can enter one of these story arcs, miss a completely random encounter from week 3 or something that you would never have known about had you not looked up a guide for the game, and then have the story arc stall on you. This results in you reaching a mid to late game key calendar event without a girl willing to attend it with you, netting you a bad end.\n\nWhy let the player enter the story arc at all with the girl if something like that is going to ruin everything in the end? The player might even make it a few hours past entering the story arc before reaching the festival and then receiving bad end. Without at least one full playthrough, the player might not even be aware of their pending failure because of how heavily engrained the resource management gameplay is. Then, without looking up a guide, the player may fruitlessly try to recover and continue, simply hitting bad end over and over again because they didn't save early enough to hit any missing random encounters on the way through.\n\nIf it were not for the resource management gameplay, the game story line for all of the endings would likely last less than 10 hours. If the player plays the game on the lowest difficulty just so they might actually reach the ending, the gameplay itself will be boring and the fairly generic harem storylines won't make up for it.\n\nUnless all you really want is a resouce management game, this game isn't worth $30, and probably isn't worth buying on sale unless you just want to collect a pile of visual novels for the sake of it.","January 24","false","17.6"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","26","33","0","0"

The day system was unique and considerate. Using the Calendar and Stats bring a familiar pace from other games. Kinda reminds me of the unique old dating sims we had in newgrounds. However the game had a nice objective and way to explain how it works. As you help and grow with the team, so do the feelings.\n\nStory: Well seeing from S:MOA I believe that this was a nice change of pace. Wish the other characters got their roles in more like an expansion. The development introducing you in the beginning helped show lines connecting EVA and Maray and what she was kinda like. However there are priceless moments as you go along. I feel that in the game there was a definite amount of good time and revision brought to this.\n\nPersonal Thoughts: Well the 9 was due to the other game and hoping for some involvement however as you play through this game you kind of see a nice pull around from them. I truly enjoyed the idea of running as Vice President and Reliving a life style with an end date to score or be a bore. Maray as a BL fan was hilarious in my opinion. Sola's nature was truly nice. Chigara's story line truly made me think about her a bit more and developed a bit more affection. Asage well I'M THOROUGHLY Surprised. More so that I've grown to accept her Wild Side to be more acceptable. However only thing I kind of wished was like it would go past the whole after you get the girl and in the end you get more CGs and by the graduation year, by all you did, it shows a certain extra bonus CG or events. Nonetheless playing the game over during early access and back now has made me appreciate the characters even more. I truly found this game entertaining and would highly recommend it to many other VN and Dating Sim lovers as well as anime fans. You'll find a nice appeal and to be honest, they did a great job.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeta Early Access\n(First Log)\nThoughts so far 1/20/15\n\nSola: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER, silent swim club member (Reminds me of Nanasaki Ai and Mana Kawamura). I really do love what you did with her, please continue to do so.\n\nAsaga: I have grown to see a Haruhi appeal but has her finer moments. Needs more moments of fun as she is now and some more plot involvement.\n\nChigara: Typical but there was some drama I was not expecting on the route. Need more build up loving the story you created.\n\nMaray: PLEASE UNLOCK the Imouto route SOON\n\nAva: Okay I admit she has her finer moments here, needs more opening though.\n\nOther thoughts:\nInclude the others from Sunrider. I saw a mention of Claude. Please let Kryska, Icari, and the others be there too. Maybe even as a rival school? Chance of that or transfer student.\n\nNonetheless enjoyable work so far and I find it truly great this came to be.  Looking forward for more.","January 20, 2015","true","13.0"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","41","61","8","0"

There are no actual battles. This is more on the Novel side of VN's.\n\nEnjoyed the hard stratgy-based battle system in Sunrider? Unfortunately, that doesn't happen here.\n\nFelt like the characters were missing depth to them? Like it wasn't enough the first time you met them? Well, good news is, this kinda helps satisfy that need, but with a slight adjustment to their lives.\n\nPros:\n(More) character interraction than in Sunrider itself.\nMore background on each character.\nMaray is now in the story much more, and is pure hillarity.\nJokes...jokes and puns everywhere...\nSunrider references!\nGood soundtrack.\nContent, content everywhere!\nIt's an alternate unvierse, so technically, none of it is really them, but at the same time, it is. They are just on the same planet and not in space yet. Still enjoyable, but apparently, this is a Con? Why?\nCONS:\nIt's an alternate unvierse, so technically, none of it is really them, but at the same time, it is. They are just on the same planet and not in space yet. Still enjoyable, but apparently, this is a Con? Why?\nCan be very repetitive...very repetitive..by Month 5 (half way through), I found the perfect balance to keep my game going perfectly, no chance for a "bad end" aka Game Over. It was almost pointless to do that for the next 5 months...so I modded it.\nTime passes very slowly.\nLots of decisions, and if you suck at making decisions/like to see all routes, good luck. It took me a while as well.\nIt takes time to develop the perfect system/balance to keep your game from ending badly, but it is possible, and there will be rough patches. Trial and Error are best.\nNo art mods allowed so I can't make kenomimi out of the cahracters.\nA little more:\n\nThis game is based more around the characters and their personalitites, and...dating them...and maybe get lucky with 1 of the 4 waifu's 3 because Ava doesn't count. Kidding.\n\nAs a die-hard Chigara fan, I am finding that even Ava has more depth to her and is becoming more of a person than she was in the original game, and I  HATE  Ava (more like, I didn't make a connection with her and can't see her as waifu material).\n\nThe jokes, puns, and Sunrider references are everywhere, and it adds a lot to the game. If you play this, and you want all the fun from it, play Sunrider until at least the start of Chapter 7.\n\nAnything else is up to you. If you want more out of the characters, I suggest you get this game. If you don't like the balance system, mod it like I did.

A little bit of bad RNG can make it all go terribly wrong and it's really hard to come back, making you save the game a lot and downloading old save files in hopes of making better decisions/having better luck.\nWhen the game is at a point where your stress levels are so high that you can't do anything and you have no money it just becomes hopeless. There are strategies that work in this game but most of the gameplay is just figuring out how the game\neven works and abusing it, which is not enjoyable to me.\n\nI do enjoy the characters a lot, so I just need to overcome my competitive nature and play it on the easiest difficulty or something. The main gameplay took so much of my attention and I ended up not even caring about the girls, instead just trying to figure out ways to win the seemingly RNG contests and keep my stress levels acceptable. It's just way too easy to make the whole game unwinnable.","April 20, 2015","false","4.7"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","38","57","4","1"

The grind is tedious and completely pointless. Most of the stats have little to no impact on the game. And this grind occupies a HUGE portion of the game, which would otherwise be quite short.\n\nThe experience would be much better overall if the game featured 5-6 short stories traditional VN way with branching depending on action/dialogue choices. I say short because that's how it would be without all the grind the player is asked to go through. If the developers spent the time they spent on producing timemanager for this game on actual writing, the game would only benefit from thatm even if the increase in amount of text would be slight.\nTo conclude on bad things: the game fails to combine VN/eroge with timemanager.\n\nNow good things.\n- First, the game has very decent visual representation. Both sprites and backgrounds while not artisticaly exquisite (not that I really expect that from an eroge), but good nontheless. Good resolution, you can run it fullscreen without risk of suffering eye bleeding. Drawing style is always a matter of personal preference, but I personally liked it. It's detailed euough, even if not very complex.\n- Second, the game has a very likeable opening, some effort (or money) was definitely put in making it.\n- Third, soundtrack is good enough. Mostly light-hearted themes, with appropriate mood changes to be in line with the story development. It will get repeatative overtime, like on 15+ hours, but that's not it's fault, but the fault of timemanager (yet again)\n-Fourth. Very important thing. The developer provides restoration patch on their official site with no additional charge.\nThat's the way to do it, my friends. Steam policies are one thing, but the players should be given an acces to full experience if they so choose. Love in space did it right. Great respect.\n\nNext points are a matter of personal view, I place them both on a PLUS side.\n-Characters. I didn't expect really deep characters portrayal in a casual game to begin with. They are OK if you share the same approach. If you expect deep personalities, with complex problems, well, you will probably be disappointed. I do love to see "deep" characters, but this is just not a place to look for them.\nThey are cute, with some touch of individuality and represent differend moods and temperaments. That's all, measure that to your expectations.\n-The game isn't taking itself too seriously. It is light-hearted, self-ironic, laughs at the cliches it uses, Good thing for a casual game, could be a bad thing for something more serious.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nPLUS\n-good visuals\n-very nice opening\n-decent sound\n-cute girls\n-official restoration patch that is immediately available from the developer if you need it\n\nMINUS\n-the game fails to combine time management aspect with eroge, it would be better without a timemanager at all, even if that would make the game significantly shorter\n\nConclusion:\nSimple, but pleasant experience, that for me was NOT ruined despite absolutely unncecessary grind of poorly implemented timemanager.\nActually, in this particular case I'm willing to pay for a DLC that would cut the damn timemanager out, add another 50% of text and turn the Sunrider Academy into a short traditional VN/eroge with actual choices and story branching instead of grind.\nLooking forward to new eroge/VN from Love In Space if they decide to make some. Maybe something more serious this time? Just PLEASE, don't include timemanagers if you're not planning to flesh them out properly.\n","April 25, 2015","true","16.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Here are my thoughts.\n\n-\n\nFirst, I noticed that the graphics are improved from Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius. That's cool. You also have good use of chibi sprites, although I wish there was a little more variations during the competitions (Bronze, Silver and Gold having slightly different victory animations). I like the background, and they feel quite clean and modern.\n\n-\n\nThe music is okay. There are just enough 'weekday' BGMs and 'weekend' BGMs so that they don't feel tiring to hear even after hours of gameplay, and the ones that do matter, the ones that are emotional are beautiful. Good to see one of the best asset of the Arcadius has not deteriorated coming into Academy.\n\nI do wish that you'll add some voice acting in. I just love Sola's voice so much.\n\n-\n\nNow then, about the content. To be entirely honest, it feels really bare and empty at the moment. You have 100 days in a month, and most of those days are spent trying to beef up your stats and especially money so as to get a good result in competitions and exams.\n\nThe problem is that there is too much time, and too little content. For example, there aren't enough 'common' route scenes, scenes that automatically happen and does not require you to explore and discover. The first month is almost fine with the beginning scenes, the club captain meetings, the club competitions, Asaga screw up, final exams and festival. There may be 1 activable scene for each heroine if you visit the right places, which is okay.\n\nBut the second month is seriously bare. I'm assuming that there are again, 1 activable scenes for each heroine - I've found Asaga's at the arcade and Ava's at the student council room - some imouto scenes, and 1 common Ava scene at the end, but otherwise, almost nothing happened at all. Note that if this is the normal 30 days a month, this volume of content enough. However we are going through 50 days per month, and due to the nature of dating sims one can't help but save scum a little, which increases playtime more than it already is. To be entirely frank, at the end of Month 2 I was bored as hell.\n\nEven worse, suppose that you're going for top rank for every competition, you actually do need all 50 days, spending as much time beefing the clubs, doing temp jobs at the Science Center, Strolling to reduce Stress and buy as many Readiness item as you can. And I've gotten the $50 Blanket from the beginning. After all the micromanagement I barely have a few days buffer which you again work frantically for the next club competition.\n\nIt was only near the end of Month 2 that I 'remembered' that this is a dating sim game, and that I should be looking about in different locations for extra scenes rather than buffing my stats even more, and I was incredibly reluctant to do so because ♥♥♥♥, I need to get that Retry Charm so the Swimming Club won't fail four days in a row because of I-have-no-idea-which-stats is screwing me up.\n\nAnd as you add in more months into the game, the bar keeps rising higher, me as the player just will never have enough motivation to look out for additional scenes, which ironically is probably going to give me a  'YOU GOT NO GIRLFRIEND' bad end except probably Ava.\n\nYou try to keep us busy while keep the game balance by adding in negative stats when sleeping or doing certain activities - which I'm totally fine with, and is actually pretty realistic - but the ones that penalizes stats when visiting certain locations also greatly discourages exploration. For example I should be going to the Arcade often if I'm gunning for Asaga. but the fact that it gives -2 Int and -$2, with a possibility of failure leading to more penalty, just feels... well, maybe there's a better way.\n\nOn the other hand, visiting the Science Center is absolutely awesome. +3 Int, -1 Stress for just $2? Sign me up. It's just feels... like it can be balanced better. Again, one can almost forget this is a dating sim, because I care far more about getting better stats than trying to win the girls. Winning the girls become a side quest, one that can be ignored at least for the beginning months, and that's just really awkward in my opinion.\n\nOf course, many of the above can be remedied with more fixed scenes of the girls. To begin with, I get to know them better. 100 days and 2 months into the game and I barely know, like, ANYTHING about them at all. With exception to the Ava scene at the end of Month 2, almost everything else is clown-ish scenes with no impact whatsoever. The Asaga ones are especially forgettable. Funny, but totally forgettable.\n\nFixed scenes also automatically raises the bar since that's one whole period lost, and then you can lower the penalties to encourage further explorations, which leads to people discovering activable scenes and start feeling that they're playing a dating sim.\n\nThe first 3 months should hook people into the game, not bounce them away with chores. It shouldn't be following a curve like X-Com's. I wouldn't mind if this bareness happen during say, Month 5 and beyond - at that point I should be know quite a bit about the girls in general, feeling good about it and at the same time somewhat frantic that I have little time to meet the next bar. That is when I'd like an empty month where I can really focus on the clubs and money, and not when I want to understand more about the girls.\n\n-\n\nAbout characters.\n\nAsaga is quite funny at the beginning, with all the references and stuff. Hilarious even. But beyond the opening, she's like... non-existent. Maybe it's because this is just the beginning, and I heard there are more stories about her in Month 3. It just... she probably needs 1 more common scene (maybe all the girls do) in Month 2.\n\nChigara's standpoint is even worse than Asaga. She's just... I don't know. I'll wait.\n\nSola is... I know I shouldn't compare, but in Arcadius I feel like both her character and story is far more interesting and well-paced than here. Still, she has more character development than either of the above so it's cool.\n\nYou love Ava, don't you (or hate her the most - the point here is that it seems that you feel the strongest for her I think?)? One  papa scene and I feel completely captured by her. I think this is mostly the influence from Arcadius, but really.\n\n-\n\nAbout system.\n\nYou have all the basics in, and I believe you'll tweak the UI once you've completed the game. Text is too large (when in Arcadius it's too small, unless you're playing on a laptop), it's kind of cool and annoying at the same time you can totally flood the screen with every option possible - a bit more order here, surely. I don't think I need to comment on this, it's obvious this will be enhanced in the future.\n\nThe transition delay is a Ren'Py problem so it's cool.\n\n-\n\nThat's it for now. At the end of Month 2 I'm reluctant to continue further, but I will finish until Month 3 and see if the impression changes. In Arcadius (which is a masterpiece; I still can't quite believe it's below 300 MB btw unless I accidentally swapped this game's size with that one) the gameplay is absolutely addictive, and even though I want to CRY that I have to switch Ensign Mode due to poor playing at the beginning - leading to lesser $, lesser CP, lesser upgrades which ultimate leads to impossible Captain Mode victory for the final 3 missions - I actually WANT to restart and play it again because it's just so fun. And the epic, epic music - god I just love that game.\n\nBut the current Sunrider Academy just feels like a chore, and that needs to be remedied somehow. And that's my review. Thank you very much for making both these games!","January 22, 2015","true","16.0"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","22","33","3","0"

One, it has the same characters as Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, which is a free game by the same people, if you want to sample the characters and writing before buying this. The writing here is great, and the stories are surprisingly good. I really enjoy every character. The art is very nice.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game however, is that it ends up being very grindy. A single playthrough of this game can take around 8-10 hours, and there is still a possibility of failure on the harder difficulties. Most of that time is spent performing the same actions over and over, planning out every hour of your 400 day school year. It gets very tedious. Best to play this game in short bursts.\n\nI think the writing of this game makes up for it, but I do understand if the manegement causes too much boredom.\n\nTo me, not quite worth 30 $, but you can get it on one of the steam sales.","February 26","true","37.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This is far from what i actually got.\n\nSunrider Academy is a tedious slog of repeating the exact same daily events with the exact same text, over and over again ad nauseum. The only respite is the occasional conversation with one of the main characters, which consists of them saying hi and you selecting a chat topic which then ends the conversation.\n\nThe biggest problem i found is that the interactions with the characters happen very infrequently, often not at all for days at a time in the game, you'll find yourself repeating those tasks over and over just waiting for a club competition to take place, or someones birthday, or a holiday event so you actually get some of the story.\n\n90% of the game is based completely on RNG, your job, classes, club activities / recruitment etc are all RNG based as to whether you succeed or fail no matter how you do your stats. Which is a big negative for me in a game supposedly based on stat management. For me the game also crashes constantly on Windows 10 forcing me to literally save after every few actions or lose my progress.\n\nWhile the storyline is good when you get parts of it and the characters are quite likeable, i feel i can't recommend this game based on the issues outlined above.","December 29, 2015","false","12.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

Good story. Bad gameplay execution.\n\nPROS:\n+ Has a great well thought out story and the VN parts of every route that is new to you are very enjoyable.\n+ Dem H scenes. (Be sure to get the Uncensor Patch)\n+ Got to tap waifus.\n\nCONS:\n- Repetitive gameplay. Wake Up, School, Lunch, School, One Club Thing, Job/Visit, Maybe Talk to a Girl, Sleep Rinse Repeat. Midweek + Weekends: Same thing except replace school with another club activity.\n\n- Too much of a grind even when in waifu mode. After a few hours, you will quickly lose your excitement and realize you are just clicking away like a zombie.\n\n- Gets more boring as the game progresses, you don't meet girls after maxing their affection, after that, only one girl that you pick for their story arc and you only see them on certain days as the VN story events, like wtf why? They just can't approach you anymore or something cuz they have cooties?\n\n- Takes a total of +4 in game months to just start a route and develop a story and relationship with a girl. I know realistically, I guess it would take 4 months to build a relationship as well as the courage to ask a girl out but come on, this is a game for poor sad depressed people like me that can't get a girlfriend no matter how hard they try. Well at least that is my story. I think we can all sympathise in some way to that.\n\n- Can't tap Icari/Full Main Cast of Sunrider\n- Can't tap sexy Fontana\n- Can't tap Maray: Incest = Wincest\n- Can't tap the Space Whale.\n- Can't play more than 1 route at a time. No harem ending.\n\n(If you can't tell, the last few "cons" are more personal preference and jokes. Though they would be nice to actually have in game.)\n\nOverall: Buy it on sale. In my opinion, play through the game once fair and square. After that, by all means, feel free to use the dev console to get through the game faster and easier. You will definitely feel emotional as you experience each story with each girl, living your life as if you were an actual student, dealing with all the stress of managing everything, yet doing it all so you can impress your little sister, and ofc be able to build an emotional and lifelong relationship with your waifu. Each story arc is well written and will bring out the feels. A very nice game in my opinion for the story, the actual gameplay of the stat managing needed some reworking and more options to feel more in depth and meaningful. In the end I still overall enjoyed the game, but for those with low tolerance levels for boredom and/or don't know how to mod in the dev console, I wouldn't recomend this game for you.","February 17","true","15.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","0"

Clunky doesn't even begin to describe it. And losing stats when you sleep? Whose bright idea was that.

In Asaga's route, it is very emotional as something have happened ( *not gonna give spoiler for that* but there is like a short plot twist which suit perfectly to the route)\nIt's like i have fallen in love with Asaga that's why i choose her route.

My review will cover several topics including Art, Music, Writing, Stat management, and other little bits.\n(overall rating: 5.5/10) The game is NOT bad, but it's not good.\n\nThe concept of the game is great and allows for 4 different playthoughs. In the beginning you are very engaged with the other characters Chigara, Asaga, Ava, and Sola. Overall the stories are OK, but I will go into Sola's Arc a little more specifically because i was seriously dissapointed with it compared to the others. The game does have h-scenes that can be installed by a patch. I'm not really into the whole "hentai" thing, but i always advise that one should install the patches just for the sake of having the complete game and not missing out on any information. Without the patch certain scenes will pop up with a blue error screen instead of the normal screen. (because theres boobies duh)\n\nArt\nThe art in this game was very well done. All characters have been well drawn, the scene backgrounds are fantastic, and the characters don't just stand in the same position. The charactes move around as the conversation continues, allowing for a more fluid/realistic feel of the game that keeps your attention.\nVerdict- 8/10\n\nMusic\nI never found the music in the game to be repettitive or annoying. It was implemented well and very fitting to the situations they are for. There are a total of (I think) 63 music files.\nVerdict- 7/10\n\nStat Management\nThe stat management in the beginning of the game is not bad at all. There are constant encounters with the 4 girls that helps the game flow smoothly. After you choose a girl to pursue, the game evolves into a mindless grind. There are less encounters with the other characters as the game progresses and it makes the game very hard to play. Be prepared to grind the heck out of school, club, and then free time because each of the playthroughs lasts at least 6 hours if you take your time.\nVerdict- 3/10\n\nSola Arc *Spoiler alert*\nSola's arc was a very well thought out idea that she is the "shadow" of another preson in an alternate universe so in theory she shouldn't exist. She has these "disconnections" that occur throughout the story that seem to stopped by the power of love (So cheezy). There seems to be a god/being that can allow her to coexist in both your universe and the origional universe that she is origionally from but for no real reason the god/being decides to not allow it until you undoubtedly prove your love and dedication for her. My main gripe about Sola's story is that it never goes into detail about the god/being at all. Even though it has full control over Sola's existence it never states what it exactly is and only has a few lines in the entire game. Also it seems that either the company ran out of time, money, or patience when releasing the game becasue all other endings include a nice summarization of your future along with pictures. Sola's arc did not. It is a very forced ending that is accompanied with a black screen. A crappy way to end what could have been the best story line of the game.","February 2","true","519.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","3"

This is a cluster of drop-down menus in disguise.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but after experiencing the merciless grind first-hand, I simply can't recommend it. It is HOURS upon HOURS of clicking through the same drop-down menu driven stat management (Ruled over by a RNG that's out to make you lose faith in humanity) in order to get at the few moments of character interaction. In all honesty I think the split is about 85/15 in terms of what you'll be doing, and that's just not acceptable.

Honestly the game isn't for everyone, but if you are willing to be open to a new exotic and sexual experience with a game (not litterally) then maybe give it a try.\n\nIf you are wondering if its just going to be tittalation and all sex! sex! sex!. Well then you'd be right depending on whether or not you have the cut content mod. If you don't have that its a good balance of romance and lust which lends its self to make you want to keep playing because you'll want to find out what happens next. The great thing about this romance approach is the fact that every romance is different for every girl which will allow you to take certian approaches based on their interests. This makes the play time even longer. For me at least it took me 30 hours to complete Asaga's arc and I'm not even finished with the others yet so it will be even longer.\n\nOne problem with this game is the gameplay or atleast the constant amount of time nothing is happening and all you are doing is clicking. Although once things start happening they "START ♥♥♥♥ING HAPPENING!".\n\nThe amount of emotions this game go from me is astonishing. At one point I am in love and the other point I'm crying IRL lol.\n\nThis is a bad review but whatever, I give this game a 9/10.","March 5","true","57.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

I just thought it was a dating sim where you go and touch buuts with a bunch of highschool girls. There's alot of that, yes, but what amazed me is that the story was actually really good. Each route has a really different and interesting story that got me pretty emotionally invested in it. You can also get a patch that implements the lewd scenes back into the steam version, so that's definitely a plus. The only main problem I really had is that it took me about 12 hours to complete a single playthrough from very start to finish. There's also times where the story isn't very well spread out and feels light in some areas. At the time of this review I've completed two routes and the endings were both fairly satisfying and wrapped things up quite nicely in my opinion. I plan on finishing all 4 just because of how good the first 2 stories were. If you're looking for a dating sim that has a decent story, I totally recommend picking this game up.\n\nTLDR: Good story and some lewd scenes.

Even then I was a little unsure of spending even that much on something of this type. After playing it through all the way on each path, I must say it was well worth the discounted price, and probably the full price even. The story telling is engaging and interesting. In fact, many of the stories are downright fun. So many of these type of visual novels rely solely on explicit content to make it interesting. This story has that aspect (provided you install the patch), but my first play through did not have the patch and I felt the story was excellent even without. The stat management angle makes you have to put some thought into the story too, rather than just mindlessly clicking through.\n\nAs mentioned in the cons section, the stats management does become a bit repetitive at times. There are often long period between advancements in the storyline where you just go about your day to day activities. While in gameplay this can be a con, it can also be seen as mirroring real life, though some of the situations you're left questioning why an event that took place can have days go by without consequence or reaction. Keep in mind this game is LONG [9 months made of of 5 weeks, made up of 10 days] . With 4 paths to follow, either make a savepoint before you choose your path (roughly mid month 4 before you reach Pure Day, depending on stats), or be aware that you'll be redoing a lot of repetitive management to fulfill each storyline.\nAnother con mentioned was continuity. I did find that if you did not trigger certain encounters at the proper times, they could show up out of sequence. An example being if you do not meet with a club leader at the right time before the first competition, you may complete the competition, then the next day visit the club leader and have a discussion about preparing for that meet you’d just completed.\n\nAfter building a connection with these characters, I was pleased to find that a lot of them are in two other games put out by this author. I plan on playing through those as well so I can get more out of these storylines.\n\nOverall 10/10","May 28","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also, I played the game using the optional uncensor-patch provided by the devs. Check the pinned discussions in the games forums, I recommend using it, the added content is tasteful and serves to further develop characters, as well as provide greater emotional connection to the characters.\n\nOkay, so now that I have finished the game, I've decided to completely redo my review. First things first: Before you play this, at least play through most of the original game, Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius. It is free, it is wonderful, and this game contains a lot of references to that one. Seriously, it's phenomenal, free or not, and it's not even finished, another episode will be added later this year.\n\nThis games biggest weakness is pacing, both story-wise and gameplay-wise. The story pacing issues are made worse by the gameplay pacing issues, as sometimes reaching a certain even or fulfilling the requirements to trigger an event can either take a very long time, or if you didn't manage things well or hadn't yet figured out the game in the case of triggering an event, attempts to do so can make things more difficult for you.\n\nThe beginning of the game is very fast and doesn't explain itself well, and the end becomes a mindless cycle after the first go because nothing really matters at that point. For a game that requires multiple playthroughs to experience all the stories, the gameplay lacks variety, as the majority of the requirements are identical for each route. That said, once it's figured out, you can speed through the downtime fairly quickly, and if you find the stat managing gameplay unenjoyable or too difficult, there is a mode that makes it impossible to fail, so you can just experience the story, which is well worth the price alone, in my opinion.\n\nAs for the story, pacing is inconsistent. Each of the routes is paced differently, which is both good and bad. Good in that it keeps things varied, bad in that a couple of sections in a couple of the 4 routes available feel... slow. I found myself growing impatient, made worse by the fact that I was reaching the point in the game where the gameplay becomes a mindless routine where nothing is really significant. The slow sections have a purpose, and in the context of the story alone are understandable and meaningful, if not the most engaging, but they are made somewhat frustrating by the monotony of the gameplay during that portion of the route.\n\nThat pretty much covers the slightly more objective issues with the game. I personally don't really have many other criticisms, and no major ones to speak of. The music of the game is nice, but the tracks are rather short, and they loop during any given section, which can be annoying during particularly long story sequences. It didn't bother me much, but I did notice. Other little things include minor typos and slightly awkward phrasing, which were noticeable but didn't take away from the writing in any real sense.\n\nSo, on to the things that I like about the game. The writing is really strong. The stories that are told have great variety, strong plot twists, and generally have a lot of impact. The characters all have unique personalities and grow throughout the game, changing in various ways, doing unexpected things and genuinely surprising the player. This is true for all the routes, I found the stories told to be engaging, emotional, fun and heartwarming, and they all have their fair share of laughs. The support characters are all very interesting as well.\n\nOn to the art style. Its anime, okay? If you don't like anime, why are you here? That said, I don't feel that the art is generic or cliche. The character designs are all reasonably grounded, there are no crazy hair or overly stylized outfits, and each of the characters are easily distinguishable by more than just hair. The backgrounds are satisfactory. A couple of them are quite exceptional, the rest are just okay, but none of them are bad. The CG's are all nice as well, and while I do have my personal favorites, that is going to be a very personal preference, and all were of good quality.\n\nTL:DR: This game has its issues. The first playthrough is tense and fun, well paced with common events, the following 3 to finish the remaining routes suffer from a lack of challenge and slower pacing due to already having experienced the common events. Outside of that, I absolutely adored this game, and didn't feel that these issues lessened my enjoyment too greatly. The characters are great, the writing does nearly everything right, there is a lot of variety story-wise, and the art is all high-quality and thoroughly enjoyable. I wholeheartedly recommend this one, but if you have yet to play the original game, Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, play it first. It is great, it's free, and it makes this game a better experience.","April 29, 2015","true","32.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When I discovered the game, I was kind of lost, because of all the stats, the need of regularizing them and the complete lack of information provided by the game towards the stats and their effect, but I was interested into the story unfolding so I hung up and continued. I did an entire 100% legit playthrough, saving often, clicking thousand of times, went with one of the girl's route (Chigara) and was pleased with the story, but completely exhausted at the end of my playthrough with all the clicking. I tried resuming one of my older save and go with an other route, but I quickly realized how I couldn't stand the fact of going through months of the same old clicking on tags for hours just to unveil minutes of dialogues and story. And so I decided to abandon the game and not even see the entirety of what was to see.\n\nI'm not saying that the game is bad, but if you are wondering about buying it, just do know that you'll have to go through  ten thousand clicks on the same map for hours, repeating always the same things again and again, just to unlock new routes and uncover the story, and that you'll have to do it four times to date the four girls. If you can manage to do that, then you might enjoy the game. If not, consider buying another visual novel where the story unfolds more easily.\nIt's really a pity, because the art was good, the music very good, as the writing, but the game itself, the mechanics, well are just the most boring clickfest I have ever seen, and while it was acceptable for a playthrough, it is not for many, at least for me. And not wanting to play a game when you know you've only seen a quarter of it is very disappointing. You can see the scenes by using the developers' console, but I suggest you to buy a book instead, it is less laborious and thus more fun. In the end, the game became less of a game and more of a chore. Never mind !","March 9","false","16.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Management sims like this are kind of new to me, so it took me a while to get into it, and I had to lower the difficulty to helper mode.\n\nThe story was mostly good (keep in mind that I played the Ava Route), although a few scenes seemed kinda strange, like the plot was being forced for one reason or another. The pacing was slow. There are 500 days in this game, but sadly most of them didn't have anything interesting going on. Now I'm not saying that every day should have had something going on, but a bit more here and there would have been more than welcome, and I do hope the developers intend to flesh things out in the future.\n\nThe music was fantastic. There were several times when I stopped playing simply to listen. Some tracks start to feel repetetive, but like I said, 500 days... so I'd be very surprised if nothing started to seem repetetive.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game was good, but could use some work, and I know it has the potential. A few last things to note:\n\n- The game seems very stable. I only ran into a couple of bugs, neither of which were game breaking, or even annoying at all, really.\n- There are plenty of spelling/grammar mistakes, and these seem to increase in frequency as the game continues.\n- The interface could use some work. The buttons have a square hitbox (or whatever you call it), yet the buttons are hexagons, so you may often click on a menu you didn't want.\n- The rewind feature seems to get confused when rewound to the first line of a scene, which is when it's most needed. This doesn't really cause much issue though.\n- What kind of sound is mou?! Do they all have cow accents? I don't understand!\n- What in the galaxy is holowear?! I need to know!!!\n\nIt may sound like I'm being hard on the game, but I really did enjoy, and I hope to see some improvements to make it even better. And I fully intend to try another route.

As a fan of VN games I rate this one as an absolute must have, and I've only finished one of the four character arcs. I was skeptical of the game at first, and I especially didn't want to pay the high price for a game that was in essence a VN, but after almost 13 hours I am more than satisfied with my purchase. I don't play many stat management games so I won't bother to try to review that portion, but from a VN perspective the story is wonderful with fun, relatable characters and just enough fantasy to pull you out of the real world. Another point in it's favor is that there are many different levels of difficulty, ranging from so easy it's almost impossible to lose (for those of you just seeking a new waifu) to hard enough that you actually need some experience in stat management games to get a good ending. I had only one issue with the game in my first playthrough and that was I got a bad ending without warning and had saved past the point I could avoid it and hard to start over further back then I would have liked, but again that only happened once and I was willing to continue playing through the bad ending because of how much I enjoyed the game. I reccomend this game 100%, I also recommend that if you are 18+ then you download the 18+ patch from the developer's website (if you think anime girls are smexy that is). Finally I also recommend the game this game was based off of, Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius. I haven't played that game all the way through yet but even with the small amount I played it I was able to enjoy some inside humor that was put into Sunrider Academy.","August 3, 2015","true","26.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Did you enjoy the female characters?\n\nWell, now you get to see their boobs and see that they are all incredibly creepy and quite literally insane.\n\nNot sure if all VN/Dating Sims are like this, but jeez. Pretty much all of the characters are mental and quite often you find yourself going "Why is my character trying this hard just to get laid? This is so not worth it."\n\nThe stories are unique enough and interesting. The girls are still likeable when the writer doesn't suddenly go off the rails and make a story about parental abuse or... huh, come to think of it, all 4 of the girls have some HUGE form of parents abusing their kids as a major factor of the drama. Only just realised that when typing this up. Weird.\n\nBut yeah, it's a fun enough game, good for a single play through for each route if you can get past how slow paced and dull the club management bit can be. The storylines always start off quite nice and cute and then some massive forced drama is included to ruin your relationship and then it gets better again, the end.\n\nSola is the most boring route in my opinion, Ava's is bad to start with but gets better, Chiagara's is the most head scratching and Asaga's is best overall.\n\nJust need DLC for Kryska, Claude and Icari and I'd be happy.\n\n\n\n........would be far happier if they put a Maray route in. So not ashamed, their interaction is often the best and funniest.","April 24, 2015","true","55.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Management sims like this are kind of new to me, so it took me a while to get into it, and I had to lower the difficulty to helper mode.\n\nThe story was mostly good (keep in mind that I played the Ava Route), although a few scenes seemed kinda strange, like the plot was being forced for one reason or another. The pacing was slow. There are 500 days in this game, but sadly most of them didn't have anything interesting going on. Now I'm not saying that every day should have had something going on, but a bit more here and there would have been more than welcome, and I do hope the developers intend to flesh things out in the future.\n\nThe music was fantastic. There were several times when I stopped playing simply to listen. Some tracks start to feel repetetive, but like I said, 500 days... so I'd be very surprised if nothing started to seem repetetive.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game was good, but could use some work, and I know it has the potential. A few last things to note:\n\n- The game seems very stable. I only ran into a couple of bugs, neither of which were game breaking, or even annoying at all, really.\n- There are plenty of spelling/grammar mistakes, and these seem to increase in frequency as the game continues.\n- The interface could use some work. The buttons have a square hitbox (or whatever you call it), yet the buttons are hexagons, so you may often click on a menu you didn't want.\n- The rewind feature seems to get confused when rewound to the first line of a scene, which is when it's most needed. This doesn't really cause much issue though.\n- What kind of sound is mou?! Do they all have cow accents? I don't understand!\n- What in the galaxy is holowear?! I need to know!!!\n\nIt may sound like I'm being hard on the game, but I really did enjoy, and I hope to see some improvements to make it even better. And I fully intend to try another route. Maybe they'll even add more of those. (No, stop it James, you're getting greedy!)...please.","April 23, 2015","true","22.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Finally finished all 4 routes. Here is my personal opinion/breakdown: The stories within are decently fleshed out with each character's story being some of the most insane I've seen in this type of game. Even though you know deep down you have to end up winning, there are many times you just get knocked back with something so bizzare or tragic happening (usually both), that it rips your mind out of your head, gives it a few good whacks with a rock, then crams it back into your skull.  So, pretty solid story all round, even with a few good plot holes that are never addressed.  Now the gameplay is another matter entirely.  As of this writing, I have 62 hours sunk into this game, and I'd have to say 60 of them were me pulling what little hair I have out in sheer annoyed stat grinding boredom.  I know this is part stat sim, but in a mostly negitive way.  The constant grinding of stats, added onto the chance of missing an important event just because you don't have enough time in a day to check every single location without spamming your save/load buttons over and over and over again, will leave all but the most hardcore stat grinding lovers weeping in pain.  Personal hate: Month 5 = PURE DAY.  This was a hell plain and simple.  I got a "Bad End" on this day and had to retract 1-3 months of gaming time and never could figure out what I did differently to get through it.  The game doesn't hold your hand in the least either. I played it through the first 2 times on the supposed easiest mode: Waifu, and yet still ended up with the bad end on Pure Day again and again.  By my 3rd playthrough, i was so damn paranoid about missing anything I was saving/reloading every 5 seconds so I could check EVERY possibility EVERY day.  Still, all in all this was a solid visual novel. It did desperately need more story and less stat sim though. I still chuckle when, after a really heavy emotional scene complete with dire music, suddenly it's the next day at school and happy study music is playing again and you may go another 2 weeks to a month without the story advancing another inch.  I still suggest this game to any fans of the genre, but I hold FIRMLY to waiting until it's ON SALE.  30 bucks is way too much considering it's a time sink not unlike an iPhone game.  Oh, lest I forget, you CAN PATCH THIS to the full version if you visit the developers website. The instructions are easy and, quite honestly, make this game worth playing. I can't even imagine sludging through it without the adult parts!  I would have cried and died of boredom.","April 29, 2015","true","62.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadeShineDOTA/recommended/340730/","ShadeShineDOTA","Sunday Bloody Sundae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadeShineDOTA/","231 products in account","FAIR WARNING: the game as it is is currently neutered thanks to a silly policy of Steam's.  Be sure to download the patch that restores all content.  It's free and endorsed by the developers, because they know this policy is just a formality Steam has to inflict.\n\nYou can get it at sunrider(dash)vn(dot)com.\n\nAlso, I've played this game for about twelve hours, total, but steam doesn't believe it because I played it offline.\n\nNow, on to the proper review:  at the current point in time, I cannot recommend this game for the price offered.\n\nIt is a working, functional game, but it feels unpolished and honestly inferior to Sunrider Mask of Arcadius, which left something to be desired with the game design but ultimately felt like a better reading experience in general.  The presence of more characters helps to show more of those characters off by providing more interactions between them all.\n\nThe tone of the game feels more 'silly' than 'light-hearted', to the extent that even I found myself a little disappointed.  And the silliness doesn't work for it like the light-hearted but occasionally grim tone of Mask of Arcadius.  I understand why the game was limited to four routes (if you had to balance more than three clubs you'd be boned, probably), but I feel like inclusion of adaptations of other characters from the original game could have helped to flesh out the character interactions and make the game feel less empty.\n\nWith regards to the management sim part of the game, it often feels like most of my failures were due to 'tantrum spirals' rather than actual tactical errors.  'Failed' events bump stress, and you fail events with more stress.  Failed 'jobs' give you less money, which you primarily spend to win and to reduce stress.  Too much stress makes you unable to win the game...\n\nOf course, if you have any problems with the game on regular difficulty, you can easily win the game on the second difficulty level.  True to form, Love in Space has made the normal difficulty too hard for the average player...but this game is no where near as hard as Mask of Arcadius was (thanks be to whatever patron spirits are in charge of visual novels).\n\nI warn against playing on Waifu mode because it makes it too hard to control which girl you actually want to get with (you can't just duff 'random encounters' to keep a girl's affection from rising), but it does aptly fulfill its role.  I don't like the nature of the 'random encounters' either, but that comes with this territory.\n\nSola's route was the only one I've done so far, and it's okay, but there's an issue with a major plot point and how the Swim Club works between two certain points in the story.  I know it's a bit of handwavium, but I also feel like it should have been addressed somehow.\n\nWith regards to purchasing it, I would honestly wait until they put out a few patches to tighten it up a bit.  It's not a bad or broken game, but it's not a good one either.  I just don't like it, and I can't recommend it for the price it's offered at (even at the present sale) until they clean it up a bit.  I don't know if they PLAN to clean it up a bit, so buyer beware.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI've played the other three routes by now.\n\nI still like reading the scenes, but it still feels especially poor as a management sim, if only because of how grindy it is.\n\nChigara's route is a little iffy, but Chigara's not my favorite girl anyway.  I did like that it ended with babies and a bakery, because who doesn't love pregnancy?  (Well, okay, I like pregnancy)\n\nAva's route is totally Ava, tied for second best with Asaga.\n\nAsaga is awesome, as per usual.\n\nI don't understand what the heck 'mou' is or why Ceran women say things that make me think of cow sounds.","June 15, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I timed myself. I played for 5. Not saying it makes a huge difference, but I'm stating it to credit my experience with the game so far.\n\nI was a bit put off by this game at first. I was afraid it would end up being another one of those graphic novels in the guise of an actual game, however after reading a few existing reviews I bought it myself and was pleasantly surprised. This is a management game with actual gameplay, even if it is all revolved around being in the right menu at the right time and clicking words.\n\nI also wasn't very impressed with the character designs. Having a girlfriend that draws constantly, I've learned to pick details out of designs, and there wasn't anything overall impressive with these. However, this is due to a combination of setting, and the fact that the characters you meet in the game are more than just their appearance.\n\nSunrider Academy takes place, as is obvious, in an academy! Your job as the player is to take the role of a club manager, and to help several misfit, down-on-their-luck clubs get their members count, morale, and skills up in order to prevent them from being  discontinued. You also have to simultaneously keep your own skills up and complete your school work, as you are still a student. There's also this, arguably unnecessary, sub objective in which you need to get a girlfriend out of all of this, and since each club you help is being led by an adorable anime waifu, your not exactly short of girls to woo.\n\nIf you already are into these kind of games, you'll more than likely find yourself completely invested in both the characters and the gameplay in a matter of 30 minutes. They aren't the most original or well written characters either, but they are charming enough to keep you interested. There are some genuine moments in the story and dialouge, though most of my time was spent figuring out what the bloody ♥♥♥♥ I should do to keep my characters stress levels down!\n\nMy first two hours went by alright, as I helped get each club in order and even helped two of them win bronze and silver in competitions, but this was quickly lost in shambles as I neglected to find a consistent way of keeping my characters stress low. I tried playing games, sleeping early, buying eroge, but some of these actions cost money, which required a job, which adds more stress, which eventually spirals into you getting sick and then getting the "Bad Ending" of you being hospitalized. I know it's mostly my fault, but the RNG didn't exactly make it easy for me. Just be warned, it's definetely a game of patience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However this did end in my dumbass forgetting to save for over an hour, and having to restart quite a bit of progress.\n\nOverall, the art is nice to look at. There is no voiced dialouge, but the music is pleasant to listen to, and the gameplay can be addicting. Just don't try to take it too fast or you'll end up in a disaster like I did.","July 16, 2015","true","14.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's more of a stat management game than a visual novel. At first there is a lot to do, but then you realize there is nothing else to do but wait for several in-game months for any events to happen. After my first playthrough I had to use the dev console to play all the other routes without the boring RNG management.\n\nThe writing is utterly bland. The game relies too much on tropes and cliches that the endings were predictable. But to my surprise all the endings weren't what I expected, instead they made no sense whatsoever. Like for example, a lifelong sibling rivalry that magically disappears overnight and the protagonist refusing to dump his psychological abuser of a girlfriend, and a lifelong-planned business marriage that was cancelled and the groom totally fine giving the protagonist the girl. The endings felt rushed, unresolved, and unrealistic.\n\nI mean you will probably enjoy this game to an extent, but other than looking at numbers, you'll spend most of your time yelling at the screen telling the main character that he is ret*rded. But you can't do anything because dialogue options are non-existent -- it's just a pre-written story with pictures and numbers.","January 12","false","8.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I experienced some bugs throughout the game that kept me away from processing the story, but thats not much a big deal, Samu-Kun (some developer guy) is up for helping people with issues (mainly on Twitter). [Some info for the bugs I have: it seems that not everyone has those bugs, seemingly no one else, so stay calm ;D ]\n\nI recommend it to most Anime / Visual Novel fans, it's a great balance between story, gameplay and graphic (even though it seems that story is the main focus, depending on difficulty).\n","February 4, 2015","true","48.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As far as visual novels go, it isn't particularily engaging and down right boring at times.  While there is some amusing dialog, much of it is forced, and the author isn't very good at creating characters one can actually like.  The main character is prone to cartoon violence and condescension . . . he pats women on the head, hits thems regularly as if they were one of the Three Stooges, and verbally assaults them with language that may have been thought funny at the time but instead comes across as mean and hateful.\n\nGameplay-wise, the daily management sim is uninspired and soon becomes a chore.\n\nThe art is pretty good with a few oddities.   Those expecting a full-blown eroge will be disappointed.\n\nIf this is dirt cheap and you're a fan of the free Sunrider game, go ahead, otherwise, don't waste your money.","March 31","false","15.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've been reading VNs for over a year now and honestly. this one was a huge let down. I don't even have the motivation to finish it because I haven't become attached to any of the characters. The development is so spaced out and theres so much reptative clicking between segments that it feels like nothing is really happening. If you're into managing stats and a bit of a challenge the game may be for you, but personally I wanted, as the game put, a "simple waifu game", however even on this setting you still have to constantly click and click and click even though the stats mean nothing. Again if you like a stat managing dating sim this game may be for you, but if you're looking for an actual VN, I would recommend against it.\n\nA side note, if you're in it for "those" scenes, they aren't to great either in regards to actual story and the other half you're looking for.","March 1","false","6.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Well in and of itself it works as long as you don't dare to start wondering and check up on some things, though this is exclusevly complaining about the worlds lore if you don't care about that skip on ahead(within this review gameplay stuff is hidden in its depths).\n\nThe prime example is right here:\nThe time System...So if you actually calculate it as "earth" hours rather than "cera" hours it gets somewhat weird...\n\nIn contrast to the "only" 10 hours it would equal 27,7 earth hours, also you need 11,1 (earth)hours of sleep a day.\nI don't know what's wrong with the planet, but these guys must have had some serious mutations going for them if they get 11 hours of sleep and are doing just fine.\nFor real though, ever tried sleeping 11 hours a day for a prolonged period of time?\nThat ♥♥♥♥ is going to kill your biological clock.\n\nBut enough of the rather nitpicky stuff here is the actual potential dealbreaker:\n\nThe Game(play/mechanics) itself\nStat Managements Game with negative stats, lacking explanations for means too gain them, sleep having negative effects on you and even its benefits being lower than taking the dog out for a walk for the same amount of time is indicating a major ♥♥♥♥ up somewhere during the balancing. It'd make logical sense though, I mean the 11hours of sleep taking a toll on your body, the part with doing it nontheless however...\n\n\nOh boy, what a blast!\n\nDid you ever want to find out what it is like to be unable to ever take break? Did you want to experience the misery of caring about the expectations people have for you? If not perfectly reasonable, if you already know of those, well, damn you are pretty tough to still be around.\n\nIt essentially is a spiral of death, along the liens of everything was fine, until...:\n\nSo you start of as a somewhat unique snowflake(elaboration can be found later on) and have to do stuff, and as implied above you got no way out, even being terminally ill is no reason to take a break, you are actually being worked to death if worst comes to worst...this game just got really dark for me...\n\nStill this is how it kinda goes: You, for some arbrietary reason ♥♥♥♥ up a skillcheck, you don't know why or how you could prevent it in the future, you just do (seriously though same task, same stats, 4 failures, 1 succes, more elaboration down below) and now you want to do something about it. Well easy son just buy some ergoe(that's how it goes kids) and lower it. No money you say? Easy just work a bit, what you fail that because of arbrietary reasons and got even more stressed? Well, why don't you just get ♥♥♥♥ed\n\nA blast I say!\n\nHere is my take on it, if you want to go for a stat manager/simulation game, don't leave things up to chance and don't withhold necessary information from the player, some means to indicate the requirements in order to do something succesfully, can't be that far fetched that you'd forget about it, hell even free flash porn games manage that.\n\nAlso the dating part lacks some core elements aswell, such as, and cudos to those who guessed correctly, transparency.\nWell or someone really wanted to promote save scumming(actually just scroling back to the decision, but that's just semantics) in their game.\nAlso some dialouge options are locked behind stats (e.g. 30 fitness for sports as topic).\nA nice example of this is the apparently all serious Ava, now one would assume that talking about things relevant to her would make sense, right?\nSerious people in school care about classes etc., right? So that should totally score with her, right? Nope!\nIt seems weird, as there obviously went alot of work into the game and the writing is pretty good, being both funny and interesting (though up to personal taste, I can't help you with that)\nand yet the core gameplay elements seem to be ♥♥♥♥, and even the waifu mode is still gonna be all in your face about your imminent death, you won't die as bad ends are turned off in that mode, but all those skulls are still intimidating...\n\nWell in order to make this a bit more relateable here is how it essentially works:\nYou got Athletics, Intelligence, Charm and Karma going for you while stress works against you, other than that you    also got money, prestige, homeworks and grades\n\nAthletics: Influence how easily you get sick e.g. with ~15 it takes ~40 stress, with ~30 around ~50\nIntelligence: Rather obviously, for grades\nCharm: Skillchecks of some description dunno which.\nKarma(Luck): The one that usually hits the negative digits, same as charm from my pov.\nHomework: Much like in real life it is absolutely pointless(not even raising your intelligence, I mean come on doing homework usually helps with understanding the topic matter thus making you smarter, right?)\nto do and only stresses you out, but if you don't do it you get in some deep ♥♥♥♥.\nMoney: Buy stuff, usefull stuff even, now if only I could make some...\nPrestige: Bad ends if you don't have, also freeby for the rich kids(much like in real life)\nGrades: Okay, I don't have to explain that one.\nStress: ...much like in real life it ruins your life if you got too much of it...\nBut while I'm on the matter, shouldn't doing stuff that you are supposed to do reduce stress?\nI mean when you finally finish that essay that is due in 2 hours(that's not just me, right?) you are reliefed and not even more stressed out.\n\n!This is not necessarily a complete representation of the stats influences. Rule of Thumb applies, a.k.a. if I play your game and read the texts and still don't know how it works, you done goofed!\n\nAlso explanation on prior to making me pick a set of them would be great.\n\nAt the start of the game you get to pick from 6 sets each 3 focus on one stat in specific(30 on focused, 10 on other two, karma 0) Intellectual also gets -1 homerwork per week, so one more hour and 2~3 less stress per week, good karma(25 luck, 8/5/5 on the other 3), allround(15 on all 3), and rich kid (obv money and swag prestige)\n\nInteresting observation, once I raised all of my stats the failure rate of certain jobs increased as well, guess being overqualified is stressfull and lowers your paycheck on Cera, god I hate Cera...\n\nNow based on this, probably incomplete, information you'd think it should be easy, just focus on not ♥♥♥♥ing up, right?\nDo I even need to say it? Nope!\nBecause even if sick and apparently slowly dieing, you still have to supervise club activities.\nThough the issue could be resolved by just sleeping for the rest of the day, remember kids, that is sleep equal to 16.6 earth hours, that much sleep usually helps if you are really ill.\nWell on cera this approach might be lethal though, for those who paid attention earlier on, don't try the dog there only is more stress waiting...\n\nOr, I dunno, visit a doctor?\n\nCome on future give me some sweet health care, if you already pray to an emperor it can't be worse than what I'd get in Warhammer40k Dark Heresy!\nOh also Space emperor magic seems to be a thing, though the power is (mis)used for waifu purposes, glorious science, gracious science! (The opinion is based on one event and heavily exeggerated, as far as I know space emperor magic is no major plot point)\n\nAlso thanks GabeN for giving me nothing but a tiny ~800x400 window and limited length with no spellcheck, as means to write this...","April 17, 2015","false","11.7"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","12","27","3","0"

The dialogue really doesn't happen that much. Maybe like 2 or 4 dialogs in a month and that really doesn't satisfy me enough. So in conclusion.

When I heard that there was another Sunrider-Game, I bought and played it through. I played some VN up until now, but I guess it was my first time playing a stat management sim, so I wasn't really familiar with it.\nI don't know if it's just my inexperience, but for me there was a lack of help, like how many points in which stats I need to succeed. For example, you have to lead 3 clubs in tournaments, therefore you have to train them and raise their moral, but the game doesn't give you a hint on how much points you need for gold/silver/bronze. I played on the second difficulty, so there was no problem (even for me) and I took the Sola route (best waifu <3). The story was okay, but in my opinion, it was way too long. There were many events at the beginning, but after you played more then half of the game, it was only a click-to-next-day thing. If they somehow made the game shorter, it would be perfect.\nAside from that, I had much fun playing it, there were many hints to the Mask of Arcadius game I enjoyed and enough material to make an otaku like me happy :)\n\nBut you can't go out with your sister though :(","March 25","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No good stress balance over the second difficulty lvl (from 6). No good way of building up the relations (halfrandom smalltalks where you always only press on the topic, she responds with "I like" or "I don't like" and than go your way). I played until the fourth month by now. I'm going to reduce the difficulty on waifu lvl or "baby" as I call it. Maybe than I can have fun.\n\n1. It's not explained what the skillpoints are for.\n\n2. I was on the third difficulty level and stress reduction was a pain in the ***!\n\n3. It's not said when exactly you loose if you don't have a GF to a certain moment (but they don't stop telling me that i will loose if I fail my exams 3 times. Who would have expect that?!).\n\n4. Aparently I can build up a relation but I have no sort of index that shows me how far my relation with a girl is by now. First i thought all events with girls just trigger at some point and that all the smalltalk is completly useless. And thinking so I have to say, makes the game booring cause managing the same things every day is almost acceptable but if you have the impression that the conversations you have sometimes are useless... Oh boy that makes it realy lame.\n\n5. I have no clue if even making other girls happy while you want to date one other, will erase every possibility to go her "path". Not explained either.\n\n6. I mentioned that this game lacks explanation. They explain realy precisely what stress does to you though... Cause you get it by everything. The balance between getting and loosing stress is, in my eyes, not existant.\n\n7. I like the style of the game and for many peoples it makes a lot of fun. I suppose i'm just to stupid for it but it is the JOB of the developpers to explain the game so even dummys like myself can play it without having questions the whole time. Also it takes  so much time to play it that if you want to reload it feels like days (reallife time) you have to replay. I think there are only manual saves so... Yea "for the love of God" think of saving or don't loose!\n\n8. I had much fun time on the second difficulty level until I just lost cause my sister is disapointed about me having no GF. It was not on Agenda though. I lost many weeks cause of that and than I tried to get a relation working. I mean I tried to trigger more relation conversation or whatever I should call them. I just tried for some weeks cause I was than again worrying about my stress (good stuff yo rofl), the fact that i NEVER become new members for the science club (all others were no problems but HOLY **** this science club!!) AND my stupid little sister and her GF plans for me.\n\n9. I can't decide when to trigger conversations. The useful ones. I just wait until they come. I had no problem with that until I lost cause of my sister. Now i want to talk with a girl but I always get smalltalk IF I SEE HER and otherwise I don't even find her at her usual place.","December 5, 2015","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been playing the Sola route at the moment, and there is a serious disconnect between the seriousness of what is happening to her and the events of highschool life.\n\n"GASP! THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER!" then two seconds later "Where am I going to have lunch."\n\nI mean, after a particular turn/event in the game, I thought "First thing when I get a chance, I am going to go to with swimming club to check on her." I mean, surely that'd trigger another event, right?\n\nNope, we literally have a life or death situation, then next time you visit her, it's just plus some stress and plus some swimming team effectiveness.\n\nEven randomly meeting a girl somewhere will net you a choice of unlocked dialog options, all which recieve a canned, sometimes even unrelated response.\n\nThere is a not a lot of meat on this bone, and there is a lot of grind work.\n\nI am enjoying the minimal story that there is, and I still want to play through to completion, but I am really struggling with the idea of recommending or not recommending the game. I guess you could say I wouldn't not recommend it. Maybe it's best if you wait for this game to go on sale if you are thinking about it.

Can you surivie all 10 months while getting good grades, bring glory to your school/clubs, and getting a girlfriend. Yes, yes you can. While it is a fun game to play it lacks content, while I fnd most big budget games lack content (Cough Cough EA Battlefront) , I usually see low budget games try to add as much content as possible. I found myself just constantly skipping through some weeks so bored cause there was little to do. I wish they had added more content in to do in your down time like visit your friends/girlfriend. I also wish that you could have detailed conversations with your friends when you saw them randomly, instead of the same old dry response. It would have also been nice to still see them after 10 affection, because once everyone had 10 affection I never saw anyone other than my sister or when there was an event where there was stuff going on.\n\nDid I enjoy the story yes, It was a nice add on to your story where you lived in a more peaceful time than the events in Sunrider, I enjoyed Ava's story the most, even though its been used before it was nice. Some scences with her made me cry and think about my life and what the purpose of life was, and our goals in life. I was finally glad when Ava warmed up to me and then pushed me away which made me sad, but then Kayto and her got close again. *Spoiler* I love Ava's ending, you rush into her room on graduation day to your despair only to find its empty, so naturally Kayto  thinking Ava has abandoned him,goes on a mission to find her only to find out she was just ordering new stuff. You then precede to hug her and cry (Which was cute) then your wipe those tears away and pretend to be a smooth operator. Then you and Ava finally get married and live in your childhood apartment... with your sister (for no reason) heaven forbid your sister gets out of the house. So overall after all the tears and personality. I was happy with my ending with Ava.\n\nAlso the music is great, gets a 10 outta 10 in my book. It is really nice and fits the mood of every scence, it is peaceful and then dramatic when it needs to be. With so many songs, there is a song for every occasion, and even though if you take too long it will repeat it self, it just sounds so nice you wont care.\n\nSo if you love anime, syfy, romance, and really good music, Buy this game.","December 30, 2015","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy anime girls, easily uncensored games, dating sims and stat management games. This game is for you. I was skeptical at first but after playing the demo, I was hooked. I instantly purchased it (off sale) and do not regret it.\n\nI've hit bad ends a few times and was forced to restart and try different things a few times. I am currently in Sola's arc and haven't done any of the others yet. If you minus the time from my bad ends, I'd say I am roughly 10 hours into game Sola's arc and still 4 months left to go. So if the other girl's arcs are anywhere as long I'd say this game translates to roughly 40-50 hours of gameplay. Shorter if you make a save with all arcs unlocked by following a guide, and lower the difficulty.\n\nI have been playing in original (normal mode) not waifu (god mode). The difficulty options are there for those who like a challenge, and I will be playing in space whale (hardest) difficulty for that last achievement sooner or later.\n\nI do not regret paying full price for this game, and do recommend it. This developer stays true and makes it easy to uncensor if you wish for that. Which I respect, definitely a step in the right direction, towards the fight against censorship.  Also since the first 2 episodes of Sunrider are completely free, it is about time they make some sort of profit.

Can you surivie all 10 months while getting good grades, bring glory to your school/clubs, and getting a girlfriend. Yes, yes you can. While it is a fun game to play it lacks content, while I fnd most big budget games lack content (Cough Cough EA Battlefront) , I usually see low budget games try to add as much content as possible. I found myself just constantly skipping through some weeks so bored cause there was little to do. I wish they had added more content in to do in your down time like visit your friends/girlfriend. I also wish that you could have detailed conversations with your friends when you saw them randomly, instead of the same old dry response. It would have also been nice to still see them after 10 affection, because once everyone had 10 affection I never saw anyone other than my sister or when there was an event where there was stuff going on.\n\nDid I enjoy the story yes, It was a nice add on to your story where you lived in a more peaceful time than the events in Sunrider, I enjoyed Ava's story the most, even though its been used before it was nice. Some scences with her made me cry and think about my life and what the purpose of life was, and our goals in life. I was finally glad when Ava warmed up to me and then pushed me away which made me sad, but then Kayto and her got close again. *Spoiler* I love Ava's ending, you rush into her room on graduation day to your despair only to find its empty, so naturally Kayto  thinking Ava has abandoned him,goes on a mission to find her only to find out she was just ordering new stuff. You then precede to hug her and cry (Which was cute) then your wipe those tears away and pretend to be a smooth operator. Then you and Ava finally get married and live in your childhood apartment... with your sister (for no reason) heaven forbid your sister gets out of the house. So overall after all the tears and personality. I was happy with my ending with Ava.\n\nAlso the music is great, gets a 10 outta 10 in my book. It is really nice and fits the mood of every scence, it is peaceful and then dramatic when it needs to be. With so many songs, there is a song for every occasion, and even though if you take too long it will repeat it self, it just sounds so nice you wont care.\n\nSo if you love anime, syfy, romance, and really good music, Buy this game.","December 30, 2015","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The most obvious thing about Sunrider Academy was that it became one of the most addicting games I have ever played. This was both good and bad because at times it was extremely fun and at other times very tedious and repetitive. I've had games where I loved the game but became frustrated with certain parts, but Sunrider Academy was unique in that despite its problems my attention and admiration towards it never changed. The game created a hugely enjoyable experience which was worthy of the time I invested in it (I spent a great deal of time playing it). It provides a unique blend of visual novel/dating sim with a time management system and requires you to spend your time carefully or risk a “bad ending”. There are 4 routes with 4 different girls which allows for a good amount of replay. As a fan of visual novel games I usually find that most of them are short and give very few things to do besides clicking through dialogue. At its core it is a simple Visual Novel but it adds so much more to the experience and provides beautiful visuals, interesting characters and emotional story telling. I don't like to rate games by each concept of the game but solely by the emotional experience I had with it. If I found my time enjoyable and an positive impression was left after playing then I feel it was a good game. Sunrider Academy did this better then any game has in a while and I would highly recommend.","March 4","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of the girls' plot is similiar to another, the ONLY thing that's the same is the events that have to occur for your main character (tests, club activities, etc).\n\nThe downside, unfortunately, is that this game is sooooo long; and not in a good way. There are 30min periods were you are doing nothing but choosing which club to boost, if you should do homework, or if you should go to a shop/museum in the city. No other plot progression is occuring at that time. I get that they want you to give you enough time to boost up your desired club; but maybe they should have lowered the required stats for continuing a girl's plot and thus lowering the down time of doing literally nothing else but stat crunching.\n\nDespite this, I do recommend this game because it's:\n1) fun\n2) has good art\n3) every single one of the plots is fun and interesting","March 6","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can you surivie all 10 months while getting good grades, bring glory to your school/clubs, and getting a girlfriend. Yes, yes you can. While it is a fun game to play it lacks content, while I fnd most big budget games lack content (Cough Cough EA Battlefront) , I usually see low budget games try to add as much content as possible. I found myself just constantly skipping through some weeks so bored cause there was little to do. I wish they had added more content in to do in your down time like visit your friends/girlfriend. I also wish that you could have detailed conversations with your friends when you saw them randomly, instead of the same old dry response. It would have also been nice to still see them after 10 affection, because once everyone had 10 affection I never saw anyone other than my sister or when there was an event where there was stuff going on.\n\nDid I enjoy the story yes, It was a nice add on to your story where you lived in a more peaceful time than the events in Sunrider, I enjoyed Ava's story the most, even though its been used before it was nice. Some scences with her made me cry and think about my life and what the purpose of life was, and our goals in life. I was finally glad when Ava warmed up to me and then pushed me away which made me sad, but then Kayto and her got close again. *Spoiler* I love Ava's ending, you rush into her room on graduation day to your despair only to find its empty, so naturally Kayto  thinking Ava has abandoned him,goes on a mission to find her only to find out she was just ordering new stuff. You then precede to hug her and cry (Which was cute) then your wipe those tears away and pretend to be a smooth operator. Then you and Ava finally get married and live in your childhood apartment... with your sister (for no reason) heaven forbid your sister gets out of the house. So overall after all the tears and personality. I was happy with my ending with Ava.\n\nAlso the music is great, gets a 10 outta 10 in my book. It is really nice and fits the mood of every scence, it is peaceful and then dramatic when it needs to be. With so many songs, there is a song for every occasion, and even though if you take too long it will repeat it self, it just sounds so nice you wont care.\n\nSo if you love anime, syfy, romance, and really good music, Buy this game.","December 30, 2015","true","32.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I heard that there was another Sunrider-Game, I bought and played it through. I played some VN up until now, but I guess it was my first time playing a stat management sim, so I wasn't really familiar with it.\nI don't know if it's just my inexperience, but for me there was a lack of help, like how many points in which stats I need to succeed. For example, you have to lead 3 clubs in tournaments, therefore you have to train them and raise their moral, but the game doesn't give you a hint on how much points you need for gold/silver/bronze. I played on the second difficulty, so there was no problem (even for me) and I took the Sola route (best waifu <3). The story was okay, but in my opinion, it was way too long. There were many events at the beginning, but after you played more then half of the game, it was only a click-to-next-day thing. If they somehow made the game shorter, it would be perfect.\nAside from that, I had much fun playing it, there were many hints to the Mask of Arcadius game I enjoyed and enough material to make an otaku like me happy :)\n\nBut you can't go out with your sister though :(","March 25","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RavenTsun/recommended/340730/","RavenTsun","RavenTsun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RavenTsun/","203 products in account","Sunrider Academy is a little spin-off, skill-building, slice-of-life romance visual novel of the Sunrider franchise- and an excellent one at that. While still a visual novel, this game is of the vein that focuses on skill building and has set objectives that you must fulfill in order to avoid a BAD END.\n\nThe mechanics are quite well implemented, with the central challenge revolving around having to manage three "problem" clubs at the school. Your job is to ensure they have enough members and perform well enough to avoid being shut down, which would result in a BAD END. This responsiblity, along with having to increase your own skills, study, do homework, interact with the girls, and make money certainly adds a sense of challenge and time management to the game that fits quite well.\n\nThere are multiple difficulty modes that directly affect how your interactions will fair when compared to your skill levels; "Waifu Mode" which allows you to breeze through the game stress-free, without very much risk of getting a BAD END or failing interactions, all the way up to "Space Whale" mode for the true time management test. A full inventory and gifting system, along with CG and BGM viewing is also present.\n\nI'm a big fan of the art design in the Sunrider series, and Sunrider Academy showcases both the background and character art in quite a beautiful way. It is clear that this game's visual novel engine is far superior to the original Sunrider's. The menus and text tracking are smooth and fluent, and work quite well with the skill building system in place. The music seems to be original compositions, and beautiful ones at that. It is certainly a huge jump from the royalty-free music that was present in the original Sunrider game.\n\nAs a side note, I really enjoyed all the silly achievements they added!\n\nI won't spoil the story at all, but I can say with great confidence that both the romance and story content, though not canon to the Sunrider universe (To my knowledge), is very good and certainly an enjoyable experience. Having four different arcs pertaining to who are undoubtedly the series' main female characters, and each with their own unique personality is always a good thing. As to be expected, there are also plenty of references back to the original Sunrider along with external anime and Japanese pop culture references- a touch I found quite entertaining. As a last note, I would highly recommend downloading the Sunrider Academy Restoration mod from Love in Space's website for the optimal experience. (Please note that this mod adds nudity and sexual content.)\n\nI can only find a few minor technical issues with this game. The main one revolves around the ability to scroll back and re-read text or change a chosen decision. If a scene ends, and you are moved to the map screen after dialogue, you can no longer go back to that previous scene. Though not a major issue, and easily circumvented by using a previous save or an auto-save, it can be an issue at times. The only other issue I could find was a slight bit of slowdown present when using the Steam in-game overlay. Sunrider Academy itself doesn't use much resources, but the overlay seems to have a great deal of delay present. This may just be an issue on my system, however. Also, the addition of Steam Cloud saving would be quite useful.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Sunrider series and its characters, you will no doubt enjoy this fun little spin-off romance visual novel. It's easily worth the asking price, and seems to have quite a large amount of content in it. On top of that, this game also has great replay value, as there are different routes and endings for each of the girls along with neutral endings, and bad endings. A completist would get days of gameplay doing all the different endings and getting all the achievements.","February 4","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, if you like stat-management, and games that you don't mind checking forrums for some of the required events, than you should try getting it.\n\nThe story telling is interesting. Yes, it is a sci-fi game. Yes, it takes alot of pages out of anime. Yes, it does have constant references to BL. But if this turns you off this game, you're missing alot out. The characters are pure, they seem generic, but have their quirks to them. And they actually kept me interested, which I can't say about alot of stories.

But it is nice.

Granted the game has issues, but it's totally worth trying out. After playing the first path I think I'm inclined to play again despite the grinding.\n\nGrinding is really ridiculous in this game. So much so it felt for weeks on end (especially after you choose your arc) needless. Granted the arc (Sora) was worth the time, I really wish there was a faster way to getting through the grinding and back to the story. The fact that once you choose an arc you pretty much don't see the remainder of the cast is pretty disappointing.\n\nOverall it's a pretty straightforward dating sim. It was an enjoyable trip and puts my depressing high school experience to shame. Decent art (wish it was a little more like Nekopara but I'm knitpicking), music was pretty good. Overall I had fun.\n\nIf you can deal with the weeks of grinding, barebones dialogue options and Maray's nagging I think you'll be surprised.","June 2","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
