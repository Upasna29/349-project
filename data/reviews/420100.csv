CLANNAD Side Stories is known as ＣＬＡＮＮＡＤ -クラナド- 光見守る坂道で in Japanese. It is originally released on PlayStation®Portable in 2010, it combined the text of the respective novel published in 2005 and audio from the drama CD’s published in 2007. Each story centers around a specific character from CLANNAD, from Nagisa to Yoshino, even including Kyou’s pet, Botan. [Botan is pretty cute but not my favorite of the bunch] Each short story adds rewarding depth to the world of CLANNAD and its cast. A small note before I proceed this review will be slightly different from the other reviews as there will not be any score given. Relavent links can be found at the bottom of this review.\n\nDelve further into the world of CLANNAD and experience the stories beyond the original visual novel, there is a total of 16 side stories each lasting around 30 minutes that allows you to explore and experience new sides and twists to your favorite characters the whole game takes around 8 – 10 hours for full completion. I will be honest here, I did like that it’s a sound novel and the player cannot control the speed of the text and is forced to listen to the whole voice lines till the end. I read at an average speed but still I managed to finish reading the lines way before the voice lines stopped so that is just a small downside to it. But still an enjoyable experience as you can get to see more of CLANNAD characters from different perspective and situations.\n\nFrom 16 stories that it has to offer. My favorite of the bunch is provably story 15 “Together in a public bath”. This story in particular has humor and sad moments, though the sad moments are fake because of a misunderstanding which was very funny because of the build up which leads to a series of events. Like Youhei Sunohara washing Akio Furukawa back at the public bath because he thought he was going to die and wants to spend his final moments with them. [Well that is what they thought] I could only imagine Youhei Sunohara embarrassment after he realize he looked like a total complete idiot.\n\nTo Sum UpWill I recommend CLANNAD Side Stories? Simple answer is yes. But I would highly suggest you to read through CLANNAD first so that you would get the rough idea of each character and you will get to know what are their connections they have with each other. Overall an enjoyable experience not to mention it is enhanced with beautiful illustrations by GotoP.\n\nClick here for review with images and more![azusantiara.com]","June 5","true","14.2"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","43","44","6","1"

Each chapter is a cozy anime episode-sized short featuring one of the characters of the series, ranging in appeal from cute or funny to inspiring or exciting. Some provide untold backstories of characters, while others give insight into their potential futures. CLANNAD Side Stories is by no means a must-read, but if you loved the characters of CLANNAD and what to see more of them, then this title is sure to scratch that itch.\n\nAkio's still the best btw.\n\nSee my full preview here: http://kazamatsuri.org/clannad-hikari-mimamoru-sakamichi-de-sneak-peak/","June 2","true","11.2"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","41","48","3","1"

And, uh, a tiny pig.\n\nHowever, despite it being targeted at people who aren't me, I still found it was well-written, and there's a few stories that particularly jump out at me even now, several months later:\n\n05 (Tomoyo Sakagami - Me in those days): This involves a lot more heroic combat than I thought CLANNAD was about.\n07 (Botan - Various smells): This story, told from the perspective of an adopted pet pig, is incredibly adorable. The fact that I didn't know the characters did not detract from this at all, because small adorable animals are universal.\n08 (Akio Furukawa - A special night): One of the two stories that I really enjoyed, despite not knowing the characters going into this. It's about Nagisa's dad going out of his way to take care of a lost child on Christmas Eve.\n12 (Misae Sagara - The memory between the two of us): The other story that I really enjoyed. It's about Misae and Yusuke in high school. Yusuke kind of reminded me of Nekki Basara from Macross 7, which may have been why I enjoyed this one so much.\n\nThe only real problem I had with it is that the controls are terrible. Normally this would be an odd thing to bring up with a visual novel, but CLANNAD Side Stories is an adaptation of two drama CDs, so there's no ability to speed up or slow down the playback, only pause and skipping to one of five "chapters" for each of the sixteen stories. This is an understandable choice in that they were, as I understand it, designed to fit audio that was recorded three years before the original version of the game was created, including both background music and sounds, but it still makes it awkward if you read particularly quickly (as I do) or slowly, especially as opening the pause menu also removes the text from the screen.\n\nSo yeah, while I can't really speak to the experiences of a CLANNAD fan, seeing as I know almost nothing about the series, I still found parts of this an enjoyable read and think it would be significantly more enjoyable to someone who was already into the series. If you aren't a CLANNAD fan, I would not recommend this as your first entry into the series, however. I definitely had to look the characters up on Wikipedia a few times to understand some of the stories.","June 2","true","9.5"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","29","37","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ALlEN_KlNG/recommended/420100/","ALlEN_KlNG","Alien King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ALlEN_KlNG/","221 products in account","So I sign into steam and much to my surprise I see Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de (Clannad Side Stories) on the store page, and after a brief moment of incomparable excitement and a small amount of time to recompose myself I bought the game, now if you have seen my original review of Clannad you will most likely know I have a great deal of passion for this subject matter.....\n\nso I guess I'll preface this review the same way I did with the original Clannad VN, and this is by saying I maybe a tad bit bias in this as I absolutely love Clannad, I have the Manga, the Blurays, the 10th anniversary art book, so yeah just keep that in mind while reading this review, and try to forgive me ;)\n\nWell to start out I must say that Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de is very different from Clannad as unlike Clannad this is not an arc-choice based Visual Novel rather it is a collection of 16 short stories based around the characters both main and side from Clannad.\n\nThe game is not so much a side story serving more as a series of prequel / after stories; for Nagisa-chan, Fu-chan, Kyou-chan, Ryou-chan, Tomoyo-chan, Mei-chan, Botan and Akio-san just to name a few.\n\nAnyway let’s talk about the game system: it’s very distant from what Im used to when it comes to visual novels. It has a forced auto reader with no real way that Ive found to configure the speed which is rather bothersome.\n\nI have also not found a way to advance the story faster, or to go back to parts I might have missed; you can however jump between chapters which is very useful for going back to parts that you like and love rereading over and over *cough* Kyou-chan *cough*\n\n(>_>)\n(<_<)\n\n….....anyway there is also an option to check out all the CG's, which I believe is a must have in any visual novel, however the only downside I must say is that Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de does not have as many CG's as I would have like but this is mearly me nit picking as it is a easily overlooked thing.\n\nLength wise each story isnt very long clocking in at aproximatly 25 - 30 min give or take so yes they are not terribly long however you can not hold this against it because-\n\nA. they don't need to be any longer; they tell their story well in the period of time needed, any longer and the feel would be completely off, as if to make it worse by drawing it out.\n\nB. Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de was originally a PSP release so they could only do so much.\n\nAnd finally C. there are 16 beautifully written stories so the fact that each story is only around 25 - 30 min is quickly forgotten.\n\nNow onto the stories themselves, as I have said previously in my honest opinion I belive that each and ever story is beautifully written, unlike other VN short story collections, Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de is not just a collection of entertaining but ultimatly irrelevant stories.\n\nThe stories in Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de are definite additions to the character backgrounds and the history of Clannad itself, this helps build on the already well established origin stories of the characters that I had come to love.\n\nThe stories are at times fun, but also there are times that are touching, moving and sad, they shed light on intruiging aspects of the past and future of the various characters: how Kyou-chan and Ryou-chan fell for Tomoya-kun, how Akio-san and Sanae-san met, etc...etc...\n\nClannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de doesnt have to much CG as I said before but that is made up for with it being fully narrated and I mean every character, even Tomoya-kun....however much to my annoyance Tomoya-kun doesnt seem to be voiced by the same voice actor as the anime (while the original Clannad VN was fully narrated Tomoya-kun was not voiced)\n\nMusic wise Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de is the same as the original Clannad, so it’s pretty good; actually now I think about it Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de reused a lot of assests from the original VN.\n\nIm not saying there isnt any original content but a lot of the scenes and music are from the original but that is to be exspected really if you take into consideration that they where making this for the PSP and they had the assests avalible to them so why not use them.\n\nOverall Id have to say that Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de is truly a worthwhile addition to the Clannad world; and my recommendation is to check it out, as someone who has completed the Clannad NV more times than Id care to say this was something that gave me a  more indepth look at the characterrs I love so much.\n\nI hope that this review has helped you in your decision in getting this VN and I hope you will enjoy the whole experience as much as I have, Clannad is my favorite subject and I could go on for hours about it; the Clannad anime is my favorite anime of all time, if you are so inclined I'd recommend you go check that out too.\n\nHappy reading :3\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","June 6","true","42.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"
