"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/63380/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Given how frequently new instalments in the Call of Duty and Battlefield series are churned out, there's a risk that the gaming world will soon grow tired of the military shooter. As enjoyable as these titles can be, some are starting to feel the genre is growing stale. Sniper Elite V2 is a game that could potentially set that right, offering a refreshingly tactical take on warfare simulation.\n\nRebellion Developments has strived to plant players directly in the shoes of a frontline sniper with this third-person shooter. It's all about moving around in the shadows, creating diversions and calculating the perfect shot down to the finest detail. The game will certainly find favour with those who value realism over arcade action, but it's not for everyone.\n\nSniper Elite V2 is essentially a reimagining of its 2005 predecessor, set within the same time frame, with a different spin on events. The game takes place in a battle-ravaged Berlin in the closing days of World War II, with players controlling a US officer dropped into the city to stop the Russians from poaching the Nazi's top scientists.\n\nThe storyline runs only surface-deep, though newsreel-style cut scenes and effective voice acting help capture the Zeitgeist of war-torn Europe. In-game backdrops aren't too shabby either. Those rubble-strewn streets and burnt out buildings look glorious at the higher resolutions, and are functional environments where gameplay is concerned.\n\nMissions see players venture behind enemy lines on their lonesome, with only their wits and arsenal as allies. It starts out stealthy and tense as you creep by enemy patrols in search of a suitable vantage point to pick off your target from. Infiltration is a delicate game, and once your sniper's cover is blown, you're unlikely to last very long.\n\nA submachine gun, a silenced pistol and a trusty sniper rifle are the tools of your trade, although other weapons can be picked up later on. There's also a range of explosives on offer that must be used tactically if you want to get out of war-torn Berlin alive. Trip mines can be affixed to the threshold of a doorway to cover your escape, while proximity mines are useful for booby trapping enemy corpses.\n\nEvery step you take and every bullet you fire must be carefully calculated in Sniper Elite V2. If you're not fleeing from the scene of an assassination, you'll either be crouch-walking or crawling along the ground since loud footsteps give away your position. This will certainly make the game a no-go for those who prefer swifter-paced action affairs, but as far as the stealth fans are concerned, it's an authentic experience.\n\nFiring stray shots from cover to create a diversion usually pays dividends, as do shrewd takedowns with a silenced pistol bullet. The idea is to come and go like the wind, never giving away your location.\n\nInfiltration is an integral part of the game, but the assassination set pieces are the meat of the experience. Finding the perfect spot to take aim from is only half the battle. There are a lot of variables to take into account when pulling off the perfect shot, such as distance, wind resistance, and even your rate of exhalation.\n\nPulling off an effective kill gives rise to an immense feeling of satisfaction, heightened by the bullet-cam depiction of your handiwork, which shows your target's internal organs being ruptured via an x-ray effect.\n\nWhile these segments show off Sniper Elite V2 at its very best, they also highlight one of its biggest drawbacks. While enemy AI can be lethal if you blow your cover, its movement patterns and behaviour are thoroughly predictable. Picking them off from a safe distance is not unlike shooting fish in a barrel. Even on the higher difficulty settings where guard patrols will come at you in force, their attack strategy is enough to make one of Darth Vader's stormtroopers blush.\n\nThe solo campaign offers around 10 hours of gameplay, and can be played co-operatively online to pad it out further. A selection of multiplayer modes provides further mileage, along with some unique twists on the military shooter formula. Overwatch mode is the standout offering, casting one player in the role of a sniper providing support for a ground level companion as they complete a range of objectives.\n\nIn closing, Sniper Elite V2 does a lot of things right. The tactical components have been well thought out, despite predictable enemy AI upsetting the balance somewhat. Minor issues aside, headshot enthusiasts and stealth fans will find much to love here.","April 12, 2014","true","245.6"," 265 of 310 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","265","310","0","0"

The game takes into account bullet drop, wind, stance (whether you are crouching, laying down or standing), breath and motion.\n-The game lets you tackle a level the way you want to. You are only given a waypoint and how you reach that waypoint is up to you.\n-The levels are fairly open. Most levels have several big “arenas” connected by corridors.\n-The A.I can be quite challenging...\n\nCons\n-The A.I can also be very dumb at times. I saw a couple of times enemies just giving up and resuming their normal route right after they had spotted me or I had killed someone next to them\n-Some minor bugs\n-At times the enemy can spot you behind cover or behind boxes which can be frustrating when you have successfully sneaked past several enemies.\n\nNeutral\n-Rebellion has been updating the game with “advertising” for their other Sniper Elite games. Now at the start of the game there is a launcher that is just one advert for their newer game and when closing the game there is another advert that you have to manually quit.\n\n\nI found Sniper Elite V2 to be quite an enjoyable experience. The gameplay is good and can accommodate any type of player (whether you run and gun, use stealth or anything in between), the story while not being anything remarkable is enjoyable and the mission structure is good enough to keep you playing. Sniper Elite is a fun game and an easy one to recommend.","February 14, 2015","true","9.1"," 90 of 97 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","90","97","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/63380/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","508 products in account","The game is unlike anything else on the market, it is becoming and will become a cult classic just like I predicted when I reviewed this game a few days after the release (the Nazi Zombie expansion packs attest to that)  There are only three major negatives about this game that I can think of:\n\n1) It is not as immersive and complex as the first game;\n2) The enemy AI could be improved, but its not terrible;\n3) The game could be harder.\n\nI've been playing this game practically non-stop since it came out.\n\nThere are certainly some trade-offs for the negatives. The graphics have been improved over the first game, obviously. The Asura engine is now one of my favorite engines, it shined in Aliens Vs. Predator and it's pretty good here. Except I don't understand why the last AVP game had Directx 11 support and this game doesn't. That is kind of inconsistent on the part of Rebellion. The bullet ballistics are still pretty good although they have been made easier since the first game. After a pretty fast learning curve you will be able to snipe targets away pretty easily. So I do kind of wish that it could be harder to snipe targets, for the better kill satisfaction. The graphics are pretty decent, I just with the anti-aliasing applied to every jaggy out there.\n\nThe X-ray slow-mo camera. You can shoot your enemy's gonads off, you can shoot their jaw off, you can destroy their rib cages, their kidneys, their heart, their lungs, their eyes. The skull can also be destroyed in many ways even when the enemy is wearing a helmet. You just never get tired of it. I am frankly surprised that other shooting games haven't attempted this before and it is 2012!\n\nThe physics of the game are pretty good. There is plenty of destruction to go around. What I also loved is that if you make your character sit and then start slowly rotating the camera view either left or right, you will actually see your character chance stance by turning the torso and moving the legs. It just FEELS that you are controlling someone. Compare that with Skyrim's third person view. When you do the same thing in that game, your character will just start levitating in air without shuffling legs or changing the body position.\n\nThe bullet ballistics are good but can get predictable. If you miss your first shot from afar, you can immediately adjust your aim to shoot either slightly to the left or to the right, depending on where the last bullet hit.\n\nThe online co-op campaign, something that is missing in so many games, thanks for not having an emblem for that, gamespot. My buddy and I spent hours carefully going through the 11 NON-RECYCLED AND VARIOUS missions. Not only that, there is a horde mode, or the Kill Tally mode, (only 2 players), with 10 waves and an increasing amount of enemies plus enemy trucks, jeeps, halftracks and tiger tanks (last wave only). There are 3 maps for that, each with plenty of locations to hide and hold your ground. You can plant trip wires, mines, dynamite. You can also self ignite enemy vehicles by shooting their fuel tank. You can also kill two or three enemies at a time with one bullet and even kill them with ricochet when they are hiding. There is also a bombing run mode, where you and your partner attempt to collect auto parts for fixing a vehicle and extracting. It is much harder than Kill Tally. There is also an overwatch mode (3 maps only) wherein you and your partner can either play as a sniper or the attacker conducting the ground assault. Finally, there is team deathmatch, with 2 new additional maps that were just added by Rebellion a couple of days ago.\n\nThe story is okaish but damn is it made up, straight out of Inglorious Basterds. You are an American (of course) sniper in Berlin in April 1945 (yeah right), killing Germans and....Russians (with American bullets, ooookay), who is supposed to stop the Russian launch of captured V-2 rockets with poisonous gas on London as a prelude for the Cold War. It's preposterous if you have any respect for history.\n\nThere is a lack of stealth in the game. I mean you could do it in about half the missions but it's more fun just shooting ze Germans and ze Russkies. Whenever you decide to go stealth, make sure to snipe targets during a loud sound as to not alert nearby enemies. You can also search your slain enemies for the ammo and supplies. You can also pick them up and hide them. As you progress, you find new weapons that you can later use in multiplayer but there aren't that many of them.\n\nThe sound is good. There are distant explosions in the background, there are low and high altitude planes flying. There isn't a single civilian in the entire game though.\n\nThe enemies could use some work. They aren't terrible though. They shoot, they take cover, they change positions, they zigzag, they throw grenades, they pick up and treat their fallen comrades. The snipe from afar and CHANGE THEIR SNIPING POSITIONS. The only real thing that I would have liked is for them to stick to their cover for longer times if they are being shot at by the sniper. The slowing down of time is neat, but it makes the game super easy. That technique is meant for the controller, since you can't aim as well with the two sticks.\n\nFinally, this is a great game if you are looking for something fresh. I can only hope that Rebellion adds a map editor. There are just so many scenarios to invent here.  The game is somewhat innovative, fun and pretty solid.\n\nAll in all, awesome game. Go ahead and support Rebellion. They have redeemed themselves after AVP.","November 27, 2013","true","36.3"," 135 of 169 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","135","169","0","4"

It tries to have it's cake and eat it too, and suffers greatly due to it. It's part stealth, part action and long range focused. Problem is, there is no good way of planning attacks, the gameplay is linear and the sheer number of enemies makes this game in a much poorer condition than it could have been in.\n\nThe offset is pretty good. There aren't alot of games that focuses on the role of the sniper/marksman out there, and so far nobody has really suceded in recreating that aspect of combat. The game tries to come off as realistic, having it's balistic model as one of it's most adverticed selling points. And to some extent, the bullet physics are great, exept bullets can't penetrate anything, even a wooden fence can stop these bullets. Only thing it actually does penetrate are foilage and bodyparts... the latter it doess rather well.\n\nThe levels of the game does not invite the player to plan their attacks, as I stated earlier. In addition, there is far to much focus on close quarters combat for this to really take the art of sniping seriously. Snipers and marksmen are mainly covert operators, and they are usually only used for high value target and recon, not as the one man army portrayed in this game. The gameplay is repetative, unintuitive and plain booring in the long run, and it's far from as interesting as it could have been.\n\nIt does, however, provide some entertainment if you have nothing else to do for 30 minutes, but as a game to sit down and enjoy for an evening, it doesn't serve at all.\n\nHope that you'll find this review helpful, comments are welcome.","April 28, 2014","false","6.2"," 285 of 420 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","285","420","0","15"

You should have done so too. This isn't entirely realistic, but it's one of those games which strikes a balance between realism and fun. It's challenging too. The story, however, is not very engaging. You are an OSS agent in WWII trying to assassinate German scientists before the Russians can get them, so not only will you fight German soldiers, but also Soviet soldiers. And there's was a lot of room to make a decent story; you are a secret agent carrying out missions that "never happened" after all. But anyway, on the the gameplay itself. As said already, it's great. Since you are a sniper, close combat is discouraged, and even though you have an SMG, it has limited ammo. For the best experience, I recommend you set the enemy skill to "Veteran", realism to "limited", and tactical assistance "off". Lower settings to me make the game too easy. That said, you have to praise Rebellion for making customizable difficulties. And the main feature of the game: the X-ray cam. It show just what a sniper bullet can do to your body. Can be quite satisfying, especially when fighting difficult enemies. This is cinematics done right. Fortunately, if you are squeamish, you can turn it off. Also, never underestimate a single foe: he can kill you easily. Speaking of the enemies, while they can pose a challenge, the AI could use some improving. This is evident when you see German and Soviet soldiers fighting each other; they will have no problem trying to kill you, but they seem to not cope well when fighting each other. The campaign has a decent length: 8-10 hours. And a second play-through is worth it. Multiplayer is quite fun too, you are all snipers. Element of surprise and awareness play an even bigger role here.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Yes. But you should have got it when it was free. Right now, it's $30, and I don't think that's a good price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabrocccky/recommended/63380/","gabrocccky","Digger Nick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gabrocccky/","82 products in account","I really wish I could recommend Sniper Elite V2... but I just can't. Which is weird because it's a game I enjoyed playing a lot.\n\nLet's start with the good things. Like many said before me, the sniping mechanics are incredibly well done. Sure, some would argue that you shouldn't have to adjust your scopes for a 100m shot, but the maps are relatively small, so it's kind of necessary to have such a drastic bullet drop in this game. It makes the gameplay more challenging and definitely more fun... and that's just the ballistics. The bullet cam and the X-ray vision are what make this game very unique. I don't think I've ever enjoyed sniping so much before.\nBUT\nThese surprisingly fun sniper-sections of the game aren't worth the 20€ you'd be spending on it. (Thank god I got it for free...) Why, you may ask? Because not only the campaign lasts only like 6 hours at most (played on the highest difficulty, which is the only way I would recommend playing this game), only half of it will be spent sniping like that. Which should be okay since you don't want to get bored, obviously. Variety is important you may say, but sniping is literally the only thing they got right in this game... and after an hour of gameplay, you're gonna wish you could just snipe from your safe vantage point again, instead of attempting to sneak through an army of enemies, then inevitably fail.\nYou may have guessed by now that this game is supposed to be a stealth-based one. A mixture of sneaking your way through to the objective, then assasinate X and hunt the rest of the enemies nearby. That's how it should work.\nGuess what: it doesn't. Most of the time you're given a very linear map which is almost completely impossible to sneak through. There are other times where no matter how good you are, you literally can't be stealthy: as soon as you arrive to a checkpoint, you trigger waves of enemies coming at you, no matter how sneaky you are. Then you're left there alone, against hundreds(!) of commies or Jerries with your trusted sniper rifle... and nothing else, since your SMG is ♥♥♥♥-weak and carries up to 2 magazines at once, and your pistol is either used for stealth play (which is either useless or non-existent most of the time), or you could grab a Colt and attempt to benefit from the power of the .45ACP round and its rate of fire. Good luck with that.\nSo the game forces you to snipe even in a CQB situation, which is absolutely ridiculous. You better grab your Gewehr 43.\nEven when stealth play is given, you'll just find it faster, more effective and more fun to shoot your way through the enemies anyway. The other features of the game (setting up traps for your enemy, using distraction, the controls, storyline, co-op and multiplayer) are either laughably bad or just plain useless.\n\nTL;DR: Fun sniping, bad everything else. Worth it if it's free, not worth it if you have to pay for it.\n5/10 for the amazing sniping parts","June 9, 2014","false","13.3"," 56 of 76 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","56","76","0","4"

I'm very dissapointed, if I could recommend an update it would be to have a target on all the nazis ♥♥♥♥ hole area so I could get the moneys worth out of this game. Sure, I got to shoot down a nuclear missle mid air, blow up a few bridges and infiltrate germany, but the epitome of my adventure was when I shot poor nazi gaurd #95839 in the left scrotum. I was so intriegued by the realism of the outfits of the soldiers that I too, went out and bought a replica mosen nagart, vintage nazi uniforms, an ushanka and shot my self in the left scrotom. My wife says I'm way into this and I need help, but I shot her in the scrotum too and it must have worked because she's not moving, so she's either really good at roleplaying dead nazis, or she's dead. And no, I'm not married to caitlyn jenner.\n\nThe only con in this game is that I was not able to shoot any japaneese soldiers. You know what I always wondered? Why the hell did they make Kamakazi Pilots wear helmets? I found the game pretty easy, which is why I believe adding Japaneese soldiers to this game would have made it quite a challange to shoot in the scrotom seeing as they have small uh, planes...............\n\nI ran around the game trying to shoot nazi soldiers in the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥ hole for 4 hours straight. I didn't collect any of the gold bars, nor did I even bother writing in anne frank's diary. I enjoyed this game more than I did watching grandad yell at the germans across the street. We invited the germans over for dinner one time, my granddad kept farting and saying "this is for killing corporal johnny with your mustard gas."\n\nI let granddad play this game to try to relive his past and he hid under the table the broom screaming "IM NOT LETTING THOSE DAMN FRANKFURTS STEAL MY VIRGINITY."\n\nIt was at that moment that I realized my grandfather wasn't even in the second world war. How could I let that pass by me? This man infront of me, he wasn't even my grandfather. I had let in some homeless dude walk into my parents house, ♥♥♥♥ on the germans and go on my gaming computer while screaming at me. Did I even have a grandfather? My grandfather lived in Europe, yes, but he lived in Switzerland.\n\nHow could the game developers make such a realistic game that it could remind this homeless man who refuses to leave about the great war? There were no coloured photos back then, so how could they get the colour so right?\n\nI realized that there were two possible conclusions now. Either the quantum theory of the movement of time is so true that World War Two occured yesterday, where time itself is technically a 'dimension' we experience while awake, and it's only be virtue of the clocks we keep, that we measure the time we sleep. I have heard the universe has a 'pulse', or 'oscillation sotospeak. It is possible that scientists, have used that as a tool for measuring the physical changes that take place in the universe.\n\nor\n\n...\n\nHitler was behind the creation of the game.\n\nIn World War 2, the Japaneese would fly planes into buildings, aircraft carriers etc. etc. but wait, the Japaneese were not portrayed at all in this game. Neither were the British. The only factions portrayed in this game were the Germans, Russians, and the Americans.\n\nLet's take a look at what this really means. The Japaneese were famous for flying planes into buildings, aircraft carriers etc.. You know what other orginization was popular for flying a plane into a building?\n\nAl-Qaeda. But we're not done yet. Al-Qaeda was started in offices and mosques in britain in 1980. (It's true, look it up.)\n\nThe developer studio and its personal developers are from Britain. Could there be an allignment here?\n\nCould the Japaneese and the British Government cooperate to try to deminish their role from World War 2 Alltogether?\n\nBut why would the Brits want to remove their legacy of beating the Germans?\n\n...\n\nA very popular theory is that rich British buisnessmen had funded the uprising of the Nazi army to be able to sell billions of dollars of military equiptment to the British government.\n\n...\n\nThis game's DLC, where you kill hitler, is approximately $8.79 CAD, in USD-conversion at the moment that's  $6.35, so let's stick with that.\n\nHitler was born in April. April is the 6th Month of the year.\n\nBut wait, Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al-Qaeda also died in April. The 6th month of the year.\n\nAre you starting to see a connection here?\n\nLet's take the date of Germany's Surrender (April 28) and compare it to Osama's birth (March 10). How many weekdays are inbetween? 35.\n\nAnother theory is that Hitler didn't actually kill himself, but rather fled to Argentina. Theorists say that it was discovered that the bones of Hitler were actually those of a woman. You might think, "why would the Government lie about that?" Well, let's look at Canada, a direct off shoot of England. The Government of Canada has for 12 years silenced different types of Scientists (including archaeologists and geologists) about their findings should there be any conflict of interest with the Government. (It's true look it up)\n\nWhat makes you think the father won't do any less.\n\nIt's confirmed, this game is created by Hitler, and minions of the evil British banking industry. Other than that, I rate the game 7/10, the game has beautiful campaign but they only last so long, which is pretty upsetti spaghetti.\n\nH-HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE? FBI?!

Rebellion spent waaaaaay too much time comparing their game to Call of Duty (regenerating health, „unexpected plot twists” ending in open battle and killfest, half of game in paid DLC etc.), camera works horribly (I can't imagine playing this on hardest difficulty where you don't have that indicator showing you that AI sees you, most of times I see walls instead of what is actually in front of me) and Welrod has absurd amount of reserve ammo (6/16, compare it to Luger's 8/49), but X-Ray kill cam really pays up for this. And ability to lure AI into traps, it was hardly possible in SE, but in V2 it is pretty easy, but still fun. Kill one guy with Welrod, put a land mine on him, set trip mine in front of him and throw a rock. If hopefully somehow AI won't see you sitting behind cover, then you should see nice „boom”.\n\nThere is also one bad thing about this game: maps seem to be split into some kind of sections, where you can do anything you want and only few NPCs will be alerted – and there is no way shot from Springfield wouldn't be heard in whole facility set up in some kind of freaking cave.

The story gets interesting when you find out one of the officials is actually a traitor who has vital information as to what the Nazis are preparing for in their desperate attempt to turn the tides.\n\nThis game is the epitome of long-range warfare! Sniping enemies has never been more fun! The Ghost Warrior games are nowhere near as exciting as Sniper Elite. The game regularly awards your long-distance, deadly shots with a slow-motion cutscene during which you can see the gory (and glorious) results of your doing. Quite often you get to see how the bones and organs are crushed within the enemies' bodies. Seeing how the heart of an MP40 wielding soldier explodes can be quite disgusting but also quite invigorating!\n\nUnfortunately, while the titular activity in this game is very well carried out everything else in the combat is quite mediocre. Close-combat fight can be quite difficult - it is next to impossible to get a headshot with an MP40 or a Thompson. It is as if the creators deliberately weakened all the other weapons just to force you to use the sniper rifle at all times. Not the mention the amount of bullets you have at your disposal - you will almost never run out of bullets while sniping. I get their point - still, a more refined system could have been put in place.\n\nI heard completing a major part of the game is possible via stealth gameplay - some of the achievements can only be obtained by taking this route. Still, I did not find the insta-kills interesting enough - I had several failed attempts due to the clunky movement of our character. Setting traps is also possible; we have tripmines, landmines and dynamites. Too bad it is quite rarely a must during the roughly 8-hour long campaign.\n\nThose of you who've already read my Nazi Zombie Army reviews must know how much I hate both games. I hate that you have an excellent idea but the execution is just horrible. Connecting to a host took ages and drops from the multiplayer game were frequent. With Sniper Elite V2's campaign I hate them even more as I can now see what levels the creators recycled to get their campaign ready. And now that I've mentioned the DLC titles I can confirm I did not find any cooperative / multiplayer sessions, at all. I expected this, though.\n\nPutting aside the non-existing online gameplay sessions Sniper Elite V2 offers a rather lengthy and great campaign. I do not know what can be more fun than taking out a tank by hitting its fuel tank with a well-aimed shot! This game is THE sniping game.

You should maybe buy it on sale or something. But it's definitely not a full price purchase, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nIt tries do to curious stuff, but fails more often than not. There's some nice verticality to the level design at times, and I like how it discourages close quarter combat by making you vulnerable and letting you carry a pitiful amount of submachine gun ammo. There's also a level where you're caught in a crossfire between the Germans and the Russians, having to fend off waves of soldiers from both sides while you slowly claim ground towards your target. It is The Acest Thing.\n\nAt times, Sniper Elite is an amazing powertrip. I once had three enemies in close proximity - one patroling, and two standing guard. I took one of the static ones out, masking my shot with the ringing of a church bell. While the patroling soldier was examining the body, I took the other surviving guy out in a similar way. As the sole survivor turned around, he found another dead body, having no clue what was happening. I like to think he was pretty bewildered as a speeding bullet entered his skull.\n\nUltimately, I spent a lot of time carefully planning a stealthy infiltration, stealthy assasination and stealthy exfiltration that never was. The checkpoints were too far apart to restart every time I was noticed, and I was noticed far more often than I would've liked. The thing is, I feel like it wasn't really my fault most of the time. The conveniently loud artillery fire would misteriously cease indefinitely as soon as I picked off my first target. Enemy reinforcements would magically appear in places I've already sweeped. Cheap stuff like that.\n\nI had fun for a couple of hours, but I came close to giving up on it several times.","September 23, 2014","true","10.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

I've only been playing this for twenty-some odd hours now, but I really like it. I find myself replaying missions over and over chasing that perfect run, and trying out different tactics. Last night I played a mission pretty cleanly, and didn't get shot once so I got the "Hide and Hope" achievement. It felt like I had actually accomplished something!\n\nThis game has reminded me of how much I like stealth mechanics, and slow, tactical gameplay. Now I've ordered other similar games for my library that I never played for some reason (Hitman series, Splintercell series). In fact, even though I'm less than half way through this campaign (and haven't played any of the coop), I went ahead and got Sniper Elite 3 and its season pass (together for $35, thanks internet!).\n\nThe gameplay is very deliberate, if you like a run-n-gun style, this won't work for you. I really appreciate the tension and atmospherics in this game. Often even when I know I can safely run in a section, I will choose not to just because I hate making so much noise.\n\nYour sniper rifle is your best weapon. Your secondary has very limited range and accuracy, and also limited ammo on the battlefield (though there are strategies to improve this). You have to think like a sniper, don't shoot from a window, shoot from deep within the room, from the shadows (bonus, increased distance points!). Pulling off a perfect mission takes patience and strategy. Pulling it off with style takes experimentation and creativity (I pulled off the final stage of mission 4 using only traps last night). Maneuvering through the maps without ever being spotted is incredibly satisfying, and in some missions, incredibly difficult. Progressing your accuracy from all hits, to all headshots, to all through the eye or through the ear shots (beautifully confirmed by the amazing kill-cam) feels great. Doing that to 3-4 enemies in a row, all in a single breath feels amazing. This is really some kick-♥♥♥ sniping. And you can make it even more kick-♥♥♥ by tweaking the difficulty in a fairly flexible way.\n\nThe in-game collectibles are completely meaningless, getting them all doesn't confer any kind of stat bonus or unlock new equipment, but I still like finding them as it satisfies that inner OCD (especially the bottles).\n\nThe lack of a save system could be seen as a down side. It's checkpoint only. So if you screw something up, you may have to repeat a decent chunk, though they are usually pretty close together once you figure out the optimum pattern for a particular map.","January 11, 2015","true","79.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

But for me, the bad definitely outweighed the good and I often got tired of it or dropped it for a while out of frustration, not at least with the terrible autosave system. If you buy it cheap on sale (personally I got it for free in a short promotion offer on steam), it isn't a waste, but the money could be used so much better and for an older (and short) game it is quite expensive.\n\nThe good:\n\n- Quite good sniper mechanics including wind and bullet drop (meaning that you often have to fire a bit over and to the left of the target to hit it, which is realistic).\n- Kill cam shows you the bullet penetrating your target in x-ray.\n- You can hit grenades in enemy belts and make them explode.\n- Graphics are quite good.\n\nThe bad:\n- The third person looks provide you with a hell of a camera angle, often meaning that you can't see an enemy if he's right in front of you and you are standing close to a wall.\n- No real training possibilities meaning you need to practice shooting on the go. This is a problem in a sniper games as it means that you will newer really master how to hit a far away target precisely where you want to, that is, to calibrate the wind and bullet drop. At least not until you are almost finished with the game anyway.\n- The autosave is very bad and means some place that you might need to play through half an hour of combat again if you die. Also, to me it seems like some places, the enemies kept coming closer and closer every time I restarted at checkpoint giving me very little time to react and therefore dying a lot of times.\n- There is a general lack of genuine good sniping positions. Most positions are of the kind where you would be dead in five minutes in real life. In real life, a good sniping position is NOT sitting behind a small box in the middle of the road, but a place where you can fire without being spotted and then move to another good sniping position before you fire again. This is more or less impossible in this game.\n- While stealth is a possibility, most parts of the game more or less enforce you to chose between rambo or rambo-ligth approaches. A real sniper doesn't stand in one position blasting down 15 enemy soldiers firing in on him or assaulting a compound with a submachine gun killing off 50 soldiers.\n- There should be a more realistic game mode whit less help for when you want a challenge. In this you should be able to set off your own landmines and trip-mines if you don't pay attention to where you put them and there shouldn't be bullet lines to help you spot where people are shooting at you from.\n- The plot is bad and extremely right-wing USA coldwar hawkish. You fight to liberate nazi war criminals as long at they will help the USA build weapons or kill them if they want to do the same for the USSR. You don't assist in winning the war, on the contrary you actually delays the advance of the Red Army thereby prolonging the war and the suffering of both soldiers and civilians in the war zone or living in areas still under nazi control. Actually, you even kills lots of allied soldiers of the red army.\n- There are a few bucks in the game, but when they happen, they are major. Like a wagon full of German soldiers not moving at all while I stand right next to it killing them one by one.\n- There is no real aiming with other weapons than the sniper riffle, no real use of iron-sight but instead a cross point with a large spread of bullets, even at very close range .... like 1 meter.\n- The game is too split up in "zones". Meaning that you can't really lure most enemies away from the small area they start in. It would be cool if you could fire at them, luring them to follow you into a building which you had filled with traps offering you a more realistic way of taking out a lot of enemies and making landmines and the like much much more practical usable in this game.\n\nAlso, the game is quite short, which can be both a good and a bad thing in my opinion.","January 2, 2015","false","18.3"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","40","64","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/portiermaison/recommended/63380/","portiermaison","Bub Clubbem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/portiermaison/","396 products in account","In Sniper Elite V2, you take the role of the worst marksman the collective allied powers could muster who is sent on a high-stakes covert mission by his superiors from within intellegence agencies to destroy progress Nazi superweapons, the V2 Rockets. You know. As a joke. To aid him, you gain access to a wide arsenal of submachineguns that your international assassin can just barely figure out which end is which on, pistols that are all broken and work improperly to some degree and high-power battle rifles with worn-out rifling, thousands and thousands of rounds of reduced power ammunition, and increasingly powerful optics made in the back of a moving truck that are incapable of any adjustment.\n\nCoincidentally, as you undergo your mission, the magnetic field of the earth becomes much more powerful in Europe. Thousands die. This forces the people of Europe to redesign their roadways to only go in straight lines though low-magnetism areas, so there is only one path throughout all of the missions. On top of this added challenge, your projectiles (which are low velocity to avoid radar detection) are being wrestled to the earth, clawing all well-made death machines to an estimation of 3,679 Minute of Angle accuracy. To make up for this handicap, though, your infantry rifles do have anti-tank capabilities and the majority of your opponents are firing at you with fire hoses filled with lead fishing weights.\n\nAs far as the plot goes, it's your normal fare. It's a historic fiction game set between 1939 and 1945 very similar to others such as Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, etc. Now I have a bone to pick. These games all rip eachother off in their writing. Their characters all look the same, even have the same names, the games all take place at the same times in the same places. I mean, compare the main antagonist of this game, Adolf "Fuhrer" Hitler, to that of the Adolf Hitler character in any of the games I mentioned previously. What hacks. They even all have the same moustache. Is it really so hard to come up with your OWN setting? How about you call your war something other than "World War Two"? What about the first one? And why Germany? Why not something like Antagonistia or Detroit for a name? Some of the most uncreative writing I've ever found in a video game. Although, later in the game, I do like the twist where your character is bitten by a radioactive Nazi and gains x-ray vision, which reveals that the Nazis were really skeletons all along. It adds a nice twist to the setting and what I think would have actually happened were this a real war.\n\nI would recommend this game for young readers ages 8 to 12 who are hypoglycemic, get in excess of 40 hours of sleep a day, are multilingual, and have chronic vestigial flight capabilities.","July 9, 2014","true","20.4"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","28","43","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinfinitedoom/recommended/63380/","theinfinitedoom","Gunmetal Buffalo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theinfinitedoom/","559 products in account","This game is a sad waste of potential, just like everything else that comes out of Rebellion. There's a wonderful ballistics model, and the kill-cam is really nice, but the rest of the game is an awful slog. You're given a handful of items, none of which will ever be helpful. Your silenced pistol is too inaccurate to use beyond literally a few in-game feet. If you're hiding outside a doorway and your enemy is on the other side of the room, you've got maybe a 30% chance of hitting his head. You won't want to aim anywhere else, hitting him anywhere else just sets him off. Rocks will trigger enemies, but can distract them for about a half-second. I haven't ever used them because if I'm that close and they don't know I'm there, I'd rather just shoot them with the pistol. I won't touch on the SMG, it's so inaccurate and has so little ammo that they might as well have ignored it. You're better off spamming your rifle, stunlocking with the pistol, or more likely just letting them murder you so that you can restart.\n\nI hear rumors about things known as "stealth" and "flanking", though I've never seen them nor have I ever seen an opportunity for them to manifest. That's not a lack of skill, there's just no other path to take. The first level is within a bombed-out city, which means that there are a handful of buildings you can go in, and everything else is invisible walls and rubble. There is one path winding through the streets, and you have to walk through the open in order to get to the next objective. The first two missions might as well have been on rails for all the freedom you're given. Waypoints and invisible walls push you ever forward, you're never given any reason nor opportunity to place traps on enemies, move bodies you've shot, or otherwise use the level organically. This issue is compounded by the fact that the enemies will spawn in and re-arrange themselves spontaneously depending on your "progress". This means that you'll pretty much never be able to place TNT as traps, you can only trigger them by shooting them. In order to use it as a trap, you'd have to manually place it next to an enemy, then backtrack to a vantage point and trigger the explosives. In lieu of that you could just shoot the enemy from the vantage point and skip the middleman, or sneak up on the enemy and use the silenced pistol. However, the latter option is likely to trigger enemy rearrangements or spontaneous reinforcements as you approach. Enemies are super-eagle-eyed, so you can forget about sneaking around within 100 feet of an enemy unless they're scripted to stare away from you forever until shot. That could change as you get closer, they could spontaneously shift into a patrol route because you passed through an invisible trigger. The awareness indicator is low to the ground, hard to see, and if it's there you've pretty much already tipped them off to your location. This goes double for snipers, who spawn in only when you're about to blindly encounter them, and they are set up so that they will always immediately spot you and engage. If you manage to cheat the detection system through a combination of luck and respawn-based clairvoyance, that still makes them the first target you *have* to shoot in order to progress. On the second level, they're placed so that they can't see you, but that's only so that you can exploit the noise mechanic. The noise mechanic doesn't care about ambient sounds, there's an indicator that pops up when specific events happen (like a train horn), and during that interval you can do *anything* without drawing attention. At all other times, every spawned enemy will hear every shot, and all nearby enemies will track upright footsteps. While enemies are eagle-eyed, they are forgetful. If you're lucky no one has Line of Sight to you and you can wait the minute or so that it takes for all the enemies to assume you've given up and gone home. Be prepared to use and abuse this feature.\n\nMy suggestion is to download the demo. If you enjoyed blowing people's brains out, play the level again. That's the level right after the tutorial, copied entirely. It never gets better than that level right there. The maps are just as restrictive, the enemies spawn/rearrange spontaneously in the same "just to F*ck with you" maner, and the objectives are never more than "go here", "plant the thing" or "shoot the guy". I don't blame you for enjoying the shooting, I certainly did. There's just no reason to purchase the full game. No other part of the experience is worth the investment, if you're only there for the shooting than you might as well stick with the demo that lets you shoot stuff for free. If someone's done a Let's Play of this game from start to finish, you should just watch that and be done with it. You can't play this game any other way, the only variable would be your personal shooting performance. To simulate that, I refer you back to the demo.","April 23, 2014","false","3.0"," 35 of 56 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","35","56","0","1"

Kill cam is "Killer!" but loses it's charm, again, in about 10 minutes.\n\nPlayed this game from the outset on 'sniper elite' difficulty.\n\nThe AI is terrible. This is a mostly, on-rails, linear shooter with terrible AI. Enemy snipers spawn out of no where on several missions and can see you no matter what you do or how sneaky you've been. They will ALWAYS get the first shot off before you. It really takes away from the stealth part of a snipers job and it just feels like a scripted, rollercoaster ride that has you being a sniper who really can't enjoy the skills of that role.\n\nAfter a while of getting killed by super, x-ray vision, spawning snipers, it becomes a game of 'memorizing where they will spawn so you can shoot them' game.\n\nI bought it at a huge discount along with SE v1 and V3.

With nobody standing up to the Aussies, Naomi is quick to act fast and places the entire land in peril. Naomi then finds himself trapped in a world of drugs, money, fame, and power, forcing him to make decisive decisions that will impact him throughout the whole game.\n\nWith this in mind, the player has full control over Naomi through the perk system, skill tree, etc, and, through the RPG based aspect of the game, the player can develop Naomi into a complete versatile weapon of good, or evil - I personally made my first Naomi a level 13 Orc Mage hybrid with an Archer build.\n\nBesides the story, and character, the game also offers immense graphics with minimal invisible walls - I repeat: minimal invisible walls, literally none. This, added with superb AI, offers an action packed game bursting with possibilities! This AI also includes real time situations with real time reactions; enemy soldiers will be able to manoeuvre around obstacles, definitely ensuring 100% that they will not go prone and stare at the obstacle blankly, whilst trying to fathom the meaning of "lyfe".\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone interested in any form of RPG, as the open-world design, with unlimited freedom, truly allows you, and you only, to choose Naomi's destiny...","June 10, 2014","true","9.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","5"

Don Draper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWerepyreKing/","392 products in account","I honestly couldn't get through this game. It's a "stealth" game, but not really. Truly it's an action game and a decent shooter that requires a somewhat logical thought process to get through, but that slowly goes away as you progress.\nThe level design is unclear, enemies are the same throughout the game, and it has the generic storyline and fighting that every WWII video game has. It's alright, but I got it for free and still didn't enjoy it much.\nMy 13 year old brother said this, better than I could have, probably:\n7:42 AM - [REDACTED]: Sniper Elite is the worst game I've ever played\n7:43 AM - [REDACTED]: I don't know how you put up with the gameplay for so long; it tries to be a stealth game and a sniping game but fails at both\n7:44 AM - [REDACTED]: You essentially have to go loud every interaction with enemies because of the level design and the fact it is just easier\n7:44 AM - [REDACTED]: Most of the map design is also really close range so the sniping is out of the question\n7:45 AM - [REDACTED]: It's like it tries to be Hitman but instead of encouraging you to stealth and not kill anyone, it encourages you to kill everyone but do it silently\n7:45 AM - [REDACTED] and even when you ignore all of that it's just flat out not fun\n7:48 AM - [REDACTED]: Every negative review for this game is really detailed, which is really good\n7:49 AM - [REDACTED]: I was hoping that a realistic sniper game would be about long preparations with sudden bursts of violence. The tutorial that teaches the player to lay traps made me hopeful, but then the real maps were just as linear as the tutorial maps. There is no scouting of the location, no finding alternative exits, etc. There is only one road and after you take your sniping shot, the game will tell you when to run and which way to run. This game resembles typical shooters way more than I'd like it.\n\nI'm not an expert on AI, but it takes me out of the game when the enemy is coming towards me in a single line one by one and they don't react when I shoot them one by one. It also breaks the illusion when the level designers intentionally set up a bossfight-esque event when dozens of enemies are aware of me and shooting at me and I have to snipe them all before I can go on. These kind of things shouldn't be orchestrated, but naturally emerge from the gameplay.\n\nAll in all I was very disappoined by this game as a sniper game, especially because this title is such well recognized as a good sniper franchise.\n7:49 AM -[REDACTED]: However, I expected a game where you sneak from sniper position to sniper position and where you have to be careful and think where you go, who you kill, what you do, stuff like that. I did this in the first misson, until I "discovered" that you can just run through the levels and basically noscope anyone in front of you. Soon sneaking through the streets and houses and throwing like a million stones to distract the completely idiotic enemies was something I didnt even think about anymore.. (One ran into a house and got himself stuck by laying down and trying to turn around, stuff like that happend pretty often to me.)\nAt one point i felt like rambo, just with a sniper. In the mission where you have to enter a german V2 Facility I just ran through it and killed everyone with my sniper. Sneaking? Or any gameplay depth? I didn't experience any.\nAlso there was something about a story, but it didn't really matter nor did it make me feel connected to the guy I was playing."","July 23, 2015","false","6.1"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","27","42","0","0"

The game is less of a run and gun shooter and more on stealth. I never did get into any multiplayer gaming and just played the solo campaign (I am not much for multiplay when the game offers an excellent campaign play through).\n\nI was one of the lucky people to get this game when Steam was offering it for free (for a 24 hour period) so I figured I would try the game out. Why not if its free right?\n\nI was impressed with the use of history and how it made for the story line during my first few minutes of play. I liked how the bullet cam worked as well. Taking aim at a very long shot after controlling your breathing then firing your rifle you will see your bullet travel all the way from your barrel to the target.\n\nWhat I was most impressed with was the X-Ray kill cam. At certain moments when you have a shot and fire you get an X-Ray of the target and get to see the skeleton and organs get damaged as the bullet travels through. Its pretty gruesome and for my first time seeing this I was amazed at the effects and coolness of it. I wouldn't say its true to life but well done for a video game.\n\nI didn't notice any issues with the game while playing but I did find that it relied on triggered events. For instance, I get in a building and hang back then use my sniper rifle scope to check the area ahead and don't notice anyone around. I fire a shot and nothing, so I creep up to the doorway and then the enemy's spawn.\n\nSetting yourself up to a vantage spot is very useful. In a solo campaign where you camp at a good spot and peg off anyone around is a good tactical move for playing a sniper in any game or any game mode.\n\nYou do have other tools at your disposal like trip mines. Setting on up in a door way then heading up to the second floor and getting some kill shots off only to hear the trip wire go off makes me smile. Its an easy kill plus a good method to alert you to move to another spot.\n\nThe main campaign story was also good. At the beginning of every mission there was a briefing as to the scenario to play out and what was needed to be done, all of it was voiced.\n\nI played the game with the Xbox 360 controller and Sniper Elite V2 is very friendly for controller support. I can't see myself playing this game with the keyboard and mouse.\n\nI have to admit this game was addicting and I did spend allot of time trying to get the X-Ray kill cam to happen. If it wasn't for that I don't think the game would offer all that much. The bullet cam is cool but its the X-Ray kill cam that really makes the game interesting.\n\nNow I got this game when it was free so I can't really say if its worth the price because when something is free of course its worth the price. However the game is currently $29.99 and although thats not a bad price I would wait till its on sale or the price drops to $9.99. You may also want to wait till the game and the DLC come bundled together for $29.99.

Enemies are not too bad when using Elite difficulty. They will hunt you in teams on ground level and keep going after you as you try to evade them. AI could be better if enemies, once alerted, always kept under cover and went from cover to cover. The game is mostly interesting when played with a friend in coop : 2 players, doing campain together, on Elite difficulty with no aiming help. In coop MP it's ok. You can play it alone, will keep you occupied for 20 to 25 hours. What is missing is a map editor, something where you could load any game map and MP map, put enemies, make patrols, or static surveillance with angle of surveillance (an editor like GRAW did offer would be nice). With such an editor, we could create a lot of maps. Add random spawning of enemies on map when you get spotted, random enemies positions and it would be great.\n\nSince V3 is out now and offers a 4 player coop, I would suggest this game mostly for playing campain with 2 players.\nAlone it's ok but not as fun as in coop.

And I will admit it is very good at that. The sniping in the game is very satisfying and interesting. It's very fun trying to line up a good shot after factoring in the bullet drop and other factors. The slow motion and X-ray effects are great, they make you feel like you're powerful.\n\nUnfortunately, the game tries way too hard to be an action game at the same time. You spend more time sneaking around and shooting than sniping. Stealth plays an important part in the game, but it's done very poorly. There are no ways to easily kill guards silently, and your 'silent' crouch is extraordinarily slow. Simply put, stealth feels very sluggish and forced into the game. I found it a lot more satisfying just to pull out a gun and force my way through the stealth sections.\n\nSpeaking of which, the gunplay in this game is awful. The camera controls don't work very well, and the guns feel completely useless. You feel like you're using a peashooter as the enemies shrug off bullets. No to mention there are way too many of these sections in the game. Why is it called "Sniper Elite" when you're using an SMG or pistol for 50% of the game?\n\nOverall the game is so terribly mediocre in all aspects I find it impossible to recommend. If you're looking for a really good stealth and sniping game, try the first game.

There is just something about watching a bullet explode a man's nut-sack that makes any game that little bit more enjoyable.\n\nThe slick graphics makes you actually feel like you are wading the streets of Berlin. Some excellent visuals throughout the playthrough. I only hit the single player as multiplayer seemed a little dead, so the run was a little short at three and a half hours, but I wasn't too fussed about that as Steam actually released this game for free for a day a couple of weeks back, so hopefully most people will have it already.\n\nStory-wise, it is very much like a pre-cold war setting, so anyone who likes stories set in that era will certainly enjoy following the plot. I on the other hand, was more focused on the gameplay. Being able to snipe through hoards of enemies from your chosen hidden location is so satisfying, you can often take on ten or twenty enemies at the same time, you feel bad-♥♥♥ by the end of it all.\n\nIf you haven't already got the game in your library from the free event a few weeks ago, this is certainly one you should be playing. Sadly it is still fairly expensive at £22,99 so you may be best waiting for it to go on sale","July 20, 2014","true","3.5"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","20","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainstardog/recommended/63380/","captainstardog","Fireballs of the Eucharist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainstardog/","161 products in account","Okay, if your favorite slice of the FPS pie is sniping, you might want to give this a go. I got it for free during a 24 hr Steam giveaway, but after having played it through I'd probably pay at least $10 for it. That's not much of a recommendation, but read on if you want to know why I take this particular stance.\n\nIt's WW2, and you're a sniper working for American interests at the end of the war. The storyline is okay, not superb, but passable. Well, mostly--the ending is a bit much, but no spoilers here. You are fighting against German and Russian troops while attempting to keep V2 rocket technology from falling into Communist hands. Stock World War II characters and situations are prevalent with no memorable bad guys. I played through the entire solo campaign in less than 24 hours, and while certain battles and moments have stayed with me, a lot of it is fading into one long blur of FPS glory.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe sniping can be, at times, truly amazing. The first time you breathe out and squeeze the trigger and watch the slow motion display of the carnage wrought by your well-aimed, well-timed shot, you will feel truly repulsed and rewarded at once. The usual sniping of FPS with either ragdoll physics or the flicking of a light switch effect that seem standard are largely replaced here by visuals that show bullet shattering bone, devastating internal organs, sparking off some metal gear being carried or worn, blowing a large exit wound in the opposite side of your foe, and the realistic tumble of an impacted round. As someone who was trained by the military in forensics and went on to work with one of the largest and most prominent medical examiners in the U.S. (Detroit produces a wealth of experience in forensic and autopsy work), I can say that I was impressed by a lot of what I saw. There are custom settings for different aspects of gameplay, so if one aspect doesn't suit you, you may be able to tinker with it; this includes difficulty of enemies, aiming assistance, and so on. There is a decent amount of variety in the types of objectives, maps, and situations you will encounter, so even though your play through may be somewhat brief, it shouldn't feel too repetitious. When you complete the solo campaign, there are multiplayer, co-op, and challenge modes available to extend replayability as well. What the developers got right, they got very right, and I can easily see myself coming back to this from time to time just to get some target and tactical practice.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe AI is awful. I found myself constructing many elaborate traps only to find I had no way to lure soldiers into them if they were beyond a certain distance. Not in every instance, but in far too many. And once you've set a trap, it's used. No way of retrieving them.You cannot shoot out lights. I find that nearly unforgivable in a game like this. Also, there are bottles set up for target shooting, but apparently they are made of some incredible material because you can't knock over or destroy them from 5 feet away with a handgun. Only sniper rifles can destroy them, which brings unwanted attention of course. Also, the mutant regeneration ability seems out of place, even if it is necessary to the game's mechanics of play. Not saying it is, just saying. And it seems silly, even if satisfying, to be able to destroy all manner of vehicles with a single, well-aimed shot, but not be able to shoot out a lightbulb.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nMultiplayer. Take out the one thing that makes this game worth getting, toss in lackluster maps which, at least in some instances, are clearly imbalanced in favor of one team over the other, and return to everything that is tired and old about WW2 FPS games, and that's the multiplayer I experienced in the three servers I joined. Nothing there to keep me coming back. Oh, and don't forget the players who've memorized the best spots on the best side for each map to absolutely make the play monotonous and frustrating beyond belief. I've played much older games in this genre that did a much better job of it. I have not tried co-op yet (UPDATE: this has changed), and I'm hoping it will offer something more than multiplayer. Oh, and before I go (I edited to add this part), the stealth aspect. It's almost non-existant. There are moments when you can use it, but for a sniping game those moments are far too few. Most of the time you'll feel like Rambo, but with a sniper rifle instead of an M-60. I wish they had made this more of a true stealth game, but alas...\n\nFinal Analysis:\n\nDecent fun for the price, if you catch it free or for cheap. If you like sniping, give it a shot. Just don't expect too much out of this title and it'll be alright. If you have a buddy who likes this game, co-op is alright even if somewhat limited and at times redundant. I like it even with its faults.","June 6, 2014","true","45.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TDAGARIM/recommended/63380/","TDAGARIM","Trai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TDAGARIM/","157 products in account","SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nSniper Elite V2 is a rare breed. A WWII game, but with an emphasis on stealth rather than the usual guns blazing tactic seen in other FPS and TPS war games. You play as Karl Fairburne, an American sniper sent into Berlin during the dying throes of WWII to assassinate German rocket scientists.\n\nThe main feature of the game, the sniping, is pretty damn good. The bullet cam mechanic is one of the most varied I've seen, unrivalled in realistic shooters, and the only one rivalling it in any shooter maybe being Stranglehold's Precision Aim mechanic. However, on higher difficulty levels, the bullet ballistics and wind mechanics can be fiddly at it's worst, but I find it gives you an amazing high when you can calculate the exact place to shoot, slotting a fresh round from a Gewehr 43 into some Nazi's frontal lobe.\n\nSpeaking of which, the guns in this game can be described in one word: beautiful. They stay faithful to the real world counterparts, sharing the names and both the pros and cons, with the Mosin-Nagant's bolt-action reload slowing down your killfest in return for astounding bullet velocity, and the PPSh-41 trading ammo in some places for a higher fire-rate. On lower video qualities, the guns look slightly blocky, but on higher, they look just like the real variants.\n\n-- SPOILERS START HERE --\n\nThe story, although contrived at times, is a nice backdrop to your bloodlust. As Karl Fairburne, you are tasked with eliminating multiple German rocket scientists, although there are many ways the game surprises you with this, including attempting to save one as he defects to the American side. It is revealled that as a last ditch attempt to win the war for the Axis, the Germans and the Russians are planning to use V2 rockets aimed at London and filled with deadly Tabun gas. Eventually you shut down the V2 launch site and assassinate the mastermind.\n\nIf this sounds all a bit gung-ho, that's because it is. Although Sniper Elite V2 is a great stealth game, deep down inside, it wants to be like Battlefield, it wants to be like CoD, it wants to play with the big boys. The story has been altered from the original Sniper Elite back in 2005, to adjust for the changing times. In the original, you have assistance from the German resistance. This has been taken out of V2, as a large section of FPS fans these days prefer a "lone wolf" type story. Some of the in-game areas are a bit too close quarters for what's meant to be a stealthy sniping game, including the Russian HQ in East Berlin, where a large amount of enemies (probably around 20 or so) come screaming at you down a narrow-ish corridor.\n\nHowever, on the majority of the game, it is a bona fide departure from the Modern Warfares and Bad Companies that populate the FPS genre these days. Sniper Elite V2 is a healthy apple in a Happy Meal of double cheeseburgers and McNuggets. Overall, I do recommend this game, and would suggest it to not only the more discerning gamer, but even your average teenager with a 10 second attention span.\n\n9/10 - could have improved in some places, but overall a gem. Pick it up if you see it on sale at any time, or even if you just have spare dosh lying around.","June 7, 2014","true","13.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skatebreeder/recommended/63380/","skatebreeder","Dead Kitty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skatebreeder/","35 products in account","Sniper Elite V2 puts you into the WWII setting in Berlin, 1941. You obviously should play the first game before this, but some of you didn't, which I'm guilty of too. I feel that after playing the first 3 missions of the game, the review was ready to be spit out. I personally like this game, and the reasons so I will say. Now the gameplay is very nice, giving you a challenge the whole way through the mission, which I like. Unlike COD, this game takes the use of your brain and putting it to work. You can't run in throught the mission and shoot, hell no, not in this game. You can easily die running into the mission, which I'm guilty of the first couple times. You can easily be picked off by one or two enemys by running in, but in COD you can take on 10-15, which is insanely absurd. Which is mainly why I don't like COD too much, but the zombies mode and campaign are alright. So, in order to not get killed so much is to have the enemy come to you, you don't come to them because 2-3 shots can kill you right off the bat.\n\nNow to talk about the graphics and the enviroment. The enviroment is great, it gives that vibe to the whole WWII scene, having to do with flying planes, destroyed buildings, tanks, roadblocks, exploded vehicles, you name it, the game has it. The graphics are beautiful, running Sniper Elite on a 1080p resolution and the ultra settings preset made this game look beautiful, which contributed to the game being so good to me personally. But, the water and smoke looks like poop! The water looks like a plastic sheet put over the ground, not to mention that stepping in it had no splashing effect which made the water so lifeless like it wasn't even water. The game developers need to put some physics into the water and smoke, or it'll just make the enviroment seem more lifeless and bland. The smoke from a far distance looks good, but up close it looks like it was made with the Microsoft default Paint program you have in the Start menu. The smoke also has no density to it, making it bland just like the water. Again, the developers should've spent more time on the smoke and water effects. Anyways, I forgive it since the rest of the enviroment looks next-gen with great PC optimization giving a full 60FPS on ultra with this last-gen GeForce GTX 550 Ti Gigabyte OC that I carry in this PC.\n\nNow the background story, which this game doesn't really have any. The backstory to this game makes me say "What"? Now, what I mean is that there's no backstory to this game, as in the cutscenes before each mission for example Grand Theft Auto, Half-Life, and Mafia II have a backstory, which gives it's background that promotes the fuller understanding of the game, although there's a brief saying of the mission you are about to enter in this game. But, still there really isn't a backstory to the game. Now, if you don't understand what a game's "backstory" is, I'd go look up backstory on Google or whatever search engine you use. Anyways, Sniper Elite is still good even though it has its flaws to the game. Every game has its flaws. Like Grand Theft Auto IV, which has sort of a horrible PC optimization to the game.\n\nThe heartbeat system consists of mainly two things, your lung capacity to use focus time, and your health. When your heartrate goes above 80BPM you can't go into focus time, there's two reasons as to why it is over 80BPM. One: You've been shot, which brings up the heartrate, but not necessarily all the time though, there's a few times when I been hit 3 times and it still was at 70BPM. Two: You've have been either jogging or running around, which would always raise your heartrate. So, that's the heartrate system in a nutshell.\n\nHUD elements like your objective and your weapon and ammo will disappear after an amount of about 5 seconds, which can be helpful if you need to see at the corners of your screen. That's a plus in any game.\n\nOverall, the game's nice, the music is good. The gunshots are satisfying when you snipe someone overhead. The overall rating of this game is a good 8.7/10.","June 6, 2014","true","9.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

First of all the AI is extremely poor, I found most soldiers could be baited and tunneled with ease, not to mention lured into the "pill box" for a line-up of kills.  Enemy snipers are also easy to spot and kill, you can just sprint, or get around cover and peak out fast and return.  They will surely fire their one shot, if it manages to hit you is another story.  Just hold your breath as you peak out, and aim above their head -> DEAD.\n\nI played the game on my first play through on the hardest setting, which to be honest was extremely easy.  I ended up not evening use the scope after a while and just holding CTRL and picking off guys with head shots.\n\nThe game has a lot to offer and ways to take out enemies.\n\n- Standard Kills\n- Baiting with explosives\n- Shooting their grenades\n- Blowing up explosives near them for double and triple kills\n\nThe story is subpar if anything, I never felt emotionally involved in the main character, nor any other sub characters.\n\nOne of the best experiences was getting waves of units sent at me for immediate slaughter.\n\nThe biggest issue in this game is the horrid camera.  I cannot explain how bad this system is, but it was way too touchy.  Sometimes you would be running and turn around not realizing you just did a 360, not 180.  I also rarely found myself using anything other than grenades, and maybe a few trip wires...  I think I only used two, one in the tutorial, and one for fun.\n\nThere is also CO-OP and Online Mode, I found these to okay if you can get the right group.\n\nOverall I would say 6/10.\n\nI also received this free during the promotion, and honestly would not buy this game.","April 3, 2015","false","9.9"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","19","32","0","0"

Game after game, we are conditioned to aim for the head  thanks to the unique animations and sounds that result. But in this game, headshots are just the beginning.\n\nOn the surface, Sniper Elite V2 seems like yet another brown WW2 shooter. Every level is "bombed out European city" and you're America's answer to Golgo 13, casually blowing up tanks, trucks, and rockets with well-placed rifle fire. But the kill cam makes all the difference. With most killshots, you get a dramatic slow motion shot of the bullet traveling and killing its target. An X-Ray shot lets you see exactly which bones and vital organs are obliterated. Now, you've incentive to aim not just for the brain, but the heart. The lungs. The testes.\n\nTHIS NEVER GETS OLD. EVER.\n\nYou can adjust enemy AI and ballistic modeling to suit your tastes. Don't want the videogame-y HUD assistance? Turn it off. Want to have to adjust aim for distance? How about wind? The option's there. You can sneak if you want too, being mindful of sound and enemy line of sight as you hide bodies, cause distractions, and use a crappy silenced pistol. But there is zero penalty for neglecting to use stealth, and eventually you HAVE to fight. By all means, go...ballistic. This isn't Hitman. You have to get spotted. That's why you can and should set traps for when the Nazis and the Reds come a-runnin'. You can't set off your own mines, but you can get hurt when they do explode.\n\nThe fact that you're given points for each kill encourages you to just shoot everybody you see. Incapacitate a guy in the open to draw his friends out to save him. Then put one shot through both of them. BONUS POINTS. You actually get the fewest points for sneaking up behind someone and melee killing them. Co-op play is supported through the entire campaign (albeit with fewer X-Ray shots), and there's special co-op multiplayer as well. Versus multiplayer...eh, it's a game about camping and sniping. Don't bother with that.\n\nThe Metacritic score is wrong. The reviewers are wrong. This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed TRIUMPH, and every level is highly replayable. The DLC's pretty good too, especially its infamous "Kill Hitler" mission. No co-op on those, sadly.","January 6, 2013","true","21.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

On your way, you find out that the nazis have a last ace, the V2 Missiles, brutal weapons of mass destruction that are aimed at London, and you make it to your mission to destroy the V2s and defeat the Nazis.\n\n\n++Gameplay++\nThe game has the typical shooter corridor as the leveldesign: Take way A, B, or C, but in the end, all ways lead to the same destination. But what is different? You can sneak completely unseen past the enemies, or kill them all with your sniper rifle. Loud noises can drown the noise of your rifle, so you can shoot without warning the enemy. If you just shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything, you will alert the enemy and get quickly killed, which is positive because snipers are not supposed to take a lot of damage. You have some tools like mines and grenades to prevent soldiers from following you or flanking you. If you take out an enemy with the sniper rifle, you will most likely trigger a bullet cam that shows precisely how your bullet penetrates the body of your target, which can look disgusting at times because you see in X-Ray how the bones and organs get damaged (looks very amazing when you shoot your enemy's eye).\n\n\n++Grafics++\nThe grafics are the usual standart for shooters back in 2012. Not amazingly good, but not bad either. The faces have\nanimations, the bullet cam looks great.\n\n++Music++\nThe music gets annoying fast and is brutally loud, so turn it a little bit down before you start playing. Better play with some own music.\n\n\n++Features++\nYour sniper bullets are actually influenced by gravity and wind if you do not play on easy, which is amazing and makes the shooting harder, and requires you to think a little bit when you shoot.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nI thought that this game is like Sniper Ghost Warrior a hidden CoD clone, but it is a solid 3rd Person shooter with innovation and ideas, and that makes this game worth to be bought.

The X-Ray kills in this game are so mesmerizing. It made me go "Oooh!", or it made me go "HAH!". And the story was interesting, too. The one thing I never expected from such a great game like this is the story's length. It's damn short.

At least that's the spirit how I played it.\n\nSo, I actually won't un-recommend it because it doesn't deserve it but surely it deserves critics.\nBecause this game is wrong from the basis: it is supposed to be a "stealth game" but it is clearly not; a "sniping game" but sniper rifle isn't the most useful weapon; a "realistic game" and it is definitely not!\n\nBefore explaining my critics let me tell in advice that i played at the highest difficulty. So, let's start with the stealth factor.\n\nI won't definite this a stealth game because you can't complete any level stealthly. Well, actually you can't complete any ROOM stealthly: The only stealthy weapon you have is a silenced pistol that is way the most useful weapon of the game (But "Silenced-Pistoler elitè V2" didn't sound good enough); then you have an un-suppressed sniper rifle who aggros enemy just by pointing them (if you point them with the binoculars you will not be caught that easily); and a nice arsenal of explosives. It doesn't sound like a very quite equipment.\nIn game you fight against troopers, and snipers: the latter will shoot at you anyway (so there's no need for stealth) the firsts don't act at all like a real trained soldier: no one soldier will "pound the alarm", not even after an explosion (that's why to this game sound logical give landmines as a stealty weapon). Any un-quite action will only alarm the soldiers in nearby: it doesn't matter if you shoot away everything, blast them with grenades, or snipe efficently: you will never be in permanent trouble.\nAlso, if a soldier finds a dead body he doesn't pound the alarm of call for reinforcements (there's no such a thing in this game) he just stays close to the body, wondering what could this mean.\nIf you try instead to move the body you will alarm the enemy because you are being loud.\nSo: leaving a body is not a negative beavior because it doesn't get you in trouble, actually is a POSITIVE beavior because you can fill the body with mines. Stealth. Sniper.\nAnother example of the lack of logic is the tank AI. They act like dogs. Indeed, like dogs: If a tank see you it will shoot cannonballs as long as you are in his line of sight, than it just go away. Like a dog barking to defend its territory.\nOh, yes, and of course a tank shooting does not alarm nearby soldiers.\n\nAnother disturbing element is that the game gives you an arsenal for a preparatory game: you should know the territory, what will happen, then you plant mines and choose your position accordingly. But this never happens: you just follow the track, snipe the main target (or snipe some explosives, just to remain stealth) from a position unknown from the beginning, and at last you fight your way out without knowing in advice what way will be.\nSo: what's the point with mines?\n\nI think the game is the result of a developing team that didn't follow the same line guide: some one wanted to make a stealth game, and some one other said that didn't sell enought.","December 18, 2015","false","15.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Its bullet physics, and the visceral impact the game displays to you is all awesome, and probably worth the purchase alone at the right price.  However, instead of presenting you with a lot interesting sharpshooter scenarios, the game tends to put you more into a meat grinder, by throwing wave after wave of enemies at you.  There were a few times during the game where I had to make a complex shot on my target.  Those instances were fun.  But, they only lasted maybe 2 minutes a piece.  The rest of the game revolves around shooting Nazi A, Nazi B, or Nazi C, (or Russian A, Russian B, or Russian C).\n\nIt stops being a sniper game, and becomes a standard shooter.  The times where I had to time my shots to coincide with artillery shells exploding were awesome.  There needs to be more intersting things like that.  Or, if they are going to force me into a building to retrieve a document, I would like to have some sort of melee or takedown option because I always favor stealth over guns blazing.  Overall, now that I have thought about it enough while writing this review, the game is kind of cheap.  Which can make the awesome bullet cam seem like a gimmick.\n\nI can see how someone would think the entire game was basically that, and the rest is just cheap window dressing (i.e. great bullet cam... lame story, cheap enemies, meat grinder missions, poor voice overs, repetive music).  I'm a little torn on this game, but I can't recommend it.","March 10, 2014","false","7.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

The tutorial that teaches the player to lay traps made me hopeful, but then the real maps were just as linear as the tutorial maps. There is no scouting of the location, no finding alternative exits, etc. There is only one road and after you take your sniping shot, the game will tell you when to run and which way to run. This game resembles typical shooters way more than I'd like it.\n\nI'm not an expert on AI, but it takes me out of the game when the enemy is coming towards me in a single line one by one and they don't react when I shoot them one by one. It also breaks the illusion when the level designers intentionally set up a bossfight-esque event when dozens of enemies are aware of me and shooting at me and I have to snipe them all before I can go on. These kind of things shouldn't be orchestrated, but naturally emerge from the gameplay.\n\nAll in all I was very disappoined by this game as a sniper game, especially because this title is such well recognized as a good sniper franchise.","February 27, 2015","false","6.4"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","24","43","0","2"

Pero ahora su protagonista principal, Karl Fairburne, un oficial americano de la Oficina de Servicios Estratégicos debe capturar o eliminar a los científicos que participan en el programa alemán de cohetes V2.\n\nOfrece tanto modo de juego de un jugador (misión o desafío), modo cooperativo y multijugador. A diferencia de muchos juegos de este estilo, en Sniper Elite V2 se utiliza el sigilo antes que la fuerza bruta. Fairburne usa distintos tipos de armas como 5 fusiles de francotirador, subfusiles, pistolas, granadas, minas, piedras, etc. El jugador tendrá que enfrentarse a continuas decisones, tales como elegir entre hacer un disparo perfecto que descubra su posición o buscar una ruta más difícil que les permita continuar con su misión. Una de las principales características de este título es el realismo de balística que ofrece, donde factores como el viento, velocidad, gravedad y demás afectan a las balas e incluso se debe pausar la respiración para apuntar mejor.\n\nOtra de las novedades es la "Kill Cam", un modo de vista que se activa al realizar un disparo particularmente extremo, siguiendo la trayectoria de la bala a cámara lenta hasta que éste penetra en el cuerpo del enemigo el cual se muestra su interior para ver como causa daño a los órganos y huesos. Otros nuevos elementos incluyen la posibilidad de marcar los enemigos para poner de relieve su posición junto con la información de destino, y una figura blanca delineada que marca el punto en el que los soldados enemigos avistaron al jugador por última vez para que éste pueda hacer su escape. También tienes la oportunidad de conseguir nuevas armas a medida que vayas progresando en cada misión y seleccionarlas en tu inventario antes de comenzar las misiones de cada juego.\n\nFusile\nM1903A4 Springfield\nMosin-Nagant\nGewehr 43\nKarabiner 98k\nSVT-40\nLee-Enfield No.1 Mk.III - DLC\nArisaka Tipo 99 - DLC\nCarabina M1 - DLC\nM1-D Garand - DLC\n\nSubfusiles\nM1A1 Thompson\nMP40\nPPSh-41\nBlyskawica - DLC\n\nFusiles de asalto\nSturmgewehr 44 - DLC\nPistolas[editar]\nWelrod Mark I\nColt M1911A1\nLuger P08\nWebley Mk VI - DLC\nTokarev TT-33 - DLC\n\nArrojadizas y explosivos\nGranada F-1\nStielhandgranate\nMina terrestre\nMina de tracción\nDinamita\n\nRequisitos\nSistema operativo: Microsoft® Windows® Vista (Service Pack 2) o Windows® 7 o Windows® 8.

The character narration and enviromental settings take you on a simulated journey of taking on the role of an American sniper, and such is quite charming. The plotline of this game is enticing enough to keep the player interesting in progressing further through the game.\n\nHowever, my bit of beef with this game is that the sniping mechanics are so well-rounded and the other forms of assault are poorly constructed (in my honest opinion). Other than the sniping, the combat lacks stability and can become very frustrating when some missions require you to take a ground-level approach. I have yet to fully progress through the game but I have already come across this issue a number of times.\n\nI highly recommend this game for any stealth-shooter fans or history buffs! (though 30 dollars is a hefty price to pay; waiting until a sale would be ideal). If you were able to grab it for free the other day, then wonderful!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deralleintiger/recommended/63380/","deralleintiger","DerAlleinTiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deralleintiger/","121 products in account","Sniper Elite V2 is one of those games that's hit-or-miss (pun semi-intended).  I only just got the PC version, but I've had the Xbox 360 version for close to a year now and the only difference I can see is the graphics quality.  In fact, let's start with that, shall we?\n\nThe graphics of Sniper Elite V2 are surprisingly excellent.  The game world itself is far from beautiful, but that is to be expected when you're a lone wolf sniper crawling through the rubble of Berlin in the twilight hours of the Second World War.  The amount of detail is extraordinary.  You can see the leathery texture of an SS officer's jacket just as you're about to blow his brains out.  My only concern is, perhaps, optimization.  Could have used a bit more, but nothing too serious.\n\nThe storyline is nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done of linking the missions together.\n\nA lot of the time you'll be crawling around in the ruined streets of Berlin, but you do get to see a few other environments.  Each of the levels is quite linear.  To a lot of players, this is what breaks the game, and I can understand that.  However if  you can get past the linearity it is still a very enjoyable experience.\n\nAs for the gameplay, well, it's a sniper game.  You get a sniper rifle, a pistol, and an SMG, along with various booby traps.  The star of the show truly is your rifle.  This should be your go-to weapon throughout most of the game.  The sniper mechanics in this game are phenomenal, and highly customizable.  Bad shot?  You can set it so that bullets come right out of CoD and hit where you're aiming.  Just got off of a BF gaming binge?  You can set it so that bullets are effected by gravity.  Really want to challenge yourself?  You can set it so that not only is there bullet drop, but also wind as well.  On top of this, you will always have to watch your heartrate.  If you're running around a lot, your heart rate is going to spike and your scope will sway heavily.  Stay low, move slowly, and take your time and your heart rate will drop and you can focus on the shot or even slow time.\n\nOnce you take that shot, it is very likely that you will go into a bullet cam, which will often show an X-ray view of your target as their organs are shredded by your sniper shot.  You can control the frequency of these bullet cams if you're squeamish or just don't like much gore, but I do not believe you can completely turn them off.  It is, however, quite satisfying when you see your round enter through an enemy's skull, exit out the other side, tumble realistically through the air, and proceed to take out his buddy behind him.\n\nThat AI themselves are quite varied between the difficulty levels.  Easy AI will have them walking in circles, wondering where the sniper is that just dropped their friend while you proceed to plink away at their ranks.  Hard AI means that one wrong shot will result in your death.  Medium AI is comfortably in between the two.\n\nFinally, the co-op and multiplayer...  I admit that I have not tried to competitive multiplayer yet, but I did take a quick glance at the options and servers.  There are quite a few servers running and the options for a custom match are outrageous.  As for co-op, you can team up with a shooting buddy and take on either a challenge mission or a wave-based survival mode.  I can say that both of these are extremely fun and, in some ways, make up for the singleplayers linearity with open maps that allow you to roost in whatever sniper perch you find suitable.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd say that Sniper Elite V2 is not a game that I would pay a full $60 USD for.  At the current price of $30 USD, however, it is a great game, so long as you're interested.  If you're looking for a game that has basic, yet functioning, stealth mechanics, fun cooperative play, and excellent sniping mechanics, then I suggest you pick up Sniper Elite V2.  It's not the end-all-be-all of sniper games, but it's a hell of a lot better than Sniper: Ghost Warrior.  I can tell you that much!","November 3, 2013","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Highly recomended in addition to the Sniper Elite: Nazi Zombie Army series and Sniper Elite III: Africorps.","December 11, 2014","true","108.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Differentiates itself from the current 'modern' trend.  Appreciate WWII was the big thing 5-10 years ago.\n+Graphics.  Decent graphics, some nice effects like fire and explosions that look good without too much scrutiny.\n+Physics.  Completed on Sniper Elite difficulty so got to experience some decent bullet drop balistics etc.  Shots are definitely missable if you're not careful.\n+X-Ray Kill Cam.  This just never gets old.  Ever.  There's something immensely satisfying seeing the skeleton of your enemy shatter into little bits.\n+Campaign length.  Though it could be completed quicker (I'm sure), I got a good 10+ hours out of the single player.\n\nNegatives:\n-A.I.  Far too easy.  The game can effectively be progressed by simply giving your position away, letting the A.I. run around in the open as they try to hit you.  Makes sniping actually a little too easy.\n-Opernplatz.  There's a progression bug on this map. I hit it, couldn't get past and ended up shelving the game for 6-12 months.  Thankfully, a fresh download seemed to let me move on when I finally returned.  Very disappointing.\n-Story.  Generic America saves the world (well, America saves London in this instance).  Not very exciting and a little too Hollywood.\n-Linearity.  Maps can be moved across using various routes but it's essentially a point A to point B fare.  Shame really.\n-Kit too situational.  I had mines, trip mines, dynamite, grenades and a rock (no, NOT  Dwayne Johnson) but using them was VERY situational.  Had the game given me better A.I. (i.e. supressing and flanking etc.) then maybe I'd have used a more tactical approach such as trip mining doorways and the like - but the game just doesn't need it.  You can treat it like any other shooter and progress just fine.  A massively missed opportunity.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely say I had fun with Sniper Elite V2 (taking aside Opernplatz) and would recommend it as being 'worth playing'.  Arguably one of the better sniping games in recent years.\n\nLastly, it's really cheeky of Rebellion to peddle DLC and the next game on the exit screen.  Bad form, folks.\n\n","June 26, 2014","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/63380/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","Let me start out by saying this: I own this game for the 360 and have put dozens of hours into it. I've beat it multiple times and have gone back to redo levels just for fun. When the giveaway for this popped up, I couldn't wait to have another copy for PC.\n\nThis game is my favorite shooter of all time, and I play a lot of them between twelve separate game systems. There is endless replayability in this game...this is the type of game where if you mess up and die, it really doesn't bother you, because it's so much freaking fun to go back through it again and again. Obviously, the game is centered around being a sniper during World War II, though you also have other methods of killing Nazis at your disposal, including a silenced pistol, mines, etc. You can play this game any way you want. If you'd like to go for stealth, you can try timing your sniper shots with the soundwaves of nearby explosions, sirens, etc. so that you remain undetected, all while hiding bodies. OR, you could rush into situations, hole up in a room, set some traps at the door and wait for the Nazis to come to you. Ideally, you'll want to settle somewhere in the middle, but the fact that you are free to choose how to progress is liberating.\n\nThe bullet cam pushes this game over the line from "superb" to "awesometacular." For many of your sniper bullets, the camera will follow your bullet and slow down time, showing you exactly how well you aimed your shot by offering to you an "inside the body" view of the damage your bullet does to an unfortunate Nazi. If you get a headshot where your bullet explodes an eye, it shows you that. The gore, while present, is also realistic. It's not over-the-top to be over-the-top, but it is oddly and disturbingly satisfying. I can't count the numbers of times I've yelled out loud, "NICE!" or "Did I get the eye? Did I get the eye? YESSSS!!!" Trust me...you'll be doing this often, as this game makes you feel like an absolute badass.\n\nFinally, the environments are varied and interesting. You'll be going through streets full of ruined homes, cities on fire, having sniper battles on rooftops (my favorite mission)...not to mention they also offer two types of collectibles that are actually fun to search for. I'm a "game collectible" fiend, and this game does it best, in my opinion, over any other game with collectibles that I've ever played. One of the collectibles is a brown bottle that each level has a set amount of. You have to shoot them to collect them, so you'll be having a lot of fun finding these in hidden, far off places, on the map or off. Also, these bottles are hidden well. You can tell the devs had a ton of fun hiding them in ridiculous places, rather than just putting them in corners and calling it a day.\n\nIn summary, this game is a god among games. It does everything right, and adds some interesting and original ideas to the genre...a genre already unfortunately low in sniper-focused games. I only preorder about one game every few years...and this is the game that convinced me to make that game Sniper Elite 3, because this game is just untouchable. This is a game you will play and replay just for the pure entertainment value. If you don't have it yet, buy it. You won't regret it.","June 6, 2014","true","21.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story is quite good, well narrated and motivates to keep playing. This was my second Sniper game that i played, the fist one was Ghost Warrior, and gotta say loved both!\n\nBut although the story is quite good, can't say the same about the levels, the are bit short take around 25min to complete it (depends on the difficulty) and also doesn't give a lot of exploration. In addition, there is far to much focus on close quarters combat for this to really take the art of sniping seriously.\n\nThe best part of the game for is definitely the Bullet Travel, amazing, you see guy at 180m you hold your breath and shoot to his head, bam, amazing!\n\nStrong recommend this game!\n\n~ 8/10\n","June 10, 2014","true","6.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you're used to fast paced games like Battlefield or COD, and like to snipe on them, this is a lot different.

The missions are repetitive, the gameplay is pretty bad, and the performance isnt very good. I'm not even sure if there was a strong plot, because I had toned out the monotone narration of the protagonist after about 5 minutes. From what little I gathered, the plot is practically non-existent, and there is no way to be interested in any of the characters.\n\nThis game's only stong point is its famous killcams which, by the end of the game, have become extremely repetitive and not very satisfying.","April 1","false","9.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Personally i love it but there is the option to reduce its frequency if you want to.\n\nThe game's story is forgetable and it's there only as a reason for you to snipe some dudes.\n\nOn a technical level the game looks and performs great and there are lots of options in the menu to customize your experience. A benchmark is also included.\n\nWhat stood out for me though in the technical aspect was, inspite of the levels being pretty big and beautiful, the load times were incredibly short and almost zero on my dated sata2 7200.11 drive.\n\nAs far as multiplayer is concerned there is a slew of co-op missions and 3 different modes as well as vs with a server browser. From what i got to play the netcode was good and the vs part was surprisingly active and fast for a sniper game as you could tag opponents for your teammates to see, effectively countering camping to a degree and preventing the game from becoming a total snoozefest.\n\nRecommended.","July 11, 2013","true","18.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If you want a more realistic shooter, buy any of the terribly inaccurate Call of Duty series. That's how bad this game is.\n\nThis game is an embarassment to any "sniping" game. You can NOT change shoulders at all which in a third person shooter is extremely frustrating and will kill your more than anything else in the game. The cover system is complete and total sh** by not letting you peek out to shoot whenever it wants to, and the fact that you have to FULLY EXPOSE yourself to make a shot. Secondly this game demands you either make a headshot or shoot something vital i.e the heart or lungs in order to kill someone in the multiplayer which is total sh** again because WWII had little to no body armor at all (Yes there was body armor in WWII that's when it started being made i.e flak jackets).\n\nThe ballistics on the weapons are very poor; in the multiplayer I shot someone five times in the inside of the thigh, groin, and pelvis with a 1911. I have fired a 1911 and .45's tend to put people on their butt really easily. And seeing as the femoral artery is in the inner thigh and pretty easy to hit, that guy should have died. Instead he pulled his sidearm and shot me in the face once and continued to run around unhindered. Another thing is that your rifle bullets will ALWAYS over penetrate in the campaign. BULLETS DO NOT DO THIS! Especially the rifles used in WWII, not every shot would over penetrate.\n\nThe last thing that really annoyed me was how the game sends you alone with no spotter or back up. Sorry, snipers never work alone. That is a HUGE pet peeve of mine with most shooting games: they all think snipers are lone wolf bamf's who can do reach into their pack, pull on their Super Man cape and save the day. That and the fact that you can soak up any round type in the campaign and be perfectly fine after hiding in cover for a few seconds makes this game completely and totally worthless.","June 6, 2014","false","6.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

They really drive home the point that this is a sniping game by giving you a very small amount of ammo for your tommygun and pistol. It means that 95% or higher of your kills will be by sniping. It makes it frustrating at times because you have to face off against a squad of guys, ten to twenty guys usually, and snipe them all down. It is not hard at all, just that sniping gets old after a while. The bullet cam is one of the cooler ideas that I have ever seen in a game but unless you turn down its frequency in the options then you are going to be seeing it hundreds of times in the game and it gets old real fast. The realism is entirely absent and the game is highly inconsistent. What I mean is that sometimes a bullet through the chest of an enemy will kill him but a lot of times it just does 50% dmg to him and he stands there like nothing happened to him and fires exactly the same as before you shot him. Tanks also have external gas tanks on them that blow the tank up when shot. Gee, if only it were that simple in real war. Enemy snipers also are psychic. They are magically aware of your exact location and pull off pinpoint headshots on you even when you are somewhere that they should have no idea about, even when you have only snuck around a corner into view without making any noise and they are very far away across the map. The AI is also dumb as fk. They stand up out of cover and stand out in the open the entire game, making snipe-killing them a cinch. Snipers are somewhat hidden but when you see where they are they make almost no effort to re-adjust when you fire their way. They just stand and fire in a snipe battle with you until you quickly kill them. Use your tommygun and pistol ammo very, very sparingly, as you get such a small amount and there are usually no places to get any more ammo during a level until the next level starts and you are magically at full ammo again.\n\nI tried the MP briefly and I have to say it was fun. And surprisingly it still has enough of a fan base that you will find games to join. It has all the classic game modes too: dm, tdm, and ctf, and several co-op modes.\n\nThe game has more of a arcade feel to it than an actual sniping game but it is still a pretty decent game that is optimized pretty good and runs smoothly. It can be fun for a once-through, but it is only about as good as the average professional review of the game which was between 60 and 70 out of 100.","November 1, 2014","true","7.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

This is actually crucial if you are playing this on harder difficulty, but I just played it on normal difficulty and still found that being stealthy and doing stealth kills is a plus rather than go charging and spraying.\n\nWhat I didn't like so far was the fact that there were no *silenced* sniper rifles, or at least an option to add a silence to it. Because I prefer that all my shots from out of line of sight be quiet shots rather than me kill one person and then a battalion of troops somehow find out where I am camping and start blasting my area!\n\nBut I suppose back in the day - there weren't really any silenced sniper rifles, were there? If that were the case in this game is trying to be as close as possible to what it was like back in the WW2 days with what weapons and arms existed at the time, ok fair enough I won't argue with that; however, if not - I do wish there was some sort of silencer for the rifles. Though if this is really an *action* intended game rather than stealth/action, ok I can understand them not adding a attachable/detachable silencer of sorts to any gun.\n\nYes there is a silenced pistol I use to do stealth kills, but that won't get a target that's 1km away from where you stand/crouch/prone!\n\nBut that's it, everything else is perfectly fine!\n\nWhat's next is to find some people that I can do co-op mode with throughout the entire game to see what that's like.\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to Sniper Elite 3. Might grab the first one to see how it all started.","November 23, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The less than frantic tempo appealed to me, and it's pretty cool, with the excellent bullet cam, to see a round go from your muzzle to smashing through, x-ray style, a Nazi head, body or testicles. The game is fairly linear, but it does try to give a few more open world options in certain places as well. Not quite a classic, but overall, recommended, and I'm looking forward to playing Sniper Elite 3 at some point for sure.","July 12, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall, it's a 6/10, and I will explain why.\n\nInitially, I got this game on the day it was free, so it scores some bonus points for not costing me any dosh. I installed it right away, excited about a WW2 Sniper shooter! I went in expecting levels with a wide variety of paths, ways to complete your goals, and all sorts of neato things like that. However, I was somewhat disappointed. I write this on finishing the campaign on the Sniper Elite, or Hard, Difficulty of the game.\n\nOver a mind numbing 8 or so hours of dying, dying some more, crawling before dying, and dying again, I finally finished. On these 8 hours, I have to say that the campaign is fairly linear in the paths you can take, with only a few special spots you can get up in that give you any real advantage over the super aim of enemy soldiers. There's not many ways to skin the cat either, when it comes to completing goals or shooting targets. There's one set vantage point, or one set way to stop a convoy of vehicles, etc. I will applaud the story, though, for obtaining my interest and keeping it through the duration of the campaign.\n\nOn the story, it's somewhat generic, and I won't spoil it in this review. It was enough of a fresh breath, though, compared to the games around it that it stands out.\n\nMechanics wise, the bullet drop is interesting. Not as punishing or realistic as Red Orchestra 2, but not as rediculously cheesy as a game like COD. The cover system is mediocre, with your body sometimes sticking out enough for enemies to be able to shoot you, and on sniper elite, this will kill you every time. Enemy detection works alright, and the AI is fairly cohesive. I found myself flanked from time to time, and they aren't grenade spammy.\n\nI don't care about graphics, so that doesn't weigh into this score.\n\nThe multiplayer is fun with friends, and so is the co-op. Otherwise, don't bother.\n\nOverall, this game is a short, interesting little game about killing Nazis and Reds. Would I buy it? Only on sale. Would I reccommend it to friends? No. 6/10, and I'll probably wind up getting more time in it playing co-op matches and free for alls with friends, and having a grand time of it.","June 10, 2014","true","22.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This engaged my love for the game, even if I am the worst player alive.\n\nYou play as sniper dude, (If you play co-op, you/your friend plays as sniper guy instead) and you must assasinate multiple targets which are guarded by half a military, by yourself. (or with only 1 ally, depends if you co-op) This shouldn't be a hard task, though; because you're the 1337 sniper.\n\nI have not beat the game as of yet, this is mostly a review on the gameplay.\nI'm glad it doesn't make the game hell on earth if you screw up stealth, so it feels like you can play it multiple ways, but it is strongly encouraged to play stealthy, as it is a sniper game.  The game features this little thing where you can shoot someone, and go into slow mo, and once the bullet hits the target you can see the area of damage and what bones you broke. (Like Mortal Kombat)\n\nYou should play it.","June 6, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

The only bad thing for me is you can only have up 2 players in cooperative game play and observer game play.

I never play FPS games because they make me motion sick. So I'm really entirely new to the genre. I couldn't play Doom, Unreal, Quake or anything else because I'd be sicker than a dog in 5 minutes. Sniper Elite V2 is probably the first shooter I could...ahem...stomache.\n\nSo after not puking while playing the demo, I decided to get SE V2 on sale and I was really pleasantly surprised. It's a lot of fun sneaking around, figuring out the best angles, staying hidden, spotting your target and pulling off a brilliant shot. It's one of my better "hmmm, let's take a chance" purchases on Steam.\n\nOf course, the sniper rifle isn't the only thing available to you. You have your trusty Thompson machine gun and a silenced pistol. You also have grenades (though very limited amounts), tripwires, mines and even rocks (nothing better to try to get a guard to investigate an area). Each map is laid out like a puzzle and it's up to you to solve it. Do you run and gun? Do you sneak? Do you lure your enemies into a trap-filled area and watch them blow up? With numerous options and difficulty levels, it can be a challenging game the 2nd or 3rd time through.\n\nPersonally, I'm pretty hardcore. I like the sneaking method. So I take my time, creep into position, take my shot and get the heck out of there before the Germans come running. It's great fun and I feel that there's a sense of accomplishment when I can do that.\n\nAre there problems? Yep. Some enemies are scripted to "see" you when they enter the map. Other enemies don't appear on the map until you hit a specific waypoint. These scripted challenges make the game feel artificially difficult and occasionally downright cheap. Truly, the game works best when it lets you play the pure role of the sniper, but some maps and areas are little more than stand-up firefights. SE V2 doesn't do these very well, so these missions or areas become tedious fast. Of course there's also MP, but that's not my thing and the MP community has already moved on to SE3.\n\nThe other aspects - the story, the "bullet kill cam", the (few) different weapons - didn't really interest me all that much. The graphics are fine but they're certainly not top notch. But since I found great pleasure in spending 20 minutes creeping into just the right position to blow Generic German #142's head clean off, I quite enjoyed it. Enough to play all the way through at least twice.\n\nSo if the demo appeals to you, go ahead and grab it. YMMV.","February 18, 2015","true","37.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But what this game does bring to the table is entirely different.\n\n* Multiplayer community is alive\n* Has CTF, TDK and TTH modes which can be played to kill time (a lot).\n* Co-op Campaign and Kill Tally\n\nIf you have played Sniper Elite : Berlin 1945 then you'll feel a bit let down with this, but it makes up for it with the online community, graphics (x-ray kill cams) and game modes!

I first got it for free on my old pc and played it. It was fun but my pc wasn't good enough to handle it. After getting my gaming pc, i've been playing it, and I seriously enjoyed it! It's really brutal and obviously not for the faint of heart but it's a thrilling and super fun experience. The game makes you feel skilled similiar to games like CS:GO and that really attracted me to it. If it's on sale or something for like 10-15 dollars, I'd get it.

In this game you play as a generic American White male with no backstory sent to single handedly take out hundreds of nazis. Bullet ballistics can be tweaked to be affected by wind, gravity, or nothing for a casual experience. The game does allow you to equip a secondary SMG and pistol but close quarters combat is usually not the correct play because you die very easily in this game. Enemy AI is competent enough to try to flank you while a sniper or mg nest pins you down.\n\nThe shooting feels and sounds great. Also the by now iconic gore kill cams of the series are of course present and do a good job at breaking up the monotony of the otherwise very basic combat. There's nothing like seeing the same bullet enter the heart of one enemy and exit out te testicles of another. :) The kill cam can be turned off or lessened.\n\nStealth is by far the most fun and effective way to play this game. However this is where the game's greatest issue surfaces. While the original sniper elite was about open levels where stealth was incredibly encouraged, Sniper Elite V2's levels feel like guided linear corridors in comparison. Stealth is also just not always an option sometimes which is frustrating.\n\nEnemy AI is for the most part decent. However, one annoyance was that if you are detected by one enemy soldier, for some reason literally all other enemies in the vicinity will immediately know your exact location.\n\nThe game also has co-op missions/hoard mode which has no one playing it atm and multiplayer which is still active with a very small community. That being said as someone in US WEST, the closest server to me had a ping of over 500.\n\nOverall the base game is great fun but even for the somewhat low base price of 20 USD I say perhaps wait for a sale unless you really love sniping games. I usually take my time with games but for this game the main campaign literally took me only 6 hours to beat on the "medium" difficulty.\n\nAs for the DLC, Neudorf features an open map that shows that the majority of the main game's maps should've been like. Aka decent sized maps where you can choose how to tackle the objective and use stealth. Landwehr is the hardest one by far which 100% requires stealth or you will lose. St. Pierre is extremely mediocre. All the mentioned DLC take about an hour each to beat which honestly isn't enough content for full price. Kill Hitler might seem cool at first... that is until you realize that you are paying 8 USD for a mission that is literally 20 minutes long.","May 13","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The game is about the sniper stopping the V2 missiles from being launched but really, you probably won't care about the story. This game is all about the satisfying sniping mechanics. When you pull of a long distance shot, the game will follow that bullet in slow motion and show you where you hit the enemy and what bones you shattered. The game is extremely brutal but that is part of the fun. The game offers high difficulties that will make the sniping even more satisfying with more things to take into account such as the wind and how it will affect the destination of the bullet, and general bullet drop based on distance. The game doesn't offer a great amount of weapons for you to choose from but they all feel pretty great to use. The campaign in this game isn't all that long. You can finish it within 6-10 hours depending on the difficulty and how you progress through the stealth sections.

How someone can recognize you as an enemy from 200 meters away or spot you while in the prone position and not moving from 50 meters is beyond me. That is the only real major issue I had with the game. Everything else: good story, fun gameplay, nice graphics, fitting music, and the slow motion kills/effects never get old.\n\nI played both the Sniper Elite Nazi Zombie Army games before this one and I now realize how much of the zombie games were just carbon copies of the base game.

The game is about the sniper stopping the V2 missiles from being launched but really, you probably won't care about the story. This game is all about the satisfying sniping mechanics. When you pull of a long distance shot, the game will follow that bullet in slow motion and show you where you hit the enemy and what bones you shattered. The game is extremely brutal but that is part of the fun. The game offers high difficulties that will make the sniping even more satisfying with more things to take into account such as the wind and how it will affect the destination of the bullet, and general bullet drop based on distance. The game doesn't offer a great amount of weapons for you to choose from but they all feel pretty great to use. The campaign in this game isn't all that long. You can finish it within 6-10 hours depending on the difficulty and how you progress through the stealth sections. One mode I can't really comment on is the coop in this game because unfortunately, I have no friends that wish to play this with me and I couldn't find anyone online. If you wish to get more out of this game, be sure to have a friend that wants to play it as well since the coop is dead. The sound in this game was pretty great and the graphics were good. The challenge maps were pretty good and it was pretty satisfying to shoot Hitler straight in the balls. 75 + 5 for being able to shoot Hitler in the balls and have an awesome bullet cam for it. 80/100","July 7, 2013","true","12.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game itself is not hugely long however the killcams/x-ray slow mo kills are both brutal and satisfying to pull off. There is some dlc available for this game which adds a couple more single player missions but also some new rifles/sidearms which give you a nice overall choice. Would definately recommend even tho it was from 2012 the multiplayer and co op modes add extra longevity to a very decent game!","January 14, 2014","true","68.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game flies in the face of game logic that bringing a sniper rifle to a firefight means insta-death for you, with it expecting you to use the rifle in close-quarters combat, as the regular machine guns are the useless weapons this time round.\n\nWhat you're left with is basically a shoot-em-up, going from point A to B, and repeat, plowing through firefights as you go. You might be expecting some sort of sniper simulator, but even in this game you're a super soldier single-handedly winning the war by wading into battlegrounds, walking up to enemies and shooting them no problem. On harder difficulties it instead turns to frustration as you have to restart the entire part several times because of a hidden sniper taking you out when the coast was supposedly clear.\n\nWith no variation, it gets boring fast, if not infuriating.\n\nA Steam game review without any forced jokes.

I played on normal as a clasical FPS scum and it was a breeze. Stealth melee kills give only 10 points, while a full alert sniper rifle kill gives 25. Also, a game that has to limit the ammo of the smg to add up to the stealth is defenatly doing something wrong. In the end Youre just a superman wining the war all by yourself.\n\nCant say anything about higher dificultys, but if You dont want to spend half an hour creeping around linear streets filled with enemys and still killing all of them (because the map is so narrow) or go in guns blazing this isnt a game for You.\n\nAlso, what was a russian sniper doing on a roof of a german held museum 5 meteres from a german infantryman?

Game had alot of potential - graphics are great.  Physics are neat - and sometimes glitchy af.\n\nmost of the game was more or less cod with a scoped rifle.  not sure why it makes sense for a sniper objective to require clearing out the map - esp parts with 10+ AI in the same spot running at you with machine guns.\n\n-3 for terrible AI and bad pacing.  AI can shoot through walls.  Most of the time, enemies won't spawn until you walk up far enough.  Several places they will spawn right on top of you.  This really makes sense for a sniper game?  No.\n\n-2 for terrible difficulty scaling.  Headshots don't always instakill - yeah makes sense with a sniper rifle okay.  The game doesn't get tougher with the difficulty raised.  All they did was increase the bot HP/accuracy.\n\n-2 for terrible controls.  After you carry a body, and put it down, your guy stands up and makes noise.  Sometimes walking over parts of the map with rubble makes your guy trip and make noise.  You can climb up spots in the map, but you can't climb down - you have to jump?  Half the time when you try searching a body, it will trade your gun instead of searching the body.  The "throw" arc doesn't work well at all, it's very inaccurate and doesn't always show\n\n-1 for locking the over-shoulder camera to one position.  This makes it very annoying to shoot from the left side of cover.\n\n-1 for awful weapon system.  You can only sight down the sniper rifles.  You basically hipfire every other gun.  It gives you a tiny focus, but it's all hipfire.  This makes a headshot on a guy 10 feet in front of you random luck.  Yeah it's a sniping game, but if we have to kill loads of enemies what good is hipfire with only 1 clip?\n\nMost annoying game I've played in awhile.","May 24, 2015","false","13.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Often times you will find yourself in the "same" buidling even in different places in the same map.  The encounters tend to blur together after a while.  Its all the same stuff over and over.  I would say that the only difference is the back-drop, but even that is mostly the same.\n\nThe ugly:  The AI is insanely bad.  Enemies will happly re-position themselves in the same exact spot, the spot that contains a pile of corpses and proceed to quickly add to that pile.   The game sends waves of enemies after you, and each wave will do the same exact thing.  So you just fight the battle you just fought 2 or even 3 times in a row.  It is also annoying how you can "clear" an area of enemies, and then step over some invisible line and suddenly a new wave of guys appears out of thin-air.  Sometimes from rooms behind you with no possible way for them to have gotten past you.\n\nOnce the AI is "aggroed", it will always know where you are.  It is both amusing and sad to see a bunch of the AI dudes tracking you though solid walls, standing there shooting at you endlessly.  They almost NEVER seek you out beyond thier scripted pattern of movement.  They could just run into a building or up some stairs to get you, but unless it is a scripted event they will stand there shooting at you through the walls, floors or celings.\n\nI have played enough of this game and I just can't take it anymore.  If you are bored, I wouldn't pay more than $1.99 for it.  I did manage to get 7 hours out of it before I couldn't stomach it anymore.","November 15, 2014","false","7.3"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","24","46","0","0"

The sniping mechanics themselves are spot-on and are the best thing about the game. However, most of the levels have sections where sniping is effectively impossible thanks to too many corridors and enemies in confined spaces. This combined with the fact your other weapons are awful and that the AI knows exactly where you are when you fire, makes these urban sections terribly tedious. Its a shame because the sniping segments are massively fun, but the rest of the mechanics let the game down.","April 23, 2014","false","5.3"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","25","48","0","0"

There's not even a reference to a female. At least that hoary old man-fest Gears of War had a female pilot and, um, Dom's wife.

Been there done that.\nBut what is it then that makes this game special?\n\nIt's the way it does all these things.\nso yhea the gameplay is very repetetive. all you do is move from A to B, set up and shoot a couple of nazi's through their head.\nBut how. The sniping mechanic in this game is as realistic as i've seen so far in a game.\nDo it right and they won't know that you are there. ♥♥♥♥ it up and it's game over. You won't be able to take that much hits so stealth is key.\nBut expect the frequent fire fights. And that is also something to prepare for. Set up some trip wires, or place a mine under a dead soldier.\n\nThe sniping mechanic is the point of the game. And that is it strongest point.\nIt can be customised to with, But if everything is enabled, it will be as real as it gets.\nTake the bullet drip into consideration, and be sure that the wind isn't too strong. Even the gun you are using makes a change in how the bullet drops.\nBut as soon as you pull the trigger the fun happens. Did you hit the target or did you miss?\nAlways a fun to see when you actually hit your target. Watch as the bullet slowly enters the enemy's brain and launch small bits of skull and brain through the air.\n\nLevel wise, It is nothing really spectacular. Mainly it are the common urban World War 2 settings. (in this case mainly Berlin). With sometimes a country side mission here and there. And the missions are pretty linear.\nBut is that taking away the fun. Not for me.\n\nWeapons.\nNot many weapons are featured in the game. Some pretty common World war 2 sniper rifles. (Even some japanese models, Don't ask me why. Since the japanese aren't even mentioned in the game). A couple of common sub machine guns. And some traps.\nBut in this case it is in fact Less is more. Because even though there aren't that many guns, They all differ quite a lot from each other. Each sniper rifle has it's own pro's and cons. And that is what makes the difference.\n\nDLC, It's not that spectacular. Some maps, some guns.\nBut one map in particular which i find oddly enjoying. Of course i am reffering to the Kill Hitler DLC.\nNothing feels better than putting a bullet through the head of Hitler himself. Or at least a video game representation of him.\n\nSo sniper Elite V2.\nIt is a nice game. Not the best game ever. But gameplay wise it's something new. Not something we frequently see in this age's third person shooters.\nIt's a game that is nothing special, but also a lot of special all in once. that is what makes it great.","December 25, 2013","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The stealth component is a bit awkward (or I'm just terrible at it) but fortunately stealth is never required, just recomended. Also, sometimes it seems like the AI can't decide if they're blind drunk or wall hacking. But, none of that really matters because the core component, sniping, is absolutely fantastic. The bullet cam is like a mix between the Fallout series's VATS, when it does the cinematic kills, and the weird CSI stuff when they show people getting shot to death, it's awesome, almost gratuitously gory and incredibly satisfying. This game seems like it'd be really intensive with all the bullet physics and stealth, but if you're lame you can turn off the bullet physics, make the AI all mostly stupid, and increase the occurence of bullet cam kills and the game becomes just a fun gore fest.\nAlso, I shot a guy though the eye and it went through and hit someone else's grenade causing an awesome explosion. 10/10","March 12, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got it free hence my recommendation.\n\nAt times this game had me cheering, cringing or cursing.\n\nCheering:\n\n- It is immensely satisfying when you line up that perfect shot in a set piece and you watch the impact in that x-ray bullet cam.\n- The scripted set pieces (i.e. defending the church, the sniper gallery after retrieving the documents from the soviets) are enjoyable.\n- Timing your shots with ambient noise to pick off a squad of enemies one by one without alerting the others feels good and is what this game should be about. Which leads me into the cringing:\n\nCringing:\n\n- The AI. In some points you can rock full-auto on an MP40 or a Thompson and not alert nearby enemies. Other times you can simply be jogging and every man in the city block will suddenly know where you are. Other times I had enemies round a corner and start shooting at the player character where they couldn't possibly know where he was.\n- The Weapons. There are only 2 sniper rifles in the vanilla game that are significantly different enough to be worthwhile selecting for a particular setting or mission. There doesn't appear to be any significant differences between the SMGs worth talking about. You'll probably just chose whichever the enemy in the mission will be using just for ammo availability. There is (at least in my opinion) only one pistol worthwhile using- the Welrod - as it is the only silenced weapon available. This leads me onto the cursing component:\n\nCursing:\n\n- For some reason, a game that is overtly about sniping forces the player by level design into a significant amount of close quarters fighting, particularly within tunnels and buildings. This means that the player is really limited to a single weapon (the silenced pistol) if they want to keep the stealth / infiltrator feel to the game during these sections of the level. I put this game down (about 75% of the way through the storyline) once I realised that I had spent most of the game using only the Welrod due to level design.\n\nWould I spend more than $10 on this game, no. Would I play it for a few hours if I got it for less than $10? Yes. Which I did - hence I recommend but ONLY at a significant sale price.","September 9, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most custscenes of the campaign are unecessary, and the end of every mission (MINOR SPOILERS) is literally just the main character walking out of the scene. (END SPOILERS)\n\nGameplay however is pretty addicting and I'd imagine people who enjoy the first few hours of this game would strive to become better. You don't really have many weapon-choices, however, each weapon offers a number of options for a distinct playstyle of the player's choosing; be it stealth or run and gun.\n\nI would recommend this game for the gameplay, but the campaign is on the fine line between simple or barely worked on.","July 2, 2014","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sniping is pretty much what this game is all about and it does it well, with the kill xray cam adding to the general experience. It's fun to play if you only have a couple of minutes to get you to a next checkpoint or if you have a cople of hours to actually finish the whole game in one go. Aside from that however it doesn't have much to offer, the levels are simple, straithforward and linear with pretty much only one way to finish them, still the simplicity of design does not negate the generally positive feeling of fun it provides. Co-op missions are pretty much the same as single player with few instances where one of the players is a spotter and does not have a sniper rifle. Multiplayer wise everyone is a sniper and depending on the mode selected you either kill everyone else or the enemy team. Overall a solid piece of fun especially if like me you got it for free on the 24h super special deal they had going about a month ago:)\n\n7/10","June 30, 2014","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, if you want to play it, I recomment a couple of friends to play multiplayer with.\n\nFurtheron, I like this game. amazing graphics, amazing gameplay and the multiplayer gamemodes and mechanics are also good.

The game has left pretty good impressions, third person shooter game, shooting mechanics are Solid and the game looks up-to-date graphics wise. Probably half the missions are based on stealth, you can choose any direction to approach your opponents from and devise the best strategy to take them out without being spotted. The satisfaction of X-ray Kill Cam when it hits the opponent's eye, head or any parts of the body, Co-op is the best part, when playing with your friend since you can come up with a good strategy in order to execute your plan. It takes alot of Patience and Reflex ability on the perfect time, try the demo version in steam.

I finished it in the max difficulty, and I suggest everyone to play this game like that, since it will add more strategy to the game instead of letting you kill everyone with ease. The coop mode is just awesome, if you play with a friend and a mic you can coordinate your moves and kill two enemies in a second, this adds much more fun and strategy.","June 12, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerev4r/recommended/63380/","nerev4r","255 2 Golds of Penetration","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerev4r/","80 products in account","Sniper Elite is exactly what it sounds like. You're a sniper. Most of the gameplay is being stealthy, tactical, and more often than not you're sniping.\n\nThe story in this game sucks major ♥♥♥. It's so unoriginal, there's ZERO creativity here at all. Not even the protagonist is all that great, he's dull and he really only talks during cut-scenes and before missions. He doesn't really have a character of his own, he's as thin as a piece of paper. He only acts as the person you control, and nothing more. You probably will not remember him or the game's story for that matter. The pacing is weird and the levels take you from one place to another, and I was left confused as to why he was where he was and how he gets there.\n\nWhat makes this game so badass though is the gameplay. The controls feel nice and the stealth aspect and tactics are what really make this game stand out. If you get caught, you're gonna die. Even on normal difficulty you die pretty fast. There's regenerating health but the AI is smart enough to shoot at you if they see your head peaking out over a piece of cover, so at first you will die a lot. The checkpoint system can at times be atrocious but for the most part its good.\n\nKeep in mind though that this is NOT a guns blazing shooter. You get 3 guns, one is a sniper rifle (duh),  pistol, and an assault rifle. Most enemies use sniper rifles, and pistol and assault rifle ammunition is very rare and you usually won't even have a full mag on an assault rifle (so use assault rifles only when you need to!) There's an abundance of sniper rifle ammo though but you still want to make your shots count because if you're firing like no tomorrow you will run out of ammo and you CANNOT melee enemies unless they are unaware of you (at least from my experience so far.) The gameplay is fun and surprisingly addicting and is the only reason I'm still playing this game, its just so damn fun and satisfying when you get the slow-motion bullet cam and you get to see the bullet go through your enemy and then it goes into this x-ray vision thing and shows you how the bullet travels inside the enemy's body and everything, it's a really cool and interesting feature.\n\nThe cover system is okay, but it's not as fluid as say, Watch Dogs, where you can switch from cover to cover easily. However you can change your stance in this game. You can run (or sprint with Shift), crouch, or go prone. Normal running produces a LOT of sound so you will usually be crouching. I haven't used the prone feature that much because its not particularly useful in most situations since you're usually shooting at people from vantage points with ample amount of cover.\n\nGunplay is heavily geared towards sniping. Assault rifles and pistols aren't fun to use and you'll really only use your pistol for close range kills because usually you won't have assault rifle ammo and the enemy is too close to use a sniper rifle. You can also lay down traps, these include things like dynamite, wire traps, land mines, and an infinite amount of rocks to throw to distract enemies. Apparently, Karl is an avid rock collector.\n\nSniper rifles are more complex to use. The scopes are nice, accurate and overall nice looking, and you can even see Karl's BPM and you can slow down time and it even shows you how much bullet drop there will be when aiming at a target, but once you adapt to the bullet drop you won't use this feature as much as you think you would. You cannot use this mode with any other guns except sniper rifles.\n\nThe level design accomplishes its goal, its not groundbreaking but the levels do have a good design for the style of gameplay this game is going for (which is medium-long range engagements with enemies and sniping.) You also get a Score during each mission, using the focus mode/bullet time/whatever the hell you want to call it will decrease the amount of points you get. You don't get many points for pistol, assault rifle, or melee kills. You get a lot of points by sniping, particularly getting headshots and from my testing if you get headshots in real time the score you get for that kill will increase versus if you were using the bullet time mode. You also get bonus points if you headshot a moving target or hit them in a vital spot.\n\nOverall, this game's story is a disaster but it's sniper-oriented, stealthy, tactical gameplay is so good and is very addicting. If you love sniping, this game is definitely for you. If you're not a fan of stealth games or sniping though, then the game's name should be more than enough to tell you that this game isn't for you. Oh, and the tutorial level is the most confusing, poorly designed, misleading level ever. If you can get through that nightmare the game gets better from there.","June 5, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is kind of dull and the missions are hard but the graphics and the bullet ballistics are amazing in my opinion. You can argue that the graphics aren't great but I am not one who is pampered by amazingly graphical games such as AC black flag and Watch dogs. I also really enjoy the bullet cam and the x-ray bullet views.  There are not many missions but they are long and tedious and you can't save when ever you wan't and that adds extra challenge. The stealth feature is okay but I found myself not using it often as I kept getting spotted so I can't give a review on that.\nThe story line is that you're a sniper in WW2 with the task of eliminating V2 rocket scientists. You battle through many locations of germany with a variety of rifles, pistols, smgs, and choices between trip mines and a few other traps and gadgets. For 30$ I am not so sure if its worth it but 20$ is my price range. Again I rate 8/10 because it's great but not perfect.\nEDIT: I would like to add you can shoot testicles out 10/10.","October 10, 2014","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is enjoyable and they put a lot of hard work into really letting you cherish the moment when you murder an enemy. The game looks pretty good -not excellent- and the soundtrack fits the atmosphere, or at least until it starts playing the combat music on a loop for the entire level. I only really had one problem with SniperEliteV2, that was that the game only spawned additional enemies once you had progressed further into the level. This was irritating, as I would watch an area of the mao I was about to go to, see that it was clear, and then have a dozen soldiers just kind of show up. With that said, it's not a bad game.

The is only one draw back to this game and that is the enemy will be alerted to your exact position after the first shoot. But with that being the only flaw in my eyes, put this in my top list for sniper games. Note this flaw is addressed in the next game Sniper Elite 3 along with a nice list of new features.\n\nIf you enjoy sniper missions in games like Call of Duty or Battle Field then you will love this mission with the x-ray death cams and the awsome mission layouts.

One of the things that diferentiate it from other FPS snipers is the Bullet Travel Time, and Bullet Drop, meaning that the bullet takes more time to reach it's target and will go down due to gravity. Lower dificultys make it so enemys do less damage, makes the physics less realistcs, therefore making the game easier, however, the Sniper Elite dificulty makes it so that there is more realistic physics, enemies do ridiculous amounts of damage and eliminates the little Square that marks where your bullets are going to go, and to go around that, you have a stealth mechanic, different explosive armaments to make traps or to use in direct combat, such as grenades, land mines and trip mines","June 19, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Picked it up during the free day and wanted to try it out. The campaign was alright. Quite enjoyable with different tactics despite the linear gameplay. Tutorial was annoying and unhelpful but then again most games' tutorials are anyway. I have enjoyed what I have played so far of the singleplayer despite the story not massively gripping me.\n\nThe multiplayer isn't my sort of thing. I love stealth games but only when there's something to kill. Finding players in this is pretty difficult. The multiplayer is very slow paced for such small maps. I personally prefer fast pace in small areas (TF2 sort of thing) and slower paced, more tactical in large areas (such as battlefield). I thought the maps would be quite large considering it's sniping but then again it would make it difficult to find people. The worst part was the map I played was from the campaign and I'm guessing it's the same with the others. That's something I don't like as I personally like the SP to offer a different experience from the MP.\n\nGood singleplayer, Okay multiplayer.\n\n6/10","June 20, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't honestly say that I like the story or characters so far. However, the gun play is pretty solid and seeing the kill cam and where you placed the bullet is pretty satisfying. You also have a couple of options on how you progress for a level which for me is more enjoyable than something that's linear. Also there's a survival mode for when you just feel like messing around and challenging yourself. Overall I enjoy the game and would suggest that you pick it up, though for a low to medium price.","June 28, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example, you have to move up to a certain point to get the enemies to spawn behind a corner. If you try to kill them with a grenade, before going over the trigger for the script, they are just not there and so can't be killed. So basicially you have to go into a position where they can hit you much easier. (For example the entrance of the tower with the flaks on top. The enemies won't spawn until you get onto the stairs in the corner. Without this, you could easily throw a grenage up into the hallway and take out at least half of them.)\nAnd oh yeah, they could have given the enemies a few more lines. They are always saying the same 3 or 4 sentences, sounds just a little bit stupid and annoying.\n\nBesides this, its not too bad.

As the name intends, it is Sniper Elite. However, what does this title promise for the game? It leads to exactly what it is; sniping. While this is not bad, the rest of the game is very lackluster. The maps you are set in for the campaign are very linear with very little to explore, and even if you decide to, you'll be trying to look for something to keep your interest.\n\nSniper Elite is a game full of running, shooting, and..... that's mainly it. Stealth should be a key element in a game like this, correct? Stealth only dictates whether you have an easier time or not as your rifle holds the most ammo. The designers obviously had a reason behind this, and it's in your best interest to take all the time it requires to finish one of these linear levels. The environment is uninteractive as well. The most you can do is vault over things; mainly required as it's rare you'll do this on your own.\n\nOverall, the game is boring after the first mission and is un immersive.","August 1, 2014","false","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very fun with a friend, but then again, everything is fun with a friend. The campaign can be played either single player or coop with another friend. My playtime at the time of writing this review is 4.7 hours, and that's literally the WHOLE CAMPAIGN. So, very short game, quite disappointed by that. Multiplayer is crazytown, half the time you don't know what's going on... Get insta-killed by one bullet.. Some people are crazy-good at this game.. Flags flying everywhere.. Too much for me. Also multiplayer suffers from some weird screen flickering that I didn't suffer in single-player and also LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG. I had like 15 guys with 800 lag in my matches, so that's pretty bloody bad! As usual I can't resist complaining about control issues. The game has fairly good graphics and its built pretty well but I really hate how the sensitivity of the camera changes to -9000 when you're sprinting and comes back to the normal 9000 when you're walking. It's not a "control issue" per say but an annoying little detail they put in. And that's pretty much it. It's a good game if you get it for cheap, worth putting a few hours in, and crazy fun beating your friends' score in coop mode. Hey, this is actually the first review I didn't swear in. ♥♥♥♥ me.

But it desperately needs to be reworked to fit. There will be many times within the game where you will be forced to think not as a sniper, but a Rambo style killing machine. The beginnings, half-way points, and endings will decently fit the bill as using precision skill and timing with your rifle. As in, scripted parts of the game. But in-between those key points it asks you to do things in another fashion. Such as level's two and three. In 2 you're in many tight corridors, so you have lots of straight shots. But you have zero visibility, enemies running up to you and killing you because you're on the ground, and enemies that will actually spawn before your eyes in the same tunnel. This means that your rifle is practically useless and your best choice is using your machine gun and running. Next we have level 3. Again, lots of tight corridors, low visibility, and more enemies that spawn only when you come within a certain close distance. Your only choice on any difficulty higher than the average is machine guns and running. It's a great game and I love it for its sniping parts, but it needs to be that at least most of the time, not a Call of Duty esc rampage. And I am sorry for using that comparison, but the Duty series appers to be the benchmark that the developers making this went for.","June 27, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But aside from that the game isn;t much fun. The game heavily relies on stealth which is fine execpt for the fact that you only have one silenced pistol that is hard to aim with. To continue, most of the missions are very repeatitive. Plant a bomb here and shot it. Rescue this guy. Shoot this guy after trudging through boring enimes.

Thats right, the game is really just an afterthought most of the work done has went into the fancy exploding head on xray thing that seems to make this developer think they have something.   If this was a dam fine shooter in its own right with this mechanic thrown in I would agree, however its not.   The developer must think you are going to get about 80-90% of your gameplay out of the multiplayer because the Single player is only about 5-6 hours long without DLC.   Heck even COD gives you about 10-11 hours and for full AAA price you should get about 5x more single player fun.  Gameplay is extremly linear (par for the course with a shooter) and some of the traps make the game somewhat more fun.   One major gripe is with spauning of tangos, you can be in a snipers nest and look all over the killzone and mark your targets.  Start your shooting and kill everyone.  Move foward about 5 feet and OH LOOK the game has spauned new players where they could not possibly be.   Thats right the game negates the whole planning mechanic because it cheats on spauns.\n\nI wont go on with the negatives , bottom line here is the game will keep your attention about 4-5 hours if that.  Then what little content the game has will wear out and you will move on.   Make sure you play ROCK bottom for the game, anything over 10bucks is a waste.\n\nShame","July 5, 2014","false","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did how ever have to occasionally resort to my SMG Because I was not as stealth as I hoped. Another High point in this game was the traps. Whether it was the Trip mines or land mines, there was always some sneaky place you could stash them so that when a nazi tried to flank you they would detonate one of said mines.  The DLC were alright.

However, the reason I'm not recommending it is because the game constantly crashes for me. NUMEROUS others on the official forums describe the same problem, where at a random point during a playsession, the game will hang and will not recover. I have an R9 290 (sapphire tri-x) and i5-3570. Many people have problems if using multiple monitors or multiple graphics cards. Turning off the option for "advanced shadows" lengthened the amount of time I would be able to play, but it would still inevitably crash. Despite the fact that this game has been out for years with this problem, there has been no attempt at a fix and nothing I could find online helped. I got this game for free as a part of the steam promotion, and I'm very glad I didn't pay money for this. I'm looking forward to sniper elite v3, but this time I will confirm that I'll be able to actually play the damn game this time. Since there is no way to save during missions, you will often have to replay moderate lengths of the game. Most recently when this happened, the game lost my checkpoint (even though other times it had not) and left me at the beginning of the second or third mission. This represented several hours of work, muddling through 5 or 6 crashes to get to nearly the end, only to be completely reset. I will update this review if this bug ever disappears.\n\nLook at other reviews if you want to know more about the gameplay. From what I was actually able to play, it was enjoyable. I wanted to warn people though, there weren't any reviews I saw that mentioned this crashing phenomenon.","June 24, 2014","false","52.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sniping is pretty much what this game is all about and it does it well, with the kill xray cam adding to the general experience. It's fun to play if you only have a couple of minutes to get you to a next checkpoint or if you have a cople of hours to actually finish the whole game in one go. Aside from that however it doesn't have much to offer, the levels are simple, straithforward and linear with pretty much only one way to finish them, still the simplicity of design does not negate the generally positive feeling of fun it provides. Co-op missions are pretty much the same as single player with few instances where one of the players is a spotter and does not have a sniper rifle. Multiplayer wise everyone is a sniper and depending on the mode selected you either kill everyone else or the enemy team. Overall a solid piece of fun especially if like me you got it for free on the 24h super special deal they had going about a month ago:)\n\n7/10","June 30, 2014","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very fun with a friend, but then again, everything is fun with a friend. The campaign can be played either single player or coop with another friend. My playtime at the time of writing this review is 4.7 hours, and that's literally the WHOLE CAMPAIGN. So, very short game, quite disappointed by that. Multiplayer is crazytown, half the time you don't know what's going on... Get insta-killed by one bullet.. Some people are crazy-good at this game.. Flags flying everywhere.. Too much for me. Also multiplayer suffers from some weird screen flickering that I didn't suffer in single-player and also LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG. I had like 15 guys with 800 lag in my matches, so that's pretty bloody bad! As usual I can't resist complaining about control issues. The game has fairly good graphics and its built pretty well but I really hate how the sensitivity of the camera changes to -9000 when you're sprinting and comes back to the normal 9000 when you're walking. It's not a "control issue" per say but an annoying little detail they put in. And that's pretty much it. It's a good game if you get it for cheap, worth putting a few hours in, and crazy fun beating your friends' score in coop mode. Hey, this is actually the first review I didn't swear in. ♥♥♥♥ me. That shows how many bad games I've played.","June 28, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it desperately needs to be reworked to fit. There will be many times within the game where you will be forced to think not as a sniper, but a Rambo style killing machine. The beginnings, half-way points, and endings will decently fit the bill as using precision skill and timing with your rifle. As in, scripted parts of the game. But in-between those key points it asks you to do things in another fashion. Such as level's two and three. In 2 you're in many tight corridors, so you have lots of straight shots. But you have zero visibility, enemies running up to you and killing you because you're on the ground, and enemies that will actually spawn before your eyes in the same tunnel. This means that your rifle is practically useless and your best choice is using your machine gun and running. Next we have level 3. Again, lots of tight corridors, low visibility, and more enemies that spawn only when you come within a certain close distance. Your only choice on any difficulty higher than the average is machine guns and running. It's a great game and I love it for its sniping parts, but it needs to be that at least most of the time, not a Call of Duty esc rampage. And I am sorry for using that comparison, but the Duty series appers to be the benchmark that the developers making this went for.","June 27, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sniping is different than other games as you have to take care of Air and Gravity and game forces you to play with Sniper rifle as ammo for other weapons is limited. MP is still alive and is challanging and CO-OP is one of the best specially Overwatch. Game is linear but gives you more option than others shooters, Maps are between medium to large. I was able to max out this game with my three year old HD5870 and it looks great. Gamee laks a good story and Cutscenes but game is more focused on Sniping.

I rented this game to begin with around the time it first came out, and honestly I despised it for not having the same game mechanics as the first Sniper Elite game did and returned it. Now, a couple years(ish) down the road I decided to download it for free and surprise surpise! I still hate this game just as much as I hate Sniper ghost warrior. Stealth does not play a huge factor in this game as portrayed by the developers before the release. AI dont spawn in unless you trigger an event so theres not to much long range shooting unless the mission gives you an objective to DO JUST THAT. Yeah, Xray shots cool I get it. Not so cool when the AI are shooting you through rubbled down pieces of a building so you cant shoot them as well as they can spot you when they aren't even looking at you? AI is broken in my opinon, really glad i didnt buy this game at full price. My advice, this game isnt worth $30 its not even worth $15.

However, the reason I'm not recommending it is because the game constantly crashes for me. NUMEROUS others on the official forums describe the same problem, where at a random point during a playsession, the game will hang and will not recover. I have an R9 290 (sapphire tri-x) and i5-3570. Many people have problems if using multiple monitors or multiple graphics cards. Turning off the option for "advanced shadows" lengthened the amount of time I would be able to play, but it would still inevitably crash. Despite the fact that this game has been out for years with this problem, there has been no attempt at a fix and nothing I could find online helped. I got this game for free as a part of the steam promotion, and I'm very glad I didn't pay money for this. I'm looking forward to sniper elite v3, but this time I will confirm that I'll be able to actually play the damn game this time. Since there is no way to save during missions, you will often have to replay moderate lengths of the game. Most recently when this happened, the game lost my checkpoint (even though other times it had not) and left me at the beginning of the second or third mission. This represented several hours of work, muddling through 5 or 6 crashes to get to nearly the end, only to be completely reset. I will update this review if this bug ever disappears.\n\nLook at other reviews if you want to know more about the gameplay. From what I was actually able to play, it was enjoyable.

Sniper Elite 3 immediately went on my radar after playing this.","June 26, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get a lot of content for little money and the graphics are astonishing (if you play the game on High Settings). The kill-cam is really cool, as you can see all of the bones shatter etc. A really nice touch is the emphasis on stealth. I recommened the game for Sure!","June 25, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not recommended that you use controller, KB + M works fantastically with this game, as there is somewhat of a response lag when you use your controller.\n\nIf you're a run-and-gun type, this is definitely NOT your type of game and I'd advise skipping over it.","August 10, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
