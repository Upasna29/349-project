Legend of Dungeon is an addictive romp on classic dungeon crawlers. The graphics in this mix 8- bit characters, modern day textures, and AMAZING lighting that work so well together you'll find yourself just stopping to appreciate it time and again.\nThe story is simple, you are generic adventurer A in search of treasure, and go searching a dungeon. You make your way down gaining exp as you desecend by killing monsters. The farther you go down the stronger the enimies, with it all being random each playthrough.\n\nItems give the game a good idea of how seriously you should take the game. Hats are the armour for the game. Different hats giving different stats. They can vary from a miners hat that lights up an area, to a cat helmet, to a literal cat sitting on your head and so much more. Weapons vary from all shapes and sizes. You can be very lucky with weapons, or just get nothing. I've had playthroughs where on the 5th floor obtained a Scythe that did +199 damage, and enimies were mearly targets, until a giant minatour appeared from a trap door and tossed me to the side. The only way to heal yourself is by eating apples, or finding a health potion, but potions are random depending on their color. An Aqua potion could be a health potion one game, and make you vomit the next game.\nIn the end Legend of Dungeon will always have me trying again to see if I can make it to the bottom of the dungeon. It's simple and easy on the eyes, but provides a challenge if the playthough allows it. It's a great time consumer and is definetly worth the buy.","November 22, 2014","true","23.8"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","60","67","3","1"

There’s only movement, a jump button, an action button, and a simple inventory system.\n\nBut it turns out that there’s such a variety of interesting items to use, that it’s not a simple game at all. You’ve got melee weapons, guns, spell books that can summon monsters, different hats to equip for different abilities, potions with random effects, light sources, item magnets, cats which shoot lasers from their eyes, unicorn shaped shields, and other stuff. And there’s also a massive variety of enemies, which will require different strategies to defeat or avoid.\n\nThere’s a lot of interesting ways that the entities in the game can interact with each other. For example: I summon a bunch of skeletons to defeat my foes, one of the skeletons touches a torch and is set on fire, the fire spreads to the other skeletons and eventually to me, and I burn to death.\n\nI should also mention that the lighting effects in Legend of Dungeon are amazing, especially in the dark rooms where you need to carry a light source with you. The game is best played in a dark room, for maximum atmosphere. I found the controls quite hard to master on a keyboard, but they work very well with a controller.\n\nAlso, the shield is overpowered.","June 24, 2014","true","10.1"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","56","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/238280/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Legend of Dungeon has no story whatsoever. You are simply an adventurer (or four adventurers, if you have three friends who are willing to crowd around your computer screen) attempting to reach the 26th floor of the dungeon to find and retrieve the legendary treasure there. The controls are configurable, and gamepads are supported, so a session full of yelling at three friends to give you that new helmet can be yours if you've got the hardware for it. There aren't many buttons required for each player, but I don't relish the idea of putting more than two people on the same keyboard; a gamepad just feels more natural for this game. Still, as long as one player remains alive, anyone who dies has the chance to avoid the aforementioned permadeath by collecting orbs that will bring them back to life, and that's the kind of perk that makes a little keyboard crowding feel like less of a hassle.\n\nWhether you're playing alone or with friends, randomness is the main characteristic of Legend of Dungeon. The levels are randomly-generated, as are the enemies you find there and the items you pick up along the way. In fact, although you find a rainbow's worth of potions as you progress, even those are randomized at the start of each playthrough. In one play, the inky black potion may put you to sleep, but in another, it may heal 100 HP. The game never tells you what a potion does, even if you've already tried one of that color during the current game, but the developers have hinted that this may change in a future patch.\n\nHow you feel about this chaos will almost entirely determine your overall reaction to the game. I've played it quite a few times now, and I've never reached the end, but the intrigue of what items may appear next time brings me back. Will I get a machine gun? A top hat that spews smoke like a chimney? A miner's helmet with a light for dark rooms? Or maybe something else that I've never seen before? There's no way to know, and the creativity the developers put into the items makes it fun to find out each time. Of course, the flip side is that when you don't know what you'll get, every time you play can begin to feel the same and you may feel that there's more luck involved in your success than skill.\n\nThe game's visual presentation is another element that could strike some gamers differently than others. It's an intentionally pixelated style, similar to that seen in Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery. There's no denying that it is a frequently-used style these days, and that turns some gamers off, but I think it's done well here. Legend of Dungeon's environments and enemies are all clearly defined, and the particle effects fit well with the game's overall look.\n\nLight can play a big factor in your survival, so it's fortunate that plenty of attention was focused into creating a lighting engine that works well. Some rooms are pitch black and, unless you've found an item that provides more light, you must inch forward and watch for any hint of a monster coming near your tiny pool of visibility. And even if you have your own light, is it a helmet, or is it something you'll have to carry in your hands instead of a weapon? Is that worth the risk?\n\nThe sounds of enemies play a similar role in your survival, particularly in those dark rooms. Each type makes a distinct noise when they notice you and come to attack, and you quickly begin to recognize common foes. This helps not just in dark rooms, but in knowing how to time your attacks in any room where you're facing a number of enemies. There is no voice acting and only occasional, but perfectly serviceable, music. This might be a negative in some games, but in this one the crucial need to hear the monsters makes the lack of constant music a good thing.\n\nLegend of Dungeon is fun to play, but it's a game that you're unlikely to actually finish without trying a great number of times. And since you can't save your game, each attempt is a fresh start. The question is whether you'll continue to enjoy the game's randomness long enough to attempt it that many times. As for me, it's the kind of game I find myself thinking about when I'm not playing it; making plans for the next round; trying to decide what I could do better and how to progress farther. I'd rate that as a pretty good indicator of success for any game.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","December 27, 2014","true","27.0"," 57 of 69 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","57","69","2","0"

But in the Rift you can see the whole level in true 3d from any angle just by moving your head. It's like the game is an animated diorama or board game.

You can only move and do one type of sword attack, and use items such as apples to refill your health. The level art is always the same no matter what dungeon floor you are on. The game lacks a good inventory system for the tons of items you pick up. Your only way of switching items is cycling through them in a long list.\n\nThe little art that appears in the game is fantastic, and the music is great too.\n\nIt might be more fun as a co-op game, but you can only play local co-op. I'm not sure who does that on PC. For some reason the pre-release videos of this game made me assume that you had a party of AI heroes, but that is not the case.\n\nOverall, feels a bit half-baked, like an early access title. The game has no back story or lore, it is like an Atari game with pretty graphics. Could be great with some more features such as block and roll commands, real inventory system, and changing dungeon art design every few floors. Needs a save system too. I played for awhile yesterday, came back today and my progress was nowhere to be found.\n\nEdit: After playing the game some more I managed to have a decent run until the game crashed on Level 7. Still not sure I could recommend it yet, but that was the most fun I had with it. Got a badass fire sword and upgraded the hell out of it at the random blacksmith. Also had a magic item that summoned a dark warrior to fight for me. Pretty cool. Realllly needs a quicksave system like Dungeons of Dredmor so you can stop and come back to that point later. I don't have the time to sit down and try to run through all at once.","December 1, 2013","false","1.3"," 192 of 319 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","192","319","0","1"

If your looking for a cool indi-game like I was, this one is not bad, worth the sale price. One thing to mention the the fighting system uses a "negative edge" style attack, where your character attacks when you release the button, took me a bit of time to realize, although I improved, I still thought this to be difficult to time the release of button while in the heat of battle. Also, the "streets of rage" perspective is a bit awkward to judge where you are in space but that's whats kinda cool about it too.

It's FUN: my #1 reason for playing games.\n\nThe goal sounds simple: start in the tavern, work your way down to the 26th level, get the treasure, and bring it back up to the tavern, and you win. Simple, right? HA!\nHa!\nNope.\nI usually play this game late in the evening, after I've done everything for the day and am winding down. I can't beat it, I can't even get close to beating it, but I enjoy every moment playing it. When I die, then I go to bed. ;-)\n\nLegend of Dungeon is colorful and gorgeous. The pixel art style here is well drawn & attractive. The colored lighting of effects, with light sources & real-time shadows vault what might have been an "ordinary" pixel art game of the '90s into a beautiful, 21st century game.\n\nIt combines the randomly generated levels/rooms/monsters/objects of a rogue-like with a classic "beat 'em up" style of movement & gameplay which I enjoy more than normal 2-D side-scrollers or classic top-down games.\nThe neat quirks of this game keep it interesting. Everything's randomly generated, even the color of the potion bottles to their effects; different every game. The swing of your melee weapons need to be timed well to hit your enemy best: you don't just button mash. Spellbooks that shoot flaming skulls or spawn monster companions mix up your strategy as you go, as do rare projectile weapons. A spray paint can will help you mark your path on walls (or just vandalize the walls!). Sometimes you get a room with so many baddies, or really wicked ones, that the only thing you can do is RUN! Or get lucky and find a path of rooms around.\n\nI really enjoy playing the Daily generated dungeon, and this is the only game where I've cared to know where my score ranks world-wide.\n\nIf I had to use 1 word to describe Legend of Dungeon: FUN.\n2 words?

I got this game as part of a games bundle and tried on several occasions to 'get into it' but couldn't. All the time while playing it I couldn't help but feel there are much better Dungeon Crawling RPGs out there, granted, rogue-like games aren't for everyone but I've enjoyed other rogue-like games in the past so I don't think that was a contributing factor.\n\nI want go get something straight, Legend of Dungeon isn't necessarily a bad game, it's just average. There is nothing about this game (aside from the price) that would make it worth playing over the dozens of better dungeon-crawlers out there.  Local co-op might spark interest in this the game for some players but I didn't have the opportunity to try it myself.\n\nThe overall objective in the game is a bit underwhelming; in the main room of the tavern the barkeeper gives you your one and only quest. It is as basic as saying 'LEGEND HAS IT: there is a treasure on level x'. At the moment there don't appear to be any side quests, just the one sparse main one which is somewhat understandable considering Legend of Dungeon's Rogue-like nature. Still, it doesn't motivate me to explore the dungeons any which I consider a fail.\n\nThe graphics are fine - if you like pixel art; if you don't like pixel art you will think you are playing a port of a game from the early nineties. The music is pretty contemporary, not 8 bit like the graphics, and overall adds to the ephemeral joys of Rogue-like spelunking.\n\nI find the combat somewhat hit and miss, despite the fact that Legend of Dungeon is a side scrolling dungeon crawler there are in fact several dimension you can move through meaning that if you want to strike an enemy you will need to align yourself with your enemy's dimension, otherwise your attacks are ineffective.\n\nDespite the fact that your character can gain levels there isn't a whole lot of attribute customization that can be done, certain attributes increase but you can't specialize your character and once your character dies you loose everything. I think it would be nice if you could keep at least one item from your past adventurers for the start on future ones. Just to give the game a better feeling of progression.\n\nIn one playthrough, after leaving and then reentering the Tavern, I was unable to head back down into the dungeon. Try as I would, nothing happened when I moved toward the first level down the stairs. This meant I had to restart, thereby loosing over 30 minutes of progress.\n\nThe Good:\n+ The music complements the game well\n+ Local co-op makes the game more enjoyable overall\n+ Legend of Dungeon has sufficient depth (combat system, magic, etc)\n+ Developer made an effort, the Steam version has trading cards and Steam Achievements\n\nThe Bad:\n- Combat feels clunky\n- There are some really frustrating bugs that should never happen (see above)\n- Pixel-art characters and levels don't inspire me\n- bland copy/paste quests\n- Outdated and lacking the originality to compensate for it, this game could've been released 15 years ago and you probably wouldn't know the difference.\n\nIn conclusion: I would really like to recommend this game but as I am not motivated to play it myself I cannot really suggest it to others. If you pick it up on sale I'd give it try, maybe you'll like it or have a friend/family member who is interested in playing co-op with you for an afternoon.","June 3, 2014","false","2.2"," 69 of 113 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","69","113","0","0"

(one click button attack, hold to do power attack) There is a fair few weapons to come across from the mighty code hammer to the speedy coffee mug. There's also some pretty cool easter eggs from some of my favorite movies and games that i won't spoil.\n\nThere is a really decent amount of different monsters to encounter too, from bats, annoying as hell goblins and slimes to minotaurs, cyclopes, Succubs and the crazy OP lich king. The randomization of this game is really well done too, it actually feels like luck based randomization unlike other rouge-likes/lites which you are more or less guaranteed to get better loot straight after spawn. On one playthrough I walked out of the bar/pub onto the first floor and got destroyed straight away by a cyclops, then on another run I found the code hammer on floor 3 and got to level 19.\n\nPlus the lighting, colors, interesting pixel art is like the cherry on top for me.","March 31, 2014","true","49.3"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

Every time you play, it is a different dungeon.  It is never the same dungeon unless  you input the same seed. The objective of this game, you need to navigate your way down to level 26 to grab a treasure and bring it back to level 0 to complete the game.   You will come across a variety of monster mobs and 7 different bosses to kill.  Once you grab a treasure at level 26,  heading back to level 0, you'll find difficult mobs existing at all levels.  This is identical to Impossible mode except it is not that way at start. The difficulty of this game is relatively easy (considering my guide) but there is Impossible mode where you'll deal with potential powerful monster mobs right away starting Level 1 instead of deep in the dungeon.\n\nThe drawbacks of this game I have found to be is that there are too many hats that often are useless.  You can find a hat at beginning of the game and still use the same one despite coming across 20 hats before finally finding a better one so late in the game.  I would like to have some kind of consistency that let me see weaker equipments at beginning and gets better every next level.  Another drawback,  the coloring of potions (about 10 different colorings)  are random.  Which means, you have to drink them all first to figure out what each potion do.   a Dark Violet potion might have given you +100 health last game but next game could be anything but that.  That can be annoying for anyone who disagree with that feature.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is interested in having a casual fun out of a dungeon-crawler game.  You will enjoy a "different" game every time you start one.   This meant your experience of this game will be unique every time.   I would rate this  between 6.5 to 7 out of 10.   This would have been higher if it was not for the disappointment of not being able to play multiplayer via internet.   Multiplayer is possible only via local coop.  By local, you have to have 1-3 friends with you playing on the same screen.

Yes, the graphics are gorgeous but the gameplay is just too basic. You play it as a sidescroller, killing enemies. You're thrown into the game without any explanation so it's all up to you to discover what to do. Enemies don't have health bars so you have no idea if you're actually hurting them. And there are so many doors that sometimes you have no idea where to go next. Or you might just be walking around in circles looking for a certain specific secret. Items have no description so except for a few basic and obvious things (like apples and swords) you have to figure things out all by yourself. A challenge is cool, but if you're gonna do stuff like that you better first explain the basic rules. This is exactly where Legend Of Dungeon fails. The end result feels like a boring mess.\n\nExcept for the lovely graphics I wouldn't recommend this game right now. There are so many other, better roguelike games like this. And you should definitely play those first.\n\n[Rating: 68/100]","September 22, 2013","false","3.4"," 43 of 75 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","43","75","0","1"

The game plays much like Binding of Isaac MIxed with Castle Crashers, but less polished than both. The game has no built in controller support and the menus are hard to navigate. In a game where the main gameplay mechanic is fighting, it amazes me that it is so poor. It is hard to hit eneimies  and you get damaged to often because there is basicly no way to really doge enimies when you are attacking. The inventory is clunky and items arent explained very well. Alot of the time hats that add "special abilities" don't seem to do anything noticable.\n\nAfter reading that paragraph you probably think I hate this game, I don't.

It is used to excellent effect, has fantastic lighting and particle effects which fit perfectly with the art direction.\nSound and music are atmospheric without being overbearing.\nIn the tradition of procedural generation, the dungeon is never the same, but this does not just extend to the setting.  Potions are labelled with their color (and sometimes random adjectives) and have random effects.  Items are random as well – I once had a coffee mug as a hat, until I switched it out for a deer’s head.\nOther randomness includes the appearance of random characters, including a Doctor Who (complete with phone booth).  And random weapons – not just swords but spells and guns.  It’s all random, really.\nIncludes both friend and global scoreboards – on the Global, I have yet to crack the top thousand… :(\nThis game is a true labor of love – even the game company name, Robot Loves Kitty, comes from the nicknames these two lovers have for one another.  Joystiq did a fantastic write-up of the money-saving methods this couple went through to pursue their dream of game development (http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/09/legend-of-dungeon-devs-secret-to-saving-money-live-in-a-tree/) and deserves your money on that merit alone.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nOne of the issues which plagues almost every game in which combat is engaged on a 2d plane within a 3d environment – hit detection can be problematic because you have to be in line with your target.  This is an issue which harkens back to the great 2D brawlers like Final Fight and Double Dragon.\nSome of the levels get rather dark, but since item and equipment drops are randomized, you can’t be sure of having a source of light in order to explore them.\nThis game is screaming for an online co-op mode – which for all I know may be forthcoming.  I would love to share this experience with a friend, descending into the darkness.\n\nCan you play it while the children are awake?:\n\nSure, it’s pretty harmless stuff.  Nothing more graphically violent than, say, their Saturday morning cartoon.\n\nWhile I’m picking nits…\n\nWhat will they call the company if these two break up?  “Robot despises Kitty”? “Robot is no longer speaking to Kitty”? “Kitty caught Robot with another feline”? Also, how has no one drawn the obvious analogy to Data and Spot?\n\nDid I make time to complete it?:\n\nI have not yet made it to the 26th floor (which is supposedly the end) but I expect to at some point.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\n$9.99.

Not like that annoying Spelunky "screw up for even a fraction of a second and you're dead" hard, but still quite challenging.  I've yet to complete a single run successfully.  It's maddening.\n\nSo why do I keep coming back and playing it over and over?\n\nReally, I can't figure it out.  You'd think a game where you consistently get your [insert body part here] handed to you by various dungeon monsters would get old and demoralizing, but if anything I find myself even more energized after a particularly (relatively) successful run that ends in failure.  Before I know it I'm pressing start and exploring yet another randomly generated dungeon.\n\nIt might be the loot. While variety isn't huge, there's enough that you are never quite sure what you're going to pick up, whether you're going to have a highly defensive run, snap up a hugely powerful weapon, or maybe get your hands on some of the more fun utility equipment like bunny ears for high-jump fun.  Every so often you get little to nothing in the way of good loot, but that's quite rare.\n\nIt could also be the gameplay itself.  Simple controls, sprite-style block renders presented in a fixed perspective, and a randomly generated 26-level dungeon filled with monsters, treasure, switches, secret passages, and all sorts of other fun things.  If you're okay with the graphics style, the inner explorer in you should be quite satisfied.\n\nThere's also the light tongue-in-cheek campy tone the game sets throughout the dungeon. Yes, there are scary monsters that can kill you in a heartbeat if you aren't careful, but (for example) a Vampire might utter a cliche chiptune-rendered "blah" as he reconstitutes after turning into a bat swarm and gibbing you.  There's also the matter of the cats which inexplicably populate the dungeon, and which at times can functions as inventory, armor (hats, specifically), or even weapons.  Cat weapons, you ask?  One (hyphenated) word, my friend: Laser-cats.\n\nAbout the only bad thing I can say about this game is not bad so much as a missed opportunity: the game has co-op play, but it's local co-op only, as in everyone playing on the same computer with different controllers.  The game makes the most of this by allowing you to completely customize controls for each player, up to and including having multiple players use different sections of the keyboard to play for people lacking enough USB controllers.  Still, it's not as convenient as having each person able to play at separate computers - and more importantly, separate monitors.\n\nRegardless of why it's fun, the fact remains that this game is fun.  I'm not going to devote a huge amount of my time to it or anything, but It's one of my many go-to games when I have a little time to kill and no particular desire to play something with a complicated plot or with much tactical thinking required.  Go down stairs to dungeon, kill baddies, grab loot, lather, rinse, repeat, wipe hands on pants.  Beautiful simplicity.","April 3, 2015","true","9.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluJaguar/recommended/238280/","BluJaguar","BluJaguar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluJaguar/","86 products in account","This is a game full of great humor, beautiful artwork and lighting effects, amazing dynamic music, scary monsters, challenge, and surprises.  The premise is simple; like many roguelikes you need to travel to the bottom of the dungeon, and return with the treasure.  Each level is randomly generated, so the game is never the same twice.  The monsters generally get tougher the lower you get, but they are also mostly random, so keep an eye out for death, even on level 1.  There are only two equipment slots, what's in your hand, and what's on your head.  Since the head is the only dedicated armor slot, this means hats.  Lots and lots of hats.\n\nThe dungeon wants to kill you, and will almost always succeed.  About half the time it will be monsters you are unequipped to handle showing up unexpectedly. Some of the time it will be mistimed jumps into lava or a trap crushing you to death.  Almost always it will be because of an item you see that you want so badly to get, be it gold coins, a potion, a dragon helm, or a sword of 5k blades.  Overconfidence makes up the rest of dying.  Often the dungeon will spawn a very powerful item early in the game, allowing descent through the upper floors with reckless abandon and prompting the player to rush headlong into monsters they can't handle.\n\nWhile the game is not yet finished, it is ceratinly worth buying.  The upcoming patch (Version,  Tormentor) adds a couple of hotkeys for easier inventory management, dungeon seeds for reproducable dungeons, daily dungeons with a hi-score archive on Tumblr, game saving, and an 'impossible mode' for those of us who think the game is too easy to beat.  The future holds free updaets to add pets and character classes, so there's a lot to look forward to!\n\nThe only drawback is that there is no online multiplayer, but there is something to be said for actually meeting up with friends to play games.  Be aware however, while it's technically up to four player co-op, projectile weapons can still hurt your friends, and so can pushing them into enemies or lava.\n\nRight now I give the game an 8/10, and once all of the updates are out, I'm sure that will be at least a 9/10; with infinite replayability, you can't get much better entertainment value for the dollar than Legend of Dungeon.","November 29, 2013","true","145.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Hard to say; I think I'll be pretty much done with it in single-player after I do my first successful completion of the game.

Don't let the pixelated look fool you. The way the devs use color and light (especially) makes this game really stand out from an aesthetic stand-point. There is always something flashing or glowing or light coming from something you have equiped and it all adds up to give the game a truly unique look. To top it all off, the sound effects compliment the aesthetics perfectly and you end up with a totally emersive experience.\n\nThe gameplay is just as pleasing as the design. The controls are tight and responsive and are set by the user before you even attempt your first run. There is a nice variety of weapons and hats (which act as your defensive equips) and it's always  fun finding that new weapon that does massive damage or that new hat that makes your run faster or jump higher or whatever. Being a rogue-like, no 2 runs are ever the same and this random aspect gives the game possible endless replayability.\n\nThis game is still in beta and the devs are constantly adding new content. There are now different classes (i.e., knights, rogues, mages etc) and a new pet system which I'm just starting to really get to know. I'll update this review once I get a better feel for it all or the game hits it's final release.\n\nAs it stands now, this game is an easy 9/10 for me and absolutely worth the small price. This is one of the rare games that makes me want to buy copies for my friends just so they can experience it for themselves and to also help the devs and hopefully encourage them to keep up the amazing work. This game is a perfect example of everything that is right about indie gaming.","March 29, 2015","true","23.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It handles pretty smoothly, the RNG keeps things fresh, and it's beautiful in both sound and graphics. Secondly, there's a surprising amount of depth in the items and the difficulty of the game. Enough to keep me coming back repeatedly.\n\nPeople keep citing Binding of Isaac as inspiration for/similar to this game, but I see more of Dungeon Stone Crawl Soup than anything else here. The randomized dungeons, the similar amount of floors, the similar goal. The only real Binding of Isaac-esque thing I see in this game is the descrepincy between it being "Rogue-like", as Stone Crawl Soup is, and being "Rogue-lite" as Binding of Isaac is.\n\nThe starter class is utterly terrible and it is, from my experience, a decent amount of work to unlock the other classes. Some enemies are utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and often I get hit when I can't clearly see why. There's little direction on why you do what you do or even what your overarching goal is(Or, at least I wasn't entirely sure until my third go around.) While I enjoy how obscure the game is on item and equipment effects, I feel it can also work to it's detriment at times, as the menu, to me, seems rather unintuitive and uninformative, which served to make me frustrated at first.\n\nOverall, I'd give the game an 8/10 and will definitely keep watching this game as it updates.","March 29, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(real, fleshy friends, that is- no online play...)\n\npositives: Fairly simple gameplay is made enjoyable and rewarding by the genuinely impressive variety of weapons, hats, and gizmo's available, and the rouge-like elements keep things nice and fresh. One play through you'll be keeping track of the bullets left in your revolver, each one a precious resource- the next you'll be madly summing armies of skeletons, to fight mages madly summining armies of skeletons right back at you! There is an undeniable sense of glee in finding a new weapon, trying it out on a passing snake or bat, and seeing some crazy new mechanic you never new existed oblitorate your unfortunate target- realising I now had the power to shoot lazers from my eyes was a particually enjoabyle moment!\nThe game sports a variety of modes for different moods. As well as a standard dungeon crawl, you have the option for fully randomized dungeons that don't scale in difficulty to your progress, 'nightmare' dungeons for the experienced delver, and of course the rouge-like standard of a 'daily dungeon'. Each mode comes with it's own leaderboards, lending a competative edge to the game- nothing rewards a good run quite like landing a place in the all-time leaderboards!\nThe graphics are suprisingly lovely too- the '3D space, 2D pixel sprites' look is an interesting one, certainly, and the creatures are all represented well in both appearence and sound design. (if you aren't slightly saddened by the 8bit whimper of a long dead ghost as it dies a second death, you might not be human yourself)\n\nDownsides: There is the occasional sense of missed oppertunity with some of the mechanics. The puzzle elements (such as fire traps, hidden walls, and moving staircases) are very limited in their functionality due to the procedural level design- you will never find your path blocked by a fire wall, and have to venture deeper into the dungeon to disable it. Instead, firewalls feel as if they are placed a little haphazzardly, and their activators are never located outside of the room they are found in.\nAlso, of course, it's not for everyone- if deep combat mechanics (as apposed to varied), narrative complexity, or cutting edge graphics are important to you, then this obviously isn't going to be your cup of tea. But to be honest, "does its own thing, really quite well, isn't going to please everyone" is hardly a downside!\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the impressive effort put in to the procedural music- each time you enter the dungeon, enemies and objects are assigned a layer of music on some pseudo-random basis, and these layers will then meld together as you play, depending on what's on screen. The fact that such an interesting system even functions is impressive, let alone sounds good- all hail intellegent collaboration between indie devs and indie musicians!!!","April 28, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Honestly you can just bop most enemies if you pay attention to item damage, and if you use a seed you can end up getting some pretty ridiculous health/items going on. I can't even see this game being more fun with friends.\n\nMost dungeon-type crawlers have some sort of objective, vague or no. Legend of Dungeon tosses you into a very tiny, repetetive, easy-mode with no semblance of a goal except to tediously attempt to find the staircase to go lower. For what?\n\nEDIT: someone commented to let me know of the goal of the game: reach the 26th level.\nUnfortunately I think the game is so dry and boring that I can't even IMAGINE trying to through that much of it.\n\nPerhaps the most irritating thing about this game is the way you end up relying on secret doors which makes a tedious boring game even more tedious and boring, somehow.\n\nI lied.

I found it to be quite cute. Other than that, I found the game itself rather lacking in gameplay.\n\nThe core game consists of fighting your way through monsters to go further and further down accessed by stairways towards the 26th floor. Reaching your way towards the 26th floor, you take the treasure there and are tasked with bringing it back to the 1st level without dying. As one could assess, this game has perma death. So once you die you start from the 1st floor.\n\nAs I continued to play, what I found with the game was the combat was simply uninsteresting and not fun. Melee attacks were of one motion, being swung downwards regardless of any type of melee weapon you picked up. Magic items were of a similar type being thrown as a skull with the same animation (nevertheless cute). There are no skills or abilities to be used.\n\nThe lack of variety of items were also disappointing. After awhile I realized most items I came across seem very similar to another I had just picked up. Simply a variant skin with -/+ attributes. The loot you picked up were either weapons, potions, or hats. Hats and weapons were the only equipable items. Loot itself was in a sense unsatisfying. Though again, the redeeming qualities of the art was something to be reckoned with. All the hats were either ridiculously funny and/or adorable.\n\nAfter ample time of getting used to and understanding what Legend of Dungeon had to offer, it turned into a game without much substance. I was disappointed to see that the game offered much less then I initially thought. Legend of Dungeon is by no means a bad game, but neither is it good.

Very humorous and tounge-in-cheek, it's a fun little game that I play casually when I haven't the time or patience for something heavier. You start in a tavern with a dungeon beneath, and weak and poorly geared you descend into a 26-level labyrinth with progressively nastier monsters and cooler loot as you go. YOU WILL DIE. A LOT. I have enjoyed the game a great deal, but doubt I may successfully complete the quest -- though I know it CAN be done! Enemies are varied and there is much to learn about how to handle (or avoid) each of them. Skill, luck, and using what you're given are big factors. Game is cute, but unforgiving, though you can play several lives like munching potato chips. That Devil that summons armies of demons can be shot in the face with a revolver. That cyclops can be lured into a pit of lava. That Party-hat might have better stats, but you still should keep your mining helmet for when it gets dark. That potion may make you barf rainbows, or give you needed healing. The Scythe you got for killing the grim reaper is awesome, but you can't scrape the dozen zombie hands that are tying you down with it. Did I really find a giant fire-sword on level 2? Omg, DROIDS? I am shooting ghosts... with a CAT? (all of these are thoughts I've had while playing this game.)

I kept collecting coins and random bits of stuff, I ran around beating things with my sword wondering what to do with my loots. Then I died in a firey pool of lava and game over. That is when I realized, this game is awesome! The point wasn't to get things, it was to adventure as far as you could and get as much loot as you could, then die and do it agian, trying to get more and go farther! Its an awesome game! Putting a fish on your head as a protective item was grand sillieness, as is the whole game, its just a fun game when you get the idea of it. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone! It is a good time killer, that doesnt frustrate you when you die. The character selection is pretty sweet too. Walk into the bathrooms in the tavern and walk out a new man, or woman, just great!\n\nPlay this game, enjoy it for what it is!

Disregard the negative reviews lamenting the lack of a save option. Like Spelunky, the thrill of this game is precisely in the challenge of navigating a randomized world in one shot. The variety of weapons, hats and potions -- and there are a lot of them -- can significantly altar your game experience, and some of the effects are a little zany. I am hoping for a little more environmental interaction (a la Spelunky's idols and boulders) in future builds.

Don't let the first few levels fool you -- the game is hard! While others might complain that the mechanics are too easy, the reality is that you need to minimize the damage you get from even basic monsters if you'll have any hope of reaching the treasure. The skill in this game is knowing your enemies well: knowing which enemies to avoid, which to run away from, and how to hit the rest of them without getting hit in return. The graphics are a marvelous mix of old and new, with truly beautiful lighting effects, and the music is incredibly good (far better than what I'm used to in this genre).\n\nA few downsides:\n1. There isn't enough randomness or variety in the dungeon layouts. Compared to Spelunky where levels feel mostly original each time, the dungeon levels here feel repetitive. This is balanced out by the fact that the dungeon levels aren't the main source of randomness here -- the monsters and items are.\n2. Summoned monsters are too easy to abuse via spamming. I really wish the dev would do something about this. Basically, once you get a summoning spell, you can spam critters in every room, killing the monsters and preventing you from getting hit.\n\nRegardless, this is a great game and if you liked Spelunky & FTL, there's a good chance you'll like this one as well.","December 23, 2013","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Roguelike, this is one of those games that has that edge of your seat madness we all crave when it comes to gaming these days. A visual assasin with controller smashing delight, Legend of Dungeon is genius.\n\nI often browse through games that are soon to be released so I can see what I might want to add to my wishlist, anything indie or retro always seems to catch my eye, and this was a perfect candidate. Seeing as the game was still in beta, I usually try not to get too involved before the final product is released. This way, it doesn’t taint my vision of what the developers intend the game to be when its complete. So, with that being said, one half drunken night after coming home from the bar I just said “♥♥♥♥ it.”\n\n“Legend has it there is a treasure on the 26th floor…” IF you ever get there that is. Your goal in Legend of Dungeon is to make it to the 26th floor where you will battle your way through hordes of zombies, demons, bats, and creatures that you would only see in your wildest nightmares. Multiple weapons, magic, power ups, coins and don’t forget HATS will help you battle your way to the 26th floor, and trust me, you WILL need them. This is definitely not a simple playthrough by any means. The randomized bosses are a challenge and can quickly become a problem, but make sure you defeat each you come across for special item drops.\n\nAddicting within the first 2 minutes, I’d say clear the next 2 hours of your schedule, or even better yet the next 2 days. Graphicly, the visual intensity of this game is amazing. Brilliant lighting mixed in with perfect shading makes this game not only fun to play but fun to watch as well. Legend of Dungeons soundtrack has an old school feel with a modern touch and is almost like a electronic opera filled with emotion. These two elements combined with a flawless attention to detail make for an awesome gaming experience.\n\nThis game is loaded with all types of different weapons, potions and again HATS, lots and lots of HATS. Weapon wise, you begin with a sword, and throughout the game pick up different weapons as you go. With everything from a flare gun, pistol, saber, lasers that shoot out of your eyes, lasers that shoot out of a CATS eyes, magic spells, and even a lantern, you are well suited when it comes to taking on this castle. Hats make up the brunt of your armor and can range from a normal piece of headgear like a turban, to the outrageous, like a beehive or koala bear. Each hat has a different stat booster, and can sometimes help light the path in a dark area. Potions also make up a large part of the game and can do anything from raise your health and stats, to making you act like a drunken single girl at a bachelorette party. Sometimes, more often than not it’s very unclear what the potions do but like most drugs, you always gotta try it once, right?\n\nReplay factor isn’t a problem when it comes to Legend of Dungeon. You feel like you have something to accomplish, and you just don’t feel complete until you do. I love games like this that when everytime you die you come back with avengence, setting goals to achieve while trying to surpass your last attempt at glory. Don’t worry about getting bored with the dungeons either. They change with every game and are randomized, and this makes each attempt better than the last.\n\nEvery element of Legend of Dungeon seems to amaze me, and I can’t get enough. Enough can’t be said about the brilliant lighting and vibrant colors, the intense and emotional music, or the edge of your seat game play that is experienced with each run. Legend of Dungeon is an automatic hit, and can only get better.

I think what draws me in most, is the music and the overall build of the game. 2D pixel characters and enemies within a 3D environment. It's very unique and beautifully done. The lighting as well as the shadows are very well done and I love the overall feel of the game. The items are fun to find, enemies fun to kill, rooms fun to explore. And the best part...it gets progressively harder to stay alive as you descend the floors. There is no saving and that's what makes it so challenging. If you die, you'll have to start over and try again. The dungeons are randomly generated mind you, but that's what makes it fun and different each and every time you play it. It's also a great time killer if you have nothing else to do.\n\nAll in all though, I love love LOVE this game.

Yes its all a little rose tinted, and yes, most of those very same older games back in the 80s were quite terrible but amongst all that bedroom coded dross there were some startling games. This game, reminds me of those.\n\nIts fun, difficult, hectic, random and annoying in that "one more go!" way, everything a game should be in my eyes. The graphics, whilst obviously pixelated for either style or fitting in with the current spree of retro looking games, are good and work well. The lighting is very good and adds a decent atmosphere to the game.\n\nThe music, something those afore mentioned 80s games lacked unless you enjoyed the plink, plink of chip tunes is excellent and again adds to the enjoyment and atmosphere of the game.\n\nIt has simplistic gameplay and the fighting will never really tax anyone but the point is, it isn't meant to. This is dungeon crawling, looting and roguelike. You are supposed to die, you are supposed to hit and run and not use a cover mechanic. Its basic gameplay done right.\n\nI have yet to play the local multiplayer but the singleplay experience is as described above. As a fan of local MP I can only look forward to having 2-3 of us battle away instead of my solo fight. Sadly it is lacking online MP, which would have been a bonus for myself and mates but don't let that put you off if you are after experiencing something like Legend of Dungeon.\n\nGreat game.","December 22, 2013","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While the music, graphics, and overall style are exemplary and delightful, the gameplay style encourages an exceedingly cautious, grindy, and overall slow-paced crawl through repetitious, maze-like dungeon floors. The 'action' elements are often quirky in mechanical terms, and even a skilled player with great items will die on lower floors unless they haltingly work their way past enemies to keep their health from being whittled down. In short, Legend of Dungeon requires a great deal of patience, but players who are willing to sit and watch enemy movements for hours will be rewarded with the hope of survival. That hope, however, is unwarranted: a randomly horrifying layout on the next floor may still cut their adventure short.","April 30, 2014","false","16.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

YOU'RE GONNA DIE SO HARD YOU'LL FORGET YOU WERE TRYING TO REACH THE TREASURE ON THE 26TH LEVEL OF THE DUNGEON.\n\nThe thing that sucks about real life is that you can only die once and no matter how awesome you go out, that's it - there goes your one shot.

You've experienced so little that life can offer that you can't even fathom the best way to make a best last impression.\n\nLet Legend of Dungeon inspire you. Beat a warlock's face in before you go. Smack a cat (seriously, try it once). Run with a cup of coffee screaming in to a pit of lava. Drink questionably yellow fluids you find. Vomit blood. Worship Satan. Watch some *sshole turn in to dozens of bats - swat them all down for those glorious shiny green balls (XP).\n\nMost importantly, don't read a guide.

What the game needs is a better way to manage your invitory, possibly by using hotkeys for quick action and more enjoyment. The level design is well...a dungeon but it's not even a cool dungeon. The levels all look the same and can get boring really quickly. I think with the ability to save progress, a better invitory system+hotkeys, and different looking levels, this game would be well worth the $10. Right now I'd say it's worth about $5 maximum and the only reason I bought it was anticipation/the low price.\n\nThe fact is that most of the negative reviews are accurate which is sad considering how awesome this game can look before you purchase it. I'm sure since the game barely just released on steam there will be plenty of DLC content to come in the future. I just hope they fix the key areas I mentioned above.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone who likes to save their progress and expects the gameplay features to mirror it's graphic design. The bottom line is: if you are looking for a dungeon crawler that's balanced between casual and exciting, this game is for you. Otherwise, try something else.","December 3, 2013","true","2.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The movement works like a street brawler, You can move closer and further to the screen. The thing i do truly love about this game however is when you can gather items and they have stats. These stats can be stacked to an absurd amount however, You can get a coffee cup, wear it as a hat, and suddenly you are running so fast you cant control yourself, or you can improve your jump so that you rocket to the roof every time. It also does have procedurally generated dungeons, randomly generated enemies and randomly generated loot.\n\nThis game does have some annoyances however, It seems success can be quite random. Getting down to the lower levels is heavily based on the gear you have and sometimes you can find really crappy gear, or really awesome gear. Also the controller configuration is very annoying, But havent seen any noticable bugs, so thats a plus.\n\nAnother thing this game has going for it, it the local co-op. You can play with up to four friends and can get quite entertaining. However no online co-op is available and when you die, getting back in the game can be very problematic, especially since most of the time when you die, you fall in lava or something, so you lose all the gear you had on you.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is pretty entertaining, but very random, and can be better with friends.\n\n7.5/10 Alone\n8/10 with friends","March 20, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Additionally, I forgot to mention that this game has strong potential to be a great game.\n\nWorst 1.50 I ever spent. The sheer lack of diversity in items and combat make this game the epitome of ♥♥♥♥. Furthermore, the lack of a somewhat decent menu, displaying your inventory or character stats, make dungeon dwelling within this game meaningless. Further down the dungeon lies an atrocious pile of crap. The settings in which the developers have created are pure garbage. Rebinding keys is a chore and there isn't even a 'Restore to default' button. But hold on, you are forced to rebind keys since the tutorial is non-existant. There is absolutely no explanantion on the controls whatsoever. Makes me think whether or not the developers are plain idiots or apes.\n\nWhile I have listed all the negatives of the game, it does, however, succeed in specific areas of gaming. I guess this dungeon crawling piece of dung can still be fun when played in the vincinity of friends. Button mashing alongside people you love (not that way ;)) is sure a lovely sight. Nevertheless, the Legend of Dungeon is hardly worth your money or time. It's obvious the developers haven't thought of how to execute their concepts properly, in addition to building an user friendly tutorial and menu. Just like Hammerwatch, this game is a slap in the face to nostalgia.","December 22, 2013","false","4.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Even though comparing this little game to great titles such as Rogue, Nethack, Dwarf Fortress is just mean, this game could at least have vaguely followed their footsteps (which - if you catch my drift - it clearly didn't)\n\nThe game has cosy visuals, easy-to-understand combat mechanics, easy-to-understand inventory system and a basic stat system, but that's about it.\n\nLet me put it this way: there are people who play games to experience the story, immersion, challenge, content and may prioritize dozens of other aspects. I'm simply a person who enjoys the intricate (and well implemented) systems that games have to offer as well as the challenge curve which rewards learning and mastering said systems. Let's just say that this game lacks this kind of stuff so much that the content BRogue has to offer is colossal in comparison, and BRogue is free.\n\nThe only thing in this game that's worth 10€ is the pixel graphics, and even then I'm probably only saying so because I - silly me - got the game first and had a look at the content afterwards.","November 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TopBunL4D/recommended/238280/","TopBunL4D","Fēlz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TopBunL4D/","104 products in account","TL;DR version: Game is a solid C/C+. Worth getting for 5/10$ or if you like rogue-likes/dungeon crawlers and want something new. Personally I had some fun but am going to wait till it's a bit more polished, and some bugs are fixed to play it again.\nGame is still in Alpha/Beta as of this review.\nAlso have not tried coop mode. May or may not make the game more fun.\n\nPros:\n-Game modes. You can choose between having a new dungeon every death, or a static dungeon that changes every day, or even go off a seed. I think this is a good balance that can accomidate most styles of play.\n\n-Classes. Though you have to rescue them from the dungeon first, I liked the veriety available. There seemed to be a good balance between melee/ranged combat; offense/defense; as well as some that fit in the middle.\n\n-Items. I liked that nearly any item could spawn at any point of the dungeon. You might get a sword on level 1/2 of the dungeon that you'd use all the way down. However, that being said; compared to the stats you naturally picked up on your character; strength/defensive stats on items are extremely underwhelming. I frequently had runs where my character would get up to 500-700 strength. Weapons could give a lot, but helms (the only other equippable item) - I think the most I ever saw on one was 5-10? Basically useless.\n\n-Difficulty. With a few exceptions on seeded dungeons that put difficult monsters very early on; as well as the last few hours of my gameplay, I found the difficulty of the game to be challenging but not frustrating. Character Health/Healing items, which are rare/small in a lot of rogue-likes, were abundant but fair, given the damage of some enemies and the difficulty of later levels of the dungeon.\n\nMeh:\n-Art. Pixel art was OK. Not terrible but nothing to write home about. The dynamic lighting was nice sometimes; other times it was annoying.\n\n-Dungeon Veriety. The randomness/pathing of the dungeon didn't bother me; but the tilesets did. You'll recognize patterns almost instantly. There's some variation when you get further down in the dungeon, but it's only a change of skin/color of the bricks - nothing else. Not a big enough deal to make me put it in 'cons', but keep this in mind if you're going to buy it - things are going to get repedative, and fast.\n\nCons:\nNOTE: As this game is still in alpha/beta, take these with a grain of salt.\n-2d/3d enviornment. This was one of the most annoying aspects of the game. You have a fixed view, and your character/monsters in the game are 2d; but the enviornment is 3d. This makes moving and combat awkward because you have to be on the same 2d 'plane' to hit anything. To be fair the game is somewhat forgiving, both making monsters automatically orient to your plane to attack you; and giving your attacks some 3d depth to them - but FAR too many times i had a good run come to a halt not because I didn't react to an enemy; but because they could hit me from an angle from which I couldn't; or be flailing around all over, hitting me every second, and me, not able to move up/down to the right orientation to attack back. On that same note; the hitboxes on some enemies and attacks are very misleading and will leave you frustrated. Given the damage that some enemies do in later parts of the game, this gets to be more and more of a glaring flaw.\n\n-Combat. A little too simple for my tastes; as your attack is simply that. Press a button, or hold it down to do a little more damage. No parries, blocks, dodges (aside from avoiding things manually), etc. No combo's/special attacks. Normally, I'd put this in the 'Meh' category,  except for the reason I finally gave up on this game . Sometimes, for no observable reason, your attacks will be reflected back on you by 'some means'. I say that in quotes because I was left literally baffled at what would happen. There was no warning, no sign of an enemy using a special attack, nothing to learn from or adapt to your next run - id just press attack, as I would have done thousands of times previously, and just die. This happens especially frequently with ranged weapons. Because of the games nature to favor strength/offensive damage; what this means is that EVEN AT FULL HEALTH, WITH PLENTY OF HEALING ITEMS, YOU CAN KILL YOURSELF IN ONE HIT. When (good) runs take over 1, even 2 hours, to die in this way out of the blue was more than frustrating, and a dealbreaker for me.\n\n-'Magic system'. Compared to melee/ranged (guns) attacks, magic is laughably underwhelming. The most powerful offensive damaging magics end up doing as much damage as you'll do with the standard sword within a few levels. Your character levels up strength on thier own; increasing melee/ranged (gun) damage; but there is no corrisponding stat for magic; so the damage/skills remain static. There are a few books to summon creatures, but they generally all too weak to be of any use past the first few levels; not to mention that they get in the way as well. All other magic is generally useless effects. Also, the art/sprites of the magic is all the same - firing a colored skull.\n\n-Inventory system. There is none. You pick up items which appear on a rotating 'belt'. You can cycle back and forth, but you can't orginize them in any way, other than dropping them and hoping to pick them up in the right order you want. You can assign some things to hotkeys...if you can keep it to 2. I understand that this game was made with gamepads/controllers in mind; where buttons are limited...but to not have the option to set more if you are using a keyboard seems dumb.\n\n-Controls. Pretty minor, but if you want to reset a control you have to reset everything. Meaning, the game will cycle through all keys available to that character, and ask for an input for each one. There's no option to choose what single button/command you want to change.\n\nRPG elements/Stat system. Also a minor flaw; mostly because I think this game wasn't meant to be any sort of RPG; but a platformer/dungeon crawler/rogue-like; but it's difficult to see the benifit of stats that your character has. I mean, Health is obvious, and strength is fairly easy to understand in time; but I could never get a handle on defense. Meaning, I had some idea of how much damage monsters did - but having more or less defense; I couldn't tell it making that big of a difference. What this meant is that every character seems to become a glass cannon - only concerned with attack.\n\n\nDespite thier being a lot more Con's than Pro's; I don't hate the game. Up until the last 5-10 or so hours, I was hooked. But I don't see myself playing it again until some of these aspects are fixed.","January 10","false","45.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","4"

Extremely fun and extremely hard at the same time! the beginning feels a little easy with 1 hitting and 2 hitting most things, but once you are a few floors down, the monsters get pretty creative! Don't want to spoil too much, but although you can still 1 and 2 hit many things, you probably wont get the chance to do so!\n\nEach floor feels like a maze where i can make a lucky turn and end up finishing the floor fast, or end up going through the same corridors over and over looking for a new door. Hidden traps and helpful thingies appear everywhere which makes the game feel like a puzzle at some points. Every item you pick up is interesting on their own, and oh so many hats!!!!\n\nThe game only has local co-op which will limit the amount of replayability it has and the inventory system is pretty horrible. You have to cycle through everything you pick up to try and find something useful to use.\n\nOverall the game is fun but has a lot of room to grow.

However the gameplay and design decisions just kill the game.  Rougelikes are random each time through but this game is just too highly dependent on having luck with loot at the begining levels.  With the enemies quickly ramping up and pitch black rooms, if you don't have find better weapons and a hat/weapon based light source you're going to be screwed within the first couple of levels.   The decision to randomize potions on each playthrough while initially interesting gets real old, real quick since the effect is never presented after the first drink thus requiring you to write down what does what on each playthrough.  Finally, and the biggest deal breaker, is the inventory management, which is a nightmare.  With a single line of items which requires the user to scroll through every single item one by one in order to use it, the system punishes the user if they want to switch hats and weapons to change tactics based on what enemy they encounter.  When all of these issues are combined it just takes what could have been great game to something that is just mediocre.","September 22, 2014","false","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's kind of a bland arcade beat-em-up and it doesn't have much depth as a Roguelike. It's easily broken - finding a good spell tome and spamming rooms of enemies with your own friendly monsters is game-breakingly effective. The game is apparently too good to keep track of the potions I've discovered, leading me to accidentally waste healing potions at full health. I've apparently broken the Gambler special room by merely selecting the left and right crates every time. Carrying more than five Inventory items is a pain in the ♥♥♥, even with two quick-select buttons. And the way it does randomized dungeons sucks, as it creates levels with inaccessible secrets and sometimes hides dungeon exits behind secret walls, forcing a trek back through the same three bland rooms before finally figuring out which wall to push against. It's not a bad game - but it needs a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ refinement.\n\nI slagged this game off because it doesn't have a save system, and I'm glad the developers put one in so I can explore and quit at my leisure. But there's still quite a lot of work to do to bring the game up to snuff.","May 10, 2014","false","10.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetigerthatisred/recommended/238280/","thetigerthatisred","Red Pool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetigerthatisred/","195 products in account","this game has a couple of problems.\n\nFirst, leveling. when you level up, you gain an additional 10 health. What's wrong with that? Your current state of health stays the same. So if I level up from 1 to 2, I gain +10 to my maximum health (100 to 110) but my health stays the same (1/100 to 1/110). I wish it would gain me health, as I die very often from the monsters in this game. Oh, and you have to collect green balls to level up.\n\nThe monsters. Most of them aren't problems, but some of them are. My most recent dungeon (as of 3/22/16, 8:02 PM) I activated a switch that game me a monster that did 25% of my health on the second floor. Mind you was only level 2 (24/110 health at the time). So this was a instant kill for me, and something that made me want to stop playing. The monsters also have a pretty good chunk of health, and it doesn't show how much damage they do. Showing how much damage they do is just a personal prefrence, as I would like to know who I could and couldn't take on\n\nThe controls. I play on an xbox 360 controller (it's personal prefrence) and you're able to rebind the controls. Nice! But the way the rebinding is made is a bit inconveient. It goes in an order saying "press a key to make it do "certain action"". It's a nice idea, but the action/use button is your main use of a button, and I wish in the main menu the A key or right trigger would be it untill the game starts. It's a lot easier to remember, and having to come back to this game after a long time would be confusing to have the X be the "accept" button.\n\nOne more thing: this game is unforgiving. Unless you have friends (or amazing RNG), then there's no point to playing. I've got to level 6 because of good RNG, but died because of 2 bosses (it was my fault :P) in the same room that we're too challenging for me. From what I can tell, Unlike Borderlands 2, the monsters stay the same health even if there are more players. It feels like the devs are saying that you need to buy some more copies/have friends to get this game to make the game eaiser. This feels like a cheap trick, as I probably would rather have something saying "pay another $0.99 to continue!" (i'm kidding.). The worst part is it sounds like the devs would do that. I read a review about this game about a player who had a problem, so he refunded. The devs then asked for him to buy it just to try and fix it. Like really? (if you don't believe me: http://imgur.com/kPA0vdJ )\n\nThe gameplay. You see what you get, spam a key/button to kill a monster to get experience to level up to win the game. It's very repetitive, but the monster variations make it a little more fun. There's nothing really much else to say about it.\n\nIs it fun? Yes. Is it a good game? Yes. So why am I giving this a thumbs up? Because I know that this game can improve, and something about this game makes me come back every time. I really do like playing this game, but it does need a couple of fixes.\n\nEdit: I also tried getting the PETA achievement. It didn't work. That means I killed a cat for no reason. I feel bad now.","March 22","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

How so you ask?  The graphics and music are surprisingly good.  The pics on the store page accurately depict the visuals for this game, with moving shadows, and a 3D environment.  The game developers also give players the complete freedom to set their controls on the keyboard, which is definitely a plus.\n\nHowever, these features cannot hide the elephant in the room---the game is BORING.  Battle consists of moving around with your arrow keys to avoid monsters, while spamming the attack button incessantly.  That's it!  You can't cast spells, sneak past the monsters, or do anything else in this game. The goal of the game is to reach the bottom of the 26 floors dungeon, while managing to stay alive.  I guess you could try to aim for the top of the leader board.  But that isn't why I play the game.  I played for 10 minutes, and reached the third level of the dungeon.  However, Legend of Dungeon just doesn't offer enough for me to continue playing this game, over another in my stockpile of unplayed pc and portable console games.\n\nI picked up this game as part of the Humble Weekly Bundle, so I'm not out a lot of money for this game.

Luck will have a huge effect on your success, but there's nothing more rewarding than getting really far in the dungeon with crappy loot, it means you are actually doing very good.\n\nHighly recommended if that is your type of game, you can't go wrong.

I really don't see myself inviting my friends over to play this game on my computer, local co-op games... you just got to love them!\n\nOn the presentation side the game is perfect and looks well polished with the lightning and shadow, it's exactly what you'd expect from a game like this. If you've played Teleglitch the graphical feeling is nearly the same.\n\nOn the gameplay side... it's... atrocious is the word I will use. You can move up, down, left, right, attack to your right or to your left, drink potions, equip new weapons and hats that gives various bonuses and fight a bunch of monsters that feels slightly different one from the other while exploring a dungeon that's made of room that feels the same no matter how different they really are. And that's it. Nothing more to this game then what I just wrote. Lackluster spectacular.\n\nThere's also a shop that I have not discovered yet where you can use your coins... but the interaction with the non player characters is kind of absent... the storyline is absent... the character development is absent... all you do is hack and slash your way to the end boss of this dungeon... why call this game a role playing game?\n\nRight now I can't recommend or give a score to this game since the developers need to finish their product first.

My parameters are:\n\n-I'm busy. I don't have a lot of time to sink into games. I just want something that's really fun every now and then, for a few minutes or maybe an hour or two once a week. Because of that, games that are really hard, games that require grind, games that are slow to get into, and games that get confusing if you put it down for a while and then come back, are not good. If it's a story, it's better actually if it's not to long. I'll never finish a 50 hour game, and that will just irritate me, because I hate not finishing a story. Also:\n\n-I like good art, good story, good sound, interesting worlds.\n-I like good puzzles, well done action. Humor.\n-I like feeling my time playing has been of some real value. I've learned something, been uplifted by great artistry, been inspired, been amused, been challenged, grown. I'm never bored. I don't need a 'Time Sink' I hate 'time sinks.'\n\nGames I've loved include Cave Story, Portal, Flow.\n\nSo, with that background, on to the review. I'll give it to you simple: I only played 30 minutes, because that's all the time the game held me for. And the last ten or fifteen was me being graceful. Sad truth: I've got a lot of games I haven't played. I don't have time to give each game two hours. If it loses me, that's it. deleated. That's what happened.\n\nPros: I loved the art and the sound. There was some good sense of humor. The most fun I had was when my computer was acting up and as I flailed to get focus back on the screen I accidentally drank some beer and was attacked by a bat. That was entertaining.\n\nCons: either not much happens, or it takes more doing to get to things happening. I killed a bunch of bats and snakes with an irritating sword. Flipped some switches, most of which did nothing, and thoroughly explored the first level. Couldn't find my way to the second level. Either there was some puzzle I would have to figure out, or a door I missed. In any case, the game didn't grab me enough to want to try.\n\nWanted More: there was one potion that made me throw up rainbows. that was great. I wanted to have some kind of ranged spell weapon that looked cool. but I didn't find one and I had no idea when I might. The cool or funny things ended up being pretty slow in coming, and the sword was really irritating. combat wasn't fun with it.\n\nI'm sorry developer, my heart goes out to you for making a pretty game, but after fiddling around for a half hour I have no desire to play any more. I guess it was too slow? Not that I wanted more combat, the combat needs to be made more satisfying, at least in the beginning bits. If you're waiting till later to make it fun, it's not working.\n\nAnyhoo, that about wraps up my thoughts. Maybe this kind of game is your cup of tea and you'll love it. To be fair, most games are not my thing. I'm extremely picky because of my limited time.\n\nEnd verdict: deleted after 30 minutes, never going to look at again. Feel bad for the developers. The video’s look really cool but the actual gameplay is boring, at least in the very early bits, playing by myself.\n\nIf you have lots of time on your hands, read someone else’s review and get off my lawn you darn kids.\n","August 31, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am a huge user interface snob, and as such I found this game nigh unplayable. The only issues I really had concerned the UI, so if you don't think it would bother you too much, you might get a great deal of enjoyment from this game. However, because of the UI issues, I cannot recommend it myself.\n\nI loaded up the game and went to change the resolution. Immediately, the first issue arose. There is no drop down menu to select a resolution; instead, I have to cycle through all of them to my desired choice.  "Oh well", I thought, and returned to the main menu and clicked on start.\n\nThe game told me to hold down to enter the tavern. Lacking a controller, I naturally press and hold the 's' key, for a significant amount of time. Nothing happened. I tried the down arrow. Nothing happened. It would seem that the default keys are, most likely, for controllers, even if you don't have one plugged in (except escape, which luckily took me back to the main menu). I set up the controls, unsure how it would play, and continued. After a couple of minutes of playing, it became apparent that I needed to change some of the buttons. So I went back to options to change, and had to re-enter every key again, just to get to the one I wanted to change. I was a little frustrated, but these issues would no longer affect my gameplay.\n\nA short while later, I realised just how annoying this game was going to be. I had 10 items to cycle through, with the only way to do this being a next and previous item method. 5 button presses to get from my sword to my apples (which are used for health restoration), and I'd only been playing for 5 minutes on level 1. It was only going to get worse as I got more useful items, too. This is the main reason why I do not recommend this game.\n\nI'm sure many people would just tell me to drop the items that I don't need, and keep a small supply. A lot of games have some way of forcing the player to regulate their inventory, normally in the form of limited slots (both inventory and hotbar slots) and/or weight management. This works well, and is used in a great number of titles. It forces the player to make a decision on what items they might need immediately (hotbar), while not allowing an infinite supply of items that can make the game too easy, or make the inventory unnavigable. Awkward or lacking controls are not an effective or enjoyable method of inventory management. It's as simple as that.\n\nIgnoring the UI issues, the graphics and visual effects are fantastic. This is the level of graphics detail that all indie games should aspire to have, it really is. The enemies, characters, attacks, particle effects, levels, and especially the tavern, are unrivalled. I quite possibly haven't seen any other game of comparable style come close to how great Legend of Dungeon looks, it is truly impressive.\n\nThe music and sound effects are also absolutely top notch. Every item you pick up makes a brilliant noise, as do all the enemies. I pay so much attention to my exp bar because the colourful explosion when leveling up is so awesome, I never want to accidentally miss it. Even the sound effects in the menu are really good, too.\n\nGameplay wise, it's not leagues ahead like it's graphics/sound, but it is certainly good (ignoring of course the rather severe inventory issue that I've gone far too in depth about). You hack and slash and jump your way through varying enemies and obstacles. The dungeons seem vast and difficult to navigate, and I've already found myself wondering how to get back to certain areas. The gameplay is nothing special, but it is certainly fun. I imagine that this would be a great multiplayer title, it really would.\n\nUnfortunately, the developers have fallen into what I assume must be the deepest trap indie development has; the pile of corpses inside is now so large that the stench is overwhelming. With their limited budget, they have decided to emulate older games, because it is cheaper. This is great in terms of graphics and sound (both of which are excellent in Legend of Dungeon), and even gameplay, for some titles, but should no longer be acceptable in terms of UI design. It does not take oodles of cash to make your UI usable. The inventory system is an absolute mess, and it's for that reason that I cannot recommend this game.","July 7, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have been playing PC games since they were first invented and I love the old style of art as well. It reminds me of the 1st king's quest and space quest games that you had to roam around until you find your way. Such an amazing game. I like the multiplayer in this game too.

Sound is good and cheery. I do have a few issues with the game itself however. The potions are a mess. They randomize them and you have to go thru the process of elemination and thats just not that much fun for a tough game like this. The game is super tough and most I doubt will ever see the ending of this game. I did watch a win on youtube itself and its nothing great. If you never see the end your not missing much.\n\nThe game play itself can be funny with cat hats and other goodies. No cats were harmed in the making of this game.  Not a bad game but I think the asking price of $10 dollars is a little on the high side. I paid $1 dollar for this and 2 other games. Not much to say because the game is somewhat simplistic overall. Run thru the dungeon killing things and at the end either your killed( more then likely) or you win. This game begs for multiplayer and you think it would be easy peasy to do it but I dont think its in the cards sadly. Co op is possible if you like to watch one screen. I think the meta critic side is a little low I would give it a 7/10\n\nI have found a loophole and did make it to the last floor. I got the  treasure and made it back up. I made a backup of the savefile as my brother pointed out ot me I could. I also found out that I could spawn creatures to fight for me. Fun game but really super hard still.","June 5, 2014","true","26.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But after some time with it,  Legend of Dungeon leaves me feeling like the developers weren’t all that interested in their own game, or they ran out of their Kickstarter funding too fast. It’s decent, for what it is: a randomized dungeon romp for up to four players on the same PC, with nice real-time lighting and interesting weapons/magic. The music is well done, over 200 tracks that dynamically blend together based on what’s going on. The pixel art pops out nicely due to the depth-mapping system they’ve got going, and each type of monster/boss requires slightly different strategies.\n\nBut there’s no saving (coming soon says the developer), and if you’re playing alone it’s a little boring. The weirdness of the weapons/items can lead to screen-filling insanity. If you find a sword that summons skeletons each time you hit something, pretty soon you can barely find yourself in the mess. With four players, each with such weaponry, it can lead to issues. There’s only one goal in Legend of Dungeon: go down, get the treasure, come back. No persistence whatsoever, which isn’t really a negative, but it leaves the game very light on content. It feels unfinished, like a beta. It’s also unclear if the developers are going to continue supporting it.","September 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

I had a lot of fun for a little less then half of my experience while playing it, but this game expects you to cheese the hell out of it if you want to get a high score.  Like using a random summon enemy monster spell, while sitting on a platform summoning skeletons and homing skulls kind of cheese.  You spend time and get to the top of the leader boards sure, but you don't actually do anything.","December 12, 2013","false","5.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nextjen/recommended/238280/","nextjen","Next Jen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nextjen/","26 products in account","Welcome to Legend of Dungeon. This is the 8bit game that is completely random and that was made possible by gamers thanks to Kickstarter.\n\nLegend of Dungeon is a 1 to 4 player local co-op game where you can invite your friends over just like how it used to be during the retro gaming age. With this being said, controllers are supported so everyone can play. I love this idea but in a world of online gaming I would have loved to play this game with friends that do not live nearby. Also each time you play, you have to configure your controller setup. This could be fixed once the game is launched and I hope it will be. It is a slight oversight however. Legend of Dungeon was made to be played with controllers and not the keyboard but you can play with either or.\n\nLike any classic RPG game, you start off in the tavern. From there you make your way down different levels of dungeons. Each time you start a new game the layout of the dungeons are different. The same goes for the weapons and items that you pick up, the music and the monsters that you will face. When they say this game is random, it really is. This keeps this not-so-simple dungeon crawler game fresh. Once I started to play this game solo, I didn’t want to stop. There’s a leaderboard that brings the motivation to get the highest score possible. Not only that, the challenge truly comes from how deep can you get into the dungeon before you die. When playing solo once you get killed, that is it, game over and you start from the first level. When playing with more than one player death doesn’t apply, not really. When a member of your party dies they turn into a ghost. The rest of the party members must kill monsters in order for them to drop orbs that the ghost needs to return to the living. If the entire party turns into ghosts, the quest is over.\n\nYou’ll walk into rooms with traps, pressure plates and various other traps that will try to stop you from reaching the last level. Make sure before you leave the tavern that you take some very important items with you like apples for health and a lantern. Some levels are completely dark and you don’t want to be walking blind right into a lava pit or into the axe of a monster, do you?\n\nIf you like retro RPG gaming, this game is for you. For those who enjoy arcade beat’em-ups like TMNT, you will enjoy this game as well. For ten dollars, Legend of Dungeon is a good buy. Check it out on Steam! It is a game that you need to take some time aside since you cannot save your progress as you try to reach the bottom levels. Legend of Dungeon is a innovated game thanks to having everything randomize to keep you guessing.","September 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The art is wonderful though and I found the music suitable for the game but overral the experience is seriously lacking. The current metascore of ~60 seems fair since I can't say I'll be playing this through solo.

LoD is the real deal. 100% random level maps, random traps, random puzzles random hidden items, random potions, random equipment, random shops with random items. Respawning critters. Only real difference is that LoD is realtime, and not turn based.\n\nYou might want to check out a screenshot or two before picking the game up, if you like pixel art style graphics than your in for a huge treat, I personally think its one of the best looking games I've seen in a long time. The graphics are sharp and well defined and its actually 3D to great effect, light and shadow and particle effects... it really is art.\n\nThe music is equally good while you hack and slash and cast crazy summoning spells to fight the hordes in the dungeon.\n\nUnfortunatly there really is no story at all, other than your imagination, but its hard to fault the game as a storyline would probably just get in the way of your exploring and dying and exploring some more.\n\nIn the end yes, its another in a long line of recent Rogue-like or Rogue-style games. but this one has a stunningly unique art and music and item/monster-comedy (you'll just have to see for yourself) that easily makes it stand out from and above the rest.","December 1, 2013","true","3.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akimbo1986/recommended/238280/","akimbo1986","Audi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akimbo1986/","562 products in account","Legend of Dungeon (LoD) opened inside of the bar/tavern at the mouth of the eponymous dungeon. While attempting to figure out the controls and drinking a beer (in-game), this quickly spiraled into a alcohol-induced bar brawl with my fellow patrons quickly leading to my demise and subsequent respawn.\n\nStory		LoD is in many ways similar to other dungeon crawlers and roguelikes. The player is tasked with reaching the 26th floor of the dungeon, fetch the treasure, and return alive.				Aesthetics		LoD is presented as a sort of 2.5D pixel art style, basically, 2D pixels presented on 3D environments. There are some interesting low-poly elements such as the water and smoke along with some interesting lighting choices that make the environments feel suitably gloomy for a dungeon romp. 				Gameplay		The gameplay can be best compared to that of a beat-em-up game reminiscent of the likes of a Golden Axe title. The 2D/3D thing can make hitting enemies successfully a bit difficult, especially in darker sections of the dungeon. This reminds me of many beat-em-up games I've played in the past, so it certainly isn't anything unique (I'm looking at you Secret of Mana).\n\nYou set off into the randomized depths with a weak starting weapon, a beer, and a few apples (the apples healing you for a minimal amount). Item pickups consist of unidentified potions of various colors, new weapons, and hats that modify your stats or provide you with abilities. Managing all of these items, however, is a chore at best. The inventory system is a chore and that's putting it nicely. You navigate your inventory solely by going left or right in your inventory one item at a time. I found myself going through my bottomless inventory tossing out currently unequipped items in order to make the selection process a bit less cumbersome and hopefully prevent me from having to cycle through tens of items trying to find a potion or apple on the verge of death.				Sound		The soundtrack is suitable for the environment presented in the game. Gloomy minimal tunes blend in and out and seem to flow into one another the deeper you progress in the dungeon.				Closing Thoughts		I understand that this game is also has local co-op for up to four players. I can imagine that this game (like just about any other) is tremendous fun when played in that setting. Unfortunately, due to logistics, I am unable to comment on that aspect.\n\nAll that being said, LoD doesn't do that much that hasn't been done before in the dungeon crawling genre. The addition of a more action-oriented gameplay is nice, but you are limited to just smashing one extremely repetitive attack or charging up said attack. The combat lacks a visceral feel and good enemy feedback that really detracts from the action gameplay. Imagine Streets of Rage where the only attack is a jab that repeats and a successful hit on an enemy just sends them sliding back a few feet rather than making them keel over in pain or go flying through the air.\n\nAfter giving LoD a few goes, I can't say that I plan on coming back to it any time soon, if ever unless I find someone to try local co-op with.

The gameplay is challanging, each playthrough is unique, and getting deep in the dungeon feels like an accompishment. The best fun is when you get an overpowered item and tear through everything. Occulus rift compatability is a neat bonus.\n\nThere are two areas that need improvement. Inventory management and VR stutter.  The inventory is difficult to use and requires tedious scrolling. The oculus rift has a bit of nausiating stutter in this game that isn't in more demanding FPS. The stutter wouldn't be so bad if it was a fixed orientation, but this game has the camera scroll along side the player.\n\nEven with the two minor flaws, this game still shines!","January 22","true","61.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Lack of online play also made me really sad as this looks like the perfect type of game for it (And I expected it wen I was looking at the video, but I cant even do LAN with another computer :( )\n\nA year later and goals promised havnt really updated much. The thing that really killed this for me was Local Co-Op. If it was LAN based I could have accepted it, but instead, its Controllers or multiple people on one keyboard.

I like almost all video games somewhat, even if it is bad, but that doesnt mean I can't recognize that the game is a piece of crap.\nIf you are like me and you like most video games, especially rogue-likes, and this game is on sale, I say try it, there are several people who clearly enjoy the game.\nI truly can only speak for myself, and my "recommendation" is really just wether I think the game is that well crafted.\nHowever I must say to the Devers, I think you have potential, my suggestion is to you is to try to add more elements that make each playthrough feel different, and I highly advise you play The Binding of Isaac, it's a very good example.\n\nEdit ~ Wow, I must be bad at the game, as apparently there are several bosses. But this doesn't necissarily change anything, because either I didn't realize a certain monster was a boss, or the boss is too far into the game.

The Indie team have have made it work.\n\nThe setting of the game doesn't really matter, I guess. You're in an environment and you have to do things to progress. It's a video game! but it is fun and the progress is rewarding.\n\nLegend of Dungeon tries to seperate itself from the pack with interesting features. Asynchronous play takes a while to set up, and it's sometimes annoying that you have to wait for other peple to do things befoe you get to have fun. It's not as immediately rewarding as a fully online system but there's some interesting experiences on offer.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, if you're into the cartoony art style, It's not a game you will be writing home about. Character animation is acceptable, but given the obvious attention to detail in the world it seems a shame that all the good looking (and, it has to be said, larger than their competition)  spritescharacters move about in a relatively sloppy way. Backgrounds however are a delight, with wonderfully moody landscapes that have been positively showered with all the colours of rock. At least you can max out all the FSAA settings and run at maximum resolution without too much worry!!\n\nHighly recommended for Adventure fans and anyone who's after a good time.\n\nOverall Score: 8 / 10\n","December 4, 2013","true","39.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is simple but can be very challenging depending on the random generated dungeon with a big variety of enemies. The variety of weapons from the simple swords to shotguns and laser-shooting cats, potions with different effects, spells that can ramdonly summon the hardest enemies in the game to fight on your side or end your run with an one-hit kill, and also hats, lots of hats, don't change much of the core gameplay but make each playthrough different with interesting consequences.\nOverall, it's a fun game with a lot of heart and a more simple take on the roguelike inspired style of games, if compared to some of the most hardcore turn-based/grid-based RPGs.","December 5, 2013","true","28.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AileTheAlien/recommended/238280/","AileTheAlien","Carly 2000","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AileTheAlien/","250 products in account","Short answer:\nBuy this game if you want a simple game to play with other people in the same room.\n\n\nLong version:\nThe aesthetics are this game's strongest features, and can compare favorably to Fez or Spelunky. The lighting effects alone are almost enough to sell this game, as it features dynamic shadows, light and dark areas, and simply makes the game feel alive. The sound effects seem like something out of a game from the 70s or 80s, with the simplified sounds reinforcing the pixellated aesthetic of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough, that it would be a good game to play with other people in your living room. It is easy to imagine a fun-filled evening, consuming beverages and salted snacks of choice, killing zombies and skeletons for fun and profit.\n\nPlaying alone or for extended periods, however, is where the game is weakest. Since the game is 2.5D, you'll often find yourself falling into lava pits, or failing to connect attacks with monsters. After thirty-odd years of platform games being made, sold, and having time to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses, I can only imagine the reasons that they chose to make this game 2.5D. I cannot think of a game where this set of mechanics works. Even playing with friends locally, the fun of laughing at your pals falling into a lava pit for the Nth time, would probably wear off quickly. They could fix this by having a graphical indication of the depth-level of your character, or making the hit-boxes more forgiving to the player.\n\nOther mechanics are equally poor. Combat is a simplistic button-mashing affair, with no chance of using anything other than your single weapon. There are health recover mechanics, armors, and other items, but since the inventory system is so cripplingly simplistic, the only thing you'll have time to do in combat, is to mash the attack button. Outside of combat, the inventory system will also annoy or aggravate. The game has loot-dropping mechanics similar to any Diablo or Torchlight game, where you will find a reasonably large amount of items over the course of your journey. However, your inventory is managed by scrolling left and right through the list of your items, and either equipping, using, or dropping that item. So, it's a game where the loot-dropping encourages picking up every item on the floor, and the inventory-management system forces you to spend most of your time throwing away useless items, so that you can more easily find your health-restoration items after combat, either apples or potions.\n\nThe potions in this game are where its roguelike influences are felt most strongly. They're un-identified, labelled only with a color. After using one of them, however, they remain labelled with their color, meaning you'll have to stop your fast-paced hack-and-slash game, to jot down notes about which potions to keep and which to throw away. Weirdly enough, armor and weapons will enter your inventory identified, although with slightly vague names, which sometimes leave you guessing to their function. A heavy top hat of power, for example, would decrease your jump height due to its weight, and probably increase your combat effectiveness. Expect frequent visits to the internet, to look up what each enchantment does, before you decide on your hat, and continue in the dungeon.\n\nThe levels themselves, are reasonably varied, with randomized layouts, doorways, and monsters. The level generator, however, needs some re-working. About one time in ten, you'll find yourself literally unable to proceed, because the game spawned a dungeon, with no path to get to the next dungeon level. Other times, there will be secret floor-buttons or wall-switches, with no apparent function in the dungeon. One time, I had an unreachable switch spawn at the top of the level with, presumably, a secret staircase to be activated by that same switch. Finally, the dungeons will randomly be filled with dark rooms, where you'll either have to fight with your lantern, or hope you found a hat which gives off some light. Flaming hats and the electro-sphere are good options. The current mechanics and items of the game, make the darkness feel like a feature which was not fully thought out, with frustration being the most likely option, and no productive things the player can reasonably do, to puzzle or fight past the dark rooms.\n\nOverall, this game feels like an unfinished product, which needs many of its existing mechanics fixed, reworked, or removed. It is an OK game for a short evening with friends on the couch, but not something you'd be playing after an hour or two.","December 8, 2013","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You never truly feel overpowered, as one hit can be detrimental to your travels, ending your life quickly. The enemies respawn by entering the rooms accessed through the doors, and can always come at you at your weakest time. Almost everything is out to get you when in the dungeon, but not everything. The things that don't go for you typically are companions to you, but not always. Never judge a creature by its cover.\n\nThe music of this game is great for the atmosphere of the dungeon, and in key moments it may be louder than normal, which is a nice touch. It informs you of what lies in the room to a degree, and feels fitting.\n\nThe new update "Legend Heroes" adds in classes that are quite a challenge to obtain, but are rewarding as you do not always have to start out as the average hero with a sword and lantern battling your way through the dungeon. A nice mix of heroes using skills and weapons that can make or break a trek through the randomly created dungeon is quite the nice addon.\n\nOverall, this game is great for those who seek a challenge and like rogue-likes that provide random things to use on the journey. Fancy wearing a cat on your head while fighting groups of monsters? Well, this game provides such a feature.","April 3, 2015","true","62.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The aesthetic appeal is pretty high but as you might have read already, this is the only aspect where this game excells at.\n\nGameplay is pretty boring after several tries, there isn't any variety to it at all. RPG elements are basic and you can't customize your character, it's all done automatically. Weapons and armor all feel more or less the same because there are basically only two attack types without any depth whatsoever. You can hit enemies and charge up an attack and that is all you have.

The art, lighting and music are all very well done, but the gameplay is boring and repeditive.\n\nThe dynamically generated rooms are frequently generated in ways that don't make much sense, for example a flame trap stuck against a dead end. You can tell that the rooms are just stiched together from pre-specified sections, and there's not a whole lot of sections to choose from.\n\nCombat is kinda boring; just go up to a dude and swing your axe at them. Inventory management is a pain and confusing; the inventory only displays 3 items at a time, and stats for items are displayed without any labels, making comparison a huge pain.\n\nI think the worst blow however is lack of online multiplayer. It shouldn't be too hard to implement as the game is relatively simple, and it would add a lot of emergent gameplay between players. Unfortunately, the game is local multiplayer only, which, in my case, is basically equivalent to single player, and from the web site there doesn't seem to be any plans of implementing it.\n\nIt's nice to watch for the relaxing music and visuals, but I wouldn't call it a game.","July 28, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to be very persistent and have a lot of time at hand to finally reach your goal in single player. Although I finished it x times, in the end I really hated this game for it's unbalanced & unfair onslaught...\n(PS.

If you're lucky, you may even find some good items early on and feel like nothing could possibly kill you. Then something does, all at once and without warning. Maybe you found yourself trapped in a dead end with a wraith hot on your ♥♥♥ and only 50 HP left, or maybe you got overconfident and fell into lava while trying to jump to a potion which was likely a debuff anyway. Maybe you just forgot (or were unable) to heal after fighting that minotaur and got bitten by a snake in an otherwise empty room. Point is, you'll die when you least expect it.\n\nIf you enjoy deadly randomized dungeons and beat-'em-ups with light RPG elements, and you can resist the urge to murder defenseless kittens in a video game then this is the game for you.\n\nSeriously, though, don't don't kill the kittens you psycho. Bad things will happen.","December 23, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is perhaps one of the most fun party games in my roster, and playing it in 4-player mode is utter anarchy, in the best way.\n\nTo tell you the truth, I think LoD spoiled early access games for me. Considering that this game has been in a complete state from practically the start, I expect the same when backing other games, and am often disappointed.\n\nI hope Robot Loves Kitty's next venture - which has gathered quite a bit of critical attention - never overshadows this game, which I think is at the center of their heart. It's obvious, given the fact that they've continued to support it, build upon it, and give even the grumpiest gamers countless excuses to return to its world.\n\nI have yet to beat this game, and I don't care one bit.\n\nFun fact: the husband-half of RobotLovesKitty mentioned to me at PAX that he's only beaten the game once, ever, himself!\n\nAlso: the Oculus mode is something I never would've thought to do with this game, and it somehow makes it even better.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle would be online multiplayer, which I hear is in the works.\n\nLegend of Dungeon is a MUST BUY!","April 4, 2015","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I make this reference even though I know it will plainly sail straight over the heads of most of you youngsters, making me feel like the aging and increasingly irrelevant gaming hipster that I am.  *sigh*\n\nUh, anyway.  The premise of this game is very Rogue.  IE - Journey to the bottom of the randomly generated dungeon to collect the frazzledazzled THING and return for ultimate glory.  Unlike Rogue, it is very light on the RPG mechanics.  You collect glowing experience orbs from fallen enemies and gain levels which translates into direct health and damage increases.  There is no stat or skill management whatsoever.\n\nThe graphics are extremely charming and look like a sweet cocktail of Paper Mario, Realm of the Mad God, and Superbrothers Swords & Sorcery.  The lighting effects in particular are great to behold, lending a bit of rave neon to the otherwise repetitive and uninteresting brick environments.\n\nCombat is both terribly simplistic and very tactical.  You only have two mapped buttons to switch gear between and simple one-button attacks.  However combat is very deliberately paced and timing and planning are more important than button mashing.  For the most part the melee itself is mostly uninteresting as you swat at enemies with your pixelated implements of pain.  However, as you progress there are a number of weapons and items that have interesting properties that make them far more interesting to use.  Want to summon a room full of glowing pink succubi to whip your foes into submission?  There's a spellbook for that.\n\nItems and gear are likewise extremely simple.  There is no armor other than a hat/mask.  Most of these items are barely more than humorous cosmetics but some have alternative properties other than adding to your defense.  Some might light up a room and free your hand from carrying a lantern, while others may make you jump higher.  Like Rogue, there are the random assortment of potions for each run.  There is no way to identify them other than by drinking one, so take note of their effects. Hint: Vomit = Bad.\n\nThere are a number of interesting boss battles to contend with, which can be entirely punishing and impossible if you weren't lucky enough to be graced with the right items during your trip down.  Other times you might cut right through them as if they were rice paper because you chanced upon some of the game's more overpowered items.  Difficulty is definitely a bit uneven, which tends to be true of any Roguelike game.\n\nDrink the Sickly Green Potion if you...\nDesire a Roguelite that is a bit off the beaten path.  This game defintely has a unique vibe to it that melds the gameplay and graphics of the 1980s with modern day sensibilities.\nEnjoy a silly game.  There are deadly Unicorns that fart rainbows to found as well as visors that let you shoot eye beams.\nLove olde tyme sound effects.  They're straight out of an Atari game.\nThrow the Kitten into the lava if you...\nReally aren't sold on "oldskool" appeal.  A lot of what is to be enjoyed here relies on that, and you probably won't get this game if that's not your bag.\nDemand traditional RPG stat crunching.  This game only has the window-dressing of stats and you have little influence over them other than your limited choice of equipment.\nAre easily bored by repetition.  A lot of dungeon runs quickly feel very "samey" due to the scenery bearing little of visual distinction or interest.  There are a few unlocks to find but once you've done a couple runs to the bottom you will have more or less seen most of what the game has to offer.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLegend of Dungeon quickly grew on me with its eclectic mix of visual and gameplay elements.  From womping foes with a giant, glowing hammer to wearing a Shatner mask, to summoning a room full of skeletons.  I'm a huge fan of Adventure Time which brings together so many disparate elements like this and perhaps this is why Legend of Dungeon initially appealed to me.\n\nHowever, after 20 hours or so I soon began to find the experience a bit bleak.  When you trundle through the same environments over and over and see the same enemies throughout it quickly starts to feel like a chore to get to the bottom.  I am not against simple mechanics but feel that this game is too simple.  Part of the fun of a Roguelike is the replayability you get from trying out new classes, spawning with different gear, and discovering new items and enemies fairly regularly.\n\nDepsite its shortcomings, Legend of Dungeon has become one of those games I come back to every once in a while.  It's a solid Roguelite experience and I'd love to see this title become the first in a series.  Take the core elements, expand upon them with more interesting character generation and more/more varied environments, enemies, and items and you could easily have a true legend on your hands.","April 4, 2015","true","33.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a dungeon crawler game with good progression and the random rooms its generates are alright. I haven't gotten too far but a lot of the items (hats and stuff) seem pretty similar stats wise, its one of those flaws that could've been fixed with preset stats rather than everything being random. Also i wish the game took itself a little more seriously. I know its a thing for indie developers to make their retro style games with quirky pop culture refferences, but at this point it would be more innovative to NOT ♥♥♥♥ING DO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING. That aside, Its a good game. Its one of those you die and start over games, and you really start to feel the weight of death very quickly, It's fun to see how far you can get but it would be better if every hat i picked up actually did something different than the one im wearing.\nOr if they weren't stupid as ♥♥♥♥, how hard is it to make normal looking helmets?","March 27, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it’s pretty obvious why I got attracted to it: it has an oldschool look and feel and definitely plays very oldschool. However, it’s permadeath, just like Hack Slash Loot, another roguelike that I’m not very fond of. Maybe it’ll just be a matter of playing this one a little more to warm up to it, I don’t know.\n\nIt kinda reminds me of the old Temple of Doom game for the NES, but it’s a roguelike. The way it works is it’s an action/RPG, but very easy to die, kinda like Dark Souls. That sounds like it should be right up my alley, right? And then suddenly, permadeath. It’d be one thing if it robbed you of a level and put you back a stage or something, but no, game over.\n\nI’ve never been a big fan of permadeath especially considering the way you often learn from games is by making mistakes. Sure, permadeath makes it harder and forces you to be more careful, but it also makes the game more frustrating to the point that it will only appeal to a select few people…and I’m not one of them. Still, it has an interesting visual look and is fairly fun until you die, so if you like the price, go for it.

The gameplay mechanics consist of the typical Hack 'n Slash stuff like 'beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of anything in sight and take all the loot!". You are given an inventory for your loot with two dedicated item hotkeys for picking two items you feel are essential for quick swapping.\n\nThe retro aesthetics combined with contemporary graphical technologies such as bloom and real-time lighting play well with the overall mechanics and actually serve as gameplay elements. Playing solo? just ran into a pitch black room? TOO BAD, you will have to switch to your -1HP hit lantern in order to see where you are going with a high chance of mobs wrecking your ♥♥♥♥. Just like any hack 'n slash game, the optimal amount of players to get far is the most the game supports; 4 players in this case and the game also lets the players use custom names that are used for the leaderboard.\n\nEvery playthrough is never the same. The dungeons are randomly generated and the loot is spread around. Mobs are leveled so you don't get tough mobs until you reach the deeper parts of the dungeons, this actually punishes players who like to bum-rush since they will be missing out on buffed items and stronger weapons that could have assisted them against the stronger mobs.\n\nOverall, Legend of Dungeon is a really fun game and I believe that it is worthy of it's own Arcade cabinet. This game is definitely worth getting if you have people to play with.\n\nIf you are the type that prefers gameplay over GPU straining graphics, then I strongly suggest you try this game.","December 22, 2013","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels like a different way to do Dungeons of Dredmore - another terrific game.\n\n\n\nYou start at what I would assume is ground level, and work your way "down".  Opening secret areas trying to obtain "gold" or pixels.  You consume bottles of colored liquid that may give you a perk or make you throw up fireworks.  There are a few item pickups here and there and the world is somewhat "random" but after playing for a few hours you will figure out it isn't all that random.  A lot of areas are recreated and the secrets are easy to figure out.  Hats are in the game, but act as armour.  Only a few though.....\n\n\n\nI know this game was kickstarted, but it is missing A LOT of what was promised.  It is "Greenlit" but it does not say that it is early access....so the missing content is pretty frustrating.\n\n\n\nThere isn't much to the game - so hopefully updates will come fast and furious, but it doesn't look like that is the case.  Classes are limited to none, there are maybe 10 weapons, and 10 hats.  Not a big deal, but the game is full price and not early access.

LoD is a Rogue game, so you only get one life and no saves. The object is to attempt to get to the bottom of a 26-level dungeon. The game has randomly generated dungeons which appear 8-bit in nature. The lighting effects are next level though, so the game plays quite beautifully with a distinct nod to games of old. I really dug the style. Your character may wield a weapon, use items/potions, and wear different hats. Hats include things like a traditional plate and mail to pirate hats, turbans, light bulbs, and even cats.. yes, cats.\n\nThe developers really like cats, btw. Don't throw them in the lava.\n\nThe monsters in the game are humorous in their non-detailed 8-bit ways and range from bats and snakes, to skeletons, medusas, mummies, and leprechauns. There are many ways to die also. Many. It's quite fun to just see all the different ways. And the game encourages trying things out with no real direction. Pick up a potion? Might as well drink it. Oh, it turned me into goo. Nice. Have to remember that one on the next playthrough.\n\nPick up LoD. It's fun. And cheap.","January 1, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art, lighting and music are all very well done, but the gameplay is boring and repeditive.\n\nThe dynamically generated rooms are frequently generated in ways that don't make much sense, for example a flame trap stuck against a dead end. You can tell that the rooms are just stiched together from pre-specified sections, and there's not a whole lot of sections to choose from.\n\nCombat is kinda boring; just go up to a dude and swing your axe at them. Inventory management is a pain and confusing; the inventory only displays 3 items at a time, and stats for items are displayed without any labels, making comparison a huge pain.\n\nI think the worst blow however is lack of online multiplayer. It shouldn't be too hard to implement as the game is relatively simple, and it would add a lot of emergent gameplay between players. Unfortunately, the game is local multiplayer only, which, in my case, is basically equivalent to single player, and from the web site there doesn't seem to be any plans of implementing it.\n\nIt's nice to watch for the relaxing music and visuals, but I wouldn't call it a game.","July 28, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/recommended/238280/","unpieced","Qt Alix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unpieced/","356 products in account","I recently played Delver, right before I tried out this game. I must say, I am shocked at the similarities. There are 26 floors which you descend down to get treasure (compared to Delver's 7), and then you make your way back up to the Tavern where you started. "It's a simple hack and slash where you don't have anything like classes or ability branches, but is reduced to the basic concept of wander a dungeon and collect loot." as stated by someone on Metacritic, as also with Delver, and there's even a lich king enemy. However, unlike Delver which has a few flaws that can be looked over, I recommend this game far less. I realize Legend of Dungeon is still in beta and has time to fix the things that are wrong, but this game is extremely unbalanced  in many ways and will need a lot of work to fix it's many mistakes. So where to start? I have a lot to say, so I'll start with the more minor flaws/glitches and work up to the big things. Scroll past the list to see the main problem which lies in the game's mechanics.\n\n•  The writing is so tiny that I can barely make out the description or title of any items, even when the screen was made bigger.\n•  The inventory is messy, cluttered, and very inconvient. Instead of seeing your entire inventory at once, you scroll left and ride to see one item at a time. Similar items, except for apples, don't stack either. This makes it difficult to quickly switch items and if you have a lot of them, it takes a while.\n•  People have remarked at how beautiful the dynamic lighting is, and I'll even go farther to say that this game has beautiful particle effects, but the lighting from a lantern is so bright it's hard to see enemies because it just sort of blinds them out.\n•  There are lots of secret doors with seemingly no way to open them after much searching, and there are often high nooks and crannies with items on top that seem impossible to reach. Yes, there are floor pressure plates, secret wall pannels, levers, and fire activated switches, but I've come across a lot of rooms that I've searched top to bottom and found nothing.\n•  You will die if you fall into lava, but the bridges to cross can be so small (the size of your feet small) that it's unfairly effortless to fall into it.\n•  The potions are randomized with each play through but after you drink them, they aren't labled for the next time. There's too many to remember them all, so you'll just have to write down the effects for ones you can't keep track of.\n•  Experiance disappears way too quickly. If there are a big group of enemies, of even a small group of strong enemies, the majority of experiance will disappear while I am still fighting. And stopping the fight to gather experiance will knock a ton of health off of you since enemies will be following behind you, attacking. I have unfairly lost a LOT of experiance from this.\n•  Even after you've cleared a room, enemies will periodically come through the door. New enemies entered a room so often that it was hard just to get a few seconds of peace to drink potions, heal, or modify my inventory.\n•  Door ways are often blocked by enemies, even powerful enemies. Just trying to push past them to enter the room can grant you a large deal of damage.\n•  There's no map which is a huge necessity. Despite it being 2D, it's still very easy to get lost. There are many doors, often 3-5 doors within one room, and since most of the rooms look a like, it's easy to lose your bearings and second guess if you were already in a particular room. This also means that when you reach the 26th floor and retrieve the treasure, going back up will be a guessing game, running from door to door to find each set of stairs. Yes, this game does have cans of spray paint to mark door ways. As I traveled down, I was marking each door that lead upstairs to allievate the headache for my ascent. However, after you save and quit and reload later on, all the spray paint on the walls has completely vanished. This game can't possibly be beat in one playthrough either (solo). It will take hours upon hours to beat.\n\nNow onto the real problem with this game. I mentioned Legend of Dungeon being completely un-balanced, and I seen this in every major area, which I'll do my best to explain. For starters, the majority of monsters only drop 2 exp, which is frusterating when you need 100-500 experiance to reach the next level. It literately isn't until you are half done with the game that you run into monsters who drop a decent amount of experiance. This makes leveling up a hard process, which is what you depend on more than anything to survive. To top that off, the main source of health is apples. There are healing potions too, but they are very rare. Apples restore a 5 points of health. That's it, five points. You start with 100 HP points and but as you level up, that grows. Right before I died, I was shy of 400. Leveling up does NOT restore HP either. Even early on, some hits from enemies do 5 damage. Later on, a single hit can do as much as 40 and beyond. And apples are NOT common, at all. I've gathered a couple dozen in the beginning levels, which is where they are most frequent, but the deeper you go, the less common they are. I would go many floors without seeing a single apple. So running out of apples happens pretty quickly. In fact, I always died because I ran out of them and couldn't heal. So during one playthrough, I was absolutely determined to win.  If I didn't win this round, I was going to give up. I put my all into it. And this where the seriously messed up the game's mechanics really show. I found a gambler earliar on in the game, to whom you bet money against. You can get many things but the you most frequently get coins, apples, or an enemy. I legit spent over 2 hours hoarding over 500 apples. It was a huge pain in the ♥♥♥, but I thought "There's no way I can lose now. I surely have enough health to make it down to the 26th floor." Here's proof if you don't believe me, which I don't blame you. http://oi62.tinypic.com/2zxtkdd.jpg\nShortly after that, I  came across an axe that did 200 damage that killed many enemy types in one hit and also aquired two unlimited monster tombs to spawn monsters to fight for me. With all that, I *still* died. I had ran all out of apples and had half my health. As soon as I entered level 22, there was  a Robot boss that killed me. It's not supposed to be activated until approached, but it was already awake, and it contiously spawned so many enemies that I couldn't kill them fast enough to even focus on the Robot itself. They didn't even seem to die either. It was a train wreck mess with almost the entire screen cluttered with enemies. So even with 500 apples, a 200 hit point weapon, and 2 monster summoning spell books, I still could not win. Even with my great amount of experiance, I still was very weak to a lot of enemies and had used my monsters to fight a ton of battles for me, which felt like cheating. I put so much time and effort into that one playthrough that I am convinced this game is not winnable unless in multiplayer. You shouldn't have to rig the system like I did, ridiculously hoarding apples, to win, and in the end that didn't even work, which to me screams that this game is un-acceptably difficult and unbalanced in the most important systems- health and experiance. And to put the icing on the cake, it just wasn't entertaing enough. As HookedGames from Metacritic put it, "There is plenty of variety in the equipment that you find and the enemies you will face, but it is never enough to engage you for any great length of time." I was determined to beat this game, but awfully bored while trying to do it. I desperately want to like this game, but I can't. At the moment there's just too much wrong with it.","July 13, 2014","false","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rachelkitten/recommended/238280/","rachelkitten","Rachel 🐾🐾","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rachelkitten/","800 products in account","First off what can be said about this game. Even though I have had it for a while, I haven't played it that much. When I first became aware of this game I thought that the graphics were very cute. Also the lighting looked gorgeous. At the time Northernlion said that the game was in Alpha and playable, unfortunately after that there was a Kickstarter Campaign and then the Alpha was removed. I figured out why when the game was released.\n\nFirst off it handles poorly. I don't know if this is intentional or not, but there is also extremely poor hit detection. I must say the game looked more fun when someone else played it. I wanted to really like this game. I even did something rare and bought it when it was released! It doesn't seem like anything has changed since the alpha, so why did it take them so long to release it? It feels like an unfinished tech demo. I wish I had more positive things to say about this.\n\nIt is a Roguelike-like, but not really. The dynamic music system I found to be annoying at best, maybe it was just what was generated in my playthrough. Also the levels all appeared to be the same and actually poorly layed out. It seems that they used set pieces instead of a truely procedurally generated dungeon. Also while the lighting is really nice, it is too gray and dull.\n\nItem management is a nightmare. I don't see how this wasn't changed somehow or complained about. I don't see how a better sorting system couldn't have been created. Oh, thats the challenge of the game you might say. Roguelikes are meant to be difficult. I enjoy them. For some reason, I was expecting something better than the initial alpha that I saw.\n\nAlso a cardinal sin in 2014. No Online Multiplayer. What?! Only Local Co-op. I don't know ANYONE who invites 3 other people to cram themselves in front of a screen to play. What could have been an excellent LAN Party game just doesn't get any play at all. Why bother playing at all? There is no story, there is no depth. There is no point to this game. You're doing this just for the sake of doing it. While most roguelike stories are a bit ramshackle at best, at least there is some kind of Lore or atmosphere. I expected more depth from the combat. Combat has a disconnected unfinished feeling. There is no sense of progression or accomplishment beyond "I made it to level X with Y gold".\n\nAlso, no ability to save the game. This is almost unforgiveable. Not even a quick save option. Even most hardcore roguelikes don't force you to quit your game without saving your progress. Have a sweet character and weapon set? Oh thats too bad, you just have to quit the game and try all over again. This is broken and frustrating.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I gave it about an hour of play before it was really boring and frustrating. I didn't pay much for the game, so I don't want my money back, but I wouldn't buy another game from Kitty Loves Robot again. The only positive thing really is hopefully other devs will see what is wrong with this game and not make similar mistakes.","March 13, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AileTheAlien/recommended/238280/","AileTheAlien","Carly 2000","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AileTheAlien/","250 products in account","Short answer:\nBuy this game if you want a simple game to play with other people in the same room.\n\n\nLong version:\nThe aesthetics are this game's strongest features, and can compare favorably to Fez or Spelunky. The lighting effects alone are almost enough to sell this game, as it features dynamic shadows, light and dark areas, and simply makes the game feel alive. The sound effects seem like something out of a game from the 70s or 80s, with the simplified sounds reinforcing the pixellated aesthetic of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough, that it would be a good game to play with other people in your living room. It is easy to imagine a fun-filled evening, consuming beverages and salted snacks of choice, killing zombies and skeletons for fun and profit.\n\nPlaying alone or for extended periods, however, is where the game is weakest. Since the game is 2.5D, you'll often find yourself falling into lava pits, or failing to connect attacks with monsters. After thirty-odd years of platform games being made, sold, and having time to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses, I can only imagine the reasons that they chose to make this game 2.5D. I cannot think of a game where this set of mechanics works. Even playing with friends locally, the fun of laughing at your pals falling into a lava pit for the Nth time, would probably wear off quickly. They could fix this by having a graphical indication of the depth-level of your character, or making the hit-boxes more forgiving to the player.\n\nOther mechanics are equally poor. Combat is a simplistic button-mashing affair, with no chance of using anything other than your single weapon. There are health recover mechanics, armors, and other items, but since the inventory system is so cripplingly simplistic, the only thing you'll have time to do in combat, is to mash the attack button. Outside of combat, the inventory system will also annoy or aggravate. The game has loot-dropping mechanics similar to any Diablo or Torchlight game, where you will find a reasonably large amount of items over the course of your journey. However, your inventory is managed by scrolling left and right through the list of your items, and either equipping, using, or dropping that item. So, it's a game where the loot-dropping encourages picking up every item on the floor, and the inventory-management system forces you to spend most of your time throwing away useless items, so that you can more easily find your health-restoration items after combat, either apples or potions.\n\nThe potions in this game are where its roguelike influences are felt most strongly. They're un-identified, labelled only with a color. After using one of them, however, they remain labelled with their color, meaning you'll have to stop your fast-paced hack-and-slash game, to jot down notes about which potions to keep and which to throw away. Weirdly enough, armor and weapons will enter your inventory identified, although with slightly vague names, which sometimes leave you guessing to their function. A heavy top hat of power, for example, would decrease your jump height due to its weight, and probably increase your combat effectiveness. Expect frequent visits to the internet, to look up what each enchantment does, before you decide on your hat, and continue in the dungeon.\n\nThe levels themselves, are reasonably varied, with randomized layouts, doorways, and monsters. The level generator, however, needs some re-working. About one time in ten, you'll find yourself literally unable to proceed, because the game spawned a dungeon, with no path to get to the next dungeon level. Other times, there will be secret floor-buttons or wall-switches, with no apparent function in the dungeon. One time, I had an unreachable switch spawn at the top of the level with, presumably, a secret staircase to be activated by that same switch. Finally, the dungeons will randomly be filled with dark rooms, where you'll either have to fight with your lantern, or hope you found a hat which gives off some light. Flaming hats and the electro-sphere are good options. The current mechanics and items of the game, make the darkness feel like a feature which was not fully thought out, with frustration being the most likely option, and no productive things the player can reasonably do, to puzzle or fight past the dark rooms.\n\nOverall, this game feels like an unfinished product, which needs many of its existing mechanics fixed, reworked, or removed. It is an OK game for a short evening with friends on the couch, but not something you'd be playing after an hour or two.","December 8, 2013","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You start with your character at the  dungeon entrance and make your way far down into the lower levels... or will you? Only equipped with a sword, some apples a lantern and your courage you dare to enter the dungeon, just for the sake of retrieving the gold that (legend has it) can somewhere be found at the lowest floor. But beware, many have also warned you of the dangers lurking on the lower levels of the burried fortress...\nYou have to make your way through each random generate level filled with various types of monsters. The further you proceed down, the harder the monsters get. You got a basic interface showing your attack power, speed, experience points, defense level and your gold. The overall aim is to collect as much gold as possible on your journey, which will in most cases end up in your death fighting a horde of skeletons or worse. For your assistance you can collect items you can find lying on the dungeon floor (... maybe remains of previous unlucky adventurers...) or retrieve them from killed enemies. But beware... not all items you collect will grant you assistance... if you're unlucky you end up finding a potion draining your strenght or even worse... a cursed book... summoning in the devil himself if you read out the occult lines...\nOf course you can also start your journey with up to four friends... however you have to invite them to your place, as online coop isn't supported. Furthermore the game is more luck, than skillbased, as you rely on the dropped items to be able to continue your journey. Nevertheless the game kept me motivated to sink several hours into it.","January 10, 2014","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That all being said, this game plays a lot better with friends (think Magicka in this regard) and is a good game if you are looking for a dungeon crawl.  The biggest issue I have with it is that it is local co-op as opposed to across online since you then need to plug in controllers for your computer which is not easy for the casual player.  Overall I would give it a 5/10 since the single player scratches the dungeon crawl itch but unless you are playing with friends it is not that much more.","January 11, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SInce the game is quite difficult and relies on some randomness it's highly unlikely anyone will be able to beat this on their first play through.\n- Nice variety of items and monsters\n- Great pacing. New monsters, items and random NPC events are revealed in such a way that keeps the game interesting.\n\n\nTHE BAD\n- Some people would complain that there isn't much difference in the look of the dungeon as your progress other than lighting. All rooms feel fairly simmilar.\n- Currently there is no save feature... Which wouldn't be a problem other than a good run can last upwards of 4 hours. But apparently a save feature is something in the works though.\n- Only local co-op.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n- Worth picking up.

You never truly feel overpowered, as one hit can be detrimental to your travels, ending your life quickly. The enemies respawn by entering the rooms accessed through the doors, and can always come at you at your weakest time. Almost everything is out to get you when in the dungeon, but not everything. The things that don't go for you typically are companions to you, but not always. Never judge a creature by its cover.\n\nThe music of this game is great for the atmosphere of the dungeon, and in key moments it may be louder than normal, which is a nice touch. It informs you of what lies in the room to a degree, and feels fitting.\n\nThe new update "Legend Heroes" adds in classes that are quite a challenge to obtain, but are rewarding as you do not always have to start out as the average hero with a sword and lantern battling your way through the dungeon. A nice mix of heroes using skills and weapons that can make or break a trek through the randomly created dungeon is quite the nice addon.\n\nOverall, this game is great for those who seek a challenge and like rogue-likes that provide random things to use on the journey. Fancy wearing a cat on your head while fighting groups of monsters? Well, this game provides such a feature.","April 3, 2015","true","62.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Interesting and surprising enemies are around every corner and behind every door.  Monsters, items, the dungeon itself, along with the potion color and effects are all random. We played this game so much that a stack of sticky notes with potion names were filling up the empty space on my desk and started collecting on the floor beneath( you never know what a potion does until you try it ! )\n\nThey are always releasing plenty of updates ( which you can actually watch them develop on twitch) - and I believe classes and pets should be coming soon.\n\nIf you have ever played Brogue, Pixel Dungeon, or are a roguelike - hardcore game fanatic like I am, you'll love it.","November 24, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It combines pixel art with advanced lightening in a very effective way. The aesthetic appeal is pretty high but as you might have read already, this is the only aspect where this game excells at.\n\nGameplay is pretty boring after several tries, there isn't any variety to it at all. RPG elements are basic and you can't customize your character, it's all done automatically. Weapons and armor all feel more or less the same because there are basically only two attack types without any depth whatsoever. You can hit enemies and charge up an attack and that is all you have. Furthermore the hit detection can feel quite wonky and sometimes you get without knowing why.\n\nThe nature of the game is random, so you always get a new dungeon with different items. But each playthrough doesn't feel distinctive enough. Basically you have the same boring dungeons and you see the same loot over again. Potions have unique effects but overall there isn't much depth here.\n\nI don't recommend this game, not even as a timewaster. It's shallow and doesn't offer anything good.","November 29, 2014","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks much like the sideways games from ULTIMATE PLAY THE GAME titles like ENTOMBED, STAFF OF KARNATH. The rest plays much like a rogue RPG, get to the bottom of the generic build dungeon, fight monsters, get the treasure and improve your stats & equipment along the way. Alas, some bugs & gameplay issues make the game virtually unplayable in single-player:\n\nPROS:\n- Functional & nice graphics, superb light effects, pleasant music, simple controls and some equipment with interesting properties make up for a fun start.\n- Fun & challenging till level 20\n- One more try feeling\n\nCONS:\n- bugs: return to tavern to find yourself suddenly in multiplayer mode, all potions sometimes get other effects when resuming game, sometimes losing your saved game, paintjob gone when resuming or entering tavern, level 26/27 dropping thru stairs making going up again sometimes impossible, returning treasure sets gold score to 0, inventory selections sometimes blocks visually\n- gameplay issues: frustrating, unbalanced & unpleasant from level 21 on, entering room while monster entering thru same door thus blocking your (escape) exit, rooms sometimes cramped with multiple bosses & high damage monsters on lower levels and in meantime new monsters of same difficulty keep appearing thru doors making the odds even harder if not impossible\n- to much depends on LUCK: finding decent weapons, armor, spells, potions, shops, smiths (but mostly not, giving an unfair feeling against the odds on the lower levels)\n\nSo all in all, you will have a lot of fun in the beginning but because of above issues, you will also know you will certainly die before you even get near the deepest levels. You need to be very persistent and have a lot of time at hand to finally reach your goal in single player. Although I finished it x times, in the end I really hated this game for it's unbalanced & unfair onslaught...\n(PS. I deviced a save/load feature for myself to give me a fair chance on the lower levels as my equipement was most of the time not up to the challenge with the mosters I had to face there ...)","August 9, 2014","false","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The item design and graphics of the game are beautiful, and by far it's most attractive quality.

Knowing when to attack, move out of the way and pulling off a nice combo as a reward is what it’s all about.\n\nInstead we have a mish-mash of half-baked ideas and genres that simply don’t mix (at least the way it’s been implemented): the player melee attack does have a small windup and cool down but most enemies damage you by simply touching you, the strategy is to simply wail on the mob of npcs, hoping your hp outlasts that of the enemies’ and that you’ll find enough apples to heal up for the next encounter. And of course there’s plenty of items, potions and helmets that the game does a pretty poor job at explaining what they do exactly.\n\nI also heavily despised the player’s walking animation, the workaround for such a low-res sprite is having both legs never cross each other when moving, and making a very short but irritating stop after the character takes a step.\n\nAt least the lighting effects are pretty.","April 29, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The problem is that its appearance is the only thing I really liked about it. The controls are kind of clunky, all the loot I found was very similar, and I found it far too difficult. Even being careful, the healing options are so limited that eventually you just get nibbled to death by random things. The game is also very bad at communicating what items do.\n\nMaybe it opens up when you get further down, but there are very few options up-front and the game didn't do anything to make me want to see more.

It's a dungeon crawler game with good progression and the random rooms its generates are alright. I haven't gotten too far but a lot of the items (hats and stuff) seem pretty similar stats wise, its one of those flaws that could've been fixed with preset stats rather than everything being random. Also i wish the game took itself a little more seriously. I know its a thing for indie developers to make their retro style games with quirky pop culture refferences, but at this point it would be more innovative to NOT ♥♥♥♥ING DO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING. That aside, Its a good game. Its one of those you die and start over games, and you really start to feel the weight of death very quickly, It's fun to see how far you can get but it would be better if every hat i picked up actually did something different than the one im wearing.\nOr if they weren't stupid as ♥♥♥♥, how hard is it to make normal looking helmets?","March 27, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sounds simple: get to the bottom of the dungeon, find the treasure, and bring it back... Just don't die. However, this "don't die" part of the game is astoundingly difficult! This is a roguelike game that takes its genre very seriously - you WILL die. A lot.\n\nYet, this difficulty doesn't provide a soul-crushing desire to uninstall the game and then break your computer into a million tiny pieces. Instead, the games charming visuals, soothing music, and enjoyable gameplay just lure you into another round of dungeon-crawling, brawler-style goodness.\n\nLegend of Dungeon is not a game without flaws - the inventory management system definitely needs an overhaul. It can be frustratingly difficult to cycle through all of your items just to re-equip your sword or magic spell tome, or whatever it is you want to use. However, I continue to be drawn back to the enchanting gameplay to face the challenge time and time again in what I consider a fantastically well-done indie title.\n\nP.S. There are hats.

It's one of those games you can throw on some music and mindlessly play, yet the difficulty level to complete it is probably higher then most games.  Every run I make I find different items, and usually die some weird way I didn't even think was possible.  Excellent game, can't wait until they add multiplayer!","December 27, 2013","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArkadeNoah/recommended/238280/","ArkadeNoah","ArkadeNoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArkadeNoah/","55 products in account","Legend of Dungeon is a game with a simple goal that is extremely difficult to achieve. It sounds simple: get to the bottom of the dungeon, find the treasure, and bring it back... Just don't die. However, this "don't die" part of the game is astoundingly difficult! This is a roguelike game that takes its genre very seriously - you WILL die. A lot.\n\nYet, this difficulty doesn't provide a soul-crushing desire to uninstall the game and then break your computer into a million tiny pieces. Instead, the games charming visuals, soothing music, and enjoyable gameplay just lure you into another round of dungeon-crawling, brawler-style goodness.\n\nLegend of Dungeon is not a game without flaws - the inventory management system definitely needs an overhaul. It can be frustratingly difficult to cycle through all of your items just to re-equip your sword or magic spell tome, or whatever it is you want to use. However, I continue to be drawn back to the enchanting gameplay to face the challenge time and time again in what I consider a fantastically well-done indie title.\n\nP.S. There are hats.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shandrake/recommended/238280/","shandrake","Drunk Tomato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shandrake/","748 products in account","Legend of Dungeon is a rogue-like dungeon-crawler where you start with nothing but a sword, some apples, and a lantern, and descend through levels and levels of a procedurally generated dungeon. Along the way you collect hats to wear, new weapons to wield, spellbooks and potions and all sorts of other loot, making each playthrough a unique experience.\n\nThe game is really quick, simple, and addictive. It reminds me a lot of FTL in its pick-up-and-play gameplay. A cool feature is the ability to play local co-op with friends, but the game really does stand up on its own as well. The graphics are unique, but they grew on me. There's something about the lighting mixed with the music mixed with the simple sprites that gives everything a very awesome aesthetic.","September 15, 2013","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the last time I remember really looking forward to a game release - excited in some of the way we all got excited about upcoming games in highschool. This and Hammerwatch - both hyped as Zelda/Y's -like hack n slash RPG adventures with roguelike elements. LoD (and Hammerwatch to be thorough) released and I was so let down. Hammerwatch is great but not quite what it was supposed to be. Legend of Dungeon - this game - was an utter disappointment. It was NOTHING like the development hype and blogs. No real RPG elements, no adventure, no quests really - its a Roguelike and pretty much just that. Room to room combat, pick up a few items, try to unlock hidden content that nobody could care about. Nothing in this game is motivating, nothing makes me want to play further. For all intents and purposes, the developers either scrapped everyting good in this game (aside from the artwork) at the last minute, or they intentionally decieved us to sell units by representing it as an adventure or anything with RPG elements - which do not measurably exist in LoD.\n\nLegend of Dungeon is a dull, skeleton of a game with no content of interest, nothing remotely fun, and seems to be a Michael Bay-esque experiment in "lets see how little effort we can exert and still make lots of money". Either the developers didnt care, had no intention of making the game they promised during development, or are just not very imaginative or creative. The artwork and technology in regards to visuals is/are stunningly beautiful, the lighting alone is amazing. But pretty tech does not a good game make. Is this actually a tech demo they spun as a game to make some bucks? The game just isnt there guys - its more simplistic than 1980's original version of Gauntlet.","June 1","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
