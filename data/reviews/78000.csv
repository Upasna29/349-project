"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/78000/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Bejeweled 3 is probably one of the best Match 3 games available on Steam, or if not, then it's definitely the most complex one. It features various game styles, thus satisfying different gamer personalities.\n\nIf you like to be under pressure, then there's the Lightning Mode, in which you have a timer that you can be increased by quickly match some special time gems. Diamond mine provides a similar tension: there's a timer too, but in this mode you dig in the stone and sand by matching 3 - 5 gems in order to uncover treasures. However the most stressful game mode is probably Ice Storm - in which you have to fight the climbing columns of ice that quickly threaten to cover the entire board; to prevent this you need to have quick reflexes and a very good perception of the available matches. In order to beat this game mode, I had to switch to mouse and keyboard controls (mouseovering the tile selects it and WASD moves it in the corresponding direction).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=446286039\n\nOn the contrary, for those that like a more relaxed approach, there's the Zen mode - the classic Match 3 in which you can enable/disable different relaxing background effects and positive affirmations. Another relaxed mode, but more suitable for those that have an analytical mind or love to strategically solve a puzzle, is the Butterfly mode, in which some of the gems are transformed into butterflies that automatically move one tile up whenever another match is made; having one of them reach the top of the board ends the game. This implies that you have to plan ahead your moves and optimize the matches so that they contain as many butterflies as possible.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=446286100\n\nI found Poker mode to be the least attractive of all these modes - you are required to build certain poker hands by having consecutive matches of the same colors. It's a game of chance, since your poker hands highly depend on the randomness of the current tiles.\n\nLastly, there's the Quest mode that contains 40 variations of all these described above: finding a certain number of treasures or freeing a certain number of butterflies, or ticking bombs that need to be matched before the timer wears off etc.\n\nThe game adapts itself to the game mode you're playing. For example, in Diamond Mine or Ice Storm mode the game will provide you with suitable gems to create matches or 4 or 5 which result in special gems that help clearing up the board faster. In Poker mode you’re more likely to have gems of the same color grouped together, thus facilitating the process of obtaining good poker hands.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a good Match 3 game, if you enjoy the style. But it's quite addictive, so it will probably keep you entertained for hours. Even more so, going for 100% achievements requires a lot of time of grinding.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","May 20, 2015","true","50.3"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","43","52","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelesis666/recommended/78000/","Kelesis666","Paikia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kelesis666/","608 products in account","Being based on the simple 'Match-3' principle, this game might be considered dull or boring by people who don't like the concept, but for people who do (including yours truly), such games can get really addicting. Ever since I got 4 Elements and beat it, I've been looking for a similar game to fall down to, when I'm not in the mood for anything involving a steep learning curve. I've had my eye on Bejeweled 3 for a while, but paying $20 for it just didn't feel justified. So I waited and waited.... until it was finally 50% off during Steam's autumn sale, and then I snatched it. My greed told me to keep waiting, as I would've loved to pay even less, but I decided to shake off the greed, telling myself that for $10 it was a fair deal.\n\nAs soon as I started playing, I realized this game was worth every cent of the $10 I paid, if not more. It manages to take this simplistic and supposedly "dull" concept of Match-3 and make it as much fun as it can get. It has quite a few game modes, including some with really funny twists (such as the 'Poker' or 'Butterflies' mini-games).\n\nI won't keep on rambling, I'll just summerize it - if you like this type of games, Bejeweled 3 is as good as they come. If you're not up to paying $20, wait for it to go on sale or get a coupon or whatever, but either way - make sure you do get it. :)","December 15, 2013","true","48.7"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","2"

I decided to play it to waste some time waiting for another game to download. This wizard-sorcerer-magedom destroyed 5 hours in a row of my life.\n\nSit and listen to my tale, for it may save you from eternal damnation.\n\nThe premise of the quest seemed innocent enough, "Thou shall combine th' jewels of same purpose and they shalt bequeath onto you the path forward." Each combination of the arcane jewels would expel a wondrous light that would melt any icy cavern, cut through the webs of a spider ridden forest, or sweep away entire dunes of the driest desert. However, unbeknownst to I, there was one fatal drawback. The lights, the explosions, the lightning ... I-I couldn't stop. These cubes--they called for me.\n\nThat's when it happened. Two cubes next to each other.\n\nI didn't know what to do. My mind argued with itself thinking, "I can't, I shouldn't, I musn't ... I have to."\n\nMy soul couldn't comprehend what happened next.\n\nA silhouette of a man stepped out. My eyes, vexed by the colors, attempted to inspect him further. He was short, but intimidating. I remained paralyzed--awestruck--mind racing for an explanation. He paused and revealed a large grin on his face. With a single swipe of his tiny hand everything and its existence around us turned into a bright energy. The divine light displaced electricity in an ear deafening crackle of explosions. His mighty voice, as if emanating from the ground itself boomed "spectacular."\n\n~~\n\nI sit here now, a vessel of an unknown man, petrified by the curse known as Bejeweled. Time is non-existent outside the confines of it's own dimension. Be wary, those who journey the path of the Jewel. Heed my tale as warning, traveler. This pied piper may claim you akin.\n\nOh yeah, did I mention the music is FTL-esque and pretty cool?","April 26, 2015","true","12.3"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","77","33","43","26","1"

This is a simple, casual game with a grid that requires you to shift colored jewels and match them into lines of 3 - 5. You can only shift 2 jewels if it will result in a line of 3+ matching colors. Very easy game, but where this game blossoms is all of the mini games / variations of it. Dozens of modes, all centered around making lines. There is classic mode that has you going through levels making lines, lightning rush, which has a very limited time and you need to collect time ups to keep going, diamond mine, where you need to match lines near the bottom rock to destroy the rock and progress further down. Bejeweled poker which every line is like a hand gains you something similar to a card in poker. Butterfly mode has you making lines with jewel butterflies to keep them from reaching the top of the screen where it will be an end of game. There is also a never ending zen mode, which is just like classic only without levels that break the flow of what you have going. Finally, there is an ice breaker mode which forces you to keep up with rising and freezing water. Once a line gets frozen enough its game over.\n\nIn a way, I prefer Candy Crush, because they have focus on levels, rather than letting you free to pick modes to play. I just feel overwhelmed with all of the choices and just end up playing 'classic' mode for the most part. On a plus side, unlike Candy Crush, there are no micro transactions. You've bought the whole game and need to unlock the modes.\n\nBejeweled 3 has a level system that keeps track of all of your points throughout all of your games and a high score amongst your friends. That seems to be my real driving force to play the game, just to beat my friend's high scores and since every time you play, you start with a random grid of jewels, its got something to do with luck as well as skill.\n\nI can recommend the game, but I could recommend it more on the phone. I just feel there are better games I could be playing on my PC than something as simple as this. Tetris sold Gameboys, not  Nintendo Entertainment Systems.","April 27, 2014","true","7.0"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","28","40","0","0"

In this case those items are jewels that come in 7 different colors.\n\nYou decide how complex you want this basic principle to become by selecting one of the 8 game modes. Some modes are very casual, like 'classic', 'poker' and 'zen'. Others are more intense because they add a timer of some sort to the game board. There is also a 'quest mode' in which you will play all of the game modes in some form, easy versions at first and more difficult with each level. You don't need to finish all of the games of one level in order to play games from the next level, so if there are one or two game modes you don't like, it's no problem to just skip those each time and progress to the next level anyway.\n\nIn each mode, the game will explain clearly what the objective is and what the specific 'twists' for that game mode are.\n\nThe background music is quite nice but you can switch it off through the Options menu if you want.\n\nThere are a lot of Steam Achievements to be had, which adds even more challenges.

Never fails to interest anyone.\n\nGameplay:\nClassic: Match 3 or more for the classic game we all know and love. You can create special gems for a more spectacular effect. Matching four creates a "fire" gem, when used in an "L" style creates a "row-line" destroying gem. Combine 5 to create a "hypercube" which destroys all gems on the field of the same kind and color.\n\nZen: Customize your own experience with sights, sounds and binaural beats to create your own relaxing, never-ending retreat. No timers or pressure.\n\nLightning: Exhilarating, heart pounding race against the clock. Can you extend your time past the 1 minute mark while dramatically increasing your points?\n\nQuest: Experience the ultimate quest with forty magical challenges. Uses a combination of both fun and challenging modes.\n\nUnlockable modes:Butterflies: Do you have an analytical mind and love to solve strategic puzzles? Then this is for you. Some of the gems are transformed into butterflies that move up when another match is made. Be careful when it moves to the top to the spider the game is over.\n\nDiamond Mine: Beat the clock while digging thru rock for relics, gold and silver. Do you have what it takes to collect the riches before time runs out?\n\nIce Storm: Can you destroy the rising columns of water that turn to ice, threatening to quickly freeze the board, thus ending your game? Quick reflexes and careful planning are greatly needed here.\n\nPoker: You build poker hands by having consecutive matches of the same colors. It's a game of chance, since your hands highly depend on the randomness of the current tiles.\nPros:\n+  8 Amazing game modes\n+ Spectacular high def explosions\n+ Great Al voiced in lightning mode\n+ 65 Steam achievements/20 in game badges\n+ Leader board\n+ Ultra-smooth gameplay (no glitches)\n+ Great soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- No multi-player\n- No trading cards\n\nResult / Final Thoughts:\nWhether you're looking for a casual relaxing game, challenging puzzle or a strategic race against the clock, this game can satisfy what you're looking for.  It is a great way to spend time as it’s very addicting. For me, minutes turned into hours. My favorite has to be lightning mode which is also where most of my hours have been spent on. At $5 this game is without a doubt a bargain.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Golden Raffle Group, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.","February 16","true","641.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Branching from a trillogy to two extensive games such as Bejeweled Twist and Bejeweled Blitz (a more competitve version of Lightning). Which I'd also recommend playing if you own a facebook account. Bejeweled 2 & 3 are probably my most favorite to play to this day. Part of it brings me back to my younger days when I had a computer all to myself for the first time and I explored all the different games my parents installed and the ones that were set up by default when you purchased the operating system. In Bejeweled 2, you saw a massive installment in comparison to the first immediately. You could do puzzles and explore beautifully designed planets all while using your head to solve complex puzzles throughout your journey. Also it introduced us to the amazing use of the Hyper Cube and the Flame gem. The art alone still is breathtaking to look at if you played B2 today. As a fellow artist. I can appreciate the amount of skill and determination these developers put in to create these beautiful and stunning planetary landscapes. Now for Bejeweled 3, a whole new world is brought before you in a whole new environment instead of outer space. You are surrounded in ancient marble remains of lost cities and temples along side with some olden statues of mighty animals. All with beautiful animations if your computer can handle the highest settings. B3 brings back "Endless" which has been renamed to "Zen" in this version while a bunch more levels to surpass compared to B2. The rest you will have to try out for yourself to see. Lastly, one thing I admire about the Steam version of B3 is that you can compete with your high scores against your fellow Steam friends. Unlike in the original B3, you could only have a sense of competition if more than one person used your computer and liked playing B3 as much as you do. So with that said. I'd give this game a 10/10 for beautiful art, animation, & addictive gameplay!","August 24, 2014","true","68.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now that I have downtalked the genre for you puzzle haters out there it is time to build up on what is considered an iconic series that has earned its place up with the greats like tetris.\n\nBejeweled is a highly appreciated puzzle game because of the simplicity of its core mechanic, swapping gems. I can already hear you think " yeah tell me someting i didnt know". Well it has inspired many clones to be created if that doesn't show potential I don't know what will. But enough over the cheap and expensive rip offs, this game is a great puzzle game, the variations in game modes can be considered completely new games that really show the beauty of the core mechanic, the way the objectives are set allow you "the player" to think in strategically different ways, from a relaxed slow paced to super tense  -OH NO- moments.\n\nAlthough I myself am a fan of the puzzle league series it is hard for me to adapt my oh so spoiled  keen eye which had to reconstruct the complete scene in seconds to finding combo's and such in this one move per turn game. If Puzzle league is and RTS I consider this game the TBS opposite of it.","March 7, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

These are locked until you've reached a certain level in the various modes and are new exiting variations of Bejeweled (so, Poker is not actual poker). Ice storm is seriously difficult and a must for those who like arm-cramping-speed.\n\nThe graphics are very good even for today’s standard (the original game came out in the 90's); the resolutions are normal (800x600), High (1024x768) and Ultra (1920x1200). You can view the game in boxed or full screen - I prefer it in boxed since it makes the graphics crisper.\n\nThe backgrounds are beautiful and animated - they switch every level..\n\nThere are both in-game badges and steam achievements to earn with the game - which is really nice. :D\n\nThe game provides a lot of versatility and hours of fun - and to great music! I was surprised at how good the soundtrack was and I never get bored of it.\n\nAlso, about the Zen mode: It is not just soft music, it has a number of features like; instead of the music you can e.g. listen to the rain falling on leaves (there are 6 different ambient sounds to listen to besides the very nice music). You can also enable features like breath modulation - with or without visual indicator. Or why not enable mantras; e.g. positive thinking or self-confidence building (6 to choose from and there is also a "subliminal" option for this - which I did not use since, though most mantras were good, some were just hilarious or a bit too narcissistic for me to have subliminally bouncing around my head lol).","June 25, 2014","true","18.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Bejeweled is typically a white-ish powder with a bitter, numbing taste. It is most often insufflated (snorted), though it can also be injected and used orally.\n\nWhile powder Bejeweled can be smoked to some effect (despite common belief otherwise), it is a very inefficient method of ingestion. Because of the high temperatures present when smoking, powder Bejeweled tends to burn rather than vaporizing. For this reason, freebase Bejeweled, also known as crack, is created from powder Bejeweled for smoking. Freebase Bejeweled vaporizes at smoking temperatures providing more effect with less material, as well as faster onset and a more intense high than powder Bejeweled.\n\nIt's a dangerous drug. Nicknames include rock, work, hard, iron, cavvy, base, or just crack. It's said to be the most addictive form of Bejeweled there is. It offers a short (but intense high).","October 7, 2013","true","17.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

(Or Diamond Mine, as it was originally named.)\n\nBejeweled 3, to me, is PopCap at their best. Masterfully made visuals, music and sound effects combine into a mesmerising, entracing, addicting whole. I can spend hours in the groove, sliding gems into plac, hearing the satisfying clacking and tinkling as they fall on top of each other, setting off chain explosions, planning the perfect hypercube a dozen moves in advance.\n\nSteam says I have 66.9 hrs logged, but I've played this game for hundreds of hours before I ever had it on Steam.\n\nNone of the modern free-to-play junk. Here's a full-fledged relaxation game, with several fleshed out modes all based on the simple mechanic of matching gems.\n\nDid I say relaxing? Not all of them are. Some modes leave you with sweaty palms and twitching eyes, searching for that next match, visualising its effect on the whole board, before the timer runs out.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, you have Zen mode, where you can't lose or run out of time, just accruing more and more points and leveling up, while a talisman gets perpetually crafted with each new level. Seriously, every time I think it can't look any more elaborate the game adds more gems to it. I wonder how far it can go.\nThis zen endless mode even comes with optional binaural beats and ambient sound (like forest or rain or beach) for maximum relaxation.\n\nThen there's modes like Poker, where you're not on a time limit but you need to think before each move, to get the best hand possible and stay ahead of the increasing restrictions.\n\nBejeweled 3 falls into the "casual games" genre. And this means a lot of gamers will overlook it or dismiss it as another "game for soccer moms." I mean, it is. But only because it's a game for everyone. It's as casual or as "core" as you want it to be.\n\n(Check my Steam videos for a tiny clip about matching two hypercubes together, a very rare move.)","April 9, 2015","true","66.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game modes are sometimes very difrent from eachother, and therefore you could say the game has a lot of variation. You can play classic mode where you just keep maching jewels, you can play a mining game where you mach jewels to dig down, you can play a freze game where you have to mach jewels to let the ice stay down and many more challenges and gamemodes.\n\nI highly rekomend this game, only becouse of how simple and fun it is, thumps up. 6 out of 10","July 15, 2014","true","46.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though by no means a perfect game, it is a very welcome version of the well known Bejeweled games. There are eight main game modes (of which 4 have to be unlocked) and one of the main modes includes a large amount of new takes on the Bejeweled theme.\n\nThe style of the game is a bit cliche, but the art, music and effects work well together to make it into something loveable. I used to have an old copy of this game on my previous PC and I made a point of buying it again on steam. As one of my few casual games, it never fails to relax and pacify when none of my other games are going well.\n\nI love the music, the games are fun and challenging, it automatically makes a leaderboard with everyone on your list that owns the game, and it makes you feel really awesome when you match a good load of gems.\nAWESOME\nAMAZING\nSPECTACULAR!\n\nDefinitely recommended.","May 21, 2014","true","36.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are incredible and the attention to detail is fantastic. Powered up gems flicker and give off light, and the stage transition looks and runs incredibly well even on my terrible Intel Integrated Graphics Card (which chokes on such intensive games such as They Bleed Pixels and Claydunn X2). The music sounds like something out of an RPG or strategy game. The game greets you every time you start it.\n\nThe basic game mode is straight up match 3 at its purest. No needless microtransactions, no extra powerups to earn, no items to bring down to the bottom, no need to break every single square of the game board. What really makes ther game shine, is the other unique game modes. Poker mode makes it so every match turns into a card. Lightning mode is similar to Bejeweled Blitz. Quest mode has you playing through various unique challenges. The board does not start out with matches. You can also never run out of moves in any mode except in Classic mode. None of these modes really feel too unfair, frustrating, or tedious.\n\nThe only issues I have with the game is that the Zen Mode is kind of tacked on (because all gamers need random motivational quotes to show up on screen while having on an effect that appearently causes nausea!). The other issue is that the entire game is mostly luck based. Though, that's really a problem with the genre itself.\n\nThis game is absolutely worth $10. I will never play Candy Crush again.","March 15, 2014","true","19.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For those who have played Bejeweled Blitz, the ability to make moves while jewels are dropping is a welcome (?) return, giving it a faster paced feel.\n\nMost of the game modes are pretty much brand new, and I highly recommend buying this. $20?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhereIsFibonacci/recommended/78000/","WhereIsFibonacci","[SYG][RMP] ElliottB1 | trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhereIsFibonacci/","38 products in account","Bejeweled 3 is a fun match 3 game. You might have heard of the series and genre before, so let's skip the basics and go straight to the modes:\n\nCLASSIC\nClassic is the most basic mode in the game. Swap gems, match gems, earn points, gain levels, repeat. This process continues until you enter a stalemate (i.e. no possible moves), in which case a booming voice will remind you that you have "no more moves", and the game ends.\n\nZEN\nZen is the easiest mode in the game. It's the exact same as classic mode, except the gems enter the board in such a way that there is always at least one possible move for you. The mode was developed with the help of scientists to help players relax.\n\nLIGHTNING\nThe most popular mode in the game, Lightning is the classic "don't let the timer stop" mode, with a twist. A gem with a number on it has a chance of appearing whenever you destroy other gems. If you manage to match that gem, it will be added to a literal 'time capsule', where once the timer reaches zero, the time in the capsule is released, the score multiplier rises, and the game continues for as long as the time that was in the capsule. Repeat this process until when the timer reaches 0 but there is no time in the capsule, in which case the game will end. It's a simple mode with a long explanation.\n\nQUEST\nQuest is a mode which has almost 40 minigames to challenge you to. You start with only 8 minigames unlocked, but once you complete at least 4 of them, another set of 8 minigames will be unlocked, and then once you complete 4 of those, you unlock the third set, and so on. There are 5 sets of minigames, so it isn't that repetitive. Fun fact: this is the only mode in the game with a backstory behind it, but it isn't mentioned in the game.\n\nThe next modes are secret modes, so unless you've unlocked them all, avoid this section.\n\n\nPOKER\nIn Poker, the board becomes the ultimate poker table as the game becomes more about chance than skill or speed. You're given a hand of 5 blank poker cards. As you make matches, these cards show decals of the gem color matched. The game becomes something out of the movie Inception as now you have to match matches, and better matches give more points. Once all 5 cards have decals on them, the colors are checked, you get your points, and the cards are discarded. There's also skulls in this mode, which I won't bother to explain, but in short, if you get a skull, flip a coin. If heads, keep playing, and if tails, the game ends.\n\nICE STORM\nIn this mode, columns of ice rise up from the bottom of the board. They won't cover the board, but if they hit the top of the board... something rises on the column, and when that hits the top, the board freezes and it's game over. Your task is to stop the columns from hitting the top of the board by making matches over the columns, but if you've been playing for 7 minutes, a column will race up to the top of the board, ending the game instantly.\n\nBUTTERFLIES\nIn Butterflies, colored butterflies will rise up one space every move. Your task is to prevent these butterflies from reaching the top of the board by matching them with gems their color. It's basically Ice Storm, except the columns move at the speed of you.\n\nDIAMOND MINE\nIn Diamond Mine, the board is a driller, and you drill by destroying the ground to the point where the ground is under the line. The mode has an unconventional way of scoring. Instead of gaining points by destroying gems, you gain points by digging up buried treasure, like gold nuggets, diamonds, and mysterious relics possibly related to Quest mode.\n\nThis game is really awesome, but it's kinda repetitive, so I give it a 9/10 for being the best match 3 game ever developed.","March 22","true","22.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

To wipe them away, you create groups of at least three gems by swapping one gem with one located directly beside, above, or below it. This causes those gems to disappear and the ones above to drop down, allowing for new jewels to appear at the top. Matching four or more gems together creates a special gem that will explode and remove surrounding jewels when it is matched; the more jewels matched, the more powerful the explosion. Matching like-colored gems in a T- or L-shaped pattern creates a Box gem that will zap away all gems of a particular color.","August 29, 2014","true","13.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But you have to play either classic, zen, or poker because quest and lightning mode are just frustrating. But then even classic mode sucks because it ends based on if you have any matches or not. So since running out of matches can be out of your control, its random BS. Butterfly mode is the same way: you have to match a specific gem or a spider eats it. Seems like a lot of this game is based around luck and chance. I would say pass and go with another Popcap game, Plants vs Zombies, if you don't want to be infused with anxiety and agitation by this game. Certain modes might make you rage out and punch through a wall. But if you found hookers and cocaine on the other side, it would be worth breaking your fist over.

Don't let anyone tell you it isn't.\n\n3 is mostly the same thing but it is still fun. Zen mode has a lot of different options to fool around with which is cool cause it is the mode I usually play in. There are a lot of different modes to try out - the normal four with four more you can unlock.\n\nMusic is nice and backgrounds are well detailed as well. I do wish there were more backgrounds but I might just be greedy at this point.\n\nBasically I am Bejeweled Trash.","October 18, 2015","true","15.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

It could never be considered one of my favorite games, as my sessions with it are sometimes forgettable.  With this said, forgettable experiences that help me focus on jewels while my stress melts away is sometimes just what the doctor, if he was a gamer, might order.  I'm not quite too embarrassed to admit that many of these gaming sessions have lasted far longer into the early morning than I figured they would/should.  Take this review as you will.

(Bejeweld Twist) they all paled to this or were dumbed down versions of what you find in this..

And I use that for two reasons:\n\n(1)  Like Portal, it takes one schtick - 'match 3' - and finds every possible combination on that to generate minigames and sidequests.  The base mode is mindless fun, while the various other modes run all the way from peaceful zen gaming to time-limited, intensive searching.  Almost every aspect of this game shows that someone at Popcap decided to stop, test, and thnk, making it a smooth, polished experience.  (Polished gemstones...  heh.)\n\n(2)  Like Portal, the voice acting is annoying.\n\nHeartily reccomended.","May 17, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/78000/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Match-3 is about as basic as games get. Seriously, it's the first type of game most people are tasked with creating in game design school. So you've got to make an exceptional match-3 in order to deserve any praise for the task. The two most praised names in match-3 are Puzzle Quest, renowned for turning match-3 into a remarkably fun RPG, and Bejeweled.\n\nThe original Bejeweled was far more basic than Puzzle Quest, featuring a basic match-3 until you have no more matches gametype, and a time attack mode. These persisted into Bejeweled 2, which got a little creative on us, adding in a puzzle mode, some secret extra modes to spice things up, and special gems for matching 4 or 5 gems at once. Still not as unique as Puzzle Quest, but getting there.\n\nSo what sets Bejeweled 3 apart?\n\nTwo things, really. Game modes, which have evolved immensely from the previous two installments, and presentation. The game plays so smoothly. Matching feels great. Explosions feel great. The sound effects and vocal work both sound great. Everything is easy to figure out and menus are not a pain to navigate. B3 is even pleasant to look at.\n\nAs for the game modes, the match until you can't match anymore (Classic) and time attack (Lightning) return once again. Endless mode returns from Bejeweled 2 in the form of "Zen Mode", which is basically the same exact thing as Endless Mode (no end to the game, play as long and as poorly as you please), only with the addition of a set of gimmicky zen features (such as sound and visuals to help control your breathing, and relaxing background noise of the nature variety). Puzzle Mode is gone, and now replaced with a much cooler Quest Mode. In this mode, you are given five set of eight different missions to complete, which can range from quick snippets of one of the game's hidden modes with set goals, to special gametypes unique to this mode, involving things like uncovering artifacts in sand, balancing the number of red and blue gems matched, and turning the entire playfield gold.\n\nI mentioned hidden modes, and yes those are back. Only this time, they're much easier to unlock than in Bejeweled 2, because I guess PopCap realized that keeping people playing longer through added functionality might work better than expecting them to play nearly 300 levels of Endless Mode in order to unlock the basic time attack mode, but with altered scoring.\n\nThe hidden modes of B3 are much better than B2's offerings, as well. Poker Mode is unlocked through Classic Mode, and kind of... well okay, Poker sort of sucks, really. It would be nicer with a larger board or a gem drop algorithm that's slightly more in your favor. In this mode, you try to complete poker hands by making five matches in a row. As you go, skulls will appear over the next-lowest non-skulled hand in the hand info box to the side. You can clear these skulls off by getting enough points, but if you match a hand with a skull over it, a coin flip determines whether you keep playing or game over. And this is what I'm talking about. It really seems as though they added the coin flip in in lieu of making the game a little more playable. It's fun, but sometimes you just don't get enough good gem drops to make decents hands, for several hands in a row.\n\nButterflies Mode is much more fun, and is unlocked by playing Zen Mode for only a little while. In Butterflies, butterfly gems float up the board one space every time you make a move. If they reach the top and stay there for too long, the board freezes and you lose, but you can clear them by matching them with other gems. Ice Storm has you fighting off continuously rising pillars of ice by matching gems in their columns. Horizontal matches don't lower the pillars much, but can hit multiple at once, whereas vertical matches will only hit one pillar, but will drop it to the bottom of the screen. Special gems have varying results.\n\nDiamond Mine is my favorite mode to play. In this one, you have block of dirt on the bottom of the screen, and must clear them by making matches next to them or hitting them with special gems. Clearing all rows above a certain line drops the line down further and adds precious seconds to the timer. As you dig, you'll collect gold and ancient artifacts which will add to your score.\n\nAlso, there are star gems now. Created for making a horizontal and vertical match with one gem, these take out the entire row AND column that they occupy when matched.\n\nThe leaderboards are interesting, and took me a little while to figure out. I initially thought they had glitched up. Turns out, your top score is saved as your Steam display name, and all lower scores are saved under your in-game name. None of my friends have played this yet, but I'm willing to assume that only your top score is displayed on your friends' boards, but your own extra scores are there for you to personally see and improve upon.\n\nMy biggest complaint is simply an issue that comes with the match-3 territory, and that's that sometimes you'll lose for just no good reason at all. This ties into my complaint with Poker Mode. The issue is that sometimes you'll desperately need a thing that just won't drop, or you need to make a match on the opposite side of the board, but the gems seem to only want to fall in a pattern which keeps you on the wrong side and oh look time's up. I would rage if I cared more.\n\nIf you want match-3 with an adventure and a story, Puzzle Quest is the way to go. If you just want to match gems and maybe do it in some unique and fun ways, then Bejeweled 3 is the best way to do so that I have personally found.","April 21, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Incredibly, such game had me hooked for 1.5 hours straight and still manages to intice me to play some some more.\n\nGameplay is reminiscent of other puzzle games with a few twists in store. The aim of bejeweled is to match 3 of the same shapes together horizontally or vertically. You do this by swapping two shapes through clicking on one shape and then the other one. Each match removes the row of shapes, earns points and allows other shapes above to drop down. You can improve your score by doing combos (which is matching one shape, causing other shapes to match as well). Should you match a group of 4 or more shapes, the shapes will become charged up. When charged up shapes are matched with the same shapes, they explode, destroying shapes in a area around it and earing extra points.  When you are struggling to find a match, you can click on the 'Hint' button which indicates a shape you can move to form a match. There are various game modes such as a casual (no timer or set objectives), challenges (must meet objectives to pass), endless mode etc.Extra game modes can be unlocked by meeting a set score in previous game modes. With plenty of game modes to play, unlock as well as achievements to gain, there is plenty of replayability available.\n\nMusic instills a feeling of serenity. Calm music is played, which is great for calming yourself when solving puzzles. Sound effects for matches and explosions are good as well. The announcer who basically shouts comments based on how well you play (number of combos), reminds me of the announcer from Mortal Combat (which is a plus).\n\nGraphics are colourful. The 2D graphics are vibrant and eye catching.\n\nAs with many puzzle games there is no story, which isn't necessary anyway.\n\nIf you want to play a puzzle game that will have you hooked, you will not be dissapointed with Bejeweled 3.","April 20, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is comforting and the gameplay modes can switch from puzzles to frantic action to (literally) zen relaxation.  The real hook beyond the extremely easy to grasp game mechanics is the sense of reward as the game moves on.  It's very easy to stack up big winning combos and there's a huge amount of satisfaction in pulling off the 4 and 5 in-a-row matches and the amount of fireworks you can set off as a result is gives a big smile inducing shot of addiction.\n\nBejeweled 3 is just plain simple addicting fun.","July 7, 2011","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are various game modes such as a casual (no timer or set objectives), challenges (must meet objectives to pass), endless mode etc.Extra game modes can be unlocked by meeting a set score in previous game modes. With plenty of game modes to play, unlock as well as achievements to gain, there is plenty of replayability available.\n\nMusic instills a feeling of serenity. Calm music is played, which is great for calming yourself when solving puzzles. Sound effects for matches and explosions are good as well. The announcer who basically shouts comments based on how well you play (number of combos), reminds me of the announcer from Mortal Combat (which is a plus).\n\nGraphics are colourful. The 2D graphics are vibrant and eye catching.\n\nAs with many puzzle games there is no story, which isn't necessary anyway.\n\nIf you want to play a puzzle game that will have you hooked, you will not be dissapointed with Bejeweled 3.","April 20, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though I'm more acquainted with playing on it on a phone or tablet, the transition was rather smooth and enjoyable.\n\nI've always enjoyed puzzle-style games, and Bejeweled has to be one of my favorites. I didn't think they could top 2, but they really outdid themselves here.\n\nThere are 7 modes of this game, plus the extra "quest" mode that incorporates more challenging versions of all 7 modes, as well as a few extra for added fun. With unlimited replay, and no two levels the same, it's hard not to waste hours playing this game in one go. Most of the modes/challenges will be familiar to anyone already familiar with Bejeweled game--the lightning blitz, butterflies, the mines, and even the more recent poker. There's also a few that were new to me, such as Ice Storm, a quick-paced game where your goal is to knock down the ice columns by making matches before the ice rises to the top and freezes the whole board.\n\nIn my opinion, the price is more than worth the game.","May 15, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Almost every aspect of this game shows that someone at Popcap decided to stop, test, and thnk, making it a smooth, polished experience.

It's everything you could want in this series: addictive, pretty to look at, rewarding with lots of fun achievements, and multiple playable modes to give you a healthy challenge when you get bored. The different modes have different strategies to 'win' each one, so it gives your mind a little bit more of a workout than the typical one-mode Bejeweled web version or simple app. Quest mode is a fun little butt-kicker.\n\nIt's by far my favorite time-waster; Zen mode, especially, is a great little thing when you just need to sit and think on something. This game gets some flack for being so 'casual,' but nothing beats this mode for pleasant background noise while you're trying to battle through a creative project.\n\nIt won't change your life, but if you're gonna get a version of Bejeweled it should be this one.","October 26, 2015","true","69.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can even use binaural (sp?) beats, provided that you have headphones. I haven't tried that yet.\n\nI'm not a fan of the timed challenges, so I'm glad that they are balanced out by move limitations. Butterflies is a nice touch. Relaxing with a cute feel.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashtv/recommended/78000/","smashtv","VTX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smashtv/","136 products in account","Simply put: this is the game I wish all the other Bejeweled games could have been.\n\nGem SwappingOverall, the gem-swapping engine has been tweaked (or overhauled, I don't know), and it's obvious some serious thought was put into ironing out all the minor frustrations I've had with it. You can swap any gem at almost any time except when they're actively falling down the board. This means you can swap a gem into a falling column of other gems, make swaps while board animations are happening, and in a few other surprising places. It feels very polished (no pun intended).\n\nGame ModesPretty much every mode from the first and second games are in there, plus a mode called Lightning that's very much like Bejeweled Blitz (though improved also, with no annoying Facebook tie-in), and a couple other non-timed modes that are seriously challenging and fun.\n\nThe new non-timed modes include Poker, in which you create "hands" of cards by strategically matching gems. Butterflies has insect-gems that swap themselves upward on the board each time the player moves, and the game's over if the spider at the top catches any.\n\nDiamond Mine uses gem swaps to dig through dirt in search of treasure; clearing out enough dirt adds a bit of time to the countdown. Ice Storm features rising columns of ice behind the board that is shattered by swapping gems over them; if any columns freeze, the game is over.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics this time around are built for HD resolutions, and it makes a surprising difference. Going all the way up to 1080p the art lines were sharp and not distorted. Previous games were limited to specific 4:3 resolutions.\n\nThe hardware-accelerated effects seem more balanced this time around. In Bejeweled 2, the lighting from the special gems would become so intense you couldn't tell what color any gem around it was anymore. This led to me disabling hardware acceleration entirely, which was a shame since it looked so good otherwise. It's on by default in Bejeweled 3, and the only time I've had difficulty is during other effects from different game modes, which is a huge improvement.\n\nIt runs at a really smooth framerate on my laptop, but I'm on an Alienware 17 with a decent mobile graphics card. The game drops frames on Butterflies mode when there's a lot going on at once, but is otherwise great. On my wife's laptop (a Sony VAIO from 2010) it's a little less smooth, but still fully playable.\n\nOverallI'll be playing this game over other Bejeweled versions from now on. It's got some high replayability due to the various badges. Most have multiple levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) so they're actually fun to try for.","June 13, 2015","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As basic as it is, Bejeweled 3 has me beating a level, then saying to myself "one more level," which then turns into 5 more levels. With several modes and minigames, it seems that there is much to go around for $5.00, and I'm sure I would find myself playing this games for many hours at a time if it wasn't for one thing: hints.\n\nThere is a big button on the left of every level titled "hints," which I can click on as many times as I want for the game to tell me what move to make. This doesn't bother me, but what does bother me is the automatic hints. If I take about maybe 15-20 seconds to decide on my move, the game will actually tell me what to choose, which definitely removes the whole point of even playing this game. I don't know what PopCap was thinking, because this feature not only demotivates me from playing, but it makes me feel like I didn't complete the level by myself, and that's true.\n\nPopCap support has released a statement reguarding the issue: "The hunt function is built into the game and cannot be disabled."\n\nSeriously, this feature ruins the whole game for me. Why is there even a giant hint button on the screen if you're just going to give me the hint every turn anyway? That is beyond ridiculous and borderline stupid.\n\nThis game also supports only 4:3 aspect ratio resolutions, yet you can still play this game at 16:9, so that's not a big deal for me, which is why I'm only focusing on the hints. I only recommend this game to people who can deal with these issues.\n\nI'm going to make one thing clear: I DON'T WANT THE GAME TO PLAY FOR ME!","August 20, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's everything you could want in this series: addictive, pretty to look at, rewarding with lots of fun achievements, and multiple playable modes to give you a healthy challenge when you get bored. The different modes have different strategies to 'win' each one, so it gives your mind a little bit more of a workout than the typical one-mode Bejeweled web version or simple app. Quest mode is a fun little butt-kicker.\n\nIt's by far my favorite time-waster; Zen mode, especially, is a great little thing when you just need to sit and think on something. This game gets some flack for being so 'casual,' but nothing beats this mode for pleasant background noise while you're trying to battle through a creative project.\n\nIt won't change your life, but if you're gonna get a version of Bejeweled it should be this one.","October 26, 2015","true","69.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some levels require you to perform specific tasks.\nB3 is similar to Candy Crush and many others although they are mostly for Android.\n\nThe good:\n1. Unlike its main competitors this is not a pay to win game.  You pay once and that gives you access to all content.  However, the competitors are free to play.\n2. Some of the quests are interesting.  I liked the poker game and the one where you save butterflies.\n\nThe bad:\n3. Most levels are quite dull and uninteresting.  Others are quite irritating, especially when you go against the clock.\n4. Not a bright, colorful or visually exciting as its competitors.\n\nThe ugly:\n5.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GRules7/recommended/78000/","GRules7","GRules7","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GRules7/","331 products in account","First off, I just want to say that this game is very fun to play. As basic as it is, Bejeweled 3 has me beating a level, then saying to myself "one more level," which then turns into 5 more levels. With several modes and minigames, it seems that there is much to go around for $5.00, and I'm sure I would find myself playing this games for many hours at a time if it wasn't for one thing: hints.\n\nThere is a big button on the left of every level titled "hints," which I can click on as many times as I want for the game to tell me what move to make. This doesn't bother me, but what does bother me is the automatic hints. If I take about maybe 15-20 seconds to decide on my move, the game will actually tell me what to choose, which definitely removes the whole point of even playing this game. I don't know what PopCap was thinking, because this feature not only demotivates me from playing, but it makes me feel like I didn't complete the level by myself, and that's true.\n\nPopCap support has released a statement reguarding the issue: "The hunt function is built into the game and cannot be disabled."\n\nSeriously, this feature ruins the whole game for me. Why is there even a giant hint button on the screen if you're just going to give me the hint every turn anyway? That is beyond ridiculous and borderline stupid.\n\nThis game also supports only 4:3 aspect ratio resolutions, yet you can still play this game at 16:9, so that's not a big deal for me, which is why I'm only focusing on the hints. I only recommend this game to people who can deal with these issues.\n\nI'm going to make one thing clear: I DON'T WANT THE GAME TO PLAY FOR ME!","August 20, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 23\nBejeweled 3\nPurchase Date: 3/6/2014\n\nMatch 3 puzzle games have been around a long time, and Bejeweled is one of the older series of these games.  If you ever played that awful Candy Crush Saga, then you can think of Bejeweled as it's much less obnoxious uncle.\n\nBejeweled 3 is a match 3 game first, and not a mobile game, so thankfully it doesn't have a lot of the annoying mechanics that you find in the typical mobile game.  It's not begging you to add friends or buy gems or enticing you to click on a picture of Kate Upton's boobs to download the latest version of Fire Age.  Bejewled 3 gives you a screen full of gems, and it wants you to match 3 of them, and that's as complicated as it gets.\n\nIn fairness, I should add that this version of Bejewled does come with 8 different game modes.  4 of these you get immediately, and as you progress in each game mode you will unlock an additional game mode.  So it does vary up the gameplay somewhat.  Some of the game modes are timed, while others are more strategic.  It also has a Zen mode where you can just mindlessly match gems as long as you want.\n\nSo the important question you need to ask yourself is, do you like matching gems?  Because if you like matching gems, then this game is for you.  If you don't like matching gems, then you should stop reading this review and get back to playing Fire Age.","July 20, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
