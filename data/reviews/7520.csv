This time I cannot agree because the first hours I started this game I had so much fun.\nIt reminds me of Ultima and Morrowind. The world is really open and huge and even if you follow the main story you have plenty of possibilties to explore on your own.\nDirect from the beginning you can have a huge profit if you start reading the books and looting the chests you find and the artwork is really stunning even for todays standards.\nThe opening cinematic is really nice and made you feel really part of the world.\n\nThe crafting system is fun because useless items give you resources and this resources you can use to upgrade your valueable items.\nLike in Morrowind you can develop your character while you play and you are not restricted to only one class.\nIf you read the turorial messages it give you all information about key bindings and while it's sometimes annoying at the beginning to make your character do what you want him/her to do, but like in real life after some practice you become comfortable with it.\n\nThere is a lot of character interaction, but it never gets annoying because you don't  have to read pages of gossip.\nIf you want more information about subjects you can read the books or buy the strategy guides on Steam.\n\nI bought the game long time ago before it was on sales on Steam and don't regret. I bought the strategy guides now just to tell the devs I really like this game.\n\nMost important of all is that I really think the devs have passion for their project and that's what you can see in every single part of the game. I don't understand people rating this so negative without explaining what is so wrong about the game just because they were asked for their profile when starting the game. Get over it.\n\nIf you like exploring every part of the world in your own story with your own character doing what you like to do and want a huge adventure with fighting monsters and explore secrets don't think twice to get this chem now when it's on sale.\n\n","July 28, 2015","true","12.3"," 195 of 228 people (86%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","86","195","228","10","4"

Sometimes, the combat is an absolute joy because it is a tad wonkly and I had many laughs because of it.\nHorses still suck AND there's no horse combat. Not even one step forward, huh? 2 steps back and that's it. Meh.\nVisuals are fine, but some character models are just gross.\nVoice overs still suck, but who cares.\nUI kinda sucks, but it's usable. Hell, I think MechWarrior's UI 2.0 is just fine, so take my opinion for what it's worth.\nStill a ton of bugs, just like Two Worlds I.\n\nNow the good.\n\nHUGE improvements on everything, even on the things that still kinda suck. Within the context of this series, that's a good thing. At least they learned.\nOH MY GOD the magic! The combos for magic, warrior abilities, and archer/thief stuff is great. SO MANY POSSIBILITIES. I dig that, I really do.\nBig map, lots of baddies to kill. I like.\nThe teleportation system is 10x better and more reminiscent of something out of TES. That's a good design, keep it, it works.\nAnd the quest system is great and the story is...eh, not so horrible. It's not great, but it'll do.\nCharacter customization is waaaay better, and that's good.

Just dont log out until you beat it or get sick of it, or you may have to re-enter your serial YET AGAIN and if you get your registration info wrong the second time dont expect to be playing it very much...\n\nIronically I read an article indicating there was a no-cd hack made for this that removed the serial check, and fixed some other game breaking bugs too.  The orignal makers of the game couldn't do this for the steam version... why exactly?   Who knows.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sheldin/recommended/7520/","Sheldin","Sheldin ヨアキム","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sheldin/","110 products in account","Two Worlds II is your typical fantasy adventure/RPG game with loads of enemies, challenges, things to do, average story-telling & plot, mediocre graphics and a very grindy multiplayer. However.. Even though this game has got some flaws it does deliver on some areas which makes it all worth the while.\n\nAs far as the single-player story goes it's nothing special, really. It's very generic and the character you play as is very easy to forget about (lacking background-story, no real connection). None of the main characters really stand out. Instead, those who you talk to once in a while are those with the most memorable dialog and unique sense of humour - which is a neat change of pace.\n\nWhen you venture out in the singleplayer world it's easy to let go of what you were doing and just hunt for enemies only to use your skills, no matter what you specialize in at the time whether it be magic, archery, melee combat or all three. They are all equally as fun to play, even though the magic-system in this game is by far the most worked on.\n\nYou conjure your own spells by using cards which you can combine in almost any way you can think of. You can create spells which summon creatures to fight for you, spells which summon tornados which in turn summons heavy steel anvils - at the same time as it's spinning around throwing the anvils all around the place. Or if you're more into projectiles you can create spells which shoot out several projectiles that are either homing or simply bounces through target to target hitting multiple enemies with only one projectile. OR; combine it all - projectile -> anvile summoning -> Tornado. Great fun!\n\nHowever, this game is not only about singleplayer, even though it's great fun. You can also join your friends on Multiplayer where the game turns into somewhat of a grind-fest and all you do - basically - is repeat mission in order to gain levels and increase the strength of your character. Yes, it's tedious.. But with the right people the multiplayer turns into a very much appreciated hang-out. You have several game-modes ranging from the typical story-mission style to sruvival and even town-management. Yes, you can build your bery own town/village and you have to manage it in order to keep your villagers happy. And you friends can join you in your village, to either help you out when you need to defend it or to see how you manage your village compared to theirs.\n\nThere's also PvP in this game, but my experience with the PvP has been very bad which in the long run made me ignore it completely, so I'm not gonna comment on it.\n\n\nAll in all it's a great game. The graphics are very dated since the game is old, but even though it looks "bad" it still delivers on key points; massive world(s), great environment, huge variety of enemies, great skill-set and system, basic crafting and upgrading system and more. It's a great game when you want to kill time or play something quick and easy with your friends.\n\nI've enjoyed every minute put into this game, and I believe some of you will as well.

Think Gothic but without interesting characters or a world that makes you care about. While I realize that's not a glowing recommendation, most of the game is actually enjoyable. The side-quests are interesting, and there are some genuinely funny moments. Unfortunately, you're never really *in* the game, because conversations are abysmal. The voice-acting is very poor, as are the conversation animations. You have to constantly refer to your journal for synopses, because the in-game dialogue is sometimes borderline nonsensical and leaves one wondering what actually just happened.\n\nAll that aside, it's perfectly possible to get tens of hours of solid gameplay out of this title...until you come to the final boss. I won't offer spoilers, but I will say that the mechanics of the final boss fight essentially toss aside all of the character building you've worked towards. The RPG elements die, only to be replaced by a clunky FPS/potion management test. Due to the game's refusal to let you save during the final battle, you will also be subjected to the final cutscreen each re-try (and there will be many, many re-tries if you actually want to win).\n\nIn other words, it starts out clunky, gets decent without ever being really good, and then ends with the least enjoyable boss fight I've ever encountered in a game.\n\nI suppose the good news is that the characters are so unrelateable and uninteresting that I never felt compelled to power-through and beat the final boss, so on the positive side, at least you don't feel like you've lost too much if you never find out how the story ends.\n\nIf you have to play the game, just stop at the final boss and look online for a final cutscreen.","August 12, 2014","false","72.9"," 86 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","86","103","3","0"

I feel like many people didn't understand my first, so here's a second one, more simple to understand. First of all, yes, Two Worlds 2 is not a polished game. Is not your Bethesda RPG (although their games are still very buggy, the mechanics are solid), nor it tries to be. TW2 is awful in many aspects, but it shines in others and it can be a very enjoyable experience if you can deal with its flaws. It does its own thing and it's good enough at it, being 100% worth the PRICE AT DISCOUNTS (I think I paid something around USD4,00 for the Velvet Edition). I wouldn't recommend it at full price, but for more than 30h of gameplay to explore such an interesting and beautiful world, it certainly is worth the bargain I paid for it.\n\nOh, and btw! The DRM is not as concerning as some people put it. It is offensive, but you DO NOT have to give accurate information (I didn't and it worked out alright). Just put something random there, or skip it entirely (yes, you don't have to go through that at all if you don't like it). In all honestly, there are worse DRMs to be worried about out there, like Denuvo, whatever Blizzard uses in Diablo 3 and whatever EA has and will use.","November 20, 2015","true","60.8"," 79 of 97 people (81%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","81","79","97","12","0"

There is a lot going for this game and it really is an improvement on the first game in the series.\nI thought the main character was a hoot. I loved the very dry but funny comments he made throughout the game. I liked the side quests, they were interesting and entertaining and usually quite unpredictable in how they would turn out.\nI enjoyed the storyline, I certainly didn't want to stop playing until I got to the end and I was tempted to do a lot of side missions along the way.\nThe horses were a bit of a fail (never around) as was fighting in the small corridors. Terrible camera angles meant I couldn't always see my character at all and he was getting stuck in corners and having the stuffing pummelled out of him while I blindly tried pressing keys trying to get him up and away from walls, corners or holes.\nThe inventory was a bit of a mess, the idea of armour sets nice but it was too easy to dismantle an item and then when you switch armour sets find yourself left standing in the nuddy with only your bow and a small dagger. (Hehe)(Pun intended)\n\nI will say this. I would be replaying this game over and over if I had the option to play as a female. I wouldn't want to stop until I experienced all the classes and their armours/weapon combinations. I would also have been very interested in buying the dlc and/or any expansions. I think RPG developers should give serious consideration to us female gamers as consumers with spending power. I liked the game but playing as a male... there is no replay interest for me.\n\nOverall I'm glad I played this game though.

It offers my favorite lockpicking mini game of all time and crafting was alright as well.  Some awful mechanics like pickpocketing as well, the one quest where you're required to pickpocket I gave up and murdered everyone involved. I still got rewarded for "pickpocketing" the bodies.  I hear crafting magic is amazing as well but I didn't go that route.\n\nThat said, after slugging through about 60 hours of gameplay, exploring the world and being rewarded for playing a terrible character, I reached the final boss.  All of your character progression is meaningless.  Regardless of your HP, fire immunity, and Melee skill, this boss will remove a third of your HP with every shot and remain airborne requiring either a magic affinity that is strong enough to damage the final boss but not strong enough to crash the game (I read this one on the internet as respecking is an option, it may have been patched) or the use of the ballista inexplicably placed on top of the bosses tower.  I tried multiple times to beat the boss but, after I reduced its HP to less than a third, it started using an undodgeable attack which always reduced my HP down to Zero.  It took me 3 tries to realize it might be a bug and abandon the game.\n\nTopware also has some aggressive DRM, requiring personal information like your full name, address, and phone number to enable the save feature.  I got a bundle with 3 Tripwire games in it, all 3 of them having the same requirements for personal information.","November 25, 2013","false","66.8"," 178 of 268 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","178","268","0","6"

I really liked the first Two Worlds and TW2 is almost as good, but there are a few things that really bothered me.\nThe controls seem like they were made for a console game and at times it is rather difficult to have good control with mouse and keyboard even with customization. E.g. run, block and sneak are all on the same key, often causing confusion in the heat of battle (it is less than ideal when you are trying to get some space between you and an attacker and you end up trying to block instead).\nThe game also clearly seems to give meelee fighters an advantage over casters and archers. My favorite play style is that of a stealthy archer. You can not do that in this game. Sneak attacks can only be done with daggers. Archery in general is rather difficult as the auto aim can not be turned off and it does not know how to aim ahead of a moving target, causing even a high level archer to constantly miss even low level and even slow moving targets from relatively close distance. It is a bit better with sniper mode from a great distance (where auto aim does not lock), but it is really annoying nevertheless. Also there is no first person mode, so your characters elbow tends to get into the way, blocking your view of enemies.\nFinally there were also quite a few bugs (dialogue skipping, and wrong shaders getting loaded occasionally, among others) that cost this game points.\nOn the positive side, I really enjoyed the story (which unfortunately felt a little rushed in the end) and the many side quests all of which are well written and entertaining.  The crafting system is simple and fun.\nI loved the lack of classes and the freedom to customize your character skills. There is a lot to explore and discover, which is always nice. The graphics are quite good, though not outstanding for todays standards. All in all a good game for RPG players looking for something to spend some time on. I got it for a real bargain around Christmas and I would definitely recommend it for that price. I would not buy it for the full 19,90 it is costing right now, though. Better wait for another special again.","February 19, 2015","true","127.4"," 68 of 98 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","68","98","7","0"

It is not without it's rough edges however, and you'll want to play it on the hardest setting to help guard against your almost Godlike attributes too early in the game. The voice-acting is cringe worthy at times, but it is ok for the most part, and the ai can be extremely predictable and too easily defeated on normal and lower difficulties.\n\nThe greatest strength of TW2 is that it get's more right than it get's wrong, and it is all packaged in very good looking graphical wrapping. It is just a blast to play - period, at least for me, and this alone should be enough for any fan of open world RPG's. Make no mistake, this is NOT Skyrim, but it is a very adequate and capable RPG that will keep you questing, looting, and killing, for dozens and dozens of hours.\n\nGet the Velvet Edition. The DLC is spectacular, and is almost better in many regards than the base game - just not as long obviously.\n\nBase game = 8.5/10\nVelvet Edition = 9.0/10\n\nDisclaimer:\nNo animal or Human was harmed in the making of this - opinion.","December 9, 2013","true","278.2"," 56 of 78 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","56","78","0","0"

I think it may be because they designed it for 3D.  Even though I cannot play it in 3D, I can feel the graphic design quality.\nCharacters are mostly well acted.\nThe spell system is very creative.  You can combine different modifiers that custom alter your spells, but many times applying the alterations creates completely different spells altogether.\nThe game allows you to quickly switch between three different outfits with the touch of a button.  I didn't think I would like this at first, but it allows me to play warrior, mage, and archer/sneak as the situation allows.  I have specialized gear for all three roles and it actually works.\nIt has really creative quests without being the go and fetch variety.  When the rare occasion of running errands arises, the story line has a compelling reason and makes you want to do it.\nIf you like old-school, dark, un-mapping (as in you need graph paper) dungeons, there is  a unique challenge in chapter one that lets you try your hand at it.  It is not necessary for the story line, so that is optional.\nI'm a huge fan of Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.  It's no Elder Scrolls, but I would give it a 90/100.\nWhatever bugs existed at release have been smoothed out for the Steam version and the game hasn't given me a single problem for over 70 hours of play.\n\nAnd it is huge!  I am in the middle of the second chapter with much left to go.  I am a person that does every little quest, so I figure I have about 100 hours left in this thing.\n\nI have no idea why I never heard of this game and don't hear people talking about it.\n\nHave fun with this hidden treasure!\n","January 26, 2014","true","121.0"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","40","52","0","0"

Therefore making this game a visually pleasing and fun to play. I haven't encountered any bugs, so, so far so good.\n\nThe game lacks 'something' but cant put my finger on what that 'something' is. The keyboard mapping is confusing such as sprint and sneak are the same button. You need to stand still and press RMB for sneak and move and press RMB to sprint. So the keyboard layout it a bit weird. The prologue took 45 minutes to complete... I think 1 hour ingame until I was able to free roam!\n\nHowever once you get to free roam it can be very enjoyable, there map is relitevly large and you do get a horse about 3 hours of gameplay in.. The map doesnt require a horse though as you recieve a teleport pad at the end of the prologue so you can fast travel to locations you've already discovered.\n\nMake sure you keep up with you crafting and enchanting as you level up rather quickly, therefore so do you foes. So dont do a me and get slaughtered and wonder why... "Oh, I am using a damage 10 sword when I couldve upgraded it to 40 by now."\n\nOnce you understand what you're doing in the game, such as how to craft and how to dismantle items to game becomes rather enjoybale.\n\nI havent played too much of the story to give a verdict, but on the whole for £2, I am really enjoying this game, I would say the game is worth about... £6. I wouldnt spend more than that, when Skyrim is only about £10 these days.

Well, it obviously is not as good as Skyrim ,yet it has its own qualities, The unique quality was the magic system, where we can create our own spells and experiment with them, well that's better than learning a destruction spell by simply opening a book. It has varying landscapes such as A Desert, A Swamp, Dense forest, Asian city, Dark ruins , Islands. etc.  But the story is meh! specially the ending, the main quest is good as well as the side quests, but there are huge number of these kind of quests of many of them are fetch quests which tends to get boring after completing many. Tried the multiplayer a bit, its simple you can alone do a quest or with your friend, and there are different modes like death match etc.  I heard the multiplayer will be disabled soon, hope it dosent. I may have missed some points like fighting mechanics and crafting system which are "OK" at best!

Cannot get enough of it, something about upgrading weapons, armor & gems just keeps me interested. The combat system, when you get used to it, is very rewarding and fun - while I still face some challenges I do feel like a badass now that I have properly levelled up and use the right gems, armor and weapons. Decided to go full warrior class so packed everything into strength and a little into endurance.\n\nPros:\n1. The quests are WAY more interesting than some of the typical RPG quests with some pretty entertaining and, dare I say, mature storylines.\n2. The graphics & sound is absolutely remarkable.\n3. Variety of things to do i.e. tomb raiding, fighting, hunting, horse riding, sailing, upgrading items, shopping etc. (keeps me entertained for long periods of time).\n4. As stated in my opening remarks, the combat system is fantastic and if attacks are timed with defense the results are some excellent fighting routines. The enemies also have certain defense such as blunt force vs cutting damage so when facing say a Skeleton it is better to use a hammer than a sword. It is important to see / know what your enemies are "immune to" so changing weapons is a must to quickly end fights, especially when surrounded (something which the Witcher series uses i.e. silver vs steel)\n5. While I am full on warrior, should I wish to switch to range (rogue) or magick (mage) I can use a soul patcher and simple respec my character.\n6. The magick system from what I have seen (not experienced myself yet, is the best in it's class - more like Oblivion than Skyrim - where custom made spells are possible, only your imagination is the limit.\n7. The different areas are amazing from totally unique (lush islands with gorgeous flora which reacts to your movements, the savana, the deserts, the dungeons, the old ruins, the swallows etc.) each region feels totally unique with even the music adapting accordingly.\n\nCons:\n1. You can see in some instances that the budget behind this game vs other more well know games is less, not based on sound or graphics but rather things like path finding for enemies which can be pretty dumb at times.\n2. AI is somethings lacking (and here is a pro tip for folks in the early game) where the enemies have a limited chase distance where they simply reach the edge of this limit and will sometimes just stand there and take arrow or magick damage until they die. (Which was especially useful when facing the giant scorpions for the first time although I did feel a little dirty using this game glitch)\n3. Probably as a result of the first point but some of the caves / dungeons are reused but not nearly as bad as Dragon Age 2\n4. Possibly a tad challenging in the early stages so kiting is recommended (hit and run tactics)\n\nI honestly cannot think of why this game has some negative reviews but have noticed that most, if not all are well under 10 hours of gameplay ergo they probably got smashed trying to button mash enemies.\n\nThis game deserves a 9 out of 10 easily but not being a big budget & influential development house who can pay of the mainstream reviewers I guess it gets a bad rep.\n\nGet it and immerse yourself in something trully rewarding - you will not regret it.\n\n","February 21","true","104.6"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","1"

Overall well-executed and solid (not what you would expect of Two Worlds franchise, huh?) Though it has it downsides, of that below. But short summary - yes, the game is good.\n\nTwo Worlds 2 in many ways reminds me of Gothic series. Free roaming, ability to climb rocks, ability to beat strong enemies, loot and steal everything, sensible NPCs and a right feel of progression. Not exactly there, but this is the best experience in open-world RPGs I've got since those times. On top of that, excellent graphics and animations (oh, pity that with such great combat animations game has such crappy combat mechanics!) and good story and side quests - you feel involved and always have a reason to intervene.\n\nBad things. 1) The redundant key entering and invasive registration form (do not fill that, it's unnecessary!). Almost ragequite after some unsuccesful registration attempts; thankfully, continued. No drm-client, at least. 2) The game claims to be open-world, but in fact you are limited to plot zones, though they are large and free to roam. And there is next to nothing to explore outside of key locations. So it's more correct to perceive this game as story-driven RPG, but without rails and corridors. 3) Game is exploitable in a lot of ways. Kiting, click spamming, paralizing, poor aggro handling, patrol limits - all of that makes combat unchallengeable and boring. Having tons of health of the enemies doesn't help with boring. Heard there are mods that improve combat and difficulty level, but haven't tried them.\n\nOverall, the game was fun. Little grindy, but I don't mind to kite mobs a little - loot is good as a reward. Good controls, freedom to go, believable world, good story and quests.

I purchased an RPG bundle because of a game in the mix that I thought looked enjoyable, Two Worlds II came with it and the videos looked alright.\n\nI have quite a bit of experience when it comes to RPGs and gaming in general working on developing my own games, software, etc.. over the years. If I could change one purchase I made at full price, I would've pre-ordered this game at full price rather than buy Arcania ( Gothic 4 ) on pre-order; never again from that company. Gothic 4 is one of the worst games, it is so full of bugs that you can't even walk down a small slope because you keep hitting invisible walls that stops you befor letting you continue. Two Worlds II is actually quite refined.\n\nI haven't played it in a while, but I ended up buying it 3 times ( One bundle had the standard edition, and the Pirates DLC, and then I bought another bundle with the Epic edition, then once for a friend because I enjoyed it so much ). I'd buy it again.\n\nThere are a few downsides to the game, but they're so minimal I can't even remember them.\n\nThis game seems very polished, I may have encountered a bug that I couldn't replicate. Gameplay is smooth, combat is simple when you get used to it, the controls don't feel clunky like Gothic 4 ( where you can spam pick-up and the character does 20 squats before picking up the item and where hitting enemies is a chore ).\n\nI'd rate this to be almost as much fun as Skyrim. The game has plenty of side-quests, twists, and more. I don't recall whether or not I cleared out 100% of the game, but at over 100 hours of time in game says something. The price I paid wouldn't have even gotten me a movie ticket, or a popcorn at the movies, at that was with buying it 3 times; For a game from 2011, it definitely plays quite well.\n\nIf you think the price of a few coffees, a movie ticket, or a few soft-drinks is worth it, consider the cost to entertainment value for a game like this and buy it. If you're on the fence about the $20 price-tag, wait until it is on sale ( the bundle sites still have it too at a steal ) but at $10, it is more than worth it.","November 13, 2014","true","104.2"," 37 of 59 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","37","59","4","0"

There was nothing requested that is any more than what your local pizza delivery place likely has on you.\n\nOn to the review:\nBeginner tutorials are so uninformative that the NPC training you will give you a book in whichever skill (alchemy, spell casting, etc.) to cover the information the designers knew they failed to address properly to begin with.\n\nStiff, halting dialogue from bad voice actors.\n(E.G. Thome the Scribe sounds like Droopy Dog with a Southern drawl.)\nStiff character models combined with loose joystick and limited/ unimaginative controls make combat feel like a sloppy button masher.\n\nAbout half the mobs I encountered died too easy and the other half were damage sponges and others simply stood there until my firebolts killed them.\n\nSpell types (Elemental types, Necromancy, Summoning, etc.) require books to learn and then certain card types to combine into an amulet for castable spells.\nFor instance, you could select an element card like Fire and then combine with a "carrier" card such as Bolt, Spray or Area Effect.\nHaving determined I would play as a mage type, I originally thought this was implemented nicely but then I was finding next to no books or cards except random rotations on vendors, which charged an exhorbitant sum when and if they even had anything I could use.\n\nScrewy quests that are nonsensical even beyond the played-out fetch quests common to RPG games.\nExample:\nThe first town I came to was Bayan.\nWithin the first couple of minutes, I had three people beg me for meat, as there is a drought and all the villagers were starving.\nI give them each a piece of meat and one sends me to the village leader, who has a sick horse.\nShe sends me to kill ostriches in the Savannah to gut them for the mint roots they eat to create a cure.\nShe doesn't ask for their meat for her starving village, just the roots.\nHeading out into said savannah, I find green grasses and trees with numerous Ostrich, Warthogs, Baboons, Cheetahs, Rhinos... A short walk out I find white sand beaches with crystal blue waters teeming with fish... all manner of tasty things to eat out there but these slack-jaws are starving for some reason.\nBut they don't want you to hunt for them, they want you to cure the sick horse so you can ride it past all the delicious creatures of the field to beg for food from the next village over.\nAfter curing the horse, I rode off for the next village of the mind that the people of Bayan didn't even deserve continued existence if they could neither grow crops nor hunt nor fish in the midst of such abundance.\n\nMy grand quest was later cut short when I was sent to the Orc mage and a bug kept him from responding to my attempts to speak with him.\nJust how bugged other quest NPC's may be further in, I do not know but frankly I was not drawn in enough to risk investing my time beyond the first bugged subject to find out.\nOverall, I would say even if I had not encountered the bugged NPC, I simply found this game lacking.\nIt is unfortunate, as it feels as though it may have been on the right track at some point and somehow fell short of hitting the mark somewhere along the way.\n\nIf you do choose to get it, make sure it is during a super cheap sale for 85% off, because it is certainly not worth the $19.99 standard price if you are risking game/quest/npc breaking bugs.","January 14","false","16.1"," 44 of 73 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","44","73","9","0"

I actually believe that I would still be happy if I payed the full 20 dollars for Two worlds 2.\n\nSo let's hear the primary complains\n\nDRM\nUncheck the box, type in the code once. Done. No problem, no hassle\n\nVoice acting\nThe one thing I really love about this game is that every voice actor is different (or almost all). It's like I'm really in a living breathing world as everyone sounds unique. In the real world, not everyone is a great orator either. Some people are shy, some people mumble, some people are annoying, some people are goofy, some are awkward, some are confident. This game captures all of this aspect.\nUnlike skyrim and oblivion where every NPC has a golden radio voice, with imperfection lies a certain charm that can't be seen in other games.\n\nStory\nI didn't finish the story yet, but it's not bad. Open world games aren't really known for great stories anyways.\n\nSide quests\nEvery side quest is unique, and there is an abundance of it. They do go in depth and there are species areas allocated just for the quests instead of plain backtracking.\n\nCombat\nOkay, there is actually a problem here. The swordfighting is clunky. You have to not press any directional button to initiate combos and sometimes the hitboxes are way off. That is a genuine flaw.\nArchery is wack. It doesn't feel satisfying and the hits of the arrow seem shallow.\n\nHowever, the magic spell crafting portion of the game is amazing. 4000 combinations of spells and great varying effects of each unique permutations make magic combat great. The others not so much\n\nThere you have it. If you see it on a sale I would definitely recommend a try since it dips below $5 (and often 3$)","April 21","true","13.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I say make because the whole magic system is really detailed (if hard to get) card  system. You will at first think why the hell am I traped with a lousy fire spell even though im a level 10. Then when you sstart to get cards you start thinking ok I have a ton of cards but I dont know how to make anything usefull.

I would get into all the cool mechanics, the odd sense of humor, the vast amount of content, the crafting system, and the frankly insane magic system. But to be honest, I'm really just here to get something off my chest.\n\nFor all of the game's vast scale, beautiful landscapes, absolute freedom, and good mechanics, I'm afraid despite all the time I sunk into it it never really stuck with me. The world never felt alive or like anything I was doing had impact on anything else. In short it constantly felt like I was in a game interacting with npc's, a horrific sense of disconnect that kept me from caring about anything that happened in it. It has almost a lonely feeling to it. In that sense I think it shares a ton with games like Sacred 2, where it feels like quality was sacrificed for quantity. Though, this game is WAYYYY better than Sacred 2 XD (Talk about a waste of time!) This lifeless world was really the Achilles heel that kept a good game from being a great one!\n\nMorrowind has its incredible world that draws you in with a unique setting and music, Skyrim has some damn fine side questing and full voice acting, not to mention some incredible lore to get sucked into, and TW2.... well, doesn't really have any of that. :/\n\nThat is not to say that it's a bad game, as I said, mechanically it's a solid RPG. But if you're looking for immersion or a living breathing world, you would probably be better off buying something else. I really want to love this game because I like lesser known studios being successful, but honestly I found my time in the world only moderately entertaining.\n\nIn the end, I think my sentiments mirror Angry Joe's, if you're a HUGE RPG fan who is waiting for the next big RPG and haven't checked out TW2, you should! It does a lot of things very uniquely and has its own personal style which is worth experiencing. Unique mechanics and a quirky, slightly self aware humor are just enough to keep you soldiering on. Just don't expect to feel very engaged, maybe listen to a podcast or chat over discord while you play. XD\n\n7/10 - Unique, a definite recommendation RPG fans burnt out on Skyrim/Witcher. Flawed, has a hard time making its setting engaging. Get it when it goes on sale.\n\nEDIT: One thing I forgot to mention, and why I went back to review this game in the first place, is that shockingly an update is coming out for the game soon. It makes absolutely no sense, but there was an announcement of a sequel and another upcoming DLC to coincide with an engine overhaul. I think it's pretty amazing they're still updating this game! Kudos to the developers for being so dedicated, it certainly has me very curious at to what the DLC could be! So if you do buy the game, bear in mind that apparently there will be an overhaul in quarter 2 of 2016... which is really close.","May 21","true","4.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

Another time while doing a task in the swamp ran into some creatures that were part of a task which I did not have yet, then when I did, I could not do them because I had alread killed them and the tasks did not reset itself or would still be showing on my map .  Also, one thing about the free roaming aspect is, if you wander off too far from where the game thinks you should be it will send you back, even if you found a way to get their using your aquired abilites.

As a fan of Garry's Mod, Skyrim's WORLD (not the combat) and free-wheeling, massive games like Wind Waker or Mass Effect, I thought this might be up my alley. I'm not "terribly" pretentious when it comes to graphics, and I like European games. I thought "Hell, why not." Bought it at full price. With the DLC.\n\nI had no idea what I was in for.\n\nJoe, I love you man, but your tastes and mine are not the same.\n\nBut first, the good. The World: You can pick a direction or a distant mountain or tower, and walk there. I love that in any game. But there appears to be three huge continents on the map: THIS IS A LIE. There is ONE continent, ONE small island, and ONE SWAMP. THE THIRD CONTINENT IS A LIE. Also, if you like generic Asian land, Savanah Land, and Swamp Land, then this game is totally for you.\nThe graphics: The environmental graphics, while often repetitive, can almost be breath-taking at times. At full graphics I'm sure it's quite nice looking, especially the ambient lighting and textures. I particularly like the undead swamp, abandoned Asian town, wasteland, and initial savannah area.\nThat being said, the character models are quite atrocious. While they weren't exactly repulsive, they were very, very ugly, in a charming sort of way, and suffered from an armor designer with tastes very similar to the horrifically awful taste in the Dragon Age games. Seriously, Bioware, shoot that desginer.\nAnyway, another somewhat bright spot in the awfulness is the spell design system. I love anything which allows you to summon creatures, and worked like hell to get where I could summon a massive army of skeletons to do my evil bidding, wiping out whole villages of hyena-men in a massive melee beneath a piercing bright moon on the blood-soaked savana. That totally kicked ♥♥♥, as well as wiping out outposts with hordes of rock golems, or my undead horde murdering fishmen in some idiot's flooded basement.\nThere were some quite memorable side missions, the most well-done the very early on "Fluffy the Dog" mission. That was a quite excellently executed buildup and execution of a damn creepy horror level. Playing at 3am with headphones to hear that soundtrack in the final room (you'll know it) was truly nightmare fuel. Also that bit where the the guy was being buried alive, and the undead swamp, had really quite nice, stark imagery and fairly well realized concepts. I really quite liked those parts, when it was being marred by...\n\nThe bad: And how much bad there is.\nFirst the writing: It is quite, quite awful. The side characters (and there are too many of them) are, for the vast majority, flat, lifeless constructs who dole out missions. I can remember a few of them mostly a corrupt embalmer, the grave digging guy, and the creepy priest. And some of the more major characters, the gay captain, the witch, the demon priest, the one British guy (?), the orc chick (Bioware relationship it most certainly was NOT) and of course the Big Bad himself. I actually was genuinely interested in his backstory, and to see how he and the main character were really very similar: both ruthless sons-a-♥♥♥♥♥es, who just happened to go down different paths. Definitely not a novel concept, or particularly well executed but I liked it anyway.\nFurther comparing it to Bioware and Skyrim, I appreciate that everything was fully animated and voice acted. Not many games has the cajones to do that.\nHowever, that being said, the extremely annoying protagonist caused me to remember why silent protagonists aren't so bad after all: he never shuts his god-damn mouth. He dispenses a tiny pool of one liners upon dispatching his feeble enemies which RAPIDLY grate on the nerves during extended play sessions.\nThat, and all the voice acting there is is EXCESSIVELY awful voice acting. Seriously. It is very very bad. But, in a morbidly enjoyable sort of way, I guess. You can always skip it if it really starts to ♥♥♥♥ you off (which it may).\nThe other truly terrible bit of the story is the cutscenes: Every one of them is overly elaborate, horribley mo-capped, butchering-the-art-of-cinema awful. Seriously. These guys need to learn about a little thing called subtlty.\nAnd speaking of subtlty, the ending twist may just be the worst thing ever. Yeah, both of them. They just plain suck.\n\nNow to break down the meat of the game:\nThere is only one good class. Forget about the complicated spell casting system, because this is how EVERY, and I mean EVERY battle works. Summon deads. Deads distract enemy/form human wall. Throw the same basic spell 500000 times because it is the only thing that recharges fast enough until the deads vanish. Resummon. Repeat until target dead. Repeat ad nauseum with every single fight, and by that I mean the 1000s of enemies you will face in the course of this game. Utter lack of damage resistance means attacks from tough enemies often kill you instantly.\nArchery is broken and horrible so rangers are stupid and don't exist.\nHorse combat is utterly non-existant. I get that we can't all be Mount and Blade, but horses are worse that useless.\nOnly fighters have enough damage resistance to be worth playing, but their fighting is possibly even more boring. Spam attacks, wait for idiotic MMO cooldowns, and slavage armor so thick that enemy attacks don't even graze you.\nPvE is totally unbalanced. If an enemy succeeds in wounding you, pause time, make 5000 health potions, then drink them.\nThe stats system utterly lacks subtelty. Put all your points in health and strength. There is absolutely no point to multi-classing. Dark Souls this AIN'T.\nHorrible boring enemies that make JRPG's slimes and bats look clever. Ooh, my club and I are SO scared of skeletons.\nI truly hate when ostriches, hyenas, boars, and rhinos, all of whom should hate each other, gang up to kill you. It's lazy.\nAnd you may have heard of the final boss battle on a forum. It is one of the most truly pahtetic, disgusting and spectacular fails of a fight I have ever seen in gaming history. I don't mean that lightly.\n\nAll in all, it's frustrating, it's idiotic, it's droll, and it's very boring at times. But there are many points where I had fun.\n\nSo I'm sorry, Two Worlds 2. I simply can't recommend you to the world. I can only say to those would be buyers out there: if summoning a horde of skeletons to kill a herd of rhinos sounds awesome, or an extremely clumsy approach to sexual assualt (shudder) is your cup of tea, or you LOOOOOVE horrible MMO combat: By all means. Play this... thing. It's your funeral.","December 10, 2014","false","12.1"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","14","22","4","0"

Voice overs are a bit lame and you have to pay attention to them to gain insight on what to do next. The game at times doesn't give you the ability to see it in "notes/journal" or go back and have the dialog repeated again. Caught me a couple of times where i had to go find a Walkthrough for the game on-line to get a clue. A couple of annoying glithces, but for the little money I spent on it it's been worth it so far.\n\nUpdate:\nNow that I progressed to the ridiculous boss scene with the dragon possessed queen I have to take back my recommendation. The boss scene is rigged against you. For just about every third strike you have to guzzle a health vial and the control responses change from what you have grown very accustomed to so as to further aggravate the frustration (heavily lagged response to control commands).

So many good ideas, so much effort, this game has HUGE potential to be something great. But no, for every good thing this game has going for it, there's equally big hunk of cheesy execution or strange desing choise to scale that down.\n\nAfter around 150 hours of playtime in Xbox version, I wanted to see if there's any difference in PC version. Though PC version is indeed superior, console version and PC version shares same strange desing of "Press 2 specific keys to do everything ever". For example; Mouse 2 is your sneak, sprint, defence, map- and enemy marking, and space acts as jump, use, loot, speak, interact, start event (lockpicking, playing an instrument) and backstep/dodge. Some of these doesn't work well together at all. When you try to raise defence in combat, make sure you're in complete stand still, or you'll end up running all around the place like Usain Bolt with his ♥♥♥ lit on fire.\n\nHowever, Two Worlds 2 is not bad game. Not at all. If you get through the confusing intro and get used to its controls, you're in for time consuming adventure loot-a-thon in a rather beaytiful, well made world. Yet still this is a far from actually good game. Like I early stated, for every potentially good thing this game has, there's somekind of bad decision in desing or execution.\n\nI see the reviews of Two Worlds 2 are rather neutral, whitch suits this game extremely well. My overall opinion of TW2 is "Neutral". It's not bad or good game, it's "neutral". You won't lose anything trying this game out, nor there is any special reason to play it; it's "neutral" experience.\n\nThe prize might be this games' biggest minus side. TW2 can offer you hours upon hours of exploring, but it reguires so much getting used to, that 20 euros for this might be just a little too much. Shall you get it for near 10 euros, do consider trying it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drhuh/recommended/7520/","drhuh","Dies-A-Lot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drhuh/","147 products in account","Well, after Two Worlds 1 my hopes were up. I should have known better.\n(note: updated 02-Jun-2016 after spending far too many hours playing it to the end)\n\nTwo Worlds 2 on PC is worse in every way.  I'm barely to level 6 and I'm already annoyed as hell with this game.  When I got to level 40 or so, I was truly p i s s e d off at this game. Sheer bloody-mindedness kept me going, except for the ending. More on that later.\n\nOn the plus side, the game lets you keep playing after the ending. I like that in a game.\n\nIf you think that reviews should only be sweetness and light, stop reading here. It gets ugly.\n\nTo start with, the graphics. Even on max resolution, it has the feel of a game stuck on 640x800. Limited view, huge character in the middle of the screen, everything that's wrong with a low-resolution view but at 2560x1440. Even fiddling with the FOV doesn't really help.\n\nThen there's the inventory tracking. TW1 let you put things where you wanted them. TW2 doesn't even pretend to care. No matter resolution (see above), the inventory screen takes up most of your screen. And instead of fitting more onto the screen, they just increased the size of the items. So you end up multiple pages of stuff you cannot sort to suit yourself, that you have to page through to find what it was they just plopped into the inventory.\n\nCrafting? Don't make me laugh. You can "upgrade" equipment, except you can't upgrade it very much to start, and by the time you have the level required to upgrade it to something nice, you find stuff that's better than what you can upgrade it to anyway. Then there's the material requirements. Each item drops 1, sometimes 2 of a material. However, to upgrade the full 20 levels, you'll need hundreds of material items. Which you cannot buy in bulk, you have to laboriously dismantle equipment, one at a time. And you'll never find enough of certain materials, and you can't afford to buy them, because by the time you have enough money, you can't find the low-level stuff to buy any more, even though it yields exactly the same "1 material" as the much more expensive stuff. Useless.\n\nAlchemy? Not bad, but really not useful. That is, even if you can find the ingredients in your pack once you have them. Sadly, there doesn't seem to be any order or reason to how they throw it into the pack. So you spend most of your time mousing over to see what it was you wanted to put together. Even then, alchemy really isn't that useful in the game.\n\nFight mechanics are a wash. Initially you can't do anything, and you'll end up dying a lot.  At least TW1 gave you an option of dodging a lot when facing tough opponents. TW2 - nope, 1 or 2-shot kills is the order the day if you get close to the wrong opponent. Save. Save often. Because you'll be needing it. It's as if they looked at Dark Souls and went "hey, that's a great mechanic" without putting any thought into what makes it a great mechanic.  Later in the game you can at least block a good portion of damage. And if you time it you can sprint out of the way of a blow by the larger creatures. The fighting system still sucks though.\n\nThen there's the horses. In TW1 they were bad enough, with really poor controls and generally almost not worth it. At least you could ride and look around a little to check out landmarks, etc, so they were mildly useful. In TW2 they decided that "useful" wasn't something they wanted, so they took it a step further and made it so you have to constantly pay attention to a particular meter so you keep clicking at the right intervals to keep the horse moving. No clicky, no move. But if you click too much the horse throws you off. They effectively turned it into its own very boring, very long, and very annoying minigame. As for controls, it's almost unmanageable. A single keypress left or right at low speed and the horse does a 180. "Fine control" doesn't seem to be in the vocabulary.  As others have said, just up your stamina and sprint everywhere. Probably faster anyway.\n\nThen we get to the final boss fight. You've spent the entire game honing skills, creating armour, collecting potions - ALL OF WHICH will be completely and utterly useless in the final boss fight. They turned it into a duck-hunt game where the duck gets to shoot back. Really. Except the duck is a dragon, but that's the only difference. Your fire resistance? Doesn't work. 100% fire resistance? Doesn't count, you take exactly the same amount of damage as if you didn't have any. That in addition to clunkly controls (on the PC) make the final boss fight one of the most aggravating examples of shoddy work I've every seen, INCLUDING the boss fights in the pre-fix version of Deus Ex Human Revolution.\n\nOne of the most disappointing sequels I've seen in years. Avoid this game at all costs!","May 25","false","53.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Set in the Medievil times around 1400-1600. The Singleplayer i have yet to try even though i have played around 24 hours on it so far. The Mutiplayer is very entartaining, with 8 Mission + 4 DLC Missions. There is a lot of different classes and races you can play, such as A Elf Warrior, A Dwarf Fire Mage, A Human Necromancer, Dark Elf Ranger, Orc Two Handed Weapon Warrior... And your characters customtion is good with a lot of different styles. There are 5 Different Gamemode with 1 DLC gamemode, the gamemodes are good, with Adventure ( The Missions), Duel ( PVP) Crystal Capture, Team Deathmatch and the DLC Gamemode is Defence. You have a leveling system in the game, I'm Currently Level 42 on my main account and 36 on my second. There is also a village mode on mutiplayer, you pay 10,000 Auras ( Game Money) to build a village then you can build Ranchs, Farms, Windmills, Taverns...etc. But you get money from this village like when you build a shop you get profit, but if you build something that requires a upkeep, then you lose profit, you get your profit ( Lets say i have 1000 Profit) every 6 mins ( in real time). Sometimes your village moral go's down causing you to lose profit, but you can kill the creatures, which increases your villages moral. This Game is really loads of fun and me and my friends spend a lot of time on it, either Leveling up ourself's or speed leveling are friends ( you will understand Speed leveling once you play this game). This game is worth Spending money on, maybe not the DLC as it is not worth the asking price, so i'm lucky i got the game and DLC off Tremor.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terry309/recommended/7520/","terry309","terry309","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terry309/","60 products in account","The first Two Worlds is arguably an abomination, surely it had a decent sized open world, a huge range of equipment and online to boot, it was executed badly and i really mean badly, it's one of the glitchiest rpg's...no, games of this generation.\n\nPeople were horrified to hear that there was a sequel to this foul game, so much that they thought it was laughable that it even got a sequel in the first place as well as the running joke of "two worlds two" but in fact, a sequel was just what this game needed.\n\nAlthough it was supposed to be an expansion to the first two worlds, reality pump and topware clearly saw that the first game wasn't well received and decided to improve upon it rather than adding on to it. As a result they decided to make a sequal...though it does seem to be a remaster of the original two worlds with the main villian of the first game returning in which you clearly beat him (ganondorf much?), that is if you picked the good choice. It's easy to say that this game is a lot more engaging than the first and you can see that they really worked hard on this game. The graphics for starters are pretty good, something you wouldn't expect to see after the abomination that was the first game, you can clearly see an improvement. Unfortunately this can make the game pretty unstable at times with plenty of lag issues (especially if you're playing a mage character).\n\nThe game opens up in Castle Vahkmaar where you have been taken prisoner by the evil emperor, Gandohar (what a step up eh?) and you have to escape the prison where you end up on this small island and meet a prophet as well as a band of orcs, afterwards you are free to explore the open world...well not exactly everywhere. You unlock new areas as you progress through the main quest which may be off putting to some. One of the games strong points is it's questing. Unlike most wrpg's Questing doesn't always feel like a tedious affair, sure there aren't as many quests as most wrpg's such as elder scrolls but there are a lot less "filler" quests, most of the mundane ones being buliten board quests. Quests in Two Worlds 2 feel more interactive than most, though the main game gives you very little options in choice, there are often multiple paths/choices that you can take in side missions and many of them are engaging if only for the bizarre sense of humor in them and their creativity. Some quests may seem plain and simple at first however there are many twists and turns which may take you for surprise or they're just plain funny. Some quests can be pretty mundane but there aren't that many of them, thank god (seriously if you're going to add side quests at least make them interesting).\n\nThe main story itself is pretty standard fare for most wrpg's, don't expect anything amazing. Two Worlds 2 can catch some players off guard though as it's storyline does have a few twists and they are well explained. put simply, do not play this game for it's plot. The main story does have some interesting moments and scenes however, just don't think about the plot much and enjoy your time in antaloor, pay the story no attention.\n\nThe game play has improved from the first game and is similar to that of Diablo 3 but far superior (expect something Diablo esque with the game play) every element of game play feels reminiscent to Diablo, heck i even made some spells from the original Diablo in two worlds 2 such as immolation and nova as well as mana shield. Expect a lot of potion drinking and keep well stocked. Unlike Diablo however, this game is more open world style and isn't top down, so if you want a more modernized rpg with a Diablo like combat system, you've found it (heck even the health orb is reminiscent to Diablo). There are three different classes, melee archery and magic (Diablo much) and you are able to become a hybrid of these three classes should you choose to. Each class has their own set of skills available which you can learn in any order you please but before you can begin leveling up your character's skills you need to buy skill books to learn the skills initially (formerly learned from trainers in the first game) in order to use them and to level them up.\n\nMelee learn skills which can assist them in staggering the opponent and breaking guards, they can also deal extra damage, one move in particular allows you to deal considerable damage to an enemy but is only useful against an enemy who is left open to attack as is is easily blocked and hard to connect with. Using these skills also allows you to interrupt enemy attacks so you should use them wisely\n\nRanged learn skills which can alter their elemental attributes and affect the speed and damage, most ranged skills are passive. There is a sniper mode however it is badly implemented which makes it useful only to pick off foes who haven't noticed you yet which is useless in many of the games dungeons due to their lack of space.\n\nThere is also a "sneak" class however sneaking isn't effective enough to be considered a class of it's own, sneaking doesn't seem to work well in this game and it is simply easier to not bother with it.\n\nMages are arguably the most diverse class as Two Worlds 2 allows the player to customize their own spells to create new ones using spell cards which give mages devastating effects. This is one of the games strong points as it allows you to experiment and be creative which is always good. the only problem is that their strength is limited, very much like in Diablo, unlike melee classes which become stronger and deal more damage with strength, mages do not get stronger with willpower as it merely gives you more mana and grants access to higher level mage skills, this is rather disappointing and in the later half of the game you will usually end up using ricochet spells simply because they are the best spells available and deal the most damage just so the mage can keep up with the other classes.\n\nThe melee class is arguably the strongest in terms of base damage but they are required to use potions often, however the mage is a lot more versatile and can take out enemies at a greater range and it's spells can hit multiple targets making it somewhat more deadlier than melee. Ranged isn't really much different from melee other than it is long range. On paper ranged are the best choice of class but they most certainly aren't as they lack the complexity of that of mages and they don't have enough skills to balance with the other classes, unless you are best on being a ranged character i would strongly recommend against it as you will find the other two classes far more interesting.\n\nIn terms of inventory and equipment, Two Worlds 2 feels a lot less diverse than the original which is disappointing, you will likely be stuck with the same armor you start with for a very long time and will be unable to upgrade until later. However the inventory system has made several improvements, items are a lot more clearer now on the screen and it is easier to organize, one of the few gripes i have about it though is that when you equip an item, it just shows a highlight marker so if you're not careful, you could accidentally sell it to a merchant. There is a new crafting system to replace the combine system from the first game making it far more balanced and you are able to dismantle items and save their parts for later to upgrade other equipment. There are also gems which you can socket into your gear to give them added effects, you can also combine them to make higher level gems using the fusion skill. You can also colour your own equipment using pigments to give your equipment the colour you desire, though not every equipment can be colored.\n\nDue to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character limit, i'll have to cut the review from here\n\nRead full review here: http://www.destructoid.com/blogs/Terry+309/underrated-two-worlds-2-review-268357.phtml","August 5, 2014","true","17.6"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","24","42","0","0"

I'm letting you all know, 3 days before the end of the sale.\nThe story is decent, the voice acting works, it gets a bad rep for being a little different. Also, the AI is hilarious. Sometimes enemies brutally murder you, other times they are completely helpless. It's random and fun.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic, the combat system is unique, often difficult to master, but very rewarding. There are no "classes". You just level up and choose where to put your points. You can spec in one type of combat, and you should, but that being said, mages can assasinate using stealth attacks and warriors can summon demons to fight with them. Rangers can snipe and shoot multiple arrows at the same time (and actually aim them at different targets), and the lockpicking system rocks. Mages MAKE THEIR OWN ♥♥♥♥ING SPELLS. Oh and the alchemy rivals that of the witcher and TES.\n\nIt's open world, multiplayer (in an entirely different RTS game mode which is sweet), the graphics are gorgeous, the combat system shines, the loot system rocks, you can use a demon eye to float around and scout ahead of you.\n\nDid I mention you can be an actual Bard?? As in, you buy an instrument, and then sheet music, and you get to actually play it. Each instrument has a different style, which you play in a guitar hero like fashion. You can play the drums, the harp, the violin, the flute, and the guitar. The drums are the easiest, and the guitar is the hardest. If you play in crowds, you will actually gain money from the people, depending on your score. Being a bard is so awesome I've literally paused my questing and done nothing else but play, just to try and master it since the moment I discovered it.\n\nSeriously, you are going to want to give this B-sider a shot.\nJust beware, it's really hard.

It's been set in a beautiful world however filled with different types of enemies and some side quests to keep you entertained should you decide to do them. I enjoy watching the clips which are well animated and sword fight early on in the game between an Orc and armour clad Knight was pretty entertaining to watch thanks to the way it was animated.\n\nVOICE ACTING\n\nThe voice acting is good in some places and not so good in others with the main character neither being the best or worst of the lot but in the long run he talks in a grumpy whisper ALL the time with little or no emotion shown in his lines and, truth be told, listening to him speak caused me to turn on subtitles and skip the dialogue.\n\nWhich leads me to my next issue. The Subtitles are poorly written, whether or not this was done in some kind of translation or just by sheer lack of proofreading what is actually said is sometimes a little different to whats written. This wouldn't be a problem if not for the grammer and placement issues I noticed so even though the actors make perfect sense the subtitles sometimes don't.\n\nGAME WORLD\n\nRPG's like this need a strong world to back it up, one that looks good and encourages me to explore and yes it is absolutely beautiful and the enemies in it are often well animated and nice to look at (all except the Groms which annoy me) but I felt no drive to go exploring too far off the road for fear of the extremely tough enemies that randomly plague the wilderness. This game has no leveled zones and, unlike Skyrim on consoles, the world does not level with you. At level 2 you could fight something very capable fo turning you into mince in less than ten seconds so choose your battles wisely. The first town you start in is located in the Sahvanna which is nice and has some enemies often not seen in RPG's like Baboons, Rhinos and other such enemies.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nCombat is easy to pick up. You learn it step by step in the tutorial sections so if you cant block from the get go, worry not because you still need to learn how. Melee comes first then Archery and finally Magic which people (including me) say is a strong point in the game thanks to the customizable spells. Archery and Magic are all auto aim but Melee is a different story, You need to think tactically to some degree though most enemies are a hack and slash affair.\n\nWhat surprised me was the stealth system of the game. You can sneak up behind enemies and stab them in the back with a pretty simplistic animation but this only works on humanoids so far as I know. Though I did notice a fair amount of enemies seem to be have their backs turned in the worst places such as beside a cliff. Why would you be staring into a wall of rock when your back is so exposed to an assisination from behind. It's alnost like they invite you to get that free kill!\n\nSKILLS\n\nSo there's a variety of crafting skills from alchemy to blacksmithing which work but its really hard to explain their function. Lockpicking in this game is quite simple but rewarding and the minigame used to pick the locks is both easy but clever.\n\nMUSIC\n\nThis game has a really good soundtrack. The ambience to the scores during cutscenes are great in my opinion and really bring something good to this beautiful world filled with boring people. You can even buy an intrument and some song sheets though I never got to see if you could play them or not as I wasn't wasting money on it.\n\nAs I play through the game I plan on adding more to my review.","October 14, 2014","true","4.8"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","22","39","2","0"

(Seriously, buy this game, but only when it's 80% off.)\nBut this cannot override how crappy almost everything else in the game is.\n\n1. Let's start with animations:\nMy character's running looks like a japanese schoolgirl running towards senpai (the kneecaps face inwards when running), his attack movements (especially spellcasting) are just off. The horses I guess are okay, but a little clunky in movement.\n\n2. Menus and stuff:\nWhile the developers have tried to add a sense of fantasy into the menues, gold and blue don't go well together, especailly in this game. Their dragon thing surrounding the health bar looks extravagent. They should try a more minimalistic design.\n\n3. Quests:\nWhile the quest system is fine, the objectives and how you get there is often confusing and hard to navigate. Also there's nobody you can ask for clues, or even to repeat the quest dialougue. However, in some situations the quest navagation system is too straightforward, and I literally skipped through half the plot and beat the boss without really knowing the Story while I spent the other half of my time trying to scale mountains and get to the destination before realizing there was a shortcut that can only be opened after completing the quest there. While this might sound intruiging, I assure you it is not after 3 hours of rigorous scaling.\n\n4. Difficulty spikes:\nI don't know if this is just me, but there have been huge difficulty level changes ever since the start. The game expects you to grind, and if you don't, you can't progress. When I was in the swamp navigating my way through undeads, it took me ten minutes to kill 7 of them, and that was using summons and heals all the way through. While about ten minutes before, I was tearing through monsters in the last chapter easily. While this may sound like a personal complaint, I think TW2 should at least offer you a decent difficulty slope from chapter to chapter.\n\n5. FInal boss:\nI spent the entire game building weird magic spells that held so much potential they could be viewed as cheats, and the final boss turns out to be an FPS.\n\n6. Voice acting:\nDon't turn on the sound, just don't\n\nOverall, although I rated it down, this game is worth getting (ONLY ON SALES WHERE THEY ARE 80% OFF)\nThe innovative magic system alone makes this game worth at least a few hours. But fair warning, don't expect much out of the game other than the supercool magic system.","September 23, 2014","false","93.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","1"

This alone has kept me investing my hours in this game. Do-it-yourself spells and every item in the game upgradeable and able to be dismantled into the components needed to upgrade anything makes character building a treat.\n\n--Though the character models and textures look like something from 2003, the post-processing is very good, and the world is vast and full of surprises.\n\n--Between dice, grinding, pickpocketing, vendors that buy and sell at different prices, and a DDR-like musical minigame, there's plenty of ways to make money.\n\n--horses, boats, and fast travel - you can get to where you need to go quickly. It's almost too easy...\n\nCons:\n\n--extra DRM! The Steam release of TW2 did not have the original CD DRM stripped, and the activation server is almost constantly down or unreachable. You will have to call a German number and manually activate it, or find the developer forum and email the head developer to have him manually activate it. This game came out in 2011, not 2001 - this is outright unacceptable, and if not for Steam's no-refunds policy, I would be screaming for a refund. (Glares menacingly at Ubisoft and EA for the same sin)\n\n--Yo Dawg, I heard you like DRM... Used one of the patches before the end of Chapter 1? Uh-oh, you have to re-activate at the end of Chapter 1!\n\n--But not in the GoG.com version. Seriously.\n\n--Bugs. Do not upgrade before Chapter 2, every patch breaks locked doors that require using cheats to unlock in Chapter 1. Some quests get bugged horribly, and some vendors never open up after dawn ever again. Save often, you never know what will screw up. Getting bugged through walls and off cliff edges, items skyrocketing because collision detection went insane, items that don't deposit into inventory correctly...ugh.\n\n--Butt-ugly inventory management system. It really is one of the most innovative ever, but damn is it ugly. can't move anything in stacks, have to click an "are you sure" dialogue, meaning selling 30 of something is 60 clicks, what is equipped on a different build is not highlighted in any one build, so accidently dismantling or selling another build's items happens. And Equipped items are not moved to the top or a special area, they stay scattered in inventory.\n\n--Unbalanced gameplay. Sword and board? You can take out most enemies anyways. Fast hits interrupt attacks, meaning slashing quickly disables an opponent. I've taken out things 20 levels higher than me. There's a mod to fix this, but seeing as the enemies and spells are stupendously unbalanced and grinding to meet an opponent between every quest gets tedious, it feels pointless.\n\n--The magic system is utterly broken. The magic system is innovative beyond belief - and that's its downfall. Random objects like anvils, stones, and barrells can be summoned, thrown around by force spells, and the like. But spells that concentrate stones toward a single enemy can one-shot everything. Meanwhile using missile splitting consumes almost the entire mana pool for a tiny fraction of the damage. Hypnotize doesn't work, altars are titanic and can easily wall off the innumerable small hallways in the game (but luckily don't summon for much longer than a minute). A lot of enemies are strong against or immune to most of the weapons and magic you can garner. Just use a mace and fire, because everything else does little to most enemies in the game, there's only a handful resistant to fire, and they fall quickly to a mace. And on top of all of this, until about halfway through the game, just because the player is commonly in the 5 digit money category, magic is expensive as hell. Invest at least enough in strength to use a good club as a mage, because you sure as hell aren't casting or making more than a few dopey spells until the second continent opens up.\n\n--Censorship. Plenty of swearing and violence, but no blood, no nudity, and even though there's a "sex scene", there isn't one - you just see her butt, she and the lead almost kiss, cut to black, wake up the next morning and never see the character again. Anticlimactic (pun intended). Armors can be recolered, so there's a decal system, but no blood. This feels like something from 2003. With The Witcher coming from Europe, I mistakenly thought a German game would be as no-holds-barred. Nope. Those Germans got it rough.\n\nIf you want this game, and it does have a few things going for it, get it from GoG - that version has the independent DRM stripped out, and works better to boot. We all learn from mistakes; TopWare and Reality Pump have made some beautiful trees in this game into an ugly forest - let's hope they learned from this walking mistake.","December 31, 2013","false","0.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It has so much free roam and the story was great. Every time I play this game I have so much fun. There are some minor problems, but critics tore it apart for these issues. I must say it was very unfair too, as these issues were not game breaking and the critics completely ignored a great game because of them.\n\nCons\n-Everything above the mouth on your characters looks lifeless. In other words, your eyes and nose don't move (but your hair does).\n-The money system is a little messed up. (The best way to make money is by the "Guitar Hero" mini game.)\n-Changed the outcome from the ending of the first game.\n-The voice actor for the hero is a little bit off. (I liked his deeper voice, but I can understand why some may not).\n-The ending is a little frustrating\n\nReally that's about it, yet critics would fixate on one minor issue and act like it was something big. That's why this game has become a hidden gem.\n\nThis game has so much going for it. There are loads of side quests on top of an already decent sized main line. The environment graphics are great! It looks good in all places, especially for 2011. There is lots of free roam and mechanics that you will want to explore.\n\nPro\n-The alchemy system is fantastic\n-The "Guitar Hero" mini game is fun and addictive\n-The story is quite interesting\n-Lots of dungeons to explore (including a set of 10 dungeons that you can't use your map in and the entire thing is completely dark)\n-Great level system once again\n-Awesome magic system that has some real fun depth. (Look at some Youtube videos to see what I mean)\n-The whole game feels so original.\n-ONE OF THE BEST SOUNDTRACKS IN A GAME\n\nThis is such a great game. I have finished it about 8 times on console. Sure there is not Skyrim free roam capability, where you can spend hundreds of hours on a single save, but this game has a solid run through of around 25 hours. If you are a completionist, you can add another 5 or so hours. I could rave on and on about this game.\n\nI hope the developers make another. It doesn't have to continue this story line, but their game is very addictive. I love their games. I wish this game could have kept that Old English charm the first game had, but I understand they probably wanted to appeal to a larger crowd. I absolutely love this game. It was a steal @ $20!

It is an open world RPG in the third person. You face many enemies. One of my favorite (and, a lot of the time the thing I hate most of the game) is how you start getting behind in levels to your enemies. They do not level up with you - they stay the same level. This requires you to either face VERY challenging enemies or do side quests a LOT to keep up. The thing I could say I dislike about the game is the combat system. It's fun at first, but it gets old fast. It is also very glitchy.

You can compare it to Skyrim, the Witcher, etc. but personally I don't think that you can say one game is better or worse than another. Two Worlds II offers features that you may find you prefer more than the variant in a different game, or not.\n\nThe graphics for this game (from my casual gaming point-of-view) are of good quality. They don't seem to be lacking and the textures seem fairly realistic. I've experienced a bit of difficulty with glitches revolving around whatever calculates the physics in this game that resulted in a few crashes here or there, but it doesn't really impact the gameplay too much.\n\nThe combat system is fairly standard, letting you build your character between a warrior, mage, and archer by spending skill points as you level up. There's nothing wrong with the combat - it's standard.\n\nHaving not played Two Worlds I, the storyline was a bit lost on me, but I got the general gist of what was going on and though it wasn't gripping, it wasn't particularly boring either.\n\nThere are a few bugs in this game. For example, you can kick a box... and die (did I mention that?). Once again, the gameplay was hardly impacted.\n\nI could go on and on, but if you want my opinion about Two Worlds II, it's a fairly decent RPG - one I didn't really feel like buying until it went on sale. So if you can snag it for ~50% off or more, I'd highly recommend doing so.","June 11, 2014","true","43.9"," 39 of 76 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","39","76","0","0"

Also, he has those small comments upon interaction which sound smart and help improve his personality.\n+ Super fast loading time.\n+ Ability to save custom outfits in case you need to quickly change from wizard to warrior etc. This should be a genre standard.\n+ Mobile teleport platforms was a very good idea.\n+ User-friendly mission guide that gives you good overview of where you have to go and what you have to do.\n+ Huge variety of enemies throughout the game.\n\nUnfortunately there were those tiny mistakes that could and should have been fixed and improved before the game came out. Those were mainly issues that made the game feel a little immature and green, as if the development team consisted of professionals and amateurs and everyone got to contribute.\n\nCons:\n\n- I never got the idea behind the name ‘two worlds’. Was it supposed to be something metaphorical? I played as a wizard who looked a lot like Gandalf in his younger years and the events were taking place in a savanna/jungle so more than ‘two worlds’ the game felt like Gandalf’s Safari Adventures.\n\n- Major flaw: the game crashed left and right. I could count as much as 5 crashes in 2 minutes. Then again that truly helped me appreciate the quick loading times.\n\n- Character design was way over the top. All those ridiculous, skimpy armors and gosh, those shoulder plates!\n\n- The Voice Acting ...this was such a major one. When you take a person with a normal voice and tell him to imitate a funny sounding person, then it sounds like a normal person is making funny sounds. That happened throughout the game. Voice acting in this game might be the worst I’ve ever experienced.\n\n- The script/ writing. The dialogues were long and dead boring, the story was unnecessarily complicated + there were completely obsolete characters. It all comes down to really bad game script.\n\n- Something that’s easily forgettable once you’re in-game, but how they implemented Digital Rights Management in this game was not acceptable. The kind of information they asked before I could play the game made me feel very reluctant and extremely uncomfortable.\n\n- NPC movement speed compared to animation was out of place.\n\n- The great paradox of Two Worlds 2 is the ability to outrun rhinos and panthers even though your stamina is depleted after 100 meters of sprinting.\n\n- Swift moving around in combat makes the enemy AI go crazy, they will get stuck behind obstacles and go into attack mode some 5-6 meters from you.\n\n- Banal, unrealistic female characters - a demoness, a vixen and a damsel in distress.\n\n- Battles boil down to how fast you can click the mouse button.\n\nVerdict:\nThe Cons list became quite long but let yourself not be discouraged by that, those were just minor flaws, all except the DRM issue which kills the gaming world and violates human rights. Overall it was a very positive experience and introduced many new original elements that I'd like to see become a genre standard.\n","August 20, 2015","true","68.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So if you have anything else to play, you are going to ask yourself why you should play this one. It does not give you a reason early enough. I will out myself that I put in two hours and like 10mins was character creation. The short rating is that the game has stale dialogue, clunky combat, uninteresting characters, and little motivation to push through the tutorial.\n\nCons\n- The dialogue is cheesy... but not in a fun cheesy way but like in an "I am dark and isolated but not really" sort of way\n- The controls were not really made for the PC. The controls are clunky and stupid... just saying\n- The game isn’t optimized well… had random needless unexplained stuttering in empty dungeons.\n- Needless running in empty hallways in between cinemas. Just play the full cinema instead of having me come in and out for no reason. You literally watch a cinema then walk through an empty room and have another cinema… this is not an exaggeration.\n- The character creation seemed extremely limited. Basically 10 different choices in each category (plus sliders). So I suppose if you spend a lot of time you can make a very customized character… but I didn’t see any of the features I look for. For example, facial hair options are basically all the same (i.e. short goatee ish beard). Hair options are basically the same length with slightly different styles… very slightly. No facial paint/tattoos. I know I started with I spent 10 minutes on character creation… but honestly it was less than that.\n- Not sure if this is a fair con or not so I add it only to mention it but the story appears to be heavily dependent on the first game… so a lot is not explained.\n\nPros\n- Sexy Orc woman who finally helps you understand D&D Half-Orcs\n- A craft system exist… so that’s good\n- Variety of combat style (typical though: magic, range, melee).\n- Interesting lock-picking system\n- Magic system based on cards.\n- Not really a pro but another worth mentioned… all the women I encountered so far are scantily dressed women who hold their own… so there is that\n\nI wish I could recommend this game because there seems to be so much potential but that game felt more like a chore than a game… yes first world problems.\n","April 2","false","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

This is a truely wonderful RPG experience.\n\nThe first time I played it which was a few years ago, I was but a meer console baby, and as soon as I played fifteen minutes I dropped the game. What a terrible choice, a few years later I decide to pick it up again and I was blown away how much sheer diversity there is in the playing styles to all the armor and loot choices. The game really does make you feel like an adventuer, from exploring crumbling caverns to a long harsh Savannah Desert to deep forests.\n\nThe combat is a mixed review on my part, I feel as though they could have included a better control system even with a controller. Left trigger is sprint, left trigger is sneak and left trigger is draw. A bit silly due to all the playing styles they really had to fit alot of things in, the combat on the other hand features between an arrowing slinger Archer to a brave Warrior or just a spellslinging Mage. Even though the melee and ranged combat is pretty flawed, it really makes up for it in the spells. The ability to craft different combinations with three different enchantments, from a massive vortex to a chilling icebolt.\n\nOver all, this game has really grown on me as a RPG - I suggest this to anyone who is looking for a good RPG.","July 30, 2014","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I remembered how the game went in the past and things were coming back to me on how to play it. What stopped me from continuing to play was the fact that the game crashed too often. What I mean is that I would be questing, then I wanted to bring up my map to look at my location and instead the game wouuld put me on the desktop. This happened too often and so I tried to deal with it by saving frequently but it got annoying. I would not recommend this game because of this fact. It wasn't just the map function, it happened on other functions like bringing up my skills, etc. Strange, I don't remember this problem when I played the game in the past from the disk.","August 1, 2015","false","11.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/recommended/7520/","TeenJackBauer","👌TeenJackBauer👌","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/","435 products in account","Positive\n+ In terms of graphics, this ends up being a positive mark for the game. While character models and animations leave much to be desired, some of the environments (and the textures themselves) are really well-detailed, including ancient Asian and Egyptian architecture, as well as some impressive lighting that is determined to showcase the best the graphics have to offer\n+ Taking around 10 ½ hours to complete the main story (on Medium difficulty) is a good length in and of itself. But, if you really want to explore everything the game has to offer, you can easily net yourself another 20-30 hours of gametime. There’s no shortage of side-quests to complete\n+ There’s an abundance of different (though basic) gameplay mechanics; from upgrading weapons via blacksmithing, to alchemy, lock picking (surprisingly one of the most fun lock picking minigames I’ve played), and even some stealth mechanics thrown in to offer some variety. And, while the combat is relatively simple, there’s a good variation of skills to use (including ones for melee and ranged weapons, as well as spells) that prevent the combat from being too repetitive or bland, and allows you to tweak your character to fit your preferred playstyle.\n\n\nNegative\n- Easily the biggest negative for me is the lack of difficulty scaling. What this basically means is: if you want to play the game just for the main story, you will have an exceedingly difficult time doing so (even on Medium difficulty). The game will force you to resort to cheap tactics in order to beat boss battles/hard encounters and run past most of the enemies throughout the dungeons, unless you complete side-quests (which there are plenty of, but I don’t think it’s fair to force the player to complete them in order to have a fair chance of defeating the main obstacles the game throws at you). This ends up making the game artificially difficult, as no matter how well you utilise or level your skills, you will have a needlessly problematic trek towards the end credits if you don’t complete optional content (unfortunately the final boss itself is rather awful as well, so I wouldn’t blame you if you felt like quitting before reaching the end)\n- While there are plenty of side-quests to complete, the world itself--which may be big in scale--doesn’t really encourage exploration. There are simply vast masses of land that don’t contain any meaningful sights nor secrets worth discovering, which is a shame because the world itself is quite pretty\n- Again, like the first game, the wooden voice acting and weak sound design in general don’t make much of an attempt to immerse you into the world of Antaloor; though I will admit, the music itself is very charming and partially redeems the sound overall\n- Lastly, the story itself is predictable and forgettable; no interesting main characters and nothing that hasn’t been done before.\n\n\nWorth Mentioning\n• Though people claim the game has severe DRM, all it really is is putting in a serial number, and using online activation to verify your purchase (which only needs to be done once). It literally takes only 30 seconds to do so... unless you forget to uncheck the checkbox which tells you to register (which makes you enter personal details, but this isn’t required to play the game at all). But, if you hate ‘DRM’ in any form (excluding Steam DRM), then by all means don’t bother purchasing the game.\n\n\nVerdict\n“Two Worlds II starts off as a rather clunky experience. But, once you start getting into the swing of things, you will find yourself enjoying the game more and more as you delve deeper into it. While the game is just a basic open-world RPG, with both poor and good qualities mixed together, overall this and the first game have an undeniable charm that makes them memorable (and admittedly better than they deserve to be). With some more polish here and there, this game could be even better than I’m giving it credit for.”\n\n7/10 TJBs","February 4, 2015","true","16.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

It's similar to Skyrim in some segments but it kept it's own spirit and interesting story. With expansion pack you're in it for more than a hundred hours of content. Not to mention amazing graphics considering this was not a project as big or expensive as Skyrim. Music is also very pleasant and it ads to the atmosphere. I want that soundtrack in CD quality.\nSo, all in all, if you can buy this game, buy it. If you like old school RPGs, buy it. If you're not some lazy, spoiled kid, used to have everything pinpointed to you like in today's World of Warcfraft, buy it.","December 10, 2013","true","46.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The tutorial feels too long- after what feels like a step by step guide to how to play, on a basic scale.  I feel tired of the  game already, from learning to running, jumping, how to sneak, attacking, blocking, finally after learning it all over with different weapons. keep in mind, you're learning how to do all this in a span of an hour. Its not entertaining at all, when they could throw in a press LMB to Attack followed & RMB to block.  Rather than there method of doing a full two cutscenes and a one on one battle to learn just that move.  If that's the case make a training room or tutorial button in the menu that ran you through it.  Not try to blend it in with the story.\n\n2nd. The main character- Now this is my biggest problem, it kills the game for me, i can deal with a long tutorial but this will stick with me the whole game.  Its sad to say, but i hate how the main character sounds, like a bad guy in some old time bad film trying to like he is a terribly drawn out hero. making it  hard to follow a story that can not be take serious, its all like some big silly joke, that i did not find funny apparently.  With that said i want to touch on the character creation screen.  you get what, 5 options?  how large of shoulders, chest, and leg length.  what is the point of having a creaton screen when its really how tall you want your guy?  There is no female option since it would bother the story line, you can't change the descent enough hair style.\n\n3rd. The combat- the very little that i player i did encounted some bad guys so to speak, and i had to fight them.  Nothing more to say than the fact i feel as if later through the game, ill be clicking, a lot.  Im sure it will get harder later on but for now im saying the combat is really badly done.  I tend to notice very little use of the movement keys during it since it makes you go crazy and turn your back on the locked on enemy. very big flaw i'd say.\n\n4th. Character animation- At points you can clearly see the mouths not matching the words spoken. Some movements feel as if im watching a kids show.  the movement looks really silly in cutscenes at times.  I could ramble on about a few other flaws but its not drastic enough to mention. So moving on,\n\nlastly what i find actually amusing about the game.\n\n1st.  The scenery- now i am a big fan of dragons, though there is maybe too much dragons placed every where.  I can't say i hate it.  Then once you actually get outside you can see a beautiful landscape, with plenty of vegitation.  Even the intro clip has an clever way of showing it.  No doubt they captured my eye showing the orc, i guess, fleet docking on the shores to charge the castle.  So a plus on that,\n\n2nd. Credit- In the short time of me playing this game i was able to find more bad about it than good.  Other that have many more hours than me could say other wise.  I do give them credit though its not a terrible game. Its not unplayable and im sure it evens out in bad and good later on.  though I may not ever see the ending of this potentionally good game.  Don't let my opinion stop you, im not saying the game is trash, or so bad that it makes me cry.  I rather not be treated like a kid growing up, and get straight into the action.  If you feel the same, i would say wait for a sale.  If you do not agree with me, feel free to go on ahead and purchase this game.  I just hope you get back what you paid for from it.\n\n*Also this is the first review that i actually took time and sat down and really said a lot about a game.  I appologise for anyone that disagrees and feels offended.  As well to those notice the many grammer mistakes, take note that i am writting this at 6:17 am in the morning from staying up all night.  thank you *\n\n\n","January 10, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","2"

Great graphics, great open world, great store, great quests - especially the side quests.  I have been thoroughly amazed by the writing and the dialogue.  The voice acting is stellar, the main character sounds like Christian Bale's Batman.  A healthy amount of coarse language, not overdone - just appropriate.  I guess my only complaint is that like the Gothic series the combat is leveled for the most part meaning once you plateau past a certain level enemies become a joke to deal with.  Sooner rather than later since you level so quickly and gain so many skills and stat boosts there isnt much of a challenge.\n\nI suggest anyone who likes the Gothic/Risen series give this game a try - its a much more polished, entertaining, coherent game that will last with you long after the game is done.","June 29, 2014","true","36.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Massive amount of content which promise hours and hours of gameplay, that is if one is willing to overlook its flaws which make the game a chore to trudge through. Customization is fair although the single player campaign isn't as lenient and exciting as the multiplayer character customization. Combat is clunky at best and weapons dont have any weight to them, although the magic system makes up for it that is if the player is willing to be a mage above all else. There are a variety of enemies to fight against which makes combat refreshing despite the controls and horrid physics. Character models look stiff and unfinished although at times they look great (in cutscenes), maybe its the fact that the arms look really weird and unfinished. Voice acting is bearable most of the time although your character can get annoying at times. Action is pretty much average to say the most, story is decent, Two Worlds II isn't exactly going to be everyone's cup of tea but its a decent game in its own right. 6/10.","June 26, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The voice acting is terrible, the combat is weird at times, and the context sensitive keys seem like a useless relic from console porting, but this game feels like the first Witcher, but without timed button press combat. so far much of what I have been doing is following a tiny main quest thread and running around killing monsters for people.\n\nI'm a total sucker for games with a crafting system, and even though this one is kind of bare bones(only item improvements; no actual item creation) it is still fairly rewarding. Another huge bonus somewhat related to this is that your armor actually changes when you equip new pieces. It isn't just 8 reskinned versions of the same armor ala Dragon Age: Origins. Every set so far feels like a unique and interesting enough looking piece of armor. Cloaks abound, with decent cloth physics, though I have seen one scene where the cloak was draped across a character's body the wrong way, clipping through his chest and draping over his front.\n\nI'm playing this game with the Worldmerge mod, since I have the DLC and it is reportedly more immersive this way. The game looks amazing with DX10. Whenever I launch it with DX9 it just looks fuzzy in comparison. There is a huge amount of realistic plantlife dotting the landscape. It makes grassy fields in skyrim look like child's play.\n\nAfter putting it off for such a long time, I feel absolutely blown away by this game.\n\nEdit: the ending is a little confusing and kind of a let down.

Hearing about the 1st was like reading a good horror novel. Many stories all with terrible outcomes and pretty much a constant census....it was a beyond crappy Elder scrolls copy. Naturally with that mass of "don't do it" you would think it's sequel wouldn't be that much better....apparently that was incorrect. Everyone said this was a light year jump compared to the last. Never played the 1st so I wouldn't know but I can say whole heartedly this is a good game. Even though I couldn't verify my code to start the game for a day or so (until I learned Norton was blocking stuff), even though this game lagged at the very start at the dungeon section (updated drivers? idk just started running smoothly after that even though the drivers were for hardline optimization...) and even though for some reason I couldn't skip the start up intro a few times....even with all those headaches this game has turned out amazing. Magic system was confusing as fudge but it's pretty sweet, pretty large world, dialogue is quite funny, quests don't seem too mundane and not a single gameplay issue really (aside for a few slow downs a few mintues ago and a brief freeze.) Overall I think this is a very good game.\n\nBest way to sum it up would be to compare it to....Saints Row. Two Worlds 2 is the Saints Row to  Skyrims GTA. Pretty sure I didn't world that properly....but what I mean is Two worlds is like Saints Row while Skyrim is GTA. It's not as refined and polished as it's competition and not fully as serious and more cartoony BUT that doesn't mean it doesn't have it's own fun and uniqueness about it.","March 21, 2015","true","30.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can preset five different spells, and switch between them without stopping the action . You need a staff to use magic, but you can also use the staff defensively to hit your opponents . You make your own spells by organizing what looks like Tarot cards into amulets .... The armor looks better, after you spend some money, but the archer's clothing still looks like something Uncle Joe wouls buy at the local sporting goods store .... There's a bit of humor in the game, and plenty of dungeons .... The inventory system can be confusing at first, because of the (quick switch) system that allows you to change between mage, archer, and fighter instantly .... A spell and a puff of smoke for that (quick switch) would make it more believable .... For some reason, the thieves guild gives you the best prices on any gear .... Don't upgrade weapons and armor too much at first, because the stuff you collect as the game progresses is much much better ....The music is highly atmospheric .... Those stiff hand jesticulations that characters make when talking remind me of cheap old kung fu movies Ha Ha .","January 15","true","158.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Second after filling in all this information and getting an email sent to me and buying a serial code, it said that my code was invalid, it said everything I tried was invalid, also everytime I want to launch the game, out of all my games it takes the longest to load and it is one of the smallest, then it makes me watch a stupid intro vid tat you can't skip. Out of all the games the story looks okay, but since I have only been able to play the demo since apparently I am an invalid player/owner of the game. Overall this is the worst game ever, and forcing  someone to fill in their personal details such as their exact location and proxy server should be illegal in which some cases it is, I will never download or play any game from these devs ever again, and I say this for all gamers, stop this miss conduct. The amount of glitches in game, is terrible.\n\nI do not recommend anyone ever plays this, I want a refund!","December 12, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The actual gameplay is fun, but it still has so many problems. I found one game-breaking bug that trapped me in a dungeon, but I was able to get out with console commands. I can no longer stand to hear any of the dialog; the voice acting and script are both so bad.\n\nI also sailed to the largest island in the game, only to find out you can't go to it - if you happen to make it in it teleports you back to the shore. It takes a fair bit of time to get there, so don't waste your time trying. You can only go to the small islands on the map.\n\nAnd because I spent some time exploring around before doing missions I'm an unstoppable death machine with no equal in combat - it's starting to make things a bit boring due to the lack of challenge.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI wish I could even play this game. It took a half hour of searching the internet for a way to get the game to even launch and when it did start working, it wasn't due to anything I did because I hadn't changed anything - merely tried to launch it a few more times and then it spontaneously worked (as far as I can tell). Then, once it was running, it kept crashing every few minutes. On top of all of that, they have the balls to put advertisements in the game to try to sell you other things. It also forced all control to my 360 controller I had plugged in without giving me an option to switch to mouse control, which somehow made registration impossible because I couldn't pick a gender.\n\n"Infuriating" is a rather kind description of my experience with this game so far. I'd like to play it, and I'm going to continue to try for a little while, but after fighting to get it to work at all for this long I simply can't recommend it to anyone.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: Bandicam appears to have been what was causing it to crash. not sure why it wouldn't start up at first. The game is fun, but lips don't match dialog and characters move in cutscenes as if they were marionets. Dialog seems to jump around randomly between subjects sometimes and every now and then it just skips itself mid-sentence as if it expects you were bored.","February 19, 2014","false","37.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It also forced all control to my 360 controller I had plugged in without giving me an option to switch to mouse control, which somehow made registration impossible because I couldn't pick a gender.\n\n"Infuriating" is a rather kind description of my experience with this game so far. I'd like to play it, and I'm going to continue to try for a little while, but after fighting to get it to work at all for this long I simply can't recommend it to anyone.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: Bandicam appears to have been what was causing it to crash. not sure why it wouldn't start up at first. The game is fun, but lips don't match dialog and characters move in cutscenes as if they were marionets. Dialog seems to jump around randomly between subjects sometimes and every now and then it just skips itself mid-sentence as if it expects you were bored.","February 19, 2014","false","37.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I honestly could not get past the tutorial because it would not let me register my product code through their website. Valve also offers no support regarding these issues. The game is actual quite good and is fun to play, but the company that makes it is terrible. I would recommend buying the Witcher I or the Witcher II instead.

Enough about hardware, lets talk gameplay - the story is nonsense, and combat is button mashing and accidents. I generally liked the first Two Worlds game, despite it's many flaws. It seems like these developers were committed to making a sucky game. I can imagine the conversation "Our first game wasn't bad enough - there were still some parts that people enjoyed... So, let's be sure we turn those parts to crap when making our second game!" I've seen other reviews saying the game was rushed and plot holes, etc... This game is bad across the board. For example, ignoring the nonsense story and incredibly jerky gameplay - I can't even figure out how to assign my newly earned skills to one of the 3 Action buttons. I want to replace my fire arrow skill with the newly acquired poison arrow - but there's no indication of how to do this... So, I worked to earn new skills that I apparently can't use.

I generally play with a joystick (instead of mouse/keyboard) and even after adjusting sensitivity it's it doesn't help. I've also adjusted screen resolution and toggled windows mode. Enough about hardware, lets talk gameplay - the story is nonsense, and combat is button mashing and accidents. I generally liked the first Two Worlds game, despite it's many flaws. It seems like these developers were committed to making a sucky game. I can imagine the conversation "Our first game wasn't bad enough - there were still some parts that people enjoyed... So, let's be sure we turn those parts to crap when making our second game!" I've seen other reviews saying the game was rushed and plot holes, etc... This game is bad across the board. For example, ignoring the nonsense story and incredibly jerky gameplay - I can't even figure out how to assign my newly earned skills to one of the 3 Action buttons. I want to replace my fire arrow skill with the newly acquired poison arrow - but there's no indication of how to do this... So, I worked to earn new skills that I apparently can't use. Once more: this game is crap across the board - in evey way.

Sure the game looks alright, and it may even appeal to some but if you want smooth gameplay and a story that does something different while giving the impression that it's a polished work of art, I don't think this is what you're looking for.

They have wizard hats, so... yeah...)\n\nLot of people will think this game is not really good. And yes, it's missing a lot. Animations some times can look... weird... Voice acting... Not the worst, some characters voiced just... Boring. Like with the idea of "lets just finish this". It's not terrible just without much of the emotion, makes its sound flat and boring. Character models can look pretty lame too.\n\nWhat's bad too, is that you can't go to multiplayer continent in singleplayer. And by that I mean, in multiplayer there is different island and it's not that small. And while playing singleplayer when opening map you can see that next huge island and you have this "oohhhhh yeahhhh" but later you notice that you just finished game and didn't even played there, turns out - multiplayer only.\n\nBut the good thing is, theres lots of stuff to do. There's DLC too, that adds new map and stuff. Didn't even started playing that myself (whats bad about it, your character is voiced by different person and it's more annoying than the old one. But when you exploring and collecting stuff he uses lines from the main game "oh, what is this?" and other exploration lines that are voiced by the old voice actor, so it's sounds weird with 2 different voices)\n.......................................................................................................................\n\nIn the end I wanted to talk about DRM. It is bad and annoying, but Im not sure if most people who review and give negative rating with "Key doesn't work" are stu... Lets just call them... Special... Or what.\n\nI reinstalled game lot's of times, re-entered key every time I reisntalled game, just did that today too. Everything works well every time, never had single problem with activation. Key works EVERY TIME. Im not sure what people are doing to mess everything up. JUST REGISTER YOUR KEY TO YOUR EMAIL, IF YOU ENTERING KEY FOR THE FIRST TIME. AFTER THAT, IN CASE YOU ARE ASKED TO ENTER KEY AGAIN, JUST ENTER KEY AND DON'T USE "REGISTER GAME" CHECK-BOX, SO YOU DON'T GET INVALID KEY MESSAGE.","March 28","true","87.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShinigamiNinja/recommended/7520/","ShinigamiNinja","ShinigamiNinja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShinigamiNinja/","77 products in account","The game is great. I find it rather funny and entertaining, and my only complaint is the framerate.\nI'm gonna be apologetic about some things that others have criticized:\n\nThe voice acting:\nIt's not that bad. Certainly better than the majority of anime dubs out there, and really, it's pretty much on par with the voice acting in Skyrim. Which while no huge feat, is still kind of the industry standard.\n\nThe dialogue:\nIs it perfect? No. But it is pretty dang funny. The charatcers are full of quips and one-liners with a lot of homages (You're a little short for a City Guard aren't you?) and a LOT of self-mockery, especially directed at the previous game in the series, which are subtle, but you'll catch if you play them back to back.\n\nThe fighting:\nIt's pretty straight forward attack-button mashing mostly. But when you do come up against particularly tough opponents you can usually find some way to beat them. Otherwise: go level up. It's an RPG. So of course the mobs that are hard at the beginning (Varns: which are Mummy III army of Anubis style jackal-men) become paper thin foes by 6 hours in.\n\nThe plot:\nSave the girl. Defeat the evil Emperor. Bad guys from the first game are now the good guys. Pretty standard. Is that bad? I don't think so. It's still an enjoyable story. If you're looking a novel, complex plotline, GO READ A BOOK! It's all plot and no grind! Want suggestions? Message me, I'll give you lists. So unless you're looking to be blown away by some unexpected seldom-before-seen tale of intrigue, wizardry, and shenanigans, it's a good story.\n\nAs for the sidequest stories. They're ridiculously over the top, asinine, or just straight up obvious comedic relief. One mercenary mission request is a parent and daughter locked in a cellar because there are angry ostriches trying to kill the daughter by touching her with their feathers and causing an allergic reaction. They sent the letter by carrier pidgeon. Is this serious? Clearly not. To those saying the game's stories are stupid: lighten up. Laugh at the game. Laugh at the genre. They're really picking on RPGs as a genre in this game.\n\nThe mechanics:\nPlays like a hack'n'slash brawler. I like hack'n'slash brawlers. It can be a bit clunky at times, with your character sometimes crouch to sneak instead of running for his life, but you can fix that by changing the key-bindings I believe.\n\nLastly, the Personal Info requirements:\nIt's your name and address. All public information anyway. All information you've already put into Steam likely more than once. Do you really the Polish game designers care that much about you that they're going to stalk you, or ruin their business by stealing your identity? Or send you snailmail? No. It's for commercial data collection. Statistics. By knowing your address, age, and sex, they can precisely gauge who is buying their stuff and adjust marketing accordingly. That's it.","March 29","true","40.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Two Worlds 2 picks up a little bit after where the original left off and you are still just as much in the dark as the first one. Gandohar is doing somethin evil, but his motives are never really explained nor what has happened in between the two games.\n\nOne thing that really bugs me about this game is that a lot of the things in this game have to be worked around and serve no purpose other than to make things needlessly difficult. For example, spell usage in the previous game was a useful way to mix swordplay with elemental attacks and healing to save you from death. In this game spells can only be used with a staff and the system for using spells in convoluted and requires lots of study and experimentation. Spell cards can be bought, but they are ridiculously expensive.\n\nMovement is blockier, akward, and running is hard to control or stop. Horse riding can help you cover long patches of land quickly, but the horse is hard to turn and jump with, and you can easily lose track of him while on foot.\n\nFinally, the overlay system of the last game (which let you combine two of the same weapons or armor pieces to make an improved version) is replaced with a crafting system where gear is improved with materials found by breaking down other gear. While not worse than the old system, it's still another unessecary thing to worry about.\n\nOverall, I would reccomend you play the first game before you play this one otherwise you may be unhappy with the systems and mechanics and not give it a try.","January 25","true","142.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

At times I did not know what to do or where to go.  Goof around a little and it will come to you.\n\nThis game needs modders in a bad way. Modders fix what devs just don't get and that is needed here in the worst of ways (like Skyrim did.)\n\nI really like the game despite the weakness that is displayed at every possible moment. It just has that feel that I get with the early Elder Scrolls. Perhaps there will be a redux or modders will get involved and make this game great.","April 29","true","5.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You must activate the game by internet or phone with your cd-key, but make sure to uncheck the "register" box so you won't have to deal with the hassle of filling out a form with all your personal info.\n\nI had an issue with this game regarding lag or slowdown where the game would go from running smooth 60fps then lagging heavily then back to smooth. I was able to resolve it by opening Nvidia Control panel and manually setting the profile of this game to run using "Adaptive V-Sync", "Triple Buffering ON" and "Single Display Performance". It still slightly lags in parts of the intro where you escape the prison but overall fixes the major slowdown issues across the game.\n\nAs for the game itself it has its charms and shortcomings. On the positive side the graphics hold up quite well in 2016 with max settings and environments have detailed design. You can have three active sets of gear so switching between fighting styles is easy. Voice over work is a massive improvement over the original game and feels more polished.\n\nOn the bad side of things the game relies heavily on combat and it is very clunky and frustating. For example if you melee and move while you press the attack button for combos, it will break the chain. You must stand still for your attacks to chain. Smaller faster enemies will do hit and run tactics where they will charge attack and immediately run away a few yards, making counters useless. Then there are enemies that will swarm you and attack you repeatedly and all you can really do is block and run away. The game also throws in random enemies that are much stronger then the rest. Problem is you can't really tell which ones they are until they hit you twice while you block and kill you. The animations aren't great either. Attacks look like that don't have any impact and your character looks like he is just flailing his arms around. Auto target is extremely unreliable with a high chance you will be dislodged and attack open space.\n\nI haven't played too far into the game to get a strong grasp of the story but so far the prologue doesn't really offer anything special. The first bunch of characters that help you on your quest seem decent but the main character is annoying. I don't understand why he is so weak that he has to learn how to use a sword/staff/bow and he just talks way too much.\n\nI haven't run into any major glitches (ie. crashing/corrupt saves) but a minor one is during dialog between the characters the lines would get cut off and the next character would begin talking.\n\nOverall it's hard to give a definitive yes or no to recommending the game. I would recommend getting the game absolutely if it's on sale. I picked it up for a couple of bucks. It's a fun distraction if you are patient enough and give it a chance.\n\nHowever, if you had just finished games like Skyrim or the Witcher 2/3, you might feel like this game is nothing but mediocre compared to those polished amazing experiences.","April 6","false","5.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It might not be as good as The Witcher 2 but same game play type. I say if you like Action RPGs pick this game up and if its on sale (like how i got it :P ) its a 100% buy.\n\nJust a fyi there a few glithes and bugs still i seen one Glitch so far but they are easily over looked.So give it a go !!!!","December 29, 2014","true","5.6"," 24 of 49 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","24","49","0","2"

And if that immediately doesn't say something about the game, the combat system was made by a four year old who just really likes to see your character go flying sword waving straight past your enemy. The idea behind needing to aim each individual swing is fun and interesting but in practice just makes it infuriating and difficult in all the wrong ways. 1/10.

This is one of those games where the story cant flow becasue i keep getting stuck and dieding hundreads of times at certain parts. Also you cant delete old saves, so after a while it gets hard to figure out wich one is correct, also the saves appear to have No order to how they are listed, further increasing how much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ this game is. If you try nd go where the game doesent want you to, you encounter OP mobs that can one shot your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ caracter who, even though he has enough money cannot buy Steel armor because your not a high enough level. This game is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and although it could be immersive, there is nothing immersive about dieing 20 times to get through a gate guarded by 6 wolfmen, or pausing it to guzzle health potions, and then running out and dieing anyway...  And although it says its "OPEN WORLD" it might as well not be, casue this game is full of narrow passes you have to go through. making it feel Not open in any way. Also Horses are compleatly useless, they are slower then running on foot. For some reason my caracter can run 60MPH even carrying armor and a big shield.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/recommended/7520/","kony4","kony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/","707 products in account","Two Worlds II gets rid of the best part of Two Worlds - exploration. The original game was a rough RPG, it had many flaws, but it was the exploration that made it a decent game. The sequel is no longer open world, and instead it focuses on storyline, which however, is as bad as in the first game. The NPCs are just as shallow, and the combat remains the same - okay, but nothing special. In consequence, we are left with a game that is average at best, because the excitement of discovering new areas is dimnished by the fact that everything is led by the story, and hence the player cannot go sideways, try to fight much more powerful enemies in hope of much better loot than he is supposed to find. Two Worlds II becomes just an average game with nothing special. I would recommend it only for those who already completed Two Worlds and other good RPGs and have nothing to play. It's okay to kill some time, however, not really worth much. Two Worlds II is a huge disappointment. Instead of improving gameplay in the sequel, developers took away the only thing that made the original game good.","April 25","false","19.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeriatricQuora/recommended/7520/","GeriatricQuora","サイレント死","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GeriatricQuora/","166 products in account","I have mixed feelings about this game. The world is beautiful, and the main quests (and some side quests) involve actual C&C, and allow you to take sides here and there, which adds a lot to the story. There are often surprises to be discovered, when there is more than meets the eye to a quest giver or his motives. However, other than that the game suffers from almost every common problem seen in a fully open world RPG. For one thing, it's a lootfest. You'll be collecting a huge sack of stuff that you'll never need. Inexplicably, that includes a whole lot of buffers for situations you'll never encounter. (I really wish that developers would give some thought to the looting. Make it worthwhile. Give me something really powerful to buy. Give me a situation where I'll need a frost buffer.) Secondly, the story telling is choppy at times. I've finished the game but I wouldn't be able to explain the plot to anyone, just the same way I would be able to explain the plot of a poorly edited B-movie. Not that it's all bad. Sometimes the story can really grab your attention, especially when you're unexpectedly trapped or surprised to find out the identity of the serial killer you were looking for. The people who made this game can tell a good story, but they don't do it consistently. It's almost like the problem was organizational rather than lack of talent. An RPG with C&C is very hard to plan, and this game is a bit rough around the edges as a result. The story could also benefit from real professional writing, and some more complex lore. The lore of 2W2 is very thin and lacks a sense of politics and philosophy. The societies it portrays smack of modern day social norms rather than the humility, grit and fear of the medieval world. It's obvious that the game writers have played The Witcher, because they (loosely) copied some of its stories, but 2W2 lacks the unity of that game and its atmosphere and creative direction. That being said, some of the side quests can be unexpectedly deep and long, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe graphics, as I already said, are beautiful. The vistas are nice. The grass. The water. The shadows. Light shining between the branches. Aside from the nasty screen tearing, it looks better than many more recent RPG titles. Unfortunately, it looks like they were cheap on artistry. The design of everything is cliche. Your mage wears a pointy hat that makes him look like Disney's Merlin.\n\nThe game features three continents and a number of smaller islands. It looks huge, until you find out that the biggest continent is used mostly for multi-player (which I admittedly haven't tried yet). The assets are reused in a subtle way so they don't get boring. For example, there is a university, and then there are ruins of a university in a dark place called the Swallows. They're almost copies of the same thing, but this is difficult to notice. I wish, though, the devs had made exploration a bit more rewarding. There are too many places where there is just a dead end or some nearly useless loot.\n\nThe combat, while fun at times, lacks tactics. I played as a mage, and most of the fights in the game consisted of me casting a summon spell that surrounded the enemies with my summoned decoys that trapped them. Then I zapped these enemies with seeking fire balls. Really, this was a way of exploiting the stupidity of the AI, the fact that the AI cannot push over or walk over another (even much weaker) character and also the fact that the collision detector doesn't detect friendly fire and my fireballs pass right though the summons. In other words, 90% of the fights in the game are ridiculous. The combat system is also prone to the standard run back and forth spamming health potions abuse that is so common in this kind of game. It's made all the easier by the fact that your character can outrun anything. I should also add that the health bars, magic bars and any other bars in the game are about 2-5 times as long as they should be. A typical fight will require 20-50 fireball spells for a single enemy, late in the game.\n\nThe magic system is a bit innovative. You can cast fireball summons, for example. Theoretically, you can combine dozens of spell cards into almost any elaborate spell. In practice, however, only some combinations actually work as a spell. If you play as a mage you'll be firing "guided missiles" for the whole game and not much more.\n\nThe game adds a few interesting touches here and there. Your character talks to himself in some situations, and even makes fun of enemies. You can ride a horse, and even race it. You can buy a boat and visit one of the smaller islands (which just has enemies and loot in it). The alchemy system allows you to use almost anything that you loot in a potion. (Unfortunately, you'll be making mostly potions you never need. (As a mage, I didn't need the stamina boosters, accuracy boosters or even the magic bar booster potions.)\n\nOver all: a notch better than ok, 9/10","November 13, 2015","true","30.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The Story is a bit unrealistic and kinda shallow, Some might even guess how its gona end before geting halfway through the story!\n\nWhen it comes to the Story it's linearly and seems to try cover alot of diffrent cultures (European, Asian and Arabian-African) and most of the time you need to help others with random tedious quest in order to progress. The dialogue in most conversations are boring and uninteresting and even cuts itself off or doesent fit the mouth animation on evry charachter, but the most unsatisfying is the main characters bland voice which more or less kill the mood of evry conversation whit the npc's.\n\nOne thing where Two Worlds II stands out from most rpg's is the skill tree or development, you are not forced to go down one specific route but have the option to mix magic with stealth and/or other abilitys, for example you could become a two handed water mage (might not be the optimal route but it exist) but sadly the strength lies in the mage class where you can create and customise extremly powerful spells which makes the other classes/abilitys inferior to the mage class/abilitys.\none thing alsoe worth noting is that the monster level does not scale well and most of the time the enemys are way to easy or kills you in one hit but the Ai isnt that good which make surviving kinda easy regardless.\nOne thing that realy bothers me is the potential of exploring the game could have had. There are boats you could use to explore the sea but there isnt alot to se in the sea and the boats are not a fast method of travling even the horses arent that great of travling becouse your character has a pretty got pace to his speed and horses can be a bother to find and they cant fast travel with you.\n\nin the end the game is still kinda fun its just sad that it have hidden potential and the story that isn't interesting enough. for an rpg i would give it 5,0/10 becouse there are some elements to it that makes the game somewhat diffrent from other rpg's and works well in the rpg genre!\n","June 4, 2013","true","35.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Она на самом деле лучше, прилизаннее, лишена чудовищных багов. Для многих она подействовала действительно как бальзам на душу. К несчастью, при всем старании разработчиков убрать недостатки предыдущей части новые «элементы» резво бьют по рукам, отбивая желание знакомства с этим безумно неудобным шаблонным миром. Спасти ситуацию мог мультиплеер, однако он заведомо обречен на провал. Сервера пустуют. Мультиплеер первой части являлся настоящим пристанищем лагов и читеров, и, несмотря на все заверения, Two Worlds 2 унаследовала все эти черты. Чего стоит только тот факт, что статы игроков хранятся на локальных компьютерах. Несложно представить последствия этой ситуации. Все, что есть в Two Worlds 2 – прилизанное визуальное оформление и отсутствие багов. Последнее на сегодняшний день – настоящая редкость, так что этот факт может являться стимулом для прохождения игры до конца, в том случае если закрыть глаза на неадекватный интерфейс и пустые диалоги. RealityPump «перестарались» – других слов для подведения итога попросту не найти.","April 15, 2013","true","16.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/7520/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","+ Reworked combat places emphasis on action over animation. Deeper magic system\n+ Good quest variety\n+ Music is still great, voice acting is improved\n+ Lots of minigames that adhere to the experience\n\n~ Armor and weapons can no longer be upgraded endlessly\n~ Alchemy no longer has any negative effects. Once you can make a good channeling potion, you'll forget what dying was like\n~ Texture quality is improved, but everything else looks awkward. There is way too much bloom and motion blur\n~ Horse control is improved, but mounted combat is gone. Enemies can now be run over\n~ Quests now use automatic map markers to show the way. Though it's nice to see where I have to go, I found myself rarely having to actually think to complete quests. It's an imperfect solution that could have been solved through better writing\n\n- Game is short and linear. Main quest must now be done in specific order. 4 chapters, and the last 2 can be done in about an hour each. Game tries to cover this up by having a steep difficulty curve. It makes sidequests feel compulsory, as this is where most xp can be found. Boosting your level this way is the only way to make the main quest a fair challenge\n- Map is much more limited than it looks. Large amounts of land and sea have little of interest and/or are inaccesible. A lot of the time that I've logged on the game has been simply to explore areas that I later found were pointless to explore\n- Stupid AI. Got a bounty for defending myself in a city. Many enemies can be safespotted\n- Lots of glitches. That bounty I just mentioned; I got it for fighting back against a character who was supposed to stop asking me for money after a quest. Quest ended, and whenever I got too close to him, I had to choose whether to pay him or fight him\n\nOverall, it's sort of "meh". Drops the ball on a lot of the stuff that the first game did fine, while introducing mechanics that feel fresh and more user-friendly. Not sure whether I recommend it, unless you also plan on getting the DLC, in which case it's definitely worth a try.","November 10, 2015","true","49.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArrenDusk/recommended/7520/","ArrenDusk","Arren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArrenDusk/","1337 products in account","Two Worlds II is a rather enjoyable experience. While it doesn't certainly have the quality BioWare or Bethesda RPGs tend to have, it has some unique features that make it worth looking into, at least.\n\nOne of these is the combat. The combat in this game is very fluid and diverse. You can choose to play as a warrior, an archer or a mage. There are no preset classes, you gradually become better at your chosen role through leveling up the needed attributes and skills. Sort of like Oblivion in that regard. However you have a set of active combat skills as well, and these vary greatly, from breaking someone's block to countering someone's attack while you're doing the blocking yourself. Even when switching from blunt to slash weapons. Archery is usually done via auto aiming, but the active combat skills that an archer can use will require you to use manual aiming, something which is very welcome. The cream of the crop though, is magic. If you've ever played Magicka, you know how crazy you can get by combining spells to make something truly unique. Two Worlds II? It's the same way. You can customize and build your spells thoroughly, and it never gets old, providing a really rewarding way to play.\n\nHowever, if you're a completionist, and upgrade your equipment well, which is done by destroying unused weapons and armor to gather raw materials to reforge them as upgrades to your current set, (very neat feature) this game will be really easy save for the final battle, thankfully, which is actually challenging.\n\nHaving at least two different forms of combat is important at any given time for the enemies in this game are plenty and each have their own specific weaknesses. While some will die anyway by just button mashing, it'll take a lot longer if you use the wrong weapon.\n\nThe plot is.... to say the least, confusing. The pacing is all over the place and I was disappointed with the abrupt and sudden ending, though you can choose to play after the game ends, thankfully, either to tie loose ends or to experience the pirate expansion. (i've not played it so no opinion on it) You do get to understand it fully by the time you're done, but I do wonder if one would have needed to play the first Two Worlds to know everything.\n\nThe world is quite large and varied with several continents and remote islands with loot ready to explore. You can actually buy a boat and be able to sail it in this game at your own will, something I really got into, except the content for this was sorely lacking. And while I did mention the world is large, which it is, some of it are just smoke and mirrors as 70% of the largest continent isn't even accessible, all you'll get is a "Can't go this way" message and you get teleported out. -_-\n\nThere are horse races and several faction quests, complete with a gladiatorial arena series of battles. This game took a LOT from Oblivion, but it's different enough to not come off as a ripoff.\n\nThe graphics in this game are quite pleasing to the eye, and yes, it has a LOT of options to customize it perfectly should you choose to do so. Nothing but thumbs up from me in this regard.\n\nThe music was okay. Nothing special about it. It did its job but sometimes it could get quite repetitive.\n\nThe voice acting was not that great. No performances came off as fantastic to me, while some other few cases were completely crap. Your main character loved to sound tough, and he NEVER, NEVER shuts up. Whether he finds or kills an enemy, opens a chest and goes swimming, he'll say one of 5 lines every single time. Get ready to hear him repeat them hundreds of times before the game's finished, which by the way is a bit long, though I seriously expected it to be a lot longer given the game world.\n\nIf you've went through all the greats in the RPG genre and need a fix for some more, you could do a lot worse than picking up Two Worlds II. While it certainly doesn't feel like a polished game, it's got its heart in the right place.","April 22, 2013","true","76.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The last part of the game isn't as filled out as the rest of the game, but that seems to be a design issue as much as anything else. As with most RPGs, the real joy of the game is getting there. The magic system is original and flexible (possibly to the point of being overpowered), bow and standard combat is decent but not groundbreaking.  I really enjoyed a lot of the characterization. The horses are a bit of a disappointment, but you really only have to use it for one part. The free expansion is even kinda fun, though I wished it was harder and longer.

Another positive point is the crafting system, you can keep improving stuff you like for a good while until you reach an actual upgrade, and as stated before, friends make it fun.\n\nGrab it when it's cheap, 10 bucks is too much, but 5 dollars seems alright for a fun game with friends.\n\nSingle player hurts to play through, but is tolerable.

I managed to pick it up cheaply as part of a bundle however and decided I had nothing to lose by giving it a go.\n\nTW2 is not a perfect game by any means but it is a vast improvement upon the first one.  The graphics are absolutely stunning, the dialogue is much better (althought still a bit cringey), the storyline is much easier to follow and the mechanics have really been cleaned up.  I would say the game's environments are one of it's stongest suit, something which even the first game did particularly well with.  With sprawling savannahs, treacherous tropical rainforests, gorgeous beaches and insidious marshes TW2 has one of the most diverse maps I've ever seen in a game.\n\nOther Strong Points\n\n- Crafting system (Being able to constantly upgrade your weapon is something I loved about the first game).\n- Range of weaponry (I really do love a game where I can go from a cutlass to a katana to a halberd to a polearm!)\n\nA Few Negatives\n\n- Controls can feel a bit awkward, but still much better than the first game!\n- Dialogue is a bit cringey.\n- Menus are slightly difficult to navigate, especially the quest log.\n\nDon't feel deterred from playing this if you haven't played the original (I played it and I couldn't tell you what the heck it was about) and it is a solid RPG that is definately worth a go.\n\nIn short; not perfect but better than the first one by far.\n7/10","December 29, 2013","true","28.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I actually enjoyed it so far after spending a few hours on it.\n\nSure, it does have a couple drawbacks (but what games don't?).\n\nNamely...\n\n- I feel the character control should have been made a lot tighter & snappier, without that silly sliding stop also. This would have made such a huge diff. It isn't super bad now, but it could have definitely been implemented better. I'd say this is my number one issue with this game.\n\n- The registration nonsense of the game is just a needless PITA (although thankfully it's only a one-time thing).\n\nBut make no mistake about it, the graphics and atmosphere are absolutely spell-binding in this game, with solid character modelling and voice-acting. Story is so-so, passable.\n\nAnd for the low sale price, you won't find anything better out there, that's for sure.\n\nI'd rate this game a solid 7/10 as it stands (would have been higher with snappier character/combat control).","August 3, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However, that doesn't mean this game is particularly good. The main character is still voiced awfully, but as a whole, the voice acting in this game is sooo much better than Two Worlds 1. But, the movement in this game is so unrealistic and loose. Controls are unnecessarily stupid too. To sprint you have to hold down RMB? Dafuq? The whole interface isn't very user friendly (in my opinion) either. I feel like if they got movement and controls better in this game, it would be so much better. But nah.

On console. I've played it for a while on Xbox 360 and saw it on sale yesterday. Thought I should buy it to have some fun again and possibly remake a character, who knows, its >$3.\n\nBut I've spent 2 and a half hours trying to get the d@mn game to activate. Spent a long time researching, even contimplated using one of those shady key generators. After a while, I discovered that they are making a GNU/Linux port for the game next month, which will also fix a few errors. (Now, I'm already using Linux, and emulating the game over WineHQ, so seeing this gives me some hope)\n\nWhat I'm saying is, don't buy the game yet. Wait a while until after next month and look at the reviews... If they get better somewhere, and you don't see any complaints about the abhorant activation process, BUY IT.\n\n(Triple activation is downright annoying and berating to those who actually purchase the game. Some people have to retype in their activation code directly after loading screens... Again, wtf.)\n\nSo as for now, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\n\n(If the problem has been fixed, I'll delete this review and give it a thumbs up.)","May 29","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Combine this with a fairly basic crafting system and you have a decent RPG. I will say this though, there are several bugs that have burrowed their way into this game, whether it is ground polygons having flipped normals causing you to drop into an endless sea, accidentally getting stuck inside of a boulder inside a cave and having to re-load or having enemies getting stuck inside the environment. All and all, 6/10 here.

Like many rpg fans, I played the original Two Worlds, and like many, the game cd for the 360 became a drink coaster, and I have to admit that it is a much better coaster than it was a game.\n\nTwo Worlds 2 is not that.  While it will only show that I have an hour or two played, I previously owned the game for the 360, and liked it enough that I picked it up on sale here on Steam.  If you set your expectations properly, Two Worlds 2 is a great purchase.  Realize that you are not buying Skyrim.  This is not one of the top ten pc RPG's of all time.  At the same time, it is not Two Worlds either.\n\nTwo Worlds 2 is an enjoyable RPG experience, with a fair bit of replay value.

The same button is jump, open, unlock and occationally counter in fights, the same button is run and sneak...

I wish they had done as well with the human graphics, they are not horrible but could have been so much better. The water graphics... WOW the best I have seen in a game!\n\nThe Fighting system...great balance of attack, parry, and defence that makes you think and time your moves for the best outcome. Very enjoyable!\n\nThe Quest system...very in depth with clues along the way and map marks to help get you where you need to go.\n\nThe Transportation...boats...horses...teleports...what else does one need? :)\n\nThe Magic system...fun but complicated. You can create your own spell combinations using 'cards' that you find while exploring, hunting, and buying from merchants. It makes for some fun effects if you have invested in the skill far enough to cast what you have created.\n\nThe Alchemy system...fun to experiment and make your own recipes that you can save and click a scroll to create later with ease. Water walking potion? Squee!\n\nThe Crafting system...on the fly and anywhere crafting! Dismantle what you don't need for components and use them to upgrade the stuff you are going to use! And don't forget the dyes...what color do you want to wear? Find dyes at merchants and use them to our hearts delight!\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game...though it is no Gothic, Dragon Age or Skyrim...it was still fun!\n\nMods...I would recommend the Two Worlds Merged, mod. It expands the World into one large map with no barriers, adds more dye options, an in depth add on series of quests that are quite fun and add hours of gameplay...and many other features that add to the fun!","August 3, 2014","true","240.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It looks better, plays better, and the content while significantly reduced, is of a higher quality level.\n\n7.5/10 for the core game, 7/10 for the expansion which has better writing but a smaller world and a desaturated look that feels a bit washed out and unexiting visually.\n\nIf you want a skyrim extremely-lite experiance, then you might find that here and have a damn good time.","November 9, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wish they had done as well with the human graphics, they are not horrible but could have been so much better. The water graphics... WOW the best I have seen in a game!\n\nThe Fighting system...great balance of attack, parry, and defence that makes you think and time your moves for the best outcome. Very enjoyable!\n\nThe Quest system...very in depth with clues along the way and map marks to help get you where you need to go.\n\nThe Transportation...boats...horses...teleports...what else does one need? :)\n\nThe Magic system...fun but complicated. You can create your own spell combinations using 'cards' that you find while exploring, hunting, and buying from merchants. It makes for some fun effects if you have invested in the skill far enough to cast what you have created.\n\nThe Alchemy system...fun to experiment and make your own recipes that you can save and click a scroll to create later with ease. Water walking potion? Squee!\n\nThe Crafting system...on the fly and anywhere crafting! Dismantle what you don't need for components and use them to upgrade the stuff you are going to use! And don't forget the dyes...what color do you want to wear? Find dyes at merchants and use them to our hearts delight!\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game...though it is no Gothic, Dragon Age or Skyrim...it was still fun!\n\nMods...I would recommend the Two Worlds Merged, mod. It expands the World into one large map with no barriers, adds more dye options, an in depth add on series of quests that are quite fun and add hours of gameplay...and many other features that add to the fun!","August 3, 2014","true","240.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like many rpg fans, I played the original Two Worlds, and like many, the game cd for the 360 became a drink coaster, and I have to admit that it is a much better coaster than it was a game.\n\nTwo Worlds 2 is not that.  While it will only show that I have an hour or two played, I previously owned the game for the 360, and liked it enough that I picked it up on sale here on Steam.  If you set your expectations properly, Two Worlds 2 is a great purchase.  Realize that you are not buying Skyrim.  This is not one of the top ten pc RPG's of all time.  At the same time, it is not Two Worlds either.\n\nTwo Worlds 2 is an enjoyable RPG experience, with a fair bit of replay value.  There are far worse ways to spend your money at Steam, and at a sale price, this game is a steal looking at it from a hours played/dollars spent ratio.","August 8, 2014","true","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While the game doesn't look terribly bad, the animations and combat are abysmal at best.  The voice acting is decent but the conversations involve people going through one of two really low quality animations that just look like everyone is shrugging.  The default key bindings are incredibly odd and while they are rebindable, the way the combat works makes it redundant.  Going into stealth mode requires you to be standing completely still, as does blocking.  If you are moving at all you will instead start sprinting.

It's a huge game. You spend a lot of time in the begining on two main islands. Both feel pretty large. But if you zoom out of the map you'll realise theres a whole other island you haven't even been to yet that's five times as big as the other two islands combined. That's a great feeling.\n\nBut oh my gosh is this game hard to control. You are so clunky! Everything is clunky! The melee combat is just gross to experience, range is either way too easy or way too hard and doesn't feel natural either way, magic is fun to mess around with but is also hard to use in combat especially if you have allies with you. That fire bomb spell doesn't know what the word friendly means. Doors are hard to open, jumping is grotesque, running looks and feels stupid especially if you prefer to carry a staff or polearm. Even the simplest actions like opening chests or picking up loose items is difficult. The loading times for containers is way too long and breaks up the whole game. I can't express enough how clunky this game feels. For a game with so much content, i'm straight up mad the fighting actually makes it unenjoyable to play.\n\nIt's not even like this game is that old. There are no excuses. Especially since the first in the series had the same problem and they failed to fix it. And the fact the game freezes while it loads the next area sometimes is really annoying.\n\nOn a positive note, this instalment improved upon the first Two Worlds in a lot of ways. The world is bigger, there are more kinds of enemies, cooler weapons, better story, necromancy is legal yay! However, it's just as clunky as the first game and really quite hard to play because of it. If the mobility in Two Worlds didn't bother you then you will definitely like this game. If however you're used to rpg's like Skyrim get ready for pure movement hell.\n\n\n","March 13, 2015","false","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is buggy, combat is broken at some points. But the story is great, the voice acting is extremely well done.

Combat is quick and to the point once you get used to it. There is alot of gear and loot in the world, and enemies generally drop decent loot.

Quite the odd name there, just like the rest of the game itself.\n\nUnfortunately, this is one of those games that suffer from the size of their project scope: the final product is extremely hampered, there are many loose ends in the game. It initially gives you the impression that it's a vast world that you can explore and find out all sorts of interesting things, until you figure out that there are many pointless/unfinished locations. Most of the dungeons are copy-pasted a lot (or rather, the whole game itself is), without much effort to make them diversified. This is made worse by the looting system, which makes the content of virtually all chests random. Very few locales/dungeons have chests with unique loot, which is extremely disappointing. Don't expect anything better from monster/boss loot, which is also randomized most of the time.\n\nSome of the quests are interesting in terms of dialogue, but honestly, most of the NPC dialogue is boring, so you'll most likely find yourself skipping it a lot. At some points it takes jabs at common RPG/videogame conventions and tropes, so whoever wrote it has some awareness of the typical RPG designs' quirks. Including their own.\n\nDespite the game's broad variety of courier-boy quests (yes, you, delivery man, go murder some ostriches and fetch me the grass inside their stomatchs), the game's story itself is linear. However, at a certain point in the game, the entire game becomes much more restricted: suddenly you can't teleport anymore, and you're restricted to this small area and do a handful of quests because the devs cannot allow you to leave this fenced space. Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥? That was a huge kick in the balls. At this point it becomes very obvious that they couldn't finish the rest of the game for whatever reason.\n\nI'm only talking the negatives here because other reviews have highlighted the brighter side of the game: I particularly liked magic a lot, and that's what kept me playing the game. Still, I wouldn't recommend it unless you were really bored and had nothing else to play in your semi open-world RPG list (think Elder Scrolls, Witcher, some of Bioware's stuff)","December 14, 2014","false","39.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although it wasn't entirely a bad entry in sandbox action/adventure games it mostly certainly left a lot of room for improvement which I feel was successfully implemented in the sequel (or at least its expansion).\n\nNow, I must warn to not to do what I did – Which was skip to the expansion immediately without playing the base game first. I warn simply for the fact that your character's achievements and equipment are meant to carry over into the expansion from the base game. If you begin Flying Fortress not carrying over anything from TW2's base; Flying Fortress will start your character with far more than your character needs greatly reducing the challenge that Flying Fortress may have otherwise offered.\n\nNot only did I find myself starting off with the best of the best there has been very little acquired during my six hours of play (Armour or Weapons) that improved on what I had.\nAnd this game is Loot-Heavy! The looting element in Flying Fortress is on par with the obnoxious pack-ratting found in games like Torchlight so my mistake of starting the expansion first has pretty much killed a lot of the game's excitement during exploration.\n\nI feel the best approach continuing onwards is to relay my experience in contrast to The Elder Scrolls games which you more than likely would've asked first and foremost. To summarize: Flying Fortress has sacrificed the massive scope of TES landscapes for a grand improvement of visuals. Reality Pump appears to have aimed for enclosing more relevant and interesting material into a smaller sandbox area. Teamed with very good optimization (modern day developers please look this word up it will help your efforts tremendously!) Flying Fortress plays like a much more aesthetically appealing Skyrim that cuts to the chase.\n\nSo if I could choose either Two Worlds II or Skyrim? Skyrim simply for the fact of hosting much more content and therefor longevity. Being able to afford both, however, it would be hypocrisy for TES fans to turn their noses up to Reality Pump's entry in sandbox action/adventure genre.\n\nPrice Recommended: $20 w/ Expansion","April 28, 2014","true","14.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However the voice acting is probably the worst I have ever heard in a game ever - it's like it was scripted and acted by someone with the emotional depth of a 10 year old. Your character is frankly quite creepy too since he often has a good laugh after killing animals.\n\nI would have said that this was an ok buy if you get it for a dollar or two as I did but now having got half way through chapter one the game has started crashing frequently shortly after I summon a creature (this is on a relatively recent Mac BookPro). So at this point I'd not recommend it to anyone with a mac at any price - no clue whether it is more stable on windows.\n","June 20, 2015","false","22.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunantly it wont be because the game is good.  I laughed because of the voice acting, I cried because I had to listen to the voice acting and spent 10 dollars on the game. Then I was in amazment because the graphics were so bad and because the game made me do all that. All jokes aside though, if you want a game similar to skyrim then scoot on by this one.","December 30, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main campaign is pretty long although it feels a bit rushed at the end. The main story is quite cliche and the A.I, pretty dumb. Playing archer while trying to complete every side quest allows you to oneshot pretty much every important boss. The entire game is just the masterpiece of mediocrity.\nHOWEVER the Pirates of Flying Fortress DLC is an insane improvement. A gameplay is still nothing special and fighint repetitive as hell, neverthless the plot is great, the voice acting and charachters are really sweat, endings are fairly touching (...yet they don't really care about your previous actions, you just have a single decision to make and that's it). I do recommend buying the game together with the DLC in some sale (I got both of them for like two (bucks), play the main campaign if you really have no better games in your sigh or skip it and start with this great DLC (although you will decide to do this you will face a very challanging game if you won't know the gameplay).\nOh, and the graphics are meh.

Have to say wasn't that impress by the campaign and I only managed to play two hours of it before quitting. The rest of the time however was spent playing the amazing multiplayer. Now it's noway near perfect but it's been hell of a fun time playing with friends.\n\nYou can create a character and play a fighter, mage, or ranger with various sub classes that specialise in sword and shield, two handed ect. which give you a starting bonus in those areas. When you create your character you proceed to choose a hub server to join. These "hub servers" (as I'll call them because I actually haven't played in a while and a have forgot what they're called. :P) are a place where you can buy equipment and socialise with other players. From here you create/join groups and head off to play.\n\nMultiplayer missions are pretty good when playing with friends, some can take a couple of hours to complete but they are entertaining to do.\n\nIf it's on sale for over 75% off, get it if you like action-y RPG's that you can play with your friends. ;)","August 5, 2014","true","72.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However the voice acting is probably the worst I have ever heard in a game ever - it's like it was scripted and acted by someone with the emotional depth of a 10 year old. Your character is frankly quite creepy too since he often has a good laugh after killing animals.\n\nI would have said that this was an ok buy if you get it for a dollar or two as I did but now having got half way through chapter one the game has started crashing frequently shortly after I summon a creature (this is on a relatively recent Mac BookPro). So at this point I'd not recommend it to anyone with a mac at any price - no clue whether it is more stable on windows.\n","June 20, 2015","false","22.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, there is no way to change time or fast foward time (i.e. Elder Scrolls games you can wait or sleep till the sun rises), so if you made it to a town and its night time where shops are closed and people are locked up in their homes you have to... leave the game running or explore.. or something till the sun rises. Lockpicking and pickpocketing is by little minigames that gets old fast. I can't bring myself to continue playing single player mode at all after an hour or two.\n\nMulti Player\nNon-shared loot can get frustrating if you are not playing with friends. A little more fast paced than single player with a lot of mobs to kill to keep you busy, and the extra mobs to help you level up faster. If you party with lots of people who like to summon mobs it will turn into a sh*tfest quickly. Also no more than 2 melee summoned creature per target; the rest of your summons will stand still and do nothing blocking other players since you can't walk through mobs.  There are different types of Multiplayer settings, I spent most of it on Adventure playing with a friend. I randomly disconnected and saw I was accused of using a trainer and got temp banned. I was low level and poor with little to no equipment upgrades, a lot of empty accessories (no gems), ran away from a bunch of mobs, while using lots of health potions and half dying all the time with my friend. There are better games to grind that have a much larger community (say ~50 players max online/ingame).\n\nBTW I didn't have any problems with registering (I have a router + firewall) and only gave general information (don't think they have to be true either).\n\n\ntl;dr\nBought this game on sale for ~$5 including a DLC.\nDon't bother with this game unless you have friends to play with in multiplayer and at the really low price I got it for.\n4/10 (+2 sale price, +2 magic crafting system).","October 16, 2014","false","25.1"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","3"

There is a decent amount of habilities, magic spells, weapons and armors to buy and upgrade, but they are bound to level, meaning that they'll only appear on the game world once you reach a certain level, so if you want to relive the thrill of finding that overpowered legendary item in a chest deep down a cave full of perilous monsters, forget that. All you're gonna get are some lockpicks, a medium healing potion and a wizard's hat. And that is if you're a warrior. 'Cause if you play a mage, the game will make sure that there's a warrior helm in that chest, just so you won't be able to use what you find, a very common issue in modern RPGs.\n\nThe game world is pretty large, composed of some three major islands, each one of them themed around something like middle-east, asian, and european designs of builduings, flora and fauna. There are plenty of quests to be done and there's a fair amount of NPCs, but none of them are memorable or even good at all. You're going to do a lot of running around, a little bit of riding around on a horse and even less sailing around, because you only get a boat too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ late, and that is another issue with modern RPGs. What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with giving the player a ship from the start, so he or she can have some fun sailing around the islands? Anyway, It seems like there's a lot to do, but there isn't, really.\n\nWhich brings us to the last point of this review and, by far, the worst thing in this game, not to mention the reason for me to not recomend Two Worlds II to anyone: The game suffers from a all-too-common rushed ending. The first major island will take you quite a long time to complete, since there's a lot to do and see. The second one, a little bit less. The third you can almost skip completely, since there's very little to do on it. The plot is also extremely rushed, with a huge deus ex machina right at the ending, throwing everything you've been doing on the main quest since the start out of the window.\n\nAll in all, this game dosen't deserve more than a 5/10 and I would only recomend it if you, like me, have played pretty much every other RPG on existence. You might have some fun with it, but you would probably rather play something else instead.\n\nGameplay - 8/10\nSoundtrack - 6/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nContent - 4/10\nChallenge Level - 5/10\nReplayability - 3/10","October 6, 2014","false","30.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Ranged and magic combat is weak, though magic has a unique touch of "mixing and matching" your own spells (i.e., placing fire element, water or ice element to a "shield-self" spell, causes different effects.) Though general combat targeting and visual impact is weak.\n\nVoice acting is sub par.\n\nInventory screen, general interface (including options menu) is horrendous.\n\nStory is relatively interesting but broken by the horrendous game mechanics.\n\nIt's got good concepts, but just terrible execution.\n\nIn truth, I managed to finish this game once a long time ago when games were less... Impressive. But now that there are so many titles similar to this game out there, you can easily notice the flaws of Two Worlds II. Frankly, even the menu of this game is downright terrible. Despite the fact that this game was on sale for only 10$, I still recommend spending your money elsewhere.\n\nIn short, it's a hard game to get into. But once you overlook everything.... You'll be able to have at least one or maybe (though doubtful) two playthroughs.","December 9, 2013","false","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This is a game which i would recommend to my friends because of the quality of the graphics and the storyline overall. Although nearly every games needs to have a downside and the downside for this game is the bugs which aren't too bad but it starts getting annoying. But i would definitely recommend this to any RPG fan or a fan of games in general. 9.7/10 The Bugs need to be fixed other than that this game is Superb.\n\nOne of my favourite games that were made in 2011. So good and so much things to do. It is almost the ultimate game. I Hope they make Two Worlds 3 and many more of this Asthetically Appealing and Graphically Beautiful Game. If they don't i will be very disappointed. If they make Two Worlds 3, that will be the ultimate game because the graphics are great for a 2011 game and if you made the graphics a bit better, then it might be best Third Person Series.","December 20, 2013","true","17.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

For full enjoyment of the the game I must recommend using a Game Pad such as the Logitech F510/F710 or similar. The game offers large maps to explore and if one prefers one can simply roam the maps and gather loot and ressources taken fromn enemies, animals, plants or found in maze like caves, chests or if skill good enough from places in buildings entered by picking locks or getting money from gambling or pickpocketing (both difficult unless high skill or great luck) - of course one can also get new objects both through quest and trade and one can trade objects/loot away also. High Lock picking skill is a must in this game. Also don't overlook that you can also scroll on teleportation maps so that you can travel to previous locations.\n\nA prominent feature is also the ability to, after breaking down loot into elemental components, being able to combine components and to upgrade items (both demanding aquired and spent skill points for abilities). Though the player have a map of locations then in some cases in can be difficult to find a few of the locations (or to get there).\n\nThe game is to large extend non-linear but as it is story driven one ofcourse must perform some tasks to unlock other tasks or possibility of access to places...\n\nI have played the game for more than 200 hours and I have yet to finish the expansion. But with repspect to the Two Worlds II base game itself then I think that there were only two things that really sucked for me.\n\nOne is that one at a time gets the task to have to participate in a horse race to advance in game and that can be rather difficult for many (however one can cheat by placing personal teleportation stones in advance and use these to get around, this will leave you with map markers that won't go away but at least will solve the horse race problem)(Placing of personal teleportation stones on selected places on some maps will help the player a lot getting around with greater ease).\n\nThe other thing is the final "boss" battle which in my taste is too difficult...\n\nBut all in all the Two Worlds II game will offer many hours of entertaining game play for those liking the genre and style that this particular game offers.\n\nPersonaly I think it is a great game that I will recommend other people to try if it appeals to you through the description given...\n","June 23, 2013","true","339.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The entire game world felt wooden; awkwardly imposed cut scenes and voice acting, being restricted to a 'demo version' unless I 'registered' the game with personal details and a slight swaying of the camera when the PC runs (I've never been sea-sick before, but I'd imagine this game will cause nausea in some).  Maybe they take more time to accustom to, but the controls also seemed iffy: I tried jumping from a staircase, but had to try a few times before managing to succeed.\n\nSeeing the positive reviews on here there's probably more to this game, but there's something about two worlds that just makes me want to hate it; right down to the big bad who's outraged by his prisoner escaping, but is too busy to walk over and stop it.  Maybe if I'm bored some day I'll give it another shot, but I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone purchase the game.\n\nEdit: maybe it was an intentional part of the tutorial/escape sequence, but the AI seemed awful.  I was chased by a swarm of guards, then ran back past them a few times.  None of them could attack me unless I stood still.","May 24, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I.E. facebook, myspace, twitter, instagram. etc.. sure you shouldnt have to cause A.) you paid for it. B.) you've already given out this info to steam. if youre seriously worried about someone "spamming" ,"Stealing" "scamming" it's not gonna happen. You're more @ risk for that with social websites/media(which i might add can be notorious for ad's an spamming). If people can beat and play Morrowind, theres no reason someone cant easily put 20+ hours into this game. Graphics are dated in certain aspects(hence my reference to morrowind), a bit of trial an error, multiple saves and some persistence to start with an you'll be easily coasting a chunk of your day into this game. that doesnt include multiplayer. this really is a great game, an it doesnt deserve the amount of hate it's been getting for people judging a book by its cover. I decided that after spending about 20hrs into this game(will be spending prolly another 20+ more) because my experiences didn't match up with the hate mail on the DRM info.

Encounters can prove difficult at the start of the game and taking on more than one foe at once isn't always wise.  Once you're on par with the local wildlife at the start of the game is when Two Worlds 2 really starts to take off.  It's easy to forget about the storyline as you get sucked into all of the side quests that really seem to propel the game more than the story but it's just too much fun to stop.  I find nothing more enjoyable than venturing off into the distance just to find out what's there, destroying whatever stands in my way, and gearing myself along the way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathobbit/recommended/7520/","fathobbit","FatHobbit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fathobbit/","343 products in account","After two playthroughs as a warrior first and mage second I can say it is MUCH more rewarding to play this game as a mage. The spell system is first class, with the card system allowing you to make your own spells, with almost limitless potential. Add more cards to make it more powerful but cost more mana, add modifier cards that effect the way the spell works, such as a firebolt homing in on the target, splitting into more than one bolt (add more cards get more splits!), add a card that makes it ricochet off the target etc. The feeling you get when you finally get that spell to work that fires a frostbolt that splits, and summons a creature where every split hits. or that heals you when it hits is great. You feel like a mage testing his own spells and crafting exactly what works for you.\n\nPros to the game for me included: Graphics are still amazing even being almosted 3 years old, the lock picking mini game is enjoyable and requires some skill, and you get a lot of bang for your buck in that the main story is relatively long (1 1/2 playthroughs netted me over 60 hours, mainly just doing the main questline and whatever side quests I happened to bump into). As the game progresses I found all the creatures still gave decent challenges, there was no level of gear or skills I obtained that made me one shot all the mobs. I am sure though, that there is some derivative spell I missed that can do this if you can find it :)\n\nMinor cons for me included the amount of cut scenes and dialogue. You will spend a lot of your time listening to the charactors talk. At higher levels you can also summon a lot of creatures that your charactor doesn't clip through, and when you are not in combat, they crowd around you. I found far to often that I had to stand and wait the 60 secs for them to despawn before I could move as they had boxed me in. I also had a lot of random crashes, mainly during cut scenes, the game would hang and would need to be shut down and restarted.\n\nThe major con I have with this game is the final boss fight. Most RPG's, and this one is no different, require you to level, increase skills to take on harder challenges as the game progresses. Imagine my surprise when I discovered all those spells that gave me fuzzy feelings when I finally got them to work were absolutely useless, as you do not fire one spell at the boss. All the potions I had crafted were useless, resistance potions had no effect on the damage I took, damage potions had no effect on the damage I dealt (as you don't cast spells at the boss). Reflect and shield spells I had crafted had no impact on damage taken either. Only the health pots were usable (and I went through a few of them). All the time finding the best gear, upgrading it, adding crystals useless as well. I found this out as I decided to respec to add a lot more health at the expense of damage, but the damage I took was the same, as it appears to be a % of your health.\n\nAll in all apart from this, Two Worlds II provides an enjoyable experience, fun spell system, and deep, though not very original story. As it seems to come on sale a fair bit, paying $15, or $7.50 for it is well worth it, but I also think it is worth the time full price.","December 29, 2013","true","70.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Sure some animations may be a bit clunky (however improves a bit with the dlc) the conenct itself is a real good time. At first things feel real strong against you with being 2-3 shot with the block being very strange mechanic only blocking a small amount of damage at the start and your shields do block projectiles but its more for apperance than anything you cant actualy raise to block.\n\nThis being said the Progression system in this game made me love it especially spell crafting, using heaps of different combinations to make your own spell is pretty awsome(like anvil tornado or spraying projectiles with summoning).\n\nIf your willing to overcome its buggyness to get use to the games many unique systemes(sailing for dlc, magic crafting) and want a rpg to kill alot of hours I reccomend go for it.\n\nAlso if anyone know any other action/rpg or anything where you can sail id appreciate it","November 25, 2013","true","25.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am also aware that there is a very broad magic system, as far as creating your own spells.\n\nIf you enjoy RPGs get this one, if you don't have the $50 right now, you can wait for a deal, and live.","February 14, 2011","true","31.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Magic is where this game truly shines; mix and match effect and delivery cards to make spells, mix spells to get cooler spells, make yourself a floating shield of garbage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/headdopus/recommended/7520/","headdopus","Armuyr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/headdopus/","105 products in account","Two Worlds II is an RPG from Reality Pump Studios. You start out the emperor's prisoner, but are quickly freed. Your major goal is to disrupt the emperor's plans and defeat him, bringing the land back to peace. Overall, it's a worthwhile play if you like RPGs. However, the game has a number of shortcomings that may not make it enjoyable for you. (Note: I did not play any multiplayer games, so I can't comment on that).\n\nPROS\n-Tons of quests, which keeps the player engaged with the game. Main storyline is good overall, and there are a few twists along the way and at the end.\n-Beautiful graphics, scenery, and locations, all throughout the game. Many good environments/settings.\n-Unique and customizable magic system. In brief, through the combination of element cards (fire, water, etc.), carrier cards (e.g., summon, bolt) and modifier cards (e.g., damage, ricochet), you create spells. Tons of possibilities and combinations.\n-The crafting system is also different, but good. Here, crafting means upgrading your weapons and armor and adding crystals. Break down your old or unused weapons/armor in order to create the upgrade materials, so nothing goes to waste.\n-Going along with the previous two points, there are tons of ingredients for potions. Can spend hours trying out different combinations to produce the most powerful effects.\n-Leveling up focuses on developing skills, so you can tailor your skill set to your playstyle accordingly.\n-Can have up to three active armor/weapon sets at once, which are easily switched to with the press of a button. For example, I had equipment set up for a warrior with sword/shield, a warrior with 2h hammer, and a mage.\n-I've seen people complain about the voice acting, but I thought it was okay and brought the game to life a bit more. Same goes for the dialogue itself. The cutscenes throughout the game were generally great and helped move the story along.\n\nCONS\n-While the storyline is fine, it isn't set up well. There was no recap of the first Two Worlds, so you're just thrown into it with no real explanation of why Gandohar is bad and how you were imprisoned.\n-Inventory management is terrible. Weapons/armor do not stack, so even if you kill a bunch of Varns and have 12 of the same exact sword, they show up as 12 different items. So when you break them down into crafting materials, you do it one sword at a time. Quite tedious. You cannot purchase multiple items (like potions) at once. Potion ingredients are not grouped by effect, and you cannot reorder any items. Despite being able to have three equipment sets, when looking at equipment, only the currently active items are highlighted; there is no indication which items are being used in other sets, which is problematic when selling and crafting.\n-Crafting system is a major strength of the game, but when upgrading weapons/armor, you have to wait 5-8 seconds for it to finish upgrading before doing it again. Can only upgrade one level at a time, even if you possess enough material for 10 upgrades. In other words, it's tedious.\n-I did not like some of the gameplay elements. Sometimes I was standing directly in front of a chest, and it would not register so I couldn't open it until I moved one or two steps to the right or left. Riding around on a horse is frustrating; I didn't bother after the horse race quest. The camera always wanted to zoom in, and I like playing with it zoomed out, so I was constantly adjusting it.\n-The final boss battle was pretty blah.\n-The Pirates of the Flying Fortress DLC starts out promising, but ends up being 7+ hours of fetch quests. I'm glad it came with my initial purchase and that I did not spend any extra money on it.\n\nOVERALL\n-Tends to be an engrossing game, but the shortcomings (most of which center on playability) do make it frustrating at times. I feel like the game did the bigger things well (graphics, settings, quests, crafting), but the little things poorly. If RPGs are your thing, you'll find it worth your time. Otherwise, skip it.","November 28, 2013","true","77.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Single play and on-line play.  In single play you can only play as a guy.  In online play you can play as either sex-and the women look a little more like normal women than in most games(they coulda made em a "little" more attractive I think).  Anyway, theres quite a bit to do in the game.  You can follow the single player story, go to online play and hook up with other people, start and build a town that you "own" and invite other players to visit and shop there...Its not just about jumping into a dungeon and swinging a weapon.  The voice acting isnt wonderful but it works and the graphics can be a little hard on the eyes sometimes if I remember right(a little tearing I think).  The online community doesnt seem to be huge but its friendly.  Ive never had an issue hooking up with others to play cooperatively.  I recomend the game very much.  You havent bought it yet??

I have seen comparisons to Skyrim/Elder Scrolls games and will say that I think that is somewhat of an unfair bar with which to compare it.  I played the original Two Worlds and found this to retain some of the nice features of the original (making all materials usable, the ability  to tailor weapons to work best against specific foes) while dumping some of the lesser features (the horse combat, which, while a neat idea, never worked well). The ability to tailor the character skills to my style of play was a definite plus to the game, allowing me to make the character I wanted as opposed to following a class type.  The main storyline was decent, but the side quests, while sometimes fun, were rather generic.\nI found the exploration in this game to be rather limited.

Although the gameplay was very similar, I felt the plot that was more absorbing for me (perhaps it is my deep-seated longing to be a pirate of old).  The humor was great and the side quests seemed more engrossing than the main game.\nAll in all, I can recommend this game when purchased at a discount for someone who is looking for something familiar and somewhat generic to waste a bit of time and follow a story.  I would recommend against it for someone looking for a cutting edge game that has something new (or, had something new 3 years ago).","May 27, 2014","true","219.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You can play a melee (in fact i am cos i just dont do mages) but you feel like your thrashing about more than tactically fighting. Once you learn that you can easily get behind larger beasties it gets easier.\nSome of the resistances on mobs are not obvious (dunno if im just missing something but the manual tells you sod all ).\nAfter 24hrs i still dont know what some of the stats on weapons mean. Nothing in the manual.\n\nBasically, its a pretty good solid action rpg with a nice world and decent visuals. If some of the finer points were more obvious, ie stats it would be better but this is not going to ruin the game.\nIf you enjoy the likes of Skyrim and you see this in a sale then for sub £5 you will get alot of gameplay and some decent RPG hack n slash.","August 24, 2014","true","24.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
