Unless I don't understand the controls, you can't control the direction of your ship... only backward or forward.  Even Tom Hanks had side thrusters in Apollo 13.\n\n2) Buggy.  Sound goes in and out (I've checked my machine and settings.. definitely on the side of the game).  You can travel through ship models... I've designed 3d spaceships for games before and this isn't a hard issue to avoid.\n\nI DO recommend this game as it has a lot of potential.  I suggest they model their flight mechanics as Allegiance did, which is considered semi-Newtonian.","August 11, 2014","true","0.9"," 72 of 94 people (77%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","77","72","94","16","1"

Lieutenants have an alarming tendency to order captains (and even generals) around, and it's done with complete impunity. It was hard for me to suspend my disbelief in that area. Further, there is an outsized amount of profanity used by a particular pilot, and it seems to be gratuitous rather than character establishing. (Maybe it's just me.)\n\nSpeaking technically, the game does have some nagging, but mercifully un-fatal bugs. The first is that the Ingress/ hacking loop still delivers invalid codes in some situations. It's incredibly frustrating to select what should be the right code, only to have it fail...and be taking fire from a number of turrets at the same time. Also, there's an occasional graphics glitch where a "sun" overlay gets plastered all over the center of your screen. (The problem can be quickly fixed by selecting a different screen resolution, and then reverting.)\n\nEvery once in a while, a rough edge in overall experience design makes a glaring appearance. The most notable of these was a mission where you have to save some transports that are dropping through atmosphere. The success/ fail conditions for the mission are not at all clear at first, although the success condition is so low that I suppose you can shrug your shoulders a bit.\n\nMy final negative point is that "jinking" in a tough dogfight doesn't seem to be possible. If an enemy fighter succeeds in getting you "zeroed," you either have afterburners available for escape, or you're in big trouble. The only turning option you have seems to be heading directly toward your attacker, which lets them hammer you several more times before they overshoot. Hopefully, you're not in a crowd.\n\nBut the above paragraph leads me into what's really, really good about the game:\n\nEnergy management.\n\nReally.\n\nThere are lots of other space sims that give you the ability to transfer energy amongst three systems, such as shields, weapons, and afterburner. In every other such game that I've played, that energy management is fairly secondary. In "Battle Of Sol," it's front and center in a very neat and satisfyingly challenging way. Especially when flying the Hades(?), each energy reserve is pretty shallow. You have to keep your head in the ETS game, or you will be in enormous trouble. This lends a nice boost to the tension of combat, especially because the basic dogfighting isn't all that hard.\n\nThe criticality of the energy management also helps to create noticeable differentiation between the Hades and the Arrow fighters. Arrows don't let you manage energy transfer manually, and the afterburners are "all or nothing," but the regen time is fast...for two out of three systems. The bugbear you get to wrestle with is that shield regeneration isn't under your control - you have to escape from combat almost entirely if your Arrow gets mangled. This "personality difference" really keeps you on your toes, and is a great way to add variety where a whole bunch of different ships aren't a gameplay option.\n\nAnother great choice by the developers is the need to master the "slide" mechanic. In other games, the ability to keep your heading while changing your orientation is handy, if not necessarily required. In this game, you'll either get it or get torn to shreds. Giving thought to your heading and then engaging a slide is the only thing that will keep you effective against gun platforms and capital ships. Once you do get it, you'll feel very much more like an ace pilot, especially since you'll actually be able to do some good.\n\nAnother thing I like was the (seeming) overall homage to the reimagined "Battlestar Galactica." The UCS missions often feature percussion-heavy music that would fit right in with BSG, and the Hades guns seem to behave - and sound - very much like what you would find on a Colonial Viper. Maybe this was all intentional, and maybe it wasn't...but it's fun either way, and made me smile.\n\nBit Planet has really done some fine work here, and I think they could build a real challenger to Wing Commander and Freespace if they keep iterating and extending what they've got already. This particular game isn't an instant classic, mosty because it's not deep enough for that, but the seeds do seem to be there.","July 20, 2015","true","4.2"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","38","42","0","0"

The devs are also very responsive, I encountered a bug and it was patched immediately. Another patch dropped today so it is obvious the devs are looking to support this game. Very pleased and looking forward for a continuation of the storyline!\n\n\nOriginal Review\nThis game is an amazing accomplishment because it does something that a lot of these new space fighter games have not done, remind me of the old days. The flight mechanics are straight old school. Many have complained about the lack of strafe but old school games like Wing Commander did not have strafe. Slide however works exactly like it did in Wing Commander 3.\n\nI do have two complaints and please note I have not yet finished the game. The ships, while controlling great, do not feel to have much speed. There are afterburners but they are used up quick, which I do not mind. I just wish there top speed of the craft was higher. My second complaint is that I have only been allowed to pilot two different fighters. Again I have yet to finish the story line so maybe I will get additional starfighters as the game progresses.\n\nIf you are a fan of old school starfighters I highly recommend this purchase.","July 5, 2015","true","22.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

With about 70 min of game play I'm liking it, it was well worth the $15 I paid for it.  A lot of nostalgia value, feeling like Freespace or Starlancer, on a $15 budget.\n\nBut, MY JOYSTICK IS NOT WORKING.  I have an X-55 with a set of rudder pedals.  The game defaults to using my rudder pedals as the input device - which, for reasons, leaves me spining in space.  I'm sure that I can work around but using the whole HOTAS set up is out of the question right now.\n\nThat's not a deal breaker though.  Although I am I proud HOTAS user that's not the way this game is meant to be played.  The game plays more as a arcade then sim.  But that's fun.\n\nBottom line:  If you've played through the real old school space games then this is something fun to do.","July 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","27","43","7","7"

I will try to be as nice as possible....\n1) Game looks pretty nice, cap ships look cool and at first I thought "wow this is gonna be cool!"\n\n2) Hotas support is a real pain. I don't want to go into too much detail here but it took me hours to setup. I gave up trying honestly cuz I bought this game a few days after release. Now finally today I dedicated another 3 hours to trying to to setup my Hotas. I have CH fighterstick and CH pro throttle. It is SOOOO complicated with about 40 different axis choices and it doesn't sense any axis so you must do this manually. Would be easy without the maybe 15 or so subcategories for axis. I have never seen anything this complicated and I have played many space sims. Feels like they just threw HOTAS support in for us and said "you figure it out!". In the end of a 3 hour setup run I finally stopped trying to designate my throttle and rolls to any axis. I just shut them off and found out how to designate those controls to the keyboard. In other words, old school 90s wing commander style play from here out, Stick and keyboard. Still, I was determined to give this an honest try.\n\n3) Sounds Really rough here. When overheating you hear a loud "ping!". Thought I could turn that effect down by turning sound fx down and leaving music and master volume up but nope. Just turns down other sounds but that damn ping sound stays loud as hell! The weapon sounds are also really bad here. No real gun sounds and no real missile sounds. One good thing I will say is the voice acting is pretty cool. Well done in that department.\n\n4) Gameplay. Really simple, boring fighting. Made it 10 missions in. Only way you can tell you are being attacked is a red color in the corner of your ship. No feel of impact or sound effects to help you know. Also on the flipside it's hard as hell to tell you are hitting the enemy ship other than they visually take damage. Even after all the HOTAS nightmares the joystick randomly rolls while making fast movements. The CH Fighterstick CANNOT ROLL so this is a software problem with the game. This never happened in any space sims I ever played before. Very annoying. Also everytime to fire your guns the whole screen blurs up and shakes like crazy. Not cool man....\n\n5) Summary Guys, I thank you for trying to make a fun single player space combat game. I miss these types of games dearly as a big fan of the glory days of Wing Commander, Freespace, X Wing and Tie Fighter. However, this time...mission not accomplished. I am very sorry to write a review like this. But the fact that I paid money for this game is a damn shame. I have played fan made mods of Wing Commander and Freespace games that are honestly 10 times as good as this. Those were made by non pros. Examples would be Wing Commander Saga, Wing Commander Standoff, and about a dozen Freespace mods. I do however hope you guys try again sometime soon. But you need to take your time and make a good game. Make the game interesting. Instead of just checkpoints all the time give us real destinations. The guns need to feel like guns. Missles need to be improved greatly. The art style you guys used was awesome. IT LOOKS SWEET!! Also, next time you build a space combat game, make it with the HOTAS in mind from the beginning. Don't just tack in on after the fact. Space combat games died with Freelancer and I think a big part of that was the fact that this is the beginning of mouse space combat games. Alright, that's all I have to say. Once again, I'm really sorry to the creators if this sounds harsh......but it's all the truth. I respect you a lot for trying but this has been a terrible gaming experience for me.","November 8, 2015","false","1.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

True, it is in alpha, and this review will be based on my analysis on said alpha version.\nThere are a few issues concerning the sounds in game. Sometimes the game mutes a couple of sounds or on ocasion mutes the game entirely, but nothing too critical (and understandable. It IS an alpha version, so instability is expected).\nBut so far, aside from the thruster system and the power distributing systems, the game provides a very fun series of dogfights in space with easy to learn controls. The graphics aren't bad although the sounds should be revamped, mainly the weapon sounds.\nOther than that, I'll keep a close watch on updates for this game! I recommend it for people that liked games like H.A.W.X. and even Warthunder and even for those unfamiliar to this type of games!\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that a bit of diversity in the ships would be great!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuthaBuffer/recommended/282620/","MuthaBuffer","MuthaBuffer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuthaBuffer/","1054 products in account","TL:DR – Did you like Freespace? Do you like or even prefer narrative based space combat games? Do you understand that a team of 6 developers are not going to give you the experience of a AAA game? If you’ve just answered yes to those questions you will get something out of the around 5 hours of campaign available in this game.\n\nI felt compelled to write a review on The Battle of Sol. At the time of writing it is sitting with a mixed rating and that seems rather unfair IMO. I’ll be honest, there are so many games on Steam that if a game has a mixed rating or less I very rarely add it to my account, even if I got it in a bundle, and I definitely wouldn’t buy it. Such is the nature of a swamped marketplace. For this game that makes me a little sad that others almost certainly take a similar life’s too short approach and will be skipping this. There are so few games in the narrative space combat genre and this game is a decent game in its own right.\n\nFirst to what this isn’t, this isn’t indie Star Citizen or indie Elite, there is no open world. If you ever played Freespace that is the most similar experience, all be it stripped down in many ways, it is an indie game after all. It is a narrative experience played out over a series of combat missions, if that doesn’t appeal then this game probably isn’t for you. If you’re like me and grew up playing Freespace and its sequel and loved them, then there is something for you hear.\nI’m just going to reiterate, this is indie Freespace, be under no illusions of that. Freespace may have been years ago but the golden age of Interplay was created with a sizeable budget and development team at that time. Technology may have moved on but the dev team appears to be only 6 in size for this game which is not going to create the content equivalent to a AAA title even many years later.\n\nThe story is ok, certainly not ground-breaking but not appalling. The acting isn’t going to win awards but it’s not annoying either, to be fair I’ve heard a lot worse in games with much higher budgets. It’s not short IMO for an indie narrative game, but neither is it that long, you can complete it in around 5 hours if you are playing at a challenging setting. The missions range from great to ok, for me the game started strongly after the tutorial but tailed away towards the end as the focus was taken off dogfighting, which was a mistake IMO. You only get to fly two fighters, you don’t get to choose your weapon load out and most dogfighting you generally rely on guns anyway which is fine by me. However the controls are decent and again should be familiar to anyone who liked Freespace, just with less options for management, although you do get to give orders to wingmen at times. It plays fine with a 360 controller if, like me, you no longer bother getting the flightstick out for casual games, but I’m lead to believe there is joystick support. The graphics are ok and at 144 FPS maxed out it looks good enough but nothing special, it certainly won’t be giving Star Citizen any headaches in the art department, but luckily it’s a genre that doesn’t need awesome graphics to succeed. There is the option to replay any mission from the menu once you have unlocked it in the campaign and a number of achievements to unlock if you are that way inclined.\n\nThe Devs are very active with little fixes and very responsive to bugs and issues. My one major criticism would be that it seems to have left early access slightly too early. The devs were literally patching bugs as I played, but you can now play the game from start to finish without encountering a major game breaking bug and I saw very little glitches or minor bugs.\n\nIf you don’t go in expecting AAA quality there is a lot of enjoyment to be had from the around 5 hours of campaign. If you are a genre fan you should pick this up, if you’re not a genre fan it is still a fun game and better than others I have played on Steam with much higher review scores. If it’s in a bundle it’s a no brainer.\n","July 8, 2015","true","8.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

It's a little rough around the edges graphically (even at 1920x1080) and the controls take some getting used to (reminds me of Battlestar Galactica a bit), but I'm enjoying my experiences thus far.  Skirmish mode, for example, introduces not only the ability to dogfight a bit but actually has some sort of resource mechanic that I don't fully understand yet.  In short, Exodus of Sol has a lot of potential.

(I am looking at you Death by a thousand cuts!) So it obviously isn't very long game. It's still very buggy, but developers are trying very hard to fix all bugs. Bugs are really gamebreaking, for example your not able to finish a mission or you will spawn into an asteroid and die immediately at the start.\nThe gameplay is quite simple and fast-paced. You'll be flying two fighters, both quite similar as both have short boost and cannon with unlimited ammo. Each mission you'll get an objective (blow up a ship) and side objective (don't get hurt).\nThe problem is that there is basically just one correct approach to the missions. If you leave the main goal just for a while you will probably lose. This goes so far that for example you have to shoot down missiles going toward your fleet. However you must shoot them in correct order, since you won't have time to shoot the first one, if you were closer to the second one!\nThe game is not very open, in fact you will lose the mission if you leave the combat zone. There also is not too much variability, as I said you will fly just two ships and fight against 5 types of enemy ships. Interesting maps are also not very well used, for example the colony or asteroid field would be awesome for dogfights, but enemies were flying most of the time outside of the interesting stuff.\nIf developers fix the gamebreaking bugs and perhaps add more options how to finish missions, I could recommend it, but now it's not worth even the 10$.","July 7, 2015","false","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"
