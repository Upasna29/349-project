This is a glorified concept.  4 ships that you literally can't do anything with other than fly around empty space hoping someone else buys the game.  This needs to go back to concept and finish before you hawk it off on us as a  playable game.  What a major let down of a good concept.  Poor execution if I have ever seen it.  Money grabbing at its finest.","January 13","false","0.8"," 257 of 619 people (42%) found this review helpful 86 people found this review funny","42","257","619","86","55"
