This is the definition of pay to win. You can't do anything except get blasted by snipers unless you spend a few good bucks. Honestly I think this game is a joke. Not even worth your time. No tutorial, no real graphics that are original *cough* Mincraft *cough*, nothing. Just gamemodes filled with trolls. I get it, early access and whatnot, but honestly, PUT WORK INTO IT. Basically every game after Minecraft just copies their graphics, and this one is no different.\n\nIf there was a way to put like 15 thumbs down, I would do so. This game is a joke. The only actually ok gamemode is the survival one with zombies, but even then they are the most overpowered thing in existence (unless you spend money on good items, of course). Now, kids, don't rage at me for not liking a game you like, but this is horrid. I can't believe this game.\n\n2/10 for cool zombie gamemode at least.","January 9, 2015","false","2.1"," 341 of 376 people (91%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","91","341","376","59","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoomGeek101/recommended/302830/","DoomGeek101","Jonathan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoomGeek101/","131 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEDIT 2/8/2015: Okay, so this is my first time actually doing this. I never really do this kind of stuff. Mainly, because I'm lazy or something. But this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so much I had to write it. As people usually expect from a person's first review, it's okay, but not that good. My review was the first (And possibly the last.) time I actually cared about typing something in, other than some stupid over-used meme. Thanks all of you for reading my review!\n\nOkay so here's my overall expirence with this game, and yes, I know that it's in "Early Access":\n\n\nSurvival mode:\n\nSo, There is like, 20 players here, that speak russian. The game hasn't even started yet and people are getting trolled appearently. I'm watching people's towers just fall down by 3 people at once. Now that's just sad. It seems lots of people get trolled often, I mean, it is a stupid minecraft clone after all, gotta expect lots of children. After fooling around for about minutes figuring out the controls, I picked the M14. Then the game says it will start in about 200 seconds. Serously? Do I really have to wait that long? Why would anyone have to wait that long? So after building my small base, which luckily, nobody attempted to troll me, people started dying. Halfway through the timer and about 3/4 of the server's population gone. Are they spectating or do they get kicked out automaticly? Is PVP on now? Because it isn't exactly telling me whats killing people. Then, I heard Zombies, A LOT OF THEM. They were surrounding my base, and still, the game hasn't even started! My base was ruined in about 30 seconds. It takes way too many hits to kill just one zombie, and I mean extremely way to many. Oh man does this remind me of Unturned. So half my base is gone and I just got TOUCHED once by a zombie, and I'm at 20 HP. Are you serious? One hit doesn't just take like half? It takes nearly ALL OF IT?! This is insane. So after a few waves, I realised that there are only 2 people left. Me, and this Russian dude, again, he doesn't speak English. He seems to be chatting constant, not sure what he was saying, but I simply responded "Sorry, I don't speak Russian." And I'm pretty sure he called me a noob in english. Again, children are everywhere. So then seconds later, more zombies came and I died, and got automaticly kicked to another server or map. Wasn't sure which one, so I said screw it and left the game before it started. Wow, that was bad.\n\nZombie Mode:\n\nI jumped into a random USA server, which only had about 3 people. And it was pretty boring, all you did was either became a zombie with just a basic melee attack which kills people in 2 hits, or play as a human which means you're pretty much dead. There's absoutely no point of playing this mode at all.\n\nTanks Mode:\n\nThis is where the game just becomes complete garbarge. The tanks HURT MY EARS OH MY GOD. THEY ARE SO ANNOYING. You're better off listening to someone scream in your ears along with an airhorn going on in your other ear! Besides the sound, The movement sucks! Going up hills take FOREVER. The basic movement is decent on flat ground, but you're always going to have to go up a hill about 70% of the time. You die in 3 shots by other tanks, and again, for some reason, I can't kill anyone. This mode sucks. Moving on.\n\nBattle Mode:\n\nThis is just standard gameplay you'd see in a Call Of Duty game. The only difference is, that EVERYONE uses the Sniper class. Headshots are really, Really easy to get. I'm no pro or anything, but that's just really stupid to keep shooting people in the face for 10 minutes. My points don't seem to count towards anything. Can't figure how to earn points to win and never will. Next mode, I'm getting tired of this already.\n\nVersus Mode:\n\nRemember how Battle mode was? They're both the same! The only difference was that Battle mode can go up to 4 teams and Versus goes to 2 teams only. Why? Why create two different game modes just to have a different number of teams? Well, I could actually score points. So I decided to actually play something in this game for once. But then I realised the score limit was 500. EVERY KILL IS 1 POINT. There is absoutely no way we're going to win a 5v5 to 500 points! That's completely insane! Who thought that was a good idea?! The gameplay is the same as Battle, you run in, get shot, they got shot, you get the idea. The maps are very small, boxed up cages and are very limited for movement. You could actually spawn camp if your entire team is at their spawn. But then again, it'll happen to you next. You'll get spawn camped nearly half the match. Want to know the best part? The best part are the Pay 2 Win jerk offs. They walk in and destory EVERYTHING, with their stupid OP WEAPONS, their unorginal skins (Most likely ripped skins from some generic Minecraft skin website. Ugh.), and pretty much EVERYTHING. Anyone who would actually pay about $30 just to win a match is just sad, and they should be ashamed of theirselfs for even buying a single thing from the store. When someone with OP Equipment goes on the other team, you're a dead man. One shot kills will happen ALL THE TIME. YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE AND YOU WILL NOT LIVE. But luckily, whoever this kid was, he was a noob, and he sucked horribly. I tried all the weapons. The M3's range is sooooo short! 20% you won't be able to hit a thing! But as me and my team continued onward and after about what seemed like an hour, we FINALLY won the match. And now it was one of the biggest waste of my time. The game doesn't even say "You win!" or anything, it just teleports everyone to the next level! This game is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! The only thing I managed to get out of it is that I raised my rank, which I didn't unlock much. Just a bunch of medikits and useless stuff that won't make a single difference when you meet someone with a Pay 2 Win deal. Alright, so what's next on the list of crap?\n\nCapture Mode:\n\nI honestly expected some kind of "Capture the Flag" thingy. But instead, you had to capture what I like to call "Areas". The more "Areas" you claim, the more points earn. Wait, is that even how it's supposed to go? Because thank the instructions, giving me useful information. THERE IS NO INSTRUCTIONS, I HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF. Anyways, rage aside. By looking at the automap with your eyeholes, you can see what color a certain "Area" as. There are 4 teams, just like Battle. So which ever "Area" is claimed, it'll be whatever team color that person is on. To claim an "Area", simply walk into it when there is no enemies. If there is an Enemy on the same "Area" as you're on, you won't be able to capture it until only one team is left on it. That's pretty much it, it's boring and pointless, moving on to the last game mode. FINALLY.\n\nCarnage Mode:\n\nWow. That's it. I can't play this anymore. Carnage is just melee only. That's it. The only thing other than to use a shovel or a fireaxe (If you've unlocked it yet.) is to build stuff or to use your medikit (Which again, only if you unlocked it. Not like you could use it anyways). Thought getting to 500 points in Versus was bad? TRY GETTING 1500 KILLS WITH JUST MELEE WEAPONS. Once I figured out that the score limit was 1500, I quit. I'm done with this garbage game.\n\n\nOverall thoughts:\n\nI understand completely that the game is in "Early Access". But it gives no reason why the gameplay should have this outcome.\n\nI never thought I would see such a game on Steam. This game shouldn't even be here. I want this game removed from existance. This is the worst Free to play game ever made. And if you, the reader, if you're thinking deep and hard about playing this game just because "Ohz 1tz l0ks l1k m1n3cwarft". DON'T YOU DARE EVEN THINK ABOUT IT! This game is the absoute worst and makes Unturned a better game! Don't play this unforgivable garbage. This is absoutely the worst Minecraft rip-off on earth. Uninstalled, never playing ever again.\n\n-10/0 - DoomGeek101","January 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 445 of 513 people (87%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","87","445","513","79","51"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atari8BitComputer/recommended/302830/","Atari8BitComputer","Summer Hopeflyte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atari8BitComputer/","54 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI will try to watch my own language as much in this review, though this game being the satanspawn of COD and mobile pixel shooter games, I'm probably going to loose it completely. (Due to people going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the comments, and being completely stupid in general, I must put ---->>>>>>I REALIZE THIS IS EARLY ACCESS, BUT WILL THE GAME HONESTLY PROGRESS IN ANY POSTIVE WAY BY RECCOMENDING A PROCESSOR BETTER THAN COD:AW, AND WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MICROTRANSACTIONS THAT ARE OUTRAGEOUSLY PRICED? I THINK NOT. Oh, and if you don't belive this game is terrible, keep scrolling down past my review in the "Helpful" Section, 99% of the reviews are negative. TL;DR: The game's graphics are below par, I realize it is early access, but it's reccomending a better processor than COD:AW, ping is crap 99% of the time, lag, and MICROTRANSACTIONS. MICROTRANSACTIONS. Let me just say microtransactions are my mortal friggen enemy.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nA question you may ask, "But, why are you giving the game such a bad review if you only played for like 2 minutes?"\nThat question, my friend I shall answer in the review\n------------\n, I went in, took a look around, looked at the shop, of course, real money for items. OF COURSE. Then I went to servers, expecting to be able to test the game. NOT ONE U.S SERVER APPEARED. Only russia and European. That is a very bad sign that the creator simply did not care for the game's U.S downloaders, since telling from past reviews that european and russian lag has been bad as well, I went into the game, picked one of the THREE classes, walked out of spawn, then was shot in the face instanttainiously. I thought to myself "Well, at least i'll spawn somewhere else" I spawned again, only to be shot in the face apon leaving the spawn area...AGAIN.\n--\n\n\n---\nOh, did I mention there's no create server ability?\nSo I can't physically host a server for U.S to even test  the game mechanics by myself.\n-400/10\n------------------\nOkay so, I went into a europe server and played the game. AND GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING GOD\nThis game is corner sitting sniper simulator.\nMost of the time when you get shot you don't even know where FROM.\nI rate this game, again minus 500 rotten fruitcakes out of 10\n---\n(Hate away lovers of this game, as I will never look at your comments. The gameplay of this game is simply average as it tries to copy ace of spades.) NOT worth the 70 mb I used to get this game, and frankly I want to put that 70 megabytes under quarintine because of how bad this game is.\nAnd before you go into the comments to go complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me, not only will I NOT read your comments, but you're also yelling at someone for having an OPINION. Keep that in mind. And yes, I do know this is early access, I realize that the game will progress overtime. but to be honest, games that are pay to win like this with below average graphics, THAT RECCOMEND A PROCESSOR BETTER THAN RECCOMENDATIONS FOR COD:AW, do you honestly think this game will progress in ANY positive way when early acess is finally gone? I think not. Also, I need say that this game uses many recycled sounds and possibly models from stock unity games. Not very creative also as the guns are almost paper thin as well, and the developers put no effort into the aim-down-sights, as it's just a completely still 2D picture that pastes onto your screen apon left clicking, you also walk at normal speed while aiming down sights, which makes the sniper weapons completely overpowered.\n\nI also appreciate the people who rate this review up, as you feel the same way that I do, there are too many games like this in existance with microtransactions flowing out of it's ♥♥♥. It's mobile gaming and COD's love child. And I use the term mobile "Gaming" very lightly.\n\nIf you want a good blocky FPS game, Play Ace of spades, it's much worth the money and does not have any kind of in-game transactions, just gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, and before you go in the comments to go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on me for making some little mistakes, deal with it, if you say "But I haven't made mistakes" Then you clearly haven't lived life. If you guys would kindly help me get this review to the higher percentages of people afinding the review helpful, i'm hoping the developers will notice this and make some changes to the game itself, because the game has no potential right now.\n\nJoin my steam group "Mike schmidt reviews fans" For more intresting reviews!\n\n\n"Did someone sh.it in ur blockade 3d"\nMe: No, the game IS ♥♥♥♥\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMPAH67f4o","December 23, 2014","false","0.3"," 590 of 701 people (84%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","84","590","701","47","69"

Not at all defined. I'd rather eat literal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and chug ♥♥♥♥ing diarehha!\nGraphics: The N64 looked better than this ♥♥♥♥. The lighting is poor. The textures are simplistic as ♥♥♥♥ing paper. The draw view distance on "FAR" isn't FAR AT ALL. It stops at the medium view distance in Minecraft. So horrible ,but the graphics doesn't matter. Its the gameplay.\nGameplay:This is where it matters and it doesn't redeem itself here. The Default Mouse Sensitivity is high as hell. Moving the mouse a little bit makes you do a ♥♥♥♥ing 180. Although, oh boy, the first person animations. There's barely any. When you scope-in, there's no animation, just a poorly drawn drawing that looks like a 12 year-old post on DeviantArt. Can they at least try to ♥♥♥♥ing apply themselves for the development of this game?\nThere's classes in the game but guess what! THEY DON'T TEACH YOU HOW TO CHANGE CLASSES NOR HOW TO PLAY THEM. I was stuck on Sniper for ♥♥♥♥ing forever. Everyone looks the same. Just different color, not at all hard to tell the difference but that's where the bad draw distance comes into play. It makes the enemies and teammates clothes dark grayish so you can't tell them apart. I don't know if they made it like that or it's just a ♥♥♥♥ing glitch. Don't know, don't care.\n\nWeapons: As I stated before, I was stuck on Sniper because the game doesn't explain how to play. Therefore I'll just tell you the weapons for Sniper.\nThe weapons for this class is just....god awful! Of course, you get a Sniper Rifle and a Pistol/SMG. IM JUST KIDDING YOU GET A WEAK PISTOL. xxxddddd\nAnyway, the Sniper Rifle is an insta kill on headshot but oh ♥♥♥♥in' hell, it's weak on bodyshots. It takes 4 shots on someone to kill them with only bodyshots. Oh yeah, when you are in scope, you'll have the same speed as walking normally.\nSECOND WEAPON, THE PISTOL. Its weak. The Scope-In drawing is ok but there isn't an excuse of why isn't it in 3D like it is not scoped in.\n\nTHIRD WEAPON, NOTHING, WANNA KNOW WHY BECAUSE THIS GAME HAS A MINECRAFT MODE. But wait, isn't this Blockade 3D?!11!!/? Then why the hell there's 2D ♥♥♥♥ING DRAWINGS? Back on point, The third weapon is technically not and is a weapon. You get a stack of blocks and a useless shovel. The shovel can break the blocks the enemies and your teammates break. The stack of blocks can create cover and bullets can't break it...I think. To me, its the most defensive weapon in the game. Although it's technically isn't a weapon, its very useful!\n\nBugs and Hackers: Many reasons why I uninstalled this game is because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs and damn hackers. I looked into the discussions and one of the developers said that he/she is trying perfect a security system so the hackers won't be able to hack just like VAC on Steam-Original games. I like this idea but why the ♥♥♥♥ haven't they asked Valve to help them? They have a world class security system. What the ♥♥♥♥ were they thinking?\nPeople continue to complain about bugs and I've found one that destroys the point of the Shovel and Blocks tool. It makes the blocks fall through the ground. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. They couldn't one job, ONE JOB.\nPay-To-Win: WHAT? WHY? THIS GAME IS POORLY MADE ENOUGH! Bad gameplay, graphics, lack of explanation, horrible controls, and bad character design. The characters look like cardboard boxes poorly painted over.\n\nYou might think, "hey, you said you've only played two matches! This is a bad review." Oh really? Look at all of the reviews, the hundreds of other negative reviews telling when you play it, uninstall it.\n\nEnding Statement: Don't play it. There's so many hackers, bad modes, and bugs that never cease.\nThis game is a literal 2/10 as it has no originality or creativity. Although it's modes are are different, they seem the same. The gameplay is not fluent, "smooth" if you will. Why should I pay for weapons? Its an F2P game that seems that was made over the weekend. Why did Valve approve this? I might as well make a Minecraft clique clone that involves building and shooting. It's the most original idea! How is it not? It took me only 30 minutes to think of it! Anyways, sorry for wasting your time and upvote and downvote this for constructive critisism and I'll reply to ya.\n\nJust remember me from this.\n／ﾌﾌ 　　　　　　 　ム｀ヽ\n/ ノ)　　 ∧∧　　　　　）　ヽ\n/ ｜　　(´・ω・`）ノ⌒（ゝ._,ノ\n/　ﾉ⌒7⌒ヽーく　 ＼　／\n丶＿ ノ ｡　　 ノ､　｡|/ 天才\n`ヽ `ー-‘_人`ーﾉ\n丶 ￣ _人’彡ﾉ That's me.\n／｀ヽ _/　十∨\nNever forget.","January 27, 2015","false","0.2"," 212 of 261 people (81%) found this review helpful 108 people found this review funny","81","212","261","108","19"

This is hilariously bad, kinda like some kind of.....Uh....Uh...Well....CoD meets Minecraft? With ♥♥♥♥ tons of lag. I can't explain how I felt about this game, most of the time, it's not the kind of game that makes me rage, it's just so lame that I struggle to say anything about it. It just feels overall...Not good.\n\nI played this game for the same reason that I play many other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games. I wanna live the nightmare myself, I wanna see if it's as bad as people say, and it is.\n\nHere are a couple more negative points.\n\n-No matter what server I play on, the lag seems to be a real and permanent issue in all of them, close or far from me, and it gets really annoying. It's fascinating when you keep doing the Wesker shuffle all along the map.\n\n-Hackers. ♥♥♥♥ing hackers. Oh, so you are a little ♥♥♥♥♥ that doesn't wanna play zombie in zombie mode, and you just wanna hole like a ♥♥♥♥? Well, worry no more! There is a hack that allows you to zombify everyone! Even the ones that are really far away from you where you will NEVER ♥♥♥♥ING REACH THEM! And people seem to accept and even embrace that, what a ♥♥♥♥ing load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n-Every game mode, except for zombies, gets boring really quickly. Wait, nevermind, even zombies gets boring really quick, it's like mixing minecraft with CS zombie mods. Sounds good? Well, hackers and holing up forever and ever ruins that. You can build your own overpowered camping spot were you won't be reached.\n\n-Clipping through the map. Believe me, it happens. No, it's not fun when you are holed up nice and snug and you fall to the floor below.\n\n-Tank sounds. It's just a crappy sounding 1 or 2 second loop that not only feels like a cheap, poorly looped sound file, but also gets irritating in seconds.\n\n-Zombies seem to be longarms, cuz they reach you from 3 or 4 blocks away when you are not behind one.\n\n+It's funny when some dumb kid calls you a hacker because you can do stuff they can't. Never gets old.\n\n-This game is blatantly pay to win. Sure, you get some rewards after you level up enough, but the best of the best when it comes to guns can ONLY be bought from the store. Plus, the ♥♥♥♥ing armor! Basically, if you pay, you can get armor that makes it harder for people to kill you with bodyshots,  and a helmet that basically gives you two chances to be headshotted. Yeah, seems balanced to me.\n\n-This game is culturally diverse, you can find people from every filthy corner of this planet. The downside? They all seem to be minecraft humping squeakers with fascination for building ♥♥♥♥♥ and stuff like that. What a community!\n\n-Some griefers in zombie mode just wanna see the world burn....YOUR world. They will destroy your bases and walls no matter what, or they will intentionally get close to the zombie's reach when holed up just to infect their whole team in there. What for, do you ask? POINTS. ♥♥♥♥ING POINTS.\n\nEven if it's hilarious at times, the pain is not worth the gain.\n\nWell, at least controlling guns ain't that hard, and the menu music is half decent :P\n\nSo what can a simple woman like me do with this? I dunno, I guesss I could join the grief train and try to have fun.....Or better yet, PLAY ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING GAME.\nStay away from this one, unless you want to torture yourself.","February 6, 2015","false","3.9"," 123 of 144 people (85%) found this review helpful 47 people found this review funny","85","123","144","47","10"

I feel like I would've enjoyed and played the game a lot more if it only wasn't so P2W.\nI haven't personally expirienced any bans yet, I have no idea what the other reviews are talking about.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fast paced\n- Only 80MB\n- Has team and general chat\n- 8 Gamemodes (Actually 9, but look in cons), including 'Zombie' 'Tank' and 'carnage'.\n\nCons:\n\n- It's literally P2W. 90% of the weapons you 'unlock' you have to buy in the shop. Some P2W items include:\n1. A rocket launcher\n2. A helmet which basically makes your health 50% increased\n3. Miniguns\n5, There are 77 P2W weapons you can buy. Yes, I counted them. You can also buy some kind of tank.\n6. That number doesn't include the amount of grenades, armor, dynamite, reinforced blocks and other stuff you can buy.  They offer a mega back including 'all weapons' for 50 dollars. And I mean STEAM FUNDS.\nYou unlock SOME weapons by ranking up, but you only get a limited (And small) amount of ammunition, and after you've used those up, you need to buy the weapons in the shop.\n\n- 'Build' gamemode , in where you can build your own map, is only enabled for 'private' servers.\n- Private servers are servers that you can set up yourself, but you need to be a premium member to do that.\nAnd to nobody's suprise: Being a Premium member will cost you $1.60. For one week. So after seven days, you lose your premium status.\n\n- A LOT of servers that the game runs are empty.\n\n- Lack of costumisation options. All the options are:\n~ Mouse sensitivity,\n~'tileset', You can choose from 5 different standard texture packs,\n~'dynamic' Light on or off,\n~resolution , which goes pretty high. Which is good.\n~ Render distance 'near' 'middle' and 'far'\n~ fullscreen on or off\n\nCheers.","September 23, 2015","false","0.7"," 129 of 165 people (78%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","78","129","165","21","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePinkRaccoon/recommended/302830/","ThePinkRaccoon","The Pink Raccoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePinkRaccoon/","122 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBLOCKADE 3D is an free-to-play online first person shooter that is currently in Early Access that has been both developed and published by Shumkov Dmitriy. As you can see from the screenshots, it takes its visual style from Minecraft, but also throws in placing and destroying blocks as well, which allows you to edit the maps that you play on as you go. The game modes this game has are:\n\nBattle:\n4-way king of the hill. Capture and hold the centre of the map to earn points. Not sure how many points you need to win. It doesn't say.\n\nZombie:\nBecause it's not a game without one...\nA PvP zombie mode. Surivors v Zombies. One player is chosen to be a zombie and the Suvivors have 15 seconds to prepare. When a Zombie hits a Survivor once, they turn into a Zombie. Zombies have one life. Zombies win by killing all the Survivors and the Survivors win by surviving for 4 minutes and 45 seconds.\n\nThis game mode is rather poorly executed. In the 15 seconds that the Survivors have to prepare, groups of about 3-5 will run into the nearest building and will create an impenetrable fort by finding the nearest empty room and filling it with blocks in such a way so that they can see you from all the way at the back of the room. but you can't get to them, as the room is filled with blocks which allows them to gun you down if you attempt to get anywhere near them. Combining the fact that Zombies only have one life and the fact that Suriviors can place blocks at their free will tips the scales so far in favour of the Survivors that its just plain rediculous. Now, if the Zombies had more than one life, then I could see this being a better game mode overall but it gets boring very quickly, regardless of what side you are on.\n\nSee the following pictures for example:\nhttp://puu.sh/j6gxu/44c70676aa.jpg\nhttp://puu.sh/j6gyI/60e4d96f03.jpg\n\nCapture:\nNot capture the flag. This is an 4-way area control gamemode. The map is split up into 16 squares and capturing a square will passively give points to your team. Capture a square by eliminating any other players that are on different teams that are in that square. Get 5000 points to win.\n\nVersus:\nTeam Deathmatch. Teams Red and Blue fight to the death to be the first team to reach 500 points. Simple.\n\nCarnage:\nMelee only Team Deathmatch. Same as above, except melee only.\n\nSurvival:\nPvE Zombie survival. Work together with up to 31 other players to survive waves of zombies.\n\nTanks:\nTeam Deathmatch again. But with tanks.\n\nNow, onto the important question.\n\nIs this game actually any good?\nMeh. It's okay. Not the best game in the world, nor is it the worst. But I'm just gonna be straight here. It isn't really worth your time. The game isn't very exciting or gripping for an 'action' game. The community is probably most likely filled with children but who knows? Really, who knows. I mean, the game does have a leveling system. However, you are given the bare bones and the rest of the stuff you have to pay for. Not sure if you can get the stuff through the leveling system but probably not. But at the end of the day, this game is free-to-play. You aren't losing out on anything if you were to download it and play it just for giggles. I can't really shun this game that much because it's not like I forked out £15+ to play it. It was free.\n\nI'd assume that you wouldn't actually download a silly looking game like this and actually PAY for anything, would you? I mean, no one can be THAT stupid, right?\n\n...\nRight?\n\nConclusion:I don't reccomend this game. Aimed at a young audience. It has no real nutritional value for people who are actually sentient. There are plenty of other foods out there that are not only better for you but are less likely to give you heart disease or diabetes so yeah.\nKeep looking.\n\np.s. This game needed at least one semi-serious review.\n","July 20, 2015","false","2.5"," 71 of 83 people (86%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","86","71","83","13","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XKiwi/recommended/302830/","XKiwi","Generic EDM Producer™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XKiwi/","40 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is by far one of the most poorly designed early access FPS games I've ever played. It has a lot of problems, one of the most obvious being that it has shamelessly ripped off Minecraft's and Ace of Spades' design. All I have to say is at least this game is free, oh wait it's only "free to play" meaning this basically is another one of those pay to win titles. The part about this game that ticked me off the most is the horrible community of seven-year-olds who play this game. These little brats have some serious issues, and I mean SERIOUS issues. You walk a whole five steps in this game and you are automatically a government database hacker! I'm not joking when I say I had at least twenty or so kids called me a hacker the instant I shot one of them. That's another thing too, this game pretty much fails at including any modern-day fps game mechanics. Apparently it didn't occur once to whoever spent their time developing this game that they maybe should've added some spray patterns or at least something to break up the one click headshots. When it comes to the game's capabilities I have to say that I'd rather go on over to GameJolt.com and play some crappy Slender ripoffs. Speaking of which, they have this top-notch quality Slenderman skin that you can buy for only THREE DOLLARS. KUP TERAZ EVERYBODY! May I just say for the record that it's absolutely pointless to even call a game "Free to Play" when you basically would have to spend over 300$ just to get all of the game's included content? Come on guys, couldn't you at least make it so some of these weapons, skins, and other items were at least obtainable through some other method BESIDES microtransactions? Honestly I think the ingame store system is probably the most complicated thing about this ENTIRE game, because I sure didn't see any of the effort that went into it anywhere else. Onto a different topic now, the sounds of this game are pretty cheesy, it is a bit nit picky to say this, but the freakin rifle sound cuts off before it's done playing, and I'm pretty sure all of the SFX in this game were either ripped straight out of Ace of Spades, Minecraft, or anyother crappy block game that still manages to be better than this flaming bag of crap. Also, I'm pretty sure the main menu soundtrack is the only song in this entire game and yet it still somehow manages to be about as irritating as a kindergartener screaming bloody murder directly into your ears. It's pretty much just a little chiptune sequence of about 8 bars looped over and over AND OVER. IT PRETTY MUCH GOES INFINITELY. AND YES IT IRRITATES ME THAT MUCH. Continuing on now to the overall graphical quality design choices, were these developers just seriously lazy or what?! As I mentioned clearly before this game basically looks like a ripoff of those Minecraft Call of Duty servers, and don't get me wrong they're already pretty bad. But this... this game directly takes textures from popular Minecraft texture packs so shamelessly that it is without doubt a SIN UPON GAMERS EVERYWHERE. IT MUST OF TAKEN SO MUCH THOUGHT TO DESIGN THIS COMPLETELY ORIGINAL GAME. You immediately know the minute you see the default Unity "Sunny 3" skybox on almost every map that it's a mediocre game. Couldn't these guys at least have created a pixelated cloud and sun skybox to at least fit with their "original design choice"? This game is just so cringe worthy on so many levels it just makes me sick, and I'm genuinely sorry if this atrocious disease has been inflicted upon your soul. There's only one other game that I can think of that tops this as being my title for the "absolute worst early access game ever sold on Steam", and that one lucky game is "THE DEADLINGER". It seems like every single one of these wannabe FPS games are titled with CAPS LOCK CLEARLY LEFT ON. So let's do a quick recap, BLOCKADE 3D, one of the cheesiest "Pay to Win" 7 year-old communities on the Steam store. My final review is a -10 out of 10: Best worst game on Steam 2015. Hide your kids hide your skrillex and most importantly protect your unsuspecting friends from buying into this free-until-you-want-to-win game.","February 21, 2015","false","0.3"," 75 of 92 people (82%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","82","75","92","35","10"

(other than Brink...)\nLets start with the basics. You, as a fellow player, have just 3 primarys, a pistol, shovel, and TEH HOELY Brick. The Brick is used to build defenses when you get incoming fire. Why I find this stupid is because any a**hole in your team can easily destroy it, making the Brick rather useless. Imagine yourself where you are taking heavy fire, and need to take cover. You build a little fort to secure yourself, and OUT OF NO WHERE YOUR TEAMMATE DESTROYS YOUR FORT, THE BLOODY IDIOT GETS KILLED AND YOU GET KILLED. Sorry, my anger got the best of me. Lets talk about the weapons, YAY. Your weapons feel all the same. You get a SMG, a single shot rifle, and a shotgun. The SMG, is weak and USELESS. I felt like I was shooting a Nerf gun with this thing, dafuq?! The single shot rifle; OH MY GAWD TEH HEEDSOTS. This is one of the strongest first weapons when you start the game, since it gets heedsots left and right. The shotgun! I haven't used it that much, so I can say much about it. BUT WHO CARES!? Is might be like the others, terrible. Multiplyer, is broken. On every single server I've been on, there is AT LEAST one hacker. AT F*CKING LEAST ONE! Not only that, but spawn camping IS HUGE in this game. Walk out of spawn, boom ded. Walk out of spawn AGAIN, boom ur ded, not big surprise. It SICKENS me. But hey, at least the maps are great. Right? No. The maps feel, NO, ARE, all the same. Either is a little sqaure map, or a big map with 4 corners with all the 4 teams.\nI just can't anymore. This is the worst game I have EVER played. I wasted almost a hour in this s**t.  I'm BEGGING you, PLEASE, DO NOT PLAY THIS 'GAME'. Please, move along, and find a different game to play, just not this turd.

Unless, of course, you got a helmet, then it two shots you. And I could be wrong about this, but I only saw the helmet in the store, and there is no in-game currency. That's right, you can buy every item in the game with real money. There is a small bonus if you level up, but if you buy things with real money you get a better deal. The proper term for this is "pay to win" and is quite common along free to play games, but it is usually more subtle like costumes that give a slight stat bonus, or a faster way to get something that would have taken three days to build for free.

Something about it makes it have somewhat smooth gameplay and is as casual as you can get with a game. People have described this as a combination of Counter-Strike and Minecraft; I agree with that.\n\nYou start off the game like any freemium FPS game online. There's a server tab, a "shop" tab, settings, etc. It's what you expect. Gamewise, it's a blocky Counter-Strike that lets you lay blocks like Jagex's "Ace of Spades". The first game I entered was a blatant rip of Aztec (with a few edits) from CS:GO and all you have to do is have your team reach 500 frags. Now I don't know if I just suck or there are hackers because I noticed many people doing consistent headshots with AKs, snipers, and tons of grenades being thrown. Next game I joined was a "zombie" mode map. Whatever they did with the view range, I do not know - I could not see 10 feet ahead as there was a very black fog. The whole map was covered in camping spots with one entrance where you can wall yourself in (ala block building) until the end of the round.\n\nAs far as buying guns goes, I don't understand it. I saw the tab and every gun was blocked by 1) level requirements and 2) a $ currency. I am not sure if it's real life money or ingame. I would be surprised if it was real life as some of those guns are over $1 each. That's way too expensive.\n\nThe game just didn't capture my attention or give me enough fun for me to keep on playing so I uninstalled the game. It's still in early access so there's time for it to get better and I hope it does. I like the overall game but still it has a long way to go to be good. I'll admit the gun models look nice for blocks.\n\nGame runs great. I ran it on my "medium" laptop unplugged on power saver mode while running some stuff in the background at around ~30 FPS.\n\nObligatory Score: 5/10 (Early Access)","January 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 58 of 72 people (81%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","81","58","72","7","0"

And i mean like a WHILE.\nBut in this game you can't pay less than atleast 30 cents to get a single thing.\nAnd coming off the topic of Pay2win, comes the unbalanced guns.\nThe only gun that i could find that isnt insanely OP was the MP5.\nThe M14 can do insta kills in the head, and two shot if in body.\nM3 is a bit hard to use, but it's OP for sure. 1 shot kill if your'e about 3 blocks away.\nMP5 was your average assault weapon. From what i've seen from using this, it's pretty well balanced. (Except for the fact that you'll get more deaths to a M14 or M3 than kills with MP5.)\nSo over all:\nI give a 5.5/10\nI'll stay for the long haul to see if anything changes, but as of now Blockade isn't my favorite.","December 19, 2014","false","5.4"," 85 of 119 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","85","119","0","1"

I was just going to do a joke review but there's already so many describing how bad this game is that I don't really need to.\n\nArt-wise, this game just tries to ride off the popularity of another game, ace of spades. A decent and fun game that went to ♥♥♥♥ as soon as Jagex got their grubby hands on it, but enough of them. So you have the OH SO ORIGINAL block building based game. How exciting and not overused!\n\nThe community is absolutely atrocious. Filled with hackers in every server and children that ♥♥♥♥ talk about how good they are because they stole their parents credit card to pay for armor and instant kill machine guns and snipers. Which brings me to this.\n\nThis game is the poster child of pay to win. YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME!  Asides the M14, the starting guns and early unlocks are terrible. everyone else thats 10 levels higher than you or wearing armor will destroy you. watch as people wearing armor they paid real money for use machine guns get 100+ kills on the server and you struggle to manage 20. get ready to be spawn camped by another team and see half the server move to the winning sides team.\n\nThere is a progression system that lets you eventually unlock new weapons, most of them are just useless weapon like secondaries or smg's. some of which can take a whole magazine to kill an armored player while you have the pleasure of being 1 shot killed from any gun. And I forgot to mention, every gun is 100% accurate. Theres no recoil. every gun feels almost the same in terms of everything except firerate (with the exceptions of shotguns range).\nlevelling up gets you grenades, healthkits and rockets, but a limited amount that you will end up using all of it and then have to wait for either another level or buy them.\n\nThat's pretty much the gist of this game. And there are now so many free to play games that are almost carbon copies exactly like this all over steam. So Thanks Valve.

It is god awfully ripping off everything.\n\nIt rips off Call of duty, rips off Guncraft ( Guncraft textures were used or similar ), and console minecraft plastic texturepack. The game is pay to win, but really? That diserves its own failing. The minecraft with guns here makes a ton of more since than guncraft. Smooth charatcer models looking like smoother Guncraft ones. It's a counterstrike rip off. No sprinting. This is a MINECRAFT WITH GUNS! ._. All the way through even stealing textures out of it. Look up Minecraft console plastic texturepack. Looks like it. And the guns are pixel art half@#$@#'d I censored it. But the visuals are god awful just another reason to scream rip off. Guncraft and Minecraft ripping off. Somebody KILL THIS RUSSIAN GAME!\n\nOkay is the community any good? No. It has the " U NOOB " community and racist one which is more surpising. This game most editable prcedural cubic world? It's the opposite.\n\nMy experience, *claps * what a bad turd. This is just texturepacks from minecraft, console minecraft graphics, and Guncraft character models that have been smoothed out. Racist community or a god awful and get's on your case for calling it crap. It is crap, admit it. It a pocket picking unless you know what gun to use that unbalances the game. Confusing overlay. And currency that does not even exist.","December 24, 2014","false","1.9"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","47","60","0","0"

Avoid this ♥♥♥♥ scam of a game.\n\nUpdate: Posted information on a forum that I felt would be accurate here.\n\nBlockade is a scam and I was sad to realize it. Fainter(the forum developer) doesn't code(from what I understand)... and he is just public relations(not too friendly either). This game used to actually require strategy, but it's just a solid pay to win game now. It's popular amongst kids because mommy's credit card can buy superior items making winning as easy as breathing in real life. These kids feel like they are good at something when it's just the money that allows them to win. I knew a few people who could destroy any pay to win kid without paying a penny(damage and Zetti amongst a few). Savage was bad but got good scores because he played against level 3's and 4's who hadn't spent a penny whereas he bought every single item. He rage quit because he was still bad even after paying to win. That's my rant on the players. The game itself is an obvious russian knockoff of CS:GO and Minecraft. It's a money scheme made by 4 Russians. If someone is too dull to see something this painfully obvious and still wants to pay for stuff in game... then they can waste their money.

As if there was ever a "2D" version.  Upon originally downloading after finding as a fun game for a friend and I to play, we quickly mastered the no-skill no-bulletdrop domain filled with trolls, griefers, hackers, and the occasional Russian try-hard that unfortunately poors twenty thousand dollars in this game.  Originally, it had no fog in place to prevent sniping from all the way across the map.  Now that fog has been implemented, it only slightly nerfs the sniper.  However, it is still, without a doubt, the most OP gun in the game.  You unlock more guns of the various support (shotgun), assault rifle, and sniper rifle guns with leveling up, as well as more TNT, bazooka ammo, gernades, health packs, etc etc.\n\nAt first it was kind of entertaining, building block towers a million towers high that others just shoot down, killing unstoppable hoards of zombies in the PvE zombie mode, and driving tanks all over the place that can't be destroyed unless you have the bazooka ammo to do so (providing the tank doesn't see you first).  Then, as it takes longer and longer to level up and replenish your stock of ammo and health packs, the P2W becomes painfully obvious.\n\nIf you still aren't convinced, the gamemodes are overall very dull.  Tank mode, with tanks; zombie mode, with zombies, points capture mode (or whatever the heck it is called), where you just stand in a zone with a flag and rack up points  AS LONG AS NO ONE ELSE FROM THE ENEMY TEAM IS IN THE ZONE.   Capture the flag, where you grab the flag, run to your base, yadda yadda yadda, and team deathmatch (as far as I can remember).  Guns are boring, players are all Chinese, Russian, or clients that haven't hit puberty yet.\n\nSo long story short, this game went from bad to worse to one of the most god-awful pay to win programs probably devised by Satan himself.

This isn't a CoD game. It takes way more skill. why? well I'll tell you. A lot of guns are very strong, main ones being shot guns, snipers and a few AR's. You'll either suck badly or you'll dominate. You won't find kill cams in this game so learn where the shot spots are or learn to play better. Yes there are a few issues with the game but it's not as bad as people are making you believe. Please try the game yourself and don't listen to these minecraft fanboys. Seriously... xD. I actually play this more than CoD because it takes more skill and its fun to watch people call you a hacker just because you're better than them. Lag is minimal actually, its the latency that gets you killed. Hit detection is great.

You're a fan of the CoD series? You will love this....\nGet ready for the most immersive and combat accurate shooter out there to date. Graphics are full 1080p and will look so good it will appear to be real and give you the feeling you are in the combat zone itself.\n\nSome scrubs say this masterpiece is P2W? Well they're wrong. Your peashooter balanced gun can take down any pay to win child in only 24 head shots and 48 if you hit body-shots. The same scrubs also say the helmet you can by at the ridiculously low price of $0.99 is overpowered.... Like come on guys, when has surviving 3+ headshots been overpowered?\nYou can unlock 3 amazing and balanced peashooter guns from the beginning and progress your character until you are a skilled veteran of the game...  Or cough up mommie's credit card number and spend $50 and make yourself one of those pay to win scrubs The levelling on this game is brilliant and a prime example for future games.\n\nThe game's community itself is purely magnificent. Everyone takes losing well and absolutely no-one calls out hacker once they are killed. Every single member of the community is a trusted individual and are always good sports who take losing well and spawn camping is completely obsolete on the game. (trust me it never happens, no-one is that cheap in their kills).\n\nDo you just love running into that loud mouthed child who randomly appears in every game and ruining it improving the atmosphere? Do you love how he calls out 'Hacker' or 'noob' after every death? Well that's great too because this game attracts all those people together so then can bond and forge good relations.\n\nLiterally the best game ever, you have to play it for it will be an 'experience' like no other "game" can offer.\n\n9.8 / 10 - IGN\nThank you Blockade 3D for soaking up some of the children from the more advanced (and inferior) games on steam and 'taking one for the team' in your "Under 12 only Russian" community.

Me is getting blamed for Hack while I play like normal does. I just Aim for the head cause the Hitbox Head is 100% Easiier to hit than any other FPS games like Counter Strike.\n\nThere is a Hacker, but rarely case it shows who is the hacker of the game, because the game is too easy to get Headshot Instant Kill, unless you use Armor Head.\n\nGame is fun to bored, Map is uninspired. Items need to buy via money which is ridiculously high price, and why I should bother buying it. Because Free is the reason I play. Pay-2-Win is redeem to be high as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nCamping/Bug/Spawn Killing is real in here, there`s Not Even "Exist" in creativity of defending the base or capturing the area, cause they just being too braindead and decided to go screw yourself and kill some more. Even better if you have a crappy teammates who block your way or grief your own base for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason.\n\nFeel free to banned me in the game, I`m not playing to the cursed communities.\nOh do i say "Banned" pay $9?

You'll maybe get a bit of enjoyment out of it, and there is some sort of level system where you can earn new weapons that do about the same as before but with slight differences, but overall I just don't find this good.

(This also includes skins)\n\nThe community is OUTRAGEOUS, the first server I entered to had a kid bragging about how he made 10 dollars with CS:GO as another player praised him like he is some kind of god.. I don't even want to imagine the other servers.\n\nThere is NO tutorial, you just join a server and for some short time it'll just throw you in a loading screen showing you what are the controls (which by the way some of them are in other languages, I do believe it's Russian).\n\nThe gameplay is very clunky, for example.. if you jump and place a block above you there is a chance you will get stuck into the block and you will get disconnected from the server shortly after.\n\nAnd last but not least.. the servers are very limited, there is only servers from Russia, United States and Europe. (So you can expect bloody inmense amounts of latency (a.k.a lag))\n\nThis game has potential.. but the developer(s) must change a lot of things in order to make it a succesfull product.\n\nMy final veredict is 1/10.\n","January 20, 2015","false","0.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","17","18","7","0"

Dafuq?), I think I might be able to say a few words about this so called "early access". You see, when a game is early access and you make everything in the shop buyable in real money but not in in-game currency, one might assume the devs don't want you to buy the guns- maybe they are a little buggy, and don't want common folk to complain about how they don't work and such. This, however, is not the far from the truth. This game admitedly is p2w. No, really, it is. Sure, you can get a few decent guns from leveling up- which, by the way, is quite a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ during later levels- but they won't get you very far when people have rocket-launching steroid guns at level 6 when you get that gun at level 21. Sure, there is tank mode, which makes the game quite fair, but it doesn't help when 75% of your teammates are going around with rocket launchers thinking they 1 hit KO tanks (they do less damage than the actual tank cannon itself, haha). However, that's really all that can be said. Survival mode is useless and doesn't let you gain any EXP or KOs from such (not to mention, zombies are sanic fast), tank mode is the fairest yet most team dependant, and carnage is the biggest derp mode in the history of p2w kind. The rest is P2W. If you really have the guts and/or a spoiled 6 year old, then go ahead play the game. You'll have a great time if you're the latter of the two.","December 21, 2014","false","11.9"," 35 of 51 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","35","51","0","0"

Weapons hit hard as they should, building a trench or wall was a MUST if you wanted to hold your position and survive, let alone deal with snipers in more open ended maps, maps where fairly large and could be mangled to fit whatever your needs were.. A shame the game is pretty much dead from last I saw (let alone a popular playground for cheaters), because it was a pretty damn good game that mixed building stuff and breaking stuff together and showed that both could be used to make for some fun matches.\n\nAnd then came games like the current Ace of Spades, Guncraft, and even Blockade 3D here, who all share the same major problem: Building is a waste of time that gets you killed more than anything, and when you do build something, it just ends up hindering you more than helping, showing that all it is good for is pluging up entry points (which even then only lasts for a second before a rocket blows your blockade wide open).\n\nBut, see... While this game attempts to emulate the feel of playing classic Ace of Spades (going so far as to have a few assets that feel like they were illigaly taken right from the source), in reality it is probably the worst contender for Voxel-based builder and shooter, or should I say just shooter, since it fails in the building part.\n\nSee, while the classic and Current version of Ace of spades and Guncraft gives you what you pay for, this game is Free to play, but also it is free to play in the worst possible way in that every gun in the game besides the starter kit (and a select few unlockables that you gain though unlocking) require you to pay money for them, as well as all manner of gear such as helmets, TNT blocks, med kits and all sorts of other gear.\n\nNow, this isn't totally bad... Most guns are modestly priced, with some of the cheapest guns and a fair number of gear under a buck.. However, rather than allowing you to buy any gun from the start, the game has a leveling system that locks certain guns out, limiting your selection and making it hard to find a good gun to buy early on. It could lead to some wasteful purchases, buying a gun only to discover it is worthless compared to higher grade guns, some of the biggest guns costing 4-5 bucks, said guns being a minigun, an AA-12, and even a heavy sniper rifle that can kill a fully armored target in a single shot, and can make helmets worthless.\n\nBy the way, some of the guns you can buy are also rip-offs, weapons that are hardly worth the investment compared to other far better guns that can be aquired at the same price (or even less), meaning that you run the risk of wasting money. With the leveling system limiting what you can buy, as well as the risk of wasting money on sub-par guns, this could be the dev's way of multi-dipping into your pockets and making you spend more than you want to spend on a F2P title. Did I mention that there is also a lot of gear that is limited and can only be refilled either by buying them or as a small level-up reward?\n\nFans will argue that yes, you can get a selection of free guns, and every level up gives you a small reward package of free nades, medkits, rockets and TNT blocks. While the latter is somewhat useful, the guns you do get are still nothing compared to what you could get if you put money in the game. Sure, some of them pack a nasty punch, but even then they don't have the benifits that some of the better paid guns have (such as large ammo clips, helmet-piercing, high rates of fires, and in one case a grenade launcher that used ammo that you buy that packs on hell of a punch).\n\nAnd mind you, I was just babbling on about the guns. There is also other problems, like how insultingly small the 2 team VS maps are, how the 4 team Battle mode tends to get horribly unbalanced at times (which, by the way, no auto balance, so expect some really unbalanced odds often), with some of the teams focusing more on spawn camping than on completing the objective (and for good reason, since you get nothing for winning but all sorts of XP for killing people), and.. I hardly really played the other modes, but they were so forgettable that I guess that alone is enough to say about them. And of course, there is a cheating problem, but that is common in a lot of F2P titles, so it isn't worth noting.\n\nI don't like screaming pay to win, but this game certainly does smell of it, what with how the only decent weapon a F2P even has is a battle rifle that can one-shot people in the head.. Unless they have a helmet, then it takes two shots, which further proves how the dev really wants to get you to spend money on either getting better protection for your skull so you don't die as fast or a gun that can bypass said protection and make it a wasted investment that only serves to screw with free players. Not only does it stink of P2W, it also is an insult to building block shooters, where the one thing that could make it easier for a F2P player (building cover), is made pointless with how it only serves to slow you down and get in the way instead of providing cover that can help save your life and allow you to shoot from a covered position. It's all just run in and try not to die, and thus a waste of the engine.","February 24, 2015","false","19.2"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","19","24","3","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cry4Ever/recommended/302830/","Cry4Ever","Orendi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cry4Ever/","107 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLike we haven't had enough Minecraft-Inspired FPS, and it got old after the 10th clone.\nThis clone however, is one of the worst offenders, so far. It suffers from some awful issues that anybody who developed a frontal lobe could notice. Which is why a portion of the community hasn't.\n\nBalancing Issues:\nThe M14 practically dominates the field. It's a one shot kill if you aim for the head, which isn't hard because the heads are freaking huge and way too easy to aim at in this game. It's a two-three shot kill with bodyshots. It would be fine if the other guns wouldn't be utter crap compared to the M14. The M3 shotgun is a one shot kill, yes, but only if you're up at the enemy's face. He would probably pop an M14 round into your skull before you even get close, especially when the only GOOD maps are the expansive ones. The MP5 is garbage, it takes way too long to kill someone, about half a mag. No one ever uses it. The pistol is the exact same thing as the MP5 with a smaller magazine. Pretty much use the M14 and be average at aiming and you'll be good. Which is the problem. Just look at the kill counter on the top and you'll see it's nothing but "LittleBoy123 Killed BrazilianGuy098 with a headshot and M14!".\n\nLag. A Whole lot of it:\nIt's crazy how much lag there can be. The US servers couldn't be worse. I keep seeing my character jump back a few steps, and my connection is fine. Say RIP to your connection, because no matter how good, the servers will always mess with you.\n\nGriefers:\nBecause it's a good idea to allow others on your team to break your stuff freely, and then restrict us to 35 blocks a life. Yeah, good one, devs.\n\nThe Modes Are Just Crap:\nZombies- Wait 30 minutes for a match to be over, then be allowed to play as a human/zombie. Yeah, I'm not joking. Unlike other games, that let you join as a zombie if you jump in the middle of the match, they make you look at a horrendous spectator camera for more than 30 minutes. Uninspiring, tedious, and really boring. This mode overstays it welcome. Not worth any of your time.\n\nSurvival- God awful A.I. They just act brain-dead and walk right towards you, must faster then they should. The tip of their fingers touch you, and you're pretty much half-dead. Boring.\n\nTank- Good idea, I'll give you that. Although, the tanks control like crap and glitch out like crazy. Hopefully that'll be fixed with patches. The tank sounds are terrible, the engine revving is just a 2 second sound-loop. Going up a hill slows that same sound into a 4 second sound-loop. Pretty much every sound the tank makes is just a clip looped over and over. The Tanks are way too OVERPOWERED. They're often not enough tanks to go around, so when you go on foot, you're done in a single hit. There is NO WAY for infintry to take out a tank either. That's total bullocks.\n\nBattle- The only mode worth playing. That's all I'll say.\n\nCarnage- It's garbage. You just flick your shovel at enemies and it's... Oh so boring and tedious.\n\nThe rest of the modes I've yet to try out, I'll edit the review when I try them out soon.\n\nRender Distance:\nThe render distance is attrocious. Apparently "Far" means a couple of feet in front of you. Come on, render distance shouldn't be a thing that can be altered. People with slower PCs won't be able to see very far and faster PCs will see an enemy across the world, and that is why the "Far" setting isn't far at all.\n\nPay Model:\nIt doesn't annoy me that you pretty much have no additional weapons past the ones you start off with and the only way to buy anything is to use real money. What bothers me is that the terrible balance of the free weapons aren't fixed with the premium weapons. This game generally has horrible balance.\n\nBLOCKADE 3D is an unbalanced, uninspired, ugly, buggy, laggy, mess of a game. I'd say this game has some good ideas if it weren't that 10 games and mods haven't done this before it. This whole "Minecraft as an FPS" has been done to death and it's getting old. It's a blatent cash-grab towards the Minecraft fan-kids and nothing more. Is it worth your time? No.","December 22, 2014","false","5.1"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

I would say more about the game, but the rest of the reviews essentially have said all there is to say about it. I have not seen, however, many reviews about the devs, so listen to this: the game originally released on\nNov 5, 2014 . If you are observant you can see that this game is in early access. Now check this out: if you look at the "What the developers have to say" section in the early acess part, you will see this:\nApproximately how long will this game be in Early Access?                                                                  “4-6 months.”\nAs of writing this, the date is  Feb 15, 2016 . So I'm gonna go out on a limb and say they are never really gonna work on this game to get it past it's current state. This means they just have this sitting as a rock at the bottom of the pond that is steam, accumulating just enough money from children with credit cards to keep it alive.\n\nIf you want a block-related shooter that is free with no microtransactions, you can find one here, called openspades:\nhttps://github.com/yvt/openspades/releases/tag/v0.0.11\nIt is actually a clone of the now-unavalible inspiration for Ace Of Spades on steam. In my opinion, while it isn't excellent, it is still better than Ace Of Spades on steam, and it doesn't cost money. In conclusion, BLOCKADE 3D is an awful game that flat-out does not function, Openspades is pretty okay.","February 15","false","0.2"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","22","30","2","0"

To start off one big thing about the game I dont like is there is lots and i mean lots of spawn killing, normally I could deal with it but not when some guy that has 100hr in the game comes and spawn camps my spawn. Another reason why I really dont like it is because it has alot of pay to win players, but I guess thats what you get when the game is nothing but pay to win, the bigest way they steal your money though is the vip or what ever its called. It costs about $1.99 a week to be vip. One other reason why I dont care for the game is the leveling up. You littearly have to sit for hours to level up, and for me I had about 14 hours on it and I only was on level 5 by the end of all of it, after each level you don't get much either, maybe some explosives but rarely any weapones (also the explosives are limited and you have to level up to restalk).

My first impression of this game was that it was a Ace of Spades clone but free! While the orginal Ace of Spades was great (aside from hackers) this game just....sucks. First problem I have with this game is that the resoultion was really tiny. I tried to change it, but the settings won't save for some bizarre reason, so I have to play this game on a tiny little window. Great. The menu is okay, but I have no idea what is going on! There isn't even a tutorial or anything to help new players get started! So I join a server and start playing.... and get spawn camped. Really? No "safe" spawn ground? I know this game is early in development, but they could at least make the spawn building secure so I don't get spawn camped every time respawn! The game ran great for me, with little to no lag and the graphics are okay, I guess... There is no sense of progression and the leveling system is bare bones and doesn't even seem to work for me at all. Also, all of the weapons, skins, and cool stuff is all locked behind a HUGE paywall. If there is no leveling system, no way to purchase guns without emptying your wallet and it makes you just want to play the old, free version of Ace of Spades, then I don't see any reason why you should invest your time in this game. I know it is still in early development, but this game has left a bad impression on me.\n","December 22, 2014","false","0.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Added the fact the fact that the the creators of the game did make an area to report them they still don’t do anything about it. Most of their fan base has left the game because of this and that’s way it’s still am early access game. The “Pay to play, Pay to win” aspect is annoying because you can’t get anywhere without buying an overly expensive gun. With the fact that they removed American servers making it harder on American players with high ping, lag and other server problems .Only play this game if you have deep wallets and live in either Europe or Russia.

You can't directly buy everything as a lvl 1, you have to level up and then you can spend your money on things. Real life money of course.Yep,its p2w.\n\nGameplayThis game is the base game for another game which lacks knockback and bulletspread on weapons. These are thing for a reason,to not be able to snipe people with a fricking minigun over a larger distance.\nThis game is a tidious grindfest where you have to play hours to get 1 level, and don't think about making privat rooms,because you need Premium for it.\nOverallIf you want to play a minecraft like game with guns just go back get minecraft instead and look for a gunmod- There are many. You will probably have more fun in that game then in this piece of ♥♥♥♥ anyways. Spending money on this game,to confirm the information,gives you a huge advantage over others. Sure the stuff you can get for free might be good,but the stuff you can buy with irl money is still better. Just a shame that every dollar earned with this game goes straight into the servers,he should do what any sane scammer does:run away with the money and shut down the servers after a while.Would probably for the best anyways.\nI cannot recommend a game like this, and im suprised that trash like this even has a fairly mixed rating,considering what other game this guy made.(he literally made a minecraft clone. its not completly the same but worse(that is for a different review however) .\nThe uninstall button is free through.\nIf you excuse me now, I will be bashing my head against the wall to forget that this game even exists.","April 9","false","28.5"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","14","20","6","0"

At first: the graphics. The graphics made me puke, this game is so ugly. Ace Of Spades (which i hate) looks over 9000 times better. Well, this game is pure PAY2WIN. It made me laugh 'cause if you play for free you have 3 weapons. The other weapons (like RPG which kills with 1 hit...) cost real money so the rich kids can buy RPG's, ruin the map and kill us by one hit. The building in this game is a joke. Every time i wanted to build something like a sniper tower or a bunker i got shot in my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ head. Everyone plays snipers because the free sniper rifle (it looks like WW2 one) kills with one hit (ofc it has no scope, you may buy the one with scope). The community is (this game is made of blocks so yeah) awful. Russians spammers (oh really), kids (oh really) and the rich kids (oh really). I got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that whenever i respawned i got killed by RPG or by a headshot. This game has like 5 types of gameplay (zombies, tanks, capture, battle and the other ones which i don't remember) but they all are bugged AF. The tanks mode is a joke, it's so bugged (ofc you can buy a better tank with ur parents $$$). I can say a lot more why this game sucks but there is a good reason why to play it - it's free so you lose only (ONLY) your precious time. The gameplay is really simple but the community ruins it. I don't recommend this "game" (duh).","December 30, 2014","false","0.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

AS this is an early access game it can get better (but i don't think it will)\n\nI've played this game for 11 minutes and I'm sorry to say this but this is the worst game I've ever played (btw i dont play that many games doh).\n\nPros:\n-I guess it's not a big download\n-The uninstall button\n\nCons:\n-To kill it's either one headshot with the sniper or 20 bodyshots with the SMG\n-Buying guns with your parents money is the only way to win\n-Early Access\n-One death noise and animation\n-Pay to win\n-MICROTRANSACTIONS\n-The building aspect of this game is useless. People only use it to build bridges which didn't need to be there if the developer made the maps good\n-Russian servers are the only good ones in the game\n-Zombies don't respawn in the zombie mode meaning that it's like 5 zombies vs 5 people with guns instead of an overwhelming heard of zombies\n-Pro tip: if you aim the gun 2 blocks high instant headshots\n-Hackers are everywhere.\n\nFinal Verdict: Don't play this game. It is soooooooo bad. Play better FREE games like tf2 or planetside 2 or BARBIE DRESSUP anything is better than this.

But, there could be REALLY HUGE LAG SPIKES. (As I almost had to force quit the game.)\nI somewhat agree with the physics and nature of the weapons. 1 shot to the head with the M3 shotgun/ M14 = death. A few bullets and shots to the chest= death. MP5= give or take 10 shots to the chest = death. A few shots to the head = death.\n\nThe HUUGE problem I have with this game is the selling of weapons. (Pay2win as its called) EVERYTHING IS OVERPRICED. Want a good assault rifle? Pay $3.00 and it's yours. Want a sniper? Too bad, cough up $2.50 and it's yours. Everything should be reasonably priced at $.10 - $1.00. (Some things can be a bit more priced but that's what i'd put a price on micro-transactions like these.)\n\nBugs... There were a few bugs. Not too much of a problem but, there are a few.\n\nYou cannot make a private server with friends... BUMMER MAN...\n\n32 players... Wish it could be 64 players.\n\nServers are not placed for certain continents (North America, South America, Europe, etc.) It's all mixed around.\n\nI can't say much about the game as it is in a "Early Access." If they add, and fix these problems, I could say to you that this is a great game. But for now, I don't. If you're a casual gamer who just doesn't care about weapons and XP, and only cares about the LAG that's in the game, then you should *at least* try it. But, if you want the full experience, don't bother playing.\n\nIf this game does fix the many issues it has, I'll try the game again. I'll even recommend it to all my friends.

There are games that are even more p2w than this that I've played, *cough* a lot of mmos, *cough* and yet, I see more complaints on this game about it. This game is, from what I've found, made by one person who clearly doesn't have a lot of money to be spending on development of this game. So, yes, they need some way of getting enough money to host it in the first place. It's completely different than what MMOs are doing nowadays. Most MMOs can host their servers without being payed from outside sources, but that money goes to development.\n\nAs of now, all the money spent in this game goes to hosting, meaning there isn't a budget for development of this. That's why the game is as bad as other says. I wouldn't recommend it as of now, but if the dev ever gets enough money to enhance the gameplay features and crack down on the hackers, I would gladly recommend it. As of now, I consider this game an alpha build. But that's just what I see from it.","March 21","false","15.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

But the people who decide to buy stuff ruin the game. I don't recomend this game because the cash bought weapons and armor are overpowered. In this game, there are one-shot-kill headshots. But you can prevent it by getting a helmet, or armor.\nPros: Fast-paced, Building, Ragdolls, Sniping, and much more.\nCons: Micro-transactions, sometimes to big or small maps, no team balance, no recoil, really low health.\nTips: If you decide to get this game, be ready to see younger players. This game has minecraft based graphics, which invite young to play. Sometimes people will buy weapons or armor, which helps turn the tide. If you are in a group thats losing, don't switch teams. People will be wanting to win, so they change teams. There is no auto-balance.\nBugs: random lag/ crashes (might be my problem), fullscreen doesn't work.\nWARNING TO ALL SNIPER LOVERS: THIS GAME START WITH A SNIPER, BUT HAS NO SCOPE.","December 20, 2014","false","13.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After a few minutes of looking through games and apps you'll usually find one of these shovelware games aka "minecraft shooters". They are rushed, unbalanced, and are pay2win. The demo they aim for is 6 year old minecraft lovers who cant afford 20$ to buy the actual thing. That's all fine and dandy but THEY DONT BELONG ON THE PC\n\nGameplay:\nClunky and horrible, nothing more. If you want to enjoy this game, get ready to dish out 30$+ to buy competent weapons. And the weapons... oh god.. The M14 is the best free weapon in the game. 1shot to the head is a kill, and with the heads being oh, i don't know.. SUPER FREAKING HUGE, it's almost impossible to miss. the M3 sucks, and takes multiple hits to kill. the MP5 is just garbage. To enjoy this game, you need to pay for weapons.\nThey have several modes, which i've played all except one. I couldnt get a good enough server to play it.\n* Deathmatch:  the only good mode, basic fps.\n* Zombies: Infection, zombies take multiple hits to kill, (unloaded a full M3 on one), one zombie hit will infect you, though it seems if a zombie comes within a 3 mile radius of you, you become infected.\n* Tank:  Nice concept, just deathmatch with tanks.... if the tanks were actually playable. I'm assuming this will be fixed soon, but its almost IMPOSSIBLE to drive, and if you want to shoot and *gasp* actually kill someone, you have to have the patience of a Tibetan monk.\n*Capture: CTF, what more do you want, though it seems it's impossible to win due to the guns being op.\n*Carnage: Just hit each other with shovels. great..\nEvery server except for russian ones are laggy. Your character seems to jump back and forth with every step.\n\n\nGraphics:\nMix between roblox and minecraft... this game doesn't even know what it wants to rip off. no sounds except guns and explosions. The tank sounds like a car.\n\n\nThe Good:\nThe uninstall button works just fine.\n\nThe Bad:\nEverything. Especially the leveling system. It's broken as all hell. It seems impossible to level up.\n\nOverall grade = D+\nYes, i'm going to get hate for rashing on an game in EARLY ACCESS, but games like these don't belong on the PC. If you want a minecraft-esque shooter, i'd suggest buying Minecraft and downloading mods.","January 18, 2015","false","0.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Also, if this game had a reliable anti cheat system, 2/3 of their players would be gone.\n\nConclusion:\nParents - If you are wondering where your PayPal money keeps on going and want to save hundreds of dollars a year, kick that little ♥♥♥♥ out of your house.\n\nThis game may be free, but time is something you will never get back.","March 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","5","8","5","0"

Premium guns destroy the ingame crap. Its like comparing a bb gun to a watermelon. Oh at level 6 you get the AUG, its so much better. So in order to enjoy the game i either have to pay money, or get owned and owned and owend until i get to level 6. It takes so many shots to kill someone with these free guns but the prem guns drop you faster than i can blink. If you want to play a game like this go download build and shoot. Its free with no paying at all, theres only 3 guns in the game and you can customize your own sights and skins.

However, when these issues aren't too prominent the game is fun.\n\nYeah, I had a review before that said that this game wasn't pay to win and was actually good.\n\nNeedless to say, I pulled that because that was not correct. I really wanted this game to be good, but I can't honestly say it is.\n\nIt's pay to win\nNon-paying players cannot get helmets or armor, which gives an unfair advantage to paying players. Having played both with and without armor, I can honestly say that I got a better K:D ratio with armor on. Also, I bought a high-capacity gun, giving more of a noticable advantage. Finally, though I did not buy this, you can pay for a "premium" account (which is a subscription). This gives you double experience. Again, I did not buy this but this is how it is advertised and is stated by other players.\n\nThe community is terrible\nThis isn't something I usually like to say is bad about a game, but it's pretty terrible. I've argued with BeastX, the top #1 player. He heavily insisted that the game was not pay to win, despite the fact he actually stated it was pay to win (he stated that the game gave an advantage to paying players). Also, he calls those who don't want to pay "poor kids." Keep in mind that this is exactly how the majority of the community thinks and acts. They reject those that talk badly of the game, saying that they are bad or poor.\n\nAlso, I've been called racist terms and have been in a server when someone started chanting "F*** AMERICA." The non-American portion of the community can be quite hostile towards Americans.\n\nHowever, it is still a bit fun\nWhen the previously mentioned issues aren't being particually bothersome, the game is fun. I've gotten good kill sprees and the game is, on paper, entertaining. Remove the cash shop, get a better community, and reduce the fog (seriously, the fog is stupidly close), the game would be very good.\n\nStill, I cannot honestly set the review as a recommend. The fact is that the two issues I mentioned are far too prominent.","January 20, 2015","false","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has many different gamemodes you can play and tons of servers to choose from. You can also get many great guns from leveling up. Now,  before you go and call this game "pay2win" or crap, hear me out. People call this game "pay2win" because you can buy all the guns, armor, rockets, etc. What people don't know is, you get the TMP, AK47, SVD, RPK (I beleieve these are all of them). The RPK and SVD are VERY strong guns. As for armor, it only gives a SMALL boost. The hat only blocks 1 round from any gun. Now you may say, for snipers it makes it two shots. True, but an AR chews through the hat. For body armor, it only blocks a few rounds. Out smart the other player and flank them. For people saying this game is laggy and full of hackers, it is, but the update is coming out this week. The anticheat will be fixed causes the hackers and the lag to go away. This will allow MANY new players to have a fun time playing. If you have called them game bad, try the game out again after the update.","March 12, 2015","true","285.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","5","10","3","4"

The game is Pay 2 Win. So if you aren't looking to spend a few Bucks, you will rage a lot.\nBUT if you do, the game makes you feel like a BAWS!\nALSO, I will be mostly talking about the "Battle" mode, the "normal" gamemode here in Blockade. I will not say much about the other gamemodes.\n\nSo, you can describe this game as an Ace of Spades clone, but free and with a progression system. And it's easy. Like,seriously easy. Even without paying and with the starter weapons,you can dominate like hell. Giant heads make headshots easy, and the missing recoil doesn't make it any harder. Also, most kids that play this came here because it looks like Minecraft with guns (once again) and they simply can't afford Ace of Spades, which leads to the community being pretty much kids with no skill that will insult you as a hacker.\n\nNow to the best gamemode, Battle!There are four teams, and each tries to claim the Blue Square in the middle. Sounds easy? Well,no. The Voxel based Maps are more complex that you'd think. There are a crap ton of tactics to get to the objective and keep the other teams from doing it, and, if done right, are damn satisfying.\nYou can destroy bridges, dig tunnels, make your own bridges, set up sniped outposts and checkpoints etc. The MOST satisfying thing tough is,when you destroy all the blocks that keep a building in the air,making for example a whole skyscraper hit the ground and destroying a major sniping place for the enemy.\n\nHAX?!The good part: I can answer this question with one simple word: No.\nEven tough you  may read a lot of "Moooom this game is full of hacker! ;_;" reviews, I can ensure you that that's not true. The Anti-Cheat system does a pretty good job at keeping hackers away from here. I have only encountered three hackers in my entire time on Blockade.\nThe bad part: The truth is much scarier...\nIt's the Payers. Or, as they like to call themselves, "5UP0R 1337 PL4YA5".\nFancy skins, body armor and OP weapons. You will be meeting a lot of them as you play this game, and it really does look like they have some sort of aimbot. Trust me,it's not. As I said, the game is really easy because of the big heads and good weapons. How I know? I am one of them. I paid 5 bucks for this game, and I enjoy it a crap ton.\nSo yeah, once you pay a bit it really depends on skill. 2 Players with Body Armor and RPK have to be really prescise as every shot counts. Any "filthy F2P peasant" trying to interrupt doesn't stand a chance and is pretty much instantly killed.\n\nSo?\nIf you happen to be in a match without any Payers, you will have a good time and it's a crap ton of fun with friends even if there are some.\nObviously, if you try to make a base in this game,it won't work out too well. This is not a game to make big castles or such as there are a crap ton of Pyromaniacs in this game.\n\nI would give blockade a solid 7/10 Points if you don't want to pay.\n\nIf you DO want to pay, then it's a clean 8/10 points.","May 24, 2015","true","60.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","1"

Nothing else. It have great future IMHO and I would like to support it.\nPROS:\n+ Addictive gameplay\n+ Funny ragdoll\n+ Not very "tryhard" type of game\n+ Alot of players\n+ Building AND destroying\n+ Its like a bit cheaper version of AOS (we will see if something will change)\n\nCONS:\n- No virtual curency. You cannot buy anything with virtual money as there are NO virtual money.\n- Items that can be bought ONLY with real money.\n- Armors which slightly protect you from damage (Also bought with real money)\n- Weird tank control.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- Lots, LOTS of Russians.\n\nAllright everything is here. Let me explain some of them.\nProlly when you saw P2W in reviews, you automatically marked this game as unplayable, or crap. Truth is, this P2W thing is not that horrible. Guns cost somewhere around 1 euro (THEY ARE PERMANENT!) and there is ALOT of them.\n---------------------------\nBack in the reviews I also saw people complaining about leveling. "Omfg this game wants you to sit and play 12314 hours to get 2 lvl", Disagreed.\nBefoure I bought premium, I got my 2 level after 10 minutes of gameplay. 10 minutes. Of course, guns in shop are from levels 10-20 but if you dont want to sink into that game for more, you are not going to achieve that high level. You have to enjoy it. Not grind it.\n---------------------------\nGraphics. Yes, ffs we are here.\nALOT of complains about graphics. Well, there are 2 types of games. Those 3D, beautifuly rounded and modelled like Butterfield or Crap of Duty. And those 3D, blocky games like Minecraft or, yep, BLOCKADE. If you complain about graphics, not gameplay, then please turn around, open the door, and get out of here.\n\nIf I forgot about something and you want me to rate it, just comment my review. I will read them. That was my whole review.\n\nGIVE THIS GAME A TRY ; - )\n\n","January 19, 2015","true","7.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","4","8","4","2"

It has many different gamemodes you can play and tons of servers to choose from. You can also get many great guns from leveling up. Now,  before you go and call this game "pay2win" or crap, hear me out. People call this game "pay2win" because you can buy all the guns, armor, rockets, etc. What people don't know is, you get the TMP, AK47, SVD, RPK (I beleieve these are all of them). The RPK and SVD are VERY strong guns. As for armor, it only gives a SMALL boost. The hat only blocks 1 round from any gun. Now you may say, for snipers it makes it two shots. True, but an AR chews through the hat. For body armor, it only blocks a few rounds. Out smart the other player and flank them. For people saying this game is laggy and full of hackers, it is, but the update is coming out this week. The anticheat will be fixed causes the hackers and the lag to go away. This will allow MANY new players to have a fun time playing. If you have called them game bad, try the game out again after the update.","March 12, 2015","true","285.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","5","10","3","4"

Alot of people in thier reviews complain that this is a P2W (Pay to Win) game. Upon leveling up you unlock weapons. There are alot of stuff you can buy in the shop, some are OP and others arent.\n\nGame is in the early stages, no Anti-Cheat system in place which means there are a lot of people who are using cheats. At this stage It may not be worth playing for people because of the cheaters, I think when a system comes in place that people will like it alot more. Another thing about this game is that the physics are not all there. There is no recoil, no gravity on your bullets (you can shoot a LMG across map and get instant headshots).\n\nThe biggest thing that bugs me about this game is the helmet. It advertises that helmets provide 1-hit protection to the head. Some snipers bypass this and still kill you with 1 shot to the head.\n\nThis game is fun, but to make it fun you have to set aside the cheap shots that players can get on you across map.","January 16, 2015","true","29.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The graphics are on par with top tier games like Bad Rats, Unturned and Minecraft. It has all of the elements that a core shooter needs. Like guns. You can even get a shovel! And puts some guns like the L96A1 at a cheap price of around $3. Bargain! It only takes about 50 hours of full gametime to get a better gun, which still sucks, but you could just buy it for real money, which, lets be honest, would be money well spent.\nIt also looks a bit like Minecraft so you can't go wrong i guess. All around a great game that i would recommend for anyone who gets bullied and is looking to kill themselves. The memes are very fresh and the zombie mode is super sp00ky.\nOnce you get past the Russians it is a sensitive little boy that really wants to play with the other kids but is autisitic and can't because they make fun of him. As he cuts himself he wonders about a game that could be worse than his autism, and Blockade 3D was born. Honestly can't wait till the sequel, BLOCKADE 4D, the hype is real.\nI want my life back/10","April 18, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

However, when these issues aren't too prominent the game is fun.\n\nYeah, I had a review before that said that this game wasn't pay to win and was actually good.\n\nNeedless to say, I pulled that because that was not correct. I really wanted this game to be good, but I can't honestly say it is.\n\nIt's pay to win\nNon-paying players cannot get helmets or armor, which gives an unfair advantage to paying players. Having played both with and without armor, I can honestly say that I got a better K:D ratio with armor on. Also, I bought a high-capacity gun, giving more of a noticable advantage. Finally, though I did not buy this, you can pay for a "premium" account (which is a subscription). This gives you double experience. Again, I did not buy this but this is how it is advertised and is stated by other players.\n\nThe community is terrible\nThis isn't something I usually like to say is bad about a game, but it's pretty terrible. I've argued with BeastX, the top #1 player. He heavily insisted that the game was not pay to win, despite the fact he actually stated it was pay to win (he stated that the game gave an advantage to paying players). Also, he calls those who don't want to pay "poor kids." Keep in mind that this is exactly how the majority of the community thinks and acts. They reject those that talk badly of the game, saying that they are bad or poor.\n\nAlso, I've been called racist terms and have been in a server when someone started chanting "F*** AMERICA." The non-American portion of the community can be quite hostile towards Americans.\n\nHowever, it is still a bit fun\nWhen the previously mentioned issues aren't being particually bothersome, the game is fun. I've gotten good kill sprees and the game is, on paper, entertaining. Remove the cash shop, get a better community, and reduce the fog (seriously, the fog is stupidly close), the game would be very good.\n\nStill, I cannot honestly set the review as a recommend. The fact is that the two issues I mentioned are far too prominent.","January 20, 2015","false","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Third I have tons of fun playing this with my friends, most of the ime i spent on this game was playing a bunch of different game modes with my friends on skype. Of course the game copies cod and it also is some what glitchy at times but all of it isnt as bad a experience as people are making it out to be plus its free and entertaining even with its problems. Over all looking at other peoples reviews most of the things are true, the only thing I dont agree with is the claim of lag problems. I for one recommend this game it is entertaining for different reasons, so OVER ALL i give this game a 6.5 and i recommend this game to anyone who wants to have free fun","December 26, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Complaining about CS:GO and TF2 hitboxes? Play this! It's way easier to do them fast-action shooting thingy in this one-of-a-kind game! Plus, the game supports a good community, who shows you what to do, and what you can do. Very nice! It also supports 3D glasses, which of course, is good for players like me. They also have VR support! This is the only F2P FPS game which supports BETTER Virtual Reality mode than any other crappy game out there! You'll have a smile on your face when you play this!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Real Translation)\n\nThe worst ♥♥♥♥ing game in the whole ♥♥♥♥ing century. Got called a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hacker. Disgrace on the community. And guess what? This game taught me the following!\n\n- Scrape your balls to a sack of nails and rusty metal\n- Make your balls shake with a sharp tuna can\n- Sack your head on a bag filled with worms\n- Have s*x with two men\n- Get laid with a lot of Russians\n- Seriously, a Sniper without a ♥♥♥♥ING scope!\n- Hear the lyrics, "I see you driving downtown with your mom's card on, and like, ♥♥♥♥ ME..."\n- Geez, don't waste money on a game you would consider as Minecraft\n- Ripping off is good, yes?\n- Walls will ♥♥♥♥ you every time\n- I would like to sew my ballsack all over again\n\n\nSave your life from cancer, please.","December 14, 2015","true","1.0"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","49","28","57","23","0"

I don't know why people hate this game so much, But to me, its fun.\n\nHere are some pros and cons about this game:\n\nPros:\nFairly fun gameplay.\nThe game has Great Customizations to your character. (Guns, Knifes, etc...)\nThe shops prices are fair.\nVariety of different maps, most of them are fun.\n\nCons:\nP2W players can ruin the fun for F2P players.\nThe graphics are not as appealing.\nThe physics are not as good.\nIt's a ripoff of Ace of Spades.\n\nThis game is not good, But it's ok. I was not having much fun when i was a F2P player. But once i bought some stuff from the shop, I was nearly impossible to kill. Mainly because i had a HELMETPLUS and a VESTPLUS to protect myself. Basically this means i'm a P2W player, and the F2P players are not having as much fun because of me. The HELMETPLUS and the VESTPLUS are considered the most powerful items in the game, because they offer defense. At the start of playing this game, you have no defense. Many F2P players HATE these items because they think it's unfair to them.\n\nTo be honest, I agree. But what matters is that i am having fun with everyone, and i'm having fun playing this game. Even though it's a bit P2W, its a great experience for me, and it could be a great experience for you.\n\nOverall Rating: 6.5/10","May 10, 2015","true","15.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"

I am a lvl 21 and I recommend this game. This game is amazing and it is the most easiest game to play, slappybird223 is right as well. most people who complain are not even to a rank to earn weapons. It is a a mix of a pay-to-win but you can earn weapons as well so just hang in there! I never spend any money in a game so much until i was a level 7 and my first gun that i earned was the AUG and which it is OP (overpowered) and is the best gun to get at a young level. Yes you may come across some hot heads that they think that they are hot ♥♥♥♥ because they can get 300 kills with out dying 30 times, but there are other servers you can choose through. Dont beat yourself up because you cant get a kill, with the starter guns it is hard but dont worry it will get easier once you have a feel for this game. If you dont like this game then that is alright! There is many other great games out on steam! Anyways I hope that you liked my Opinion on the game and feel free to add me on steam! If you have a question please msg (message) me anytime when i am online! Have a great day!","May 31, 2015","true","245.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","3"

I've played for about an hour or so and at it's core this game is very fun to play. First game I went 136-23. It's pretty easy and it was fun stomping scrubs with loads of nondefault weapons. You also get grenades and rockets and weapons for free from leveling up, I'll admit the dollar weapon here and 2 dollars there ♥♥♥♥ seems pretty sketchy and I suggest they allow us to buy grenades and rockets and stuff with in game money. Pretty sure you unlock the body armor at a certain level too.. Anyways, they pretty much screwed up the microtransactions but for me not having spent any money on it I had quite a bit of fun with it.\n\nYeah, that's right I was entertained.. FOR FREE\n\nIn conclusion, allow everything to be bought with ingame tokens of some kind and it would be solid. How it is right now is pretty lame but they gotta make money I guess!\n\nWhere do I put my epic 'uninstalled xDDD' copy paste in this review?!

I went all the way up to level 6 and was in the lead in almost every single match, and I didn't spend a cent. Only after I reached level 6 I treated myself to some extra gear for $8.\nThis game is great! Once you get the hang of headshots, you can win every match with the standard rifle. You do have the occasional kid who gets on everybody's nerves, but I like to solve that problem with a grenade. Playing with a friend also makes the game much more fun.\nSo yes, I do recommend this game. Just beware that there are some pretty good, fair playing, players out there; you will need to be a good First-Person-Shooter shooter!","September 6, 2015","true","63.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

Its an ok shooter but almost everything costs real money. They give out some free stuff in earlier ranks. Like a rocket launcher with expendable ammo(The ammo stays the same throughout games except for primary guns). If you don't like generic first person shooters with minecraft like mechanics, than don't get. Honestly, to me, it should be less than free! (Obviously thats not a thing but just roll with it). the least they could have done with this is make it an option to pay for guns, but there is in-game currency to help kind of balance it out. I always play P2W games but I always play for free. Of course that limits me a lot, but I deal with it. But this... this... its just... terrible...terrible terrible.","December 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
