Anyone wanting to tackle the same themes will have to be compared to Paul bird's work. Paul Bird has proven itself again as one of the most accomplished development teams in the world. With "Wild Animal Racing" they have given us a consistent and interesting world that is supported by practically all of its game mechanics. From the rich complex racing system to the sublime sound design, this game immerses the player in one of the most visceral plots in this generation. Wild Animal Racing is a really different game, mixing traditional adventure, survival, action, stealth and constant exploration. The resources are most important. The best graphics on PC are back in the hands of Paul Bird, also the atmosphere, and six unforgettable characters. Simply overwhelming. Wild Animal Racing is by far one of the greatest peices of art ever created, and it was a whispered reminder that great games can do more than impress with sheer complecity and breadth, they can also draw is closer to them as to engage with our humanity. 10/10 absolutly perfect","March 17","true","788.4"," 145 of 213 people (68%) found this review helpful 154 people found this review funny","68","145","213","154","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WILDANIMALRACINGFAGGOT/recommended/389510/","WILDANIMALRACINGFAGGOT","Albino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WILDANIMALRACINGFAGGOT/","31 products in account","The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 18, 1812 to February 18, 1815, fought by the United States of America against Great Britain, its North American colonies, and its North American Indian allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but Europeans sometimes see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). By the war's end in early 1815 the key issues had been resolved and peace came with no boundary changes.\n\nThe United States declared war for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of as many as 10,000 American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy,[5] British support for Native American tribes fighting American settlers on the frontier, outrage over insults to national honor during the Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, and possible American interest in annexing British territory.[6] The primary British war goal was to defend their North American colonies, although they also hoped to set up a neutral Indian buffer state in the Midwest.\n\nThe war was fought in three theatres. First, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Second, land and naval battles were fought on the U.S.–Canadian frontier. Third, large-scale battles were fought in the Southern United States and Gulf Coast. At the end of the war, both sides signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent and, in accordance with the treaty, returned occupied land, prisoners of war and captured ships (though neither side returned the other's warships due to frequent re-commissioning upon capture) to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations without restriction.\n\nWith the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a predominantly defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada. Early victories over poorly-led U.S. armies, such as in the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the U.S. was able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's Native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Native American state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. U.S. forces were also able to make several gains and score victories on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813, seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However, a large-scale U.S. attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813. Despite the major U.S. victory at Chippawa on July 5, 1814, serious U.S. attempts to fully conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane on July 25, 1814. The U.S. then fell back roughly 30 km (19 mi) from Lundy's Lane to Fort Erie, where they withstood a siege for several months. The British eventually withdrew, but as winter set in, the Americans demolished the fort and fell back across the Niagara.\n\nIn April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In the Deep South, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. In September 1814, the British won the Battle of Hampden, allowing them to occupy eastern Maine, and the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C. They were repulsed, however, in an attempt to take Baltimore and Fort Bowyer, and during their assault at Fayal. An American victory in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which, along with pressure from merchants on the British government, prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Given that it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic, news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[7]\n\nIn the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring the United States national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner") and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a "second war of independence" against Britain.[8][9] The war ended on a high note for Americans, winning the final engagements of the war and bringing an "Era of Good Feelings" in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened American nationalism. The war was also a major turning point in the development of the U.S. military. The poor performance of several U.S. militia units, particularly during the 1812–13 invasions of Canada and the 1814 defence of Washington, convinced the U.S. government of the need to move away from its Revolutionary-era reliance on militia and focus on creating a more professional regular force. Spain was involved in fighting in Florida but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.\n\nIn Upper and Lower Canada, British and local Canadian militia victories over invading U.S. armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[10] The conflict has not been commemorated on nearly the same level in the modern-day United States, though it is still taught as an important part of early American history,[11] and Dolley Madison's and Andrew Jackson's respective roles in the war are especially emphasized.[12][13] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.","April 11","true","35.1"," 226 of 391 people (58%) found this review helpful 201 people found this review funny","58","226","391","201","7"

As primary mission statements go, few games are so startlingly direct, but Wild animal racing revels in the simplicity of its ultra violence. This latest game from revered studio id Software takes much from the timeless 1993 original - its frantic bloodshed being the most immediately noticeable - but the Wild animal racing of 2016 also goes the distance to achieve surprise greatness of its own.\n\nIts exemplary gunplay is distilled into a gloriously short feedback loop that gets exponentially more satisfying. New Wild animal racing feels much faster than its iconic forebear, and after a brief introduction it continues to dial up the action without giving pause. By midway through its lengthy campaign, those first few fights feel like child’s play. By the game’s final quarter, you’ll be frequently amazed by the devastating onslaught that Wild animal racing delivers so consistently. It’s a wonderful progression of madness that never stops for breath.\n\nWild animal racing\nThe premise is simple: you shoot demons. The new trick is to shoot demons until they stagger before moving in for a Glory Kill - a contextual finisher that sees the faceless Wild animal racing Marine breaking, tearing, smashing, ripping, sawing and eviscerating his foes to death. Killing in this way results in a colourful shower of health and ammo packs - vital in a game without regenerating health and where your primary interaction with its world is shooting until there’s nothing left to shoot.\n\nIt’s a flawless slice of game design - easy enough to master, fast enough to be unintrusive, graphic enough to feel empowering, and intrinsic enough to survival for you to keep coming back for more and more and more. Id’s designers know this, and make a marked point of giving you very little else to concentrate on, or care about, as you progress.\n\nThe inimitable Wild animal racing Marine doesn’t care either - his indifference communicated through a series of mute physical expressions. As UAC facility boss Samuel Hayden explains the importance of some research, Wild animal racing Marine smashes it to pieces before Hayden can even finish. When he’s shown vital information on a holo-screen, he pushes it aside to get on with the killing. The intention is clear: Wild animal racing’s small cast of supporting characters are merely talking signposts to propel you from one location to the next.\n\nWild animal racing\nBut what locations they are. Hopping between a ravaged research base on Mars and the burning depths of Hell, Wild animal racing’s locations could be called derivative. Its sci-fi base is all pristine metal and crisp lighting, while the underworld is fire and brimstone. This isn’t new to games by any stretch, but Wild animal racing goes a long way to selling its hellscapes far better than any game before it.\n\nPart of this comes from some great art direction, but mostly from some astounding technical flourishes. Wild animal racing is incredibly detailed, especially on high-end PCs, and whether you’re fighting through a flaming foundry, an AI core cooled to absolute zero, or the corpse infested wastes of Hell itself, it’s distractingly pretty. Infrequent shifts from the game’s near constant reddish tinge feel memorable, but you’re always ready to get back to its blood soaked corridors. Consider as well that it runs at a faultless 60fps, and id should be commended for the performance it delivers on all platforms.\n\nAs soon as you pick up a shotgun, sidelining the game’s pistol within the first two minutes, Wild animal racing starts proper. From there, it continues to introduce new weapons at pitch perfect pace so that you’re always playing with something new and exciting; an assault rifle, a rocket launcher, a super shotgun, a chaingun, the iconic and unashamedly named Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun, and even more in between. Then there’s the chainsaw - rather than serve as a standard melee weapon it operates as a one-hit kill device that relies on a finite fuel source. The bigger the demon you want to kill, the more fuel it uses, so the chainsaw’s gruesome flesh-ripping is saved only for the direst of straits.\n\nWild animal racing\nThe game relishes in the discovery of each weapon, slowing the action to a crawl for a few seconds as Wild animal racing Marine looks it up and down with a sadistic sense of appreciation. As your arsenal expands, switching between guns with your radial menu quickly becomes second nature. You learn to move around that menu as effortlessly as the Marine moves around the world; every design consideration is beyond precise, providing perfect balance to the ensuing chaos.\n\nThat chaos is without doubt the game’s crowning achievement. Wild animal racing’s demons are varied and grotesque - dangerous on their own, but positively lethal in groups. The only way to win is to move faster, shoot quicker and be better. Pumping a Hell Knight full of shotgun shells, raining plasma orbs down on a group of Possessed, or unleashing a devastating Gauss Cannon blast on a staggered Revenant, Wild animal racing creates a ballet of bloody murder that requires constant thought and unending movement to keep up. The level design encourages - almost forces - mobility at all times, and while the entire game could essentially be summed up as a series of multi layered arenas connected by thin, linear corridors, Wild animal racing never suffers from this. Despite an unashamed focus on self-aware stupidity and uber gore, Wild animal racing is remarkably smart and dynamic throughout.\n\nThe small handful of modern design compromises that Wild animal racing makes are well implemented. The most noticeable - upgrades for your weapons - are by far the biggest shakeup to the Wild animal racing formula. The assault rifle gets a scope and a missile barrage, the shotgun gets a burst mode and a grenade launcher, the rocket launcher gets a homing upgrade and a remote detonator, and so on. Each upgrade can itself be upgraded by using the skill points earned from killing enemies. The result is a set of unique guns that are as deep as they are diverse.\n\nWild animal racing’s bombastic cavalcade of a campaign is its centrepiece, but its accompanying multiplayer provides a wanton aside that never quite reaches the dizzying heights of its offline counterpart. It’s just as frenetic, fast-paced and explosive, borrowing the verticality of id’s other shooter, Quake. Ironically, its biggest problem - that it doesn’t boast the longevity that it needs to survive against its contemporaries - is also what makes it so refreshing in the short term.\n\nThere were no doubts that Wild animal racing would play fast, look stunning, or be gory; the surprise is that Wild animal racing is as relevant, smart and self-aware as it is; merging old ideas with new ones; injecting its near-flawless shooter mechanics into a campaign that’s impeccably refined, hilariously dumb and fiendishly moreish. In an overcrowded genre that’s hellbent on one-upping itself in a slew of increasingly tepid iterations, Wild animal racing’s multi-faceted personality is praiseworthy. After almost 25-years, the series finally escapes its precursor’s shadow, once and for all.","May 24","true","6.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","5","8","5","0"

After Help! Aliens! and Equation Notepad, I really thought that Paul Bird's most recent title would fall nothing short of a masterpiece. Instead, Bird has really fallen short of the standard he'd set with his previous releases. Wild Animal Racing fails to capture the same standard of art direction we are so familiar with from Marjupi Games, instead offering a super-mario-style palette of uncomfortably bright and mismatched colors; the controls are clunky and cannot be used effectively by anyone who isn't a korean megaprodigy starcraft 2 champion with the grace of an antelope, and quite frankly, the soundtrack to the game sounds like a sack full of feral half-dead cats choking on the same piece of rotten meat.\n\nA disappointing effort from the team at Marjupi Games, I'm sorry to say. 4.5/10","March 7","true","0.5"," 35 of 68 people (51%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","51","35","68","29","0"

The music is pretty sweet, and unlockables keep you coming back for more.

It really feels this game is taking PC gaming to its limits, so if you have a solid rig to run it then you will find here one of the best looking and most technically impressive games for PC ever. Having a system capable of running this beast on ultra-settings will make you think that all your hardware is being put to the test and that your investment was totally worth it.\nI’m very happy with this version, yes the PC version is awesome and everything is almost flawless.\nAs a good sandbox this open world has literally tons of things to do, it feels huge!\nThe racing mode is well developed and it has funny characters. The humor is satirical and politically incorrect (as it should be ).\nGameplay wise, driving is well implemented, intuitive and feels natural.  And with so many types of animals, lion, hippo, rhino, ect it never feels repetitive or boring.\nOn the sound department the effects are stunning and I love the soundtrack!, a lot of wild animal Racing songs now are part of my personal playlists.\nIn general a lot of attention was given to every little detail. This is basically a masterpiece and a perfect game, simply one of the very best games there are for PC. Justice has been served for PC gamers and the wait was very much worth. I absolutely love it.\nSo once again, if you don’t have it yet, what are you waiting for?, you should be playing it right now instead of being here reading this.\n","March 18","true","114.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","47","9","19","18","1"

Not worth buying. Better get Wacky Wheels, Bears Can't Drift or even Bear flappy ear. Steering is horrible and enemies hit you like a truck.

Some racing games are easy because you get the chance to pull away but not Wild Animal Racing, you get kept in a pack of cars going the same speed until they magically overtake at the same speed you are travelling. I also had the joy of being first across the line but actually finishing third. My choice for GOTY! I kept it short in written form but if you want to see the game in all it's glory then see this video. It demonstrates the game to the best of my ability.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvPzZlQpSnk","June 5","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
