I spent a large portion of my childhood playing this, whether it was racing, force-feeding Chao or doing Mad Space hide and seeks with my cousin.\n\nAside for the obvious HD remaking, it hasn't changed. It's still that great exhilaration I remember. And now that I'm older and a much more adept gamer, I feel the need to perfect it :) halfway there already!\n\nThere are three types of stages, meaning you're three times as likely to get hooked on the game's playstyle! There are Sonic and Shadow's racing stages, obvious objective there. There are then Tails and Eggman's shooting/recon stages where you must reach the end leaving as much destruction in your wake as possible. And finally, my favourite, Knuckles and Rouge's treasure hunt stages, where you are equipped with a proximity radar which flashes a colour depending on how far you are from the gem you are trying to find. The objective is a best-of-3 gem hunt.\n\nSeriously, if you're a fan of single player campaigns with astounding replay value and games where you can spend many hours playing to perfect your score or shave milliseconds off your time, this is a high HIGH recommendation.","November 5, 2014","true","66.7"," 160 of 168 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","160","168","6","0"

Sonic Adventure 2 is a must buy for anyone who loves Sonic, or good platforming in general. A nice story told through 3 different "arcs" with fun gameplay and lots of replaybility, this game is truly one of the best Sonic games ever.\nPros:\n+40-60 hours of gameplay\n+3  diffrent types of gameplay each with fun mechanics\n+30 different enormous stages to explore (each with 5 missions to keep you playing)\n+Great soundtrack with memorable tracks (Live & Learn, City Escape, Sonic's Theme :D)\n+CHAO RAISING (onion headed mutant/animal babies racing and beating the crap out of each other!!!)\n+Secrets and hidden goodies EVERYWHERE!!!\n+Multiplayer is fun (for the most part)\nCons:\n-Repetitive and boring kart mini-game (you have to play it twice in the story, plus another 11 times in missions and mini games if you want all 180 emblem -_-)\n-Some glitches here and there\n-Lip syncing is messed up during cutscenes and voice acting sucks sometimes (Not Eggman, he sounds AWESOME :3)\n-Questionable development decisions (WHY are the bounce bracelet and light speed dash activated with the same button!!!??? Why can the radar only detect ONE emerald at a time when it could detect ALL in SA1??? >:0)\n*In conclusion. should you buy this game? ABSOLUTELY YES!!! For only $9.99 this game is definitely worth every penny!!!!

It's a fast-paced action platformer that expands on the gameplay of it's prequel. It isn't the most polished game out there and it is definitely showing its age, as it was an early 2000's title. If you like timed challenges, love racing the clock and enjoy spatial dynamics in a game then Sonic Adventure 2 is great for you. Players who prefer more abstract gameplay, dislike challenges involving physics and moving objects, or otherwise have a low affinity for platform games will not enjoy this title as much.\n\nThe port itself is a mixed bag. It supports high resolutions and the 360 controller, both of which make playing on PC a better experience. On the other hand, there are issues involving loading as the game will sometimes refuse to load if certain programs are running like flux and rainlendar (anything that uses rendered overlays). The launcher is also poorly designed.","November 25, 2013","true","50.2"," 80 of 85 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","80","85","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dorroile/recommended/213610/","dorroile","Knight-hart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dorroile/","2201 products in account","In this post-modernistic masterpiece, we follow the turbulent inner struggle of Sonic T. Hedgehog as he grapples with issues of identity, a fitting follow-up for the first game's exploration of his sexuality and search for belonging in a world he does not feel like he fits into. He is constantly besieged by a mysterious apparition known only as "The Shadow" - which, to educated players, should be immediately apparent as an overt application of Jungian psychology, as The Shadow represents the parts of Sonic that he desperately tries to not aknowledge, as well as manifesting his insecurities: where Sonic attempts to be heroic, noble, and fast, The Shadow is a cruel, villainous sort, heralding Sonic's constant inner battle against his latent nihilism and pro-capitalistic attitude, an aspect of his character that is also explored in his obsession with "Rings", the main currency of Hedgehog Earth. Worth noting is that The Shadow does not have Sonic's speed - instead opting to have his racing prowess augmented  by a pair of rocket-enhanced shoes, symbolizing Sonic's constant insecurity and fear - running is all he is good at, what if he one day could not run as quickly without aid? What use would there then be for him? He literally can not see himself as anything else than someone who runs fast, and his self-esteem suffers for it. There are some Kafka-esque overtones to this subplot, punctuated by Lynchian dream sequences in which Sonic takes on the appearance of Doctor Eggman, his therapist, as he rampages through a derelict shipyard in a large robot, freeing animals from the cold clutches of other, slightly smaller robots. These scenes are often contrasted by the non-chronological vignettes wherein we play as Tail The Hedgehog; these ultimately only exist to expand upon the backstory of Sonic's relationship with Jamie Hedgehog, however, while the Doctor Eggman scenes tend to revolve around Sonic's trust issues. There is also a minor subplot concerning Knuckles The Hedgefund, and his supposedly controversial inter-racial relationship with Rogue The Boat, but this is ultimately only inserted to make the game an appropriate length (five and a half hours) and these stages were all removed in the Director's Cut.\n\nAll in all, this is a classic that you owe it to yourself to experience. I have faith that if this game had been released before Johnny "Jaws" Ebert died, he would have realized that sometimes, video games CAN be art - SEGA's creative mastermind, director Shigeru Miyamoto, has certainly proved that much with this interesting (though thematically dense) narrative.","July 4, 2013","true","1.5"," 117 of 142 people (82%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","82","117","142","14","10"

But while the other Sonic Adventure was available for the PC at one point (2 disc version) this one came a little too late. However for those HD purists this game supports HD resolutions and fast load times. Just make sure you have an XBOX 360 Controller as this game is way too hard with the keyboard. For those people who have integrated Intel HD cards that supports pixel and vertex shading, you may have a hard time with the beginning level of the game where a certain portion of the game does not render propery (it starts with a truck going downhill) It won't happen on non intel cards however. Worth it to check it out though if it's on a sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/213610/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D Action Platformer that brings some variety and interesting setups from the traditional Sonic formula. Originally released on the Dreamcast in 2001, then ported over to the Gamecube in 2002 with some additional features, this HD version is a little remaster that came out in 2012.\n\nThe plot of the game is that Dr. Eggman is trying to take over the world, and he's doing it this time by hijacking an abandoned research facility called the Space Colony ARK. Along the way, he finds Shadow the Hedgehog, who was cryogenically frozen by Eggman's grandfather, Gerald Robotnik, 50 years ago when the ARK was in use. Gerald created Shadow aboard the ARK to make the "Ultimate Life Form", a creation that was his life goal. Shadow has a vendetta against humanity as he was friends with Gerald's daughter, Maria, who died on the ARK because she was shot by the military. Shadow believes that Maria's last wish to Shadow was to make humanity pay for her death. Eggman and Shadow work together to gather the Chaos Emeralds and have the Eclipse Cannon blow up the Earth. They're also met by Rogue the Bat, a government spy trying to find out the secret behind Shadow and who he really is. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles all try to stop this plan as they catch word of it, accompanied by Amy. Knuckles goes off on a tangent though to recover the pieces of the Master Emerald, that was shattered by Knuckles himself to prevent Eggman from taking it.\n\nThe story is rather big for a Sonic game, it has lots of setpieces and cutscenes, nothing too special though. The animations and voice acting really shows that it's dated, but the story was pretty ambitious for having such a simple premise back in the classic days. It's interesting, I'll give it that, but nothing mind blowing. It introduced Shadow and Rogue, who are now pretty popular icons in the series, so that's something.\n\n\n\n\n\nGameplay is varied, like Sonic Adventure 1, but now it's been reduced to 3 types of gameplay, and there's no hub world. Just going from stage to stage one after the other. There's the Sonic and Shadow stages where it's classic fast paced Sonic action, where you use your homing attack and speed to get to the goal ring at the end. These types of stages are the most traditional and arguably the most fun. There's lots of loops, speed sections, homing attack chains, pretty much 2D Sonic in 3D. I think you'll like them.\n\nThe Tails and Eggman stages have said characters in these robotic mechs, making the gameplay more combat oriented. You have a laser which can lock onto enemies, then you fire a barrage of missles when the trigger is released. Later on you also get some hover jets that let you glide in the air for a little while before landing. It's more platform-like than the rest of the game, and you'll be jumping around and shooting. These stages are basically a slower version of the Sonic/Shadow stages, but they're still fun. It's satisfying to lock onto 10 enemies at once, then seeing them all destoryed, earning you massive bonus points.\n\nThe Knuckles and Rogue stages have you looking for 3 pieces of the Master Emerald. This one is all about searching in one big area and getting the 3 pieces as quickly as you can. You have a little radar at the bottom of the screen that'll glow green, yellow, and red as you get closer to it. You also have these hint TVs that'll give you advice on where the current piece is. These might be the least fun to most people, and I don't blame them, it's a rather slow and odd approach for being in a Sonic game, and there isn't that much to do other than just fly around and look for stuff.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first time in the series where you're graded on your performance at the end of the stage, you can get an E, D, C, B, or A rank depending on how well you did. If you love to complete things 100% or just test your skills on how well you can do, I think you'll really like this feature, as it's included in all future installments of the series.\n\nThat brings up something else, this game has HUGE replayability. Each of the many stages has it's simple "Get to the goal" or "Find all the pieces" objective, then there's 4 other missions you can do with variations on the stage. Mission 2 is getting 100 rings, Mission 3 is finding the lost chao somewhere in the stage, Mission 4 is beating the stage under a time limit, and Mission 5 is beating the hard mode of the stage. For each mission you complete, you earn an Emblem. There are a total of 180 emblems. There's many other modes as well such as Boss Rush, Kart Racing, and multiplayer, all with their respective emblems to receive. This game will keep you busy for a long time.\n\n\n\n\nA feature many people love is the Chao Garden. You can raise your own chao in a little garden, and basically take care of him. You can pet him, feed him, play with him, all the normal stuff you'd expect. It sounds kinda weird and dumb at first, but you surprisingly get invested into it, and there is actually a LOT of stuff to do with your chao. Your chao can compete in Chao Races and Chao Karate, each having their own special rules. Your chao's performance is based entirely on his stats. Running, Flying, Power, etc. You can raise your Chao's stats by getting Chaos Drives and small animals in the missions from the story, found by destroying enemies. Raising your chao's stats to beat the hardest races and karate tournaments will take a long time, and that will also keep you busy in the game. There's even a kindergarten where you can leave your chao to learn little things like playing the drums or dancing. It's very, very in depth with much more to do, you'll just have to see for yourself.\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, Sonic Adventure 2 isn't the best game in the series, but it's real solid with it's gameplay variety, huge replayability, loads of stuff to do, and the chao garden. One of Sonic's best games, I think you'll get a kick out of it.\n\n7/10","August 11, 2015","true","51.3"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","53","57","0","0"

This port is very faithful. You need a good cpu to run it, and if you don't, you're better off emulating it.\n\nIf you don't have a sense of nostalgia for this game, the controls take getting used to, and doing the ring dash is off at times. Worse case, when you have to do a ring dash in the air as Sonic after getting the Bounce Bracelet.\n\nYou have 3 main character types. Speed (Sonic and Shadow), Shooting (Tails and Eggman), and Treasure Hunting (Knuckles and Rouge). Speed is what you expect and works just fine for the most part except what I explained a bit ago. Shooting is much slower, but pretty fun to shoot things and gain huge combos. Treasure Hunting can either go in your favor, or frustrate you, depending on your luck. All 3 have really tight control, so you can stop on a dime.\n\nWith linking to a portable device gone, the Chao system is more limited now. You can't interact with Chao from other files, Special Chao and even Maria's theme are impossible. However, with the trainer linked at the bottom, it becomes possible. It'll depend on how you feel about using something like a trainer. The rest remains the same.\n\nI very highly recommend a controller for this. It's much more difficult to control with the keyboard. With a keyboard, you can only run, never walk since a keyboard is digital and not analog. And you can never be precise with your movement. Even when I first tried a keyboard, I instantly got thrown off. Bottom line, use a 360 controller, or be like me and use a PS3 controller using the "Better DS3" tool.\n\nWhat's really cool about this PC version is the amount of mods made by fans. So anyone who misses the cheats from the previous versions, can use them here. Most of the mods are for looks, but there's Character Selection, Spin Dash for the alternate speed characters (Amy and Metal Sonic), and even a Super Sonic mod.\n\nAnother mod that is note worthy is the Chao Stat Multiplier. This increases any stat increases a Chao gets by 5 times. So for example, instead of +2, you get +10. If you ever felt getting stats up took forever, this cuts down the fat. This is also good if you don't wish to use a trainer outside of getting the Maria theme.\n\nDespite the downsides from this version and the initial game, if you can look past them, I highly recommend this game.\n\nHere are some mods.\nhttp://mm.reimuhakurei.net/?page=sa2mods (Install into the Steam SA2 folder)\nhttp://chao.tehfusion.co.uk/ (A Chao Trainer for SA:DX and SA2 on Steam) [Can also be used to get Maria Theme]","November 25, 2013","true","37.8"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","51","54","0","4"

It was quite revolutionary back then as Sonic came out in full force in 3D and the tracks were no longer linear and some freedom regarding movement was given. I will say this about the PC version though, Sega definitely betrayed their gamers by not making this game complete and by adding DLC to it (which was common core to the old game - such as 2 players local).\n\nIn Sonic Adventure 2 you may play as the "good" side with Sonic (featuring Knuckles and Tails) or the "bad" side with Shadow, Eggman and Rouge). Although six playable characters in total, all have their own unique features in the game. Sonic and Shadow have speed runs where they run through a level. Knuckles and Rouge have sort of a free roam mode where they are able to glide/fly and use their powers to achieve whatever their goal is (activate 4 beacons for example). Tails and Eggman control their robot mech's which add a sort of total destruction to the game. Each level is uniquely different and it seems they really cared about what they did when making this. Emblems and Chao's are also available to collect throughout the game. Chao's can be sort of used as power ups but are treated as pets in a separate realm in game. I should add the two player modes are absolutely awesome (especially when racing one another on foot). Some of the game modes include action race, treasure hunt race (free-roam sort of thing), mech battle mode and lastly a go-kart sort of racing feature. Some modern day gamers may become tired of playing through a story mode with such a rhythm... then again, some how people are still buying CoD.\n\nVisuals are definitely old school but are good enough to keep you interested. Some people really don't like old games as they can't wrap their head around the lack of polygons. I understand that. The game play should be good enough to keep you going. Sounds are off the charts and provide for a fun atmosphere. In the first level (playing Sonic), you will be chased by a truck. To this day, is still one thing that gives me goosebumps when playing a game.\n\nOverall, a good game and a recommended on sale. I do think Sega should include the DLC free as it is sort of putting a middle finger up to gamers.\n\n(Old school rating : 8/10)\n\n\nRATING : 7/10\n\n\n\nGameplay	B	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	C+	Sounds / Music	C+	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+\n\nScreenShots :\nKnuckles CANNOT fly but he can glide and climb up pretty much anything\n\nTails vs Dr Robotnik in their mechs\n\nI'd like to see snowboarders do this\n\nSpeed run","December 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","60","70","7","5"

(Very much like the first Sonic Adventure) Usually most people praise the gameplay sections of Sonic and Shadow for the more straightforward platforming action gameplay, but berate the clunky platform and shooting-segments from Tails/Dr. Eggman's stages, and the incredibly large and oftentimes tedious stage design of Knuckles/Rouge's treasure hunting stages. Although met with mixed reactions, Sonic Adventure 2 was overall regarded as one of the better outings SEGA's mascot has received in his 3D career.\n\nWith the game's release on Steam, I've tried this game out after I played the Gamecube port many years ago on, and personally I think it's a pretty decent port with HD graphics, a curious leaderboard system for the really hardcore fans of this game, and the 'Battle' content originally from the Gamecube port as DLC, which includes a pretty decent 2-player vs. mode and a overhaul of the main menu theme and other minor extra's.\n\nThe game's divided into 3 main gameplay modes, which you tackle as 3 characters on both the Hero and Dark side of the spectrum, complete with their own set of stages. As explained above the characters' gameplay styles are very drastically different, and most newcomers will often struggle with even finishing alot of the stages past the first few ones in the story, because of the somewhat harsh difficulty curve in the stage design. A new mechanic introduced in this game was the ranking system, in where dependant on how fast you cleared the stages and how well you overall did in your run, the higher the score, which is oftentimes easier said than done. Frequent issues were the rather clunky camera angles that shifted all over the place during gameplay, and you can't manually control the camera while moving around, alot of the enemies in Tails/Dr. Eggman's stages wold often spawn out of nowhere and collide with your character, taking a big chunk of damage and risking their high score streak, and that you can only detect one objective out of 3 at a time in the Knuckles/Rouge stages, and they usually randomize with the locations of the items, requiring you to both know the large stage layout and also collect them as quickly as possible, making A-ranking alot of the stages quite a difficult task in itself.\n\nThere's also the Chao Garden in where you can raise your virtual pet Chao, either for time-wasting fun, or to have them compete in races or karate mini-games. It's a nice  distraction and improvement from the Chao Garden system in the original game, but raising them can be very time-consuming (unless you use a in-game glitch mechanic to abuse it) and you have to remain in the actual Chao Garden to wait for your Chao to mature and grow better stats. It's a alright inclusion, but nothing I would spend time on personally.\n\nFlaws aside, Sonic Adventure 2 is still a title worth playing if you're a big fan of the blue hedgehog and it's a moderate price on the Steam Shop. Just don't expect too have a easy time on the game if you're trying to shoot for all the unlockable content in the game.","October 14, 2014","true","51.5"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","47","52","0","1"

It is just as memorable and fun as the original Sonic Adventure game, but lacks the 'small' amount of free roam it used to have. You select from two teams: Hero and Dark, from which you play as 3 characters in a sequence of missions until the end-game and final boss, which I won't talk about as I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone.\n\nI played this game when it came out on the Dreamcast, just like Sonic Adventure, and was never disappointed. It as another one of those games I could play day in and day out and holds many memories for me. You are assigned a grade for each level, E, D, C, B and A - A being the best. There are 5 stages to each level with a different objective so that you won't be left with nothing to do. Unless your a pro like me of course;) Ahem, anyways...\n\nOnce all stages are complete with Hero and Dark stories, you unlock a final story.\n\nNow let's not forget why we all really play any of the Sonic Adventure games...CHAO!\nThis game features 3 Chao gardens. A Neutral, Hero and Dark. Hero and Dark gardens can only be unlocked when you have raised a Chao with the respective sided characters. The Chao land features a school, where you can buy items at the Black Market, put your Chao into classes to be taught dances, drawing, instruments and other nice abilities or go to the Fortune Teller to get a badass name. Many hours will be spent here, just like in the previous game. You can send your Chao into races as always to win medals and items for your Chao and also put them into karate matches if you have the DLC.\n\nAll in all, it's an amazing game and plays smoother than Sonic Adventure did originally, however both amazing games!\n\n10/10.","February 2, 2015","true","19.5"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","27","33","0","0"

Even though I agree on that, I still have to say many things in Sonic Adventure 2 are just not as good as in 1. For example in Adventure 2,  The level geometry gets in the way of your momentum sometimes, immediately stopping you. There are many examples like that that shows how lazy this game was programmed in comparison to the first game. But still, the level design is better than in Adventure 1. It is more fun. Its soundtrack is amazing. Every level is great ( Even though many people do dislike the hunting and mecha-levels ).\n\nConclusionOverall you can say, great soundtrack, great level design, veriation of gameplay mechanics BUT the high speed level-gameplay is worse than adventure 1 since you can get stuck easily.\n\nRating: 8/10","June 15, 2015","true","34.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

Game was very well received by critics and fans. But how it holds up today? Let's find out.\n\nStory\nUnlike newer games, this one haves a story. Although there are plot holes, it's still pretty good one. It's dark, takes itself seriously...... but there are few jokes here and there. Why can't Sonic games have good stories anymore? What happened with characters such as Shadow, Knuckles, Espio, Omega etc. WAKE UP SONIC TEAM!\n\nGameplay\nThere are 3 gameplay styles. Speed, treasure hunting and mech battle staged.\nGoal of speed stages is to get to the goal ring as fast as possible while getting points by destroying enemies and doing tricks. Stages are a blast to play!\nGoal of treasure hunting stages Is to collect 3 pieces of master emerald, 3 keys or 3 chaos emeralds. It's pretty good but your radar shows you one emerald at time. Which is a let down from SADX\nGoal of mech battle stages is to get as many points as possible by defeating enemies until you get to the end of the level where is goal ring. Still really fun to play.\n\nSoundtrack\nI can listen to Live and Learn for hours. Besides that, every single song kicks ♥♥♥!\n\nOverall\nBest sonic game ever created. 10/10\nIt really is sad seeing how much franchise got ruined after 06. Stories don't take itself seriously anymore, Crush 40 doesn't exist anymore, only Sonic is playable, Shadow is ruined character.... And they are milking Sonic Boom.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother day brings another adventure.

So I know the game off by heart. For this review, I use keyboard controls.\n\nShort story: GET THIS FOR THE CHAO GARDEN!\n\n\n--PRO's--\n\n- Chao Garden\n- Music\n- Childhood memories\n- Controller supported\n- Controls can be changed\n\n\n--CON's--\n\n- Tails/Eggman have slow/laggy movement\n- Knuckles/Rouge has camera issues (may be down to Keyboard controls)\n- Chao Karate & 2 Player Battle is cut into DLC (Greedy Shods)\n- Local Multiplayer (No Online Mode)\n\n\nThe camera issues don't bother me, I understand due to using a keyboard that the camera will not be as great and to be honest, is just the same as the GC one. It is just a port, no real improvement. But Tails has missing animation frames and seems to stop before turning which is an issue, specially when you fight Eggman at the end of HERO story due to you are so slow. Same goes for Eggman, making their levels appear to have frame-rate issues.\n\nEven though the tags say "Multiplayer", it is local multiplayer only, you need a mod to race others online. Local multiplayer is not good either you share the same keyboard making it cramped, bad idea there SEGA.\n\nOnly get this game when it is on sale or if you really miss the Chao Garden & don't have the original game anymore. Otherwise give it a miss for now as it is not worth the full asking price.","February 10","true","24.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It has some control issues at times but I never really felt cheated by it much. There are so many game modes and content that adds so much to the game. The part that will keep you coming back for more are the chaos. They are these little creatures that evolve depending on the items you give them that you found in levels. It adds a lot of replay value to the game and it is just a blast. You can enter them in tournaments once you feel they are strong enough and the fun really begins!

So when I found out it was on Steam I was excited. And it did not disappoint me. The game is an older game, so some things still persist like incomplete lip syncing in cutscenes or the music being louder than the dialogue at times. But there are subtitles to read if you can not fully hear the dialogue. There are added sound effects during the beginning of boss fights or when throwing switches, like in Crazy Gadget where there are far more sound effects for various panels than back in 2001. Now as a game itself, for me it plays well, even the hard mode is challenging but not unbeatable, the plot is the same of course but you will know pain, thy name Biolizard, and has replay value in the Chao Garden, Kart Racing, Boss Attack, and five modes per stage. And the unlockable if you get 180 emblems. Multiplayer is just as fun as before too with multiple modes and the almighty Grind Race. Curse you Metal Sonic. There are a variety of characters to play as, rather deep story, and multiple modes to play, something some in the fandom complain current games lack, making this game a plus. This game comes from an era where complaining was not as critical. So if you are looking to get into Sonic games, and want a somewhat straight forward but challenging game to play, this is definitely a game you'd need in your collection.","July 7, 2014","true","23.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Firstly I was 6/7 years old at the time, everything looks different then second off, Sonic was the character that solidified my interest in games so I wouldn't hesitate to get if I could, I did and was not disappointed.  I'll explain that elsewhere.  Due to being young I never saw SA2 advertised but games within its era made references to it I only understood years later, so you can imagine how  felt when I got this and realised that it is some of the best sonic team have to offer.\n\nSure, it was easy to lose momentum in areas and having to wait to activate the spindash took getting used to but once you got the full set of powers you were almost unstoppable.  I know thta people would like another game like this but it's often better to leave things where they are.  Yuji Naka's not there anymore and neither are Yoshihisa Hashimoto or a lot of the development team, that vision's gone.  It's not impossible since Sonic Lost World PC has shown SEGA are doing their best to listen to fans but a lot of things are better left alone.\n\nBottom line, Story's great, multiplayer is good every now and then,  the character's are fleshed out enough and the gameplay is simple enough to warrant replayability.  I know many people find the original cast's voice acting cringeworthy but hey, it's better than mainstream series e.g COD, Tomb Raider, Battlefield and the rest where cusses are warranted every few minutes.  Definitely worth a buy if you haven't played the originals.","December 6, 2015","true","101.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","9","10","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/213610/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D platformers that mixes three gameplay styles in one game, being part of Sonic franchise. It was one of the last games to come out on Sega Dreamcast in 2001 and can be taken as Sega's "farewell". Shortly, it was ported to Gamecube, getting "Battle" subtitle, bringing new addition to multiplayer mode and chao garden. It also had small tweaks to it and didn't have neither small Downloadable Contnet that Dreamcast version had, mostly skins, nor Dreamcast's VMU to play tamagochi with your chao.\nAnd now in 2012 Sega decided that Sonic Adventure 2 might be great enough to get HD rerelease for PS3, X360 and Steam, with it coming to PC for the first time ever.\n\nSo, here we have our modern Steam version of the game. As you noticed, Sega decided to separate game into just "Sonic Adventure 2" and DLC "Battle". DLC adds all the new content that Gamecube version had over Dreamcast one, which isn't much for single-player game, unless you want all achievement. Technically, just "Sonic Adventure 2" is more like Sonic Adventure 2 Battle with content cut down to Dreamcast level, not real Dreamcast version, the difference being in various small tweaks. BUT it does bring Big The Cat cameos in every level back. Funny.\nA big feature of modern ports is widescreens support. All of the gameplay is now taking whole space of your wide monitors, with only Full Motion Videos and some of the cutscenes still retaining 4:3 aspect ratio.\nIt's quite a solid PC port, I don't remember seeing any new glitches. But multiplayer is local only.\n\nGame has both singleplayer and multiplayer modes to play.\nNow, I didn't get to try multiplayer, but it's a competive one. Could be lots of fun. But the only thing I can say is that it's common knowledge that Amy is OP.\n\nSingle-player is divided into two campaigns, Dark and Hero. Each of those two have the same three gameplay styles for three characters. Speed sections are the ones that Sonic fans expect and they were greatly improved over Sonic Adventure one, making them feel tight, challenging and more designed to be the blast to replay and better your score. Mech stages aren't as fast-paced and have more of primitive shooting mixed with platforming, with the Sega's style of ability of "put few enemies under the target and then release fire to have them all killed for big score". Treasure Hunting are more of exploration of huge stages, where you have to get yourself familiar with mazey layout and then use hint system and radar to track three pieces of needed item.\n\nAnd while it does improve on gameplay, it has a fault of getting on more generic territory when it comes to universe. Gone are colorful otherwordly strange levels, instead you will spend time in more generic places, like city, forest and space station. The most Sonic-like stage you will get there is egypt-style with ghosts. Spooks. Then again, these generic stages are still colorful and are nice in their own way.\nMusic once again changed style. It's not as varied as the Sonic Adventure, aside from stereotypical rap for Knuckles and jazz for Rogue. Everything else is mostly techno and guitar work. And yet it's awesome, catchy and you will remember them for a while! They also provide intense feel at times.\n\nPlot is quite darker this time. Instead of seeing perspective of six characters individually, you will get storytelling from the two sides. It's not deep and got some holes in it. Strange stuff, that sometimes feel were left out. Animation in cutscenes also got improved, they aren't too hilarious anymore. They sometimes move like puppets though. And I have to say that Dark Side is done better than Hero Side. Darkies are the ones who lead the plot and deal with mystery of Shadow. Heroes are just confused Sonic and his friends reacting to whatever happens.\n\nAnd I have to say most important thing. The campaign is NOT fun to play for the first time. It got a huge pacing issues that ruin fun and turn it into patience test.Those three gameplay styles are mixed together seemingly randomly and change every single mission around. They are differently paced and fit for different kind of gamers, and even if you enjoy them all, they swap around to quick to get used to. Even worse is that plot often on Hero Side's is being interrupted by Knuckles with his slow-paced gameplay. Oh yes, and some enemies are quite cheap. I have no idea how to avoid attack of liquid monsters in last levels. Though, I don't think that Mech stages enemies are cheap, it's just that after getting used in earlier stages that you can just walk until the end calmly don't get you ready to actually avoid projectiles.\n\nBut once you get through campaign, you will get ability to select any level you want... And this is where fun begins. Not only because you can select any gameplay type you feel like doing right now. There are 5 missions for every level, the first mission being just "beat the level" and the last mission always being Hard Mode. Even more, for first time ever in Sonic games, it got a rating system. Upon completing levels you will be given one of the five grades, A being the highest, based on the final scores. While time score matters there, you will get a lot by destroying gold robot, doing tricks, defeating as many enemies in a row as possible and collecting more rings. As said, Sonic games are easy to play, easy-hard to beat but difficult to master. Even kart stages start to make sense when you have mission not to touch walls, having to drift into corners (release and press jump button again while turning to get into drifting mode). Some of the mission grade A requirements are quite insane though, so I doubt that you will 100% the game easily at all.\nActually, just knowing the pace of the game after beating it will help you enjoy game more when rebeating it. Which quite explains why those who played the original version praise Sonic Adventure 2, while newcomers get bad taste of it.\n\nYou also will get to unlock Boss Rush mode.\nAnd Kart mode, which is more of bonus game. Drifting is nice, but it's not Daytona. And characters aren't balanced around each other, some character have no chances to keep up with AI cars, who don't even make look that they their cars are being controlled in same ways.\nDeveloper video will be unlocked in options after some amount of hours being played. Where developers will tell you few small anecdotes/facts from the development and that's about it.\n\nOh, and this time, getting all 130 emblems will give you not only achievement, but a little bonus level. Shame that in order to do that you have to also get emblems from Chao Garden part of game. And DLC too.\n\nYea, Chao Garden, that tamagochi thing. Where you have to find chao key on stage and also feed chao 10 animals you brought along. And then watch them grow. And stuff. It's not really a thing for gamers. Then again, Sonic games's main auditory are young people anyway, but still, not something traditional gamers will care about. Just grind with 10 animals over and over again.\nDreamcast actually had this little thing where memory unit had it's own control on it and you could take it with yourself as "portable handheld". Though, more like tamagochi. And you could raise chao on it when you was outside of home. Or at least find useful items for them. So it was making more sense back then.\n\nSo, not a good game to beat, but awesome one to master. Recommended to Sonic fans and those who tend to replay stages they liked, instead of abandoning game after beating it.\nThen again, there isn't so many 3D Platformers on Steam right now, so may take it anyway.","May 29, 2015","true","52.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The graphics are fluid and run at high frame rates. It scales well to Full HD and it just works, all the time.\n\nThe game is diverse, the storyline weaves and bobs and the levels are challenging. This is no easy game, many other Sonic titles are far easier to play and get high scores with, but this is what we would call "old school". The coolest aspect of this game is the new abilities of the characters, for example, Sonic can grind on rails.\n\nThe music, by the band Crush 40 and others, was especially apt for this game and I loved it. The game also introduced a few new characters to the franchise (Rouge the Bat, Shadow The Hedgehog) and also sheds some light on the origins of Dr Eggman and his evil ways. For the first time, Dr Eggman is a playable character.\n\nDiverse levels, from Ancient Egyptian pyramids, Jungles, and into space, there's something for everyone here.","December 29, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I was, however, delightedly mistaken. Never before have I experienced a game quite like this. I traveled at blistering speeds through unfamiliar worlds in red and white shoes, with nothing to stop me from overcoming death-defying obstacles and blasting through countless amounts of enemies.\nThe amazing voice acting Ryan Drummond instantly brought life into the unbelievable world, and the story felt like a blast of fresh air. The pursuit of the blue blur's dark doppleganging enemy's identity is explored and often provides insight on what actually makes a person human. The game makes the player question their own morality and gives numerous options such as choosing to make heroic or dark choices throughout the main storyline.\nNever after completing a video game have I sat for hours and pondered the experience. This game not only introduced me to the obscure "Sonic the Hedgehog" franchise, but helped me have more of an appreciation for video games as an artform.\nI higly recommend this game to anyone looking for an exhilarating rush of excitement and wonder.","January 3, 2014","true","3.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/213610/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","I reviewed this game years ago, but I'm rewriting it to be a little more informative than my previous entry.\n\nSonic Adventure 2 is without a doubt my favourite installation in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, the amount of time that I spent playing this as a child on the Gamecube is impossible to measure. This game has higher replay value than almost every game I have ever played and the Steam Version only adds to that further, I'll elaborate a little further into the review.\n\nThis game offers the choice of playing the story out from two different perspectives, the hero side and the dark side. The story isn't anything overly unique, but a typical Sonic the Hedgehog scenario: Dr. Eggman is trying to take over the World with the assistance of two new entries to the series (at this point in tine), Shadow and Rouge. The World is powerless to stop them after taking over the abandoned space Colony ARK and reactivating a weapon capable of destroying planets, thus leaving it up to Sonic, Tailsand Knuckles to stop him.\n\nThe core gameplay consists of three different stage types:\n\n- Action Stages: Play as either Sonic or Shadow in high-speed race to the finish levels overcoming numerous obstacles and challenges. Definitely the most fun of the three different stage types and the closest thing to the original Sonic feeling.\n\n- Treasure Hunting: Play as either Knuckles or Rouge using hints and a radar to locate hidden pieces of the master emerald around various maps. This is a mixed bag for most players as it can prove to be frustrating unless you've played the levels before, but it breaks the ganeplay up nicely in my opinion.\n\n- Shooting Stages: Play as either Tails or Dr. Eggman (yes, you get to play as EGGMAN in this game, why haven't you already bought it?) in a set of shoot-em-up style stages. Another nice addition to break up the gameplay a little bit and can be a lot of fun with the exception of a few stages (Eternal Engine, ugh), it's very satisfying to rake in a huge number of points and go for the A ranks.\n\nThe game unlocks some minigames as you progress through the story mode stages, Kart Racing and Boss Battles. Kart Racing is a nice addition, though admittedly nothing overly fancy, just a generic racing game with some unlockable karts, a throw back to Sonic Drift. The Boss Battles are as you'd expect, boss rushes for each story mode once you complete the stories.\n\nArguably the best feature of the game is the Chao garden. Chao are creatures that you can raise and train to play Racing and Karate mini games. What Chao themselves are is difficult to explain, but I've always seen them as virtual pets in the case of Sonic Adventure 2, you raise and train them by collecting certain items in the main game stages and delivering them to the Chao Garden after obtaining a special key in the stages. There is a lot of depth and information to cover on this so I won't go into it any further to prevent a bigger wall of text, I suggest reading about them on the SA2 Wiki if you're curious.\n\nEverytime you complete a stage or mission, you acquire an Emblem, of which there are a total of 180. Emblems are another thing that extend the replayability of the game as collecting them all requires completing different missions from different stages and achieving A ranks. They aren't mandatory for completing the game, but they definitely give you a reason to keep coming back for another round.\n\nWhile a lot of fun, it is difficult to play the Steam version on a keyboard, this is a game that is definitely better with a controller, I strongly advise using an Xbox pad if you have one. The lack of online multiplayer is a real shame which is the only real fault that I have with the Steam version of the game, the oopportunity was there but it wasn't taken. Local multiplayer is available for the 2 Player Battle DLC, a must have for this game, very fun and competitive multiplayer gamrs to be had for all stage types with additional characters to chose from.\n\nI will defend this game to the death against haters and those who don't appreciate it's replayability, however, one thing that has always and will always bother me about this game is the clunky camera. Many times have a been short of an A rank or even lost a life as a result of the camera glitching out. Thankfully this doesn't happen too often, but you will notice it upon a playthrough of the stories, particularly in the Treasure Hunting modes.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth every penny, it is practically given away during sales.

All of the features found in the Gamecube version are there, except for the Battle features which are in a very affordable DLC.

( I have a somewhat older PC. ) Nonetheless, it's not game breaking. Adventure along in a really well made game and have access to the Chao mini-game, which is almost more popular than the main game and very addictive.

Don't let that be a factor that makes you change your choice of buying this, though.\n\nSonic Adventure 2 managed to successfully continue the formula of Sonic Adventure in a slightly altered way. The game is split into three styles, the speed levels (Sonic/Shadow), the mech shooting stages (Tails/Eggman) and the very, VERY bad treasure hunting stages (Knuckles/Rouge).\n\nThe speed levels are the best part of the game. No doubt. But, they are slightly more linear than SA1's Sonic stages, which is a disappointment. Luckily, they are still awesome.\n\nThe mech stages are clunky but bearable. Just be ready for some annoyances.\n\nThe treasure hunting is despicable. Luckily the stages are usually rather small and are not as common as the other stages.\n\n\nWhile SA2 is flawed in some major aspects, the game is pretty darn replayable. The game has an improved Chao Garden from SA1, which is very addictive. Plus, every level has 5 missions, and if you want to 100% the game, you will need to A Rank every stage and fully complete the Chao missions.\n\nAlso, SA2 has probably the best multiplayer in any main-title Sonic game. So that's a plus.\n\n\nUltimately, I do recommend SA2HD, and it is pretty cheap online. If you want to experience a bit of a 3D Sonic classic, then pick this up.","December 23, 2013","true","24.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Sonic Adventure 2 refined it to an art. Sonic Adventure had troubles with a sometimes too simple story. We had a few too many stupid play styles like big the cat. The controls wern't very tight especially in the HD PC version. Which on PC could make you scream and at times is unplayable unless you have 3rd party software for a Controller. But in Sonic Adventure 2 it's not that case at all, Playing City Escape and Ratical Highway felt completely smooth for the keyboard and was optimized very well. The music in this game is arguably the best in the franchise. Mainly City Escape and the final boss fight theme. This game introduced Shadow the hedgog which was so great that it inspired a completely new game. i could go way farther into this game but i don't wanna spoil the game's full plot. Sonic Adventure 2 has taken everything from Sonic Adeventure DX and sharpened it to perfection. The levels are much more fun. They have trimmed the fat like Big the cat. Added some of the best sound tracks Sonic has ever had. Added very interesting characters and made the controls way tighter and actually optimized very well for the PC HD version. The graphics compared to the gamecube and Sega saturn version, Has been completely overhalled. The FPS rate was boosted all the way from a 20-25 fps rate all the way to 60 frames which makes this feel like a completely new experience. Updated textures and HD graphics makes this the definitive 3D Sonic Experience. This is one of my Favorite games of all time.

If your connection drops, the game outright pauses until it reconnects. I found this out the hard way after playing on my work laptop. The ♥♥♥♥ing worst kind of DRM.\n-Battle edition is paywalled behind DLC\n-They did not add online multiplayer to Battle even though it would have benefitted the game greatly\n-There's no special minigame for external devices in the chao garden because this is PC\n-Performs somewhat poorly on lower end PCs, like this is some kind of straight console port from the PS3 or X360 version\n\nIf you absolutely must get this game and PC isn't your only option, get the gamecube version.

For the people driven by nostalgia, this will be a sour trip, or a fun revisting of a childhood game. If you're new to this game, you might want to turn back.\n\nSonic Adventure 2 is the PC port of one of the "best" Sonic games. It was pretty fun back then, and now that I went back to it, I'm kinda worried. Sure it has the iconic "Escape From The City" music, but Sonic Adventure 2 isn't very memorable. The level design is.... cool, I guess. There's a lot of different themes, and it is pretty cool. The platforming levels are pretty cool, but some levels with robot powerups and stuff are just downright annoying. This game is a slippery platformer, but it still has some charm.\n\nThe chao raising is what everyone remembers, and for good reason. You get to raise your own Chao! YEAH!\n\nI can't tell if this game is outdated or not, because the nostalgia is getting in the way, but it can be fun, sometimes.\nYou're going to have to play this game is you want an honest review, because I heard about people who loved it and people who despised it. I would say it's just "okay".\n\n\n","December 1, 2013","true","1.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","3"

Sonic Adventure 2 is available on many consoles, but the game was originally released for Dreamcast.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  In Sonic Adventure 2, Eggman (Doctor Robotnik) has plans to take over the world by using a secret weapon that his grandfather created, that is how he meets Shadow the Hedgehog who offers to help Eggman take over the world.\nThere are two stories that are running parallel to each other in Sonic Adventure 2: the Hero and Villain stories. You play as: Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles for the Hero story. Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge for the villain story.\nA couple new characters were added to the franchise in Sonic Adventure 2; Rouge the Bat and my personal favorite, Shadow the hedgehog. These additional characters were created to balance out the game play and give you a second set of characters to play as through the game a second time.\nUnfortunately not long after this game was released, Sonic Team went crazy with the characters and decided to make a game with all of Sonic's little animal friends. Generally overwhelming the standard sonic-gamer-fans (some/most of the characters had existed in comic series and other minor video games before release. But it was the first time many had seen them in a big name game).\n\nGame Play: I hate to knock the controls ...but the most obnoxious part about this game was definitely the controls. It was annoying to control the camera and movement, with a controller when I played Sonic Adventure 2 on the GameCube; it didn't improve at all when playing with a keyboard and mouse.\nOther then the obnoxious controls, the game itself is pretty fun and there are many different ways to complete levels, get unlockables, accessories, level ranking, including a mini feature with "Chao".\nCall me a sucker, but half of the reason I bought this game on steam was because I loved raising Chao, and I hated sharing the GameCube with my brothers while we all raised our Chao. So I purchased the game, and got that out of my system... mostly.\nTo be more specific, Chao are little alien-looking-creatures with a dot that hovers above their head. (Just Google it, okay?) Depending on how you raise your Chao they will look different and you'll unlock two new area's depending on the Chao you raise and who you raise it with. I personally liked to raise them with Villains so they all had the most adorable evil smiles. (Yes, I'm fan girling, yes I play the Sims, Shaddup.)\n\nAchievements: Ugh... Do I need to mention this part? There are steam achievements, but there is only one "freebee" achievement, the rest are awarded for completing long objectives (such as beat the game, beat it with the other team, raise a villain and hero Chao, get all of all the things, get "A" on each level)\nI'm currently sitting at 7/15 achievements there is only one or two more achievements that I think I can get, the rest are too difficult to get without putting an ungodly amount of time into the game to get perfect ranks on ever single level.\n\nPrice: Sonic Adventure 2 is priced at $9.99 I personally waited until a steam sale before I purchased the game. There's enough content to play through the game for 9+ hours , however unless you already know you like sonic games, that's a bit of a risky purchase. You would be better off buying this game on sale, or playing a sonic game that is much easier on the controls.\n\nConclusion: I'm on the fence for this one, I found the game more enjoyable then annoying, but I've always been more patient with video games than most people. If you want to buy a Chao Growing Simulator, this is the right game for you. If you want a solid Sonic running-speedy-blurry-graphic-game, you should probably skip this and look for another one.\nI Recommend this game to Sonic Fans, GameCube/Dreamcast owners, and anyone else who might be mildly interested in trying out Sonic Adventure 2.\n","May 4, 2015","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This was the first game I ever owned back on the Nintendo GameCube and I have many fond memories from my childhood 'rolling around at the speed of sound' . So, when I heard it was available on Steam I had to buy it straight away. Sonic Adventure 2 Battle has an amazing story line which is playable from both Sonic, Tails and Knuckles' point of view or Shadow, Eggman and Rogue's. The best part of the game by far, however, are the Chao Gardens. The Breeding and later unlockable Hero and Dark gardens offer the players the ability to raise 24 Chaos at a time and compete them in karate competitions and races for badges and toys for their gardens. You can breed chaos together using heart fruits to pair up traits and make rare chaos. I promise that you will spend more time in the Chao garden than you will playing the actual game. That being said I did notice a few glitches which although annoying at times did not influence the game play. Overall, a great game which is definitely worth the paying for.","October 22, 2015","true","7.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frighty/recommended/213610/","Frighty","Skörda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Frighty/","99 products in account","One of my first and favorite games in the SEGA Dreamcast library. Sonic Adventure 2 was the second game to feature modern Sonic's style and persona.\n\nSonic Adventure 2 is less comical and a bit more gritty than the modern-day Sonic game, where Dr. Eggman for once isn't the true antagonist. Is that bad thing? No it isn't, in fact, I like it better when the storylines were like this. Shadow and Rouge were also introduced, as much as how Shadow is now represented with "haha i'm better than you" kind of feel, this game provided him with a backstory that now feels completely ignored. Not to mention when you unlock the Last Story, this game makes a dramatic turn, I knew when I unlocked it as a kid, I was in for something.\n\nSonic's reputation is plummeting, though I feel if SEGA were to look back at this game, they could make a recovery with good execution. This game's only issue for me is the bad camera angles, and the english dub dialogue always cuts other dialogue off in cutscenes. Other than that, this game eternally represents my childhood.","February 19","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is cheesy, with terrble but lovable voice acting and a somehow heartwarming final chapter. Essentially, Dr Eggman releases a super powerful weapon that his grandfather built years before, known as the ultimate life form - Shadow the hedgehog. Shadow tells eggman that as a reward for rescuing him, he will tell him of a way to achieve world domination. Shadow shows eggman to ARK - A space Colony that was abandoned when Eggmans Grandfather was arrested, and the place where shadow was made. On the ark is a weapon of mass destruction, the eclipse canon, which can blow up pretty much any planet when it has all 7 chaos emeralds. Rouge The Bat, a thief appears and agrees to help them find the emeralds. Sonic on the other hand is getting chased by the police, who somehow think the famous blue hedgehog hero guy is suddenly black.\nEnough about the story, the main gameplay has 3 varietys, Sonic and Shadow have the speedy platforming levels. you have a spindash, you grind rails, get some great powerups, these are by far the best and momst interesting levels in the game. Next are the Treasure hunt levels, featuring knuckles and rouge. I personally enjoy these, the characters are fast, have good attacks, the levels are designed creatively, and knuckles music is usually pretty great, if incredibly cheesy. Finally, there are the worst levels in the game - Mech levels, in which you are Eggman or Tails, piloting a mech and shooting things. these levels aren't terrible, however until you get the jet booster (It lets you hover after a jump, to make platforming more accurate) they can be disgusting and offputting.\nMy least favourite level in the game is the 3rd level on the dark side, Sand Ocean. You're eggman, doing tricky platforming with moving platforms and stuff, it's very dark, the music sucks and you don't have the booster, making platforming horrendously tedius. To make matters worse, you're surrounded by quick sand, so missing a jump will result in death.\n\nThe game has quite a few bosses, some better than others. The standard GUN robots are easy and I wouldn't call them good bossfights. The last eggman/tails bossfight is challenging, the last 2 bosses of the game are pretty great, the second last being really difficult, the Last sonic v shadow fight is alright, it doesn't make it explicitly clear what you have to do though, so get creative. The game does have a bossrush mode, so Bosses are readily replayable. I wouldn't call this game hard, it's pretty easy to pick up and play, though it does have  maybe 2 partially difficult levels and a difficult bossfight, nothing you can't overcome\nAfter the main gameplay is the Chao garden, you raise a chao as a pet. Take it from me, I've owned this game on 4 other systems, the Chao garden is just the best thing ever. So much charm, so much fun, so much personilisation. For those who wonder what I mean, try giving nothing but birds to a chao, and make sonic give it them. Within a few hours, it'll turn pink and grow jesters like a NiGHT character, Give it just tigers and It'll turn green and eventually blue, and grow sonic spines (Do it with shadow and it'll be black with red) This is just a few of the things you can make.\nThe music is just fantastic, Jun Senoue is back with more great music, alongside many other artists. The games main theme is 'Live and Learn' A great hard rock ballad, The pop rock 'Escape from the city' By Ted Poley accompanies Sonics first level, with a fantastic bassline. All of knuckles levels feature cheesy raps, but they aren't as bad as everyone says (A ghost tried to approach me and got married) Shadow has as Techno theme in his levels, Even if you aren't buying this game you should definately look up the soundtrack, in true SEGA/Sonic Team fashion the music is truely brilliant. Buy ths game.","January 26, 2014","true","61.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

This game is huge. There are 2 storylines, the Hero one (Knuckles, Tails, and Sonic) and a Dark side (New character- Shadow, New Character -Rouge, Eggman, and Darth Vader) Okay, I'm kidding with Darth Vader! Shadow the Hedgehog and Sonic both are speedy, so that is the kind of level they get. Oh no, the Knux and Rouge's levels. They need to find Master Emerald shards which are so hard to find.  And the Tails and Eggman mech levels. You have to get to the end while shooting G.U.N robots.\n\nPros:\nSpeed\nGood Music\nNew characters\nRaise a chao\nDon't need to buy a Dreamcast/ Gamecube\nAll levels are fun but sometimes frustrating\nStoryline makes sense\nCons:\nEggman/ Tails over bottomless pits A LOT\nKnuckles/ Rouge levels are tricky and giant\nSome wicked camera angles\nNo Sonic 3 elemental shields\n\nDo I reccomend this? Sort of, closer to the Yes answer instead of no, so buy it, but prepare to take a breath and count to 10. This is very frustrating on a few levels. IGN Walkthroughs can be your friend.\n\n\nOverall 6.8 stars of a possible 10.\n\nThis isn't as good as Skyrim or the Genesis games, but it is pretty good.

I owned it for the Dreamcast, I currently own Sonic Adventure 2:Battle for the Gamecube, and now own this on Steam. Countless hours of gameplay, tons of things to do, 2 different story lines(Hero and Dark), and plent of side things to do beyond the main storyline. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is a major Sonic fan. Now that being said, The audio is a little messed up when it comes to cutscenes(voices not matching up with the character speaking mostly) but besides that it plays very well even on a computer like mine that's not really mean't for gaming. I have a Intel(R) G41 Express Chipset with 3GB of Ram and it runs decent, sometimes it's a little laggy but not to the point where it majorly effects gameplay. Definitely a recommend coming from a dedicated Sonic fan.","January 20, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now for my english review, this game is definetly NOT WITH OUT IMPURITY, meaning it's got quite a few glitchy, frusterating or unsatisfactory qualities, but ultimately this is one of my most favorite games in history. Sound-wise, It has AMAZING music, interesting sound effects, slightly embarrasing voice acting for some characters, and sometimes tacky dialog in some scenes. Graphically it's very vivid - I like the art style, but youcan obviously tell this is a very old game. It's physics are as unrealistic as you'd expect from any Sonic game, but it's passable.\n\nIt's story is in some ways goofy (again, it's a Sonic game) but you can get very attached to the characters - more so than in most sonic games and it has an usually decent ending for a kid's game with...dramatic elements you don't normally expect. Many people hate this game because it and it's predecessor were the first time Sega tried to make Sonic into a 3D-game. Many people didn't like the switch of gameplay style, but I love this, and this right here is the only time for a very long time (until Sonic Generations) they got it (almost) perfect. Many other bad sonic games spawned from this (such as Sonic Unleashed) - but please, despite what you may have heard, give this game a chance. It may ♥♥♥♥ you off sometimes, it may make you laugh sometimes, but when you really get down with this, you'll cherish it. This game is a true gem from the ancient past reformatted for modern platforms and given a mild HD retexture.","November 27, 2012","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Do I actually need to say anything to convince you to get this? I mean, come on, IT'S SANIC.\n\nIn all (or at least a bit more) seriousness, I first played this game waaay back when it came out on the Nintendo Gamecube. I must have been 7 or 8 at the time, and this was the best thing to grace this earth since yours truly. Playing it again all these years later, it's certainly not the absolute perfect masterpiece that it was to me before, but surprisingly, it's withstood the test of time and I once again have written it off as a great game. Gameplay is smooth and easy to control (though the camera has a tendency to prove uncontrollable at the worst times), and I actually really like the variety in play styles depending on what character and stage you're playing (Sonic/Shadow speed runs vs. Knuckles/Rouge treasure hunting vs. Tails/Eggman... mech shooting I guess?). Another thing worth noting is that the graphics have actually been updated for the Steam release of the game, which is really nice. And while they're not exactly super high-res textures, they're much better than the 256x256 textures in the original game. There are even some... interesting easter eggs in some levels that didn't exist in the original game.\nOverall, if you're a Sonic fan (heck, even if you're not. I don't even like the franchise all that much), this game's worth a play. Even if you played it way back on the Gamecube (or even the Dreamcast), it's one of those games that you just have to revisit.","February 27, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While playing through the story, I spent a lot of time raising my chao, which I may or may not have become slightly obsessed over, and even after finishing the story, I still played with them, and played on multiplayer mode with a friend, which was also really fun and enjoyable.\n\nPlaying the game again, now on PC, was very nostalgic, the graphics seem to remain unchanged, and the controls are rather awkward without a controller, but even when I was little, the thing that impressed me was the story, which suddenly doesn't seem as in depth, but it's still very good, specially the ability to see the whole thing from both the perspective of the good guys and the bad, taking into account each character's specific interests.\n\nThe levels are very well designed, with a good mix between puzzles, action and running around being awesome, graphics are rather outdated, but the game is playable, and has a good difficulty curve.

Do I actually need to say anything to convince you to get this? I mean, come on, IT'S SANIC.\n\nIn all (or at least a bit more) seriousness, I first played this game waaay back when it came out on the Nintendo Gamecube. I must have been 7 or 8 at the time, and this was the best thing to grace this earth since yours truly. Playing it again all these years later, it's certainly not the absolute perfect masterpiece that it was to me before, but surprisingly, it's withstood the test of time and I once again have written it off as a great game. Gameplay is smooth and easy to control (though the camera has a tendency to prove uncontrollable at the worst times), and I actually really like the variety in play styles depending on what character and stage you're playing (Sonic/Shadow speed runs vs. Knuckles/Rouge treasure hunting vs. Tails/Eggman... mech shooting I guess?). Another thing worth noting is that the graphics have actually been updated for the Steam release of the game, which is really nice. And while they're not exactly super high-res textures, they're much better than the 256x256 textures in the original game. There are even some... interesting easter eggs in some levels that didn't exist in the original game.\nOverall, if you're a Sonic fan (heck, even if you're not. I don't even like the franchise all that much), this game's worth a play. Even if you played it way back on the Gamecube (or even the Dreamcast), it's one of those games that you just have to revisit.","February 27, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this Sonic game, you play as the Hero and Dark side, as Sonic, Knuckles and Tails on the Hero side, with Shadow, Rogue and Dr. Eggman at the Dark side. You complete levels, as you progress farther and farther into the world. Each completion earns a emblem.\n\nBesides the regular beating of a level, there are three other options in each level to complete for which you also get an emblem, up to a total of 180 emblems throughout the entire game, which will unlock an extra zone. Personally I achieved approximately 178 emblems on the Dreamcast, and I never got farther than that.\n\nThis game, is and will always be, my favourite Sonic game of all time. To all who are planning on getting this, it is a definate recommendation.

In a nutshell, this game is frickin' awesome. No joke. For as long as I can remember I've played Sonic Adventure 2 BATTLE on the GameCube, but I was young and careless so I accidentally ruined the game by leaving it out and the dog stepped on it. Oops. Anyway, I was super psyched when I found out that I could buy and download the game on my laptop, so I did. By the way I am not dissapointed at all whatsoever. One thing you should know however is that this is a steam version of the original Sonic Adventure 2 for DreamCast, and not the GC version. Don't let that stop you from buying it though because it is almost exactly the same. In fact, you can even find Big the Cat in (I think) every stage, unlike the GC version. You can even raise little chao!!!\n\nLittle tip though, because this IS a Sonic game it will be fast and a little difficult to control at first with the whole WASD controler Lol but you do get the hang of it eventually. However, when I was attempting to clear Hard Mode with Rouge at Mad Space (raise your hand if you hate that level) I still haven't been able to do the screw kick (I think that's the name of the kick, but it may be something else) to get the last shard of the Master Emerald because it is VERY difficult to make a circle and press the button for 'b' with WASD controls...\n\nOther than that minor detail, it's a great game that had me hooked when I was younger and even to this day. Heck, I've played it on steam for a VERY long time. The three different stories is probably my favorite part of the game along with the chao and whatnot.\n\n10/10 I highly reccomend :3","January 16","true","147.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay\nthe Gameplay is split into 3 styles: speed,treasure huntinghunting, and mech shooting. with the speed you take control of Sonic and Shadow and the levels are centered around that aspect so it isn't as open as adventure 1 but still the levels are a TON of fun.Treasure hunting (I couldn't think of a better name) is where you take control of rouge or knuckles and you go through these large stages climbing and gliding to collect 3 things that the stage needs in random places and I really like this style. Now mech shooting in this you play as eggman and tails targeting onto as many robots as possible for the best score and again this is a style I like.\nMusic; The music is awesome I love\nGraphics: the graphics are really good (look these last 2 aren't that important to me so I keep them to a minimum.\nStory: ehh Don't want to spoiler it to much to sumarize just look up The Completionist's video on SA2 and get the story from there.\nOverall 8.5/10 Great game","January 29","true","63.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will admit there are various plotholes within the story. I don't really care though because the story itself it entertaining probably only beat out by the originals. I also love when characters cut each other off in cutscenes! lol The story basically without spoilers is that Eggman wants to take over the planet using a weapon of mass destruction as bait. On his journey he finds his grandfathers greating accomplishment, Shadow the Ultimate Life Form. Shadow shows eggman the Space Colony Arc and how to use the weapon. Rouge then shows up and offers to help them find the chaos emeralds. On the hero side Sonic escapes from the government, he was arrested because he was mistaken for Shadow. After running around ramped for a while he finally gets captured so tails has to free him. Knuckles is searching for the pieces of the master emerald like always. When they catch wind of Eggmans plans They follow him to space to try and stop him. I made all of that very vague so I didn't spoil all that much.\n\n-Graphics\nThey aren't the best because game is decently old, and they could only do so much when remaking those old models. I personly find the game very nice looking. It's art style really fits the theme of a game about an anamorphic blue hedgehog.\n\n-Gameplay\nThere are three diffferent gameplay types across the six characters. On the Hero side Sonic: Speed levels, Knuckles: Treasure hunting, and Tails: shoot em ups. On the dark side Shadow(best character N/A): Speed levels, Rouge: Treasure hunting, and Eggman: Shoot em ups. The speed levels are what they sound like, you are racing through the level as fast as possible while trying to rack up points from killing enemies, collecting rings, and most importantly a time bonus. The treasure hunting levels you are searching for the objects, either the master emerald pieces are keys. Even though they are not designed for speed they still go reasonably fast. Finally the shooting stages. I find these fun, the goal is to reach the end of the level while racking up as many points as possible, mostly by hitting as many targets as you can at once. The controls are smooth, the level designs are nice, and each level has 5 different different missions. If you have an A rank on every mission and have all 180 emblems you will unluck a special stage.\n\n-Chao Garden\nThis is the main reason that I, and many people still play this game. You get your own Tomagachi pets that you can raise how you want to. They have 5 different stats, Swim, Fly, Speed, Power, and Stamina. Which stat you chose to focus on will determine the look of your chao when it evolves (I'll explain that later). YOu upgrade your chaos stats from emerald shards you get from killing enemies, and animals you find throughout the levels. You can also make your chao a Hero, Dark, or Neutral which leads to even more combinations of how your chao can look! Chaos have 2 evolutions. Their first evolution the go into a cacoon and hatch as whatever aligment they are with their focused stat before the evolution. Their second evolution is a gradual thing that happens over time after the first. You choose another stat that will change how your chao looks slightly. This leads to so amny combinations that I honestly have no clue about how many it could be.\nYou might be asking "why should I even raise these things." They are cute, and you can race them in the chao races. You can also have them involved in karate if you have the DLC. Raising these cute little critters might sound really stupid and lame, but it's actually quite fun I really reccomend it.\n\nConclusion-\nI would easily recommend this game to anybody who likes 3D Sonic games, Platformers, or even just for raising the chao. The only downside of this game for me is that it really hasn't aged well. I personally haven't found any glitches(except for the truck floating over me in the first level like WTF.)\n\nOverall I give this game a 9.5/10, I love this title and I hope you will to!\n","January 24","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While fun at times, turning is slow and locking on emits a very high pitched sound.\n\nKnuckles and Rouge's stages have you finding emeralds and keys in a variety of maps; however, unlike in Sonic Adventure DX where you could chase all the emeralds in the map, you can only go after one item at a time. The camera also takes a while to adjust to in their part of the game.\n\nThere is also an extra chao garden where you can raise chao pets, get animals and drives (capsules) from the main game to raise their stats, and have them compete in a several competitions such as racing and karate. There are also several upgrades (some mandatory while others are optional) that you can find throughout the game that will aid your character's abilities.\n\nDespite a few confusing parts in its story, I found it to be pretty enjoyable overall.

While playing through the story, I spent a lot of time raising my chao, which I may or may not have become slightly obsessed over, and even after finishing the story, I still played with them, and played on multiplayer mode with a friend, which was also really fun and enjoyable.\n\nPlaying the game again, now on PC, was very nostalgic, the graphics seem to remain unchanged, and the controls are rather awkward without a controller, but even when I was little, the thing that impressed me was the story, which suddenly doesn't seem as in depth, but it's still very good, specially the ability to see the whole thing from both the perspective of the good guys and the bad, taking into account each character's specific interests.\n\nThe levels are very well designed, with a good mix between puzzles, action and running around being awesome, graphics are rather outdated, but the game is playable, and has a good difficulty curve.

In this Sonic game, you play as the Hero and Dark side, as Sonic, Knuckles and Tails on the Hero side, with Shadow, Rogue and Dr. Eggman at the Dark side. You complete levels, as you progress farther and farther into the world. Each completion earns a emblem.\n\nBesides the regular beating of a level, there are three other options in each level to complete for which you also get an emblem, up to a total of 180 emblems throughout the entire game, which will unlock an extra zone. Personally I achieved approximately 178 emblems on the Dreamcast, and I never got farther than that.\n\nThis game, is and will always be, my favourite Sonic game of all time. To all who are planning on getting this, it is a definate recommendation.

There is also a Dark Story you can play. I haven't played it yet, so I can't tell anything about it.\n\nBut there is really not much sequel over it, since you're not taking part in the old story.\n\nSonic Adventure 2 is a great game, and has a lot of great elements from Sonic Adventure DX. But it could be better.\n\nIn Sonic Adventure DX, you're having a little "world" to travel in. Compared to Sonic Adventure 2, you're just going from mission to mission. It was more fun to see this world and actually try to find the missions.\n\nMost of the levels is very fun. The Knuckles levels could be really hard as always. Maybe too hard this time.\nThe levels you're playing as Sonic and Tails is battle levels. You will have to destory enemies and do what you'll have to do.\n\n\nOtherwise is the game really great, and if you liked Sonic Adventure DX, you will like this game too.\n\n8/10\n","April 2","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Steam version of this controls terribly unless you use a controller. No matter what console you use, the game has a usless camera, music that is WAY too loud [but admittedly very catchy], unpredictably spazzy character animations merciless and cheap enemy placement, and way too many glitches that induce rage-quitting while also making the game more fun to explore. speaking of exploring, you get almost none of it with the most linear stage design ever. on top of all of that, only a fraction of the game is enjoyable. Sonic and Shadow's "Action Stages" are the only fun ones, of which there are only 10 in total, Dr. Eggman and Tail's mech stages had potential, but were ruined by tank controls cheap enemy placement, and ear-piercing sound effects, and Knuckles and Rouge's treasure hunting stages are an unplayable mess. The plot and cutscenes are for the most part engaging and fun to watch, despite it being inconsistent. The graphics look good, especially the framerate. Overall, this game is terrible, but thanks to the few good points and the excellent stage select that lets you replay only those good parts, I just have to recommend Sonic Adventure 2.","May 26, 2015","true","78.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To this day, it's still a pretty solid game. It receives a lot of flak for its plot holes, cheap enemy placement, and poorly done camera, but I don't think that stops it from being fantastic. I haven't seen a lot of games that execute a fast paced 3d platformer as well as this one. There's a pretty decent amount of content. There's a lot of variety between the levels, especially with the 3 different types of stages. One of these stage types, treasure hunt, is commonly looked down upon. Some of the stages are frustrating, but I actually found it to be a really enjoyable mode. As long as you aren't going for speed, hunting around is a really nice change of pace that still works within the scope of the game. Adding to the content is a slew of minigames and activities. The game features a Chao Garden which allows you to raise Chao with drives and animals you receive from playing the main game. The integration with the normal levels is done very well, as it doesn't force you to grind a poorly done minigame. There is a lot to do with Chao, and they serve as a pretty great distraction from the main game, which can easily slow down once you've beaten all the levels multiple times. All things considered, it's a great game with plenty to do, but whether or not it still is a great investment in 2015 is something you'll have to find out for yourself.","November 28, 2012","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","6"

Gameplay\nthe Gameplay is split into 3 styles: speed,treasure huntinghunting, and mech shooting. with the speed you take control of Sonic and Shadow and the levels are centered around that aspect so it isn't as open as adventure 1 but still the levels are a TON of fun.Treasure hunting (I couldn't think of a better name) is where you take control of rouge or knuckles and you go through these large stages climbing and gliding to collect 3 things that the stage needs in random places and I really like this style. Now mech shooting in this you play as eggman and tails targeting onto as many robots as possible for the best score and again this is a style I like.\nMusic; The music is awesome I love\nGraphics: the graphics are really good (look these last 2 aren't that important to me so I keep them to a minimum.\nStory: ehh Don't want to spoiler it to much to sumarize just look up The Completionist's video on SA2 and get the story from there.\nOverall 8.5/10 Great game","January 29","true","63.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will admit there are various plotholes within the story. I don't really care though because the story itself it entertaining probably only beat out by the originals. I also love when characters cut each other off in cutscenes! lol The story basically without spoilers is that Eggman wants to take over the planet using a weapon of mass destruction as bait. On his journey he finds his grandfathers greating accomplishment, Shadow the Ultimate Life Form. Shadow shows eggman the Space Colony Arc and how to use the weapon. Rouge then shows up and offers to help them find the chaos emeralds. On the hero side Sonic escapes from the government, he was arrested because he was mistaken for Shadow. After running around ramped for a while he finally gets captured so tails has to free him. Knuckles is searching for the pieces of the master emerald like always. When they catch wind of Eggmans plans They follow him to space to try and stop him. I made all of that very vague so I didn't spoil all that much.\n\n-Graphics\nThey aren't the best because game is decently old, and they could only do so much when remaking those old models. I personly find the game very nice looking. It's art style really fits the theme of a game about an anamorphic blue hedgehog.\n\n-Gameplay\nThere are three diffferent gameplay types across the six characters. On the Hero side Sonic: Speed levels, Knuckles: Treasure hunting, and Tails: shoot em ups. On the dark side Shadow(best character N/A): Speed levels, Rouge: Treasure hunting, and Eggman: Shoot em ups. The speed levels are what they sound like, you are racing through the level as fast as possible while trying to rack up points from killing enemies, collecting rings, and most importantly a time bonus. The treasure hunting levels you are searching for the objects, either the master emerald pieces are keys. Even though they are not designed for speed they still go reasonably fast. Finally the shooting stages. I find these fun, the goal is to reach the end of the level while racking up as many points as possible, mostly by hitting as many targets as you can at once. The controls are smooth, the level designs are nice, and each level has 5 different different missions. If you have an A rank on every mission and have all 180 emblems you will unluck a special stage.\n\n-Chao Garden\nThis is the main reason that I, and many people still play this game. You get your own Tomagachi pets that you can raise how you want to. They have 5 different stats, Swim, Fly, Speed, Power, and Stamina. Which stat you chose to focus on will determine the look of your chao when it evolves (I'll explain that later). YOu upgrade your chaos stats from emerald shards you get from killing enemies, and animals you find throughout the levels. You can also make your chao a Hero, Dark, or Neutral which leads to even more combinations of how your chao can look! Chaos have 2 evolutions. Their first evolution the go into a cacoon and hatch as whatever aligment they are with their focused stat before the evolution. Their second evolution is a gradual thing that happens over time after the first. You choose another stat that will change how your chao looks slightly. This leads to so amny combinations that I honestly have no clue about how many it could be.\nYou might be asking "why should I even raise these things." They are cute, and you can race them in the chao races. You can also have them involved in karate if you have the DLC. Raising these cute little critters might sound really stupid and lame, but it's actually quite fun I really reccomend it.\n\nConclusion-\nI would easily recommend this game to anybody who likes 3D Sonic games, Platformers, or even just for raising the chao. The only downside of this game for me is that it really hasn't aged well. I personally haven't found any glitches(except for the truck floating over me in the first level like WTF.)\n\nOverall I give this game a 9.5/10, I love this title and I hope you will to!\n","January 24","true","31.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would play the hell out of this so much. I remember my hour count being over 200 hours on this cause I played it so much. My review may be biased a little bit, since Sonic the hedgehog has been a main staple of my life, but I'm only a bit biased for good reasons.\n\nFor one, the soundtrack....OOOhhh the soundtrack is just gorgeous. I listen to music from this game on a daily basis, and I'm not lying about that either. It really defines the name "Sonic" when you listen to the music from this game, and all I can give and say about it, is a HUGE A+.\n\nThe story of the game is just amazing as well. I loved being able to choose either the Hero side or the Dark side. It was interesting to see how both of the stories kind of tied in together, and it had a relatively good pace on the story too. The game didn't feel too long, yet it didnt feel short either. Of course we then have the Final Story mode, but I wont go into details on that if any of you don't want spoilers.\n\nThe physics are meh. It's really the only downfall I have with this game, each time I play it. They can be a bit jittery, and the camera angle can just be horendous. The gameplay overall I guess is just, okay. It's not really spot-on perfect, but at least it's "playable" in some areas.\n\nThe character are good too! The lip syncing is again a little off, but at least the voice acting did improve a lot from the previous game in the series. Though, the characters that I felt were a little more enjoyable were Rouge the Bat and Shadow the Hedgehog. Of course, they are the new character in that game, but they just seemed a lot more interesting than Tails, Knuckles, and the others. Sonic is just himself, but that's honestly all Sonic is. He's just a snarky smart ♥♥♥.\n\nOverall, this game has a 9/10 in my books. Physics and some of the gameplay being the only flaws out of the whole game. It was a very good sequal, and looking back on my reveiw for this right now, I can see why a lot of people tend to be biased with this game. It was (for some of us), a major part of our childhood, and some people even grew up with this game. It definately was a good game then, and it still is a good game now.\n(Though maybe some aread don't hold up to date in these times, but that's besides the point. lol)","December 1, 2015","true","42.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Gameplay\nthe Gameplay is split into 3 styles: speed,treasure huntinghunting, and mech shooting. with the speed you take control of Sonic and Shadow and the levels are centered around that aspect so it isn't as open as adventure 1 but still the levels are a TON of fun.Treasure hunting (I couldn't think of a better name) is where you take control of rouge or knuckles and you go through these large stages climbing and gliding to collect 3 things that the stage needs in random places and I really like this style. Now mech shooting in this you play as eggman and tails targeting onto as many robots as possible for the best score and again this is a style I like.\nMusic; The music is awesome I love\nGraphics: the graphics are really good (look these last 2 aren't that important to me so I keep them to a minimum.\nStory: ehh Don't want to spoiler it to much to sumarize just look up The Completionist's video on SA2 and get the story from there.\nOverall 8.5/10 Great game","January 29","true","63.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a nutshell, this game is frickin' awesome. No joke. For as long as I can remember I've played Sonic Adventure 2 BATTLE on the GameCube, but I was young and careless so I accidentally ruined the game by leaving it out and the dog stepped on it. Oops. Anyway, I was super psyched when I found out that I could buy and download the game on my laptop, so I did. By the way I am not dissapointed at all whatsoever. One thing you should know however is that this is a steam version of the original Sonic Adventure 2 for DreamCast, and not the GC version. Don't let that stop you from buying it though because it is almost exactly the same. In fact, you can even find Big the Cat in (I think) every stage, unlike the GC version. You can even raise little chao!!!\n\nLittle tip though, because this IS a Sonic game it will be fast and a little difficult to control at first with the whole WASD controler Lol but you do get the hang of it eventually. However, when I was attempting to clear Hard Mode with Rouge at Mad Space (raise your hand if you hate that level) I still haven't been able to do the screw kick (I think that's the name of the kick, but it may be something else) to get the last shard of the Master Emerald because it is VERY difficult to make a circle and press the button for 'b' with WASD controls...\n\nOther than that minor detail, it's a great game that had me hooked when I was younger and even to this day.

Many things you can do in this game: from taking care of your Chao, to completing missions and doing different tasks within each mission. Gameplay is solid, besides the few crappy camera angles that the game gives you from time to time and the reaccurance of several enemies. The boss battles bring another dimension to this game from the music to figuring out how to bring them down.  This game has so much to offer, cinematics are decent, audio sync during cutscenes is bad but the audio quality is good and it does not deter your attention away from the task at hand. Chao diversity is incredible (a game all on its own) A, "Chao" is a little creature that you have to raise, sort of like a baby. They come in different colours, and moods (Neutral, Hero, and Dark.) You have to collect different coloured vials that reflect stat boosts for your Chao, from the enemies you kill. Overall, the game is beautifully crafted and should be played by gamers throughout the world. I have enjoyed playing this game so much of the years and still do. I am yet to complete the game 100%, which takes a good amount of time and effort. 10/10 would play again and again.","December 10, 2013","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That is because when you run it it first starts a launcher, and that is where you enable the controller. Start the executable directly after doing so, though, and the controller works fine in-game without needing to access the launcher again. Just make sure your controller is on if it's a wireless controller before you start the game. Press the Xbox button in the center of your controller after starting the game and you should be greeted with the Steam overlay (Big Picture) or the Game Bar (Windows 10), which means the game has detected your controller. If the game does not accept your controller inputs, then it did not detect your controller and you must start the game again in order to redetect it.\n\nThis is one game that I always wanted. You have no idea how hard it was to set up a Dreamcast emulator or a GameCube emulator just to play this game. When I found out about the Steam release I had to buy immediately.\n\nThe multiplayer is tons of fun, the Great Clement even called it the best multiplayer ever in a Sonic game. When my sister wants to play with me more often than not this is the game we play.\n\nOne thing that this is sadly missing though is online multiplayer (the multiplayer is splitscreen only). That is a huge let down.\n\nSure this shows its age with glitches and stuff but you can let those slide, right?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePoke/recommended/213610/","ThePoke","Poke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePoke/","201 products in account","EDIT SINCE SOME PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY READ THIS: The Chao garden runs just like the Gamecube version did except for the lack of link functionality. Also, there are a few odd bugs that seem to be system specific. Some get in the way quite a bit (having half of the screen sometimes covered by a levitating truck in city escape when I run the game on integrated graphics being one).\n\nPerformance is very good with the exclusion of a few massive slowdowns I have experienced in time trial, however these slowdowns were only experienced when  was running integrated graphics. Oh, and I'm running my integrated because thanks to the game's awful launcher system, it's slightly difficult to run it on my dedicated graphics (I'm on a laptop).\n\nMy review of the game in general aside from port differences: It's a very buggy sonic game that you must learn the kinks of to enjoy, the story isn't great, they removed the overworld segment from adventure 1 (this is a good thing), but they have more varying gameplay types (of which my favorite is the treasure hunting).  Bosses are hit-and-miss, and this game is mostly held together by nostalgia.... and chao\nYes, as a side project they decided to involve a chao raising minigame, and it carries the rest of the product. I bought this simply because I wanted to raise chao again. The chao make the in-game levels more fun to explore and learn about and give the actual game a purpose to replay (for the ring count and items to give to chao).

Otherwise, it's still a fun game. Still a fun storyline.

OH HO HO, WELL ♥♥♥♥ YOU, TOO, SEGA! DO YOU WONDER WHY YOUR FANS DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE YOU ANYMORE? ♥♥♥♥!!!!!!!!!\n\nThat being said, I can only describe Sonic Adventure 2 like this:\n\nImagine ordering a steak. You have one, little juicy part of the steak surrounded by a lot of fat and those parts nobody really likes. Normally, you'd just get another steak, but the part of this steak that isn't disgusting fat is actually SO DELICIOUS that you don't want another one. Also, you actually have to get through this fat in order to enjoy the actual steak part fully, and with a much more delicious flavor.\n\nThat's basically what Sonic Adventure 2 is like. This game is considered the last truly good Sonic game, and while I've been pretty indifferent to the Sonic series as a whole, I can see why people say that.\n\nAs I said, I've been pretty indifferent to the Sonic series as a whole, but this one inparticular has held a place in my heart for many, many years. Why? It's not because of the somewhat okay-ish Sonic/Shadow levels, where you just go fast. It's not because of the tedious Knuckles/Rogue stages where you find 3 peices of the stupid Chaos Emerald. It's not the unecessary Tails/Eggman levels where you just run through a linear path spamming the attack button to shoot everything in your way, and it's not because of the 2-player mode (I had a Gamecube and no friends growing up. :c) and it's not because of the kart racing, either. It's....\n\nT H E   C H A O   G A R D E N\n\nIt's not very often that a game is praised this much because of a relatively small feature, but it's AWESOME! It's basically a virtual pet game that has a lot of depth into taking care of your Chao (the blue creatures with those yellow balls over their heads) and watch them go through a surprisingly deep life cycle. I've spent COUNTLESS hours in the Chao garden, and I can honestly say that it's worth the $10 purchase just for that feature.\n\nThe rest of the game, like I said, is kinda meh. But once you get past all of that, the Chao Garden will keep you coming back, even after you beat the game! THIS is what we want, Sega. Not a barley functional Kinect game with characters we don't give a crap about riding hoverboards. WE WANT MORE OF THE CHAO GARDEN!\n\n4 McLovin's out of 5","September 9, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

You remember? The best sonic game on the Game Cube!\n- partial controller support (after heavy modding to get it to work with a wired XBOX 360 controler)\n- If you buy it on sale like I did, both the main game, DLC, and the fustrations that come with it can be yours for under $5!\n\nHoly block of text version:\n\nI had this game on the game cube back when this game first came out. Let me get this out of the way now: if you have a GC and access to amazon buy that version, not this POS. First of all this is a god awful port. Before I could even play it I spent the better half of a week learning how to write the code to get around the launcher, becuase if you have an intel GPU this game doesn't recognize any resolutions and will give you an error negative int error. Next issue: you have to disable everything steam to get this game to not freeze on the title screen. Next issue, now you must choos either a consistant frame rate of 30 or a game with synced sound. If you choose to have a refresh rate of 30 (something you need to mod in your launcher code: see issue one) then every cut sceen is out of sync and every "frame perfect move" you need to do for speed running is not possible. If you choose to go with 60 fsp (the normal locked speed) then you will have periods were the game laggs to below 15fps and times when it speeds up well past 60 to the point of being uncontrolable. However, the cutscenes are flawlessly synced and and speedrunning clips are possible (you know after trying to speedrun at 15fps... which isnt going to happen). Lastly: If you like City Escape, don't worry they manged to screw that up too! The entire upper half of the screen is covered by a glitched floating trolley! Oh and to ad the icing on the cake: The "Battle" part of the title is DLC. so they want another $3 from this glitched mess.\n\nWay to ruin my favorite childhood game SEGA!","February 13","false","4.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","5"

The Chao garden is also a decent distraction.\n\nCONS: Just like Sonic Adventure, this game has aged like milk. The Tails/Eggman levels are slow and a bit unresponsive at times, and the Knux/Rouge levels are a scavenger hunt. The extra missions can be very tedious at times, and annoying to do. The camera whips around like a drunkard, often times away from where you have to go. The hit detection's a bit wonky in the speed stages as well. The worst though, is without the Battle Addon, the game has no audio, about 75% of sounds missing, and lags horribly.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS: Have fun grinding all of the levels out for A's.\n\nFINAL: I can't in full consciousness recommend this game.

Lastly the levels were really well designed and always made you feel fast.\n\n","July 13, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And this is one of those few. The plot is exceptional with a couple show-stopping plot twists at the end (I won't spoil them, you'll have to play it for yourself :)), the controls are great, and the level design is AMAZING. The bosses are amazing (some can be annoying, though), and it has plenty of replay value with the Chao Garden, and you should try to A-rank every stage (which of course I can't do XD) My only problem with this game might be with the grind rails in the final rush stage. But aside from that, this game should NOT be missed. It beats out the first game in the series by far.\n\n\nOverall, I give this game a 10/10.","December 15, 2013","true","53.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sonic Adventure 2 expands upon the original Sonic Adventure, adding bigger levels (although sadly no more open world), more upgrades to find, more characters to play with, a tamogachi inspired Chao raising garden, Kart races, and even a 2 player racing and battle mode if your inclined to take part in.\n\nIf all of this sounds too good to be true, well you should be happy to know that won't be disappointed as long as your expecting a game that by all accounts isn't perfect, but its just so unique and has that Sega Dreamcast era charm and personality that it might as well be and you definitely be hard pressed to find similar games to it even to this day.\n\nNow lets get down to all this varied gameplay I was talking about earlier, in this game there are specifically 3 different types of gameplay styles which include Sonic/Shadow which their levels are all about going fast, bouncing on enemies, and is generally the type of gameplay you would expect from a Sonic game. You then have Knuckles/Rogue levels where they have to have find Chaos Emeralds shards or keys in a level by listening to a radar to see if they are close and then either straight out picking it up or digging in the ground for it or even just killing an enemy. Last, but not least is the Tails/Robotnik levels which are essentially updated Gamma levels from Sonic Adventure 1 where you will go through a level locking on and shooting lots of enemies while trying to get to the end. It's also worth mentioning that going through story mode you will also sometimes come across the usual boss fights and even the occassional racing mini-game to add even more to the mix.\n\nNow to the part where about half of you will love and the other will hate and thats the Chao Garden. You see, throughout each level in the game, you pick up these colored objects and even small animals that you can take back to the garden and feed to your chao to make it level up in a certain attribute which you can take to compete in races or even battle it out karate style! They also evolve and change depending on how you grow them and there are some secrets even to be had with them. The part however that some people do not like with this big part of the game is that it is essential to raise a chao to have high stats and do all the races/battles so that you can get 100% completion which unlocks a special level and raising chao is not a fast endeavor.\n\nAll in all, the game itself is great. The port however...has a few kinks to work out with getting it to work with Fullscreen mode now with a new patch, but is semi-easily fixed, so if you can get it working then you should have a great time with the game and this game will take you quite a while as well if you try to get all the Emblems and A-Ranks as well, so there's that, but if you just try and finish the story mode by itself with some or little chao raising then your looking at a solid 10 hour game.","December 16, 2013","true","25.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

In this game however, the two sides follow one main story, just from different perspectives. There is the Hero side and the Dark side, each side has 3 playable characters with different game types of their own. The game types are Adventure Stages (Sonic/Shadow), Action Shooter stages (Tails/Eggman) and Treasure Hunting stages (Knuckles/Rouge). Though this game is, in my personal opinion, a very enjoyable game, it shows some aging with minor bugs/glitches throwing you through platforms and between the tiniest gaps, but that happens rarely. If you haven't got any ver. of this game yet (Dreamcast or Gamecube), I would highly recommend getting this as it is available here on Steam at a verry reasonable price. If you purchase the SA2 Battle DLC you will get additional game modes for the Multi Player section AND a new mini game in Chao Garden.","November 25, 2013","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is a very meaty challenege for anyone trying to 100% the game. I did it on PS3 and really enjoyed it.\n\nGameplay can be broken down into 4 parts:\n\nSpeed: You're Sonic/Shadow you run through levels. The best part of the game.\n\nShooting: Tails/Eggman are in mechs and you have a lock on lazer cannon the idea of each stage being how many enemies you can target at once before losing the lock, pretty neat once you get into it.\n\nTreasure Hunting: Knuckles/Rouge fly around contained levels looking for 3 of something. You can climb, glide, dig, it's fun to just run around as them really.\n\nThere's also a few mods out that are pretty great and I highly recommend hitting up Sonic Retro for them.\n\nNow for a controversial opinion: Chao Garden sucks.\nA lot of people will try to tell you the chao portion is something special. It was easily the poorest portion of the game by far. It's tedious, it's annoying, it's not deep or interesting it's a time waster through and through.\n\nEssentially all the enemies in the game drop animals or energy cores that you can give to the chao leveling them up so they can better race or fight. The racing and fighting however are slow paced affairs you have no impact on other than cheering making the whole affair a massive time waster.\n\nIn short: Mechanically solid game with an excellent aesthetic, it has a tacked on time waster you need to 100% the game but you can ignore it really.","July 8, 2015","true","51.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/213610/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","TL;DR:  It's a bit rough around the edges, but Sonic Adventure 2's a pretty fun 3D action platformer and solid entry in the Sonic series.\n\nI'll start this by saying I bought as a part of the Sonic Everywhere bundle on Amazon a while back for $15 on sale.  Steam has the same bundle for $30 normal price.\n\nSonic Adventure 2: Battle.  Oh man, I remember this from the Gamecube.  It was my first actual 3D Sonic, since I entirely skipped the Saturn and Dreamcast.  I never thought I'd see it on PC, honestly.  This is a port of a port, but that's not all that bad.  I'll try not to mention anything related to the 2P mode or the Battle DLC additions.\n\nThe game is split into three sections told by two separate stories between Hero and Dark.  Sonic and Shadow are the typical high-speed platforming/rail-grinding/Homing Attacking gameplay where you get to the goal ring.  Tails and Dr. Eggman travel through levels in bipedal mechs and blow things up with some platforming elements.  Knuckles and Rouge climb, glide, and dig through large levels to find three Master Emerald shards or keys or so on.  The stories happen at the same time but are told by different sides, and by beating both Hero and Dark stories, Last Story is unlocked and through that the true ending to the game is revealed.\n\nGameplay is different from Sonic Adventure in that instead of merely choosing one character and using only that character until their respective ending, you pick between good and evil and you go through that side's stages alternating between Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles for Hero and Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge for Dark.  There are no Adventure Fields to traverse between levels, so the flow goes between Action Stages and story events with some boss battles sprinkled in.  Every character fights his or her opposing-side match one or more times in a boss fight, though there are some third-party battles too.\n\nWhat I Liked\nThere is a good bit of content though you don't need to see it all to beat the game.  Every stage has five missions, though you only beat the first mission as you go through the story mode.  The other four missions are optional challenges, and every mission gives you a rank based on score.  Emblems are also awarded for clearing missions and other tasks, and getting all of them is a pretty big undertaking since there are 180 of them.  Getting all A-ranks in every mission is something a challenge-seeker would enjoy.  There is a leaderboard feature so you can compare scores between everyone or just friends.\n\nThe music is catchy.  Some of the songs during the stages have lyrics which doesn't really detract from the experience.  I hope you like rock and some hip-hop, though.  All of Knuckles' stages have lyrics present, a couple of the Sonic and Shadow stages have them, all of Rogue's stages have female singers present.  All six characters have theme songs too which pop up during the story, and if you want to listen to those or any other song in full, there's a sound test in the options, so that's nice.\n\nChao Garden.  Chao are cute little creatures found in Chao World separate to the story that you are tasked with hatching and raising, albeit optionally unless you want to get all of the game's emblems.  While only able to crawl around like an infant at first, by feeding them Chaos Drives and small animals found in the stages, they will grow and take on features of the animals.  Raised Chao can be entered in races, though you have no direct control over their performance outside of a little boost to speed.  There is some incentive to keep going back to the stages to get items to raise the little creatures and it is kinda nice to take care of them and watch them grow and change...and stop drowning in the little pond.\n\nWhat I Didn't Like\nThere is a lack of polish with this port, and at times they seemed to fix a couple of things but leave some others strangely untouched.  For example, the "wow, he's fast hey it's not his speed he's using the Chaos Emerald to warp" line during the story bit when Sonic first meets Shadow IS given a gap, but the "you're not even good enough--"  "I'll make you eat those words!" before Sonic and Shadow's first fight is not.  The mouths move with the Japanese audio and not with the English which results in some cutting off at times, or people talking after their mouths stopped moving.  Rouge's eyes actually went through her eyelids a few times, and the perspective of one scene put both of Amy's eyes on the same side of her face.  I didn't really have much problem during the gameplay, barring a couple of instances where hitting a boost pad the wrong way resulted in an unavoidable death.\n\nI did not like the treasure hunting stages.  Even Tails and Eggman's sections I enjoyed even if they're not very Sonicy.  I dunno, I guess a big problem I have is that the radar only tracks the first item in a list.  You can be standing right next to a shard or something and the radar won't tell you unless it's the first in a line.  I understand why it's set up that way, but that's a problem I have with the core game as opposed to this port.  The stages are wide open and there are hint monitors, but they boil down to just hide-and-seek at best and pixel hunting at worst.  There are some interesting features like dodging the invincible enemy in Egg Quarters or adjusting the water level in Aquatic Mine, but at this point I'm just ranting.\n\nAnd speaking of ranting, Mad Space!  Just pretend I said "treasure hunting but worse" here.\n\nClosing\nSo in closing...it's an old game.  The graphics are visibly dated, the camera is a bit of a chore to fight against, and the story can be kinda hit-or-miss.  But I had fun with it, even for it not being new to me anymore.  I put in just 15 hours to clear the game this time around, and that was with giving plenty of time to Chao Garden.  Besides, this is the best game if you're prone to rolling around at the speed of sound, or if you feel apprehensive at the thought of somebody wanting to play with your emarools.  $10 ain't bad, and it's been cheaper before to boot.\n\nBattle DLC\nWell, since Steam won't let me review a DLC that integrates into the main game, lemme go ahead and paste what I was going to say there.\n\nThe Battle DLC is, as you could guess from the name, related to the 2P versus mode found in the original Sonic Adventure 2.  It does alter a few things in the single-player version of the game, though I don't know if those changes carry over to the version of the game without this DLC.  It's a little hard for me to tell since I got them both at the same time.  This link[info.sonicretro.org] mentions features added to the Gamecube version from the Dreamcast, so I dunno if the same applies on the PC or not.  That said, let me cover a bit about the DLC here.\n\nFirst things first, this is local split-screen only.  This works better for some people, but unfortunately it doesn't for me.  Great though if you have a roommate or sibling and you don't need a separate machine or copy of the game (and DLC) to play against them.  There is a 2P mode in the base game, but this DLC expands upon it a bit more with additional characters and stages.  And Chao Karate is there if you're the type who got into raising the Chao, and it too is another mostly stat-based affair like the races are in the base game.\n\nThere's not really a lot I can say.  Assuming all of the single-player changes were made to the base game, you aren't really missing much by skipping this.  It's better if you know you'll play with somebody else, or if you really want to have some additional Chao events to participate in.  2P mode can be fun, and you get to use special moves on your opponent as you get rings, so it's not just a cut-and-dry copy of the regular SA2 gameplay.","February 25, 2014","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/213610/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","TL;DR:  It's a bit rough around the edges, but Sonic Adventure 2's a pretty fun 3D action platformer and solid entry in the Sonic series.\n\nI'll start this by saying I bought as a part of the Sonic Everywhere bundle on Amazon a while back for $15 on sale.  Steam has the same bundle for $30 normal price.\n\nSonic Adventure 2: Battle.  Oh man, I remember this from the Gamecube.  It was my first actual 3D Sonic, since I entirely skipped the Saturn and Dreamcast.  I never thought I'd see it on PC, honestly.  This is a port of a port, but that's not all that bad.  I'll try not to mention anything related to the 2P mode or the Battle DLC additions.\n\nThe game is split into three sections told by two separate stories between Hero and Dark.  Sonic and Shadow are the typical high-speed platforming/rail-grinding/Homing Attacking gameplay where you get to the goal ring.  Tails and Dr. Eggman travel through levels in bipedal mechs and blow things up with some platforming elements.  Knuckles and Rouge climb, glide, and dig through large levels to find three Master Emerald shards or keys or so on.  The stories happen at the same time but are told by different sides, and by beating both Hero and Dark stories, Last Story is unlocked and through that the true ending to the game is revealed.\n\nGameplay is different from Sonic Adventure in that instead of merely choosing one character and using only that character until their respective ending, you pick between good and evil and you go through that side's stages alternating between Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles for Hero and Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge for Dark.  There are no Adventure Fields to traverse between levels, so the flow goes between Action Stages and story events with some boss battles sprinkled in.  Every character fights his or her opposing-side match one or more times in a boss fight, though there are some third-party battles too.\n\nWhat I Liked\nThere is a good bit of content though you don't need to see it all to beat the game.  Every stage has five missions, though you only beat the first mission as you go through the story mode.  The other four missions are optional challenges, and every mission gives you a rank based on score.  Emblems are also awarded for clearing missions and other tasks, and getting all of them is a pretty big undertaking since there are 180 of them.  Getting all A-ranks in every mission is something a challenge-seeker would enjoy.  There is a leaderboard feature so you can compare scores between everyone or just friends.\n\nThe music is catchy.  Some of the songs during the stages have lyrics which doesn't really detract from the experience.  I hope you like rock and some hip-hop, though.  All of Knuckles' stages have lyrics present, a couple of the Sonic and Shadow stages have them, all of Rogue's stages have female singers present.  All six characters have theme songs too which pop up during the story, and if you want to listen to those or any other song in full, there's a sound test in the options, so that's nice.\n\nChao Garden.  Chao are cute little creatures found in Chao World separate to the story that you are tasked with hatching and raising, albeit optionally unless you want to get all of the game's emblems.  While only able to crawl around like an infant at first, by feeding them Chaos Drives and small animals found in the stages, they will grow and take on features of the animals.  Raised Chao can be entered in races, though you have no direct control over their performance outside of a little boost to speed.

It's a fabulous little game to play.  This game was released as Sonic's 10th Anniversary game, and Dr Eggman has found Space Colony ARK, capable of destroying an entire planet. The game focuses on two storylines, the Hero and the Dark storyline. Truth be told, if you want the game for the story, it's The Dark Story you want. The Hero story is basically the standard juke against Eggman. What I will suggest though is be careful of the camera angles. They can stuff you over. But it's still a DAMN GOOD GAME.

There is a very meaty challenege for anyone trying to 100% the game. I did it on PS3 and really enjoyed it.\n\nGameplay can be broken down into 4 parts:\n\nSpeed: You're Sonic/Shadow you run through levels. The best part of the game.\n\nShooting: Tails/Eggman are in mechs and you have a lock on lazer cannon the idea of each stage being how many enemies you can target at once before losing the lock, pretty neat once you get into it.\n\nTreasure Hunting: Knuckles/Rouge fly around contained levels looking for 3 of something. You can climb, glide, dig, it's fun to just run around as them really.\n\nThere's also a few mods out that are pretty great and I highly recommend hitting up Sonic Retro for them.\n\nNow for a controversial opinion: Chao Garden sucks.\nA lot of people will try to tell you the chao portion is something special. It was easily the poorest portion of the game by far. It's tedious, it's annoying, it's not deep or interesting it's a time waster through and through.\n\nEssentially all the enemies in the game drop animals or energy cores that you can give to the chao leveling them up so they can better race or fight. The racing and fighting however are slow paced affairs you have no impact on other than cheering making the whole affair a massive time waster.\n\nIn short: Mechanically solid game with an excellent aesthetic, it has a tacked on time waster you need to 100% the game but you can ignore it really.","July 8, 2015","true","51.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vosse/recommended/213610/","Vosse","BONKERS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vosse/","428 products in account","A great game that has held up to the test of time.But a good port with unresolved issues that Sega has never patched\nRecommended Reading http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Sonic_Adventure_2\n\nI LOVE SA2, I was obsessed with this game back when it came out on the DC and later the GCN. My friends and my brother and I all played this endlessly together. It's not perfect, but is a testament and standard to how 3D Sonic games should all be designed.\n\nAs imperfections are present in the game, so too are they in the port itself. It's just shy of being great.\n\nPros Retains the 60FPS performance profile of the original games\nSupports arbitrary resolutions of varying aspect ratios. (Multimon setups require Flawless Widescreen FlawlessWidscreen*dot*org)\nAll gameplay and some cutscenes now support native HOR+ Widescreen (Remaining Cutscenes are 4:3\nUI and many textures have been updated and look very clean\nFull Controller and Keyboard support with a switch in the launcher for both.\nSupports Controller and Keyboard Icons\nSupports different Keyboard layout standards. AZERTY,QWERTY,etc\nFull Remapping of all buttons and keys\nStill supports local MP and content from the GCN Battle release\nPerforms flawlessly when it works for you\n\n_________________________________________________________\nCons\nGame logic is tied to 60FPS. This means if you drop under 60FPS (Would take a low end machine to do so) the game slows down rather than dropping frames. It also means if you have a Variable Refresh Rate Monitor or a High Refresh Rate Monitor, the game will be sped up over 60FPS.\nSo these users *NEED* to set their monitor to a 60hz RR when playing the game. A simple Framerate cap will not suffice because...\n\nThe Steam Overlay, Riva Tuner Statistic Service OSD (From MSI Afterburner), and external Framerate limiters (RTSS,DXTory,GeDoSaTo,etc) will cause the game to crash after the Sonic Team logo appears. (You need to disable the Steam Overlay and add "Sonic2app.exe" to RTSS and set the "Application Detection Level" to "None" )\nWhen this happens, you have to Crtl+Alt+Del to open Task manager and kill the .EXE. Because...\n\nGame does not support Alt+F4 to quit. So you have to Alt-Tab out, or go through the tedious menus in game to quit.\nCreating a game profile for Sonic Adventure 2 in Nvidia Control Panel or Nvidia Inspector and enabling FXAA will ALSO cause the game to crash at the Sonic Team Logo\nGame does not support any kind of Anti Aliasing on it's own. See below section about AA.\nThe "Battle" content from the GCN release is tied behind a DLC Paywall.\nThe launcher always opens with the game. You can bypass it by following the guide "Bypass Launcher" under "Essential improvments" in the linked page at the top.\nFor some people the game will not launch unless in windowed mode. I myself have never had this problem. YMMV.\nNo Texture Filtering setting.\n\nThe Sound Effects are INSANELY loud and painful to listen to. Overall the Audio balance is extremely poor, which is something that is carried over from the original releases I think. Something they SHOULD have fixed in this release or at the very damn least, put in Volume Sliders.\nCurrently the only way to fix it is to extract and modify the sounds of the game directly. Which can be tricky for some.\nLuckily someone put together a file with all the sound effects lowered by 50%!\n\n=Download this archive= https://mega.nz/#!MFQwlYJS!fwOdyFTe5JFm9z0ENmFFFjkLT0R7DoYBDkSBBUP9FNs\n=navigate <path-to-game> "resource\gd_PC". =\nReplace the folder "MLT" with the one from the archive.______________________________________________________________\n\nNow, it seems like the Cons are much larger than the Pros. So one would assume the recommendation would be "NO".\n\nBut to the contrary, most of them are easily solvable (Now that is) and it doesn't affect enjoyment of the game once you get it up and running and deal with some of the small unavoidable quirks.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nTweaks For Nvidia UsersIt is highly recommended you use Nvidia Inspector for Nvidia Users. As it allows greater control on a per profile basis than NVCP. Allows more options to be changed and is FAR more responsive than the sluggish NVCP.\n\nNvidia Inspector setup guide\nDownload the latest version here http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/nvidia-inspector-download.html - In the future if the application needs to update. It will tell you so and automatically download any updates.\n\nSave it to a location that you can permanently use. Extract it.\n\nWhen you open it for the first time you will be presented with http://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/InspectorMainScreen.png\nClick the Tool icon next to the "Driver Version" Box to open up the driver profile settings.\n\nYou are now greeted with this screen and the default "Global Home" Profile\nhttp://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/Inspectorbasicexplan.png (You will want to create a desktop shortcut as noted)\nThese are the settings that globally apply to ANY given application. It is VERY IMPORTANT that you minimize what you force Globally to only basic things such as Texture Filtering settings and Performance Mode.\nHere is my Global profile, I suggest you match it  (Remember to hit "Apply Changes" afterward)and change nothing else.\nhttp://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/GlobalProfile.jpg\n\nSonic Adventure 2 does not have a profile in the Nvidia Drivers by Default\nFollowing the notes on this picture http://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/Inspectorbasicexplan.png\nCreate a new profile named "Sonic Adventure 2"\n\nYou are now ready to tweak Anti-Aliasing and HBAO+\n*If you matched my Global Profile settings, you will not need to change any Texture Filtering settings. As the new Profile will match the global setting by default of HQ 16xAF\nSonic Adventure 2 does not require a special Hexidecimal Flag in order to force Anti Aliasing.\nIt supports forcing of essentially all AA modes.\nMSAA,TrSSAA (Transparency SuperSampling),SGSSAA (Sparse Grid SuperSampling), OGSSAA (Shown as "YxY Supersampling" modes.Ordered Grid Super Sampling.) and HSAA (Hybrid-Sampling. Which is a combination of MSAA,OGSSAA,TrSSAA and SGSSAA)\n\nMy recommendation if you have a decent GPU is to use "16xS [Combined: 2x2 SS + 4x MS]". This is IMO the best performance/quality ratio option. It's not perfect, but the average user won't notice the remaining issues.\n\nTo see references and how to apply AA settings in Nvidia Inspector see this guide here (That I am the maintainer of)\nhttp://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=357956\n\nFor HBAO+ there are two working flags - 0x00000012 (Subtle) and 0x00000013 (Strong)\nBoth have some minor bleeding, but add quite a bit of depth.\nTo see references and how to apply HBAO+ in Nvidia Inspector follow my guide with images here\nhttp://forums.guru3d.com/showthread.php?t=387114","September 29, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Horrible port.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Sonic Adventure 2, but saying this port isn't optimized is a grand understatement.  It almost feels like SEGA just threw the Dreamcast or Gamecube game into either a horrible emulator or an unfinished emulator.  You can tell just from the opening cinematic in the Battle DLC.  The grind particles, names, and many other effects are way off sync from what's actually going on in the cutscene.  Another problem with emulations is one that can't always be fixed, especially with video/audio intensive games like SA2: the framerate.  I understand that SEGA did emulated games on Steam before, such as Sonic 3 and Knuckles, as well as other companies, such as SQUARE ENIX's Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII, but these games are excused.  Why?  Because they are nowhere near as video (or audio) intensive as the game in question, and therefore, there is no lag (and if there is, then why are you even using your horrible computer to play games?).  And I have no problem with framerate drops, usually, as long as it isn't drastic.  The thing about this game's low framerate is that it doesn't skip frames to make up for it; it slows the whole game down.  If you look at the timer in the top-left, you may notice that 1 second seems unusually long.  This is a problem, especially in a game that is all about speed; however, I do have to give credit on one thing: the music and sound effects don't slow down with the framerate, which is very nice.  It would be even nicer if the rest of the game didn't slow down!  All in all, I love this game, but seriously, get the Dreamcast version or Gamecube version, or if you have a PS3 or XBOX360 with internet, you can buy them off of their respective online shops, bringing up one more question: why do those ones run so well?","June 18, 2014","false","33.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Awesome level design, catchy-as-♥♥♥♥ soundtrack, 6-character campain on two sides with the best story of any Sonic game, and the best Chao Garden, which is a full-fledged game in its own right. I often wonder why they never brought Chao Garden back after this. Probably because it couldn't get any better than this.\n\nAnd the Battle DLC expands on the variety of multiplayer modes, which actually aren't bad either.\n\nSonic Adventure 2 is ♥♥♥♥ing in my ♥♥♥♥ing top 5 ♥♥♥♥ing favorite ♥♥♥♥ing games ever ♥♥♥♥ing made.

Sonic Adventure DX has definitely aged poorly in a few places, but this game makes Sonic Adventure feel like a timeless classic. The camera is way too tight; trying to get a view of what's around your character is next to impossible in some areas. Cutscenes are downright bizarre - characters talk over each other, and I think they outsourced the localization job to the lowest bidder. The Knuckles / Rouge gem finding missions are atrocious - you're constantly fighting the camera; the gem radar has now been changed so you can only get a hint for the location of one emerald at a time. I wouldn't have thought this game was that awful, until I got to the Knuckes portion of the final sequence of the game - imagine that bad camera combined with one of the worst water levels I've ever played.","July 15, 2015","false","14.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This is the sequel to the TRUE revolutionizing 3D Sonic Game on the DREAMCAST, which was by the same name without the 2.\n\nTwo: All the DLC does is unlock the bonus feature of 2P battle that was introduced in the re-make on the Gamecube, so there's nothing really lost by not getting it unless you have two controllers and want to play with somebody else in this glitch-fest.\n\nAnyway, as for my quick little review. While the game itself is stellar, or should be, the PC port is a hunk of dung that I'm glad I didn't buy for it being Sonic Adventure 2. I luckily got it as part of a bigger bundle, and honestly the levels and controls are extremely glitchy on this port and I find myself dying many times because of hitting invisible walls, having my speed inverted, falling through ground, or just plain having my screen turn black for 10 seconds while the video dies despite the game continuing on, which ends up desyncing the audio/video.\n\nAs much as I really, truly want to recommend this game, after playing a little bit of it, the glitchiness is just too much to handle. I'm going to try playing some more later, but honestly it's hard to play a game you love when the mechanics of it are as broken as this. If at all possible, play the Gamecube port, and/or the Gamecube port of Sonic Adventure (DX). I'm honestly not sure if it's worth it to play this if you've never played Sonic Adventure (2/battle) before since I feel it will leave a terrible impression upon the two games.\n\ntl;dr\nThe game itself is amazing, but the engine is broken on PC. People who think this is the ground breaking original 3D game are ill-informed.","April 24","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Today, i can say that this game sucks. Period. To be honest, i had much more fun with the original Sonic Adventure, except for fishing. That game had 6 gameplay styles, but this one has only 3. Sonic and Shadow stages are easily the best part of the game, and the reason many love this game. However, some stages aren't much fun to play, because of the challenge. There's nothing wrong with that, but as a whole i prefer the Sonic stages of the original Sonic Adventure. Do you remember the E-102 Gamma shooting stages? They were only okay, but at least it's story was short. Here, Tails (which i also liked on the original) and Eggman stages are the same, but much longer. It gets boring and repetitive after a while. And the Knuckles stages are back, but are worse for two reasons. First, the radar only shows one piece at a time, so the stages take much longer to complete. Secondly, Rouge stages are the same, so you get more of this bad design choice. Some reviewers said that because only the Sonic and Shadow stages were good, they only enjoyed 33% of the game. But no. The bad stages take a longer time to complete, so i would say that only 20% of the story playtime was fun. On the plus side, the hub world is gone and the bosses are better. The story is improved but still sucks, and the soundtrack for me is much worse than the original. To get all the emblems, you need to replay the stages over and over and over again. It's a chore. But there's more good stuff. The Chao garden is much improved, and this time i actually cared a bit for it. And there's also 2-player multiplayer, which is actually good. I also need to mention that the Steam version is much better optimized that the original mess of Sonic Adventure DX on Steam, only playable with a mod pack. There's also leaderboards if you enjoy that kind of thing. But the "Battle" content is locked behind a DLC purchase, a terrible practice by SEGA. Despite everything, in the end i can recommend this game on sale if you enjoyed this game back in the day or if you want the best chao garden version available. For newcomers, i recommend to stay away from this game and play the original Sonic Adventure DX instead if you must choose between one of them.

The 'optional' DLC is required in order to collect ALL the emblems within the game.\n\nin other words, you can't finish the game or even enjoy it to the fullest extent without coughing up an extra couple of bucks or cents (if it goes on sale)\nThat's pretty f^cking absurd.

I am sorry to all of you who loved this game, but there are so many things that are horrible about this game, that i am surpirsed everyone is ok with it. Now before i go on, i would like to say that this is coming from a massive Sonic the Hedgehog fan and i haven't played it during the days it was released, so because of so much praise it got, like saying that after this game, Sonic's reputation went downhill, but, in my honest opinion, i believe it started with Sonic Adventure games. Anyway, the 1st problem i have with this game are the controls. They are as clunky as hell. Everytime i try to run really fast on Sonic/Shadow section, chances are that i will either hit something or i will fall of the platform and die, because of how uncontrollably fast they are going. The 2nd problem i have with this game is the Camera. That thing has a mind of it's own. I mean, sometimes you can control it by yourself and sometimes it just locks in one position, and when you want to look around to see if there are enemies or not, you will have a bad time. The 3rd problem is the level design. Actually, for the most part, it's good, but there are sometimes unpredictable obstacles that you will be losing life a lot in those parts (Especially at the ARK levels). So, overall, it was more frustrating to play than fun, and i wouldn't recommend to someone who is not a Sonic fan, and even not to Sonic fans who haven't played this game yet.","February 23, 2015","false","15.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Theres alot of unique things in video games, this one just happen to be raising a Chao. Raising a Chao would probably be similar to raising a child. Making sure it's healty goes to school and making it eat. Not only that you can send them in races! All bosses are not Dr. Eggman as most Sonic games are. Some of the bosses are characters some crazy monsters and some times Dr. Eggman.

But the nice gameplay and story make up for that. The Chao Garden is finally back and luckily didn't change at all, making the game be so much more addicting.\n\nThe game runs pretty smooth on a simple Laptop, making it way better than emulating it (Althrough you can't sprint through City Escape with Eggman anymore via Action Replay...)\n\nAs a title originally releashed in the early 2000's. Comparing the graphics with other titles like Sonic Generations isn't the best idea. But the game will always simplify the character model whenever you get to far from the camera or in Multiplayer. Making the game SO ugly at times.\n\nThe 3 unique ways to play is a step back from the prequel's 6. But without the annoying fishing stages, this is not bad at all. The Sonic and Shadow stages are the typical 'Reach the goal' levels. While Tails and Eggman get the Mech levels originating from Sonic Adventure's E101 Gamma's stages. Knuckles and Rouge hold the treasure hunt levels, which are way more interesting now with every stage holding something special.\n\nOverall, I totally recommend this game for true Sonic fans and 3D platforming gamers.\n\n","April 15, 2014","true","54.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The plot is a little bit janky at times, and the cutscenes could use a lot of work (oh god... the lip-syncing), but the core gameplay is still very enjoyable. There are a few different game modes as well, so the gameplay tends to remain interesting and avoid repetitiveness.\n\nHowever, the one part of this game that always brings me back is the Chao Garden. Chao are small, cute creatures you can raise as sort of a side-game, but the garden has a huge amount of depth to it. You can raise and take care of them, enroll them in kindergarten, give them toys to play with, put them in races, they can interact with each other on their own accord, play instruments in bands, and the list goes on. You can raise them to be good or evil, and their appearance and personality will be reflected by it.\n\nIf SA2B was a staple of your childhood, then by all means pick it up; it's the exact same game you know and love. If you haven't experienced it before, I would still recommend it (if not just for the Chao Garden), but just be aware that it's far from perfect.","September 30, 2014","true","45.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Slowly eroding nostalgia and stockholm syndrome are the only things that keep me playing his 3D outings.\n\nYou probably already know whether or not you're going to buy Sonic Adventure 2 before you read a review of it. You most likely played it when you were younger, or are a fan of later Sonic games curious about his past. Reading this might not change your mind, but I can assure you of one thing: This game has not aged well. Sound familiar? Sonic Adventure 1 is the same way, and many of its mistakes apply to the sequel as well.\n\nSonic Adventure 2 once again tells the story of Dr. Eggman's attempts to rule the world, and Sonic the Hedgehog and co.'s attempts to stop him. This time he's got a plan that might actually work - He's stolen Dr. Evil's "laser" from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and is holding the world hostage. What for isn't made clear. It's not money. He wants power. But what he plans to do with it once he has it isn't really addressed. Helping him is Shadow the Hedgehog, a genetically engineered super hog created by Eggman's grandfather, and Rouge the Bat, a government spy/jewel theif who doesn't know the meaning of "conflict of interest". The good guys just follow them around trying to stop them. No dreams or ambitions of their own.\n\nThe overall story, when written in a few non-sarcastic sentences, I really like. Seeing that story unfold is like watching a Mystery Science Theater movie without the riffing. The acting is either bad, or passable by accident (my favorite scene is when Eggman hurts Sonic, and Tails lackadaisically says "I will never forgive you for this"). It's also localized poorly. Often it seems characters are saying whatever is in their mind at that moment rather than having a coherent conversation. There are many instances of odd wordings and sentence structure. The technical issues SA1 had in its cutscenes have been reduced ever so slightly, but many still remain. Lip synching is all over the place. Characters talk over each other, and sometimes, themselves. They make odd movements while talking to one another. It *is* better than SA1, but it's not what I'd call good.\n\nThe game is separated into Hero and Dark storylines. There's no overworld this time, just cutscenes and action stages. Each side has three characters who are basically clones of each other. Sonic and Shadow run through linear levels quickly, with lots of platforming and occasional puzzle solving. Eggman and Tails use mech suits with guns to shoot their way through too-complex platforming stages. Knuckles and Rouge search for Master Emerald shards (or other items) in non-linear levels that quickly become too large for their own good.\n\nSonic Team did seem to learn a few lessons from SA1. Sonic and Shadow's levels are laid out like racetracks. Minimal side paths and long straight stretches where you can run freely. These are easily the most fun levels to play. Camera issues are minimalized by not having lots of corners and objects in the way. But they added some new design issues. Both can do a Light Speed Dash to zip along a line of rings. It helps you get around, but it shares a button with both a somersault attack and the spin dash move. There will be many, MANY times where you'll go to spin dash and will instead be flung at some nearby rings, or try to use some rings to get over a gap and will instead somersault right over the edge. Sonic also has a bounce move that shares the same button, so a mistimed Light Speed Dash in the air means instant death. Technical issues with basic movement are still shared with SA1 as well, so slight variations in ground height or angle will cause energetic spasms in your character.\n\nTails and Eggman play much like E-102 Gamma did in SA1. They shoot their way through levels, using a targeting laser to mark enemies for destruction. For some reason I don't mind the sound much, but it does make a high pitched tone whenever you do this, which will be all the time. The level layouts themselves are more complex than the hogs', and this does not work in their favor. Sonic is supposed to be about going fast, and the mech suits Eggman and Tails inhabit move slow. The later levels often have closed gates that you have to locate the switches for before you can proceed, which makes them take even longer. Basic movement is still riddled with technical issues. Early on you gain the ability to extend your jumps by hovering, but lightly brushing up against a wall will cause you to plummet downwards instantly, causing many accidental deaths. Camera problems are also in full effect when in tight areas. The camera does not get stuck nearly as often as it used to in SA1, but it often manages to find just the wrong angle for the jump you're trying to make or the enemy you're trying to target. That said, it *IS* better than SA1's camera. It feels like they actually played the levels and tried to choose somewhat reasonable angles.\n\nKnuckles and Rouge's levels are scavenger hunting affairs that mirror Knuck's levels from SA1. These are my least favorite levels to play because of one stupid design decision: the proximity detector that used to show any item of interest in range now only shows one at a time. It artificially inflates the time you spend wandering around, and I hate it. This doesn't matter much for the first few levels, since they are small. But both of their final levels take place in space, and are huge. If you haven't been playing these levels since you were 13 like I have, you can easy spend 45+ minutes in them, going in futile circles until you reset the level in the hopes of getting better item locations (like I did when I was 13). The level designs are often confusing. One of Knuckles' levels takes place in an underground mine and involves changing water levels to open paths to different mine shafts. The tight spaces are great for getting the camera blocked in bad angles. Rouge's final level takes place in space near planetoids that will gravitationally attract you. It's like Mario Galaxy, but worse. Both characters are capable of gliding, and climbing on certain walls. There's a new attack in this game, the Drill Dive, that lets you dive downwards while gliding, and it's actually pretty good. It looks cool, can destroy enemies effectively, and lets you dig in the ground for items.\n\nThe Chao garden returns, and it has the same system as in SA1DX. I don't really care for the Chao garden, but it doesn't detract from the main game, so I don't mind it existing.\n\nUpsides? Like most Sonic games, the music is pretty good. Live & Learn, and especially the vocal theme to Sonic's first level, City Escape, are songs I own outside the game. Sonic's Metal Harbor stage also has a ska-like track that is my personal favorite from the game. Even when not memorable, the stage music always matches the stage environment well. *Sometimes* the graphics can be impressive, mostly when they use actual photographs as textures, though the polygon count is still pretty low. The final boss battle, featuring Super Sonic and Super Shadow in space trying to stop a giant lizard from destroying the Earth while Live & Learn plays is genuinely exciting. If you really memorize Sonic and Shadow's levels, you can actually have some fun with this game. Their abilities make sense with the level design, even if they're all mapped to one button.\n\nYou already know whether or not you're going to buy this game. SA2 has more fun potential than SA1, but can also be much more frustrating. They both average out to being pretty bad games. I still play them, because I'm a true Sonc fan. I stick with him through the bad times. Nostalgia aside, I wish there were more good times to be had with him.","January 30","false","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicbomb77/recommended/213610/","sonicbomb77","◢kris◤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicbomb77/","1832 products in account","I'll admit this is one of the most nostalgic games for me. I occasionally listen to the OST still to this day and might leave the soundtracks on repeat for hours at a time. I'm also part of that group of people who thinks this is one of the better 3D games for Sonic, mechanically. It's true that newer Sonic 3D games have improved on many of the unique issues that arise when developing for a unique character like Sonic, but the gameplay in SA2:B just feels the most controllable. I admit the breakneck speed effects of more recent Sonic games feel more genuine to the character, but this one game still feels the most controllably fluid for me. Then again that might just be more of the nostalgia showing.\n\nUnfortunately, I think this is one of those games that you don't really like until you've played through it a couple times and have a good feel for the quirky camera and the level layouts and upgrade collections - and a game controller (you really ought to play this one with a game controller).\n\nThe story wasn't all that amazing to me as a kid and holds even less value to me today - however the premise of Sonic still having an actual attitude and characters having personality archetypes that relate to their traditional reasons for existing, beyond filling a role as "[acquaintances of the protagonist character]," is something that makes me perhaps a bit dissapointed with the direction of the franchise since such days of the past.\n\nAll the Sonic fandom crap aside - Generally speaking, I'd recommend this game to anyone with a game controller and a thing for arcade games.\n\nEdit: After playing this on PC with an xbox controller for a few hours - I hate to say it, but it handles much worse than I recall from the Gamecube. So much easier to get caught off-course and have a sudden momentum halt just from gently swiping a polygon the wrong way. It's definitely not as enjoyable as my nostalgia recalls. I may set up the gamecube again someday to compare how the GC version plays against the PC version - it definitely feels different in a bad way. In addition to the controls feeling really over-sensitive, the game has several audible and visual glitches that are new to me - most occuring during the rouge/knuckles maps where you tend to observe the maps in detail while seeking the hidden pieces.","February 21, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soniclinkz/recommended/213610/","soniclinkz","Soniclinkz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soniclinkz/","63 products in account","I would say this is a great Sonic game, but it does have it's problems which I will strike up later.\n\n---Overview---\nOut of every Sonic Game I have ever played, this one in paticular just didn't seem to cross my mind to playing it til now. You know what I mean, Tails riding in a mecha armor suit and... Eggman as a playable char?? This game was sending me all kinds of negative signals and I ceased to playing it until this day.\n\n----Presentation----\nAfter playing SA1, alot of things were noticably changed. Instead of 6 seperate storylines (not counting final stage) we have only 2 story modes. That seemed ok to me at first and I started the Heroes story without question. The one thing that cought me by surprise was that 3 characters had their own seperate stages and they were all diferent and unique. I'm looking at you, Knuckles. Those haunting missions appear so frequent that it makes me wish on why they just didn't make those stages optional.\nAs you get closer to the end of the game, the stages get more difficult and... weirder. There will be a time where you will be in a tight situation and you have no lives, so good luck there.\nThe cut scenes look like an imrpovemt from SA1 in my opinon. Lip syncing is more accurate and... Tails, that mouth! What have they done to you? Alright, I agree the characters looked a bit weird talking in SA1 but atleast some of the graphic look of most characters in that game had actual mouths. Here it's just him using his whiskars or something, it's weird.\nI think so far the only favorite part I like in this game is Sonic's first stage, "Escape the City," which is one of my favorite music tunes, it never gets old.\n\n----Overall----\nAlright I think you all know what I think of this game at this point, but it's not a bad game. It's just one of those games you may need to sit down and get used to. Not an On-The-Go game like SA1 was. SA2 will challange you and I just don't think this game is the way to go for newcomers. The camera angle in some areas can get so obnoxius that it may just drive you insane if not get very anoyyed by it.\n\n----Personal Score----\n4.5/10","February 1","false","8.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The knuckles/rouge stages are tedious, but the worst has got to be the tails/eggman stages: these are so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying to play with a keyboard, because the game is clearly not optimised for it.\nThis is a BAD PORT of a once good game, and i honestly cannot reccomend it.

Although there are some flaws.\n\n- Audio isn't bad, but sometimes the audio comes in too early or late. And sometimes it just outright cuts out (Ex: The police at the end of the cutscene after Sonic's first boss battle) There are also times where the speaking has little feeling or feels unnatural. I know it's a game about a super-fast blue hedgehog, but the audio could be a LITTLE better (even if is one of the first fully voiced Sonic games).\n\n- The controls for the PC could be a bit better. I understand that you can map the controls; that's what I did. Still, the PC controls don't work as well for certain aspects. For example, although it isn't terrible, Sonic and Shadow's homing attacks are a bit hard to control. You have to have almost exact aiming with WASD keys (if that's what feels natural for you; otherwise, it's whatever keys you mapped moving to) to be able to hit the target you want. Also, I feel the movement of the mouse could've been utilized for Tails/Eggman missions for aiming their laser.\n\n- While the Knuckles/Rouge missions aren't the worst levels in gaming, I'm going to be blunt: I hated them. They were too repetitive and annoying. I feel a better concept for these missions could've been created other than "the emeralds are lost, use your radar to track them down in the least time possible". Maybe they could use their respective punch/kick attacks to actually, you know, destroy enemies (which were actually kind of rare to find in these missions) and use their glide abilities to get to other platforms to reach the end of the level? Maybe not that, but something more engaging than a boring treasure hunt mission.\n\n- Multiplayer being DLC. Need I say more? Crappy decision, Sega. Same goes for the PS3/360 versions.\n\nOther than these, the game was great. Decent story, fun gameplay (most of the time), unique bosses, and AWESOME music.\n\n7.5/10","July 21, 2014","true","44.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I'm sad that I can't like this game.\n\nSonic Adventure 2 is considered one of the greatest 3D Sonic games of all time. I have played it before and I thought it was good. However, I recommend you play the game on anything BUT PC. First of all, the controls are only labled during the part when you can change your resolution, which was unacceptable for me. If you can even get the game to play, you'll soon know that the controls are aweful, especially for PC. Even after changing them multiple times, the game was very hard then what I remember playing it on the gamecube. In fact, the controls are SO BAD that I can't even get past THE FIRST BOSS OF THE GAME. Not only that, but the games crashes and freezes, which is very frustrating. I recommend that you use a controller IF YOU CAN EVEN FIND ONE THAT IS COMPATIBLE. As far as I know, the only controller that works with this is the Xbox 360 Controller, which means if you don't own an Xbox 360, you'll have to pay something like $50 to just play this game okayer. Hopefully, they decide to make more controllers compatible in the future, but I highly doubt that SEGA will add that into a future update. Until then, I recommend to not get this game on PC, but on something like the gamecube or Dreamcast.","June 14, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game use to be fun back in the day of the Dreamcast and the Nintendo GameCube days. Now that I've gotton older, I have noticed so MANY FLAWS with this game it's unreal.\n\nLemme list some positives first though\n\nPositives+Fantastic Soundtrack (One of the best in the series)\n+2 Player Battle mode is pretty fun\n+Now it's in Widescreen HD\n+Big the Cat is gone!\n+The levels are pretty damn memorable (unless you don't play the game a lot)\n+Chao Garden is much better than the first\n\nWell that seems like good things right? Eh... not really. There's many problems I just can't stand about this game.\n\nGameplayI loved the story in Sonic Adventure DX! But in this game...... not so much. I do like the introduction of Shadow and Rouge, but Shadow is just a simple clone of him. He controls almost exactly the same as Sonic, and I just feel like I'm playing some re-skin fanmade game of Sonic. Oh and Rouge? Same thing! She controls exactly like Knuckles to! And Tails? My GOD REALLY SEGA? He's the same as Omega! The "Dark" characters are basically the same. They just feel like re-skins. I get that's what SEGA was going for, but it feels SO LAZY.\n\nAnyway Sonic and Shadow have the speedy platforming parts of the game\nKnuckles and Rouge have the Treasure Finding parts of the game.\nTails and Omega have the "SHOOT EVERYTHING BECAUSE I HAVE A ROBOT THAT IMMA FIRIN MA LAZAR" parts of the game.\n\nWell here's the problem. If I only wanted to play as Sonic, I could just play as Sonic. In this game I'm FORCED to play as the other characters just to complete the Hero or Dark story. Really? In Sonic Adventure DX, I wasn't forced to play as anyone I didn't want to! All I played as was Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy. I wasn't forced to play as Omega (but I did anyway) or Big the Cat. Why change that? Like honestly? SEGA, tell me why?\n\nAnother major problem with this game is the trasure hunting stages. It may be "minor", but it's FRUSTRATING AS ♥♥♥♥! In SADX, the blinker would indicate whenever your near a Piece of the Master Emerald right? Well it does it in SA2, but ONLY IF IT'S IN ORDER. WHY?! I'll be right next to a god damn Piece and it won't blink? Wanna know why? Because it's not in order. What the hell SEGA? Another thing is Tails and Omega. They both use to be fun! Now they're not! Instead of doing basic platforming with Tails, he's now gone Super Mega Death Christ mode and now shoots the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything like Omega did in SADX. I'm sorry. But that only worked for Omega and NOT Tails.\n\nThe only fun playable characters in the game is Sonic and Shadow. SEGA really screwed over the other characters which I'm REALLY angry about. Also why is 2 player Battlemode DLC if you can't even play it online? The Nintendo GameCube came with it for free in Sonic Adventure 2: Battle. So why not this game?\n\nThe StoryIt's mainly like every generic sonic Story. Stop Eggman done. Oh by the way, Shadow exists now. GG no RE.\n\nStagesCity Escape and Metal Harbor are the only fun and memorable stages in the game for me. Every other stage is forgettable, because the other stages have extremely terrible enemy placement and unfair platforming sections. Absolutely disgusting.\n\nPC PortWhile it's not the best, it's... decent. It has full controller support, runs at 60 FPS with no slowdowns, and looks pretty decent for the HD remake. Only problem is the game crashes when I play in my Fullscreen Native resolution. Why does it do that? I'll never know. It's not optimized that great to say the least. Also if you press any key on your keyboard while in controller mode, it'll switch back to the keyboard like in Sonic Generations and you can't switch back unles you restart the game.\n\nFinal Verdict / TL;DR Sonic Adventure 2 is an overrated piece of ♥♥♥♥ that didn't help make the Sonic Adventure series better. Poor enemy placement, unfair platofmorming sections, boring treasure hunting and robot shooting gameplay, and a not-so-good- PC port. The soundtrack is amazing and Sonic is a blast to play as, but the rest is trash and unenjoyable for me. Save your money and go buy Sonic 3 and Knuckes, Sonic Generations, or better yet the ORIGINAL Sonic Adventure. Keep in mind, this is coming from a long time Sonic fan! I've been playing Sonic games for all my life and this is one of the most disappointing games in the franchise! Yes you can argue all you want about Sonic 06 and Sonic Boom, but that still doesn't change my opinion that I don't like this game!\n\nFinal Rating 4/10","April 21, 2015","false","1.6"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SegaUranus/recommended/213610/","SegaUranus","Virtua Sanus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SegaUranus/","231 products in account","I have many problems with Sonic Adventure 2, but my largest is that the art direction in general is much worse than most previous Sonic titles and the level variety is very weak. You have city levels, mechanical levels, forests, pyramid levels (which are very creative) and not much else, whereas Sonic Adventure 1 had a little of everything players could want. I understand why they removed the overworld from the first game as well, but I think it was a mistake abandoning the concept completely. The music is not as good as the first game's soundtrack either, but it is enjoyable enough; I especially enjoyed how each character's levels had their own genre of music too. The story is simply a mess, but is easy to ignore.\n\nAs a pure 3D platformer the game is largely mediocre. I feel the Sonic levels are more 'solid' in design than any other 3D Sonic title, but everything else feels significantly worse and less fun to me than the first Sonic Adventure. Most zones are significantly larger and infinitely more elaborate, making the scoring for the hardcore fans potentially more enjoyable, but much more frustrating and tedious for those interested in casual play.\n\nI would recommend the game to people who are interested in revisiting levels to improve their rank and finding various secrets though. I think the scoring system in the game is brilliant and very undervalued by many. No Sonic game since has had such a balanced, thoughtful scoring system. The Chao raising is very addicting if you allow yourself to get absorbed in it too.\n\nI do enjoy Sonic Adventure 2 and have fond memories of unlocking everything on the SEGA Dreamcast version back in the summer of 2001. I could never do it again (or would I want to), but I am very nostalgic of those times.","June 15, 2015","false","11.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","9","21","2","3"

What do i mean by bad gameplay? Heres an example\n\n\nSonic & Shadow Levels:  the only real reason to play the game and is what a 3d sonic game should be like\n\nTails & Eggman Levels: The point and shoot part of the game where they use mechs to destroy enemies.  Which make a very annoying beeping sound when targeting enemies and slows the game down\n\nRouge & Knuckles Levels: The worst part of the game and is a Hide & Seek part of the game where you have to look for pieces of the master emerald which has a radar only detecting one specific emerald at a time unlike the first game where the radar would track any emerald that was close to you. But however the levels for them in this game take so long to beat you would get tired of these levels really quick.\n\n\nThe only good things about this game are\n\nThe Chao Garden\n\nThe Soundtrack\n\nThe Multiplayer\n\nBut other than that the games pretty much garbage.

IMO, it is the bar-none most overrated Sonic game of all time.

The game itself is fantastic and one of the best games of the dreamcast/gamecube library.\n\n-Some of the cutscenes are still pre-rendered. And by that, I mean they came straight from the Dreamcast. Numerous times, I saw some of the cutscenes run in 4:3, while the gameplay is 16:9. That shows Sega laziliy ported this game.\n\n-Camera controls feel off. You rotate the camera by pressing RT or LT(I use an xbox 360 controller). However, pushing RT, rotates the camera to the left of your character and vice versa, and the camera will only move horizontally. A handful of times, the camera will point at a fixed angle.\n\n-Except for adjusting resolution, there are no graphical settings at all.\n\n-The same goes for audio settings. The only settings available are language spoken and mono/stereo.\n\n-You cannot change the interface language while running the game. You could in the Dreamcast and Gamecube versions, so why take that out?\n\n-The music is untouched from the original DC/GC version, which I find to be a mixed feeling. It's nice that they kept all the songs, and listening to the familar tunes brings back memories, but an updated soundtrack would've been better.\n\n-The multiplayer battle mode is DLC, which is a huge red flag in my book. Battle mode was available from the start in the GC version, and should be available from the start in this version.\n\n-Customizable menu has also been locked out as DLC. Is Sega turning into Capcom now?\n\n-In some of the cutscenes, the lip sync is a bit off. Again, Sega is being lazy with the port.\n\nI recommend getting this game only if:\n1. You've never played it before\n2. You don't have a Gamecube or Dreamcast\n3.

Remember when you were in middle school sitting at the lunch table, and you were wolfing down your peanut butter and jelly sandwich as quickly as you can to maximize your time at recess? Remember smelling a faint note of rat ♥♥♥♥ wafting in from the corner like a fart-filled Hindenburg, waiting to immolate your sinuses? Remember turning to meet your nasal assassin, only to see half a cafeteria of barely-pubescent corpses strewn about the tables? One last child stood amongst the carnage and held the herald of your salvation in his hands. The cold barrel of his father's gun met your lips as his hand trembled incessantly... your first kiss. You thought it'd be more romantic.\n\nThe least important of these questions is whether or not he decided to pull the trigger. The only question that remains after the police tape goes up is: why? Why, when so much of life was ahead of us all, would he decide to close the curtain so soon?\n\nSonic Adventure 2 is a comprehensive study in the stimuli that cause these tragedies. What must a child have witnessed to decide that candy and gameboys were no longer in his taste, but that blood would make a fitting substitute? The awful level design of this game leave the mind feeling trapped.

The hedgehog's swan song is both as fun and bad as you might remember, with improved graphics and achievements. Enjoyable for nostalgia value, but off-putting for newcomers.  It hasn't aged well.\n\nThe writing is F worthy.  The voice acting is ♥♥♥♥-poor and badly lip-synced.  For some reason the game still has moments of slow-down and doesn't even run as well as Sonic Generations.  The plot doesn't matter.  We start with sonic skydiving for reasons unkown pursuing a "fake" hedgehog... who's clearly a hedgehog.\n\nThe removal of SA's hub world is a huge pro, sonic was always more fun streamlined.  Sonic stages are exhilirating, Tails's is decent and not a hack redo of Sonic stages like in SA.  Knuckles stages are frustrating.\n\nMusic is fantastic, pretty much the one thing Sega has continued to shine in.  Some stages have weird choices though, rapping about chaos emeralds during knux stages... I don't even\n\nIf you want it, get it on sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/recommended/213610/","epeternally","Princess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/","2703 products in account","Sonic Adventure 2 is a bad game. Full stop. The music is great and there's some sections, particularly the justifiably iconic City Escape level, which capture a nice since of speed that can be interesting, but the fickle camera and controls (I'm baffled by the fact that these actually got worse from Sonic Adventure rather than better), awkward character movement, complete lack of polish, repetitive Tails / Eggman levels, and outright torturous Knuckles / Rouge levels bring everything that is good about this game far, far down. Even the Sonic / Shadow levels, inarguably the game's highlight, aren't consistently enjoyable.\n\nStripped of the novelty, hype, and impressive graphics that Sonic Adventure 2 possessed when it first came out on the Dreamcast, it becomes obvious that this is a janky and poorly designed platformer which doesn't hold a candle to Super Mario 64 or its 2D predecessors. And despite this being a sequel to an iconic platformer, those platforming bits - which are the best parts of the game even if that isn't saying a lot - only make up less than a third of your play time. The entire rest of the game is worse and you spend far too much time doing things that have no relation to traditional Sonic gameplay. The later Knuckles levels can drag on for in excess of 35 minutes, making the game's absolute worst moments also it's most drawn out ones. At least the mech levels are marginally less glitch prone than Sonic's running ones. Not as if that's saying much. On the plus side of things, with some belated updates, the port is actually pretty solid even if it doesn't fix the game's original problems.\n\nNostalgia purchasers only. Grab Sonic Generations if you're looking for a modern Sonic game that is actually pretty good (and, as a bonus, doesn't feel the need to constantly force you to play as anyone but Sonic).","June 11, 2015","false","1.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

After that, the game quickly becomes terrible. The tails/eggman and knuckles/rouge stages are completely boring, filled with tedious platforming and combat. The Sonic/Shadow stages, while sharing the same complaints, are better designed than the other stages. However, they also have the homing attack, which will either function or screw you over. Every time I died I felt it was the game's fault.\n\nThere are also cutscenes within the game, which have some cringe-worthy voice acting and dialogue tied in with out-of-sync talking animations. The game's plot, for some reason, has some dark themes that you wouldn't expect from a sonic game. The soundtrack is the only redeeming feature for this game, having some memerable tracks if you aren't playing a knuckles/rouge stage (seriously, hip hop?)\n\nHowever, I haven't even talked about the monstrosity that is the pc port. First off, the pc port, despite saying so in the controls section of the launcher, does not support xbox 360 controllers (I assume the same goes for every other gamepad), which means you have to play through a 3d sonic game without a gamepad. I've also encountered many minor bugs along with forum users suggesting that there are major bugs that I haven't encountered.\n\nPros\nSoundrack (Trust me and we will escape from the city!)\n\nCons\nEverything else\n\nIn short, even if you enjoyed the gameplay as a kid, DO NOT BUY THE PC VERSION! My hatred of the gameplay may just be opinion, but the buggy mess that is this pc port is unacceptable.

It was good for it's time but it has aged pretty poorly. It's not a BAD game, but it's not a good game anymore either really, just okay.\n\nFirst of all, I have to mention that this game only works with Xbox controllers, which is a pain.\n\nNow to the game itself. The main bulk of it consists of three gameplay types. Sonic and Shadow have the Sonic gameplay you'd expect, Tails and Eggman are in mechs. If you've played Sonic Adventure, it's similar to E-102 Gamma's levels. Finally, Knuckles and Rouge search for treasure. There's also Chao Garden (the most addictive part of the game, if you're into raising little critters), and the kart racing. Hoo boy, It's the WORST part of the game, I have no idea why Sonic Team thought it was a good idea to begin with.\n\nTowards the end of the game, all the final levels have stupid buggy control issues. Sonic/Shadow's homing attack glitches out far too much, and Knuckles/Rouge's space levels take far too long to complete.\n\nDespite this negative sounding review I did enjoy replaying the game for the most part, but I also feel that there are too many issues with this game that I ignored when I was younger simply because I had poor taste. Overall I guess I would only recommend this game to people looking for a nostalgia fix or a surprisingly deep pet game that lasts for hours with an okay Sonic game added on. Otherwise, go play Sonic Colours or Sonic Generations, as those are the better 3D Sonic games.","June 24, 2014","false","28.7"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

Yes, really! This was my favorite Sonic title from the franchise, but that was after I took off my nostalgic glasses. Replaying this game again was such a terrible experience that I just had to stop. The Knuckles/Rogue levels are simply the worst things to be included in a Sonic game, but it's no Big the Cat fishing segment from Sonic Adventure; however, it comes pretty damn close! Hunting for chaos emeralds wouldn't be as bad if the attrocious rap music for Knuckles' levels weren't included, but you can't get away from that. Rogue's levels weren't as bad, but let's just say one time is enough. The Tails/Eggman segments weren't bad, but it's boring... Personally I think it was a step backwards from the original Sonic Adventure game where you had Tails race against someone. I understand they just wanted to bring back the Omega stages from Sonic Adventure, but it wasn't my thing; in fact, I think that the original did the score attack thing better. Now, the Sonic/Shadow stages... That's probably the only redeeming factor towards Sonic Adventure 2. It's the only thing going for this game! Going around at the speed of sound is definitely why I play Sonic games, why go slow when you can go fast? Might I add that this game is also buggy at times that really interfere with the core gameplay?\n\nPersonal Experience:\nNow, I know what you're thinking, this guy is just bad at the game, so he's giving this game a bad review. You're probably not far from the truth, but you're also talking to a guy who loved this game as a kid to the point of getting 'the secret stage'. I'd say I'm the type of gamer to complete a game if I really enjoyed it; which I did at one point, but I'm no good at speed running this game; which I'd assume classifies whether I'm bad at the game or not. I've owned this game on every single system it's been on, and that's saying something about how much I enjoyed the game. You're probably thinking, 'we get it!' Recently when I played Sonic Adventure 2 my thoughts were filled with excitement and nostalgia, but after getting to the Knuckles stage I just realized this is actually sh*t! I wasn't sure if it was due to the PC port being absoultely terrible, so I decided to play the GameCube version and then the Playstation 3 version. They're all bad... I had the Dreamcast version ages ago, but I can't remember if that played any different, but I'd assume it was better due to Sonic Adventure DX being bad in comparison to the original. The point of actually disliking Sonic Adventure 2 was during Boss Attack when I had to fight as Shadow on the 2nd last boss, and the hit detection was horrible... I remembered rage quitting, and just ending it right then and there. Reflecting on everything now, Sonic Adventure 2 may have been the start of Sonic titles going downhill. Oddly enough, Sonic '06 is where I saw Sonic shine to be better once again. My favorite Sonic title eventually became Sonic Generations, and that's exactly what I wanted to see in a Sonic title; speed and nothing but playing as Sonic!\n\n~ twitch.tv/samsterboy ~","May 5, 2014","false","4.9"," 12 of 29 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","12","29","0","0"

Its not worth the 10 bucks.The action stages are good, but nowher near as well designed or control as well as the Sonic stages from the original Sonic adventure. The treasure hunting levels are god awful. Not only are they hugely spacious, they give you "hints" that you would only understand upon a 2nd or 3rd playthrough. Lets not forget that your emerarald detector only detects the emerald it wants you to find. Even if you're right next to the emerald, it won't activate if thats not the emerald it wants you to find. You have to find all 3 to finish the level. You can see my problem here. The shooting levels are just filler. They're not difficult or well designed, they just exist to pad out the game. The soundtrack is great. Its a Sonic game, after all. The story is convoluted and contrived and tries so hard to be edgy. It'll leave you with a headache trying to understand all the plotholes and inconsistencies.","June 29, 2014","false","15.1"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeltrain/recommended/213610/","eeltrain","Knife-Armed Robot Hedgehog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eeltrain/","144 products in account","My history with the Sonic series goes back over a decade. I've stuck with it and tried to keep an open mind through each of the games released from the mid-2000s to mid-2010s whose reception has, for the most part, been unspectacular. Even if Sega's ideas for the colorful creatures haven't always worked - and I will still contend that many games released during this time have - I very much respect them for branching out and flicking an angular, latex-gloved bird at the industry trend of using statistics to decide what kinds of games to create. So it's really a formality, after all, for me to review possibly the last Sonic game that's consistently respected. And boy, have I ever had a lot of fun with the game, so here it goes:\n\nSonic Adventure 2 has some serious problems.\n\nThe game's sunny, San Francisco-esque first level, City Escape, is unique but completely fitting. I've played through it dozens of times trying for the elusive A-rank and completing subsequent missions, and dozens more just for the sheer fun of it. The majority of later levels, though, are much less impressive.\n\nTails' and Eggman's offerings - the style is identical - are intelligence-insulting, slow, repetitive shoot-'em-up excursions that encourage the player to tap the shoot button for several minutes on end as fast as possible while executing platforming stunts with oddly realistic physics amidst, more often than not, vast expanses of abyss. To be fair, later levels do contact the player's brain for directions once in a while, as shooting certain hatches or covers can expose the level to the universe outside and thus suck the player in. I'm pretty sure that's not how gravity works, but forgivable. What's less forgivable is just how annoying this mechanic is; after being trained to shoot until I can physically shoot no more, I don't much appreciate being slapped in the face by a quick death.\n\nKnuckles' and Rouge's levels I rather enjoy - the ones on Earth, anyway. Those feature much more interesting and varied scenery and more concise, inspired level design. No, it's not speedy, but I don't really miss that. Aside from some abysmal physics in parts of the level Mad Space, Emerald-hunting levels generally play very fluidly and without issue. They're also quite relaxing and force the player to get more intimate with Sonic levels than they may be used to.\n\nSonic's and Shadow's will likely feel the most familiar to players of not only the Genesis Sonics, but of other 3D titles as well; Sega decided this was the formula that worked the best. For the most part, they're right; the levels are exhilarating, expecting speed and precision as only levels in the Sonic series do. My enthusiasm, unlike Omochao's to help the player, however, is finite: the hedgehog levels occasionally display awkward physics and glitches, and the precision necessary to avoid cheap deaths can get ridiculous. Play or watch a Let's Play of one of the rail levels (particularly Sky Rail) or get acquainted with the homing attack - there's a narrow window of time and distance from a target when you have to press the jump button to neither plummet to your death nor get hit and fall backwards to your death - and you'll see what I mean. Hedgehog gameplay is fun overall, but it's imperfect.\n\nIt's high time now for me to talk about what I find by far the worst aspect of the game: the cutscnes. Sweet mother of Wisps, are they ever bad. I get that Sonic Adventure 2 is a Japanese game, but there's "non-native but kawaii and starting every other sentence with 'But,'" and then there's "voice actors literally interrupting each other and tire-hopping through their already stilted dialogue as they pitifully try to map it to the natural rhythm of the English language." In one scene, I kid you not, Knuckles interrupts himself. More mildly, but still effecting of distraction, Eggman's voice is way too quiet, and Tails sounds like an actual, gross, human 8-year-old boy instead of the parallel-universe fox we've grown to love.\n\nIt's a shame that the cutscenes of later games (e.g. Shadow's existential mopings, Charmy's inexplicable top-secret discs, Sonic's gooey romance that I'm pretty sure is illegal in 15 zones and Westopolis, with further legislation being drafted in Station Square) are the infamous ones, when they actually represented serious and respectable efforts to advance their games' stories. The FMV sequences in Sonic Adventure 2 don't only flop on a technical level; they don't even seem to take themselves seriously. As a result, I can't take the plot of the game seriously - well, any more than I otherwise would considering it's about talking animals, gigantic emeralds, and a truck the width of a street and both sidewalks. Honestly, it's completely fitting that the captions are all in Comic Sans. How would I summarize SA2's cutscenes? They stink, like echidnas do!\n\nLike Sonic jumping from some height and being blasted far higher than before by a spring, however, I do have to give one aspect of the game the extreme, saccharine praise it deserves: the music. Each of the six characters has their own style, and every single time it fits both their personality and their gameplay style. Sonic corresponds to pop-punk, Tails jangly alt-rock, Knuckles rap, Shadow industrial rock, Eggman vaguely funky alt-metal, and Rouge smooth jazz. With a minor exception of Knuckles, I never get bored of it within each level, and even with him only because they can take so long. (Not a bad thing! Not a bad thing!) Even the game's intro theme changes time signatures a few times to ring in the characters, as if a conceptual overture to the radically divergent styles. I'm not sure much of anything could have been done to improve the game's tunes, and you know what, I don't even care that they almost drown out the voices during certain cutscenes.\n\nIt does sadden me to say that I can't recommend the game, despite all the fun times I've had with it. (Stop staring forlornly at me, you blasted thumbs-up! It's not your fault, but Sonic Adventure 2's had its chance!) It just doesn't claim the accessibility or polish that I would need to, in reasonable intellectual honesty, suggest to a friend who isn't experienced with the Sonic series' odd physics and gameplay style. Even I don't enjoy the Tails/Eggman levels much. So, while there is a lot I appreciate and would entreat the adventurous (no pun intended) consumer to try, I have to give it a "no" for the general public.\n\nAlso, what's up with King Boom Boo?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Inspector-Callahan/recommended/213610/","Inspector-Callahan","Scott Shelby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Inspector-Callahan/","496 products in account","Sonic Adventure Dos is a game about a green hedgehog who is living life outside of the societal norms. He is wanted by the police from the start of the game, goes on to assault multiple officers of the law, and never has to pay for his crimes against society. All the while, the evil Dr. Eggman is trying to bring justice and order to the world, but when a larger force brings Sonic and his criminals to justice, Eggman sides with Sonic's criminal behavior in order to try to save the world. Thus proving the incompetence of everyone involved, since they couldn't kill a stupid hedgehog who is a menace to society.\n\nThis game features many things that previous Sonic games didn't have. First off, we have the music. Unlike previous Sonic games, the music in this game is made by Skrillix, who is known for being hip with the kids with his rockin dubstep. But instead of dropping the bass, he picked one up and wrote the theme to City Escape, entitled City Escape 1. It's grating on the ears and reminds us all that suicide is a definite answer.\n\nNext are the 3D controls, remember when Sonic controlled well in a 3D environment? No? That's because that never happened. Sonic Adventure proved that Sonic was a terrible franchise, and Sonic Adventure 2 reinforced that idea. The controls for this game reqiure you to hang upside down with one hand taped to the controller, and the other taped to your ♥♥♥♥. In order to maximize results, you should occassionally dip your head into a bucket of water, since it will remind you of the terrible choices you made leading up to you playing this game.\n\nFinally we have the story. I'm sure everyone plays Sonic for it's rich story environment. But this story involves things that children should not dabble in, assault on officers of the law, prostitution to get emeralds, and stealing. If I didn't know better, I would say that this game was designed to be for young black children to get a head start in their lives. Not to mention, all the levels with Knuckles have some urban black kid music playing.\n\nI give this game a 3/10 for promoting gang violence and treating blacks like people.","May 11, 2014","false","9.5"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","1"

Loose controls, muddy textures, and an awkward camera help create a mostly uncomfortable experience when compared to more modern 3D platformers. The voice acting is terrible, but at times falls into "So bad it's good" territory. Perhaps worst of all are the boring and tedious Knuckles/Rouge levels which could be considered crimes on par with human trafficking.\n\nWhereas Jet Set Radio and NiGHTS Into Dreams are two classic Sega titles that have received the HD treatment and still hold up quite nicely in terms of both their visuals and their gameplay, Sonic Adventure 2 wasn't nearly as fortunate.

Even if you can look beyond the flaws of the game itself (as many have), or beat the game enough that you can just do the Sonic and Shadow stages, you have to be ready for this interpretation of the game to frequently disconnect due to its requirement of always on DRM that frequently malfunctioned on my machine (ironically making it easier to play a pirated copy of this game than a legitimate one).\n\nThis is a very disappointing sequel to the fantastic Sonic Adventure, which unless you're the most die-hard of Sonic fans, I suggest you avoid at all costs (especially the PC version).","November 25, 2013","false","31.7"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

Hell, it's my personal favorite. It has two story modes, the Good side and the Dark side. The good side features the characters Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The Dark side features Doctor Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik, and two new characters that made their debut in this game, Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the Bat. Both sides offer speed stages, which feature the two hedgehogs, treasure hunting stages, featuring Knuckles and Rouge, and mech suit shoot-em-up stages, featuring Tails and Dr. Eggman. This game did so many things right, I can hardly point out any flaws. Some of the gameplay mechanics get repetitive, the power-ups can seem like too much of a hassle, and getting the highest rank on every mission requires weeks, if not months of dedication. All in all, I definitely reccommend this game to any fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, or just SEGA in general.","October 4, 2013","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are all extremely linear and feel mostly the same (set aside a few level gimmicks like a truck).  These were the most fun this game offers though.  The Mech shooting is trying to cappitalize off the Gamma's playstyle in Sonic Adventure 1 and it is not nearly as fun now.  Imagine the Sonic levels, only slower, god awful controls, and has guns.  (So basically it's Shadow the Hedgehog)  The treasure hunting stages are the worst.  There is this "radar" that doesn't show you were the treasure is half the time because it wants you to find them in a set order...  really?  The controls were actually decent during these, only this game does not work very well on a keyboard.\nThe graphics are ok enough considering how old the game is at this point, but the sound, oh god the sound!\nThere are some nice music tracks but it lacks variety, 95% of the music in this game is metal, with the only exception being the occasional smooth-jazz or cheesy raps.  During cutscenes the mnusic drowns out the characters so I can barely hear them, which isn't to bad because I'm not missing much here.  The plot is chock full of loopholes, missed oppritunities, unexplained crap, and is generally an uninteresting mess.  Sonic and Robotniks voice actors aren't terrible, but everyone else does an either mediocre job, or one that makes me want to shave off my ears *cough Tails cough*\nOh yeah, I almost forgot about the chao garden, I applaud the devolpers for how deep of a mode this is, and I see the appeal, but it wasn't for me.\nThis game has aged horribly, even people who played it growing up will notice how lack-lester of a game it really is.","February 8, 2015","false","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Place the digestives in a plastic bag and crush to fine crumbs using a rolling pin; you can also do this in a food processor. Tip them into the pan with the melted butter, stir to coat, then transfer to a 20cm springform cake tin (9cm deep). Using the back of a spoon, press them into the base, making sure you seal the edges. Place in the fridge while you prepare the next stage.\n\nIf using leaf gelatine, place in a bowl, cover with cold water, soak for 5 mins, then drain. Pour 3 tbsp boiling water over the soaked gelatine and stir to dissolve. If using a sachet, see Know-how, below.\n\nPlace the crème fraîche in a small pan with the muscovado sugars and a pinch of sea salt, then gently heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture liquefies and the sugar has dissolved. Give the mixture a quick whisk to get rid of any lumps. It should be warm, roughly the same temperature as the gelatine solution. Stir the gelatine and vanilla extract into the crème fraîche mixture, transfer to a bowl and cool.\n\nPlace the ricotta in a food processor and whizz until smooth, then add the crème fraîche mixture and whizz again. Pour this on top of the cheesecake base. Cover with cling film and chill overnight.\nRun a knife around the sides of the tin, then undo the clip and remove it. Transfer to a plate or leave the cheesecake on the base for ease of serving. Pile the fudge flakes in the centre and dust with icing sugar.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iceika/recommended/213610/","Iceika","Iceika Zepher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iceika/","31 products in account","I'm going to start this review by saying this is my favorite game of all time, so I may be a bit bias.\n\nSection 1:  Story\nThe story of SA2 is just a tad deeper the most sonic games, like SA1's story was.  Sonic has been mistaken for a black and red counter part called Shadow, who was released by Dr. Ivo Robotnik (Eggman), in hopes of taking over the world.  Shadow hopes to uncover his past and fufill his promise of destroying the world to Maria, as the last thing he remembers is her death.  Shadow tells Eggman that if he delivers the 7 Chaos Emeralds to the Space Colony Ark, Shadow will grant him any wish.  Eggman wants to use this to wish for world domination.  Sonic, with the help of his sidekick Tails, are there to stop Eggmans plans.  The first emerald Eggman tries to locate turns out to be the Master Emerald, which can give power to the other 7 Emeralds.  Eggman tries to take it with him, but Knuckles breaks the Master Emerald before Eggman gets away.  Now Knuckles is trying to peice together the Master Emerald while Rouge the Bat tries to steal the shards for her own greed.\nI only have one problem with the story.  Knuckles and Rouge seem thrown in at the last second because SEGA felt they had to have Knuckles in, and Rouge because Knuckles needed a rival.  I'm ok with SEGA putting them in, but make them at least a LITTLE BIT relative to the story.  Rouge just ends up hanging out with Shadow and Eggman, and Knuckles only meets up with Sonic and Tails one time, then doesn't show up again untill the final mission!  They don't do ANYTHING to the story that couldn't have been done if they were both just dropped entirely.\n\nSection 2: Atmosphere\nMost of the hero stages (Knuckles, Tails, and Sonic) are preety upbeat until the near-end of the game, when they get serious for reasons that will be explained if you play the game.  The Dark stages (Shadow, Eggman, and Rouge) however, are vastly different.  Shadow's stages have the feel of knowing you are superior to everyone else, and you solve problems yourself because everyone else can't perform as well.  The Eggman stages feel as if you are evil and proud, and if anyone doesn't like it they can talk to your lasergun.  The Rouge stages have a mix of undercover, super spy and that you got this, and it's no big deal.  The art style feels a bit like the old sonic games, but mostly like a new fresh game like most other sonic games feel.  The music is the beautiful harmony that SEGA brings with nearly every sonic game, blending with the levels in a wonderful way.  I have a gripe about the amosphere too, as good as it may be.  When SEGA was making the US version of this game, they never bothered to fix the ever prominent cutscene issues.  Characters commonly cut each other off, talk simultaniously, and to top it all off, the voice sync sucks.  The problems are STILL in this version, even though they had PLENTY of opportunities to fix this.\n\nSection 3: Gameplay\nEver played a 3D sonic game?  Well that's Sonic and Shadow's stages in a nutshell.  Fast-paced platforming action with enough tricks up it's sleeve to keep you playing.  Tails and Eggman's stages take a different approach, doing a third person shooter-like approach in mech suits.  It's O.K., but not quite as good as the Sonic and Shadow stages.  Finally we have the ever-hated Knuckles and Rouge stages.  They could have been very fun, but a few small things kept it from being perfect.  The way it works is that 3 items are scattered along the level, and you have to find them.  To aid you is your radar, which tells you if you are close to the object, and Floating TVs that give you hints.  The first problem with this mode is the camera.  In enclosed spaces, you always have to fight to see where you want to.  The second problem is the radar.  The radar only picks up the item it wants you to find.  This means that if you are near one of the items you need, but it isn't the one the radar wants you to find, you could be right next to it and never know.  The third problem is the combat.  Combat in the treasure hunting stages can be clunky and it can be very easy to miss.  Thankfully there isn't a lot of combat in these stages.  There is also a place you can unlock and go to called the Chao Island.  There you can raise Chao with fruit you find on the island, Chao Drives, and animals.  Chao Drives and animals can be found in the stages.  You can also go to a small Chao area to buy things with your rings, such as Chao Eggs, Fruit, and other things.  You can also send you Chao to school, where they will learn certian skills, name your chao, and check your chaos stats in the same area.  There is also a seperate area where you can race a gainst other chao, or if you have the Battle DLC, play karate against other chao.  Speaking of Battle, the other things you get from it are a versus mode, and a kart racing game.  The Kart racer is a bit boring, because there are no power ups besides a boost.  The other battle modes are just the story levels exept your racing in the speed stages, dueling in the mech stages, and trying to find the certian items first in the treasure hunting stages.  The chao mode can be hit or miss with players, but I adore it.  The VS mode can a great way to battle your friends, and there is always a good character for beginners.\n\nAll and all, this is a great game for beginners to the sonic franchise, a solid game for experianced players, and with the Battle DLC, a good place to battle it out with friends.  The game has a few flaws, but there's plenty to keep you playing.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10","June 20, 2014","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is emotional and gets you on the edge.  The gameplay only adds to the story.  Amazing gameplay and the controls are easily the most smoothest I have ever used.  There is plenty of content to do even though this game changed from a more open world the first one was to a stage by stage story with cutscenes.
