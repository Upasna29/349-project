Here your character always running forward so you have to jump or hit enemies in time, otherwise miss chocolates or die, simple as that but still fun to play :)\n\n+Lovely drawings style, all the levels are colorful and looks nice\n+Nice OST\n+Each level has several objectives you have to complete to get badges to unlock more levels, like speedrun or find all secrets.\n+Upon completing levels you recieve chocolates collected on levels which you can spend to buy bonuses at the start of the next levels OR you can spend them to permanently improve those bonuses so they help better :)\n+Game itself is not very hard and nice for casual derping OR for kids :)\n++Ingame achievements attached to steam achievements\n++Steam cards\n-Has some minor issues like - when you jump+sword into the obstacle, sometimes you can pierce it and get stuck, the only thing that helps is level restart ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Game itself is not very hard to restart the level, but it could be frustrating if you do such a thing at the end of the level specially if you bought bonuses that try. Another bug i faced - invisible cursor in random times.\n-Lack of settings - i.e. no control remap, no resolution settings, no window size settings and the only option for sound is ON and OFF :) Slider for music and effects would be nice.","May 5","true","9.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The game itself is aimed at the hardened platformer rather than the casual gamer. Being of the latter I was expecting to replace another window in my house but my controller stayed firmly in my hand in what was an unexpected enjoyable playthrough!\n\nYou play Marcus in a side scrolling jumping platformer collecting Chokobongos while dishing out attack moves against foes that stand in your way. The developer purposely doesn’t give too much away as to how you get through a level as I found at my own peril. For example, to reach a certain platform out of jump range I had to use jump and attack! The game itself has enough replay value that it is easily worth the £3.99 as being able to collect enough badges to explore the 4 worlds through 20 levels will mean you will be exploring the same level just to find those hidden secrets not to mention help in the form of bonuses to unlock the Expert Mode challenge and the next world. The game has a nicely animated cartoon style to it and the music although a little repetitive suits the genre style.\n\nThere were some minor issues that did let it down. Through a level you can get the chance to turn into a frog or cloud that then changes the gameplay into a flappy bird clone. I found this to be the biggest drawback purely as you have no direct control over his movement other than bashing a button which made these particular stages frustrating especially when you are trying to collect everything! There were a few glitches where I had got stuck on an object and had no choice but to restart, but issues aside you are getting your money’s worth with this title! As I am sure the Developer will update and fix any anomalies.\n\nFor hardened gamers who like their platform games and completing levels will be in their element but if you are a casual gamer like me, you will find Marcus Level more enjoyable in shorter playing times! I have a video of the first two levels just so you can get an idea of style and gameplay!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p8h-C1UF8E","January 26","true","1.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/417480/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Have you ever really wanted an indie game to be good but it just couldn’t quite live up to your hopes? 3DDUO’s Marcus Level will forever be one of those games for me. I was drawn in by the concept and the idea behind the game. Even though it’s far from unique it’s the type of concept and game that generally sucks me into playing it through to completion – if not achievement wise then certainly to the point where I’ve experienced all of the content on offer. Sadly, I found too many frustrations to be able to make that claim here.\n\nThe list of frustration needs to begin with the controls particularly between levels. The mouse cursor comes and goes seemingly as it pleases and it is an absolute nightmare to use the controller during the pre-level sequence where you can choose which power ups you want to utilize during the level. I never knew what I was purchasing, if anything, and often times when I wanted to buy something with the controller the game would instead just skip into the game itself. These menu issues were easily the biggest frustration that I had with the game. I realize that you play a game to play the actual game but in these types of action platformers you’re dealing with the menus every minute or so. (Edit: on a later playthrough I found that this happened when you pressed a controller button during the menu sequence but if you left the controller alone that this issue didn’t happen as often but it is still highly frustrating that it should happen at all. It’s far too easy to press a controller button when you’re not supposed to and the only fix from this point on is to either reload the game or you’re left to play and hope).\n\nSecondly, and perhaps a bigger one for the game itself, is the game’s putrid hit detection. It just does not work as it should. A game such as this relies on its consistency. When you lose that consistency you lose the quality of your product. You can jump on the head of monsters and be successful yet at other runs you’ll jump on that very same monster’s head and it wont register as a successful hit. This is bad because how you deal with enemies becomes increasingly important the further into the game that you play.\n\nAlthough the developer has taken away as much as they possibly can that would signify that the game is a mobile port you can clearly tell that Marcus Level is a port. I think that’s where a large part of the problem with the menu systems can be traced. They’re clearly there and big enough to be pressed with a finger rather than a mouse or controller. The sad thing is had I been reviewing the mobile version of the game then there is a strong likelihood that I wouldn’t be criticizing the game nearly as much as I am here. It really does play like it would be a strong mobile game (I’ve never played the mobile version). I don’t know how heavily microtransactions come into play on the mobile version but if it’s similar to the PC version then it would be a fantastic system and a perfect ‘on the go’ game.\n\nIt’s never, or at least, rarely all bad. That is the case here. I actually do quite enjoy the overall presentation of the game especially from a graphical and sound perspective.  It is charming and cute. It’s pretty to look at without being state of the art. 3DDDUO have taken full advantage of the Steam platform incorporating both achievements and trading cards. I appreciate that. There are 135 achievements and some of them are relatively easy to get on a first playthrough. When the game is not making you frustrated it is actually enjoyable. Perhaps this fine line between frustration and enjoyment makes this a game that should be revisited upon further updates if the game is supported post-release.\n\nUnfortunately at this time, Steamified cannot recommend Marcus Level to anyone except hardcore platformer fans who are looking to play a recently released title or to achievement hunters who are suckered in by the whopping 135 achievements on offer here. We hope that the devs at 3DDUO support Marcus Level and continue to make games and to build upon the potential that is present in this game.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 31","false","8.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Boring stages, boring achievments, boring music, boring everything. The hit detection is really messed up..I can jump on an enemies head sometimes and be successful while other times I die. I've encountered so many glitches too I can't even count them. If you jump in an area that wasn't meant to be jumped in, then you get stuck and have to restart. I've gotten stuck in the goal as well because you move faster when you sword jump. I did a sword jump right before the goal a couple of times and got stuck in the wall. It's pretty much a mess. It feels more like a flash game or a game meant for phones. Kids may find this fun, but If you're an adult and enjoy platformers, stay away at all costs.","January 24","false","9.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"
