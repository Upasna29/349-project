If being the best driver means driving on an ice skating rink, the cars are all so floaty the slightest movement causes the cars to careen off screen or into walls.  From the start of the game it shows there is zero AI at all in the other computer drivers.  Facing a straight road you have to hit speed jumps to go faster.  Right away all the other cars speed away at the speed of light making it impossible to win.  The AI opponents it seems are set to challenge the racer as if they have all upgrades already which is impossible on the first track.  The game has a bunch of tracks but who cares if their impossible to unlock since you need 1st place in the first 3 stages to unlock the next set.  Basically for the price you get 3 races thats it.\n\nThese should be the little cars they sell in stores, instead of feeling like their little they just feel like regular cars with really bad controls.  There is no super small driving fun in a world where everything is bigger.  There isnt much selection of cars seems for each team there is 2 cars, there seems to be unlockable cars but it doesnt say how to unlock them and who cares since this sucks.  The announcer is the most robotic generic voice in history, its not fun it feels like someone is using a text to speech device to teach the player how to drive, that isnt fun!!! Games should be FUN!!!!\n\nGet Super Toy Cars for super fun small racing:  http://store.steampowered.com/app/116100/\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00","September 21, 2014","false","0.6"," 48 of 64 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","48","64","6","1"

If I hadn't bought this from Greenman on uber-clearance, I'd be crying an entirely different sort of tears right now. I laughed so hard, I developed abs.\n\nOne complaint, though; I wish there was a way to tweak the controls to be slightly more absurdly sensitive.  I feel like I'm not flying off the track enough.","June 16, 2014","false","1.0"," 52 of 74 people (70%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","70","52","74","35","1"

Everything you'd never think of when you think of Hot Wheels.

Then they had the most awesome stunt game opportunity and decided to do it without any stunts.
