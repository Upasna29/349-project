I have played this game, way more than I care to admit. It is genuinely fantastic.\n\nLet's just get the hyperbole out of the way up front. Rise of Flight is, in my mind, easily one of the best flight sims ever made. It's a shame this business model switch has opened the floodgates to reviewers who haven't given the game much of a shot. This is a flight sim, and an in-depth one at that. You need to try it for more than an hour or two to even finish a mission. I'm frankly astonished that so many people have clicked that they found some of these reviews helpful.\n\nThis is a game that serves a small audience. It would not exist if not for this business model. A business model, that if you really look at it, is not a bad deal for gamers. Sure, the base free game is basically a demo. Why is that bad? You didn't pay anything for it. Realistic flight simulators are not main stream gaming by any strech of the imagination, and if people want them to exist, they need to understand that they're going to have pay for content. Purchasing each plane pack gets you the use of included planes everywhere. Further, you can absolutely dive into the game with just the one included plane, and even purchasing just a single plane pack gives you a massive amount to do.\n\nNo game has captured the sensation of flight like Rise of Flight. The game really does give the impression you're in a hot-rod car with cloth wings and a gun mounted to the front that is somehow flying. Having your wing partly seared off in a battle is terrifying, and clawing your way back from No Man's Land to land while spewing smoke and being chased by enemies is an experience few other games have matched for me. I've bombed bridges, photographed troop movements, and won dogfights by crippling my opponent piece by wooden piece. I'd strongly recommend anyone thinking about purchasing content for this game look up professional reviews, most of which are very positive.\n\nThis game isn't a traditional free-to-play game, that much I conceed. It is not an iOS game, or a play-to-win game, or an arcade flight game, or whatever else people think they're getting. It is an amazing simulator that demands your full attention.\n\nDo you want to know what WWI flight combat really felt like? For that, nothing out there comes even remotely close to Rise of Flight.","June 16, 2015","true","75.8"," 208 of 234 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","208","234","4","3"

Instead of being able to dogfight where you can afford to be almost entirely focused on the enemy plane/s a la IL-2, you will need to split your attention 50/50 between the enemy aircraft and your own aircraft. This is because simply put, the aircraft found in WWI were in fact nicknamed "kites" for a reason! Your plane is incredibly fragile and is prone to having its wings snap off or its engine conk out (typically in the form of the oil in the engine suddenly and unexpectedly pouring out onto your face) seemingly on a whim. If you're familiar with the cold sweat-inducing feeling of nursing your crippled Heinkel back to the airfield in IL-2, this is the feeling you will generally have while flying a plane in RoF normally. (Hell, take-off can very easily become quite fatal!)\n\nIn summary, Rise of Flight is more-or-less IL-2 Sturmovik cranked up to "hardcore mode", and it's brilliant! (Also, although the extra content packs seem quite pricey, they are actually packed with quite a lot of content; so I'd say get acquainted with the base game or demo on the RoF site, then get one or two of the packs that you like the look of during a sale)\n\n\n\n* If you haven't, get IL-2 Sturmovik 1946, not Cliffs of Dover.","December 16, 2013","true","94.7"," 109 of 127 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","109","127","0","0"

Since this is a simulation, it has the things you expect, good graphics, good fidelity (I've never flown an actual WW1 fighter, but things seem right to me FWIW), and enjoyable.\n\nI say enjoyable for me, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. It aims for the same realism as DCS, and coming from some time in DCS I think it compares favorably. Because of the setting, I didn't have to spend 10 hours programming a joystick and wading through tutorials and was able to jump in and fly relatively quickly. Less complexity to the Aircraft makes it more fun for me.\n\nSpeaking of fun, I can't overstate the immersion factor having a campaign mode brings to this game. Its supposed to be in Beta, but to me its already pretty complete. I do look forward to more improvements in this regard, but having a campaign mode makes the whole thing worthwhile. I miss the days of the old MP Sims where a career mode was just so much fun and the campaign mode in this game puts all those hours spent in-game in context. Still not what it could be but shows a lot of promise and head and shoulders above anything else out there for a sim game.","November 28, 2013","true","53.8"," 89 of 105 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","89","105","0","0"

I'll format my review as a list of replies to the most common strawman arguments I get.\n\nFirst, if you own this game from several years ago, or play the "FTP" version directly from ROF's site, then get the ♥♥♥♥ out, you don't know what you're talking about here. As near as I can tell, the Steam version of this game is drastically different (as in, far worse) than the other versions.\n\nSecond, if you're the sort to accuse people of not knowing anything about flight because they mention War Thunder, then ALSO get the ♥♥♥♥ out. I've flown Cessnas in real life, I've been playing flight simulators since I was a little kid (13-15 years), and have played a myriad of flight sims including X-Plane 9 and 10 (used by the FAA to train pilots), Flight Sim X, Orbiter, Flight Gear, Lock On, IL-2, and the entire CFS series. So go ♥♥♥♥ yourself if you're here just to call me a "war thunder kiddy" for having the gall to mention it in my review.\n\nThe good parts about this game is that it has a great flight model, an even better damage model, and alright graphics considering its age... That's where the good parts end. The UI and mission parameters are obnoxious.\n\nThe biggest negative (which in my opinion, outweigh the positives) is this game's business model (among a few other minor things I won't have enough room to go into).\n\nThe short of it is: THIS IS NOT A FREE TO PLAY GAME. FTP in recent years has come to mean a specific kind of business model, which most of you already know about. If you've never played a legit free to play game, then go try one out (like world of tanks or war thunder) BEFORE leaving a nasty hate comment about me supposedly expecting everything to be free.\n\n"Stop comparing this to War Thunder you peasant, it cannot match the awesome flight model of ROF"\n\nOne example of a LEGIT free to play flight game is War Thunder (Que hate mail). I'm not saying War Thunder is a great game. It's definitely not. They've been removing sim battles, and turning realistic battles into arcade with slightly better flight models, so I can't even make the "realism" argument in its defense anymore. ROF has War Thunder beat in realism. There, ya happy? Now quit telling me what I already know. I never said WT was better than ROF in flight model, just in business model.\n\nThe REASON I compare that game to this one is because War Thunder actually HAS a decent free to play business model. If you've come to ROF looking for a FTP flight game, trust me, it's SO not. I would recommend War Thunder if you're looking for a FTP flight game (espescially if you're not too serious about realism, and are just looking for something more casual).\n\nSo, ROF is NOT like War Thunder. I was dissappointed by this, because when I think of a free to play game, I think of a business model like War Thunder's. When I see that "Free To Play" tag, it's an expectation I have, one that is severely dissappointed when I waste 2 hours finding out what this game's business model is really like. This should be considered false advertising, since 90% of ROF can't actually be played for free... What else is this game NOT like?\n\n"It's like DCS"\n\nAs near as I can tell, this game is NOT like DCS... So stop saying that it is. I have yet to play DCS, though I plan on it at some point. DCS only has one DLC explicitly related to campaigns or missions. Everything else is just planes. As such, I suspect most of DCS' content comes with that initial free download, and the DLCs are OPTIONAL planes that people can buy to fly in that already existing free content. Although it's not the sort of setup I would've gone with, it's still not bad. It's infinitely better than what ROF has done. Evidence of this fact lies in the fact that this game has almost 50% negative reviews (and rising), while DCS has only about 20%. CLEARLY, something's different enough between the 2 to make people like DCS a helluva lot more, and I suspect it's the business model.\n\nAlright, so this game is NOT like War Thunder (despite its misleading "free to play" label) and it's NOT like DCS (quit saying it is). But what IS this game like. I've pointed out what it's not like for the benefit of the dip♥♥♥♥♥ who keep commenting about DCS and War Thunder.\n\nThis game is a 7-8 year old game that USED to be offered for 30-50 dollars for 100% of the game's content (Or at least, A LOT of the content). It was basically old school, before all this DLC nonsense really took over. I would GLADLY spend 50 dollars down payment on this game for all or most of its content. That's what this game's business model was DESIGNED for, and it's what the game devs should've ♥♥♥♥ing stuck to.\n\nInstead, they had a massive rush of ♥♥♥♥ to the brain, took that 50 dollars worth of pre-existing content OUT of the game, and are now selling it piecemeal for a total of 200-300 dollars. DCS was INTENDED to be DLC based from the start. This game's devs on the other hand tried to copy-cat that game with turning pre-existing content into DLC to make more money... And they SO went overboard trying to do so. They made EVERYTHING a DLC.\n\nAnd this ISN'T just the planes, like what DCS seems to do. Most of the campaign mission series' need to be bought as DLC. And I can't even play the supposedly "free" campaign series because each mission in those campaigns REQUIRES you to use a certain aircraft... Which means I need to go buy that aircraft before playing that mission. And you need to play missions in sequence as well, so I can't even skip to the missions that DO use the 2 or 3 free aircraft.\n\nAll the multiplayer servers seem to require plane purchases as well, though according to the devs, there's supposedly a server for just the FTP planes (though I certainly couldn't find it).\n\nAll that's left is some sort of dynamic campaign thing you can't play half of, and a few free maps. You can't play much more than the training missions. 90% of the content needs to be bought, and then you need to buy the planes for the content on top of that.\n\nThat's not "Free to Play". That's a DEMO. Put your game in that category instead, and maybe you wont get so many negative reviews from dissapointed gamers. You're LYING to gamers by labelling this as "Free to Play", because it just isnt.\n\n"You should review the game itself, not the business model or advertisement"\n\nNo, because the business model and false advertising is part OF the game. How can I recommend a game that's advertised poorly, and simply isn't worth the money?\n\n"This is a niche community, that's why it's expensive"\n\nFunny, the company that made this game seems to have made a decent enough profit off of offering 100% of this game's content for 30-50 dollars for the past 7 years. Seems the only thing that's changed is how willing a niche community is to blindly buy DLC without considering whether or not it's worth that much money as a whole. It so ISNT worth 200-300, and if this is the trend for flight sims now thanks to you guillible saps, then I want the ♥♥♥♥ out of this "niche community". You all need to stop listening to the blatant lie that this aging game is suddenly worth 300 dollars just because it's a flight sim\. This game was offered for just 1/6th that for most of its history.\n\n"You shouldn't expect everything for free you commie"\n\nI don't. I expect products to not use false advertising, and go for either a reasonable down payment price, or a decent F2P business model. This is me protesting a game I feel is unfairly priced, by not buying it. Either make the game use a legitimate free to play business model, or label this a DEMO and charge a reasonable down payment for the full game. Simple as that.\n\n"Whether or not price is worth it is completely subjective (That's just, like, your opinion, man)"\n\nSo are reviews.

I will wait for a better product with more reasonable price model.","November 29, 2014","false","0.7"," 111 of 171 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","111","171","4","0"

I'm willing to buy DLC of this quality at this price (in fact I've bought the lot).  When compared to £15 I just paid for the FSX Spitfire I think the Rise of Flight DLC represents good value; at full price, however, I'm not so sure.  All flight sims seem to have adopted the DLC model, with DCS World typically charging 30 quid for theirs.  They should all be put against a wall and shot.\n\nThe DRM and registration is a pain, and I don't think it's made clear quite how to do this properly.  On first registering the game you're taken to the ROF website to create an account, and (if I remember correctly) you're given an activation key - but this activation key is for the demo version, and you also have to paste in your Steam purchase key as well or you do not get the Channel Battles Edition (I spent quite a while swearing and cursing about what thieves these guys were until I worked this bit out).  Likewise with the DLC, all you get from Steam is an activation key which must be entered before anything will work.\n\nThe graphics and detail are gorgeous on a half decent machine (mine's two years old, so state of the art isn't required), but to set things up you need to launch a separate settings.exe file hidden away in SteamApps\common\Rise of Flight 2.0\bin_game\release\.\n\nAs for the game itself, where it's good it's absolutely outstanding, and where it isn't so good it really is cr@p.  The learning curve is steep.  Those early planes were awful, and real pigs to control.  This is reflected in the flight models, and even getting the damned things off the ground is a challenge.  If you want to jump straight into dogfights without learning how to work these things you won't last long; you'll tear your wings off or spin into the ground or, maybe, get shot down.  If you're not willing to spend time learning this game then think carefully before buying it, you might be better buying something else.  On the other hand, if you do stick with it, the first time you successfully take off, complete a few circuits and land safely is a real buzz.  This sim creates a feeling of actually being in the air better than any other I've played.\n\nWhere it's not so good is the mission and career selection, which all seems very muddled.  And while the the aircraft modelling is excellent, the character modelling is the worst I've seen for years, with voice acting so atrocious I winced the first time I heard it.\n\nOverall then: if you think you'd enjoy a challenging flight sim, and if it's at the right price, you should buy it.  Otherwise go to the ROF website and download the demo before spending any money.\n\nNow I'm off to have another go at getting that damned bomber off the ground...","May 31, 2015","true","43.3"," 44 of 60 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","44","60","6","0"

You will need to learn WWI aerobatic combat maneuvers to have any chance of defeating them, but there are training vids on Youtube to teach you. You need a joystick and TrackIR setup would help alot. Use the Smoothing feature for your joystick axii or your ride will be very bumpy. Biplanes are actually a lot less finicky than they are in this game, but the flight model is okay. Just if you have ever flown in a 1920's biplane you will be wondering what's wrong with the plane.\n\nOnce you get beyond all that RoF is a great game. The graphics are ultra-realistic and the planes beautifully re-created. I bought my Steam version when it was on sale last Xmas and the deals were pretty good. Cheaper than updating my original release DVD version. Kind of pricey at full price.","November 15, 2014","true","14.4"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","37","49","0","0"

The game lacks some degree of immersion I would want at the price of 50$ and the DLC is shameless. I will say the game plays well but in terms of bang for your buck it falls far short of IL-2(10$ on steam) and the massive amount of free mods available.

Well, they seem to have listened, because it has changed.\n\nWhat it is:\nA decent WW1 combat simulation. It has Single Missions, Campaigns, Career Mode, and Multiplayer. The flight models are very good (my only beef here is a complete lack of torque and P-factor, but that may be my options), and you can switch between different gunner and pilot stations on your planes. This makes flying bombers really fun.\n\nThe whole thing seems to be based on the DCS/IL-2 engine. You get DCS graphics and effects, with IL-2 style menus and interface.\n\n\nWhat you get:\nThe free-to-play version now includes THREE planes, a campaign, and a career mode. Obviously, more can be purchased to increase your options as to what you can play and fly (more campaigns, planes), but the basic gameplay is all there. Extra planes and content aren't expensive if you wait till they go on sale.\n\n\nIf you like to fly and are looking for something different, give this a shot with some friends. Do some dogfights for free, then decide what kind of DLCs you all want. Bombers are fun to multi-crew, for starters. ;-)","August 28, 2015","true","15.4"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

Been flying sims since I was a kid.\nThere are a few accessories you should probably have to get the maximum enjoyment out of this title and they aren't cheap.\n\nA head tracking device is almost necessary to get the immersion out of this title. When coupled with headphones, you can hear the nuanced wind sounds as you turn your head in your cockpit, trying to keep a beat on your enemies or just looking around at the gorgeous scenary.\n\nA flight stick is highly recommended, of course. Just like trying to play an FPS title with a controller is alike to eating ice cream with a shovel, trying to play a functional flight sim with a keyboard does not allow you the full spectrum of movement that you should have.\n\nNow, you don't have to have these things, but they are very nice to have. The problem is that these things are expensive, as is this game. I wouldn't say it's "overpriced" because the level of detail makes it evident that there was a lot of work that went into this title. The DLC is also very expensive and it is somewhat harder to excuse this, but the DLC themselves are bundled into packages that at least make sense. For instance, if you buy the package containing bombers, you get mostly bombers.\n\nAll things considered, this is a hard game to recommend, unless you fall under the banner of a very niche audience. If you have doubts about this purchase, watch a few videos online and see if this would be for you. It's a beautiful experience, but to get the most enjoyment out of it you have to have a certain set up.","May 7, 2014","true","33.6"," 49 of 71 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","49","71","0","0"

The level of historical detail in Rise of Flight is extremely impressive, especially the vast variety of historical "skins" for the planes you fly, and how certain planes are available to certain squadrons at specific points during the war (in career mode).\n\nIt's tough going at first, and I managed to crash probably 20 times before I managed to get my first kill in a dogfight. Once you learn about the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the individual planes, it gets much easier.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpectreisGreat/recommended/244050/","SpectreisGreat","Spectre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpectreisGreat/","104 products in account","Rise of Flight is a World War 1 flight sim that is a game made for flight sim enthusiast's, thus the game tenders to a small audience and genre. The game upon start-up is a tad confusing for someone who has never really had a flight sim, but being a normal gamer I ventured into the unknown playing a quick match. After taking awhile to find the "Start Mission" button I was off.\n\nThe game is visually stunning, even for me with a relatively old gaming rig. The detail to the airplane is stunning and really helps capture the feel of playing in one of these vintage aircraft, from the seat to the gunsight everything seems authentic and comes alive as you fly around and if you have any interest in airplanes this game takes you right in.\n\nFor controls it really depends, the only thing I can say specifically is that you NEED a joystick. Its required to play unless you want to spend hours assigning controls to your mouse. Anyways, each plane has its own play style and handles differently. Some planes require more mastery of the controls to play than others. I found that for noobs the best planes to play are German, I found they were easier to control over the British and French planes.\n\nThe Game has a couple of different modes, obviously a multi-player mode but it also has a campaign, quick match and Career mode. In Multi-player I feel as though everyone should know how it works but if not: All servers have their own maps and rules with differing difficulties meaning only so much help is given to you via onscreen gauges and auto managed engine controls. Usually the objective is to kill the enemy. Pretty basic. The campaign is (from what I gathered) just a bunch of missions with varying objectives, from intercept enemy fighters to attacking their bases. Finally my favourite mode: Career mode. In Career mode you get to choose from either Belgian, French, British or German careers (When you pick a side you are just picking a squadron from that nationality). Once you've selected what side you want to play for, you can change the date (Between September 1916, to December 1918) to get the aircraft you want, because they are available only during the time they were available during the war. Once you've done that you pick your name, age and background (E.G: I was a fisherman from New Foundland). Finally you get to play the game, the Career mode is connected to a server so you get to see leaderboards for overall scores, and people in your squadrons score. I personally like the feature, adds a bit more of a goal and sort of drives you a bit. The game also gives you a newspaper every week and its actually pretty fun to see the progression of the war in-game and on the right it has the top 50 aces and its cool to see how some keep passing the other. In Career mode you start off as the low of the low, a grunt pilot who gets assigned missions and you do em, but you get a bit of an option. In my first Career mode I decided that doing the missions were not eventful enough so I broke away from my flight and went off on my own to hunt down some Germans, I found 3 and killed them. Returning to base and finishing the flight I got awarded a Victoria Cross and a Military Cross, it was kinda cool to be awarded medals. Makes the game have even more of a goal. After a month of playing I now have him pretty high on the leaderboards. Sadly, the career mode allows for restarting the mission so I doubt many people in the top 100 have played fairly.\n\nOne thing that is very angering is the selection of planes, there are around 8-10 base planes. I assume since the game isnt very popular, the dev's made it so that to get any more planes you have to pay for the packs. It wouldnt even be that bad if the packs didnt cost $25-$30. And you only get like 4 planes, a rip off but what can you do? I would personally like to be able to make my own combination of 4 planes and pay like $15. Seems more reasonable. The base planes are among the most popular like the "Sopwith Camel" and the "Albatros" so atleast you dont have to be at a disadvantage in multiplayer because they are good fighters, just sucks there is barely any variety.\n\nThe learning curve for this game is not that bad, obviously its there and pretty hard but compared to DCS or IL2 its alot better because the planes are relatively simple, and if you really cant stand all the realistic settings you can switch em off which makes it much easier for people who could care less about learning the game and just want to shoot other planes. It caters to hardcore flight sim players and people just interested in World War 1 aviation.\n\nA couple of personal notes that I want to discuss: Multiplayer with friends is absolutely a ton of fun, playing seriously or just messing around; Its a ton of fun. The game allows for players to be in the same plane so you and a couple friends can all be in a bomber just having the laughs of your life or actually trying to win it for the team, either way its awesome. Although, the game as a lone wolf is a bit depressing. Even when trying my hardest the enemy always seems to best me in turning or diving, and no one ever really trys to back you up. Obviously some games people coordinate the team but most times its just Call Of Duty World War 1 planes.\n\nMy final verdict is 8.5/10. The game looks amazing, has a pretty wide variety of missions and career mode is endless fun, Multiplayer can be hit or miss with some people and the lack of a variety with the planes kinda sucks. The core mechanics are solid and fluid and the game can be switched from super realistic to arcade style.","February 11, 2014","true","151.2"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","11"

I'm also a big gamer, and have played most of the flight  sims out there.\n\nThis game is good.  The graphics are exellent, the flight physics are a great blend between fun and simulation, and it hits all the right notes.  The ability to fine tune the flight physics in the game options, opting between linear and S-curved feedback controls from your joystick, for example, make this game a step above the others in terms of the serious pilot simulator.\n\nThat said, this game does have some miscues.  The menu options are somewhat vague and not very intuitive.  This is true throughout the game, and is a serious issue when you're trying to set up your camera hotkeys, for example.  It's more than just a little confusing.  The tutorial is kind of a joke, and is probably better skipped altogether.  The second tutorial, for example, turns you loose in the plane but doesn't explain how to start the engine...  and like everything in this game, there's a key combination to do that for you.... if you can find it.\n\nDon't get caught thinking that there's only 2 or 3 planes to play.  There are more, but again, there's no documentation about how to install the game properly, so you'll end up playing the Free to Download version that doesn't have all the maps or planes unlocked.  Simply write down your CD key after you install it, and add that to your online profile that you've created.  Next time you log in, it should unlocked most of the planes and maps in the game.\n\nThis game is hard...  and it didn't have to be.  With some proper documentation, hot keys, and a serious effort on the english tutorial, it would have been a great game.  It's still a lot of fun, if lacking a little in the atmosphere department, but overall a good sim.","June 16, 2015","true","7.0"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

You need to learn to fly with the bottom of your pants, with few instruments and navigate by sight.

How can this be? Based upon reading the reviews, a bunch of people installed the game now that it's free and proceeded to trash it with negative reviews, which I guess is understandable considering that this game appeals to a niche audience. If you're the type of person that enjoys a high-fidelity, historical flight sim that demands a joystick and patience, this game is for you. If you can appreciate that to play the game without any computer assistance you need to learn how to monitor your engine's fuel mixture, this game is for you. If the career mode, in which you follow your own pilot (replete with a nice narrative via his biography) throughout the war as you rack up victories and medals and eventually command your own squadron, this game is for you. If you're going to install this game because you see that it's free, there's a good chance it isn't for you. Please try it; that's why the devs made it free. In the free version you can access the game in full and decide whether or not its a right fit for you. If it isn't, just move on. But don't be like justmeman117, who after less than two hours gave it a negative review and ranted for at least that long about the game's marketing.\n\nOf course, that said, this game really does have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ marketing, and I regret sinking so much money into the steam version. Last year I spent probably $70 on the paid game and stupid dlc packs which left me with a mish mash of campaigns, planes, and dumb crap like streamers for my plane and coloured scarves for my pilot, when all the while the game could be downloaded free on riseofflight.com. To add insult to injury, you used to be able to buy all the game's content for $50 via their website, an option that's no longer available. If you're reading this, I suggest you refrain from playing or paying via steam for this game and go straight to the source.\n\nOf course, despite all that this game is still fantastic, and it scratches an itch and serves a niche like no other game. Flying above the French countryside is beautiful, looking down at no-man's land from the clouds is an impresive experience, and combat is  visceral, intense, and incredibly rewarding. Probably the most dramatic, nail-biting episode in any video game I've ever played was my epic duel with a French Ace in career mode, and my triumphal yell upon scoring my first kill was deafening. One of my all time favorites, and don't let the torrent of pouty reviewers dissuade you if you think this is your sort of game. Just try it; it's free!

It is not only one of my absolute favorite Flight Combat simulator games that I own. The aircraft are very detailed, and seem to accurately depict the flight models, giving you an immersive feeling of how they flew.  Some of the models are dead on from some of the blueprints and documents I had researched on my own time.\n\nI must admit, at first I was not sold on the idea of Bundles for planes and paying 15-30 USD per pack (or if you go and buy from the website, a couple of dollars an airplane).  After I tried it out, flew a few quick matches...I wanted to give it a go with the Early Years Pack, it was on sale for 7 USD from Steam.  What keeps this game and the community thriving, is that we as Simulator Enthusiasts/Collectors of Airplanes...want these planes, and those that want them, pay or invest into the airplane(s).\n\nThe Single Player Career mode is quite awesome, and can be a lot of fun, actually participating (or as close as we can get) in the dogfights over war torn Europe.  It has a pretty cool score keeping system, that shows all of the pilots across the world, and where you stand in comparison (and scored by difficulty).\n\nWhat about Multiplayer you ask???  The biggest plus for this game, is the on-line battles.  Huge maps, multiple object based maps, that can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours.  The biggest and best thing about the on-line is that the planes you had invested in, can most of the time be available to fly for your nation...while the free-to-try planes are descent, there is nothing like having a favorite plane to go out and fight (or BOMB) with.  As if that wasn't cool enough, the servers (even when you leave the server and come back the next day) keep track of your "Kill Streak or Bombing/Destroying of Ground Targets".  As long as you do not die or get captured over enemy lines, that streak continues just as if you were a real pilot...giving this game an added feel that other Combat Simulators have not quite had.\n\nI do apologize for the massive review, but I just say...it is for sure worth a go since it is "Free-To-Play" and if you are into great in your face Dogfights, then this game is a great option.  If you do end up buying the packs...feel free to join the on-line community (US Server Wargrounds) and get ready to have a blast.","September 7, 2015","true","374.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vetron/recommended/244050/","vetron","Vetron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vetron/","732 products in account","Having played this game since 2011 before it came to Steam, and before it was even free-to-play, I think it’s a great WW1 aviation simulator and really no other games come even remotely close to rendering this period of aviation in the way that Rise of Flight does.\n\nPerformance and PlayabilityWhen the game first released there was the typical optimization issues and ‘will my pc run it question’. But now through refinements and as hardware has moved on it does play really well and I encountered no issues personally as of writing this (Game runs fine for me on Windows 10).\n\nNOTE: You are required to create a straight forward in-game account to play this.\n\nAircraft SelectionThere is close to 40 aircraft included in the game consisting of fighters, recon, bombers and attack planes. Three of these can use without purchasing (Nieuport 17.C1 RUS, Albatros D.Va and SPAD 13.C1, which are all single seater biplane fighters). These can be modified with different weapons, additional cockpit gauges and paint schemes that all varies from plane to plane.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=678844811\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=678844246\nThe flight models are really well done, and makes for a really challenging experience on realistic simulation settings, and equally satisfying when you manage to shoot down an opposing aircraft, or even just survive a sortie. As learning curves go, these are some of the hardest planes to fly, but a really interesting period of aviation.\n\nNOTE: Don't forget to grab the official skin-pack located here[rof.s3.amazonaws.com] as it doesn't appear to be included in the base download.\n\nFree to play limitsThe game being currently 'Free-to-play', which means you can install the game and fly a few well-known aircraft without even having to purchase anything. There is around 35 additonal planes you can own with various purchases - but these are not required to enjoy the game unless you specifically wish to fly them. Planes you don't own will show up fine in Missions and you can play people online okay as-well.  Overall I don't consider current prices that expensive, when you compare to other Flight Simulators these are a lot cheaper and you could likely buy several aircraft for the less than you would of spent on a non free-to-play title. This does let you pay for the content you actually want, rather than paying full price for the base game, then having to buy addons on top.\n\nMultiplayerThe multiplayer used is not through Steam, however to simply join via in-game seemed quite straight forward and was quickly in the air flying missions, you can also host via in-game easy enough. A dedicated server on the other hand, while included is not that straight forward on how to even set it up and after long winded searches with mere snippets of information I was unable to test this.\n\nFree Flight (Quick Missions)In quick missions this is where you can setup quick engagements of a few types and specify a number of parameters easily for quick instant action gameplay for up to 30 aircraft. You are able to define the aircraft of 3 friendly and 3 enemy flights, including their formation (and number of aircraft in the formation), paint scheme, weapons and skill level. In some locations you can also choose to start on the ground and scramble start as enemy approach.\n\nThis mode is a good way to test the ability of your chosen aircraft, as you can choose to go against any aircraft you wish, including ones you haven’t purchased.\n\nMissions & CampaignsThere is a few scripted missions included that will work with 2 of the included free aircraft (SPAD 13.C1 and Albatros D.Va), as well as a training campaign. There is a mission editor external to the game.\n\nCareerThe career mode is a dynamic campaign but quite restricted without purchasing more aircraft. This is simply down to the fact most squadrons would change aircraft several time during the war and you would need all these planes for when they are each used.\n\nIf you have all the required aircraft for the squadron you wish to join (which could be French, German, Belgian or British), then career mode is a great game-mode that will offer countless hours of interest (and to be quite honest, is the main reason I play this so much).\n\nHINT: If you want to try Career mode with just the free to play aircraft, then select a time period of very early 1918, the French will be using the SPAD 13.C1 and Germans using the Albatros D.Va with select squadrons.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667569410\nConclusionSo if interesting in WW1 aviation, or are simply interested in aviation in general and want to take on a new challenge, then Rise of Flight is recommended. Given its free to play, there is not much to loose by trying it and there is quite a bit of content included to keep you busy.\n\nGood\nVast selection of detailed WW1 aircraft with modifications\nRealistic Flight models\nDynamic Campaign (Career)\nFree-to-play (Additional aircraft purchasable seperately)\n\nNot so good\nNon-steam multiplayer (easily playable, but without clear dedicated server setup procedure)","April 17","true","56.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

Look at the high quality modeling that goes into the plane models. As a modeler myself, and it would take me almost 1 weeks just for 1 plane model and each DLC gives you four of them. Look at Train simulator 2015, it has $4,000 worth of DLC's and DCS where they give you only 1 plane per DLC for the same price as ROF and they are not that good.\n\n\nSo...

Totally worth the effort. Joystick is a must and TrackIR or anything like it is recommended. My joystick could be better, but I'm still having fun with it. Sometimes I really feel the lack of a tracking system like TrackIR. Looking around with my joystick button is faster than using my mouse, but it's a bit annoying from time to time. Anyway, the immersive gameplay is brilliant!\n\nThe beautiful sound of your starting engine, controlling your mixture and/or radiator, orientating using only the map and your eyes, it's captivating. It makes you feel in control, feel connected to the charming technology of a past era. Shooting down an enemy is one thing, getting back to base in one piece (or at least being able to land) is another. I like the game very much, because more than in any other simulator you spend a lot of time keeping your plane in the air while orientating yourself. If you play it on full realism, that is.\n\nBuy it on sale, it's worth the 23 euros (at the moment). Decide which extra planes you want and buy the DLC that have them included. Every planes behaves differently, and once you fall in love (or already are in love) with a certain plane, you will crash and die a lot with it, while laughing your pants off.\n\nDon't be scared by the learning curve, I'm a mediocre player and I'm able to have fun with it. If you love WW1 planes, buy this game with the money you would have spent on food and just live on water and bread for a week. If you're tempted, don't resist.

The game has brilliant physics, the planes are well modeled and pretty cheap to buy for a flight sim, you can SHOOT OTHER PILOTS IN THE FACE WITH PISTOLS FROM YOUR OWN PLANE! There's also a great community of modders on their official forums, where you can download free Historically accurate & fictional skins for all the planes.\n\nIf you're planning on downloading it F2P style, I highly recommend you buy the 'Channel Battles' DLC, as the base F2P game is more of a platform for buying planes & DLC, whilst the 'Channel Battles' DLC adds a good selection of classic planes (Including my personal favourites, the SE.5a & Felixstowe F2a), a whole new region to fly in and a Career mode. Well worth the price.\n\nThe game also supports Keyboard + Mouse flight, which is actually quite good for newcomers/non Joystick owners.\n\nOverall I give it a 9/10.

You get a small number of planes to start with and then they sell several plane packs, some of them are like £20.00 for about 3 planes!! There is no option to unlock more planes through progress, only payment. You might want to consider Warthunder for free at least you can easly unlock pretty much all teir 1 and 2 planes without too much grinding and you have the option to spend money on stuff if you want.\nIf you must have WW1 planes and don't mind spending upwards of £30.00 to get started up with a few to try, then stick with Rise of Flight, it is a really unique flying experience although you will need a joystick to play the game. The dogfights can be a lot of fun especially in multiplayer and it is a joy to take off and fight then bring back a partially damaged flying boat. I hear that most players benefit from TrackIR or Freetrack so they can get better viewing angles like over the side of the cockpit. You can even hop into some of the bigger planes in a gunners position in multiplayer which is damn awesome, especially with yr buddies on comms.\nIf you are on the wall about buying the game then check out some Youtube videos, there are some pretty awesome battles too see.\nIf you have a good flight stick and TrackIR/FreeTrack and enjoy attention to detail and good flight models then it's a no brainer, just get the game already.","August 21, 2014","true","9.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The physics are something truely awesome. The graphics in game are good while allowing some more minor computers able to run the game. This game is a very detailed and realistic flight sim based around the WW1 Era that beats any other flight sim out there. The player community is very helpful and friendly. They will tell you how to get airborne and get to killing planes. Most of the negative reviews are because of the need to buy 95% of the planes in the game. I also find it rather rubbish that it cost so much, but I mean that is how most F2P game companies get their money. The only planes you start out with is a british biplane, a Rus biplane, and a german biplane. Now you can play with a mouse and keyboard, but is highly recommended to play with a flight stick and a track Ir. Overall, the mechanics, the graphics, hardware requirements, playerbase, I give this game a 9.5/10. (If you want to tell me how to improve more of my reviews, please do so in the comments.

The Sopwith Camel is excellent sim aircraft with real world stall/spin aircraft performance. The stall is preceded with aircraft shaking on the edge of a stall... then it lets loose to develop into a full blown gyro lock spin if the pilot does not act, the Camel will lock into a unrecoverable spin. It is the best SIMS Spin in the industry and recovery is ify,  you can not use standaed stall recovery in puts. The gyro lock must be prevented by forcing the camels nose down ; this is accomplished by pulling the nose up then down , nose up then push nose down and hold if the nose droppes positive toward ground.... then hold nose down and recover with hands off stick.  It helps to switch eng off throttle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ .  Positive speed and lift eng on throttle advanced.  It takes a few tries and helps to view the aircraft from  F2 view.

Frankly, I like it. I owned RoF years ago, standalone (non-steam) and even though my laptop BARELY ran it, it stuck with me. When I saw that it was available on steam as a free-to-try, I knew I had to see what it would do on my brand new custom gaming PC. I am ok with the idea of trying a somewhat neutered full version of a game, and then paying for the modules I want.\n\nYeah, when compared to the old days of IL-2, Combat Flight Sim, and the Jane's simulations, where you pay for the full program up front, and get all the content - no questions asked it seems a bit ridiculous. But to me, I see a major quality difference in a program like this. I paid $25 for the Channel Battle add-on, that seemed to bring the free version up to par with what would have been the in-store box edition years ago...that I paid i think $40 for. The planes really feel like what I would expect from them, judging from what I have read. I think that in todays simming age, so much more attention is paid to each individual aircraft, instead of a select few...I remember Microsoft Flight Sim 98, the first one to include virtual cockpits. The cessna 172s, and a couple others had it...but the boeing was a literal grey cardboard cutout you sat behind with NO gauges or anything. That was what your hard earned money got you. In ROF, you pay for each plane, but from what I can tell, they give the same thought and attention to detail to each plane in the lineup, so you get same type of experience in each seat.\n\nI like it, If you like the IL-2 installments, you'll like it too.","May 5","true","7.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I wanted to wait some time to be able to say something more about it.\n\nAt the beggining I must admit I was never a big fan of fly simulators but I've been fan of WWI aviation since I remember. Actually this game "forced" me to buy joystick because previous one was way way to responsive and was cause of many problems due to very light planes. Surprisingly I've never had any problems with DCS World - different kind of planes? I believe that after few years spring in my joystick was to soft at the crucial moments.\n\nVisuals are amazing and runs smooth on I3 3220 and 7870 on high details. I had to turn some of effects off obviously but thats understandable. Sound freeks me out when you diving and can actually feel that speed.\n\nLots of game modes - career, quick battles, missions, multiplayer. Like I said before - 100h already and I don't even fell that I achieved anything. Multi still alive but unfortunately you'll have to content oneself with FEW servers. When I type few I mean two max three. They're nerver full but It doesn't affect gameplay. All you need is 8-12 planes maybe bit more to have fun and spend some nice quality time with new friends. Because community is so small people are very friendly and happy to help everytime when you need advice. They will cover you, help and make you feel comfy. Lets be honest. Learning curve is very demanding and without internal help you won't be able to be compatitive. Some of them play from release day and there is no chance you will even approach them in combat. They fly on the edge and know every weaknes of your plane. I'm wondering... maybe just because that game is so difficult makes it so rewarding? EVERY single plane shot down in multiplayer makes you happy and smile instantly and you know by the time it's something. It's not a next random kill in FPS game - at least I feel it in that way.\n\nDo I recommend that game? YES. Oh yes. RoF is expensive if you'd like to buy all DLC at once but there is no need to do it. Few monts ago RoF was in some bundle and can be available on steamtrades easily. Even the basic version provide high quality of fun for many hours. What I do is: I just buy on every sale some DLC and improve my gameplay and experience. Spent 30 flying my career with Nieuport 17 and after that time I bought DLC with weapons upgrade. What you can do is install additional guns in your planes to increase firepower. Not only this but thats the main reason. After that change I was exited to spend next 30 or more hours flying the same plane cose it gained new quality.\n\nHopefully this helps.","May 4, 2014","true","77.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It is highly atmospheric and the aircraft all have a good individual feel to them. It is a lot of fun and conveys a great sense of the air conflict over the trenches of the First World War. The free-to-play version comes with 3 great aircraft, although there is a bit of a learning curve to get started.\n\n\nCautions:\n\nThe Steam version of the game and the Rise of Flight Store version can not be mixed, you need to go one route or the other. Both variants can participate in all the multiplayer servers though.\nThe free-to-play version has 3 aircraft enabled: SPAD C13, Albatros D.Va and Nieuport 17. Many new players get confused by picking campaign dates or multiplayer maps for which these aircraft are not valid.\nSome multi-player servers have full-engine realism enabled, making it tricky for newcomers to figure out how to switch on the engine and get started. It is not hard, but you do need to check the manual/guides/videos to find out how.\nSteam achievements do not work. This is very disappointing for those of us who enjoy the Steam achievement system.\nWhile mouse-and-keyboard play are possible to get started, a joystick is strongly recommended.\n\nFull review:\n\nRise of Flight is a flight-simulator for the First World War. The atmospheric is great and the graphics are lovely, albeait a little dated now. There is a good selection of aircraft and a reasonable range of multiplayer servers and scenarios to keep you enthralled. The base game is free-to-play, and there are two ways to purchase add-ons: either through Steam (with DLCs) or the Rise of Flight Store (with individual items). You cannot mix the two methods (I went with the Steam option).\n\nIt is not an arcade game, but should be treated as a serious simulator. As such, there are a lot of keys to map, and a lots of things to learn. We often see newcomers turn up and have trouble figuring out how to start their aeroplane or take off (tip: search on the Internet for videos on getting started in Rise of Flight).\n\nThe setting is compelling and there are a range of weathers, times of day, maps and settings. Targets are many and varied and there is a great selection of aircraft to fly against, from bombers to scouts to seaplanes. The aircraft seem fragile and occasional gun jams, mechanical failures and a rough feel enhance the title. This is the only sim where I've managed to suspend disbelief and truly feel in the environment.\n\nThere are some flaws (see the cautions above), but these are minor compared to the many features offered by the rest of the sim. In total, if you purchase all the modules, it can be pretty expensive. But you can either be selective (like me) or wait for sales or discounts. One recommended DLC for those who go with the Steam version is the Channel Battles, as it adds the English Channel Map (excellent) and a great selection of fine aircraft.\n\nDespite its age and somewhat confusing purchase model, this is nonetheless a worthy simulator and comes highly recommended.","May 18","true","236.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I waited for a discount sale on the addons and got 4 of them. Without discount all the STEAM addons would have been quite expensive. I remember RB3D had more planes and was far cheaper.. around $40 when it was released. Now its on STEAM for far less and if you have a Glide wrapper the graphics are fairly good for an old title.\n\nFor a more modern version of RB3D this ROF title is a reasonable move up for graphics, reasonable authenticity, and interface. If they made a batch sale for all aircraft and addons I think it would get a lot more attention, especially considering it is already several years old.\n\nOverall I do recommend it since you can play it with a few planes for free and then decide which addons to purchase from there.\n\nThanks.","May 2","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The few complaint I have read about is the purchasing of add ons which to me isn't a big deal because the basic game has more planes and stuff than any other WW1 flight sim. It also has night fighting of WW1 which is a added bonus. The other complaint was about the complex nature of the game because it accurately represents what real flight in WW1 is about.

You can very easily set up your own missions and set strange goals for yourself such as taking down a bomber by dropping a bomb on it or shooting rockets at it.  The physics are pretty great, with structural damage taking toll if you maneuver to quickly or go to fast.  The damage model is quite detailed too, something I always look for in flight games.\n\nGameplay problems mainly revolve around AI.  Enemy bomber gunners have eagle vision, able to hit and critically damage your plane from a kilometer out and while you maneuver, disabling your engine with one shot, or blowing your wing off before you can even identify what plane it is.  This can be intensely aggravating ,and it doesn't help that your AI partners are completely inept, flying in a straight line behind the gunners, just letting them fire away at them.\n\nOf course you can't really ignore the main negative I have with this game: the pay model is ridiculous.  In order to unlock everything for this game, you have to pay $179.90...That's ridiculous.  And it's not like they give you much to start with...3 planes, and a couple of missions.  If you wanted to buy all the planes, nothing else, it would STILL be over $100\n\nThat said I can still have fun with 3 planes, and so I'm going to recommend it","July 5, 2015","true","23.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

(2yrs old, onboard graphics, no graphics card)\nI suppose you might argue that since it's only serious predecessor is Red Baron II it was bound to look pretty good! I've not flown a huge number of WW1 aircraft :-) , but I'm guessing that it gives a very good simulation of this. One area that I do think is a bit suspect however, is the weapons' effect. In my last flight I was firing 2 machine guns at a couple of guys in a wood and canvas box from less that 50 metres, without causing them too much distress as far as I could see. In the real world I'm about average with a machine gun, all be it from a firm bipod not the engine cowling of a Sopwith Camel, but even so there is no way they would walk away from that!\nNow the bad news - Like almost all flight sims this is a pretty awful "game".  What it cries out for is a "gaming mode" alongside the undoubtedly excellent "simulation mode", with things like the field of view from the cockpit, and a host of other stuff made much more user-friendly. Well worth the bargain price I paid for it,(£16) but don't pay more unless you are a real flight sim nut.","February 16, 2014","true","10.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VRaven27/recommended/244050/","VRaven27","Vermilion Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VRaven27/","279 products in account","Probably my favorite game as a kid was Knights of the Sky, a WW1 flight sim on DOS. I played that game for hours on end, day after day. Nothing like flying around and dueling with enemies in three dimentions. Getting within 50 meters trying to put a hole in their engine. Great times. RoF comes back to the awesomeness of those deadly duels above the trenches of WW1, and does it modern justice with awesome flight models that take realistic damage, and great physics to the point where flying in 10m/s winds is a hell of a chore.\n\nAlthough the game gets exponentially more fun the more realistic you set the simulation, you can simplify the physics to make things like wind no longer a factor, and you can add gauges to your hud which will also tell you the limits you can push your plane at the current moment, and finally you can add icons so you don't have to manually spot the planes against the horizon or down over the trenches. This can be exceptionally useful for new players to the flight sim genre, expecially of the hardcore WW1 variety. There is a reason there's the saying "any landing you can walk away from is a good landing".\n\nThere are currently about 30 different airplanes (almost a 50/50 split, but the Entente do have a handle more to choose from). Most of the planes fly completely differently, its usually not just "oh the Fokker D.VII is all around better than the Fokker Dr.1". The D.VII might be more of a standard all around fighter with fairly high specs, while the Dr.1 tends to buck like a horse at the rodeo. But in the hands of an Ace the Dr.1 can be a terrifying aircraft. Werner Voss took on 7 S.E.5a planes on his own with a Dr.1 shooting down two and damaging all of the other five. There are some vast differences in how each plane flies, giving each easily 100 hours of replayability if not more.\n\nOne of the biggest attractions of this game is the career mode, which given WW1's unique setting of largely unchanging front lines allows for random missions for your fictional pilot to fly, rather than pre-scripted storyline missions like most WW2 flying sims. Getting random missions to patrol behind enemy lines, scramble to intercept recon/bomber planes, attacking balloons, etc. just helps keep the game fresh as you fly your pilot into the history books trying to catch up to Richthofen's score. Take it from me, I've played 100 hours and I haven't even tackled the other half of the game yet, multiplayer.\n\nI can't really review multiplayer as I haven't played it at all yet. But watching some videos, it's not just shoot down enemy planes. Rather you have objectives, photograph facilities, bomb tanks, destroy AI flights, etc. to earn points to bring victory to your side; all the while keeping your eyes to sky, watching for other players who are much better pilots than the AI and who are ready to swoop down on you.\n\nTo get all of the dlc, it costs quite a pretty penny. But it is so worth it in my opinion. There is nothing like starting up another mission in your career, climbing up to 2km, spotting an enemy a kilometer below you and swooping down on them, hoping you don't destroy your engine in the process or rip off you own wings coming out of your dive. This game runs the gamut from relaxing flight among the clouds to adrenaline pumping dog fights were you don't even know if your pilot is gonna live to keep flying. If you have any interest in dogfighting, this is hands down the best game on market for it.","August 25, 2014","true","242.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a sim and you will have to learn how to fly.\n\nAbout:\nThis one gives you 3 free planes.\nthe albatros d5a which is a rly good (and forgiving for noobs) plane.\nthe spad 13 a rly good if not the best boom and zoom plane on entety side!\nand a nieuport i havent flown yet.\n\nyou can acces all the content with these planes so single playe careers and mission\nyou can also go on a multiplayer server that runs these planes (the albatros is available on almost every map!)\n\nThe community made their own seperate carreer it's a mod they made you can find it on the rise of flight official forum.\n\nIf you go multiplayer it's NOT pay to win it's all about knowing your plane!\ni have not gone online a lot but i can say most pilots there are good to even better then good and playing this game for a long time.\nthey will teach you things if you ask. anfd if you are willing to learn you to can enjoy yourself here.\n\nIn time you probably will buy more DLC's as i did :p\n\nHappy hunting and hope to see you in the air soon.","May 14","true","479.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is amazing. Yes it sucks that you have to buy the extra planes for you to fly, DCS does this and it doesn't bother me in either.\n\nThis is the best WW1 flight sim that I have encountered. Period. The flight and damage models are impeccible, with little holes getting blown through wings with them beautifuly getting ripped off after you shoot some supports. The game models CEM (Complex Engine Management) where you have to worry about the temperature, RPM, oil, and raidiator to keep your plane flying. This alone would be enough for me to buy this game at a 50$ price tag and be happy with singleplayer campaigns.\n\nBut that's not all. It has created campaigns sure, but there are also dynamic careers. You pick what date you want to start, what plane, with what squadron, all in accurate historical detail. The missions are layed out wonderfully to me, where each "day" in game has multiple sorties. Sometimes you take part in just one, or all, or even none. The missions range from various patrols, recon, and escort missions to name a few.\n\nThe missions are even pretty realistic. Sometimes you have a mission where nothing happens at all. And yes, it is boring, but I like that more than always knowing theres going to be some action.\n\nThis was all just the singleplayer so far. I haven't done much in multiplayer or the editor yet, so I can't comment on them. Just know this, you can get the base game with 3 planes for free, with access to all of this content. Why not just download it and try it out? I have bought only one pack for this, it came with 8 planes and cost me 20$. I love my new planes and I plan on buying more eventually.\n\nThis sim is excellent and very addicting, 9/10\n\n","April 19","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I couldnt enjoy it with just one or two screens. Since i got a third...its simply a blast to play. I need a large field of view or I cant keep track of my opponents. And I want to see the passing landscape below my wings. You will need a flight stick (pref. HOTAS) and pedals are a nice addition)\n\n\nCons:\n- Enemies despawn in front of the player, if they get too far away from your flight leader.\n- DLC's and price politics are confusing.\nIf you buy here on steam, you cant use the original online shop and vice versa. Or so i have been told.\nAvailable career starting dates depend if you have the historical correct plane available for that time window.\nIf you buy a dlc you get maybe one or two planes that you want and need for your carreer and two or more that you did not want, but paid for anyway.\n\nJust as an example:\nGerman carreer from 1916:\n\nThe most interesting plane to start with would be:\nFokker IIIE --> You need the Birth of warbirds DLC\n\nAfter just 3 weeks in career the Fokker is obsolete and you want the:\nAlbatros DII --> You need the Bloody April DLC\n\nWhich is followed by the:\nAlbatros DIII --> You need the Furious Wings DLC\n\nIf you want to obtain later on the most powerful engine for the Fokker D.VII:\nFokker D.VIIF --> You need the Ultimately the Best Fighter DLC\n\nYou see. To play the german carreer from beginning to end, you will probably buy 4 DLC's. You can work around some of the dlc's by choosing less powerful or popular planes. But anyway, it would be way more customer friendly if you could buy one dlc with all the planes from one country.\n\nBut still. My verdict is that this game offers tons and tons of content and a superb flight feeling for a reasonable price! The planes and dlcs go regularly on sale and large junks of the carreer can be played with the planes that are for free. So there is no excuse. Hop in and give it a try.","May 21","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

You want to feel what it's like flying a wooden coffin with paper wings and wind rushing your face? Look no further. After mastering a few aircrafts, you'll feel like a pro keeping your plane airborne without any autopilot or trimming systems. Trying to score a kill is another story. While a daunting task to be proficient, you'll forget about some of the frustration and marvel at the gorgeous French and English scenery at 3000m altitude without any parachute to save you if something goes wrong.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/splode26/recommended/244050/","splode26","Splode","http://steamcommunity.com/id/splode26/","187 products in account","This is a really fun flight sim.\n\nThis is a game where you can jack up the realism settings to maximum and still have a good time. All the annoying boring parts of flightsims, like propeller feathering, fuel mixture, radiator settings, radar calibration, complicated start up sequences? None of those have been invented yet.\nNeither have parachutes.\n\nOn top of that, WW1 dogfights are in many ways even more fun than dogfights in WW2 aircraft. The planes are slower, more agile, and more fragile, so you can't just dive in from fifty million feet and wipe someone out before they have a chance to respond. You can try it, but your wings will snap off when you pull up. Engagements are terrifyingly close, and collision is always a very real threat, or option, depending on how much of a maniac you are.\n\nDogfights also last a lot longer. The planes are reasonably tough by virtue of effectively being large kites. If you don't hit the engine or the pilot, you won't do much more than superficial damage. Most of the planes carry plenty of bullets, too, so you'll get at least one extended dogfight per mission even if you waste ammunition.\n\nThe demo version, available on the website, lets your friends fly two very good planes for free, or occupy any gunner position in any aircraft, so you can get your friends to play with you even if they're broke and don't own a joystick. It's a generous move that makes up for the irritating DLC model used for the rest of the game.","May 26, 2015","true","53.6"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","2"

When I checked it out, I was blown away. Yes, the DLC may seem a bit overpriced, but when you get down to the nitty-gritty dogfighting, you will understand that the amount of work put into making the flight and damage models is immense.\n\nTo the knowledgeable person, the selection of aircraft may seem a bit limited, but it is well thought out. All roles in all periods are accounted for, except an early French reconnaissance plane.\n\nThe learning curve is steep, certainly for a novice flight simmer. However it is managable to get reasonably good in a short amount of time. Dogfighting is difficult, but very rewarding. You'd be best to buy a joystick that has a rudder functionality, you'll need it. A lot.\n\nGenerally, there are two types of planes: rotary engines and in-line engines. Rotaries are hard to master, but with some practice, you can let them work in your favour. Just keep turning right. In-line engines are somewhat less maneuverable, you will have to rely on altitude, speed, and surprise. Again, practice a lot in quick missions and career mode.\n\nMultiplayer wise, if you think you are good enough, still expect to be shot down a lot. It happens to everyone.\n\nOverall, a very detailed game with a lot of potential. Also, don't forget to download the historical skin packs from their site.","June 4, 2015","true","177.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","11","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rykemasters/recommended/244050/","rykemasters","Ryke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rykemasters/","284 products in account","It seems to me like at least some of the negative reviews on this game must be outdated. I was expecting to be very disappointed by the very limited content available for free, and actually I wasn't.\n\nBut first things first: it's true that this game isn't really free-to-play. It might be better described as a demo or a fairly limited free trial. But for a demo or a free trial, one gets a lot of content. You get three planes, (but one of them only seems to be available for skirmish battles, as it has no standalone missions, and is a Russian plane while the career mode takes place on the Western Front, making that plane unusable) plus a couple of standalone missions for two of those planes, plus the training campaign, and full career mode with the two planes you have access to, and limited multiplayer access. All in all, pretty good.\n\nNot being a sim enthusiast, I don't have a joystick or pedals, which would be necessary to best enjoy the game. But I'll say this: there are easy-to-use mouse controls, and there's joystick + keyboard controls. Keyboard-only controls are pretty much just not good enough for this game. Those planes are hard to fly and require fairly constant and fine input even just to get off the ground, which makes it basically impossible to fly halway competently with just the keyboard. I managed to take off with keyboard controls a few times, but never gracefully; without pedals or a twist joystick for finer rudder control, I couldn't prevent the plane from swerving left or right when taking off, I could only keep it under control long enough to pick up the 80km/h necessary to take off. I suppose this could be improved (hell, I think the options might even already allow you to make some of the keys more responsive and help with that issue, but I haven't done the necessary tinkering) but I'd say it's a case of the simulation accuracy simply requiring better tools than a keyboard.\n\nThe mouse controls are definitely very much easy mode, but don't take away all of the challenge; the plane does its best to get to wherever you point, keeps level on its own, but you have to watch altitude and speed, avoid making moves that would rip your wings apart (not always easy in the middle of a dogfight on those old planes) and, generally, it doesn't lose the feeling of realism. What it does obviously lose is the feeling that you're the one piloting. However, you can switch between keyboard and mouse controls in the middle of a mission, and this does allow you to get a feel for how precise and difficult the simulation is, while also being able to actually play the game competently without all the tools. But obviously, if you want the full sim experience, you're going to need a joystick, either with a twist function or some pedals.\n\nDespite the fiddly keyboard controls, I can both take off and stay in the air (maneuvering very clumsily) with them, so I'd say the learning curve is manageable, at least for basic piloting. Really competent dogfighting seems like it would take a lot of practice, but it seems like one could get a lot out of the game with only a bit of practice. Flying those planes is hard, and you might find your engine failing over no man's land because you pushed it just a bit too hard, but generally, most things are easy enough to do that you can manage them, while also being hard enough that you get a great sense of pride out of managing them properly. I might buy a high-quality joystick for this game, it seems like it'd be worth it.\n\nAnd of course, the pricing for the paid content in this game (IE most of the content) is pretty high. It's obviously marketed towards sim enthusiasts who'll pay good money for it. However, you can get a good number of hours out of this game for free, and buy extra planes or campaigns much later, if at all. I do wish they'd sell it cheaper, but this is a sim and its main target is a fairly small market which couldn't get all that much bigger even if they sold it super cheap.\n\nAll in all, if it interests you, try it. You have nothing to lose, and there's more content available for free than the reviews seem to be saying. Yes, most of the game's content is for sale at a high price, which is a bit off-putting, but you can simply get everything you can out of the free content, or possibly just buy the content one bit at a time, spacing it out over time so you never pay a ton at once.","August 26, 2015","true","16.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't be a dumpass! Don't be a shiity kindergarten boyz!\nIt's a PC FLIGHT SIMULATOR!!! Not the Flight ShootShiiting Game!!!\nYou need to learn how to take off, how to turn, how to BFM, how to shooting and how to landing safty!

You spot a plane, check your compass, his heading could mean enemy or friendly, dive to gain speed, he's spotted you, you're zoomed in as much as possible, wind is blasting your ears, muffling the spluttering engine. Sights are on him, heart's pumping, check for stoppage in the machine guns, trigger set, here we go, aaaaaand it's a friendly. Wave off, Never mind\n\nThe game itself is fantastic, great flight model. Multiplayer that has population (for now) and doesnt babysit you. It forces you to respect your engine and airspeed, windage, ammunition and fuel load. Most flight sims do this, but only in RoF have i managed to play a good multiplayer match that doesn't hold your hand.\n\nAll of this would be so grand if they didnt rip me off on available planes. Some nutsack in marketing at 777 decided that purchasing the game will only give you 5-6 planes, when they had created over 20 for the game. I'm used to seeing this on flight simulators, but unless I can click panel buttons and instruments, 25 dollars for 2 planes and a field modification is not good enough for digital distribution.\n\nI joined a multiplayer map where I hadn't purchased any of the planes available for the map and so only had the choice of being a gunner.

I was prepared to go through some contortions to get this beautiful looking game to work to relive my old Red Baron (original) days.  Download the "free" game, go through the trouble to register at the company site, then open a game that can't be played unless you submit to a scheme of having to buy THE PLANES in a way that I just didn't want to sit there and figure out.  What you get for free is basically the game shell/engine, with none of what you need to actually play.  IOW, the menu screens.  You'll need to download certain aircraft packs for certain missions, certain time periods, etc.  Then I see on the DLC tab that it's $180 to DL all the actual content of the game.  Maybe they can get the newer generation of gamers to be that stupid, but I remember getting games like this complete in a box for $40-50 new.  I'd even be willing to pay that for this now.  But $180 for a game already several years old? ...f that.  If I get a notice that the content is on significant discount (a previous sale was 66%) I'd consider that fair and probably jump back in.\n\n\nIn the meantime. I'm gonna go throw $10 at the old Red Baron II game or just live with my Il-2 games.","May 5","false","12.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","2"

And the prices for extra planes, mods, etc, are reasonably priced. Especially for the extra horus of fun you can add on when you get a new aircraft. In this, you start with the basic and famous planes of the war. The Fokker D.VIIF, Dr.1, Albatross D.Va, Sopwith Camel, Nieuport 17(including a Russian version) and 28. S.E.5a, SPAD 13, Pfalz D.XII and a Felixstowe F2a floatplane.

The flight models are horrible even using a joystick, and you cannot get a steady aim on anything in the air or the ground.\n\nThe aircraft don't want to fly in level flight so it is a constant struggle with the joystick which gets old fast.\n\nYou are basically bouncing all over the sky to reach an objective.\n\nAnyone who has flown real aircraft will know these are horrible flight models.\n\nI cannot understand why developers create beautiful aircraft and scenery, the things we fans have waited decades for, then ruin a game by unsteady flight models deemed as "realism". If developers could create steady flight models that self trim when in flight and leveling off, like the Microsoft CFS series, then I could handle any realism they throw at me.\nBut struggling to keep an aircraft trimmed or in level flight is not fun.\n\nAn ingame example is: Why if I am flying at 100 km per hour in a shallow dive that I cannot keep my gunsite on a ground target? My gunsite should, at that speed, be fixed on a target not shaking left, right, up and down.","November 21, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Now, this is a flight simulator. The feeling of flight is fantastic, your canvas and wood planes shake and rock about as the wind buffets your machine around all over the place. Every plane is modelled fantastically and the wings literally bend under weight or if they collide with something, brackets snap and bullets will go through both wings if shot at the right angle.\n\nThis isn't Warthunder, or World of Warplanes. This is a simulator. Meant to simulate world war one planes to a detail that is as close to reality as possible without being the real thing. Because of this, getting blueprints and performance statistics for each and every aircraft that they add, costs money. It also requires a lot of time and devotion to get their simulated aircraft to a degree of realism that is unbeatable by any other Great War flight sim.\n\nMy only complaint about it is that I don't have the money to spend on them myself, but the few packs that I do have I love, and I've played this game before it arrived to steam. As far as games go this day, this companies business model is fantastic, and a lot of the regulars of this game would likely agree with me wholeheartedly.","April 12","true","19.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you say dont feel like full on hardcore simulator today you better find another game because there is NO way to make this play like arcade bad luck.\n\nAll and all I would not recomend this game at all it seem we have to wait little longer for good WWI flight game.\n\nGame Score: 2/10","May 30","false","9.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

I had purchased Channel Battles a while back, and just finally got around to playing it.\n\nGreat flight mechanics, appropriate learning curve, and a lot of fun! The first time you manage to win a dogfight feels like a real triumph... no arcade physics here (unless you turn on "simple physics", because you are slow or something...).\n\nThe game is best played with a proper flight stick. Compared to IL2 or other WWII combat sims, this game is definitely up there with realism. The lack of performance of these old planes makes the game more difficult, and tactics even more important. A lot of these old planes don't have the power to pull themselves out of trouble, so you better set up your approach right the first time! I'm definitely still learning, as it has been a while since I've played a serious flight sim.\n\nI don't mind the DLC strategy for this one. Even adding a bunch of stuff, I've put less money into this than a AAA game.\n\nSo far, my favorite thing has been in a Brandenburg W12 seaplane, dogfighting against multiple Felixstowe F.2A turret-ships (also a seaplane...haha). I took out two of them in a row, and went to land on the water... only noticing after I landed that one of my pontoons looked like swiss cheese, so one side of my plane sunk and killed the engine.\n\nI also was flying a Fokker DRI and said "why the eff is the plane doing left-hand circles when my stick is centered?". Blipped the engine off and it stopped.... durr, gyroscopic precession from the engine assembly spinning. Auto-rudder is for chumps :) I love this game.","October 30, 2015","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have always loved flight sims, from the X-Wing Alliance games to IL-2 and I have to say, this one took me by storm. For the longest time I have always wanted a WW1 themed flight sim and I am pleased with what I have purchased. Though I do admit, it can be a pain to pay for each plane individually, it is a sacrifice I am willing to make for a game so well done and polished out. As a history buff, I enjoy having a plane that is modeled and flies similar to the real machines that took to the skies nearly a century ago. Having also purchased most of the plane packs on sale, I have to say this game really gives me a run for my money and has brought hours upon hours of entertainment, and some frustration (those who have ever flown the Gotha will understand why I say that). In all, this game is absolutely amazing and worth every penny I have invested into it.","October 27, 2015","true","60.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have played the non steam version of ROF on and off since it was released years ago. IF you like real flight SIMS (example: IL 2) and like or love WWWI era areoplanes/games/sims (example: Red Baron) you will like or love this game. If you want to be the baddest pilot on the block in a weekend you will hate this title,   lol.  Now I enjoy and play  WOT, WOWS , War Thunder, AW etc, just becasue you like, or think you are competitive in an arena shooter does not equate to being any good at all or enjoying a flight sim. They are not the same thing at all those arena games are for the most part "dumbed down" and  are MADE  and constanlty changed to be appealing to the broadest section of potential online gamers as possible. Even War Thunder in simulator mode is no sim not even close. World of Tanks, World of Warships , Armored Warfare, World of Warplanes (ha!) none of those are. They are all fun  GAMES, I love to play them also, but they are not simulators. That's just a fact.   So just becasue you like or think WG or WT are great  does not mean you will like Rise of Flight it is a SIM , not  an arena fps shooter dressed up to look like a simulator. If you require instant gratification ala WOT or WOWS , WT. And you do not like spending time learning to actually fly your virtual A/C, and then spend more time learning to fight said A/C then you will not like this title.  As for as the DLC if you dont like the game you dont have to buy the DLC . As a matter of fact you should not by ANY DLC untill you know you like the sim or not, you get 3 fighters for free now.That it a LOT of hours of flying time to decide if you can even handle RoF. And you can do pretty much anything you like. If you have RoF long enough to master one of those three airplanes then you might want to start buying DLC and you do not need to get all the DLC maybe two or three tops and you can fight the whole airwar in europe. There are some wonderful guides to what DLC you need to get for what you want to do.  RoF is defninelty not for everybody and it is not an arena mode FPS game like WoT , etc. It is however a nice old school combat sim and I like it quite a lot.","September 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You get one plane for free the rest are in DLC packs or can be bought individually on the website. The free plane is decent but limits you to the end of the war in French Airforce. in career mode. Takes some getting used to and Joystick is a must.\n\neasily one of my favorite games honestly, and one of the few that actually makes me a little nervous everytime i get into the pilot seat. With the Career mode ending if you die or get captured, it makes you think twice about engaging that plane.  and you can die from alot more than just being shot down.\n\nif you play it right and let yourself get immersed in the game, youll find yourself doing things you never would in other games, like actually not even wanting to attack a crippled plane.\n\nThere are very few games, that I know of that you want to defeat your oponent, but don't really want to kill him. It is very real bitter-sweet feeling when you're in a long dogfight and your guns break the enemy's wing in half and you see him tumbling to the ground helplessly. You're happy to be alive, happy to have won, but at the same time theres something...ominous about watching a plane flail, knowing the pilot is going through his final moments.\n\nIts gotten to the point that I don't even aim for the wings anymore, and I've shot out a few guy's engines just to escort them down to the ground in hopes that they survive. Really puts those old WWI fighter pilot's stories of Honor, and mutual respect into perspective.","January 17","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game isn't new, but it is well supported, and one of the best flight sims to date, as it has better physics and damage models than most. Drop $25 or $50 on one or two of the main expansions, and you'll get a nice number of planes to fly. You can, however, put AI in any plane from the get go, which is nice.

Once you get comfortable with the free planes there are frequent sales on the DLC packs.\n\nCurious about flying but confused by the trillions of buttons in a modern fighter jet?\nLearn to fly like the true knights of the air - with stick, rudder and nothing but a crude RPM gauge. There is no more honest and honorable way to fight in flight, and even when you think you're ready to move on to other sims,  RoF will pull you back time and time again. If it doesn't, well, maybe you belong on the ground.\n\nLet me get this out of the way - It is a fully fledged simulator, with a complex flight and damage model and it will take you time to learn. Hell, taking off in a crosswind will cost the Kaiser many airframes before you even get off the ground. Your first kill in multiplayer will take practice and disaster. The planes are built of matchsticks and bedsheets, powered by lawnmowers and liable to break apart if you mistreat them. So...uh...Don't mistreat them.\n\nI can honestly say that I look forward to see you cripple my Albatros with a well-placed burst of moustachio'd machine-gun fire.

It's also a good simulator of WW I aircraft.\n\nThat said, there are better.  And cheaper.  For this game's retail value, one of its competitors offers 54 or 55 airplanes, compared to the small handful in this game, and while the graphics aren't quite as good as RoF - they're still excellent.\n\nIn order to play a campaign of any length of time, you really need to go beyond this starter pack and invest in some of the DLC.  I suppose what did it for me was spending half an hour trying to find a squad I COULD fly for, then by sheer luck the very next day that squad switched out to a new set of aircraft, and would I like to buy that airplane?\n\nIt's worth nothing that while you COULD just buy one plane at a time through RoF's site, here you're investing in DLC 'packs.'  Overall this starter set is an effort to get you interested enough to invest more heavily and buy all their DLC.  Only then will you have close to a complete game.  Again, compared to at least one competitor which gives you everything from 1915 two-seaters through to the Armistice...it's a no brainer.\n\n","June 4, 2014","false","20.8"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","2"

Controls were great, proper mapping, didn't need to change but one or two buttons on my joystick. Create the mission, get my plane setup, ready to launch. Mission is cancelled, becaue the only plane I'm able to select is either unavailable to my account, or the file was modified. Seeing as how I just downloaded this game, the only logical explanation was that I couldn't use the only plane I was able to select. I tried launching three missions, and every time I was unable to figure out how to select another plane.\n\nI went  to the forums looking for assistance as to how to fix this issue, couldn't find any posts for it. I posted a question on what I'm doing wrong. Just out of curiosity, I tried to relaunch the game in order to see if I can't figure it out on my own.

Oops! Rise of Flight United\n\nYour gaming experience will be quite limited, you need to buy the DLC to continue in the game, it is more like a demo than a real free-to-play or a better description would be "Limited Free-To-Play". You also need to create another account in the developer's website to be able to play this.\n\nAs a WWI Simulator it is very good visually (great graphics)/aurally (nice sound set), enemy AI are impressive, and the flght physics? Very realistic! well, I just took the word of the "Pros" in the field of flight simulator: maybe they are real pilots and who have flown these birds in real life or they may be in the field of aeronautics and have authority to judge a flight sim's "fidelity". The control is good when you have defined them to your liking but it is not that easy and frankly, I think it is also very limited in a way (at least for me).\n\n\nSo, for being a "Limited FTP" I would say "No" for my recommendation rating. I could not recommend it for anyone who is not ready to spend for a DLC or two. But, if you could then for sure you'll very much enjoy this simulator! as I have ... for a limited time.","April 29","false","12.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","2","7","2","1"

There are hardly any aircraft to fly ingame and the most interesting ones require further purchase, sad considering I have just spent £30.00, not impressed.\n\nThe game is difficult and has a very steep learning curve, stick with it it is rewarding. It looks gorgeous and plays very well, if you like WW1 and WW1 flight sims you cant go wrong with this gameplay wise however I think the price is very steep, I would gladly pay the price if all the content was there from the start.

I love watching my pilot rise through the ranks.........But heres the real kicker the DLC. MY GOD THE DLC.......30$ FOR NEW PLANES THAT SHOULD ALREADY BE IN THE GAME  WHAT IS THIS.......I CAN BUY A WHOLE NEW GAME FOR THAT, and all your really getting is some new planes and one campaigns.There is not a SNOWBALLS CHANCE IN HELL! im paying that much for DLC and getting so little for it.

Neither is it for me. If you're a fan of aerial combat, just stick to War Thunder. To me, the game, while more realistic, is almost nothing BUT flying. At least that added in that time control feature, but I find myself abusing the ♥♥♥♥ out of it more than I should be. That's how you know how just uneventful the game can be.\n\nAnd when I saw Squire on YouTube playing the game, I thought the dogfights looked awesome. I was horribly, horribly, wrong. Trying to aim at planes is a horrible job. You'll constantly won't be able to see anything due to your wing, you'll constantly lose the enemy due to low visibillity. I know it's supposed to be a simulator, but I'm just trying to convince anyone who wants arcade like action shouldn't pick up this game.\n\nHowever, if you like the look of WWI aerial combat (that is boringly realistic), you could consider this game, but once again, I expected more fast paced action from this title. Very, very disappointed with this game.","June 29, 2015","false","16.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

But when they made it, they forgot to put in the fun.\n\nAs a simulation, well, maybe it's great.  Maybe it simulates the Western Front down to Planck-length detail.  I assume it does, and in that respect, well done.  But this awesomeness (if it exists) is hidden behind so many rookie UI screwups and a learning curve so steep, it's a learning wall.  As a game, one you might want to play, it's just terrible.  It feels like it was designed by Skynet: beautiful, accurate, soulless, and with no idea of how actual human beings work.\n\nFirst off, on loading up, you have to log in.  That's not so bad - except the 'create new account' button was off the bottom of my screen, and moving the task bar didn't help.  A quick visit to the forums told me I had to edit the .cfg file.  Well, I thought, that's a minor lapse, probably something to do with Steam integration.  I could overlook that.\n\nIn game, the text looks like it was written by a non-native English speaker: it's stilted and imprecise.   Well, I thought: small indie studio, they take what they can get.  So I overlooked that, and what is literally the worst voice acting I've ever heard in thirty years of gaming - I came to fly, not for the story!\n\nThen I started the training missions.  They are not good.  No, sir, they are not.  If you fail, you have to start again from the top.  They are also timed.  Why is a training mission timed?   Why is there no cue to tell you when you've flown through a ring successfully?  (More than once I was searching for the next ring to fly through, which hadn't appeared yet, because I'd missed the previous ring and thought I'd got it.  And other times I turned around to get a ring I thought, mistakenly, I'd narrowly missed.)\n\nAt one point, you need to climb up to a green checkpoint from ground level.  The mission tells you to turn left and climb. But it's almost impossible to do in a straight climb; one veteran player on a forum speculated it was to test your initiative, to see if you were smart enough to turn around and climb in a spiral.  Later on, you're told to throw your plane into a stall - I spent two hours trying, literally, to make my plane fall down in a way that the mission would recognize as doing what it wants.\n\nI thought the point of training scenarios were to help newbies learn.  But I am coming to the conclusion the training missions in Rise of Flight are there to weed out the Insufficiently Faithful.  The attitude is common on the forums - Rise of Flight newbies come in, complain about little things like 'my guns won't fire' (Quick Mission, by default, throws you in without ammunition; you need to tell it specifically you want your guns loaded) and veteran players get snippy because they think knuckledragging arcade jockeys are asking for the game to be dumbed down.  I'm not; I am just asking for the game to suck less.\n\nOf the many UI failures, I'll have to single out the view controls as the worst.  There are several ways of looking around - with the game camera, or with your pilot's head. The game uses multiple head snap modes, with the hat control on the joystick, to look different directions.  But the game doesn't have an indication tell you which head snap mode you are in: you could be in 'look in the direction the hat control is pushed, then back to front when it is released' or 'turn your head roughly in the direction the hat control is pushed, and keep it there' or some other mode - I think there are three, but I'm not sure, because there's no indication on the screen to tell you.\n\nI eventually mastered the view controls (by completely reconfiguring the key and joystick mappings) to the point where they'd only kill me maybe one mission in twenty or so.  (Did I mention that, by default, the mouse controls your view as well?  So if you're playing with a joystick and you maybe perhaps breathe on the mouse a little too hard suddenly you're looking way off up to the left, instead of the big flat green surface rushing towards you from below?)\n\nI turned on the gimp settings (simplied physics, easy controls) and tried to play a couple of non-training scenarios for fun.  But even when I shot down a two-seater, my heart just wasn't in it any more.  The sheer awfulness of Rise of Flight had made the soft gooey accurate-simulation center unappealing.  It felt like hard work, and I'm not even sure whether my opponent crashed because my shooting had a delayed reaction, or because the AI just didn't know how to avoid the ground in a spiralling dogfight at treetop level.\n\nSo I can't recommend this game.  I would go so far to as say I hate it.  I hate it because I tried to love it, and it just didn't care.  I wish the developers ill.\n\n\n","February 28, 2014","false","7.7"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","1"

When games state that they have Full Controller Support, 99% of the time it means that the game will work with an Xbox controller or something similar.\n\nI would say its almost a fraudulent to claim that this game has full controller support. Every other game that claims it has full controller support has at least one controller layout to use. In the control options for this game I can't see anything that that says enable xbox cotroller or anything of that type.\n\nBecause of that one thing which is actually a major deal breaker for just about anyone who would use a game pad or xbox controller, I am not recommending this game, a company that would claim full controller support then not offer it, is not a company in my opinion that has any kind of ethical conduct whatsoever.\n\nI am just glad I didn't pay full price for this game because I would have been really disappointed to have thrown away $50 at least they only got $12.50 since I got the game for 75% off. Good thing I didn't buy any DLC. So make sure you understand that this game does not natively support Xbox controllers or gamepads there may be some way through trial and error to get a gamepad working but as far as the game actually supporting it like say the way HAWX does you will be disappointed to know there is no such actual support.","December 27, 2013","false","0.8"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","0"

The dog fighting feels spot on and realism CAN be adjusted for more arcade style flying, my only issue is that there is a lack of feedback when you hit other aircraft. The only time that you KNOW that you have scored hits or a kill is a light hint of smoke or the sudden breakup of an arcraft. That's a shame since the damage moddling is actually otherwise really good.\n\nThe full reason for the non recomendation though is how this game feels like a big stinking con. The campaings are lacking  with there only being four structured linear campagins on offer, and one of those is the poor tutorial missions! Then there is the VERY limmited number of aircraft with the packaged game, and DLC aircraft are already IN the game but NOT flyable until you pay a frankly stupid amount of money for the privilage of taking the controls, and a single sinking solo mission per aircraft. Also any DLC bought has to be redeamed through the game NOT automatically added, in the most pain in the ♥♥♥♥ fashon possible (no copy/paste allowed).\n\nWhile the tempation to fly stringbags is strong (it suckered me in), avoid this like genital herpes for it's annoying anti-consumer ideology. Want a decent (but older) flight sim that offers better and fairer bang for £$£$? Check out Il-2 1946 that while much older offers 300+ and lots of campaigns for the price of a pint or two, unlike RoF £15.99 for 4 planes.","January 11, 2014","false","3.9"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","0"

The sensitivity for keyboard control needs serious help (I don't own a joystick).  To fly, you use the simple arrow keys, but there's nothing simple about controlling the plane.  A simple click of an arrow does nothing -- it's like it doesn't register.  So you've got to hold it down.  This, of course, throws the plane into barrel rolls and loops that are agonizingly stupid.  I was hoping for a successor to Red Baron or Knights of the Sky.  THIS ISN'T IT!  If you're up for a Microsoft Flight Simulator type experience, this probably IS what you're looking for, however.","January 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","0"

I will leave the initial "good" portion of my review for what good it may or may not do.\n\nI would suggest anyone thinking of picking up this game do some research and look up some DLC buyers guides that will explain what is actually included in the packs you buy.\n\nIf you are in to the Idea of flying these types of planes this is a very cool flight game, the actions feel really well connected to the planes, the simple act of getting off the ground is a very rewarding feeling, rolling and turning in windy conditions are a real skill tester untill you get the hang of it, also pulling out of a flat stall, successfully limping a disables plane back to base and surviving a crash landing all deliver top notch skill/reward based play. The actual dogfighting/attacking style is very up close and personal, you see each round hit the opponent and it is very rewarding, compared to a modern style hud that shows a radar blip and some audio tones, you actually see the plane your hitting pop smoke and crumble to your fire.\nSo in the end if you are still reading this, my overall impression is that the game is good, if the style of flight seems of any interest to you.","April 25, 2015","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Glad they gave the option to migrate to Steam.\n\nSingle player is available but it is mostly a multiplayer game.\n\nEpic dogfights with aircraft from the WW1 era.\n\nIf you are new to this game. take your time to fine tune the controls and learn to fly the free aircraft properly and set up your joystick buttons and keyboard assignments.\n\nMost important bits: 3 axis joystick. yes you WILL need your rudder with these flying contraptions.\nIf you have more than 1 hardware throttle lever, setup the second lever for mixture, third for radiator etc.\nyou can save the joystick setup per aircraft so don't worry about future multi-engine aircraft.\n\nJoystick buttons: Elevator pitch trim up/down, Fire gunns, reload/unjam guns\n\nKeyboard: I have assigned my head position forward, aft left right with the arrow keys. A huge disadvantage of a bi-plane is that the upper wing is in your view. the ability to quickly move your head is a game changer in a dogfight. Many people use it with TrackIR, I don't because I don't like how it works, maybe I need a bigger monitor for it.\n\nEnjoy the most of this game by setting all the realism settings to hard, and learn that pointing the sharp end of your bullets towards your enemy (how ever difficult that is!) is not nearly the most challenging aspect of a WW1 dogfight.\n\nFor the pilots amongst us, adverse yaw, P-effect, Gyro-effect, dynamic and parasite drag). all of them are modeled in quite a good fasion. Good piloting skills makes a difference!\n\nOnce you master the free aircraft, or if you have a favorite aircraft, spend a few bucks/pounds/moneys on it. it's well worth it but not required to play the game.\n\nHope you enjoy the game! feel free to contact me if you want a chat about this game or aviation in general.\n\n\n","May 29","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
