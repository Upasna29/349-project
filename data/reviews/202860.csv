The campaign scales very well and is both challenging and enjoyable. If your units don't show initiative, it is not the AI's fault, check you unit stats; also upgrade your commander skill for your lead troops. The HUD is intuitive and easy to follow. I highly recommend this game to any strategy-lovers.","January 11, 2014","true","34.9"," 62 of 98 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","62","98","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RodyMetal/recommended/202860/","RodyMetal","Raied","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RodyMetal/","122 products in account","Good game , the battle is just like the previous title which has almost perfect system for historic tactical battles, it refined a bit and feels more fluid especially the camera control. The nice add to this title is the camapign map which is played like Mount & blade system, all in real time, where you can recruit & upgrade your army, and also trade and seige castles, and many other things. There are RPG elements which are good add, you can enhance your hero abilities and thus can be reflected on your army or other aspects of the game, siege battles are fine but could be better. Graphics and overall atmosphere are great for such theme.\nHowever, the campaign map adds a lot as I mentioned previously, but the excution is really poor, the campign map feels so buggy, not realistic at all,for example robbers are like organized kingdom army that can crush you, the trade system feels unreal, the upgrade could be much better, and after sometimes you will feel extreamly bored from campaing and you just want to play those epic historic battles which were in Real Warfare 1242, thats why I would give 6 just because of the campaign, and I think if they make it like Total War game campaing but in real time it will be much better","November 19, 2011","false","5.3"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","28","42","0","0"
