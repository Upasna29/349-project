Nothing more, nothing less.\nSoundtrack is generic elevator music, but it does fit the mood and doesn't get old.\nThere's something about this game that is really satisfying, every time you eat something you get a nice little sound effect and see the grey blob grow a little. These small details add so much to the feel of the game and make it extremely comfortable to play.\nThe price really isn't too bad considering a slightly inferior version of the game is (was?) being sold online for a few bucks more.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game to people who grew up playing flash games online and want to experience the rush of completing level after level again.","March 30","true","2.5"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","49","54","5","3"

I played the original titles of this game and they were great too. With the addition of 1080p (or maybe higher) resolutions and the two player version. This is now a much better title.\n\nIn my opinion, the game is also safe for kids since it doesn't have violence in it. Yeah, you're swallowing cats and mice but it doesn't actually depict any violence, they just go poof.\n\nI'd recommend this title even if it didn't have a discount. It's a simple game and has a simple soundtrack and simple sounds but it's really fun to just absorb everything and get bigger and bigger.\n\nDefinitely worth a try, if you're not sure about buying this game, there are free flash game versions out there that you can try (those aren't as polished as this one, but they have the same mechanic).","March 29","true","1.3"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","24","32","2","0"

But it was pretty fun getting there.\n\nTasty Planet is a simple, silly game where you play as an itty-bitty blob with eyes just as big as your ever-growing stomach.  You roam around varying eras of history eating anything smaller than you, growing a bit whenever you do.  Then you eat things a little bigger, and grow a little bigger, and eat things a little bigger, and grow a little bigger, and....well, you get the idea.\n\nThere are quite a few environments across the many stages, plus additional 'challenge' levels and gold/silver/bronze medals to obtain depending on how quickly you can grow your blob - so there is a decent amount of content and replayability to keep you going.  Additionally, short comic book 'cutscenes' tell the story of your blob as you progress through the game, which is a nice extra tidbit to break from the eat-eat-eat action, and provides a little incentive to keep playing through the story mode.\n\nThe graphics certainly won't astonish you, but are perfectly suitable for the casual action of the game.   The audio is much the same - there isn't a huge amount of variety, but the bouncy beats, gulping sounds, and agonized screams of poor widdle creatures as you finally grow large enough to eat them all fit remarkably well into the simple, mindless gameplay.\n\nThe only real negative to this game is a slightly awkward control scheme; You move your mouse to move the blob, which adds a unique challenge to the game, but can lead to some edge-of-mousepad annoyances.  Unfortunately, there is currently no gamepad support to make this easier.\n\nAll in all, everything about Tasty Plane fits perfectly into it's niche - a casual way to blow some time with uncomplicated, mindless fun.  It may not be an intricate genre-defining game that will be remembered through the ages, but it definitely succeeds as a simple game with plenty of levels and extra challenges for (re)playability, providing quite a bit of fun for a rather small investment.\n\nI give this game a solid... Yum/10! (Sorry, had to do it.  The game itself is better than that joke though, really!)\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

You control the Grey Goo world absorber who likes nothing more than eating all in sight.  I loved being the Grey Goo starting out eating what looks like “Smarties” and then stepping up to glass tubes, batteries, mice and cats.  Then before you know it you’re eating a time machine and travelling to more tasty worlds.  I never imagined having the opportunity to travel to the world of the dinosaur let alone chomping down on a T-Rex.  This is a quick paced fun little game of eat everything is sight so long as you’re bigger than it.  I loved the way the graphics expanded to reveal the larger world and new larger meals that awaited,  This is a game for the time constrained, those in need of a small pick me up and those who love to over run a buffet and eat every thing in sight. It’s easy to learn and tough to master as the further you delve into the game the harder the challenges become. Everything works as intended and the game has been Steamified with achievements and trading cards for the collectors.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable game that is easily recommendable.\n\nVisit Steamified[www.steamified.com] for more reviews and our epic giveaways","April 7","true","18.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

However, the game looks good, sounds nice and is enjoyable. Some levels are set up like mazes or have predators that reduce your size when you don't avoid them. Each level has bronze/silver/gold time rating but lets you move forward regardless of your time which is perfect for younger kids. I plan to try out the co-op next time my nephews stop by.   The $6 price tag could be considered steep and yet without a shop that requires pay to progress tactics like many of this genre it is a more like a one-time fee to play without built in road blocks.\n\nPerfect for those with kids, quick/short gaming breaks and while you watch a movie.

This game pretty much takes the katamari idea of a small object collecting bigger objects, and takes it into an overhead view. This game is fun. I have a few gripes about it, but nothing worthwhile for the price you pay.\nNegatives:\n\nThe game can feel a bit to fast at times. I've played with controller, keyboard, and mouse. All three controls at times feel like the ball of goo is moving faster than your input. Especiallly when zoomed out far.\n\nThe soundtrack is fun, but it can be a bit samey after a while. This isn't to terrible. It's nice the first few rounds, after hearing the songs enough though, you may end up turning the volume down and playing your own music while eagarly devouring everything.\n\nSome levels are just collections of previous levels. I like teh idea of being able to tackle everything at once, but when you go through 4 or 5 sections of a level seperately, than the next required level is to just go through all of those sections together, it feels a bit bland.\n\nPositives:\n\nThe levels have a pretty nice variety aside from the note mentioned above.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simplistic to pick up and fairly easy to understand. It helps you out if you have not played a game like this by pointing you in the direction of the smallest thing near you.\n\nThere is multiplayer which can be implemented on all levels. Although you may not go in all directions splitting to far away from your partner, it's still great that it is implemented in the game.","March 30","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lefiath/recommended/445110/","lefiath","lefiath | CZ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lefiath/","583 products in account","Note: This is a mixed review, I'm explaining below, but I've decided to give thumb down rather than thumb up. Steam didn't properly count that I've played most of the game in offline mode, I should have over 6 hours of gameplay.\n\nIt was a pleasant surprise to find out that a game which I've remember playing such a long time ago (and one of the few digital games I've ever purchased) is now on steam. However, there was more than one Tasty Planet game and sadly, this isn't the best one in my opinion.\n\nGameplayAs you can tell, you control a blob which consumes anything of a smaller size which helps it grow to eat bigger things, until it consumes the whole universe. The game is a decent casual fun, it's relaxing, all you need is your right hand (I'm not going there) and you're set, but if you want a challenge, going for gold medals or playing the bonus levels is a way to go too. Eating things is fairly enjoyable when levels are nicely composed, and it's always satisfying to get a revenge on a previously larger predators that were threatening you.\n\nSome of the levels are nicely paced and varied, but ultimately, most of the are the same, and the game can get stale really quickly. There just isn't enough varienty in terms of levels, sometimes you encounter something more than just level where you continuously eat things around you to get bigger, something that requires a little bit more effort, but those levels are few and far between. Which is where we're getting straight into a value, because everything else regarding presentation is sufficient enough.\n\nValueDespite having a decent time with it, I can't wholeheartedly recommend it - the problem lies within the fact that this game is a remake/sequel of original Tasty Planet, and not a very good one at that. I'm not recommending it simply because there is a better game that has not been ported to steam.\n\nWhile my memory is a little hazy, since it has been years, original utilized the plot better into each level - the "story" isn't really important, the original did much better job putting you on a journey to eat the whole planet, while in Back for Seconds you often feel like you're just jumping around doing random stuff like eating cats and dogs. I also don't rememeber too much copy-pasted levels from original, which this game often does - after each episode, it has a tendency to throw all the levels you just went through into one final, which usually doesn't offer anything else other than let's say 5 levels placed into one gigantic level. Last level of this game is everything you've encountered from the very beginning until the end, and the level lasts over 20 minutes, while regular time of a single level is usually around 5 minutes. It's actually fairly annoying for a last level.\n\nThere are plenty of bonus levels, but they feel even cheaper and sub par to some of the more uninspired ones from the campaign, and they've obviously not placed into any kind of theme, just random stuff that's without a doubt more challenging, but that's not really what I'm looking for in a casual game.\n\nBack to the original. It looked better - it had more hand-drawn look to it, which this one doesn't, and some of the things/enemies look downright appaling, or lazy. As for the pacing and gameplay value, the original had more shorter levels with far more varienty, and also one thing that helped out with a challenge a bit more, you could die from one hit from some of the enemies. Here, when levels can sometimes take 10 minutes, it's obviously not possible, the variety is questionable (there is one level where for most of the time you eat red stars, that's it, they don't even change colors).\n\nConclusionIn the end, you have a game that looks OK, the music is kind-of elevator music kind, which is fine (and I think all the tracks are taken from the original game), level varienty is lacking, they get repetitive and sometimes literally get repeated, and they aren't that many. And unlike the first game, the only challenge here is to get medals - if you play the game, you can't really lose, unless you will purposely try. You will never repeat a level because you've failed and you want to overcome the challenge it poses, that will only come to play if you're trying to beat it in a certain time - that's it, there are no levels that would be even remotely challenging on their own.\n\nSo I'm not recommending this game not because it's bad, but because it's not as good as the other one.

Not recommended for ANY price.\n\nThe longer version:\n\nOkay, I liked Spore. I liked the ConSumo minigame in Bully. A game where you have to gather 'food' in order to 'grow' to advance can be fun, especially if there's some skill needed and you have additional benefits/hazards on advancing like evolving and encountering harder enemies.\n\nAnd then there is Tasty Planet. Yes, the devs have taken the time to fit a comic-book style of storytelling inbetween levels, one mark in their favor, but that does not make a game. Let alone a good one. Essentially, every level has your blob of grey goo (nanomachine colony) either following the mouse, or going to a clicked-on spot. Anything smaller than you is absorbed (randomly accompanied by 'yum'-sounds and the like, eerily reminiscent of the old recorded voice-works in fairytale themepark De Efteling. Anything larger might be harmful to you. The more you absorb, the larger the objects you can consume.\n\nSounds fun? Trust me, it isn't. Every level your size is reset randomly. Grow to over a meter? Reset to a milimeter. Resources are scattered randomly and the locator arrow is mostly useless, making it nigh impossible to meet the time-limits for the bronze, silver and golden medals. Not that it matters, you just have to absorb enough things to fill the growthgauge in order to unlock the next level. By all means, look at my playtime. I've played through a third of all standard levels in that and was bored to tears by then.\n\nNot even the resources make up for it. Let's face it, aside from the M&M's clones the sheer volume of them is implausible and variety is simply lacking. Yes, each set of levels has a theme of sorts: labs, dino's, egypt... blah blah blah. Thing is, you have to gulp down a ton of stuff too small for you on average before you can absorb something your size or marginally larger. Perspective jumps are also quite random. The worst though is that the devs did not bother with much historical or paleontological accuracy, nor with creativity in displaying actual differences between consumables.\n\nSo, is this game worth €5,99? Ahaha, NOPE. This time-waster doesn't register as a game with me, nor should it with you. Get a proper game and send this unabashed piece of garbage back to NewGrounds.","April 4","false","0.5"," 3 of 18 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","3","18","2","2"

For the price, it's not bad. I got a couple hours of fun out of it... well... more like about an hour to an hour and a half of fun, and then impatiently going through the levels to see how the ending is, hoping it'd be what I wanted in the first place. To go from microscopic to astronomical. That's what I wanted at the beginning, but I had to go through ALL those levels to get it. Yeah it was genuinely fun at the start, found it funny that the cats had individual names, the small amount of dialogue is funny at times, the music is charming, and it was kind of fun learning about the different historical items. Now I know that the Wakizashi is between the Tanto and Katana. In the end however, it felt stretched out, the monotonous gameplay stretched on for quite some time, and it felt like the little jokes were getting fewer and farther between.\n\nThe end did pay off a bit, but I'd have preferred it if I didn't have to go through all those levels just to get the final level, which is what I was looking forward to in the first place. It's only been 2 or 3 hours worth of gameplay, but I'm so tired of its monotony that I finished about 3 of the bonus levels, and I have NOOOO interest whatsoever in grinding my way to getting more medals just to play more. If you've got a few dollars, pounds, Euros, yen, or what have you lying around, and you enjoy games like the fish one where you go from really small to really big by eating other creatures/objects, then this one will sate you for a while. I think it could afford to be a little cheaper, but it's still less than $10 Canadian so I won't complain. I have no regret in having bought it, but I don't see the replay value, and thus the vast majority of the bonus levels will forever remain unplayed because I REALLY don't want to play the main storyline more than once.\n\nWell, that's that. I did find that one bonus level with the drawings made in candy to be quite nice. In the credits, just about all of them have the same last name, so it seems to be a family enterprise. Oh yeah, and I couldn't help but notice the Mounties which look quite Canadian, then there's maple leaves in many of the levels. With a name like Dingo Games, you'd think they'd be Aussie... ah, I just looked it up. They're from Vancouver, British Columbia, which is of course in Canada. That explains it. Very cool, didn't know I was playing a Canadian made game. If it were $10 or more, I'd probably call it a rip off, I think $5 Canadian dollars is more this game's speed rather than $8, but 3 bucks isn't exactly something worth getting in a tiff over. Before, I didn't regret buying the game, but now, I think I'm actually glad I did; supports a Canadian game developer. Keep at it, eh!","April 19","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An extremely simple, yet entertaining mechanic as you guide your little goo blob through different eras.\nGreat timewaster and even pretty challenging if you're going for those medal times.","June 4","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
