"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nekrage/recommended/290140/","Nekrage","[OT]Nekrage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nekrage/","733 products in account","Note: My play time on Steam is NOT what I determined this review with. I played before it came to Steam.\n\n\nFirst off my guild(The Oran'Thul) was personally contacted by the devs of Echo of Soul to test the game. This is an unbiased, truthful review of the game.\n\n\n\nLet me start by saying I plan to give this game a negative review. Now that's not saying its terrible and its not worth playing, but for those who take their MMOs seriously and competitively, you are going to want to steer clear of this one.\n\n\nEcho of Soul at its core is a pretty decent MMO, entertaining pve and pvp. It does not stand out from the rest of the MMO's but for the features it does have, it does do them pretty well.\n\nThe MAJOR issues that this game suffers from is pretty much what plagues every other MMO that has been released for the past few years.\n\n1. PAY TO WIN.\n\nThis is a MAJOR issue for those who wish to play MMOs competitively and take their MMOs seriously. This game comes from Aeria games, for those of you who have played their games before you most likely are not surprised to hear that this game is P2W.\n\n2. BALANCE ISSUES.\n\nMy god.....my guild and I looked past the pay to win issue in this game and said "meh its an MMO to kill time with". When we got into the battlegrounds....  the balance...MY GOD THE BALANCE!!!!\n\nThe issue became apparent when we were sitll low levels, so we brushed it off as a balance issue at lower level pvp. As we leveled the issue became much...MUCH worse.\n\nThere are currently 5 classes in the game, 3 are nearly unplayable vs the other 2. Can you guess who the underpowered ones are? As always, its the melee. The sorceress and the Archer are disgustingly overpowered to the point that you shouldn't even bother pvping at all as a melee.\n\n3. CHANNEL SYSTEM\n\nThe channel system...the bane on all open world MMOs. For those of you who dont know what a channel system is....here is a quick explanation.\n\nA channel system is pretty much a way to take one server and break it up into a ton of mini servers. This allows the developers to spread out a congested world so players arent overcrowding everything to the point that there are no mobs to kill and you cant move an inch without being ganked.\n\nThere is a right way, and a wrong way to implement a system like this. Echo of Soul does it the wrong way.\n\nAs you progress through the game you are constantly entering little instance portals, this hurts the game as you get the feeling that the world is not an open worlds, its just a bunch of mini instances smashed together with load screens between each of them.\n\nWhen you enter these portals you are thrown into a random channel of that specific zone.\n\nFor instance...\n\nFOREST ZONE (CHANNEL 2) --> CAVE ZONE (CHANNEL 4)\n\nAs you can see above, when you progress from one zone to another you are thrown into a random channel. This may be packed full of players, or have none at all.\n\nThis really destroys the feeling of being in an open, growing world filled with players.\n\nIn addition this absolutely KILLS world pvp. My guild and I found it nearly impossible to join a friend in a channel to participate in world pvp becuase the channel was filled.\n\nLastely this also allows players to leave the channel to run away from potential pvp.\n\nThis truly makes for a babies MMO and anyone serious about their MMOs should stay away.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nSome cash shop items.\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstant ressing on spot.\n\n4% attack damage buff\n4% defense buff\n30% increased pvp currency\nmounts that have a lower chance to be knocked off of when received damage.\namnesia = respec (you only get ONE for free....ONE)\n\nEXP AND GOLD GAIN DOUBLED FOR 24 HOURS.\n\nDigestant = Allows you to use an incredible amount of rediculously powerful food buffs.\n\nAppraisers Pouch = Reroll stats on a piece of gear to obtain the one that suits you best.\n\nAND THE WORST MOST PAY TO WIN CRAP IN THE GAME\n\nSAFEGUARD = PREVENTS A JEWEL FROM BEING DESTROYED WHEN ENHANCEMENT FAILS. - This right here.\n\nAnd in Addition...\nENHANCEMENT BOOSTER = INCREASE THE CHANCE FOR A SUCCESFULL ENHANCEMENT.\n\nJewels are single BEST way to increase your gear. You know those MMOs where you can increase a piece of gear from +1 to +5 without failing then anything from +6 to +9 has a chance to downgrade then anything above +9 has a chance to break the piece of gear?\n\nWell these jewels are that in a nutshell. A player with +10 gems in every slot can easily kill 5 players at the same time if those players have no gems.\n\nIf you continue to use this item and shovel heaps and heaps of money into the cash shop. YOU. WILL. BECOME. A. GOD.\n\nIt may take you $1000, or maybe $2000, but if you throw enough money at this game YOU WILL BE UNTOUCHABLE.\n\nHere, enjoy some links.\n\nhttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/92659e831f6a71673aaff2e483503276/files/eos/image/F/FarmpackEN.jpg\n\nhttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/c4d3f6851764005cc00e8f558f711bb6/files/eos/image/2/2-Safe-23.jpg\n\nhttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/388506da8cdc0bf28698113eee760cb3/files/eos/image/1/10-EN1-230.jpg\n\nhttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/3a9742e1df1c8bcfe89e4e9225c2cc76/files/eos/image/p/pvppackhero.jpg\n\nhttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/5e5fe0eed44ce71da5e09675f95a3355/files/eos/image/4/401-AppraisersPouch50WM.jpg\n\nhttp://cms-content.s.aeriastatic.com/d4924c57c4fcc6da8c3fb528e42e4b7a/files/eos/image/1/101-Amnesia.jpg\n\nSource: Their cash shop page: http://echoofsoul.aeriagames.com/itemmall/Featured\n\n\nAll in all, its not too bad for casual MMO players.\n\nI give it a MEH out of a possible BON QUISLO","June 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 1,209 of 1,489 people (81%) found this review helpful 121 people found this review funny","81","209","1","121","55"

If you play other mmo's ou'll find the quests are of the usual variety collect X of this, kill Y of those monsters, one feature i do like and wish a few others would pick up and incorperate into thier games is that not only do the quests show on the mini map each quest has a little arrow and distance marker beside it showing where to go and how far it is, nice touch thanks, quest text is clear and easily readable and understandable and also conveys the game lore without it being bashed over your head with it.\nThe single player dungeons are also a nice touch aswell, it gives you  the chance run off do a dungeon without having to hang around either waiting for a group finder to get a group for you or you tring to PUG a group, the instances are not insainely difficault and can be done with quest dropped items and also give good rewards without spending ages to finish   there are some simple tactics to each boss which are easy to pick up and learn, and the usual rule applies "Dont stand in the Fire".\nTo the big question being as it is free to play is it pay to win?   As far as PVE goes not really, you can get boosts and safegaurds to your crafting and things of that fayre but most of the pay for items I've seen so far are vanaty Items and these can be perchased in game from merchants with gold and silver anyway.\n\nConclusion...\nWould i recommend this game to other people? Yes, it makes an ideal starter MMo for people comming into the genre its not overly complicated and everything is explained for you, its not as "grindy" as some i could mention and has a nice pace to it. It does not have the cutting edge graphics that some of the latest MMo's have so can be played on an average  PC or Laptop which is no bad thing, not everyone can afford a top end gaming rig. For an experienced MMo player like myself i found it a nice change, everone one i've spoken to in game has been friendly and helpfull which is nice and bodes well for the in game community as a whole. While this will never replace my main MMo's its also not going to be left out either.","June 27, 2015","true","44.4"," 179 of 218 people (82%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","82","179","218","11","0"

Creating a character is a little bit weird since you have  gender locked  classes.\nBeside that: The options to customize your character are really nice! I'm very happy with the way my char looks!\n\n2. Graphics: The game will not deliver the best graphics in history but its decent for a f2p. Not everybody can afford to have a BiS computer. It can reach a wider audience and attracts more players.\n\n3. First Steps: The game basically supports you in every possible way.  Quests to introduce the dungeon browser, pvp browser and so on.\n\n4. Questing: Of course its the usual Search X and deliver it to Y, Kill X amount of Y but there are other quests as well. I'm not positively surprised but also not disappointed.\n\n5. PvP: You can clearly feel, that the game is made for Characters who reached level 60. You can join the pvp battle as soon as you hit level 10 (with an outstanding matchmaking system) and you most likely get owned by people who have a higher level than you. You resistance and HP are pumped up to level 60 standard but you can obviously not compete with your level 10 gear and skillset. Nevertheless, I was able to get the mvp (best player in the team) a lot of times when i was between level 10 and 40. The PvP is not necessarily innovative but it gives a ton of xp, and is really fun. Even though you are a melee and not level 60.\n\nI also dont get why people complain about (always the same). They took the best content of other games and implemented it here. Its a nice combination of my favourite MMOS.\n\n6. PvE: I really really like the Single Dungeon System and the grouping is amazing as well. You can match groups or go alone. One criticism: The leader can just kick people for whatever reason. If you dont have the super awesome gear, you get kicked in most of the times. On the other hand: It helps a lot to not wipe infinitely and if you dont have good gear, get some. There are tons of ways to farm good stuff in the game and i dont speak about cashing in.\n\n7. p2w?: Yes and No! Of course, this is a f2p title and some paid features give you some kind of advantage. I think, Aeria wants to make things different here and when I compare this Launch to Aura Kingdom back in the days, I can clearly say, that this here is totally different.\n\nI never had the feeling that I have to spend money. Questing was always flawless, never an artificial blocker which annoyed me or forced me to buy an xp boost. There are tons of free events which give me some nice goodies.\n\nIm pretty okay with the fact that people who spend money get some benefits since they are keeping the service alive!\n\nSummary:\n\nThere are pros and cons but eventually the game is a lot of fun to play, even without paying!\n\nThe game is not really "free". Paying users get some benefits but they dont have an impact on the fairness in game. You can achieve everything without paying in a reasonable time. Its just like a p2p mmo but paying users get a small advantage. Pretty fair imo.","June 23, 2015","true","38.1"," 155 of 210 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","155","210","7","0"

Emerald? Goes in belt slot and so on.\n-Log in bonus, gives some interesting stuff. XP buff for 7 days, other varies things from the cash shop/found in-game.\n-End of the first 7 days logging in every day get a faster then "generic" mount. Means EVERYONE gets it, not who spent cash.\n-Classes are pretty basic with "talents and a path" to chose from.\n-Not overly complex coming from class/talent choices. Makes for easier understanding.\n-Every class gets a dodge/teleport out of AOE/trouble usuable on a short cooldown.\n-You can be farely close to a mob without aggroing it, making it easy to travel from location to location\n-Emotes are unique with some thought placed into their animations\n-If you get a quest you need to kill 4 monkeys, you kill the first monkey and the marker will move to the next "Monkey" so you're not easily lost questing\n-In big quest hub/major city there is a quest guy who will send you to your next questing location via a map teleport, if you're ever lost.\n-PVP is kind of fun, normally not my kind of thing but for a game with no healers, it makes for a stand your ground type thing.\n\n\nDislike\n-Profession system isn't clearly explained\n-Gender Locking\n-The Voice Acting, what little there was.\n-Some of the story feels a bit scattered, all over the place\n-The Cash Shop doesn't really have a whole lot in it, no dangly carrot to make me WANT to spend money...just two quests kind of introducing the Cash Shop (If you're interested in doing them, you need to drop cash or you can easily ignore the two quests)\n-It can be poorly optimized in areas\n-Graphics are pretty but lacking in feeling\n-Quest text can easily be ignored by pressing F (The function with everything in-game Key) and opening the map to find the number you need/are working on.\n-The "eating/food" buff has NO explanation, it's kind of a stumbled upon fact.\n-PVP maps not explained, just dumped in.\n-Incredibly tiny player base.\n\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this as a fun little game. I am not a big supporter on the publisher they chose to go with, but the game is fun. It's got some seriously good potential if the developers take the time and put some serious polish on it. I can't say it's better then anything, the game is very generic and lacks the oomph needed to get it out there with other major MMORPG contenders, but for a niche random choice, it's decent.","August 31, 2015","true","71.1"," 86 of 106 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","86","106","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lanoren/recommended/290140/","Lanoren","Lanoren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lanoren/","","How to begin with Echo of Soul...\n\nI suppose to begin, I'm gong to give my rating on this game:  8/10 (reserving judgment due to the status of the game being Open Beta) => RECOMMENDED\n\nI've had a bit of a love-hate relationship with Aeria Games since I first became a member in 2008.  Echo of Soul is the third of their published games which I've played for more than 2 days.  In fact, I've been playing this game since their Open Beta launch on June 1st.  But this isn't about my history with others of Aeria's games, this review is about this one in particular.  Let's begin, shall we?\n\n=====CHARACTER CREATION=====\nThe first thing you'll notice about Echo of Soul is that there are a total of five classes (thus far) to choose from.  These classes are gender-locked, and each class has two spec mastery paths.  The gender lock is there to follow with the game's storyline.  The classes you can choose from are as follows:\n\n1.  Male Warrior\n2.  Male Rogue\n3.  Female Guardian (Lancer, for those familiar with Tera)\n4.  Female Mage\n5.  Female Archer\n\nAs you will begin to notice, there is no dedicated healing class.  More on this later.\n\nEach class has different customization options available to further make your character unique in physical appearance.  You then start off with a default costume (I can assume this to be random from a small pool, as I've created different characters of the same class, and ended up with differing clothing looks from the get-go.)\n\n=====LEVELING=====\nLeveling in Echo of Soul is very much geared toward the casual player.  For the hardcore speedlevelers, it's possible to make it from levels 1 to 60 (current cap, at time of review) in a matter of 1-3 days through the game's PvP Battlegrounds (accessible starting at level 10.)  For the more casual player, you can still make it to 60 relatively quickly or you can take your time with it.  Moderate-speed casual players can make it inside of a week.  Slow casuals can make it to cap in abotu 2 weeks of gameplay time.\n\nBoth PvP and PvE Questing offer a very generous amount of EXP, so reaching cap is entirely on how you want to do it.  You can go solely as a Battlegrounds resident, through the PvE story, or mix it up a bit.  For the best leveling experience, I would recommend doing either PvP or PvE (depending on which one you want to stick to primarily) just to try it out.\n\nGrinding mobs in the overworld will provide very little in the way of EXP.  Grinding overworld mobs is an easy option to obtain enhancement jewels, crafting ingredients, or even some crafting recipes.  If you wish to do PvE grind for EXP, then your best bet would be to do so in the dungeons.  Though, grinding out the dungeons might not be a bad idea, as the sub and main bosses can provide your character with class-specific equipment sets to further enhance your stats and abilities.  There is also the option to take repeatables in maps called Infinite Hunting Grounds which also reward a fair amount of EXP per turn-in.\n\n=====ECONOMY=====\nThere are a couple of things which new players will find out relatively quickly:\n1.  Mobs do not drop money.\n2.  Items from NPC vendors are really cheap.\n\nThis means it will be relatively difficult to make solid gold before your 50-60 level bracket.  I would assume it to be a tactic by the developers to maintain a relatively strong pre-endgame economy.  With that being said, there is no restrictions on the amount of in-game gold you can carry in difference to those at level cap.  If you wish to make some quick major gold for your earlier levels, your best bet would be to utilize the cash shop and in-game auction board.\n\nAs I have not hit level cap, as of yet (I'm a -very- slow player, and have taken more time to get to know the forum community due to my work/sleep schedules) I will not post a comment on endgame economy.\n\n=====QUESTING=====\nPvE questing is quite linear, and very story-based.  While you do get a vast amount of miscellaneous quests (both overworld and dungeon) the magic of PvE questing truly shines with the story-based quests.  As with most typical MMORPGs, you get EXP, money, and the occasional piece of gear to upgrade your set.  However, it's also relatively easy to outlevel some of these quests, but the EXP you gain from some of the lower-level quests is still quite generous.\n\n=====Player-versus-Player=====\nEcho of Soul offers two types of PvP:  Battlegrounds and Open-World Guild vs Guild.  Let's expand, shall we?\n\nCurrently, there are two Battlegrounds maps (both accessible starting at level 10.)  Both are points-based Capture the Flag-esque types.  One requires teams to capture resources spawned on the map, and the other requires teams to capture and hold towers for as long as possible.  The actual player-kill aspect of these battlegrounds can be quite hectic and fast-paced.  There are also two tiers of Battlegrounds- one for Levels 10-59, and one exclusively for Level 60.\n\nOpen-World GvG takes place between guilds which have declared themselves to be hostile.  Players in hostile guilds are fair game to be PK'd at any time, anywhere by other hostile guilds' members.  Guildless and Peaceful-alligned guild players do not have to worry about being randomly PK'd while running around the overworld maps.\n\nThere is also a PvP event (run at least daily) called Valhalla.  Since I have yet to participate in this event, I cannot write a review about it.\n\n=====CRAFTING=====\nLike the rest of the game, crafting is geared toward the more casual player.  Relatively cheap and brainless, it's fairly easy to level both a profession and the two hobby crafting skills available in a short amount of time.  Certain tiers of crafting require certain character levels to be obtained.  Beginner-level crafters can gain most of their supplies directly from their crafting vendor.  However, there does come a time where some mob grinding is required to get higher level base materials.\n\n=====UNIQUE FEATURES=====\n1.  Echo of Soul has a hunger system.  This is determined by two values:  Energy and Satiety.  The higher your current energy level is to your max, certain buffs are applied to your character.  You increase energy by eating foods which are crafted or obtained as quest rewards.  Satiety is how much food you can eat.  With a max value of 1,000 and each piece of food taking up 200 Satiety, this leaves you with a maximum of 5 food waten at a time.  Satiety can be decreased over time, or with the use of a Digestant item.  Energy is depleted through the use of skills.\n\n2.  The Soul System:  Through daily rewards or killing of mobs, you can obtain what's called "Chaos Souls."  When purified (either near a purification point, or cooperatively with another player) these souls can grant you charges for temporary buffs.\n\n3.  The Cash Shop:  While most free-to-play MMOs out there have a cash shop which is mostly geared to be pay-to-win, Echo of Souls isn't geared that way.  Mostly asthetics or RNG fun, there is literally nothing on the cash shop which you are required to get to advance in the game, or gain a significant advantage.  The things on the shop which seem that way are literally a pay-to-be-lazy mechanic.\n\n4.  No Dedicated Healer Class:  The entire party works as a team to heal!\n\n=====THE BADS=====\n1.  There is no general server chat channel.  Primary communication is done at either close-range, through the use of the Loudspeaker items, or on the map-specific Shout channel.  Unless you get yourself into an active guild, or are part of a different chat system (i.e. Teamspeak) prepare to be playing mostly in blisful chat silence towards you.\n\n2.  Your other Typicals:  Elitists, gold spammers, and general complaining doomsday naysayers.\n\n=====TL;DR=====\nIf you're a casual gamer looking for a casual game which you can level relatively easily without getting too far behind the curve, then Echo of Soul is a good pick for you!","June 23, 2015","true","187.6"," 69 of 97 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","69","97","7","4"

There are tanks (Protector and Earthguard), DDs ( Rogue, Mage, Hunter, Berseker and Stormguard) and Supporter (Bard). Yes there is no healer, which gives you the control of your own healthbar.\n\nProfessions: Haven't looked in to it too much till now but there are primary (resource gathering, alchemy, juwelery) and secondary (soul something and cooking) professions)\n\nControl: You use your mouse to target things and move your camera. Your keyboard is for interacting with npcs and using skills. So nothing out of the odinary.\n\nLeveling: Leveling is quite easy. You can quick select quests with f, you have a build in questhelper and the first 20-30 Lvls are easily done. The longer you are in the game, the more you must be casious about your skills and need to find a good rotation to progress quickly.\n\nCombat: It's a rotation and static based combat system. You cant move while attacking/casting. That being said, the Fights with bosses relies on heavy movement mechanics, which makes things really difficult sometimes. I like that system, it leaves it to you to optimize your dmg output.\n\nPvP: 2 PVP maps, 5v5 Arena and Guildbattles at the start of a F2P game? Check! that's actually pretty big and well done.\n\nDungeons: You have lots of solo dungeons (every 10 lvls 1) which gives you the opportunity to equip yourself and have some fun thorugh the leveling process. There are group dungeons too, but mostly for lvl 60 chars.\n\nEndgame: This Game has it all: good balanced pvp (no dimishing return right now, i hope they patch that in), lots of dungeon content, tiered equip, lots of dailys and professions to do. It won't get boring!\n\nDifficulty: I would say you can compare it easily to Vanilla wow, which was for me the most challenging mmo experience I had so far. Most bosses punishing mistakes quite heavily and you won't get much help through guides because there aren't many out yet. You need to learn everything for yourself and that in an environment which is not forgiving to mistakes. For me it's pretty fun :)\n\nNew things? when you are ahead in lvl, you can warp yourself to a higher map without the need to walk.\n\nBad things? For not so talented MMO player its pretty hard, very difficult to equip yourself without help in the first tiers. You can be held in Stunlock in PVP forever. Your bags are to small. All the cool looking stuff cost (normal armor looks a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥)\n\nOverall: I would recommend trying it out. When you get past the early 2-3 hours (pls don't hear on reviews from people with such short duration of play. They have no experience and just hate for no reason). It isn't for everyone, but it's F2P so trying it out would be the best choice for you.\n\n\n","July 20, 2015","true","193.3"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","34","45","6","0"

It's not a bad game but it's nothing but "go kill 3-5 of those monsters"and "go collect 3-5 of this plant" back-to-back non-stop. The game makes you think you're not grinding monsters like crazy by giving you low quantity kill/collect requirements per quest. But once I got an achievement for completing a 100 quests I realized I've been doing nothing but killing and collecting stuff. >_>\nThere was never any need to party up with someone. Party quests were easily soloed and I noticed the LFG system said here was ONLY 1! party dungeon at level 35 and the rest were all level 60. So much for multiplayer..\n\nEDIT:\nSo I managed to grind through to 60. God save my soul! The endgame is pretty much a continuation of the leveling process. Daily quests that have you kill 100 mobs just to get some healing potions (which cost a ton if you just buy them at the merchant). You can only do a party dungeon 4 times per week! And you get a lock out if your party leaves at the start of the dungeon if they see your gears sucks. I did the completed the first lvl 60 dungeon only ONCE!

It's one thing to say this game is bad, but it's not that great either.\n\nFor the most part, Echo of Soul plays out like your average tab-target MMO where you go around questing, leveling, etc. What separates this game from its other competitors is its focus on its endgame content, which happens at level 60. The entry barrier for getting to 60 is pretty low and you'll find the path to leveling is pretty simple. However, the moment you hit 60, you'll feel like you're starting at level 1 again. You have to grind your way up the gear ladder just to be able to run party dungeons efficiently, and PVP is not exactly a good option entering level 60 due to a number of powerful players.\n\nThis is all due to the game's inherent jewel system. The idea of jewels was pretty neat when you're introduced to it around level 15. These jewels enhance your stats and can be combined to form stronger jewels, which can be inserted into sockets on your equipment. While the jewels had a chance to break after a certain point, the game gave you a decent amount of jewels as you leveled, so there was always a steady form of progression in the form of jewels and gear. However, this was all thrown out the window and slows to a halt at level 60, mainly due to the game's separation of jewels into two tiers: dull (used from levels 1-59) and lucid (used at level 60). A fresh player will enter level 60 feeling much weaker than before, as the enemies' power suddenly spikes up as you're forced to trudge through this initial stage of endgame and progression slows down considerably.\n\nThe biggest problem here is time. As you play, you WILL get everything you need, but that depends on how much time you're willing to invest. Without friends or a nice guild helping you out, you're pretty much stuck grinding some boring dungeons until you can get more these lucid jewels for upgrading your character. The cash shop has a few time-savers that more serious players would consider investing into, from safeguards to prevent jewels from breaking when upgrading and pets that can loot items for you. I do recommend trying to play without spending on these premium items, as they're pretty unnecessary if you can play smart and try to be as self-sufficient as possible.\n\nOther than my personal gripe with lucid jewels and the beginning of level 60, the PVE gameplay is pretty good. Questing from 1-59 was a breeze for me and once I managed to gather up some gear at level 60, the party dungeons have been fun to run through thanks to the dungeon mechanics keeping players in check. PVP from 1-59 can be pretty fun and has normalized stats to keep it in check, but I suggest staying away from level 60 PVP unless you manage to gather a lot of lucid jewels.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent F2P MMO like WoW, EoS might be a good game to check out, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.","November 28, 2015","false","246.9"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","0"

You know what my favourite kind of hamburger is? The one without any kind of meat, or lettuce, or sauce, JUST bread. Yummy.\n\nNot to mention you can make three kinds of burgers (BBQ, Bacon ...) and they all need only one ingredient - bread.\n\nAs a person who loves crafting this is bad. You know what else is bad? Get this:\n\nThere are three professions in this game, of which you can only learn one, and two hobbies of which you can learn both.\n\nTwo of the professions need resources you can gather in the wild. Guess what the third profession is. Yep, its Resource gathering.\n\nSo either you become a resource gatherer and can make nothing out of it but sell things, or you become an alchemist or jeweler and can make nothing because you can't gather resources. If they want to create an active, living market, this is NOT the way to do it, and it somewhat cancels out a certain type of freedom, too, if you want to gather and make your own stuff out of it.\n\nHowever, after playing a bit I have to say that, otherwise, the game is quite solid. The fighting is fun, the graphics are slightly above average but are used well, the game feels fluid despite using the good old tab targeting fighting system, and it constantly rewards you and keeps you engaged. It is still somewhat generic, but I rate games based on how fun they are, and...well, I am having fun.\n\nHow long that will motivate me? I don't know, but for now, I am motivated to play until the first dungeon (apparently Lvl. 35) and, for an MMO these days, that says a lot for me. Will update this as I go along.\n\nEdit 1, 23th June 2015: PVP seems pretty well done. I have seen people saying that melee has an extreme disadvantage, but after playing a few matches, I have seen none of that. Of course, I am nowhere near experienced to really say for certain but it seems pretty fair to me for both melee and ranged, and PVP is kinda fun.\n\nEdit 2, 29th June 2015: I played the game more, and rolled a new character. They all feel distinctively different which is certainly a good thing. I still recommend this game.\n\nEdit 3, 07th July 2015: I think my final verdict on it is that it is certainly a good and fun way to pass time if you don't look for anything deep. Everyone else should stay away, because its very same-y.","June 23, 2015","true","11.7"," 47 of 72 people (65%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","65","47","72","21","0"

It's really fun and the graphics are really pretty! There are a couple cons for this game, though. But I'll make a little list!\n\nCon:\n1. Only five classes to choose from, cannot choose your gender for them. 2 male classes and 3 female\n2. It's like every other MMO, kill and collect\n3. Not a lot of armor choices when buying them in the game stores (most other armor is given through different quests)\n4. Chat is broken, it censors words that arn't even bad. (Ex: I was censored when writing "something" and character names that have a small resemblence to swear words (such as "Shizuo" from Durarara))\n\nOther than those few things, I really enjoyed this game! Don't let the cons that I listed stop you from playing. The game is beautiful style-wise and theres quite a bit of customization you can do with your character! Most MMOs just give you four choices of colors for you hair or something like that, but this game has so much more! The community of the game is pretty nice and I haven't had many problems with the other players. I haven't had to level grind at all because the quest lines pretty much go with your current level. If an enemy overpowers you, usually its just because you need to upgrade your armor or repair it. The quests arn't overly time consuming. I never had a quest that made me kill over 10 enemies (most of them are around 3-5 enemies). There is quite a bit to this game and I really enjoy it! I do reccomend that you try it out.

I have played MMO's since before WoW was an idea. I may throw some more time into this game, but I highly doubt it.\n\nFirst off, all classes are genderlocked. So no, you can not choose your gender. Honestly, not a big issue with me as I'm more about the gameplay and content. It was just a drawback from the standpoint I love customization and variety in my appearance, which once again, this game does practically does not have.\n\nSecond, story seems pretty generic. World is in trouble, gods need you, yadada. No biggy, it's hard to find an original premise for stories these days. But the world itself is pretty cool. GFX aren't the best of 2015, but it's a F2P....no complaints for not having billion dollar budget GFX.\n\nThe controls and camera are what cut my time short in this game honestly. I can deal with lack of variety, a medoicre story, crappy graphics...but holy crap...Q and E do not strafe and the camera has to be manually turned. Your A and D keys to not turn your character, but strafe instead. All turning requires the mouse and often times you turn the camera but your character will keep running in the direction you were originally running (AKA character doesn't turn with the camera). I spent more time trying to move and target enemies than actually fighting...I think the only other MMO I've played that had that kind of control/camera system MIGHT have been Lineage II, but even it wasn' this bad.\n\nCombat, pretty generic point-and-click spam your rotation MMO. I personally like those kinda of combat system, but the camera issues really throw a wrench into this game...\n\nAll-in-all, I haven't dont anything outside of the little noob area (hell, didn't even finish that) but based on my experience here....this game is far from being any big award winners. Not the best, no the worst...but definitely not worth the time if you're looking for a good consistent MMO.\n\nI may re-do this review later, but I feel like I will probably never devote enough time to do the game a fully unbiased review.","June 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

I haven't played it an exorbtitant amount, but I have had quite a bit of fun with the time I have had. So far the only 2 complaints I have are as follows:\n1) The sheer number of foreign language speakers on The NA server. Its not that I am against foreign language, but its far past the point where they should have made servers specifically for these other groups, because they aren't exactly a minority group. Its actually starting to cause problems when grouping with other people for dungeons.\n2) I actually find this one a tad amusing: The censorship system. It censors any words that are specified inappropriate, maybe a little TOO well. Even if the letters are in seperate words, like Four's Excellence, its censors the letters xD\nAs for the pro's to the game, there are quite a few, so I will confine it to 5.\n1) The music, Oh good grief the music! It is AMAZING, it fits very well, and right off the bat on opening the title menu my first day I felt at home\n2) The graphics. Now some of you may think "ok, its got good graphics, so what?" but I'm not saying, jacking it up all the way to ultra, even at minimum, which I found to be just as manageable as other MMORPG's, the graphics are stellar. So if you are looking to focus on game performance over graphics quality, you aren't sacrificing a whole lot by running minimum.\n3) The player base seems to be quite friendly thus far. Although not a whole lot of questions have been answered for me, there are still plent of friendly people I have run into. Dont take that to mean this game has no trolls, every mmo does to some extent, but the people who are friendly go above and beyond ^_^\n4) The skill paths for classes are quite simple, but it still requires a bit of careful planning to get a suitable combination.\n5) The main hub for the first large zone has ALOT to do, and is quite large. I didn't do a whole lot of exploring, but there were quite a few vendors.\n\nI hope this has helped to some degree, and if you have any questions that this review failed to answer, please feel free to ask in the comments below ^_^","March 11","true","258.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","8","8","3","2"

The bgs are really cool and this game is still relatively new so they might add another which I think they should consider.\n\nI haven't done much PVE yet but I watched some videos of the raids and they seemed like really long fights that actually required tactics, to say the least I was impressed by the videos I saw. (looks like there is legitimate gear progression as well that makes the pve content last a long time).\n\nI have played this for about 13 hours at the time of this post and I have to say it has enough unique elements to make it a little different than a few mmos as far as professions and the soul system. (and combat seeing as there is no dedicated healing class).\n\nKind of like gw2 meets fable meets wow but unlike gw2 it actually has a feeling of progression instead of running around having no idea what your doing. There is an npc in the main town that gives you a quest to go to a level appropriate zone if you outlevel the content you were previously on, which can happen if you run dungeons and do a pvp daily after level 15 that gives a level each day basically. (which I was impressed with).\n\nI have yet to do a party dungeon but I am leveling a tank and I have done a few solo dungeons (I am only level 24) and they seemed to be pretty solid and I can start to see how the mechanics work and its really exciting.\n\nThe numbers aren't too big either which is what I like. The damage output is similar to burning crusade wow atleast from what it looks like. I don't think this game can mess up the system they have very easily so it feels like a good enough investment spending my time here.\n\nMuch better than other Anime Mmos seeing as Aura Kingdom's level grind is insane and doesn't seem to have endgame whats so ever and Mabinogi is out dated and theres no reason to log on besides troll free loot events.\n\nI have been around, played a lot of anime mmo's off and on just as a troll for fun and this one impressed me enough to write a review and I haven't even played it that long.\n\niz pretty cool.","February 15","true","26.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Unless your a wizard at making gold (game currency) in MMO's i'd stay WELL clear of this game. Here's why...\n\nAll MP/HP pots/scrolls are 1 silver.. but when you hit level 60, you cant use the potions lower than that level, which means you need to buy the lvl 60 pots/scrolls.. these cost like 300 silver+ just for ONE.. trust me, getting 1 gold in the game would take you a good few quests early on, at top level it's NOT so hard.. BUT here's the thing.. you NEED these items at 60 in dng's.. so, no cash.. no pots/scrolls.. no heals.. no parties want you.. you gold is GONE in hours that took you WEEKS to save up.\n\nThe only thing possible to do is use the gold sellers, but by doing that you will run the risk of having your account/game hacked, so I would NOT recommend doing that.. I would recommend just staying FAR AWAY from this game.\n\nThe game itself looks amazing at a lot of the places you go too, though the few starter zones/areas look REALLY BAD! and most people would take one look at it and quit within 20mins of playing, I nearly did, im glad i played on though because even though the gold thing is a MAJOR problem.. the game itself is NOT that bad and I can't knock the rest of the game because of MY issues I have making gold in mmo's... unless I cash-shop items and sell them in the auction or whatever.. I stopped doing that a LONG time ago.\n\nThe gold, hp/mp pot/scroll cost is an issue that Aeria REALLY needs to sort out but are refusing too.. this is the WORSE game in their catalogue of mmos by far, and I know because I've played all the games they offer.. even the mobile phone games. Aeria are WELL KNOWN for scamming their gamers with HIGH COST currency so I really should'nt be suprised at what a mess this game is currently in, especially with a Dev.Team that can't even keep a scheduled maintenance on track.. LOL! 9 hours for a single maintenance that only fixed minor bugs/issues.. THAT happened this week by the way, and all we got from the GM's on the forums shoutbox was them calling us noobs, and saying every hour.. the game should be back online shortly..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genname/recommended/290140/","genname","Generic Name","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genname/","97 products in account","Echo of Soul is one of those games you pick up when you're bored and want to play some anime styled free2play MMO but have already played the well known games like Mabinogi, Maplestory, Aura Kingdom, Elsword, and the like. It's your typical, run of the mill tab target MMO that doesn't require much thinking. And for that it's great, but man the game does get boring rather quickly.\n\nGraphics: They're good; not 10/10, but unless you're a big name developer your game isn't going to have 10/10 graphics anyway, and this is the case of Echo of Soul. Character models look alright, though I wish the archer elf model didn't have such huge ears. This is one of my gripes with MMOs anyway that feature elves; why must they always have huge pointy ears? I blame LOTR and other franchises, but that's neither here nor there. As for the game environment, it's alright. Standard MMO fare, nicely modeled but still a bit rough around the edges, but that's to be expected. I will give props to the user interface and the control system though. The UI is very intuitive and easy to understand while the control system is very familiar; plus, the drop system actually makes sense and doesn't act funky when dealing with multiple mobs (unlike Aion, which is incredibly finicky and bulky).\n\nGameplay: As I have said (and so have others), it's a tab-targeting system. Playing as an elf huntress was rather easy; just click and spam skills at enemies, no need to memorize rotation or worry about cooldown times; just click away. I confess though I am not at end game, so maybe this changes when you reach level 60. That said, gameplay is very, very, very basic at this point and I can see why some people might get turned off and not reach end game. It's just pick up quests from one area->kill the monsters/pick up drops->turn into respective NPC->repeat process. Heck, even the map layounts don't change much and are easy to memorize. It turns into one large area with four small areas connected to the side; complete all the side areas, move onto the next, and you're done. Combine that with the questing process and the combat system and you have yourself a game that is so brainless you can play it half asleep - hell, I've done it.\n\nSound: Nothing fancy; moving on. Music is pretty average for this game as well, but I wasn't expecting anything else.\n\nUltimately the game's averageness is its own undoing. Boring combat, repetitive quests and predictable area mapping makes for a painfully mediocre game. I can't think of a game that is just more "there" than this. I also find it hard to recommend. One one hand, not recommending it is not being fair; the game isn't terrible, but recommending it would give it too much credit. Maybe the game is there to sate our hunger for average MMOs, but there are better MMOs out there. But if you played all those MMOs already, there is this.","April 9","false","44.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

I came here looking for a fun Free-2-Play MMORPG, and I got what I wanted. I would give it a 90% rating in the MMO category. For my group of friends it was kind of a WoW/Lineage 2 revival. Easy to get into it, fun PvP and dungeons, and I especially like the game-design and art style (even though on the tech side the game is not The Witcher III, let's face it ^^ But my laptop could run it pretty smooth in high, it looks sharp).\n\nSure it's not revolutionary and it doesn't have a special feature that stands out, but it becomes more and more attractive and interesting as you play the game. It has all the features I was looking for, different types of PvP, a ton of dungeons to farm gear, cool mounts and pets (if you like lamas you'll love riding them in this game lol), nice crafting systems, a pretty extensive job system and the end-game content seems huge (even though I have done much myself after I hit level 60, I need a bit more time to look into it as I was having some fun in PvP for a while and put the dungeons/questing on the side).\n\nIt's pretty easy to get into it even for MMORPG beginners, the interface is user friendly, and I found the learning curve well done. I felt I actually needed some time to master some skills and to start feeling powerful, which is a good thing IMO (I don't like hen its too easy). I got crushed my first few times in PvP but now I actually do quite well without spending a single penny and without having amazing skills myself.\n\nOn the negative side, I would say that there is some grinding involved that can become a bit boring at some point. I don't mind farming personally, but I know some friend wanted to progress a bit faster. Yet, nothing crazy either, still in line with many other MMORPGs, especially those coming from Asia.\n\nRegarding the debate "P2W or not", it didn't felt Pay-2Win to my eyes, especially in comparison to some other Free-2-Play MMOs. Sure there is a shop, but you can get most stuff via in-game drops, via the magic egg system (cool idea for free players), or by buying in the auction house. I have some friends who spent some cash on the game to buy some mounts and costumes plus some boosts for leveling, but in PvP we were on the same level. So all good from my point of view on that side. Might consider spending if I continue to play for a while, but I don't feel forced to do so...\n\nSo overall I really like the game and will continue to play for a while. It's perfect for casual MMO players but also interesting for experienced players. Found the game well balanced and not Pay-2-Win so far. A good example of what a F2P MMORPG should be!","June 22, 2015","true","20.7"," 62 of 115 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","62","115","3","8"

Take a break and go right back at it.\n\nThurely enjoying the game so far and I hope to see more of you on EoS soon.","June 23, 2015","true","15.9"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","0"

At the same time though, the game is decent and fun once you get past the first standard leveling bit.\n\nThe bosses in the dungeons have some cool mechanics even already early on and the group dynamics are mostly cool. The highly acclaimed "missing heal class" is a bit of an overstatement though - instead you just go and shield and redistribute HP, etc. so it is almost like healing classes.\n\nPVP is pretty fun when you find the right group to play with - a couple of different game modes you can spend your time with and I would bet that guild play should be a nice thing for end game. The whole enchanting system gives you a purpose for running dungeons to just get the last bit of extra out of your gear. Of course they sell ♥♥♥♥ in the shop to get an edge for these things - on the other hand though even if I am willing to spend money, I still have to farm a lot of gold in order to get the enchanting done. So the gap between players should not be that big - especially since the power curve is not as drastic (unless of course you go up against like a +12 and you are +2 with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gear)\n\nSo give it a try, especially if you have some buddies that will play along with you. You can get quite far without spending money, especially when you join a guild so no real risk there.","July 2, 2015","true","12.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Many will not play it hardcore BUT it will give you something to do while you wait for the games you want to play.\n\nSecondly : NO FREE MULTIPLAYER GAME WILL HAVE SOMETHING NEW TO INTRODUCE - because it's FREE. To have something new to introduce you would have to pay for it, simple as that. Who would bother to give something new without gething something in return, let's be realistic.\n\nWhile it doesn't have anything new to introduce, it does have an interesting story, YES - I'm one of those who actually read the story - , while the graphics are not the NEXT GEN they aren't bad at all, good music,\n\nBut there is one thing that not many multiplayer games use : IT HAS NO HEALER CLASS - which is awesome because you actually have to think about survival and buffs and worry about your health.\n\nSo if you want to have an interesting adventure and do some strategic thinking while you're at it PLAY IT.

In case you still decide to play level 35 can be achieved in an incredible short time. The economy has become completely broken by the cash shoppers like every other game where f2p is not f2p. Do not pvp in this game if you want your time wasted when a new seaon comes they completely wipe your gear... Anyone who puts money into this game (and tbh even playing it at this point...) is completely wasting their time. Do not fall for this scam...Do not fall for Aeria, they are a waste of what could be a reasonably good development crew.\n\nLet's not fail to mention this either...\n\nThere have been multiple incidents where this have occured and not just with myself but many people who have played the game.\n\nAeria, at least for this game that I know of, uses a SEPERATE login server and game server.\n\nMeaning whenever you login to the game of course you have to go through ANOTHER server so when the login server crashes you have 2 options...\n\n1) Wait for the servers to be fixed then get on and be told that they will compensate everyone for the login servers being down... one of two things will happen here either you get ONE of these blessings: Edun's, Njord's, and (if the problem was that huge of an occurance) Levina's (+4 Atk 2hours, +4% Def 2hours, Double EXP and Gold for 24 hours <---- rare)\n\n2) IF you are in game then you cannot log out which of course isn't that hard to do EXCEPT when Aeria is fixing their login servers SOMEHOW they screw up the game servers also leaving you to inevitable crash while they fix the problem.\n\nAfter they have this problem occur they undergo a maintenance to "fix" the issue i.e. after the "fix" is done you can't login because its still broken...\n\nThat's just trying to get in game and stay in game...\n\nThe P2W or might as well call it P2P...\n\nNow I am completely free to play in the game yet I am still the best Stormguard in the game but... It does not stop people from judging people about their gems. Anyone who knows me in game immediately wants my help with dungeon DPS but when you go into a dungeon and have to tell 4 random morons talking about gems to shut it and watch the DPS meter only for a F2P to come out on top they get livid....EXTREMELY livid. So besides the P2W to just be complete BS for PvE the player base is rather saddening.\n\nBut PvE is where the chance to "win" stops lets go to PvP\n\nAt first everything was okay people were learning and figuring things out so you could fight and in that time gather gear to keep yourself balanced with them BUT the new players were matched against the "skilled" (P2W theres no skill in opening a wallet) players its like watching a gazelle try to befriend a lion. But... it managed to get remarkable worse..\n\nAs I stated earlier they released PvP Season 2 (Even the developer himself stated that it wasnt a pvp based game).\n\nBefore the occurance of Season 2 GM's stated that you should quickly use your pvp currency because they would be wiped. However, they FAILED to mention anything about a PVP GEAR WIPE. So many people F2P and P2W began grinding gear in the last few moments of the first season. Just to have it completely replaced with newer higher level gear.\n\nWell you might be thinking now, "Why's he ♥♥♥♥♥ing about this? It means everyone is on fair ground."\n\nNo...no it doesn't allow me to explain.\n\n( Keep in mind that all gem scalings are the same and that the next tier of gem only increase the item level that it can be slotted into.)\n\nA gem in this case lets use an Onyx a gem that is slotted into a helmet in order to increase the CRIT ACC stat from the helm.\n\nBefore the math begins lets start with a helm that just has 100 Base Crit Acc a +1 Dull Onyx or Lucid Onyx would both apply this affect:\n\n+1 Crit Acc + 4% Crit Acc (of the base stat so +4) coming out to an added +5\n\nNow this isnt much but the items you would use in pvp have MUCH higher base stats and youre not going to be running around with anything lower than +5\n\nNow if you use a +6 you get :\n\n+6 +26% (of base stat)\n\nIf the item only has a 100 thats a messley 32 stat points big woop...\n\nLets kick it up to the P2W's +11 Lucid jewels (no one has a +12 jewel yet but i will supply the scaling for all jewels anyway)\n\n+11 +91% (of base stat) <--- yea thats right 91% that doubles the 100 stats to 202 but as you increase in gear of course that +11 wont double it but 91% sure about does.\n\nNow coming soon there will be a new gem the "Intermediate gem" the lucid is consider a low rank gem...\n\nBut what happens when the Intermediates come out? Gem wipe....you just spent several thousand of USD to have it thrown away wouldn't you feel smart.\n\nI will leave this with a chart of gem scaling of +1 to max +12\n\n\n+1        +1 +4%\n+2        +2 +6%\n+3        +3 +9%\n+4        +4 +13%\n+5        +5 +19%\n+6        +6 +26%\n+7        +7 +35%\n+8        +8 +46%\n+9        +9 +59%\n+10      +10 +74%\n+11      +11 +91%    <--- highest lucid obtained so far by date of review\n+12      +12 +110%  <--- highest dull obtained\n\nNote: Dull Gems are no able to be used in items of 64 item level or higher so you must swap to lucid.\n\nSomeone in +8 gear is able to 1 HIT someone in +5 or +6 and someone in +11's can one hit anyone in +9 or lower and devestate someone in +10\n\nAs I said the 100 base stat was a mere example main items have stats more that quadruple that of an item that would have any 100 base stat.","October 29, 2015","false","18.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laceras/recommended/290140/","Laceras","Laceras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laceras/","42 products in account","EOS is a new cutesy anime style MMORPG with the classic MMO elements but a slight difference. You can relate it to WoW in terms of combat(for some part), nothing is seemingly new for such a new MMO, I will say its very well done for what it is. My long review, I hope this helps any one on edge about playing or not. Also consider it a mini basic things to know of the game.\n\nCash shop?\nYes. P2W? I wouldn't say yes or no it this. Everything in game can be purchased with gold through the market from other players, some cash shop items through the "magic egg system", and others from events. Basically anything from the cash shop can be gotten with gold,  and at a much, much slower and less probable rate via Magic Lamps(purchased with eggs)\n\nPvP?\nYes Battlegrounds, Arena,  and its well done to a point. A player over level 10 may join the BG's and its a great way to level. Gems can be used on Equipment to improve your stats as well. Anything over +5 means you will need a Safeguard(use magic eggs, cash shop, Lamps(random), market, to get) to ensure that your gems do not break when you upgrade them, but no guarentee they will upgrade. This system can greatly unbalance PvP but as long as you do your share of the work you will be rewarded, win or lose. I cannot say for that you are guarenteed rewards in arena with a lose though as I have yet to do that. Its a lot of fun but you may also find yourself wanting to bash your head off the wall at some of the players.\n\nGuild Battles?\nYes! Open world guild pvp makes it a bit harder if you are lower level and new to the game. However avoiding a hostile guild is best until you are familiar and comfortable with the game and your class.\nGuilds can compete in Valhalaa, where guilds will compete to kill a daily spawn boss for amazing rewards that will benefit your guild.\n\nDungeons?\nYes! My favourite part of this game is the level 60 dungeons. The game does start you small, giving you regular and heroic soloable dungeons to do starting from level 10 until 60! This is a great way to learn boss fights and mechanics until you can get to level 60 and begin heroic party dungeons. The game holds your hand though in the fights and will tell you what to do and when to do it, so long as you can read! Epic PvE armor will drop at random during each level 60 party dungeon. There is a weekly limit cap on how many of each specific dungeon you can do, starting at 4. You can increase this with dungeon tickets x 2(bought from market, magic eggs, found in lamps) or reset one of your uses with 1 ticket. You will get 30 gold per dungeon I believe. 10gish per boss. Its great for earning gold and then you can afford to upgrade gems or buy cool things this way!\n\nRaids?\nComing Soon~\n\nProfesions?\nYes, you will be able to choose 2 hobbies and 1 profession. The 2 hobbies are Cooking and Soul Processing. Both are important and should always be learned right away. The 3 Professions are Resource Collector, Jeweler, Alchemist. Unfortunately there is no armor, weapon or bag crafting but those come easy enough. I would have loved to see FISHING Q.Q\n\nCooking: Energy and Satiety play a big role in buffing your attack and HP. Energy is used when you use any skill! Satiety fades slowly with time and will determine your hunger level. If you are full you cannot eat any more food to increase your energy, energy is what specifically increases your attack and HP. You can either use a Digestant(Cash shop item, market item, lamps.) to lower your satiety, or wait it out. Digestants can also be obtained from questing in the highest level questing zone.\n\nI feel like I should shut up at some point so maybe now. Overall its a newer game in a old school MMORPG style, great for killing time and probably getting really in to. You will find nothing new here but if you love Anime and MMO's then this just might be your game. At least until Blade & Soul or Black Desert. . .","June 22, 2015","true","2.4"," 36 of 68 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","36","68","2","0"

I didnt expect to like the game as much as I do, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic free to play mmo rpg. There is so much to do once you hit 60 (max level) and it continues to be a very enjoyable game. Also, there is absolutely no pay to win aspect which is fantastic seeing as its a F2P RPG. If you can get past the fact that there is gender locking (I know, its 2015 and gender locking shouldn't be a thing in RPG MMOs anymore) it is a very fun game to play. Updates every few weeks to keep the game interesting and I hope they continue to grow and improve the game. Dont get me wrong, there are a number of faults with this game but nothing to make you steer clear of atleast giving this game a try for yourself. Gender Locking is a problem, but they make up for it with decent customization. Balance between classes is a bit off, but you can make up for it with skill.

Generic evil entity wants generic fantasy world to end, and generic hero player starts the game while generic war ensues with generic guards fighting generic red demon monsters. Blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda, skip all the generic dialogue and cutscenes, blah.\nLook I'm going to break it down really to just the pro's and con's.\n\nPros:\n- Volume slider available during cutscenes (Actually clever!)\n- It's 'alright' looking, graphically speaking\n- Strip to your underwear (Maybe it's a pro, maybe it's a con? I dunno it's up to you, I ain't judgin')\n- Clothing/Armour is tasteful (A little risque, but not TERA levels of skimpy.)\n\nCons:\n- Combat is generic, slow, and boring.\n- Storyline/Plot is generic, borning, and uninteresting.\n- Voice acting is 'alright' I guess? Certainly by no means amazing, but not the worst I've heard.\n- Gender locked classes (So much for "advanced character customization")\n- Limited keybindings (Skill/Item/Mount bindings restricted to 1 - =, F1 - F12)\n- Lots of wasted space (Useless 'between zone' zones filled with useless trash mobs deisgned only to waste your time.)\n\nNeedless to say that I don't reccommend this game, however that's not to say it's bad, it's just nothing special. Look, if you like generic MMORPG's, give it a shot, but don't expect anything amazing because I guarantee you won't find it. As far as PvP is concerned, I didn't bother to try it simply because I personally don't care for PvP, however if it follows suite with the rest of my experience, it's probably just as generic as you'd expect.","June 30, 2015","false","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a simple go here and get this MMO.\n\nI'll explain why It made me bittersweet.\n\nI like pretty games. I liked the outfits, the graphics were good.\nI even liked the Soul part of the game. It was fairly interesting.\n\nBut...The quests were the same. I did a dungeon by myself. There was no need to play with other players.\n\nThe reason it made me bittersweet is because I did like the game concept. The battling was nice, but the battling threw me off because I couldn't move much. ( I was an archer.) The sidestep was literally pointless, I don't know why they bothered to put it there, but I did like the Soul stuff. How you would have wings of color on your back. I thought it was cool.\n\nSo basically\n\nPro: Good graphics. Interesting concept with souls.  Pantie shots. >->\nThe battling was decent. The story was okay. Not the best. Music was decent too.\n\n\nCons: Sidestepping was pointless. ( I like to move when I'm battling.)\nThe quests were go here and get that. Basically, gathering and killing things.\n\n\nEven though it looks like the pros outweight the cons. The quests are the MAIN part of the game and for that. It sufferered a thumbs down for me.  Sorry Aeria. Not your best game, but it's decent if you're looking for a simple MMO.\n\n","July 5, 2015","false","6.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't see where the negative reviews are coming from. The visuals are stunning, cute female characters, combat is fun and teamwork is involved to make the most out of party experience... this is one of the finest modern MMOs I have played. The game is free and everything is in real time. None of that FFXIII BS.\n\nIf you decide to play the first sequence of quests (which I'd agree are boring, fetch questing and generic) it would take approximately 4 hours and I'd recommend trying to go through it if only for the tutorials. When you reach the main city Ignea, you will be able to access Battlefield merchants and daily rewards which is great. It's like a MOBA within the RPG. Its a lot of fun especially with friends.\n\nIf you are offered an opportunity to join a guild, join up. Guild members are among the most helpful players around and will even offer newer players with commitment free items and will take time from their own day to help you with dungeons, resources, etc.\n\nThe REAL fun starts when you reach 60. You will have access to a slew of solo dungeons, dailies and a seperate lv60 Battlefield and Arena. Some of the daily quests are a bit of grind, but the rewards you reap can get you Magic Eggs which is sort of like f2p premium currency... using the eggs you can get Dungeon Tickets or Magic Lamps which will give you untradeable variants of premium AP bought items.\n\nThis game is NOT play to win and most of the items in the store are cosmetics. There is an insta-lv60 kit for sale but that is reserved to players who ALREADY put work into leveling at least one other account to 60 first!\n\nSo my advice is not to quit within the first 4 hours... once you reach Ignea and run the battlefield 'til 60, you will end up having so much fun. I actually stuck with the main quest line and did all the side quests in between and it took me about 40-50 hours, but then I decided to do dungeons and pvp instead and that has granted me over 100 hours of gameplay to boot.\n\nAddendum: Huntresses and Duelists are OP, but instead of complaining about balance in classes, why not create one for yourself? Its what you make of it and what is tailored to your playstyle. I like the Huntress a LOT for PVP but started off as an assassin rogue which I personally find great for PvE.","January 31","true","628.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However what the game lacks in is what most games in whole lack in, that's captivating the player with the starter quests of the game and throwing all you can to that point of the game, leaving the rest of the main quests not exciting like saving women from beasts or searching the shops for a cute plushie. I highly recommend this TPS MMORPG game to patient people. People who can stand killing the same things over and over again, With a slight change in loot collected or loot needed to complete the quest. In the game there are a series of bugs and glitches and simple mistakes that take time out of your gameplay to abondon the quest and re-do it. For example you deleting a quest item on accedent and having to abandon it and collectit back, Although this is a player based thing, we shouldn't be aloud to delete or sell any quest item in the game, also if a bug happens during the main quest when you're half way through it... Believe me i speak from experience that it is plain annoying that you needing to spend an extra twenty muinets going through the quest and completing it again with you knowing how you could've completed the game half an hour prier.\n\nStill, i'm not hating on the game for what it is. The game is a average game with a huge helping community, without the mass spam of ingame payments.","December 15, 2015","true","64.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I know I have tons of hours on this game, but truth be told it's because I love the friends I've made on it. Pvp before level 60 is more fun than when you hit 60 because it's closer to being balanced than after you reach cap level. The quests are a bit repetitive, but if you do them with a friend or two, it can be fun. I've made numerous characters and they all have their pros and cons.\n\nAs for the game, itself...it's okay. Not excellent, but not awful. It depends on what you're looking for.\n\nAs for the pay to win aspect that many are curious about...before you hit level 60, I'd say no...it's not pay to win at all. You can progress the entire time without spending a dime. The dull gems come easy and will be free to enhance for your gear. As for when you hit 60? It may tend to feel a little pay to win-ish only because you will need premium items to help you enhance your gems as you will no longer be able to use dulls. I was disappointed when they released antlers/santa hat that offered extra stats for pvp, being that the majority of the people using them were those that were already pretty much the strongest on the game, but at the end of it all...it's no different than the pet whistles you get if you purchase the correct sets of pets in game.\n\nDo I recommend it? Sure...but I'm also not blind to it's faults.\n\nBattlefield needs a serious overhaul, more maps, and either they separate those ubers from us regulars in game or they need to fix it so you can't form premade teams. Why? Because it's no fun playing against a team of premium barbarians. When you end up with scores like 10k-1k, something is definitely wrong. People have taken to staying in base and waiting for the round to be over because they can't cap towers/grab resources or defend themselves.\n\nThe dungeons aren't so bad, but it would be nice for it to drop gear pieces of the classes in the party running them. It's so frustrating to waste heals (expensive once you hit 60) to run a dungeon just to end up with drops that no one can use. One of the biggest reasons, I mostly play pvp even though that is a headache in itself.\n\n\nI'd give the game a 7/10\n","January 11","true","623.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BioKat/recommended/290140/","BioKat","BioKat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BioKat/","16 products in account","Right from the bat, I knew this game was going to be a polarizing one. To begin, classes are gender-specific. If you want to play a female rogue, well tough luck. There isn't a lot of customization in character creation, so you'll find several copies of your character once you're out on the field. The graphics are nice, but it's nothing special.\n\nIt's fairly easy to level up quickly, but it's also very boring. Quests are the generic "kill this many creatures," "gather this many items," or "kill creatures to gather this many items that may or may not drop." The skill tree is not extensive. This might be good for first-time MMORPG players who can better understand the simplified rundown of skillsets. But again, this brings back the con of lack of customization. A serious flaw with this game (in my opinion) is how difficult it is to earn money. This makes professions useless and expensive in the earlier levels.\n\nLike many F2P games, there is a cash shop. While the game doesn't shove the fact in your face as much as others, the fact that there are actually quests in the game that requires you to purchase an item from the cash shop just irks me. Also like many F2P games, PVP is horribly unbalanced. Some classes far outlast others in the battleground. Archers are the devil.\n\nThis is just your average MMORPG. It will keep you entertained for a few hours before you get tired of the redundancy.","December 21, 2015","false","19.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Small details here and there. It is very standard and very expected. Quest hubs, typical class's with dual specs, instances, etc etc. The hole thing is very common but yet very well done and tweaked to be very enjoyable.\n\nI really like this game and so far i didn't find any cons to it yet.

I don't write reviews here but it is kind of unfair to have mixed review for this game, for it one of the better F2P MMORPGs you can find out there.\n\nStory might be boring, graphics might look outdated but if you pass through these, you will find an MMO which is quite fun to play with interesting classes and solid character improvement. Also ,crafting is very detailed and deep without overwhelming the player with tons of informations. It comes with time, naturally.\n\nIt might be bad for some but I find it great that leveling quite easy (you can reach max level in around 40 hours) and there is a lot of end game content to keep you occupied. If you are into competitive game, you can go PVP and if you are into cooperative game you can go for dungeons and epic raids.\n\nEOS might took a couple pages from the "if it aint broke, don't fix it" manual and instead put together an MMO that trys to appeal to all gamers. It might fall a little short in some areas, but overall it's a fun and solid experience.\n\nI would give it a 7 out of 10 and would also recommend you to give it a try.

I did like that it gave you mounts, but I wish that we are able to fight on them, or even gather plants or items from them instead of just the 'faster' transport that they allow.

I came to this game out of pure boredom. Let us just say, it didn't fix my problem. Classes are gender/race locked, visuals are pretty horrid. While the character models seem decent, the terrain/environment is ugly as ♥♥♥♥. Leveling is generic and boring, though I don't expect any more from an mmo tbh. Quest leveling is hard to escape. You unlock PvP at level 10. You can level via battlegrounds if you like, though it isn't well balanced atm and you're GOING to get wrecked, especially as a Rogue. So far my PvP experience has been rough, with players constantly shouting to do things a certain way and to "gtfo". None of this being aimed at me as far as I know but honestly the PvP is pretty easy to grasp. From the modes i've played it's just capping ♥♥♥♥. I've only played for about 4 hours so I can't really say anything about much else. So far, I think most should pass on this, unless you're insanely bored, or don't have a better mmo to play.

However, all of them grew boring rather quickly, so I do not particularly like MMOs, mainly because of the slow progression / grind and the very static worlds, as there can be no big changes resulting from your actions, as the next player must have the same content available.\nI am also not interested in PvP, so I cannot say anything about this here.\nThe playtime recorded by Steam might be rather low, when you read this, but I played the game for a longer time before, as it was released on Aeria Games' own website some time before the Steam release.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nI gave Echo of Soul a fair try, as with those other games. In the end I must say, that I am positively surprised.\nThe PvE balancing and Quest goals are done in a way, that does not halt your progression through the game. The flow feels like Diablo 3 i.e. you keep moving through the game without being forced to stop and grind in one area.\nThey also use the phasing system that games like World of Warcraft used, so that the world around you actually is able to change in response to completed quests. For example, early in the game you arrive at a town, which is on fire and overrun by enemies. After you save it, the world changes and the town is normal again, functioning as a regular in-game hub with merchants and players etc.\n\nVISUALS\nThe graphics and design are nothing new or spectacular, but EOS does look very nice and inviting. In addition it has it's own charm, as you can create quite extravagant characters. You have a variety of unusual hair and skin colors to select from and the size slider has a big range as well. It is not as expansive as some other games, but definitely good enough to not be limiting.\n\nCASH SHOP\nI read in other reviews, that the game feels Pay to Win for them. Looking at the items available on the Cash Shop, I can understand this notion, as some items seem quite powerful. But in all the time I played, I never actually felt compelled to buy anything there, as the game's balancing does not feel, like I would really need any of them. The only thing that really is of interest, are the extended bags, as there is quite some loot to carry around after some time of play. Even the standard mounts, of which you get one very early in the game, are sufficient, so you do not need to buy a better one.\n\nTECHNICAL\nI did not encounter any serious lag or other technical issues. The game ran smooth and stable for me. There was only some lags on the release day, a couple of weeks ago, but that is completely normal for an MMO. I read that some people's Antivirus software is giving warnings, but this also happens with many online games, as the Anti-Hack tools can be seen as false positives by those Antivirus tools. I personally did not have this issue.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nEcho of Soul is nothing new or extravagant. It is competent, solid and the actual gameplay is done in a way that it is entertaining without any grind. It might not be made for the hardcore players or those that want a great PvP game. But if you are looking for a good time in PvE, Echo of Soul is definitely worth a try.\n\nTL;DR:\nOverall I can recommend it. Good PvE, no grind, Cash Shop can be ignored without problems. No lags or other technical issues that I saw.","June 26, 2015","true","23.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Leveling is relatively linear, though you can decide to do so through PVE or PVP, with everything pushing you to end game. You pick up a mount early on and quest drops drop pretty often, which is pretty nice.\n\nThere are a few negatives, there's a cash shop quest early on, though it's skippable and after that you don't really hear from it again. Also the classes are gender-locked which isn't a huge deal breaker for me, but I know it can be for some people.\n\nTL;DR The game is not reinventing the wheel, but what it does it actually does quite well, so definitely worth to give it a try.","June 23, 2015","true","27.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The UI is very user friendly and compiles a lot of cool features (e.g. inventory manager). Early levels a bit boring, the game really starts around lvl 50. The progression until then is a grinding & quests or PVP battlegrounds.\n\nThe soul and crafting systems are also interesting and featuring a lot of cooperation aspects (coop refining, complementary jobs). They are maybe too simple and straightforward (small amount of materials, recipes), do not offer a lot of different specs but at least they give useful items.\n\nThe cash-shop offers a lot of stuff, like mounts, vanity items and boosters. The costumes aren't coming with any statistic, only vanity. Some boosters are available (4% atk/def, 30% pvp marks, +100% xp/gold) - the rest is mostly convenience such as character slots, bags, and other crap. Most items are tradable and available for gold at the AH, so people who don't spend can still access almost every item item that could break the balance - EoS honeypots you to spend some cash but is not P2W imo - i bought a founder's pack to access CBT and get the limited edition mount but always got cash items vs. gold at the AH since then, including safegards.\n\nPros:\n\n- Pretty graphics (except for these horrible ground textures :s), interesting lore\n- Variety of classes & gameplays\n- Good UI - user friendly\n- Interesting Crafting system + coop soul refining\n- All cash items tradable, therefore the AH is full of cheap cash items for Gold\n- Guild wars and other coop features\n- High level content & raids\n- bad ♥♥♥ sword for warriors\n\nCons:\n\n- Instanced areas and channels (i'm not a fan of this system)\n- Gender-locked classes\n- Lack of low level coop dungeons (35/50 - adding a lvl 20 coop dungeon would be cool)\n- Polished but generic game\n- Lack of pvp battlegrounds\n\n\nIt's free and it's honestly pretty packed for a F2P, there is far worst crap on Steam atm - definitely worth the try.\n","June 24, 2015","true","2.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylek/recommended/290140/","Sylek","Sylek Isana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sylek/","5 products in account","I finally got Echo of Soul to work and wasn't too impressed. I only played one class up to level 9 to at least give it a chance, but it didn't hold out.\n\nPlaying to Game\n\nIn order to actually play this game, I downloaded it through Steam, only to have to download it again from the game's actual website. After transfering some files, the game could be played through Steam. If you're interested in checking this game out for yourself, a walkthrough on how to play it through Steam can be found at the following link. Just click on "Getting EoS to work through Steam" on the right hand side.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/290140#scrollTop=1900\n\nCharacter "Creation"\n\nFirst, is the classes. I'm not overly fond of classes after some of the other mmo's I've played where you can use any (or most) of the skills, equipment, etc. If you don't care whether a game has classes or not, then go ahead and disregard this one, it's just a personal thing for me.\n\nSecond, classes are gender locked. Every warrior is a big, muscular dude with a big sword. Every rouge is a lithe dude who looks like a kid. Every mage is a little girl. You can customize their hair, eyes, face, the colors, and some sizes, and that's all free (at least at creation. I don't know if you can change it later or not). To me, this is picking a character to play and customizing their appearance a little.\n\nQuests\n\nTo be completely honest, I skipped over the dialouge portion of the quests, so I don't have any story other than cutscenes and bosses. I found the quests to be lackluster. Even the MMO's I do like have some of this, but the quests seemed to be sending me to talk to someone, kill some monster, or get something. In addition, each quest was only one task long. While this does get you to the reward faster, it's not as challenging and, in my opinion, is just too simple. I faced, and defeated, two bosses before I was level 8, and that was solo. (that could possibly be a balancing issue, or it could just be simplicity itself).\n\nNew, better equipment for your class is also given away as quest rewards. While this is useful in saving money and not having to bother with shops (I didn't even look at those), it further simplifies the game. If you ever have to use a shop, it'd probably be to sell things and clean out your inventory. Everything you need is given to you when you need it.\n\nSkills\n\nAgain, I only played one class, and not for very long, so I don't have all of the details on this. What I did notice is that your skills are automatically learned and hotkeyed as you level. This does remove the hassle of picking out skills each level, but it also removes the ability to customize your class and play the way you like. Then again, you could just not use the skills you don't care for, but why have them anyway? I'm fine with getting preset skills in other RPG's, but I prefer to customize my MMO characters, whether it's their appearance, gender, or skills.\n\nCash Shop\n\nMany free to play mmo's have this, so I'm not going to complain about it too much. They do have to make money somehow. However, there is at least one quest, albeit optional, where you are to buy something from the cash shop. You are able to abandon the quest, but there'll always be a marker in the second town for a quest you haven't done, because you haven't paid for it.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics were good, I won't complain about those. Characters and terrain are beautiful, monsters are appropirately hideous. This is a good 3D environment, with good character models. I experienced no lag at any point while I was playing. (Don't ask what my settings were at, I never checked.) The graphics may actually be the only thing I actually like about this game.\n\nConclusion\n\nI wasn't very impressed as the game took too much effort to be able to work for a rather generic, simple mmorpg. There are some elements that are unique, but the overall gameplay reminds me of just about every other mmo I've played without the challenges. I didn't browse any shops, pvp, or anything like that. I had no need to check a shop for new equipment, and I've never been overly fond of pvp. If you'd like to give it a try yourself, the link to get it to work through steam is provided above and again below. Just click "Getting EoS to work through Steam" on your right.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/290140#scrollTop=1900","June 27, 2015","false","2.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

I know, I was surprised too.\n\nThe RPG elements are quite simplistic, but I've seen worse. At Level 10, you have to choose a path for your class. Once you've selected a path, every few levels you'll get to choose a new spell, so there is some class customization here. Note: there is no healer class and the five classes are gender-locked. I know this can be a letdown for some people.\n\nThe game is pretty addicting for a while, because you always have something to do, and leveling up is exciting because you always have new spells to look forward to. You get better gear frequently, you keep fighting new monsters and you never stay in the same region for too long.\n\nAlso, the graphics are surprisingly pleasing to look at. This game has some really good animations and sound effects, and plenty of different clothes too.\n\nAs for the general gameplay, it's pretty basic but the controls feel right, and you can even jump! The interface is easy to understand and isn't bloated. Even the little bit of PvP that I tried was enjoyable, since everyone's HP scales up to make it fair for everyone.\n\nThis game does get repetitive, but overall, it's enjoyable if you just want to grind for a while. It's not the kind of MMO that I would recommend playing for several hundreds of hours, but that doesn't make it bad.","August 13, 2015","true","26.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Animation looked nice, presented well. If I were to give any criticism to the aspect of looks, it would be the UI. A lot of MMO's suffer a clutter of menus, chat boxes, maps, lists, and this one is no real exception. But with a bit of tinkering, you can get your layout a bit less cluttered, so it isn't a real problem.\n\nSecond, the system. I feel this is an average system. Much of what I saw didn't surprise me, but it worked well enough. It's in fact simpler than a lot of MMO's, when it comes to upgrading equipment, purchasing and selling on the marketplace, etc. You'll get a hang of it quite quickly with the right intelligence.\n\nCombat was actually pretty well constructed, however, I do feel that fighting isn't very satisfying. Is it balanced? I feel in both PVP and PVE, the devs constructed it well enough to avoid too much inbalance. BUT, there is a catch that comes later... (see final paragraphs)\n\nThird, is it a fun MMO? I would say yes, but only to a point. The quests, as I expected going into this game, repeated themselves. A lot. I mean... a lot. Each time you wish to get to a new exciting area, there's this connecting path that will look the same, and will take you a good half hour to get through.\n\nThe rewards for questing and adventuring are dull. Very dull. The best you'll get is a choice of either weapon A or weapon B. You get the one tailored to your Class skill tree. Done. Next repeat quest, ahoy! Rinse and repeat.\n\nAt level 60 (cap) this game changes dramatically. If you were to go into PVP at level 60 with your new shiny level 60 equipment, expect to get MASSACERED. All of a sudden, you feel very weak. You have all these things to do, all the PVE grinding quests, dungeons, hunting grounds, farming, that it's all just too much. This is where I stopped playing.\n\nI tried to be a level 60, I tried. I even looked up a guide on HOW TO PLAY A LVL 60. The fact I had to do this, in my opinion, brought my rating for this game to 'eenope'. Frankly, it requires so much devotion of time, so much effort, getting shouted at by other players about doing things wrong. It isn't worth the dungeons, wings, and shiny equipment. Just don't bother. It'll suck the life out of you.\n\nIn conclusion, this game can be fun, for a time. But I do not recommend it's worth anymore than a test play.","October 25, 2015","false","183.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

All of the others caused disappointment. But this is just as an RPG MMO should be, nothing special, but everything fit.\n\nPros:\n-good combat system, skill based, so you have to use your brain, but thanks for the popping up Q and E skills it is still dinamic.\n-a lot of very simple but very good solution, like: you can change the graphics settings just by two clicks (literaly), for example in PVE area you keep it on max, but when you join PVP you can choose a lower setting to eliminate the unnecessary shining things and get extra FPS when needed.\n-although the questes are quite tipical, but some NPC are really funny, if you read the text of the questes.\n-graphics is good while it is still running well on older PCs too.\n-Set for European mind: Odin, Gehenna,... the anime feeling is very small.\n-good crafting system but you are not forced to craft if you do not want: in this case you can choose the resource gatherer profession and get money on it.\n-according to my experience it is NOT pay to win.\n-community is helpful and they tipically can behave on an adult way\n\nCons:\n-too fast respawn, sometimes you have not even the chance to get the loot and the mob is already there again.\n-lack of dedicated healer profession\n-sex locked preofessions, but it is not a big problem, professions generally fit for the sex (male warrior, female sorceress,...)\n\nOverall, it's obvious that it has been created by an MMO-experienced team.","September 5, 2015","true","90.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This pretty much sums up the whole game for me. There are only two types of quests in the entire game;\n\n1. Kill X number of identical enemies,\n2. Collect X number of an item.\n\nThe story is bland and tedious and player interaction is minimal. The combat is buttonbashing, because the skills have no  specific visuals or effect other than a minor difference in damage output. Also, it's pretty hard to get killed, except for dungeons, so no real challenges there either.\n\nBUT, for a free game, it's still pretty polished. The cash shop offers vanity items and temp buffs, so it's not really pay2win. Just try it out, if you're into sub-par casual MMO's.","November 6, 2015","false","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Meaning, once you connect one accout with steam,  its permanant so i couldnt link my other account -_- Aside from that, I love the game soo much.\n\nPros\n- Its not a P2W game, Meaning you have to spend time to earn the OP gear\n- Easy to learn and if you know know how to use your class, you can Dominate\n- Everybody has a chance to kill each other, sure the higher level you are in pvp arenas the better you can kill but ultamatly, they try there best to even it out. (Ex. i was level 14 mage, was ranked 8 in pvp arena)\n- I love how simple the MMORPG\n- Some class may be weak in the beggining but later in the higher levels, you can be really helpful later on\n\nCons\n- The MMORPG maybe to simple for you\n- Still fairly new so it wont have much as in Outfit and assesories (im into that :D\n- Some classes may not be OP in the beggining\n\n8/10   All the loli's you could have :D","July 5, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

It becomes very annoying to constantly move through those as well. The end game seems to be either pvp arena/battleground or mass spamming the same dungeons within the weeks rotation. This game doesn't have different factions, so you dont meet any "bad guys" that you need to take out unless you're in a guild that makes you hostile to some of the other guilds.","January 5","false","169.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I find myself enjoying it a lot. Especially the PvP battlefields, they are fast paced generally capture point driven and combat is relatively balanced regardless of your level. (annoying stunlock still occurs, but that's every mmo I've ever played) It's free, there is a cash shop but I've found absolutely no need to actually use it, it's completely voluntary the way it is set up, and lets be honest if you put more than 20 hours into a game you should chip a few bucks the way of the company that provided it. Another feature I like is the ability to solo dungeons, it's doable as pretty much any class and any level. You can get all the gear in the game and never party up if that's the way you want to do things. You can also of course party up, the strangest mechanic there is there is no dedicated healer class in this game. It takes some getting used to. They compensate for that by making potions, revives, and heal scrolls easily and cheaply obtainable at the npc in game shops. I could go on for awhile but despite a lot of complaining and bad reviews I found myself considering this a good game, and will likely give it even more time, and maybe even spend a few bucks on that cash shop just to show my appreciation. Usually these korean cross over mmo's aren't very enjoyable, but this one reminds me of what WoW used to be before they turned it into the lowest common denominator crap that it is now.\n\n\nI highly suggest giving the game a few days and 20-40 levels to make an impression on you. If you can see past it not having the greatest graphics I'm pretty sure you'll find yourself enjoying it. Even though the server populations aren't very high right now, battlefield pvp and dungeon searches usually take only a minute or two and the more the merrier.","July 4, 2015","true","211.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fair enough, this MMORPG will not appeal to everybody but none do (including WoW). This is a F2P game and by no means pay to win. Of course it is possible to level faster and gain weapons/armour sooner if you pay (as I have) but it is just as easy to unlock it. Crafters will be rewarded much more than those who pay and the auction house is a great way of getting some cheap gear.\n\nIf you are looking for a great, free game to sink a couple of hundred hours into then this is one to try.\n\nAlso, the only reason that I don't have much game time is because I do not play this game via Steam!","June 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love it and it isn't as annoying to level up in as compared to games like Lord of the Rings Online. The way it is set up is simple and comfortable to use and in my opinion blows most games away. There are a lot of quests to do and they are pretty simple and short to do compared to quests in games like RuneScape that can take hours even days to complete.\n\nEcho of Souls reminds me a lot of the game Rapelz which is a game I played a lot before getting a new computer and was never able to find again. It is easy to get engrossed into this game and hard to walk away from. This MMORPG is definately one I'd recommened to new gamers as well as veteran gamers. The graphics are impressive and the game runs smoothly. The only problem I can see is the fact that the 5 choices of charector tipes are gender locked, but that doesn't really decrease how much I like this game.\n\nI'd like to thank the people who made it for bringing such an awesome game into existance.","June 29, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wish the classes could be either male or female, but besides that the character design has a good amount of choices.  I really like the levelling system too.  I enjoy having to decide which two abilities I can take and which one I can do without at each "branch."  Customization is important and too many games ignore it.  I have only made it to level 48 so far, but the quests are well written and engage you in the history of the world - if you take your time to read them.  9/10 as far as free to play games go :D","July 13, 2015","true","62.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I personally really enjoy this game, though admittedly it's nothing different or unique. However, I do recommend it:\n\nPros\n+Large and friendly population (And it seems to be growing from what early players have told me)\n+Rewarding combat and there is a need to roll to dodge attacks being charged up by enemies.\n+Rewarding 15vs15 PvP from level 10+ (You play pvp with players from level 10 - 60 all in one game. Everyones stats are scaled to level 60 to balance out the gameplay.)\n+A very large world, especially for a new game, with currently 0 expansions or level cap raises.\n+Pretty game, the graphics are dated but it's still visually gorgeous.\n+Levelling isn't too slow or too fast. I reached level 25 in 10 hours. (Remember the level cap is 60)\n+Group dungeons from level 35+.\n+Innovative and interesting soul collection system.\n+Professions\n+Can choose one of two paths for each class at level 10. (Beserker or Protector Warrior for example)\n\nCons\n-Rather generic, nothing we haven't seen before. (Though for some reason I enjoy this game a lot more than many similar titles.)\n-No innovative classes.\n-Gender locked classes.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun, polished and rewarding MMORPG with a large, active community, I highly recommend this game.\n","July 9, 2015","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I find myself enjoying it a lot. Especially the PvP battlefields, they are fast paced generally capture point driven and combat is relatively balanced regardless of your level. (annoying stunlock still occurs, but that's every mmo I've ever played) It's free, there is a cash shop but I've found absolutely no need to actually use it, it's completely voluntary the way it is set up, and lets be honest if you put more than 20 hours into a game you should chip a few bucks the way of the company that provided it. Another feature I like is the ability to solo dungeons, it's doable as pretty much any class and any level. You can get all the gear in the game and never party up if that's the way you want to do things. You can also of course party up, the strangest mechanic there is there is no dedicated healer class in this game. It takes some getting used to. They compensate for that by making potions, revives, and heal scrolls easily and cheaply obtainable at the npc in game shops. I could go on for awhile but despite a lot of complaining and bad reviews I found myself considering this a good game, and will likely give it even more time, and maybe even spend a few bucks on that cash shop just to show my appreciation. Usually these korean cross over mmo's aren't very enjoyable, but this one reminds me of what WoW used to be before they turned it into the lowest common denominator crap that it is now.\n\n\nI highly suggest giving the game a few days and 20-40 levels to make an impression on you. If you can see past it not having the greatest graphics I'm pretty sure you'll find yourself enjoying it. Even though the server populations aren't very high right now, battlefield pvp and dungeon searches usually take only a minute or two and the more the merrier.","July 4, 2015","true","211.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Of course it is possible to level faster and gain weapons/armour sooner if you pay (as I have) but it is just as easy to unlock it. Crafters will be rewarded much more than those who pay and the auction house is a great way of getting some cheap gear.\n\nIf you are looking for a great, free game to sink a couple of hundred hours into then this is one to try.\n\nAlso, the only reason that I don't have much game time is because I do not play this game via Steam!","June 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love it and it isn't as annoying to level up in as compared to games like Lord of the Rings Online. The way it is set up is simple and comfortable to use and in my opinion blows most games away. There are a lot of quests to do and they are pretty simple and short to do compared to quests in games like RuneScape that can take hours even days to complete.\n\nEcho of Souls reminds me a lot of the game Rapelz which is a game I played a lot before getting a new computer and was never able to find again. It is easy to get engrossed into this game and hard to walk away from. This MMORPG is definately one I'd recommened to new gamers as well as veteran gamers. The graphics are impressive and the game runs smoothly. The only problem I can see is the fact that the 5 choices of charector tipes are gender locked, but that doesn't really decrease how much I like this game.\n\nI'd like to thank the people who made it for bringing such an awesome game into existance.","June 29, 2015","true","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This RPG is great for new and old players alike, the swords are lovingly bigger than Guts "Dragonslayer" and the armor is flashy and stylish like in games like TERA. Id give it overall a 7.5/10, it would have scored 9/10 if not for the games one little problem. this is that all the classes are gender bound, meaning you you can only be a male warrior and rogue, while every other class is female. im sure this is great if the devs thought they were going to attract a ton of female gamers and guys that love playing as women (eww but whatever floats your boat) but in most MMORPGS i try and roll a male wizard or something similar, but in this game decided to try out a warrior for the sole reason that its one of the few male classes, which in an age of games giving you huge control over customization and making your character unique seems like a HUGE oversight. but thats just my take on thing.\n\noverall 7.5/10","July 19, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nothing new or special really but that doesn't detract from playing the game for me which is why I recommend it.  The issues I have with the game don't break the game and make it unplayable and are more just annoyances.\n\nMy only real issues with the game are that your limited on inventory space if you don't want to pay irl cash for the large bags to increase your space.  You can get 5 extra bags that have 6 slots on in them from questing but any more then that and you gotta buy them and you don't really make in game currency all that fast or at least I haven't.\n\nMy other issue is with the professions.  You can have 2 secondary professions which are cooking and soul expert, but you can only have one of the 3 main professions. So you can get resource gathering which as it sounds you just gather resourses and do nothing with them.  The other two are alchemy and jewel crafting.  Note that the issue is that without resourse gathering you can't get the items you would need for the other two professions.  So you can't work on the crafting professions without help and the gathering one juse leaves you with a bunch of resources you can't do anything with besides sell them since you don't have the inventory or stash space to hold onto them for when you replace the gathering profession with a crafting one.\n\nLike I said I still enjoy the game and enjoy playing it but those points just bother me and make the main professions not worth your time to do unless you have a friend who can do the gathering portion for you or you can gather resources for a friend to use.  If not go with the gathering profession and then sell your mats to other users.","July 10, 2015","true","47.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/avibs/recommended/290140/","avibs","Dingerbongle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/avibs/","109 products in account","Echo of Souls is a free to play MMORPG that shares a number of similiarities with World of Warcraft, but also offers a fair bit of differences to World of Warcraft.  While it is not extraordinarily good, it isn't too terrible, either.  I recommend that people are who interested in MMORPGs to at least give this a try.\n\nThe story and lore of Echo of Souls is little more than "just for the sake of being there".  The major conflict centers around a mysterious evil force that seeks to get the mcguffin in order to fulfill their nefarious deeds.  The lore is influenced by Norse mythology, but it seems to be mostly the same generic, "World is in danger, go save it." without much developement or depth to it.  You play as a typical hero who wants to stop the evil dudes and save the day.\n\nThe combat in this game will feel clunky at first.  You are not able to move while using abilities (even if they are instant), resource generators are minimal at low levels (but get better as you gain levels and abilities), and your abilities use a fair amount of resources causing downtime more often than not until you unlock additional resource generators.  As you gain levels, the combat will speed up and feel natural, but never to the point where it will be completely smooth and freeflowing due to the lack of movement while in the animation of an ability.\n\nThe PvE portion of the game is the typical "collect 5 bear asses and turn them in" for the most part, but the monotony is mixed in with interesting diversity in content.  Co-op bosses which are powerful enemies that spawn in zones.  Upon spawning, all players in the area and incoming in the area while the boss is still alive will recieve a quest to kill it.  The tag is shared across all parties, allowing all players in the zone to fight the powerful enemy together, even if they aren't in the same party.  There are also party bosses which require a group in order to take down.  Collecting chaos souls, which drop from enemies, and can be converted into purified souls which grant you bursts of power for a short amount of time.\n\nThe instances in this game are split into solo, party, and 10/25 man raids.  Solo dungeons are fairly easy dungeons that teach you the typical mechanics of the bosses in the game which are usually in the form of "don't stand in circles" and "don't stand near the boss when he spins" and "kill adds".  They are a nice touch to the game, but the lack of pre-cap party dungeons is disappointing (there is only 1 available at 35).\n\nThe lack of a holy trinity does not interfere with the PvE aspects of the game.  Healing is mostly done through the use of healing scrolls and potions while in combat and bandages out of combat.  The former are items that heal a party member instantly and yourself over a short period of time, respectively.  The bandages act like food items in World of Warcraft.\n\nThe PvP content of this game is below average.  The lack of a holy trinity combined with the inability to move while in an ability's animation greatly improves the ability for melee classes to be able to tunnel down ranged classes.  However, ranged classes that are not tunneled down can easily shred enemy players due to the sheer amount of damage they are able to put out while remaining still.  Ranged classes don't have very much escape options besides the roll button, either.  Melee classes also risk being obliterated the moment they charge in due to lack of defensive cooldowns.\n\nOverall, the PvP content seems to be in a strange place and I don't really know what can be done about it.  It's not terrible, but something about it feels wrong.\n\nThere are no toys in this game to have fun with.","July 3, 2015","true","23.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Nothing new or special really but that doesn't detract from playing the game for me which is why I recommend it.  The issues I have with the game don't break the game and make it unplayable and are more just annoyances.\n\nMy only real issues with the game are that your limited on inventory space if you don't want to pay irl cash for the large bags to increase your space.  You can get 5 extra bags that have 6 slots on in them from questing but any more then that and you gotta buy them and you don't really make in game currency all that fast or at least I haven't.\n\nMy other issue is with the professions.  You can have 2 secondary professions which are cooking and soul expert, but you can only have one of the 3 main professions. So you can get resource gathering which as it sounds you just gather resourses and do nothing with them.  The other two are alchemy and jewel crafting.  Note that the issue is that without resourse gathering you can't get the items you would need for the other two professions.  So you can't work on the crafting professions without help and the gathering one juse leaves you with a bunch of resources you can't do anything with besides sell them since you don't have the inventory or stash space to hold onto them for when you replace the gathering profession with a crafting one.\n\nLike I said I still enjoy the game and enjoy playing it but those points just bother me and make the main professions not worth your time to do unless you have a friend who can do the gathering portion for you or you can gather resources for a friend to use.

ALSO PLEASE SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE BOTTOM TO READ SOME EASY LEVELING TIPS AND MAKIGN MONEY IN GAME\nNow anyone who sees this game would easily say that this is a watered-down version of FF14,  however  , I beg to differ.\nEcho of Soul (EOS) is a game that targets to make its own take on things. Beautiful worlds, great mechanics/ animations, and hours of addicting fun. The game is quite difficult proving that there are no healing roles whatsoever, so keeping a watch on your health bar is an absolute must. This game isn't so hard in the leveling process, as grinding is not really required. You don't rake up xp as much as you do grinding helpless creeps for hours but rather doing quests in a timely manner. This was done in order to make the player feel rewarded for their quests and accomplished for doing something to progress the game.  seriously though, do the quests\n\nNO PAY TO WIN This game doesnt require pay to win at all. It was setup so that the player gets often rewarded for leveling up, questing, earning achievements,a nd also winning in pvp matches and gamemodes. The store only offers "outfits" that are costumes for your characters and you can wear on them. These outfits have no effect but change only the outer appearance of what your character is wearing. All the armor can be found in game :)\n\nROLES/GAME The roles/classes each have their own unique abilities and feel to playing that you can easily tell each other apart. However, each class has 2 specific paths in which you can take in order to level your skills, giving the player the freedom to play how they want when they want.\nSpeaking of which, there are jewels that players can "inlay" into their equipment that give mighty buffs. Combining these jewels, if you have more than one, will boost the effects given to that jewel if it will be laid into the  specific piece of equipment.  confusing i know, but its easy to understand when you see\nIn terms of  freedom  the roles are gender locked, so you cant be a body-building girl warriror  sad i know.\n\nDUNGEON/PVP This has a great dungeon and pvp aspect in the game that give both high risk and reward. If in any case you may die in a dungeon or in the world you would face a durability loss on equipment and would have to repair. PVP is different however in which you can die however many times you want and get either a consolation prize or a victory prize after the match. This has smart matching so you can do wahetevr you want while you wait.\n\nNow for the tips\nI cant stress this enough but just enjoy all the game for what it is. For easy levling do the daily quests for the pvp. You need to play 2 games (win or loss) and there. You get basically a level and lots of money. Money is a bit difficult to aqcuire in the game, but is super easy to buy and sell as everything, and i mean EVERYTHING is 1 silver. (excluding all the rare stuff).\n\nFrom completing the pvp you get either a consoloation jewelery box or a victory jewelery box depending if you lost or won. After open and i suggest you save those jewels to create greater ranking jewels. Selling a +5 dull ruby on the marketplace you can make an easy 75 gold.\n\nI think those are good odds considering that 1,000 silver make 1 gold LOL\n\nAll in all, a great game worth playing. Enjoy!","August 21, 2015","true","42.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I decided i like it and wanted to purchase a mount and some new bags. First mistake i made was wanted to purchase anything in this game.\n\nOne you can supposely only purchase one item at a time during your first time purchase from them. Ok i can take that no problem right. So i say "ok, i go ahead and try to at least purchase the mount".\n\nI do transaction and it goes through and i receive a e-mail confirmations how sweet. I was still online with my game on. So thinking i dont see anything added to the game. Then i thinking like most game you must log then relog back in to see the results.\n\nTheir hence comes the problem i get locked out of my account cant play or reach them. I try to reach their customer service but cant since my account is now block. Which means your password wont work to reach them.\n\nI have never ever gone through this purchasing items in any game i played and i played a ton.\n\nI have purchased most my games from steam. I feel steam should remove games from this game company. They obviously don't know how to run a company or out to steal from steam customers.\n\nIf you are already playing this game "Be very warned do not purchase anything from this company."\n\nI have made contact with the support team. I like to thank them for quick response they have reactivated my account. I did receive the ap points i bought. I bought the item's i wanted and now playing with them.\n\nI had about giving up on this game and company. But thier quick action has shown me the do care about their players and will try to fix your problems if you patient enough.\n\nI do like the game and hope others do play it. I just wanted to let other players known not to fear buying items and getting temp ban.\n\nIf it does happen dont worry send in a ticket and it will be fix they will just have you send in a new password and then log in as normal. It took them one day and thats probably cause it was sunday it happen to me.","July 26, 2015","true","51.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AzurZola/recommended/290140/","AzurZola","AzurZola","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AzurZola/","18 products in account","I will catalog this review the best I can to get straight to the point in each topic I feel a person should know before they play this game. Overall I want to focus less on my experience on other MMO's I have played and tell you why I continue to play this one.\n\n1)Leveling-So as I said in my very brief Intro, I am going to get straight to the point and not fluff anything. Somethings about this game could be better, but most things work very well as are, and "If its not broken dont fix it". Leveling in this game is hands down my least fave part of playing. I have 3 level 60 characters(Max Level) and I havn't enjoyed leveling a single one. I still love this game and heres why. This games content is tailored to level 60 characters, and leveling is a very repetative yet still fairly easy process if you just quest. Quest over and over. Doing battlefields will give you experience to level but only will make you level faster than questing if you have close to a 70% win rate. I say rush to max level as fast as you can.\n\n2)Guilds-Many players have a different opinion on who to make friends with (or not make friends with) and why. For many players they join a guild because it's mainly there nationality(Brazil Im talking to you). There are many guilds to choose from, and many guilds choose to fight monsters while many choose to fight players. I prefer to fight players so I picked a pvp guild and I still get to do just as many raids or dungeons as I would have had I not picked a pvp guild. Choose one early in the game to ask questions and make friends. Being in a guild is very rewarding and often helps you learn things the easy way rather than playing the game "in the dark".\n\n3)Gold becomes a thing of desire once you hit level 60. Gold is not needed in any way before level 60 if its your first character. If its your second character or later it can help you to get better gems which make leveling faster, but the game drops enough of them naturally you wont need to worry about it your first run through. Gold is your vehicle to get what you desire. EVERYTHING in this game that effects combat can be purchased with gold. You will have the fastest access to making gold in level 60 raids and dungeons. Or buy and sell goods on the market place if you study it before hand.\n\n4)Gems-Gems are extra items that attach to a players gear to make a player stronger(extra stats). They are a very important part of the game, but often highly over glorified. As a player with 3 level 60's I often play in pvp "gemless" and still compete just fine for MVP. This game isn't that hard if you always are trying to learn what you can do better in a given situation. Gems are luxury!!! Now dont ignore them 100%, they can be a great way to make gold, and a great investment into becoming a stronger player. Far too many players blame their gems as the reason they are losing, when more importantly people with very good gems MOST of the time have better gems because they are better players, although I have beaten many players in flat 1v1 situations having worse gems. I have average gems because i refuse to spend money on this game. Hear that? Never spent a single penny.\n\n5)Dungeons-Dungeons before level 60 are very important and let me tell you what to do and what not to do. Before level 60 do the dungeons just to learn the in game mechanics on bosses, becuase the dungeons you see before level 60(or the bosses) you WILL see again. Focus more on improving as a player in dungeons, than the gear. Going through the same dungeon before level 60 is a flat waste of time once you learn the mechanics. Yes it will give you good gear, but I argue your gear would be better if you spend that same time questing into higher levels over farming a dungeon. NOW AT LEVEL 60, the dungeons are good for gear, and will start to bring a lot of gold. They drop gems and become a true test to your understanding of the game. Do not be upset if people lose their tempers with you in a level 60 dungeon. A lot of players are so used to the dungeons you may be new too, that they dont understand why you are still learning the bosses. My best peice of advise, let good friends or guild members take you to your first lv 60 dungeons to help you grow.\n\n6)Events-Now this game like many MMO's has holiday events. The events in this game so far are more community builders than actual content events, although some events still bring exciting content into view. I argue this is something that Echo of Soul needs more focus on(Maybe through studying World of Warcraft events) But the EOS team has shown willingness to make this a larger part of the game, and i think much more is to come.\n\n7)Reward Drops-Hands Down my least fave part of this game. Most items in this game are worth 1 silver to sell to a vendor. Yes, 1 silver.... Now, I will not focus on that, as much as what Im about to tell you. There is no world rare drop system as in other very fun MMO's. This is something I hope very dearly will enter this game. We need to be able to go into a raid with our friends or guild hoping to get a SPECIAL MOUNT or special item that is ONLY available in that spot. Just by creating a system where some high value items drop very rarely, it creates a passion for players and a great enjoyment. A strong rare drop system allows people to actually feel rewarded for their time OUTSIDE of the personal satisfaction of completing a challenge. I love being challenged as much as the next person, but when you already know you are smart enough to figure them out eventually, a rare drop system keeps it very entertaining and exciting.\n\n8)Battleground-I have covered this a small amount already. Overall its just another way to test yourself. If you find yourself blaming your gems because you die, or your weak gear, it has partial truth. As a player who has been in a new players shoes, I still owned the noobs. Some people can mentally handle the learning curve that will come your way, and many run to excuses. Do the best you can and have fun! Try to learn and enjoy. There is 2 battlefields(3rd if you count Valhalla aka-guild war). Dont make excuses, if you arnt doing well ask others how they play your class in pvp.\n\n9)PAY TO WIN?-FLAT ANSWER NO! This game is 100% NOT PAY TO WIN. You may ask me why I feel that way, well heres point number 1, I have spent not a single amount of any type of real life currency on this game. I still can get beat, but as an experienced player of this game, I find when i get beat it was a result of my own failure of knowledge. Some players are going to be stronger than you, maybe their class "counters" your class. Yes crazy idea I know. When you see a situation like this in battle its best to not fight the 1v1 you think you will lose. I know many good players who wont win a lot of 1v1's. They are viewed as good players because they know when they do and dont have the advantage, and sometimes having your team with greater numbers is what it takes. Dont listen to anyone who says this game is Pay to Win, its a scapegoat and quite frankly, very poor excuse. This game can make your growth faster if you choose to pay, but with that still comes a lot of risk. I know a lot of people who have spent money and not gotten any stronger for it. Think outside of the box and learn the game and the answers will come to you.\n\n10)Last Thought-I find this game to be the closest video game to a much loved anime called SAO. Now that has nothing to do with my love of this game. I personally enjoy testing myself, which this game helps me do. And i love the vast majority of the community. Players here can be mean just like anywhere else, but I have made friendships and I enjoy the time I spend playing. This game far surpasses the time I could spend watching TV or playing another video game.","December 20, 2015","true","154.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It becomes very annoying to constantly move through those as well. The end game seems to be either pvp arena/battleground or mass spamming the same dungeons within the weeks rotation.

Movement is point and click. The skill system is decently thought out, and is a plus in this game. The combat is pretty fun. You get a mount early on in the game which is nice.\n\nA problem with this game is the game progression. Each map there is a little exit portal at the end. If you are targeted by an enemy you are not allowed to leave that section of the map. So for one are there are like 8 sections that you need to progress through and after you go through a portal there is a super fast mini load. As you progress in the game its mainly kill and collect quests. Through quests you do not need to worry about getting new equipment or potions/scrolls to restore health/mana.\n\nAnother problem is that there are no stores or areas you can buy/sell stuff. All the loot gets accumulated in your inventory and there is nowhere to sell or buy stuff.  This entire time I have been playing there has only been one spot to sell/buy stuff and that was the beginning.\n\nMore problems incoming(O.O)...the classes are race and genderlocked. I do not think there are multiple races but the classes are genderlocked. I chose a gaurdian class and it was locked to be a female.\n\nThis game is not really a game I would continuously play. What stopped me from playing more is that there are no towns/merchants to sell my loot. So I have to pick and choose what to keep in my inventory.","April 24","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The graphics quality and framerate are both pretty low. The game also becomes pretty tedious due to its non-engaging story line. Basically you run around looking for a quest, kill a monster, turn it in, and repeat.  My largest complaint with this game is the movement system. Your viewpoint does not change when you turn left or right making you have to manually do it with your mouse. Also, you can't do this while you're walking or it will just go back to your previous viewpoint when you release your mouse. This makes gameplay pretty annoying.\n\nIt's free to play though, so there's no harm in checking it out for yourself if you really want to.","June 23, 2015","false","0.8"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

The reasons why are as follows:\n1. You cannot live up to your own promises regarding your "Advanced" Character customization. Especially when you gender lock classes and you are too lazy to do hair physics for the majority of the 11 hairstyles you have available.\n2. Peers have informed me that this game contains little to no worthwhile content before level 60.\n\nFor anyone looking for something that might be worth your time, try Arche Age. It might have flaws such as bugs and the economy (and of course the dreaded housing system) plus the quite obvious pay2win aspects including secondary currency and Patron status. But even then, the gameplay is dynamic and the classes are more versatile than any other game I've played. The Character customization is also absolutely STUNNING. It is very very well done with a PLETHORA of different options.\n\nEither way, this game is boring and not worth the space on my Harddrive. I reccomend looking somewhere else if you wanted a good MMORPG.","August 8, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","3"

There are only a couple of quests at a time, only a few jobs/ hobbies available and you cannot customise your character that much in the form of choosing specific traits to improve like agility or critical strike chance etc. when you level up.\nAlso the matchmaking in PvP isa disaster because there are no level tiers and you can join a PvP match of mostly level 50s while you're only level 15.\n\nIt may seem that I dislike this game, but I listed the only 2 bad things I have noticed so far while I find everything else quite enjoyable.","July 16, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yuichka/recommended/290140/","Yuichka","Deus Vult ✠","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yuichka/","91 products in account","Good game, no tedious quests, because the main part of the game is party dungeoing and pvping, guild worldpvp and raids which have pvp features!\n\nIt's fun so far, sure there are a few cons. One of them is matchmaking on PvP. You can go PvP from level 10! But, be ready to go against 10-55 players. Which means that the team that has most low leved people will loose!\nBecause at lower levels in PvP you have less skills and less damage.\n\nWish it could go like 10-15, 16-21, 22-26 etc etc, but nah, it's all together and it makes really tedious times in PvP, lazy high level players do much less than low leveled players, which is pathetic. So your only hope is leveling up and have fun in PvP and higher levels!\n\nYou still can be useful in PvP at early levels but 50% of what a high lvl can do, example is that you cannot 1v1 a lvl 25+ as lvl 15. Unless they have half their hp off. :)\n\nOverall i reccomend this game, hopefully they will add more options to matchmaking but questing wasn't tiring and im looking forward to the dungeons and pvp raids. It's still fresh and has a way to go.\n\nDon't listen to most of the reviews as they complain about the game being from AeriaGames, don't get me wrong, I don't like AeriaGames either but it has the best monitization system from AeriaGames. Nothing is P2W so far. And hope it stays that way. It doesn't take long to level to 60 casually.\n\nBe aware, it's like any other mmo out there, there is NO mmorpg that can feel as refreshing as your first ever mmorpg game, if it catches your attention for a while, good. If not, there's nothing to complain about because every mmorpg has done things everyone else did. :)\n\nHave fun playing.\n\nEU - Yggdrasil, Normie.","June 25, 2015","true","38.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I am currently 6/8  109 pvp items which currently makes the the best geared pvp sorc on any server outside of asia. I love this games pvp. But there is just not much to it. 2 battlegrounds and an arena system. My team got up to 1700 team rating and would spend hours in que just to get 1 match in becuase the developers didnt know how to set up a competent arena mmr system. The PVE is okay but nothing groundbreaking and there is not much to it at the moment. The serious lack of content has unfortunately caused me to steer people away from this game. I may change my stance if the next pvp patch greatly improves the state of things but I am not holding my breath. I currently have about 150 hours into skyforge and am loving the game so far.

Something you don't see from Aeria, it's crazy! The game is litteraly not as P2W as it used to and the game feels so much better. Though the game is gender locked, that shouldn't be the issue why your not playing Echo Of Soul, the game is fun both solo or with groups while doing dungeons and raids.  I haven't tried the PVP but i heard it's bad, though everyone has their own opinons and i will be trying myself to see if it is actually good or bad.\n\nTo be honest, i hated it because others did but when i tried it myself i fell in love.  Just a tip, you should always try a game for yourself and don't hate a game just because others hate it, and that goes the same for liking a game, don't like it because others like it you don't have to if you don't want to.\n\nEcho Of Soul is a fun MMORPG for beginners and veterans alike though some fetch quest and genderlock is included, bypassing that it's a decent MMORPG you should try out! ^-^\n\n(I won't be giving a number rating on this game, mostly because i feel everyone game doesn't deserve to be determined as good or bad by a few numbers.)","July 1, 2015","true","6.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The Warrior is straight up Garen from League of Legends, for instance. The sorceress is an Elin from TERA (which is dangerous, since the game already has TERA-style graphics), etc.\n\nIn the hour plus that I've played so far, I have literally not seen another player speak - ONLY gold sellers.\nThe tutorial isn't so much a "Here's a crafted situation, not utilize X mechanic to learn it," and is actually just "You've hit the play button, here are all the mechanics up front. Go forth and die."\n\nNow, some of the mechanics are cool, but it's basically all been done before.\nWhich means you can play this game without devoting yourself to yet another F2P P2W MMO by simply opting to instead play an MMO like RIFT or something.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the game looks kind of nice, but you won't find anything really unique or special here.\nI will play for a few more hours to check up on content farther in and promise to edit this review should anything really warrant it, but from what I've seen of beta and now actual time in-game, I wouldn't recommend this.

I'm so disapointed when mmos that seem good are like this. Warning to those who'd like to play it.\n\n\nI can't see it as a "best MMO" if it has genderlock, ever since I started playing mmo's in the early 2000 I've enjoyed countless good mmo's without having an arbitrary pointless restriction on class gender. It really ruins the experience for a lot of people when an mmo restricts what gender one can play with a clas. And this one takes it even further by restricting the type of person you can be, for example, you can only be a burly warrior, not a lean one, or a sexualized little girl and not a tall young adult woman.\n\nI do accept a game in which one race has one genderlock on a class for lore purposes, but the way this game does it just makes it worse for a lot of people and diversity without improving ANYTHING.","June 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 25 of 79 people (32%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","32","25","79","3","7"

Although the combat is monotonous, the community is amazing. There is no better experience than finding 3 or 4 players of your level and getting to know them while you quewst through the multitudes of areas. People say that the mini area idea with portals between each area is annoying or broken, but they're just being butthurt. I myself never had a problem with it. I usually play the rogue class, and I would say it's the most diifficult, (I've tried all 5) due to the fact that you need to learn combos to be able to do any real damage. Add to that the graphics are pretty good and the paying elements really don't affect you if you get them or not, and you have an amazing MMO all around.","November 25, 2015","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Went into task manager and force ended launcher, launched it agan and got lunch. Came back and launcher was up. Launcher said was loading patch, I opened warowl's livesteam, took 20 mins to load patch. When I created an account an error about the custom browser came up everytime it changed(more of an annoyance).\n\nGame loaded fine, Loaded in windowed mode which was nice. only 1 server and it's not that active. Logged into server and created a character, laggy while switching between characters. The classes are gender AND race locked. This I was confused about but it is a new game so whatever. Created my character, There is no bald hairdo(why????) and very limited to the creation. I know the games creation doesn't matter but some people care about it. Especially hardcore MMO players do. Also the character naming doesn't allow spaces or periods.\n\nLoaded character, the opening clip was pretty good. After it ended the first thing I see if login rewards, this is nice. Movement feels like WoW or Swtor, which is hold right click then attack with number keys only. Combat is a big sluggish but I am playing a rogue so it is a given. The UI is a bit in your face which is slightly annoying. The minimap could be smaller aswell as the toobar.\n\nCombat like i said is sluggish, after playing for about 20 minutes i've gotten a bit used to it but it is still hard to get used to. playing some more and I can see myself playing this longer if I could get used to the combat.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nPros:\n\nCombat system is very much like other popular MMOS but the abilites are strange for me.\nDoes not require a very powerful PC to run.\nClasses are straight forward.\nSmall game download.\nDaily rewards.\n\nCons:\n\nCharacter creation is VERY limited.\nThe ingame tutorial does not help very much.\nOnly 1 server.\nVery much like Tera.\nUI is too big.\n\nIf you are a casual MMO player this game would be fun, If you play many MMOS and are competitive in them. I would wait atleast a year to get into it. The game lacks many competitive scenarios and it was only released a few months ago on steam. I give it a 7/10.","November 30, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A guild member spent 180 pouches (equal to $160.20 USD) on once piece of gear and still didn't get the stats he wanted.

The PvP system is ok and the PvE is pretty good. The PvP system could be less random on the gameplay but all players are close to equally balanced when it comes to  fighting a lvl 60 with a lvl 15 though perks of gear and etc. give major boosts to those who can't access them but I suppose thats the point of that aspect. The PvE needs a little more action for mobs to fight back rather then a simple AI. It should be more complex I think as they are easily overpowered at low levels. BUT the big reason why I enjoy this game is because its not only an MMORPG but its diffrent from ones that I've played.\n","September 8, 2015","true","260.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So if you haven't watched any videos on the game play.. its a quest fest until lvl 60. And theres just too many inconvencies in the game such as not enough bag space and a major FLAW.. why does the game lag so much so often. It even says on the server status whilst logging in that the server is uncrowded. Yes its probably not a deal breaker but it has made my game play less enjoyable and is one of the reasonings I'm quitting. Anyway just going to make a list of sorts now..\nPros -\nPvP is somewhat fun\nMost items such as consumeables can be purchased for cheap in shops until lvl 60\n\nCons -\nWay too much lag for a renowned company such as Aeria\nQuest fest to the tee\nCharacters are gender locked...\nNo fun content until lvl 60 (admittely I haven't even tried any of the content after 60)\nWay too much inconviences such as storage space\n\nOverall.. Id probably give this game a 3/10. Honestly though even though the game isn't P2W since you can get enough gold.. It sure gives off that feel considering its Aeria games and they are a money grubbing company to the tee.","August 17, 2015","false","210.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although the combat is monotonous, the community is amazing. There is no better experience than finding 3 or 4 players of your level and getting to know them while you quewst through the multitudes of areas. People say that the mini area idea with portals between each area is annoying or broken, but they're just being butthurt. I myself never had a problem with it. I usually play the rogue class, and I would say it's the most diifficult, (I've tried all 5) due to the fact that you need to learn combos to be able to do any real damage. Add to that the graphics are pretty good and the paying elements really don't affect you if you get them or not, and you have an amazing MMO all around.","November 25, 2015","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before you are even a few hours into the game there are already quests that require cash shop only items, quests are optional but it's never a good sign. PVP they do a decent job balancing the system which many other games fail to achieve. On the flip side they really lack some basic combat mechanics such as stun immunities (most games in the past 15 years have figured this out) which hinder smooth game play and detract from the positive things they have done with the PVP system.

So if you haven't watched any videos on the game play.. its a quest fest until lvl 60. And theres just too many inconvencies in the game such as not enough bag space and a major FLAW.. why does the game lag so much so often. It even says on the server status whilst logging in that the server is uncrowded. Yes its probably not a deal breaker but it has made my game play less enjoyable and is one of the reasonings I'm quitting. Anyway just going to make a list of sorts now..\nPros -\nPvP is somewhat fun\nMost items such as consumeables can be purchased for cheap in shops until lvl 60\n\nCons -\nWay too much lag for a renowned company such as Aeria\nQuest fest to the tee\nCharacters are gender locked...\nNo fun content until lvl 60 (admittely I haven't even tried any of the content after 60)\nWay too much inconviences such as storage space\n\nOverall.. Id probably give this game a 3/10. Honestly though even though the game isn't P2W since you can get enough gold.. It sure gives off that feel considering its Aeria games and they are a money grubbing company to the tee.","August 17, 2015","false","210.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Went into task manager and force ended launcher, launched it agan and got lunch. Came back and launcher was up. Launcher said was loading patch, I opened warowl's livesteam, took 20 mins to load patch. When I created an account an error about the custom browser came up everytime it changed(more of an annoyance).\n\nGame loaded fine, Loaded in windowed mode which was nice. only 1 server and it's not that active. Logged into server and created a character, laggy while switching between characters. The classes are gender AND race locked. This I was confused about but it is a new game so whatever. Created my character, There is no bald hairdo(why????) and very limited to the creation. I know the games creation doesn't matter but some people care about it. Especially hardcore MMO players do. Also the character naming doesn't allow spaces or periods.\n\nLoaded character, the opening clip was pretty good. After it ended the first thing I see if login rewards, this is nice. Movement feels like WoW or Swtor, which is hold right click then attack with number keys only. Combat is a big sluggish but I am playing a rogue so it is a given. The UI is a bit in your face which is slightly annoying. The minimap could be smaller aswell as the toobar.\n\nCombat like i said is sluggish, after playing for about 20 minutes i've gotten a bit used to it but it is still hard to get used to. playing some more and I can see myself playing this longer if I could get used to the combat.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nPros:\n\nCombat system is very much like other popular MMOS but the abilites are strange for me.\nDoes not require a very powerful PC to run.\nClasses are straight forward.\nSmall game download.\nDaily rewards.\n\nCons:\n\nCharacter creation is VERY limited.\nThe ingame tutorial does not help very much.\nOnly 1 server.\nVery much like Tera.\nUI is too big.\n\nIf you are a casual MMO player this game would be fun, If you play many MMOS and are competitive in them. I would wait atleast a year to get into it. The game lacks many competitive scenarios and it was only released a few months ago on steam. I give it a 7/10.","November 30, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is still very active and I saw many new players in the first few areas. I leveled up to 20 with my groupmates this morning and we made a guild together. Everyone I encountered in game was very kind and helpful.\n\nThe game seems EXTREMELY well polished, especially for a F2P game. I had low expectations after watching reviews of EOS on MMOs.com and MMOHUT and I was pleasently suprised to find it an allaround  better experiance than many other similar games I have played. (Neverwinter, Perfect World, BnS, STO, Path of Exile to name a few)\n\nThis is a great title and really returns to that "classic" MMORPG feel, but with very nice combat, animations, and decent graphics.\n\nOf course it playes like many other MMOS (Go here, kill this, repeat) but is a VERY enjoyable experiance especially with a group.\n\nThe classes are gender-locked, probably to save time in development. I don't personally mind this but other players who absolutely refuse to play as the opposite gender might dislike this feature. So far I am enjoying playing as the Guardian class.\n\nOverall I would give this game an 8/10.\nIf you are looking for a revoluionary game with the latest trendy features this is not the one for you. However, if you just want a good all around MMO that ticks all the usual boxes with a few unique features, decent graphics (works on many systems) and fun all around gameplay this is a great choice","May 30","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
