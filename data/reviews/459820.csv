"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keirnoth/recommended/459820/","Keirnoth","Iie-Kyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keirnoth/","1246 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCross between HuniePop and Cookie Clicker.  Best waifus everywhere and very reasonably paced.  The writing is very HuniePop-ish - it's corny, it's cheesy, and it refers to modern dank memes, but somehow it doesn't feel cringe-inducing because the whole thing is just over the top.\n\nYou know that weak-willed male protagonist in harem anime that always seem to screw something up?  You're kinda like that - you end up meeting new best waifus by messing things up, whether it's telling a big-chested narcoleptic girl that there is no spoon, to wrecking a biker girl's ride, or REKT-ing a female gamer's high score at the arcade.  Then it's a mission to atone for your mistakes and convince the girl that you're not a failure.\n\nYou do that by improving yourself - getting all sorts of jobs to earn money and training your skills and personality up to get the waifus to like you more.  Yes, unlike the loser male protagonist in harem anime, you become a better person by actually doing something about how much of a loser you are!  With that money, you can buy your potential waifus gifts and take them out on dates, pulling yourself out of the adversarial zone.  Heck, the game even has you in the "friendzone" for a little while.  It's almost like these people know what it's like to be a dork!\n\nAnyway, most of it is tongue in cheek.  The girls are cutely drawn - colors are a bit more flat and pastel-ish than HuniePop.  Looks like they were drawn by a Western artist trying to emulate the Japanese anime style, but it works very well considering how the girls act.  The chats are funny and corny and game is paced pretty well for an idle clicker.  You don't run into "wait" stretches like you do with games like Clicker Heroes and Adventure Capitalist.  You click your jobs and money and affection up, but you can also use the in-game currency, called diamonds, to buy time boosts and/or additional time clocks.  Time clocks are essential to the game - they determine how many skills and jobs you can do.  You gain these slowly but you can purchase additional time clocks to do more things at once.\n\nGame also has prestige, letting you reset your game to speed things up.  Time clock upgrades you bought with said diamonds are kept so nothing to worry about there.\n\nOverall, it's "yet another" idle clicker, but it's an idle clicker with a LOT of personality and it feels very well polished.  Compare this to a competing waifu idle clicker, Sakura Clicker, which felt half-finished and lacking when it first came out.  This is an early access game and it feels very much complete!  Well done Sad Panda Studios, you learned from the mistakes of other devs.  I hope this game does well!","May 28","true","6.1"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","32","34","7","0"

Its beautifully crafted, and a lot of fun.\nHowever, if you intend to play this game fully, be ready to do one of three things: Cheat, Pay, or Both. I\'m the type who prefers to do none of the above (I\'ll spend a little money on a good Free To Play, but this game will require you to pay out the nose to get anywhere.). After calculating it out, it would take well over 30 years to put a dent in finishing this game. The game lulls you in with a few easy girls in the beginning, but once you get past Fumi, you begin to understand exactly what this game is calling for. Your wait time starts going up by weeks, months, then years -- Sure you can prestige, or pay, but exactly how much are you willing to do so as the wait time starts going into the thousand day margin? Overall, lovely and fun, but if you intend to play, my best advice to you is to not put your heart into it.","May 31","false","91.7"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","48","61","0","0"

I can see some negative reviews coming in because people don't understand the genre. With that being said, I expect people to develop a CRUSH on Crush Crush after playing it. This is like the clicking/idle game of HuniePop. It's refreshing to finally have a game that is comparable to HuniePop after the last release of HunieCam Studio fell so short.\n\nPositive:+ Achievements\n+ Price (FREE!)\n+ Diversity: lots of jobs, hobbies, girls\n+ Graphics: each girl has their own style, overall very aesthetic\n+ Dating sim combined with a clicker adds a spin to the genre and hopefully more games develop from this\n+ Cool stats screen where your character changes, which is subtle\n+ Developers realized that this is a good game to make free and for people who want more, there are micro-transactions. I think a lot of games recently overprice their games.\n+ If you actually read the dialog, some of it is super hilarious, well done devs, well done\n\nNegatives:- No Steam Trading Cards\n- No Voice Acting\n- Not Enough Picture Content\n- More Dialog would be fun\n- More avatar items would be fun\n\nVery Good Game: 8/10\n\nWhat's not to recommend about a really good free game? Definitely recommend! I can't wait to see the game out of early access. The scores I give games are based on the genre they are in and not an overall score like you would see in metacritic. This game is one of the best in the clicking/idling genre.","May 14","true","7.1"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","35","41","5","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/recommended/459820/","SkyeF","Flutter Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/","413 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've played tons of Clicker games, and Crush Crush is definitely beating them all and is my favorite, here's why:\nIn all of these other games, all you do is click, click, click... And buy upgrades. And then eventually the whole game plays itself for you, and all you have to do is buy upgrades and reset the game for the prestige bonus. They're all the same.\nNow, here's why I like Crush Crush: This game actually has a personality to it. All the girls in the game have a different personality, they make funny jokes, and they're cute as well, without needing to go the way the Sakura games go, this game is adorable, and family friendly for everyone.\nNow let me explain how this game works; You date the girls, and you go further in your relationship by doing various requirements in the Affection Metter, such as going with them on dates to certain places, buying them specific gifts, being better in a hobby/ job and also the clicker part: Affection Hearts. Affection Hearts will always be a requirement to the next level in a relationship, and you can get these in a few ways: Clicking on the girl, buying the girl a gift, or going on a date with the girl. Gifts and dates each give a different amount of Affection Hearts, the more expensive the gift/date is, the more hearts you get. So if you don't like clicking, you can not do that at all, and just buy things instead (the game could not be considered a clicker game because of that as well).\nYou earn money by doing jobs, and you unlock new jobs by becoming better in a hobby. Both of these require Time Blocks. Time Blocks are basically your "time" For example, you have 6 time blocks, and working at the restaurant costs 3 Time blocks, and improving your hobby in dancing also costs 3. You can spend them on both, and be left without time blocks, but time blocks are infinite use, so if you need more time blocks, you can just stop one of your jobs or stop one of your hobbies, and your time blocks will be free to use again. Pretty great system in my opinion, as well as allows you to focus on what you want. You get more of them by going higher in a relationship with a girl, as well as for getting 4 achievements each time.\nThe game is completely free to play, it has however microtransactions for gems which can be used to speed up your game progress, or get more time blocks, HOWEVER, you can do all of that completely normally by playing the game, as well as there being a reset system in the game, which allows you to speed up your game progress too. In other words, gems are completely unnecessary, and you can do everything by just playing the game normally. (You do get gems by just playing the game as well, so you can collect them up and buy something from the store if you want for free).\n\nThat's pretty much it. The game is cute, family friendly, free, has mechanics which make it a lot more interesting than other "clicker" games, and in general is pretty well done. I might as well mention that the developer is really nice, and they're listening to feedback and improving the game constantly.\n\nI recomment it completely, it's a lot of fun.","May 17","true","26.3"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","31","36","0","2"

Apparently my brain is a skinner-box factory. (Google it). It's effectively a Dating Sim with part clicker and part idle.\n\nI hesitate to call it an idle game now because recent updates have made it so that you can be very active throughout your various resets and prestige levels, and I feel it could earn its place in the "Time Management" genre. In your early-to-midgame you have to balance your "time blocks" between hobbies and jobs in order to earn money to give your girls gifts - The fastest way to give them crystalline hearts, which acts as their progression. While doing all of this you earn a multiplier, which makes every activity faster. Everything, even the Flirt button and gift giving.\n\nCC is a very easy game to learn and get into. Recent updates have helped this immensily but I will say that late-game brings in the Idle tag into full force when you have to wait for your hobbies for hours at a time. The in-game microtransactions are optional but helpful, and is not a new mechanic to these games.\n\nAnother small tidbit that I can appreciate: Changing your gender is a simple click of the button which has a lovely implication that I find inclusive and lovely. Now all someone needs to do is do the same for some kind of "Hunk Sim" and the road to shallow equality will be complete!\n\nIt's free to play so there's no real excuse not to try it out!","May 17","true","17.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","16","17","2","0"

First thing there no any naked girl in this game, so don't complain or go for nudity. I would suggest you to play this game, although it's absolutely free. This is one of those 'clicker' games essentially, but this time you have to attempt to pull girls with your ability to press your mouse at the speed of light. You start off as enemies of some sort, then have to work your way up until you become girlfriends by completing repetitive tasks. It's like 700 MB's, which isn't even that much in today's standards, but if you wanna try out something new in the Clicker genre, then sure why not?

Up to a certain point, there is no more possible progression, simple as that.\n\nThe devs justify the insurmountable wall by claiming that by adding new girls, the prestige cap will be raised, thus making everything go faster. Though true, this is completely nullified in the end because the devs end up increasing the time requirements as well as the progression conditions.\n\nI'll restate a beautiful point brought up by someone during my time back at Kongregate:\n\n"At this point in time for me, and I'm sure with many others, there is nothing left to do but wait... I'm not sure how many consecutive days I can open this, realize nothing can be done and shut it down. eventually I'm just going to hit the point where opening the game is more hassle than its worth and then you are going to lose players."\n\nThis was posted 2 months ago (aka 4 girls, 3 patches, and pre steam release ago) and is still entirely valid today.\n\nYes you can have fun for a month or so.

It was only a matter of minutes before I was proven wrong. This game is brilliant. There's a lot more depth to it then I would have expected from an idle game dating simulator and holy crap does it ever have me hooked. Each girl is incredibly different from the last, they all have completely different quotes, personalities and difficulties. Some of the quotes are absolutely brilliant, I'm not going to spoil any of them but the references in this game surprised me and made the game a lot better. The dating sim aspect really blends well with the idle gameplay, the flow of the in-game management and progression makes for a very smooth grind. The difficulty grows gradually, though each tier of relationship with each girl is a significant spike from the last. There's a lot to enjoy in this game, so if you're a fan of either dating sims or idle games then this is a 100% must-play, especially since it is free. Plus there are steam achievements *wink*.\n\nTLDR: The game is way more fun than it deserves to be, plus there's hot anime girls.

Source\n\nAnd in the last Update (0.31~2), they reduced the total amount of free Gems by 15%, with the reasoning of Balancing, since they've added a new mechanic which allows you to gain more than 13.75x prestige Multiplier (still capped, 64x), but in the same Move they have Quadrupled the purchasable Multiplier from x256 > x1024.\nSo you have more to buy but less for free, making the Gap between F2P and P2W even wider, how is that balancing?\n\nAs well that the latest Girl takes 2 Gems at a certain point, which wouldn't be so bad, if this Girl would not have an as of this Version Endgameperk, to get her to Lover you need 2 Hobbies at Lvl.60 which is current Max. So while you could still gain +9 Gems from her, this only applies if you can finish her the very first Time you go past that point. To make matters worse, she has 2 of the 2 Gems required to advance States, where she does not take the 2 Gems the first Time, so you can't even be sure if she is not kidding again, if you don't already know that she will take them.\nAnd the thing that you stilll need 10 Gems on Hand for her Lover State, which she also does not take, but having 10 Gems leftover at this point as F2P is kinda unlikly, especially since even when you have the current Maximum Multiplier for Hobbies, x64 Prestige x1024 Cashshop x16 Gilding, it would take ~7 Days to go from 59>60 alone.\n\nAnyway that's my 50cent for now, will keep an Eye out, but at this point, I don't think the Game will recover that much, again sadly, it really had great potential.","May 16","false","41.1"," 33 of 59 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","33","59","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kevin897/recommended/459820/","Kevin897","Kevin_Tama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kevin897/","44 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nIt's exactly what it says on the tin. It's a dating sim and a clicker/idle game. Nothing more nothing less. So let's just get down to it.\n\nPros:\n+ Gameplay, while inherently simple, is fairly interesting with the addition of the dating sim elements, and a time block management. So you need to train up stats and earn money to actually be competent at wooing the girls, instead of just mad clicking skillz (autoclicker). The game also makes it clear that it is only storing your idle activities for up to 7 days. So you can schedule ahead if you're that type of person.\n\n+ Clear requirements for getting the girls. So the game has you wooing the ladies in a couple of "stages", and each stage has very clear requirements, like needing to give her a drink as a gift, or going on two dates with her. It makes progression feel special in its own little way and does just enough to stave off monotony. That said, this system also comes with its own drawbacks.\n\n+ The girls are cute, and the way they get introduced to you can be mildly funny, that said don't expect much from the personality department. They're archetypes and that's that. Their dialogue can also give you a chuckle or two though.\n\n+You can prestige ASAP and the speed boosts from that prestige reset is nothing to sneeze at. Way more generous with this than most clicker games are.\n\n+ It's free and everyone likes free games.\n\nCons:\n- So that drawback with the requirements system? Well, the requirements are gigantic. There is a huge leap in requirements from stage to stage and it gets kind of ridiculous and grindy because of that. I know you can leave the game to idle so that it grinds up stats and money for you, and that's the point, but seeing the numbers go from around 100 to 8000 in one stage transition can be very discouraging. In fact the clicking requirements will get so huge that you probably will need mad clicking skillz (Autoclicker) in the end, or you know you can just leave it for a week and maybe you'll have finished it all.\n\n- Another big problem is that the game will only give you idle clicks on the girls if you fulfill a stats that they like. So girls who like Buff guys will not get idle clicks if your Buff stat isn't up to par. It's never explained in the game so you might miss it and go back to your game after a couple of days expecting a full heart but getting jack all instead. The game also doesn't make how you go about fulfilling these stats requirements. So you don't know if you need to have like 8 Buff or just 3 Buff for the girl to start getting them idle clicks. It does look like that you just need at least 2 or 3 though to get the idle clicks. Which leads to another problem...\n\n- Idle clicks can never be improved. So yeah you have 3 Buff and you get 1 idle click per second for the girl, and that's it. Even if you have 16 Buff you still only get 1 idle click per second. So then what's the point of raising the skills? Well just to meet the stage requirements that's all. That's kinda where the game starts to wilt, when it becomes grindy like that, and it doesn't take too long for it to get to that point. Also, the prices of gifts are ridiculous. Again, huge leaps from item to item, which only makes the grinding waaaay more apparent and tedious.\n\n\nOverall, I do like the game though, and I can recommend this to anyone looking for a lighthearted anime clicker. It can get tedious after a while, but it's one of those games that you can just leave and come back to whenever you feel like it. Its mechanisms work quite well together and there does not seem to be any major bugs or issues from my experiences. It's also still in Early Access, so the game might be improved later through patches and updates, and for an Early Access title, it's very functional. I have not encountered any major bugs or issues so far (which is probably not that far but eh.)\n\nPS: Quill Best Girl","May 16","true","7.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Don't be holdin out on us now. I didn't dedicate 3 years of my life to clicking to not get no action if you know what I'm sayin'!\n\nIf you don't then allow me to explain in excrutiating detail, step by step, with this flowchart and these figures I have assembled together!\n\nI recommend this game but just barely; it confuses me because idle games by the very nature of the name are about idling. You know, not being there? Letting the game play itself with minimal intervention.\n\nSo here we are, a dating simulator that doubles as a idle clicker game that has lots of interactivity to do and GET THIS, it has a clicking cap! Click too much and you will fill that girls quota until you do other things on her check list.\nThings that you can't click to achieve!\nIf I were to rate this as a "game" it would fail so very hard just because of how long everything takes to do but since I am rating it as an idle game, its okay. It does a lot of things these games do but requires too much busy work to be truely idle.\n\nMy suggestions to Sad Panda are this, 1) get nudes in. You know it, I know it, we didn't buy...Download for free, this game just to read the articles.\n2) give us the objectives (leave them as they are) but make it so that we can also click in order to progress a girl. That way as an idle clicker you can click away but if you want to play for the story, then you can do that as well.\n\nI know the latter will break the point of the game or be very hard to impliment but at present it just feels weird, being neither a true idle game nor a true dating sim.\n\nAs for the former, just make it DLC or a downloadable mod. Huniepop did it and they are here on steam so don't worry about it.\n\nAlso 3)More people of color and genders. A bear is fine and all but give us a fem emo wolfboy...Wait that was a different idle game I reviewed...Anyway you get the point, give us more to totally not fap too.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","May 23","true","25.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Not bad for a Early Release Free to play game.  Has Waifus for every taste, to add to your harem.  You are inside a wierd universe that lets you work multiple careers and jobs, juggle dating multiple females, learn multiple hobbies, (WTF: Dating a female BEAR!!), hyper-inflation, while gaining more Time as you level up.  The graphics and sound are ok.  The conversations are funny.

I'll follow the game to see if they reduce the amount of money for gifts, reduce the points needed for level up, or make hobbies take less than a day, week, or month to level.

You start off as enemies of some sort, then have to work your way up until you become girlfriends by completing repetitive tasks.\n\nAre there any naked chicks?\nI've only played 20 minutes of the game, but if there is any naked anime girls, then please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\nSo, the games free to play, are there any sort of microtransactions in game?\nLike most free to play games, yes this game comes in a form of microtransactions called 'diamonds', which can be used to speed up the process of many activities and buy certain items in-game early.\n\n\nOk, we've got past the boring part, what do you actually get to do in this?\nIn order to get with the girls in the game, you'll need to level up things such as 'jobs' and 'hobbies' which allow you to complete a certain amount of objectives to progress with the girl. By clicking the character on the main screen however, you gain 'hearts' which is essentially the 'clicker' part of the game. You can however gain multiple amounts of hearts at the same time via 'chatting' to the girls (essentially a one button press and it gives you +25 hearts etc.) and going on dates. There is a wait time behind doing these though, but they're never usually longer than a few seconds.\n\nIs there still naked women in this game?\nYou've asked this question already. I don't know. Stop asking this question.\n\nWhat's Pi to five decimal places?\n3.14159\n\nIs it worth downloading this game at all?\nIt's like 700 mb, which isn't even that much in today's standards, but if you wanna try out something new in the Clicker genre, then sure why not? If you like anime of any sort then yeah, this is probably up your alley.","May 14","true","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

The first part is a clicky time management game, as you click to talk to the girls and switch between hobbies and jobs. Eventually, though, you'll just be waiting to get enough money or skills to advance. At this point, you either pay real money to advance or just close the program and let the game play itself, as it accumulates money and skills offline, up to 7 days worth. There are some mildy interesting mechanics to speed up the game and avoid this, but they only go so far. Recommended if this type of game appeals to you, but just know what you're getting into. I'll probably finish the game out of compulsion, but I find it more annoying than fun.\n\nMinor improvement suggestion: Don't repeat what the girls say until you've cycled through their list, then just reshuffle the list.

Nice art, likable girls, funny content in places and fun in a lot of the ways that virtual pets were.  You don't sit down and play for an hour (after the first hour, anyway).  You just check in for a few minutes every few hours or so as progress continues even when the game is shut down.  It scratches that management itch pretty well.  And yes.  That rainbow-haired girl in blue is pure brony bait.  Unashamed, at that, which is actually rather nice.  No worries, non-bronies -- if you don't know anything about the fandom then you likely won't even notice the references.\n\nNoteworthy is the bonus/reset feature.  At any time you can reset the game.  It's a sort of new game+ feature in that resetting applies a permanent, stackable muliplier to your progress that affects time-based content.  The more you've done, the higher the multiplier.  The higher the multiplier, the faster things move.  As you retain in-game achievements and certain stats, it's actually tempting to utilize.\n\nFinally, there's a special currency earned by achieving certain milestones.  This currency can be used to purchase a variety of bonuses including -X- hours worth of progress, increases to the multiplier, additional time blocks (the stat that determines how much you can do at once), bonuses to stat gain rates and more.\n\nAlso: a bouquet of flowers is going to cost you more than a private island.  One of the girls wants two of them.  Another wants just over 15 million dollars worth of tequila, which amounts to all of 25 small glasses.  Apparenlty inflation skyrockets like nothing we've ever seen before in the next few years.\n\nEDIT: typos.","May 19","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I'll cut straight to the chase and say why:\n\nThis game is not only fairly original, has good aesthetics, and an overall feel-good and calm-ish sort of tone to it, but it sports some pretty good artwork as well and likeable characters with good designs. It's an amazing blend of the dating sim/idle game genre, and one that makes me feel a sense of accomplishment inside. The pacing at first is phenomenal and begs you to keep playing, but the problem comes from staying on the hype train and noticing that maybe this isn't as good as it was a few prestiges ago.\n\nBut there are definitely problems, noticed mostly with prestiging and the downward spiral it creates. Much like prestiging in an FPS game, it takes pretty much longer and longer for you to get any progress in the game as you go through it, going from a happy skip through a meadow into wading through mud that goes up to your hips. The immense slowdown not only jarred me a bit, but left me only wanting more, and constantly tempts me to spend money on gems just so I can get a sense of euphoria again, but that's exactly what they want me to do, and so I fight against it. The gem shop is also a problem as it basically allows the devs to make huge hurdles for you to cross; which of course you can jump over easily with only a small payment of just about $20+ dollars worth of gems.\n\nEssentially, the game is too enjoyable at first to hate, but too boring later to love, and so I'm basically left with a feeling of neutrality. For now, because of my overall experience, I'm going to give this a recommend, but if the system gets even worse with updates I'll likely change that to a no.\n\nEdit: The only honest way I can see this fixed is by uncapping everything multiplier-wise, and making the hurdles not nearly as large as they are right now.","May 21","true","88.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Boy,how i was WRONG. Crush Crush is actually pretty darn fun, with its unique traits of the girls and other things. The only problem with this game is time. You need LOTS of it if you want to complete the game, which is fairly easy. What gets me is the difficulty and simplicity of the game, hard but not incredibly hard and simple to get you far in the game. The game is a LOT like Huniepop but more appropriate. I do recommend this game to waste your time while having decent fun. :)\n\nP.S. I saw this bad review on how it would take 50 years to complete the game. That is COMPLETELY WRONG.

Crush Crush is a casual game developed by Sad Panda Studios. The game takes the format of a clicker.... but with WAIFUS! You have "crushed" these girls one way or another, and now to make it up to them you must grow friendships and spend a lot of money to get them to forgive and love you.\n\nPros:\n-Better mechanics behind idling than many other idlers I have played. Actually obtainable and not too difficult\n-Characters are something to love in this game. They are cute (yes, Bearverley, I'm talking about you) and their dialogue has made me laugh quite a few times already\n-There is a broad spectrum to this clicker, as you need to focus on leveling up your "hobbies", "jobs" and still be able to click "hearts" to progress\n-The game is free, and it has multiple achievements, most of them with the anime-style characters. Yes.\n-Developers are very active with regards to support and updates. Good to know considering this game is still early-access\n\nCons:\n-Progression at the moment is a bit difficult, and requires some form of microtransaction (buy diamonds) in order for you to progress faster. It is still completely possible to progress without this, it just becomes incredibly slow\n\nIf you are someone who loves themselves a good clicker, combined with beautiful waifus and a touch of humour, this is the perfect game for you.\n8/10","May 22","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In the grand scheme of things, nothing can be gained without first sacrificing something to achieve it. Free samples at a Costco or Sam's Club require a membership to enter the store, a free appetizer requires signing up for a rewards program, free miles with a credit card force you to get a credit card, and free to play games are held back by the ultimate sacrifice of time. Crush Crush is an example of a free to play game burdened with the sacrifice of time as everything needed to progress is held back behind a timer. There is a bit of offhand humor and some charming artwork on display, but the ultimate question relies on how much of a pay off it offers. Does this time sink give a memorable journey into the building of a lovely relationship or simply trick the user into a guesswork of plausible worth?\n\nArt can be a matter of taste for any given individual. The character designs to the backgrounds used for inductions and dates are all rather well drawn with very little out of place distractions. Each scene has their own comedic approach on dates that fit the personality of their respected female and the animations used for hobbies and jobs are a wonderful touch. The music is limited and can get old quickly, but the sound effects are downright grating (especially during the first few relationship levels with the girls when you need to click them to progress.) It shows effort and is pleasing to the eye, which is good considering how long you will be seeing them.\n\nThe madness begins by meeting your first girl and cookie clicking her to the point she forgives you. Each girl has to be wooed through several relationship levels by meeting certain requirements from hearts gained (either by clicking chat, the girl or over time if you have the right hobby leveled) to gifts and dates spent on them. Upon reaching one of the three landmarks, you are rewarded with a picture of the character. Honestly, the reward for sinking so much time into this game is not that great, but it does let you level while not playing.\n\nYou also need to level hobbies and jobs (all over time) to meet certain requirements. Money is generated by the jobs and each time you are paid the job progresses until you are promoted. Hobby levels unlock new jobs and also help unlock new girls to woo. Both have a certain amount of time needed to progress, but you can reset the current game to increase the time multiplier and decrease the amount of time needed to progress. Time blocks are also unlocked when you level up a relationship or job to a certain point which allows you to level more jobs and hobbies at the same time. If it really was this simple, I would have given the game a recommendation for being free and plausible to complete; I then found out the system is rigged.\n\nA free to play game can manage the balance between micro-transactions and time vs reward, but in this case the balance is not achievable. The in-game store uses diamonds (which you are limited to without purchasing them with real money) to increase the speed multiplier, increase time slots for jobs and hobbies and to skip time ahead by 4 hour to 7 days. Right now the multiplier increase from resetting the game is locked at 64x and to increase it further requires real money, which is never mentioned in the game. Time blocks are also limited without using real money and that is never mentioned either. I cannot begin to explain how much time is needed to raise a hobby past 30, let alone 40 and 50 without the use of a multiplier increase. This makes it quite improbable to even reach the eleventh girl's max relationship status (outside the fact you need diamonds to do it) in a reasonable amount of time. This creates a feeling many describe as "time dilemma" (I grew victim to it on Eve Online with the skill injects to erase waiting time for skills to level) that can make people flee to the in-game store to buy diamonds in order to complete the game. It is bad enough this gap exists, but the developer should have disclosed the limitations on their store page.\n\nMicro-transactions will always be a delicate topic in regards to games. I have grown to accept them in free to play games that are not in beta/early access and even MMOs when they offer cosmetic or pet/mount value. This game, however, does not disclose the free to play and pay to win gap it has created using the ultimate payment of time. I actually like the artwork for this game and thought some of the jokes, albeit dated, were chuckle worthy, but this is all pushed to the side when the micro-transactions rear their head. I cannot in good faith recommend this product and plead with the developer to disclose the limitations out of respect to the consumer. I will check back on this product later down the road and hope that my time then will not be put up for auction.\n\nPros\n\n- Artwork and character models\n- Some enjoyable humor and clever characters\n\nCons\n\n- Micro-transactions with undisclosed limitations\n- Sound effects can wear thin after awhile\n- Very little reward for the effort","May 18","false","15.0"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","1"

If you only have a couple minutes, you can still get plenty done and set up so you can do more later!\n\nYou can talk with the girls, buy them gifts, go on dates, or view their stats from their windows, and you unlock more girls as you go. Each girl automatically gains hearts/affection if you have a certain trait (which I believe means you're 'actively' working on a hobby, I could be wrong) so that builds up while you're on or off the game. Gifts are rather expensive, but if you're running two or more jobs at a time, you bank a ton of money quickly, even in the 'easy' jobs. Unlocking higher jobs will net you far more per minute, letting you spend more on the girls.\n\nPros;\nNot at all difficult to understand! Very easy to get in-to.\nEverything is pretty and clean.\nGameplay encourages clicking but doesnt require it to get things done.\nVariety of girls, with cute designs and personalities\nWindowed screen now has a large option and I love getting to see everything clearly!\n\n\nCons;\nCharacter profile for player is rather lacking, but I'm guessing that is in the works?\nOnce you're 'done' levelling up a girl, there's nothing else to do with her.

It's fun, addictive, and challenging. I really love to play this, and it runs very well! There are very few bugs, one is that sometimes when you accept a job for a requirement, you need to exit the game and reload for it to work. I feel that some of the prices of items are extremely outrageous, but with the game collecting money and such offline, it balances out. There are many girls in the game, but you usually get hooked on one of them. It's better to focus on one girl at a time, rather than every single one. For example, Cassie is now my girlfriend while the others are all basically friendzones. (I haven't unlocked everyone yet!) Once again, this is an amazing game.

It's still pretty good though, and as a fan of clicker games in my downtime I will certainly be playing this for awhile.","May 25","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Overall, it's a clicker that lures you in with two things...boobs and achievements.\n\nOn on hand, you have a few (you know which ones I'm omitting) interesting female choices that actually seem to give a damn (which you is pretty much the opposite of how you'll see females act in reality, thus worsening my pre-existing depression) and on the other, you sacrifice everything you have just to have someone care about you.  You get 6 jobs just to keep a girl interested in you, what do you do with the money?  Spend ALL of it on heart points on the girl you're trying to impress.\n\nSo...what's the biggest problem?  It's a free clicker with a store.  What made this eerily recognizable?  Occassionally you'll get diamonds which you use to supposedly make life easier...except it's really tempting you into buying more by sampling.  South Park did an entire episode dedicated to "Freemium" games by using the same exact strategy.  You get a few free things, then it tempts you to "upgrade" with real purchases...no.  Just, no...\n\nOh, but what's worse that than?  I admit that this is my own fault to even get interested in this game, though blame also rests in the whole "freemium" + achievements strategy.  Yes, I enjoy hunting achievements.  But there is only so much I can handle.\n\nIf you want to play this "dating sim" for the obvious reason of cute girls?  Go ahead.  Alternatively, you can just check out the "Screenshots" section and call it a day.  The art's good, but I'm fed up.\n\n\n3/10  Why have clickers not been banned yet?...at least it has good artwork and pop-culture reference dialogue...","May 22","false","15.7"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","48","13","27","11","5"

But then I took a few weeks break from playing it, when I came back it wasn't anywhere on Kongregate anymore! So I searched everywhere on the internet for it, and then I found it on Steam. That brought me to excitment! I know that I don't have much time playing it on Steam since I just now downloaded it, but I played it for weeks on the internet.\n\nPros:\nGood character design.\n\nDecent background music.\n\nBeautiful characters.\n\nGood scenes.\n\nCons:\nNone\n\nFunny\nNever knew it until I saw the Steam trailer of the game, they added a bear with a dress into the game.\n\nEDIT\nThe bear was an April Fools joke.\n\nFull review\nI have played many clicker games in my life and only this one is the best I've come across. The game is about you dating girls, you have to work at jobs, earn money, and get hobbies. The game is very addicting and I recommend this game to everyone!\n\nThe more you play it, the more better it gets (because of the girls).\n\nThe game is in it's early stage right now. So if you don't like it, then wait for the full release. I am very excited for the upcoming updates.\n\nCongratulations Sad Panda Studios for getting this game on Steam!","May 13","true","2.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","2"

I enjoy it for how simple it is and easy to pick up. I would recommend this game for anyone who is bored and needs something to try out but cant commit too much time into. The pros and cons are as follows:\n\nPros:\n-Decent Art, it isn't perfect but still does the game some good\n-Appealing characters (to me that is, not everyone may agree).\n-Reset for longer play\n-Traits/Hearts/Money can be generated while offline.\n-Save files\n-Simple UI\n\nCons:\n-Music can get repetitive...this is easily fixed by muting it and playing your own.\n-Paying gems for saves, hell no. At least the progress is still there though when you check back though.\n-Item prerequisites are kinda crazy, although i can see why since making money isn't too hard after a few resets and days of being offline.\n-Microtransactions being boosters and time skips, honestly it doesn't surprise me these exist but I am patient enough to wait a few days rather than pay for a skip.\n\nIn a nutshell, I give this game a 6/10. It isn't amazing but it is still charming enough for myself to want to check in on it and play it for a little.\n\n\n","May 17","true","8.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It is "Free to Pay", but there are ways to cheat, so that you avoid the need.\n\nIt starts out needing an auto-clicker, but it quickly becomes apparent that nothing but buying love becomes acceptable.  The later girls even outright demand you buy them warehouses full of seashells or roses, then ask what's wrong with you for bringing those things to her, because she's a holographic expy of Hatsune Miku, and can't use them. Even without that demand, "click 53 billion times" is not really feasible. Later girls like the maid also openly wonder at how you're capable of holding down 8 jobs, 6 hobbies, and dating a dozen girls all at once.\n\nIt also features a largely meaningless and symbolic option to play as a female and even "accessorize" your character.  You can only see it in the stats menu you never bother to see unless you go there for the "prestige mode" that resets the game so you can get speed boosts.  (Note: speed boosts are critical, it's mathmatically obviously worth replaying all the progress you have already achieved to redo it with quad speed, at least unless you want to leave the game running for literally millions of years.)\n\nI have to stress that this game is essentially unbeatable in its current state without cheating. You can buy up to 1024 speed multiplier with diamonds (you get one per relation level with a girl, or pay real money for them), but without spending money that only goes up to 16 if you save up nearly every diamond just to spend upon a single 16x. You are also "offered the option" of spending diamonds upon nearly everything instead of the cash you'll be drowning in, or an option to spend diamonds upon time skips that go from 4 hours to a week for dozens of diamonds.  Again, you need to idle for MILLIONS OF YEARS without the mutliplier.\n\nI recommend this mainly because it's free, and enough of the jokes are funny enough to be worth the effort of cheating - I would not reccomend if it required actual pay for progress.","May 18","true","20.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a bit like HuniePop in a way so people who enjoyed that might enjoy this.\n\nPros:\nDecent characters\nIt's fun to play\nThe drawings and game mechanics are not too bad.\n\nCons:\nLong cool down times.\nEverything is expensive\nYou have to use real money if you want more crystals\nGetting affection can be hard at times.\nBe prepared to prestige A LOT\n\n\nIt takes a ridiculous amount of time for cool downs and earning things. I have six hours for a cool down on a hobby currently. Getting affection can be difficult. Unless you have a lot of money on gifts (in the millions money wise) or are patient when it comes to clicking on the characters to gain affection, be prepared to just exit the game and let the affection pile on after eight or ten hours or else you won't make any progress. That is if you have that unlocked. (The only one who doesn't on mine is Quill)\n\nI think the chat/flirt options when you get further along in each character's story should give the player more than just 44 affection. That's too little for characters that need over 100,000 in affection to progress especially when the gifts are so expensive and some of the gifts don't give much affection either.\n\nI would still reccomend it because I had fun for the first hour and still intend on playing it.\n","June 3","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For about the first two hours you have things to do, and then after that it becomes waiting. Eventually you hit a point where all the requirements for the girls are very expensive, and you'll end up waiting 24 hours for one hobby to be leveled enough so you can get a job, and then you have to wait another 24 hours to level up enough in that job. It's much more "idle" than "game."\n\nYou earn diamonds for each new level you unlock with a girl, and you don't re-earn these through prestiges. Earning diamonds is very slow naturally, and eventually you hit a cap because there's no more levels to unlock with the girls. If you want to keep buying speed boosts (and you will) you will eventually have to pay real money.\n\nThis game is obviously clickbait, considering the anime style, dating simulator aspect, and memes, but that doesn't mean it has to be a bad game. Unfortunately, it still falls back on using cutesy things to keep players interested in the late game. I wouldn't recommend this game, but I also don't think it's entirely worth disregarding. I'm going to keep following it and seeing if it gets better with time, since it is early access.\n\nThis review will be hidden under swarms of "i jacked off and saw memes 10/10 simply epic" anyway.","May 23","false","21.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","2","2","0"

And this thing that wants to pass for a game is just about waiting and waiting. I'm a player, I don't want to wait, I want to play! Game designers who makes players wait are really very poor designers and know nothing about game design.\n\nStay away from this like the plague... no wonder it is free to play, no one will pay for such junk, and there are hundreds of game exactly like that on the web already. Poor game design since it is a clone of a clone of a clone. No imagination or creativity at all.

Integrating clicking with time mechanic for jobs and hobbies is really nice and it works out pretty well in the end. However it seems to me that prestige "stops" after a while and I think they should rework the system, maybe that'll be a more pleasurable experience.\n\nAs for bugs, the only one I found is that sometimes one of the girls will not get any hearts for quite a while at the start, despite me running hobbies/jobs for them, especially Quill. But that might be intended (which means clicking Quill near endlessly until she 'works'...). Overall it's a fun time waste until you hit the caps and it starts taking forever for you to get anywhere.\n\nThat is, if you don't pull the trigger with how terrible the writing and most characters are (not the design, the character design ranges from ok to good, and the art is pleasing). Yes please say "gamer swag", "53xy", and have a FUNNY LE BEAR XD in all caps. That's ♥♥♥♥ing great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lugiasplash/recommended/459820/","Lugiasplash","lugiasplash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lugiasplash/","44 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCrush Crush is an idle game themed around dating random girls you accidentally "meet" in unique catastrophic ways.  (Please excuse the pun and subtle spoiler!)\nThe aim of the game is to fill up each girl's affection meter to the "Lovers" stage. To reach the next stage, you have to meet certain requirements and objectives, such as reaching a certain job title in a certain job, reaching a high-enough level in a certain job, buying them certwain gifts and clicking them enough times.\n\nJobs and hobbies take up Time-Slots, which you only have a small supply of, so you can only work at so many jobs and hobbies simultaneously. You can unlock more time slots by reaching the next affection meter stage for a girl and getting achievements.\n\nJobs give you money each time they are completed after a certain amount of real-life time. Your hard-earned cash can be used to spend on gifts and dates for your girls.\nHobbies take up real-life time and Time-Slots, just like Jobs, to level up specific Traits, like Surfing  buffs  levels up your Buff trait.\n\nI love the backgroung soundtrack and the character design, both in art style and personality. However, I am not keen on how hard and slowly you have to grind to fill up each girl's affection meter (then again, I am pretty impatient and don't like waiting to level up in (m)any videogame(s), so maybe the idle game genre just isn't for me) and how rare diamond drops are.\n\nSpeaking of diamonds, Diamonds are the premium currency of this f2p game.

Why? Because it's a lot different from other clicker games.\nIn most clicker games,you need to,at some point,use real cash to buy in-game currency to progress because it takes far too long to get what you need. Not here: you just need to earn achievements and get further with the girls to get extra time blocks,which you need to improve your skills and/or earn money,which you need to buy gifts to progress with the girls to get more time blocks. It's a formula that works really well,and may also explain why it's so fun to interact with the characters in the game (not to mention the copious amounts of in-jokes and references).\n10/10 best free clicker game 2k16","May 18","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can tell that this was designed with phones in mind, as it follows the style of most "freeium" games, where in order to progress, there are many points where you have to wait in real-time. Up to a couple of days in order to raise enough cash or get your skills high enough to meet certain goals. If you are not the type to wait, and have money burning a hole in your pocket, you can pay real money to buy "gems" which can be used to help speed things up. (Money, Time Points, even jump ahead in game time.)\n\nHowever, if you are patient and check back with the game once every day or two, you can slowly complete what is there without having to spend a dime of you hard earned money. (The game is still in early access at time of my review, and more features and girls are listed as "coming soon".)\n\nIf I could rate it from 1 - 10. I would give it a "6.5". It's not ground breaking. The graphics are nice but not mindblowing. The gameplay is minimal. But, somehow, it is strangely addicting if you are completionist like me.","May 21","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Blame Pamu for asking me to write that. (Proof/Spoiler: http://imgur.com/J3B2dWx)\n\nSo I'm uprating this overall, but this game isn't without some HUGE flaws. I'm also not going to lie, I did save edit (sorta) in order to complete this game in a reasonable time, so consider this when reading. In my defense, it is early access.\n\nSo let's be nice here and start off with the pros:\n~Funny story/dialogue: This game mannaged to make me laugh a lot. Cassie is refreshing, and fun to see grow. She's the first character and a good way to say hi to the player.\n~Reference whoring: And not a damn thing wrong with it. It adds greatly to the humor.\n~4th-wall breaking: Happens a lot and add to the comedy.\n~Gameplay: Solid time management/clicker to idle your time to. Nothing groundbreaking though.\n~Pacing early game: Progress seems meaningful and you meet a lot of characters in the first 3 hours of gameplay (without cheating!)\n~Soft reset is meaningful early game.\n~Enjoyable early game.\n~60USD buys all perma buffs and time blocks needed to use everything\n~Fair job system\n\nThis may seem like a small list, but this lead to me wanting to complete this game at first.... but I did say flaws:\n\nCons:\n~Free Gems/Diamonds are capped at 100 (98 after Pamu's had her way with them). There is no chance to earn them by low chance means like most clickers.\n~Diamond shop is broken (time skip will often lag, and clicking the only button you can will charge you x2 to 15x times more than the required amount to unlag it. xing out will charge you and not do anything. This lead to me save editing)\n~Max gifts per transaction is 1000. This sucked late game with the last two characters needing 2000+ (up to 50000)\n~1 job is locked behind a hobby cap.\n~All perma buffs are needed in order to "complete" the game in under a year.\n~Hobby system basically requires you to buy things in order to get the last 5 characters to max before you get bored of the game.\n~1 money achivement will take you 430623 days (give or take a hundered hours) at max paid buff/soft cap buff (That's means a 65536x Speed bost), with all jobs running, to get. number below is 1 day at max speed:\n232221621171478\n\n\nIn short, yes, it's free to play, but most clickers offer a long but rewarding option outside of a paywall in order to "beat" the game or get paid currently infinitly. So play it for a few hours, if you like it, dump 40-60USD on it and you'll finish in under a year without cheating. Hopefully this will be fixed upon release. Have not done Beta yet.\n","May 22","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a move that spoils quite fun game mechanics, making the game ultimately pay to win. I know it's still early access. Would love to see more to the game too. For now, a negative review so that people don't get disappointed expecting a fair and fun play with optional payments to boost the appeal of the game. I might change the review once good design practices kick in.\n\n*0.34 version review*\n*Review crushed!*\nJust when I wrote my review, an update came out addressing issue that annoyed me the most. Ok, sure. I can recommend the game now. I cannot assess for certain that game is unpassable in late game for those that would want a challenge with a free game, thus not spending a dime on this game. But the game is fun and I did enjoy it, still do. It has a nice pace of an incremental/clicker game and pleasing visuals to boot.\nThe game has still some issues, as all early access games do. For example, it only calculated play time while it was active. Which would be a minor bug unless it uses that data for achievements. With an achievement of 1 year play time, it doesn't look too good.\nOther than that, more content, more fun. Game looks and plays good and can be improved upon if greed doesn't kick in.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alturama/recommended/459820/","alturama","Alturama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alturama/","67 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nLet me get this out of the way now: Moist. Blame Pamu for asking me to write that. (Proof/Spoiler: http://imgur.com/J3B2dWx)\n\nSo I'm uprating this overall, but this game isn't without some HUGE flaws. I'm also not going to lie, I did save edit (sorta) in order to complete this game in a reasonable time, so consider this when reading. In my defense, it is early access.\n\nSo let's be nice here and start off with the pros:\n~Funny story/dialogue: This game mannaged to make me laugh a lot. Cassie is refreshing, and fun to see grow. She's the first character and a good way to say hi to the player.\n~Reference whoring: And not a damn thing wrong with it. It adds greatly to the humor.\n~4th-wall breaking: Happens a lot and add to the comedy.\n~Gameplay: Solid time management/clicker to idle your time to. Nothing groundbreaking though.\n~Pacing early game: Progress seems meaningful and you meet a lot of characters in the first 3 hours of gameplay (without cheating!)\n~Soft reset is meaningful early game.\n~Enjoyable early game.\n~60USD buys all perma buffs and time blocks needed to use everything\n~Fair job system\n\nThis may seem like a small list, but this lead to me wanting to complete this game at first.... but I did say flaws:\n\nCons:\n~Free Gems/Diamonds are capped at 100 (98 after Pamu's had her way with them). There is no chance to earn them by low chance means like most clickers.\n~Diamond shop is broken (time skip will often lag, and clicking the only button you can will charge you x2 to 15x times more than the required amount to unlag it. xing out will charge you and not do anything. This lead to me save editing)\n~Max gifts per transaction is 1000. This sucked late game with the last two characters needing 2000+ (up to 50000)\n~1 job is locked behind a hobby cap.\n~All perma buffs are needed in order to "complete" the game in under a year.\n~Hobby system basically requires you to buy things in order to get the last 5 characters to max before you get bored of the game.\n~1 money achivement will take you 430623 days (give or take a hundered hours) at max paid buff/soft cap buff (That's means a 65536x Speed bost), with all jobs running, to get. number below is 1 day at max speed:\n232221621171478\n\n\nIn short, yes, it's free to play, but most clickers offer a long but rewarding option outside of a paywall in order to "beat" the game or get paid currently infinitly. So play it for a few hours, if you like it, dump 40-60USD on it and you'll finish in under a year without cheating. Hopefully this will be fixed upon release. Have not done Beta yet.\n","May 22","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storylines and dialogue are well-written and rather humorous in certain areas. All of the girls are designed perfectly and (to the best of my knowledge) are never off-model. Seriously, mad props to the artist. My only suggestion (for now) is that the game needs something to keep you playing long after you've completed the main quest(s). I'd like to do something other than check my progress for a few minutes each day.

This is a move that spoils quite fun game mechanics, making the game ultimately pay to win. I know it's still early access. Would love to see more to the game too. For now, a negative review so that people don't get disappointed expecting a fair and fun play with optional payments to boost the appeal of the game. I might change the review once good design practices kick in.\n\n*0.34 version review*\n*Review crushed!*\nJust when I wrote my review, an update came out addressing issue that annoyed me the most. Ok, sure. I can recommend the game now. I cannot assess for certain that game is unpassable in late game for those that would want a challenge with a free game, thus not spending a dime on this game. But the game is fun and I did enjoy it, still do. It has a nice pace of an incremental/clicker game and pleasing visuals to boot.\nThe game has still some issues, as all early access games do. For example, it only calculated play time while it was active. Which would be a minor bug unless it uses that data for achievements. With an achievement of 1 year play time, it doesn't look too good.\nOther than that, more content, more fun. Game looks and plays good and can be improved upon if greed doesn't kick in.

If you play smart, don't buy the stupid ♥♥♥♥ aka skips/time blocks/resets/gifts/etc., then you will be fine. Just saved up my gems, bought the speed boosts, prestiged and I was set. In the time of writing this I am down to the final 4 girls until they come out with more. Only reason I'm not finished with them will be explained shortly.\n\nNow then, Crush Crush is a time-management idle (sort of) dating sim that revolves around you, some hopeless loser who lives in a tent in the country, making ♥♥♥♥-teasing ladies/bears/gods/demons/holograms, who are sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥, fall in love with you. I should also mention they never put out so don't get your hopes up.\n\nThis is first and foremost a damn time-waster. If that term alone turns you off then this game is not for you. Quite frankly however I would believe that would apply to all games in a sense. Unless your professional or Korean/Japanese.\n\nComedy is a rather subjective opinion I don't necessarily like to write as a pro due to everyone having different senses of humor. However since it is a huge staple in this game, I'll make an exception. Luckily with each girl having a well varied personality this makes for an huge assortment of different humors whether you like video game/internet memes/tropes, bears, masochistic, sexual, ♥♥♥♥ that will make you question your intelligence, irish, pop culture, cats, southern belle, tsundere, cringe, ♥♥♥♥, and even some inception ♥♥♥♥, there is something that might tickle you. They aren't even done making this so there is even more girls we haven't seen. Personally funniest thing for me was between being the "beef chief" or the ♥♥♥♥ing look of you starting off.\n\nGoing off what I said previously there is a variety of girls that touch down on many grounds. Most of which I would say are pretty unique with some that are uhhh.. rather blatant. People will like what they will though. That being said I was glad to see they didn't seem to be just copy/paste cannon fodder, though be it some were not original it didn't detract from the game being enjoyable with a cast that went well. While still on the case of characters, I will throw in my tidbit on the dialogue. Quite honestly, I wasn't expecting much, but was well surprised. That being said though, it still definitely needs a lot of work. I am sure you will all improve as time goes on, developer/s.\n\nFinally we come down to the last two problems. The first really isn't so much of a problem as it's really only a ♥♥♥♥♥ early on. Which is the economy. When you first start out, making money can be a serious ♥♥♥♥ing pain. However after 3-4 prestiges, this is no longer the case. Quite frankly I just wish there was more to buy. THAT ISN'T PAMU'S ♥♥♥♥ING 50,000 DRINKS THAT YOU CAN ONLY BUY IN 1000 INCREMENTS. Needless to say that ♥♥♥♥ got old quick. Back on track, as I stated before it's not really a problem as it is a halfway plus in the game due to it being a feature in the games comedy.\n\nThe second is an actual problem. Whereas making money becomes easy later, leveling skills in late game will take you a god damn century. Especially if you actually want to get the 90 wisdom and 90 lucky to become a ♥♥♥♥ing wizard for whatever reason. I understand the game is all about biding your time. However if everything else becomes easier besides that one trait, there is an issue. Especially for the in-game achievements I see that say to have a ♥♥♥♥ing year of play time, holy ♥♥♥♥. This is a problem, but it does have a simple solution based on how you go about it. Needless to say the game needs balancing. Simply make times balanced out or add in new content that can take place in the waiting period. There are many ways you could go about this and ultimately the choice is yours. It is an idle game afterall.\n\nOverall, I have enjoyed playing Crush Crush and look forward to the updates as time goes on.\n\nTL;DR: This game is not for you.","May 22","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I genuinely can't state anything, this game is immaculate for the area it targets.\nLet's start with the easy bits:\n\nThe music and sound effects are cheeky and admirable, succulent and sweet. The mere rhythm of it gets my heart singing, and is quite reminiscent to the music of Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney surprisingly, despite being in different genres. A small song is composed, about 1-2 minutes long, and is looped. As a music nerd, it fits the setting; running around chasing the girls. 8/10\n\nArt design is astounding; the characters and icons are all wonderfully designed, and years for me to click it. It might come off as slightly blurred once in a while, but you need to appreciate the dev's hard work of designing the sprites. 8/10\n\nRight, time for the hard bits:\n\nStroyline. It comes to happen that you, as the main protagonist, 'crush' into eash individual girl as you meet them. By annihilating their plans, of course they thoroughly dislike the idea of your presence in the first place. However, by providing gifts and talking, you are able to increase their friendship levels to the limit. Of course it's not realistic; it's a video game! But quite imaginative one, and I personally found it pretty comedic. 9/10\n\nGameplay. Your completely average clicker game, but with quite the twist. You may click, or gift depending on the depth of your pockets or your endurance to click. Personally, the 'girl' clicker game has been taught of multiple times ago, but with a different setting (a.k.a Sakura series). But coming from an Early Access game? There's already so much content that's already been unlocked with the gift system, prestige system, hobby system and job system all being well thought out from hobbies increasing in time duration as and when your level gets higher, to actual promotions in-game based on the amoutn of times you've been 'credited' with in-game currency. And offline capabilities? 7 days? Count me in.\n\nIn this week alone, I've played 10 hours of this game. And if there's criticism to be made, it's the fact that there's some text grammatically incorrect, hobbies may take way too long to level-up and girls' demands are quite unbalanced. Iro asks for 2 shoes; approximately 118 million in-game currency at Awkward Besties, when Bonnibel asks for a mere cake at 'Crush' level.\n\nTo conclude, despite the flaws, Crush Crush is simply quite the masterpiece for an Early Access and FREE! game. A mixture of cookie clicker and Huniepop, it simply hits the spot for me. Absolute marvel of clicker games.\nAnd if you've come this far, you should know one thing\nMy waifu is Bonnibel. Touch her, and I'll go Yuno Gasai on you XD\n\nEDIT: Putting some animations in the mix, could prove quite innovative\nEDIT: I clicked No as opposed to Yes ;-;","May 30","true","14.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

So good in fact, that it's the only game iv'e ever written a steam review for.\n\nHere are some reasons i love this game:\n1. The characters: This games characters have actual depth, unlike most dating sims, wheer character development gets thrown out the window. There are deffinetly a few that crack me up, like Elle being just so...i dunno...she's kinda cucoo, yeah, that's the word. And then you have Iro, the rainbow dash clone. I really don't know why, but just...i like it. And then the one chick is THE TERMINATOR! like, thats badass, dating the terminator.\n\n2. It's PG: Alright, i know everybody was shocked when there wasn't any nudes. But that's what makes the game fun. We don't play it for boobs, we play it for fun, like, actuall fun, not the fun in the pants kind of fun.\n\n3. Natural progression: I like how the relationships actually progress. It's not like most date sims where you meet the girl, and she's instantly AAALLLLL over you. It adds more depth to the characters.\n\n4. The player: I actually like the odd looking player avatar, as it's blank. It lets the player envision him or her self in the game easier.\n\n5. Unlimited replayability: This game is a clicker, and it gives the option to restart for a considerable speed boost. There is no real end to the game, and you have to restart, like, 20 times at least.\n\nthis is by far my favorite game of all time...okay, it ties with Prototype 2, but still, it's pretty damn good.\n\nA solid 11/10\n\nIt earned it","May 29","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storylines and dialogue are well-written and rather humorous in certain areas. All of the girls are designed perfectly and (to the best of my knowledge) are never off-model. Seriously, mad props to the artist. My only suggestion (for now) is that the game needs something to keep you playing long after you've completed the main quest(s). I'd like to do something other than check my progress for a few minutes each day. Right now I'm writhing in anticipation over future updates which I'm sure will include new features and more girls.\n\nOh, and one more thing: Moist! (Even though Pamu isn't my favorite.

Out for money and maybe chums.\n\nPrgression is nice, but it's pay for more progress style is actullaly really annoying. Considering you can get 1 gem for each level of relationship per first time getting it is good. Also about gift prices. The dev says the pricing of the gifs are resonable because it's spose to be un realistic...but c'mon really? It shouldn't be insanity just buy something for an early charater.\n\nI gave up on web based version, so I went to steam version. Nice to see it's a little more updated, but reallly not that much.

The design of the whole game is beautiful if you're into anime like I am and it's neat to figure out a winning strategy for the game. I think I've found one and if I'm right I'll share it in this game's forum section.\n\nIf I have anything negative to say about the game it's that there needs to be more then one music track (not all of us play for 5 minutes a day) and that skill points need to take less time to earn. Yes, I know you can save up gems and ONLY use them for skills, which I have, but at 10 gems a skill you get to the point where it's tempting to spend money.

Game hits a brick wall around Bonnibel, the jump in requirements is huge compared to the cash and skills being earned\n2. The speed multipier, while is perfect early on, again grinds to a halt speed this up and you probably solve number 1 as well\n3. After a few days playing I'm now annoyed at buy gifts/dates I can see the requirments on screen then have to click through 2 screens each time (after a few resets this becomes tedious). add a quick buy button to main screen after a certain amount of resets or add a perk tree.\n\nOverall I like it and it's very much in the mould of adventure capatilist, and the points above, although negative are there as advice.\n\nKeep up the good work folks","June 6","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
