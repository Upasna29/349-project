Gives off those good Touhou vibes as it's the more relaxing type of danmaku, though still quite difficult.\n\nMultiple characters with differing abilities, six meaty stages, multiple difficulty levels, boss rush mode, etc. And the presentation and mechanics are strong, too What's not to love?","March 24","true","1.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Co-op works good in this game, its not as balanced as jamestown, where you can instantly revive fallen allies by reaching them, but it works like binding of issac where you can sacrifice lives to revive fallen allies if you really need help.\n+BUTTERFLIES! They are really detailed & pretty\n\nThe meh:\n/ the soundtrack is fairly inconsistant and is a mix of good, decent, and terrible instumental songs.\n\nThe bad:\n-every main character has a support spirit creature that looks like it was drawn by a 4 year old.\n-The 4 year old that drew those spirits probablly wrote the story as well. The story is nonsensical and flat out doesnt make sense at times.\n-Most enemies & bosses that are not butterflies are either average looking or disturbing\n-Some bullet patterns that trap you in a confined space spawn you outside of that space if you lose a life. That is fairly problematic and unbalanced. Is it possible to adjust the spawn points during those attacks?\n\nMy wishes for this game:\n*I know this game just came out yesterday but if there is no subreddit dedicated entirely to adult fanfiction featuring Apex Hornpickle by the end of the week, I just might cry. Internet, make it happen! T.T\n*The horse lady (I think her name is Eve) needs to be a meme now! <3\n\nOverall a solid 7.5/10. I recommend playing with a friend (via LOCAL MP only). Its a silly time that is worth the $2 pricetag.","March 23","true","16.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","12","17","4","0"

Great music and a ton of diverse and strange characters.  And I'm very curious and interested in the co-op.  I'll have to give it a go soon.

Characters are all unique and have their own special diolgoue with each boss. I don't play a lot of Shoot Em ups but of the dozen or so I've played over the years this is probably my favorite.","April 18","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fishley/recommended/367140/","fishley","fishley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fishley/","57 products in account","So the trailer makes this game look nearly impossible, but it's actually quite accessible. Unless you're playing on Harder mode, in which case it's... actually still fair!\n\nWish Project's stages and bosses have cool, varied, and well-balanced bullet patterns throughout the game. I've rarely been caught off guard and killed unfairly. All the patterns feel like they're presented more as puzzles that you need to figure out how to overcome rather than needing to be memorized by repetition. ie, Lots of other shmups have these random fast bullets that make you kinda feel cheated when you get hit by them for the first time (but then you remember them on your next playthrough) - this "cheated" feeling and memorization stuff aren't really in this game.\n\nControls feel tight. I've found lots of shmups in this style force you to d-pad movement, but full analog control is supported here. It's a 3-button game: shot, special, and bomb. Most "specials" are abilities like freezing bullets or changing your main shot mode. Controls are fully customizable including adjusting how slow you move while the optional slow button is held.\n\nDiversity in playable characters is great - each of the 8 characters makes you approach the challenges a little differently which adds genuine replay value. It also looks like there are 8 more characters to unlock. Character art and sprites are a bit weak though.\n\nOther misc notes: Hit detection is pretty generous, but precise. 2-player mode is fun because the players can use their character abilities to work together. Music is good. Trying to earn a gold medal on each stage reminds me of Star Fox 64. No online leaderboards, but maybe they could be added in an update.\n\nPros\n+ Varied, fun, and balanced bullet patterns\n+ Playable character diversity\n+ Controls\n+ Music\n\nCons\n- Character & sprite art\n- No online leaderboards","March 23","true","12.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game has relatively reasonable level settings so different kinds of players can all find their way to enjoy this game. Though it still needs some improvements in bullet design and controlment optimization, I still recommend this game to all STG or Bullet Hell players, because it is already a quality work for an individual game developer.\nAs a failed individual game developer(some how, long time ago), I deeply appreciate how difficult it is to make a complete game by oneself. I hope Wish Project can be made into series and bring more joy to us.","April 26","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean for how much it is, if you like bullet hell at all and are looking for something new why not just pick it up.  Fun characters, interesting story and bosses, and the gameplay is very good and solid. I will continue playing this for awhile.","April 17","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It actually kind of feels like an intro to bullet hell shooters compared to some of the others I've played, yet even though the bullets move slowly enough that I see where they're going it still feels challenging to dodge them at the higher difficulties. The story and characters are a bit simple and one dimensional but then that's the case in most bullet hells imo. The art isn't amazing but the style's consistent so it works. Well worth 2 bucks.","April 11","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
