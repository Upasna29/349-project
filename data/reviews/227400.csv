I cut my teeth like a lot of people on games like Ultima Online, which will always hold a special place in my heart.  The constant danger from both the environment and other players made life precious and your actions have weight.  A simple trip to go mine ore could often become a danger filled epic as you struggle against both PK's, Enemies of your clan and even your own personal nemesis from time to time.  Along came Everquest a few years after UO to instead focus in on working with your community members rather then fighting them.  While nothing works 100%, players gradually stopped killing each other in favor of deeper loots.  Still something was lost to us UO fans.  Danger was no longer quite as "Real"  Since then I have treadmilled through im sure just about every major AAA MMO release trying to find a home to bring back that excitement, I had always steered clear of DF because frankly I was pretty sure I would get my ♥♥♥ handed to me.  I was right! About 2 weeks ago though, I decided why not give it a try.  After all, at one point I use to handle myself and I did still PvP in games like WoW for instance.  I am no coward, in real life having retired from military service and some real life experiences that would make half these hardcore gamers wet themselves in fear.  I could handle this.  Boy was I about to be suprised. (in a good way)\nOkay, so anyone who has played Darkfall Online:Unholy Wars, or its original incarnation knows one thing about it.  It is a very unforgiving, political, no handholding environment.  You start off in the newbie area related to your race (which sadly has been turned into humanesque models for hit box purposes) choice is by far as close to a handholding experience as you will get.  A very almost subtle tutorial (very reminiciscent in feel to EVE Online's Turtorial) will guide you through the basic ways to gain prowess in the game, which is accomplished by completing certain feats within the game (think achievements for all you console junkies out there)  The thing I love is, right off the bat with very little effort you can build yourself up well enough to create just about anything you initially need.  Virtually everything you do gives you prowess so just playing the game and setting out on planned adventures can help you get to certain goals.  There are no levels in Darkfall, you literally just  build the character you want through the skill and power choices you make.  The only skill you really have to grind at are the crafting skills which to be honest are just like any other crafting skill in other titles, its all about harvesting the resources and creating objects.  A salvage system lets you take even the loot you get off creatures and turn into something useable.\nSo my first few days in Darkfall were pretty uneventful.  The global chat is filled with the usual batch of idiots with nothing to say, and the smattering actual helpful people.  I will say this with absolute conviction, you will not find much help out of global.  No, global chat is pretty much redundant.  Trade chat is much more focused however.  Where I think AV did it right is, they instead implemented the Mentor program.  With the mentor program you will actually have a older player assigned to you, to help you with advice and  some have even been known to do more then that.  That being said, my only expectation was knowledge and my mentor gave me that in droves.  I did do a bit of research prior to coming in the game on the clans present and had already chosen my clan before coming in, but from what I understand, a lot of folks end up joining the clan of the mentor.  Either way, you will have to type and actually communicate with people if you want half a chance of getting anywhere in DF.\nI made myself some chain armor a crappy greataxe and decided to see what the PvE is all about in Darkfall.  I found it suprisingly fun and pretty evenly balanced in terms of my characters abilities to handle, and you figure out real quick if a creature is beyond your abilities in DF.  Again no hand holding.  There is no level marker to tell, you simply have to go in and give it a go.  To be honest, I LOVE THIS.  It has brought exploration back into my gaming world.  The world is a dark and sinister place and Agon, filled with fallen ruins, serene environments and caverns and holes in various places does its best to push that envelope.  I even managed to find places that veterans of the game were unaware of.  That is pretty awesome.\nThe only thing I have had a hard time with has been managing to stay on the hit box.  I am partially handicapped and my reflexes are somewhat impeded but once I got some practice in, it is easy enough to stay on target.  PvP though provides a whole different dimension to combat.  The custom roles patch that just went in effect has certainly made things interesting.  Now gone is a lot of the cookie cutter class runs of the past as players new and old are trying to figure out what they feel comfortable with.  I am sure it will not take long for the flavor of the month meta gamers to start touting ultimate builds, but for now everyone is kind of playing around with the improved options which honestly give a TON OF FLAVOR to character building.\nTo fans of old school DaoC, I would highly encourage you to check out DF:UW.  It really has that old frontier feel that a lot of us were big fans of.  It also does one thing that very few PvP games do.  It gives me a better reason to want to defend my clans holdings, to expand them.  I am motivated beyond just racking up points so I can prestige etc.  I have a stake in this world, and I think that is important, because even DaoC to some extent failed to bring that to the table for me.  Yes, I have spent most of my gaming time as a carebear, more interested in the crafting and pve content then pvp.  But Darkfall has changed that for me.  While I am still not 100% hardcore into PvP, I do like mixing it up and I feel a real reason to do so.  There is something to be said for that in a game.  So this has been a old carebears review of why I think Darkfall Online:Unholy Wars deserves a second look, a third look.  Yes it is tough, but thats good, challenge yourself.  If you just put the time and effort in you will not regret it.  Now is a great time to jump on board as well, not only is the playing field slightly more even as everyone figures out the impact of the custom roles patch but AV is running a new player special as well.\nI hope this mini review is helpful to others like me that sit somewhere in the middle between hardcore gamer and casual gamer.\n","June 17, 2014","true","302.6"," 144 of 185 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","144","185","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/claysturm/recommended/227400/","claysturm","Sturm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/claysturm/","199 products in account","I am a veteran Ultima Online player, and I loved the hardcore elements that made the game challenging and rewarding. Where UO was like a sandbox world with severe consequences for those who chose to PK, this game has none. In UO, becoming a PK was taking a big risk so people didn't just try to murder everyone they saw. There was actually a virtual society in that game world where PK's were notorious but not so rampant that the world was unbelievable. Darkfall is not a virtual society. It is simply a murder simulator. Everyone you see outside of the newbie zone just rushes at you to try and kill you and loot your corpse. This game is just a deathmatch MMO.\n\nIf all I wanted was to fight everyone I saw, then I wouldn't waste time grinding for gear and levels in an MMO, I would just go play a competitive shooter with way better gameplay. I go to MMO's (particularly of the sandbox variety) for a virtual society and community. Again, I loved UO's unforgiving nature, but it was balanced. If Darkfall added a reputation/criminal system then the game would be a much better environment for a fully fleshed out world that I would enjoy spending more time in.","June 25, 2015","false","47.0"," 118 of 152 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","118","152","3","6"

The hardcore pvp aspect sounds amazing. I love the open world pvp. At the same time, the way they set up their "feat" questing/leveling system is just SUPER grindy. Just GRIND GRIND GRIND. If you're not in a big guild, you really can't accomplish anything in this game besides being destroyed by a group of players when your roaming and having all your things looted. The population is somewhat small as well.\n\nThe combat was kind of boring to me, I like that it's not just tab and press to attack, but it just seems slow and clunky. And the spells to exchange health for mana or stamina and vice versa just seems like an added part of the game that isn't even necessary. Just takes up more spell slots on your already limited circular spell bar thing :|\n\nThe crafting is pretty deep, but at the same time simple which I like. Anyone can eventually craft great gear. But then again you have to spend TONS of hours farming, and it's not like most MMO's where you walk up, harvest a vein of ore and now you find another. Instead you will spend 5-10 minutes smashing on one ore vein or hacking at one tree, or collecting one plant. It's extremely boring and not well thought out. I honestly didn't feel like I spent most of the game doign anything but hammering rocks/collecting plants. Or at the funnest of times grinding mobs which spawn all to damn quickly, you can barely skin their corpses before the next wave is butt ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nThe pvp was about as boring, I was in a fairly large guild and when a seige came, it ended up being me standing on a wall slinging spells from half a mile away hoping to even damage someone. It would literally take my spell a good 4-5 seconds before it even got to where the enemies were standing doing the same thing. And while their melee characters ran around 2 shotting anyone they could get close to.\n\nI had a lot of mixed feelings seeing as I liked a ton of the ideas this game had, it just seems like they executed almost ALL of them extremely poorly, turned the game into a super slow paced grind fest.","December 13, 2013","false","77.3"," 301 of 431 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","301","431","0","19"

I don't play through Steam so my playtime is not represented correctly.  I have over 1000 hours pretty easily.\n\nBest current mmo because they put 6 things together that no other mmo does.  Many games can claim to do a couple of these things better, but no other game is the complete package.\n\nFPS style combat with friendly fire, Not tab target, you actually have to aim and lead targets.\nTerritory control with player built cities and siege warfare.\nFull loot PvP.  Take everything from your enemy, whether it's weapons, armor, treasure or even a warship.\nSeamless world, no instances.\nClassless characters, you don't have to be just a healer or tank, do everything you want to do or specialize as you please.\nNonlinear character progression with no levels, do whatever you want to do to build up your character and never be left out because you aren't high enough level to venture into any zone or dungeon.\nDarkfall also has arguably the best ship combat in an mmo.  Ships come in all sizes, from rafts and fishing vessels to man-o-wars that are 10x the size of a house and require dozens of people to operate optimally.\n\nDarkfall is made by a small indie company so the interface and controls can take a little getting used to, but once you've reconfigured your binds and settled in, it's not much different from any other 1st/3rd person action game.  It's based on territory control and clan warfare so don't plan on playing solo for too long.  There are plenty of clans in the game that are always looking for new members, it's easy to join up and start warring with other clans right away.","November 15, 2014","true","0.3"," 67 of 96 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","67","96","0","0"

By retro I mean it plays like some of the older mmo and rpg games that make you return for your tomb stone where you died. For ranged combat you have a red reticle for aim,but you still have to make it hit. No seeker missles if the target moves you have to move your aim or lead him as he moves. Reminds me of Dark and Light and Dungeon Seige and Dark age of Camelot and maybe Gothic. If you want to hit something melee you have be facing the right direction etc..Skill points are gained by doing things almost anything ....gathering shrubbries for any herb or craft material and cutting down trees for lumber grants some points that can be applied to any skill as does smacking a gobby in the head. People have built some really neat houses(castles) and it seems they get raided by clans. All mobs have spawn points so if you have a group can camp there and loot till you are bored or have what you need. Respawn rate is fast...lookout,lol.\nI have just played the free week so i just use the noob staff and start firing away with some cold spell and kill rats in the sewer and goblins in the fields and some undead.

So take these as more of a set of notes, than any type of in depth review.\n\n\n\nDarkfall Unholy Wars is a decent mmo, it really is but I have got to say its really only worthwhile if you are part of a niche hardcore pvp mmo audience. If pvp and crafting are not your focus in an mmo, this is probably not the mmo for you.\n\nCharacter creation is decent/ average, you get to chose your race, skin tone, facial features, ect. But once you get in game you start to notice the differences almost immediately. The game is action based so you will have to aim your attacks and spells in first person, or third person if you are a melee class. The actual combat reminds me a bit of the combat in Elder Scrolls Online, but alot less polished feeling.\n\nThe User Interface I have got to say is one of the worst I have ever seen though. Even after I learned where everything was in it, actually using the UI just felt terrible. I have a certain respect for anyone who plays the game regularly without customizing it in some usable way. The game uses a classless skill based system, and you will probably spend a lot of your time grinding crafting materials and skill experience/ points. I believe there is a way to do this AFK, though aside from just setting your character to mine, chop, fish or what have you, and walking away (or alt tabbing) I don't know of any way to do this.\n\nAs for the appearance of the game, I have got to say graphics wise its nothing special. Its got a non cartoony High fantasy style. The Graphics themselves look to be from anywhere between 2005 - 2008 if I where to guesstimate.\n\nIt does not look bad but I would not say its good looking either, just average I guess. I dont know what else to say about the game besides I reccomend any new players to join a clan. Do not try to figure the game out solo, it will be so much harder, and take so much longer if you dont have help. Dont be afraid to ask for help in game, like what something is or what a stat does, ect. Also watch out for trolls.\n\nOverall I have got to say I recommend this game to hard core pvp and sandbox mmo fans. There is a good deal of fun to be had if you end up liking the game. IT does have its issues, and I do not know how the populations is during normal game hours (I am playing during the free week so there are a ton more players atm).

The full loot system takes me back to the days of wishing for an Elder Scrolls mmo ( i know they made one, doesn't feel like elder scrolls.) where everyone dropped everything and you could do practically anything you want. The game allows full on village raids, and a fun combat/progression system. However, the real seller of this game is that it doesn't give you teddy bears and rainbows and tells you you've won the game. It's not gonna walk you through it. This has resulted in a great player driven community where you have your "evil-doers" and your "heroes". Also, everything in this game is temporary. You will lose it at some point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caimen/recommended/227400/","caimen","Caimen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caimen/","537 products in account","This review is for people who are familiar with Eve Online and I will use it draw comparisons.  I will first list the features that both games have, which is the primary reason why I like these games.\n\nPlayer controlled cities/holdings\nPlayer controlled buildings\nPlayer built ships\nFull crafting system where just about everything in game is built by players.\nFull market system with buy/sell orders.\nPVP is mandatory, if you go out to kill some mobs you always have to be watching your back.\nYou will lose your loot if killed by a player to that player.\nPersonally I played Eve Online for about a year and half, and I only had one single problem with.  The downtime is excruciating most of the time.  10% of Eve Online is great fun, because very interesting things can happen in a player controlled world like that, however the other 90% can be extremely boring.  Darkfall addresses this problem quite well.\n\nDarkfall has many systems that encourage players to leave relative safety of clan holdings.  This encourages players to leave there cities to accomplish many tasks.  There are city levies, which take time to be emptied and you must protect yourself or take the risk of gaining massive loot.  Treasure maps can be found which will give you some basic direction of where to find actual good loot drops to dig out of the ground.  Just recently while treasure hunting I was forced to walk through enemy territory to find the loot.  These are just a couple of ways that PVP is encouraged and exploration as well.  The map is big enough to provide relative enough safety and you can always hide behind a rock and hope they don't see you.\n\nThe sieges and boat system adds to the complexity of the game.  Of course this game is for hardcore players, most people are not going to like it.  Before finding Darkfall I was playing Rust and trying to get into DayZ.  I was interested in the idea of fearing for my life every time I go out.  Darkfall does this in ways I wasn't expecting.\n\nThe progression system makes the game\n\nWarnings\nDon't leave relative safety with any items you are not willing to lose.  Bank your loot often.\nYou must find a group and have a mic, use teamspeak and find a decent clan, most will accept noobs.  Plenty of terrible clans out there, but plenty of good ones too.  Finding a good clan makes or breaks this game, it's an MMO not a single player adventure.  Join one as soon as possible, they can help you learn much more quickly.  If you join Darkfall planning to play solo, while possible, it is not going to be fun in the end.  I play solo half the time until I'm needed for a fight or raiding party, however I'm generally always in teamspeak while playing unless I'm simply harvesting resources or crafting.\nThere is a lot of grinding, if that's not for you then don't subscribe.\nYou cannot repair armor or weapons, once it is destroyed by durability it is gone forever.  However this keeps the market stable and makes it so resources are always in demand, Darkfall has one the most lucrative and stable markets of any MMO including Eve Online because of this.\nCrafting can be very tedious, but partly what I like about this game is harvesting resources and crafting is very easy to do while watching Netflix or otherwise doing other things online.\nThis is not some tab based skill cooldown game like WOW, it is live action and fast paced meaning FPS skill is more important than your actual build in some ways.\nThe interface is very old school and takes a lot of getting used to, however I grew to actually like it.\nGraphics are not amazing nor are they terrible.\nTips\nMake plenty of bags and organize your loot in your bank.  It's the games way of managing the massive amount of items you will find.\nSave all your loot you get.  It's almost all useful in someway or can be sold on the market.  Salvage items you don't need.\nSet out to finish your feats, it's the easiest way to gain prowess.\nGather resources on your downtime while watching Netflix or surfing the net.  Every little thing you do in this game gives you prowess which can be spent on any skill or stat.","December 15, 2014","true","622.3"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","20","26","0","0"

You can vaguely see where land ends and sea begins as well as general look of the terrain from under the blackness. Mobs spawn in certain areas like wooden forts or caves (map has marks for those areas. You can also make your own tags if you find something interesting.\n\n-Lore\n*Well, it exists. You need to dig into the wiki or ask the players about it, but a little mystery is nice too. Still, it could use a some padding.\n\n-Openworld pvp (you also drop your items if you get ganked(killed by player while down)/release your spirit after death. You can get them back if you reach your grave before it's looted)\n*Also openworld ofc. A bit overwhelming at first, but it's nice to set your own goals and plan your own adventures)\n(Quest system is still under development)\nConstant threath of other players also makes it much more rewarding to bring a haul from adventure back to the bank (there are also banks around the world near chaos bindstones (respawn/recall points) but they are unprotected. I haven't experienced much playerkilling around them though).\nBeing chased by another player can be quite thrilling too. It's possible to escape from even high level player since all mounts run at the same speed (there are speed enhancing skills that make you faster than mount, but you can outrun even them if you get enough headstart and manouver well enough (not too much zigzagging to dodge projectiles and using terrain as cover.)\nCurrently there are no stealth skills, but if you crouch in a bush or hide behind objects and use 3rd person(there is 1st person too, obviously), you can "manually" sneak around players too. Crouching also makes much less noise when walking. You must target player/npc directly and be within certain range to see it's UI.\n\n-Localized markets (still under development, partially implemented)\n*Similiar system like EVE online has. You need to travel to different markets to physically get the items you buy\n\n-Monthly subscription\n*Yes, It is a good thing. I haven't seen any bots, gold spam or even cheaters. It also keeps the game fair, which is essential for such pvp oriented game. Upkeep isn't free and this is the most fair way to get money for it. Free to play works really well for some games, but this isn't one of them.\n\n-D.U.E.L  subscription extension item\n*Similiar to PLEX in EVE. You can buy it with real money and sell it for ingame money, meaning that it's possible to play the game for free. Gold isn't too hard to get. Some mobs drop a lot of it and you can also get lucky with chaos chest (random chests around the world that may have huge amounts of gold or almost none. They may contain other nice stuff aswell. You find tons of them if there aren't much players around.)\n\n-Upcoming feature (Relics: Grand items that you can either haul to your clan's church, which gives clan a worldwide buff, or you can take it to demon altar and destroy for prowess reward.\n(Prowess = xp. There are no traditional levels in DF. You buy and upgrade skills and attributes with prowess. First levels are extremely cheap but it gets more expensive higher the skill is. Currently 100 is max for everything. Each level makes skill a little more powerful)\n\n-Graphcis and music\n*While graphics may not be highest AAA quality, I think it's very atmospheric. Reminds me of Morrowind. Music on the other hand is epic.\n\n-Clans\n*or guilds, how ever you want to call them. Much of the game is built around clan system. They can capture villages (in which you can build your own house) and Cities. Citys have allkinds of nice stuff that clan can build there: crafting area, resource nodes for faster and safer gathering (there are also safe areas in which you can harvest, but clan nodes always give full quality resoruces, while regular nodes may give inferior quality stuff, which you can use to craft reqular quality resources.), skill trainers and shops. They are closer to more exiting places than safe zones too.\n\n-Economy\nIt's completely player driven. There are only few essential items that can be bought from npc like basic tools and spell ingredients.Mobs drop low quality equipment and you can find better items from random chests/equipment racks around the world. Rest you have to craft or buy from market.\n\nMixed opinion\n-Resource gathering from nodes\n*It's time consuming and uneventful(thought it also gives you prowess, especially if you get rarer items while harvesting), but it's easy to do other things while waiting for iron node to get picked or wood to get chopped. Gathering makes distinct sound which can be heard throught video if you set your volume levels right. If the sound stops, you know it's time to switch node/tool or regain stamina. This gets a little harder if there are multiple harvesters around you, but then you just need to be more vigilant. In areas outside safe zone this is a lot more dangerous, since other players can attack you, but with large group emptying nodes is much faster and safer.\nI think there could be somekind of minigame for harvesting, but that might not be that good idea in the end.\n\nThings I don't like\n-Inventory system (Devs are making an overhaul to it)\n*Very crude and quite hard to manage if you are in hurry. At least there are bags which greatly help organization.\n\n-Small playerbase (Game needs more publicity. More positive recommendations and/or less negative (and useless, like mere "this game sucks!" reviews) would help too.)\n* This can also be a benefit for new player, since if there are less players around you can gather prowess and resources more freely and thus become more pvp viable faster. The game can be enjoyable even with small playerbase.\n\n-Easy to get away with player killing.\n*I don't think there are any penaltys for doing so, expect for being tagged as playerkiller. I hope devs will take a look of this at some point.\n\n> This is not handholding game like wow or many other mmo's there are. While this means the game may be harder for you to understand and play, it also means greater satisfaction once you start to see how things work. Also the game wont treat you like an idiot.\nOn my experience the community has been friendly and helpful towards new players. There are also currently 2 major clans that actively recruit new players and teach them how to play. There is also mentorship system. Experienced player can take apperentices and teach them how to play. They also get rewards if their apperentice gains enough prowess. <\n\nThere are other stuff too, but this is all I can think of currently. If you decide to try the game, be patient and don't give up. Also watch some gameplay videos first to get better general idea about the game.","November 17, 2014","true","163.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The PVP combat in the game is spectacular for an open world title.\n\nI would ignore all of the 'sanbox' language regarding the game (because calling Darkfall sandbox is a bit misleading); but this game has the BEST persistant world Tug of War PVP model ever.  With the encorporation of prowess monolith's, there is also a daily king of the hill style event (but these events should be far more often.)\n\nA few recommendations to new players: I would try to join a clan (try lost minions or zerg) and use them as your primary source of refuge if you are a new player. Turn global off completely, and use help and trade for all of your daily needs.\n\nThe primary issue with the game remains the population state. It is quite an unfixable issue, as the game is quite fun with numerous players on screen. Fearing that your every movement may lead to confrontation, you will always have to be watching your back;  but without a substantial population, many of us have simply drawn to the corners of the world where we can hoard our treasures to ourselves.

Even with the sub though, it's still worth playing for a while.\n\nThe PVP is unlike any game you've ever experienced. As others have said though, make sure to join a clan, so you can participate in the incredible siege warfare. That, and so you don't get ganked as much out in the wild.

As others have already told, it is UNIQUE on its kind.\n\nBut I can see the frustration of new players, that enter an unknown world, ignore all screen messages and end up bare naked with a toothpick weapon in the first minutes. This game is a full loot. it means when you die near a populated area, there is 99% chance to find your greave looted, all stuff missing. But, when you die in a starter area, you get an option to wait 1-2 minutes and then be automatically revived without loosing anything. Its not games fault if you ignore the message , press space and leave your stuff there near newbies that know what FULL LOOT means. I have seen SO many new player graves. You even start game with a mount and a ship free! (with steam offer)\nThe world is HUGE, its easy to find an area to be alone and undisturbed for quest. Or you can join a clan, which is what this game is all about. Its not a "solo hero" game, as already other mature players have mentioned.\n\nThe other thing is that all players are equal in terms of speed. If you start running with your mount, noone can catch you, since you will be ahead, unless you stop, or make unneeded turns.\n\nThis two advices will help you for your first steps. The main advise is to get into a clan as soon as possible. Most people love new players, will even gift you ships if you prove that you are there to stay.\n\n","November 18, 2014","true","340.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

These people are mainly carebear mmo players who wanted everything handed to them and their hands held the entier time.  I have played 100s of MMOs and this game is by far the most fun I have played. Its an open world, full loot pvp, sandbox that is unforgiving, and HUGE! If you are a fan of DayZ Mod, or any of the open world sandboxes like that,  you will find this title very familiar in some aspects. It doesn't have the traditional MMO feel either, which can be a good thing to the more hardcore players. I prefer this over Mortal online as well for the "hardcore mmorpg" aspect. The game suffers from poor marketing, and thats mainly because the developer is so small.  You can literally pay for your subscribtion by playing the game if you know what you are doing. The clan system is awesome and opens up a whole world of new content. The player housing is meaningful and not just for asthetics. There are city sieges and the ability to capture areas. Clan vs clan pvp and a bunch more player vs player specific content. The mobs range in difficulty, but if you are a good player, you can go against higher level mobs and get really good mats. If you are a fan of open loot pvp I would whole-heartedly recommend this game.

I have always felt instances and battlegrounds etc ruin the immersion and potential fun of pvping in mmos.\n\nEnter Darkfall: Unholy Wars. There are no instances. It is a PVP based mmo where every bit of pvp that happens in the game is somewhere in the world. PVP is cutthroat like those games of yesteryear. When you kill someone all of their loot drops on the ground. It is a sandbox mmo... you can go anywhere and do just about anything... you can customize your class as much as you want. There are not levels, just incremental "prowess" of which you only need about 30k-40k to be pvp viable. At time of writing this review I have 46k prowess and I have killed people with as much as 200k prowess. It took me about a week to get to this high in prowess which consisted mostly of killing different camps of monsters throughout the game.\n\nI could go on describing the game, but I think anyone reading this review will know if the game is for them or not. Gaining prowess is a grind, I find it far superior to questing which there isnt a single one of in this game.  Combat is completely skill based (no tab targeting what so ever.) meaning you will need to be comfortable playing first person shooters to enjoy this game.\n\nI see myself playing this game for a long time to come... I just wished I had discovered it a lot sooner.","June 29, 2014","true","95.6"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

The game is full loot with a giant open world with alot of pvp hot spots and features. 90% of the negative reviews of this game are from care bears that cry when they lose pixels. The game is grind based but in a very logic way and the speed is all up to the player and how well they can multitask on a situation.  The naval system in the game is my favorite feature. No risk no reward mentality. People say the game is dead but in the hours i have played this is not the case. Anytime i wanted pvp it was there. World is open enough for the scaredies to hide and grind up pve solo, but i recommend joining a clan in the game right off the bat as it will greatly increase your prowess gain and fun level. The community is friendly to new players but like any game there are bad apples. i give the darkfall community 8 out of 10. If your interested i say get it and give it to about 50k prowess to say if you think its dead/boring pvp/not fun.","February 8, 2014","true","321.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

I knew what I was getting into because I played Mortal Online for about a year in about 2010, when the game was very buggy and had broken features.  I'm told MO has improved since.  These independent, shoestring budget operations are works in progress, but I encountered no glitches in Darkfall.  The interfaces all worked, the crafting made sense, and the PvE combat was as it should be: I died to mobs at first but then started to get the hang of things.  The environment looks empty, but that's the nature of these games.  People try to stay hidden out of safe zones unless they are looking for action or have nothing to lose.  I played during the Aussie day on the US server, and there were plenty of players around in the town, and a couple in the wild to.  One, who came upon me trying my hand on Goblins and who I basically fled from until I realised he wasn't going to pinch my meagre noob stash, ended up inviting me to his guild.\n\nThese styles of game are superb, fantastically immersive, and great fun whether you like to play a killer, an empire builder, or a running away artisan like myself.  I hope you decide to buy this game and graduate from themeparks into a world where you can truly leave your mark.","February 13, 2014","true","8.0"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

I was inactive for the first 2 weeks due to computer issues. I've made it to 125k prowess and I feel strong. Its enough to max 3 weapon skills, my boosters in strength and dex, my base stats to 100str, 100dex, 70int, 80wis, 2 ults, a handful of leveled spells, and 2 crafting masteries. I'd say the key to get to where I am is to find at least one other solid player that you can farm with alot. Having a farming friend makes the spawns trigger faster, makes kills faster, and gives you a buddy to help you to your feet when you get knocked to the ground. Each of you pick a few different crafting skills to train (as this gives you self made gear whenever you want it, and also prowess) and trade each other for the things you need. Either way, the key is to have at least one trustworthy buddy to go farm with. Its also a decent way to make friends and get invited into a clan.\n\nRunning into other players:\nI typically run into 3-12 instances of seeing other players doing ♥♥♥♥ per day I play. Requisitions, farming mobs, sea scrapping, etc (although its not uncommon for me to spot you, then slink off sneaky-like and get away) ((makes me wonder how many times I had unseen eyes looking me over)) keep in mind my playtime ranges from 3-10 hours per day depending on work and other IRL factors.\n\nStatus of the player base:\nI see tons of new players joining. Near starting zones I see new players with less than 1k, less than 5k, and less than 20k (prowess) that I've never seen before running around (particularly Amurran, wolfland capital) *Note, Ork lands seemed fairly empty when I cruised through there. (a good place to start without alot of people killing you early on perhaps?)\n\nNot to mention that players that took breaks or quit return often. New content draws people back, as does free-play days. Especially after the release of DUELS, (Tradeable 30-day subscriptions players can buy from AV and then sell for gold or loot to players) which allow people with too little cash or unintentionally expired subscriptions a shot at re-subbing for free (well, about 70-90k gold average)\n\nStatus of the community:\nOh dear. Read through the forums and you'll find all sorts of...strongly expressed opinions. Unfortunately most of those strongly expressing their opinions are also closed-minded to other opinions. So, be prepared for alot of loud and ignorant rants/complaints. Some are valid sure, but sift through those at your own risk and judgement. Anyway, I've read through a bunch and my opinionated summary is as such:\n\nDarkfall is an ever changing game ran by an Indie and somewhat small time company called Adventurine. Its come a long way since Darkfall Online, DFUW's predecessor. AV hasn't always been the best with customer support but they're loads better now. People have always said AV doesn't listen to their customers well enough, but they have greatly improved. Keep in mind, that if you look through the forums you can find 100+ submissions for "How to improve" or "How to fix" things in darkfall. The trouble there is that there is 100+ posts! AND- reading through them myself, I saw many that were too poorly worded to follow fully, another handful that were terrible ideas (IMO), and another handful that I agree with but perhaps not the majority of players would, (or AV)\n\nSO! You have alot of ♥♥♥♥♥ing, about things that bother a few people. But to fix it, you'd ♥♥♥♥ off a bunch more, so AV's hands are tied in these issues. Keep this in mind if you dare to sift through those posts. If you care to comment on them, take the time to speak clearly and consider how it would fit in with the rest of the game.\n\nDont be discouraged by these posts. And try and imagine from the content of the post, who the poster is. I see alot of rants that I'm assuming are just cry-hard kids. -- Not worth reading.\n\nA Short Story of my start:\nStart in Wolflands with my brother. Read a few guides, tested a few mob types, decided to wield greatswords. (whoops, IMO) Basically build for warrior type. Goals at this point are to get enough Rank Zero gear to not be naked, get spells like Vamp Strike, Power Attack, Barrage, Reinforce, Bandage so I can last longer (lots of damage buffs/lifesteal, some heals and a damage resist buff)\n\nWhy goblins? -They drop all Rank 0 armor and weapons, arrows, gold, reagents to cast spells, potions, food and some teliportation tools like portal shards and runestones. Also, killing goblins satisfies 5 feats at the same time: Humanoid, goblinoid, creep, varmint, freak feats, for lots of bonus prowess per kill once feats are complete (((Do not focus mastery feats, focus habitual feats. Habituals are earnable weekly, some daily, for bonus prowess for completing the habitual feat requirement. Focusing habituals will get you all your master feats in due time, its very time efficient)))\n\n(@ 5k prowess)\nTrouble is, goblins got boring and easy by the time I finished goblinoids and humanoids. So, I moved on to Gnolls, which drop way better. Avoid Gnoll vilegaunt/butcher spawns till 40k+ prow or with a friend or two. However the Gnoll shaman, tribesman, and fighters are all relatively easy and again they drop pretty sweet. (Coal, Rawhide, up to 3 piles of gold, teleport stuff, pots, plus all Rank Zero stuff) These classes of gnolls can be attempted almost at any prowess level, but I do recommend goblins first.\n\nThen, it was on to Elementals. (I was 20k my brother 40k prowess)\n\nElementals, Ice, Earth, Air, and Fire -- all have their own feat plus the master elemental feat which all elementals count for. Ice, Earth, And air are all doable at 20k+ prow with a friend. Disclaimer- Elementals shrug off elemental magic, so mages are gonna have a unprofitable time casting spell after spell for little effect. Also, elementals hit hard with their spells and comparatively soft with their melee. Mages should consider equipping a shield and a favorite 1 handed weapon at this point and maxing that skill for elementals (and in general)\n\nAt this stage I was 40k prowess, and I started looking hungrily at the bigger gnolls. I'd already considered them best loot for easy kills/low prowess, and those big ones dropped much nicer and even expensive things! So, after buying more skills, upping their levels, and etc, My brother and I moved to Gnoll Vilegaunt spawns. Those ♥♥♥♥ers will be tough at first, so bring a friend or two. Their drops are great enough I still farm them as my favorite mobs (there are spawns that spawn Gnoll tribesman, shaman, fighter, butcher and vilegaunts, with an additional vilegaunt/butcher spawn ON TOP OF the 5-pack spawn, so lots of the tough guys often = fast loot when you can kill em all) Also, I should add that mobs can hit each other, so make them do that alot and crouch behind cover to avoid arrows (big mobs in your face count as cover from the ones behind them, they'll shoot their buddies while trying to hit you)\n\nI killed a handful of other mob types, (look up the troll dungeon for more easy prow with decent loot (but a decent chance to run into other people) I wont tell you my full story with every mob I've killed in detail but I can say -- look at the PvE feats and target some mobs that have good rewards. There are guides elsewhere that breakdown their ease-of-kill and drops. Read those if you want more info than this long ♥♥♥ post.\n\nMaking Friends:\n\nSo, the best thing you can have in DF is a buddy! I've stated so already, you'll grow super slow solo. How to make friends? Well, there is the recruitment sections, you could try that, or invite friends to play darkfall, or... Go knock people over! But, instead of ganking them and looting their grave, Revive them and invite them to farm or hang out.","September 24, 2014","true","589.0"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

When you die in pvp and are ganked/finished in combat the opponent has the choice to enable a Ganking, which kills your character sending him naked back to whichever bind stone you are presently locked on to. The game developers, though very slow do a fantastic job of releasing newer ways to aquire prowess, to help it not feel so damn grindy.\nThey have completed to dungeons to match those that are played in other MMO's with bosses, mini bosses etc.\nAll of this is always done at risk of PVP outside of the Safe Zones of whichever race you have chosen to be in the beginning.\nDeveloping your Smithing and crafting abilities can, on occassion feel very grindy at first but when you realize the ammount of armour and weapons you go through throughout your progression through the game you realize that if you use the items in which you smith to unlock the ability to use the next tier, its often helpful.\nMy advise is if this game does intrigue you, and you do subscribe get involved with a Guild/Clan and often one that is either Allied to, or Owns it's own holdings. it will help out your progression and understanding of PVP systems immensely. Cheers,\nEven with the immense grind. Because of the combat flow, and movement, camera angles and the fact that your not just clicking hot keys 1-0 i would give this game a 8/10. Still needs work but its definitely an under appreciated beauty.","December 31, 2013","true","412.8"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

Will YOU enjoy it? Read below and find out!\n\nFirst of all, you need to understand Darkfall is a pure HARDCORE PVP game.\nApart from the starting/safe zones. you can attack anyone / anytime / anywhere (even party members and guildies!)\nWhen you kill a player, you can loot anything that is currently on him (BUT items deposited in banks are safe).\n\nThat being said, in order to enjoy this game you need to:\n1. Love PVP in its most cruel & hardcore form\n2. Love world PVP as there are no BG's or arenas.\n3. Join a guild (a clan) as roaming alone will get you nowhere (at first). Only by joining a clan you will understand the true purpose of the game.\n4. Be ready to do a bit of grinding in order to level (acquire prowess) - being in a clan will help you become PVP ready much faster as guildies can help you with feats/lend you fishing trawlers (to powerlevel)/and provide you with tips and better understand of the game.\n5. Rebind you keys to your liking.\n6. Get over the odd interface.\n\nIF your focus is PVE or questing or if you dislike PVP or are a very casual player or a loner by all mean stay away from this game!\n\nDo I personally enjoy the game? Here's my experience:\nI started playing this game about a month ago. The first time I logged on I was a bit turned off by the controls and the interface. With proper keybinding I was able to get over this. I then started doing a bit of reading in order to understand better the game and learned how to build my caracther (a skirmisher). I then started gathering prowess by all possible means (mobs grinding & skinning, gathering, crafting, explorations, prowess monolith, feats, etc...)\nAt this point I was getting more confortable with the game and felt it was time for me to start PVPing. I tried roaming around the world by myself but without success. Either i'd meet over geared player and would get crushed or I would simply not find anyone to fight...\nUntil I joined a clan (Zerg), got summoned to my clan keep, hoped on Teamspeak... and started raiding other clan keeps!\nI can now say that I'm truly having a blast playing Darkfall, as nothing beats the feeling of running around with a dozen guidlies / traveling by boats in order to lay an attack on other clans.\nI still have a lot to discover & understand but so far as a PVPer by heart I'm really enjoying this game.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis game is great IF you enjoy HARCORE WOLD PVP and if you are ready to take the time to understand the game, join a clan and farm/grind a bit in order to become pvp ready (you'lll need around 15k-30k prowess, which is easily attainable within a week or two with proper clan support - lots of clans are currently recruiting new players - ie: Zerg clan). Trawling (fishing on a boat is for example a very fast way to gain prowess, but beware of pirates!).\n\nI hope you will find this review helpefull, hope to see you in game,\nBull Rott","March 5, 2014","true","126.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

Some people might be able to judge but most can't. This game is something that can be for everyone from Roleplayers to hardcore PVPERs to PVERs and crafters! The Casuals also can grind to pvp viable in two or three weeks easily compared Darkfall 1 it would take normally 6 or so months to grind to be viable. Its got safe zones for the new guys to get a feel for the game and outside of those safes it all or nothing. It gives me that feeling that UO use to give me while farming material out in the wilderness or solo pvping. Each Class is viable and you be worth it in any group. Tonight after about 120 hours we did our first pirate run and ran into a kraken which sunk are boat. While even just traveling I gained prowess due to the awesome feats that they have ingame!

Its basicly a giant sandbox meaning you can just start doing whatever you feel like from the start. You can start harvesting reasources or killing mobs. One thing to note is this game has no experience bar or levels but instead has a system that uses Prowess which basicly resembles experience but instead of traditional mmorpg games, prowess is used to increase everything from your mining speed, stats and basicly anything you can think of involving character progression. It takes about a week or so before you are ready to pvp. You have a few ways of fighting in this game as well, you can be a warrior that uses melee or a brawler that uses speed, agility and lighter armor than a warrior but who also uses daggers. Or an archer, elementalist or a primalist. Since they removed classes in this game you now have the ability to mix and mash any of these and more that you like so the one character restriction limit they enforce upon you doesn't really matter because of this. If your looking for a giant sandboxy hardcore themed mmo with full loot and have some friends to join you then this game is probably worth a shot with the $15 price tag. If you are someone who gets really attached to items or plans on going solo then your chances of enjoying this game are a bit lower since this game is heavily group oriented.

The only things to do are PVP, Crafting, or kill monsters. The safe zones are gigantic, meaning everybody stays in the safe zones to craft better gear before heading out. Which means there is literally no pvp going on. I have been wandering around the game world outside of the safe zone for the past 3 hours of real time and I have yet to see a single other person. I can fight monsters, but those only spawn from specific monster spawners, and never leave their camps. Meaning 80% of the game world is empty space, which sucks because the game world is ♥♥♥♥ING ENORMOUS. In that 3 hours I've made it from one coast to another, but still not a single person. Why don't you craft then pothead? Believe me, crafting is why I bought the game. Too bad the gathering boils down to, point at this resource node, click 1 time, now afk for 15 minutes. The making items crafting is just as tedious and boring. Queue up a bunch of stuff, click once, come back in 5 minutes. That also makes it frustrating because I have no attachment to any of the gear I have acquired so far. I didn't have to really "do anything" to get it, so I don't really care if somebody kills me and takes it. Hell at this point I'd enjoy the human interaction. This game wants to be Ultima Online, but with a development team 48 strong, that is as likely to happen as aliens are to crown me emperor of earth. I don't wish any ill will to AV, but when you release an mmo you have to come correct. You cannot release something that is 10 steps backwords from the prequel to the game you are releasing. Always Moving Forward should be every game developers motto.\nThis was written almost a year go right after release, so I have no idea on the current state of the game, if it even exists as such.","May 1, 2013","false","22.7"," 58 of 107 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","58","107","0","7"

It does offer more than just PvP but your main focus should be looking for an established and well coordinated clan/alliance to keep you company and hopefully teach you the ropes of the game. The game won't truely start until you've found a group of people to wander with.\n\nEXPECT to get ganked. it's an open PvP game with no real punishment as far as i'm aware.\n\nOne of the reviews i happened upon mentioned that the crafting system was "so convoluted and over complicated it makes no sense." he/she obviously didn't spend more than 2 seconds around it. it's a fairly simple system... it's as simple as just going to the appropriate workbench with the tier of material you want to use and making the appropriate gear with that material.\n\nOverall my personal opinion of DarkFall: Unholy Wars would be somewhere around 6-8/10 depending on how salty i am from my last gankfest. The graphics are decent for the type of game and its age. Gameplay is meh, could definitely be improved upon. not a huge fan of the skill system but it works. The fact that getting yourself into a big clan/alliance is almost required to see a large portion of the game is kind of a downer but it adds a need for being a social person within the game. Last i checked you were limited one character per server per account, so if you made a name for yourself in a negative way players would crack down on you, or just straight out shun you so the game on its own didn't really have a penalty but the players sure acted as one.\n\nfun game though, worth sub if you have the money to spare.\n","October 31, 2015","true","93.9"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

I've played everything from Runescape, World of Warcraft, Ultima Online, Guild Wars 1 & 2; you get the point.  With that being said I'd have to say my top 3 were Runescape, World of Warcraft, and Ultima Online as my number one favorite.  If you have ever played Ultima Online or Runescape you will feel the nostalgia almost immediately.  This is definitely a 3d version of these games with amazing graphics and much more.  I see a lot of the negative reviews about this game and it is kind of disappointing because a lot of them didn't really even give the game a chance... some only having half an hour on account.. I see a lot of complaints about the user interface etc.  But isn't a game more about gameplay? I mean 2 of my all time favorite games had very sh*tty graphics...  I won't deny the fact that the user interface could be a LITTLE better and the game still has few flaws but I mean every game is going to have issues, it doesn't matter what it is.  If you thoroughly enjoy PvP in games and hell even some good PvE this is definitely the game for you...  Some of the mechanics in this game are some that I have never seen before such as player owned cities, hamlets, villages, sea towers, housing and so on..  I've never played a game where you could fight other boats, destroy them, and then take the fight to the water to fight to the death.  This is definitely one of the most exhilerating PvP games I've ever played and I get an adrenaline rush from time to time.. If you try the game you'd understand.  This is a full-loot game where you lose all of your items when you die but don't let that scare you because there are safe zones, banks, and so on.  I won't deny the fact that this game is a little tricky to get used to but if you give the game a chance and actually try to learn it with an honest effort, I can promise that anyone willing to do that would not regret it.  My best advice to anyone reading this review would be to give the game a shot and find some players willing to help in game because there are plenty of them willing to help newbs learn the ropes, myself included.  I'll end this review by saying don't let the full-loot scare you away because there are ways around it and you can farm in safe zones in order to build yourself a nice little bank before you're ready to get into the actual game.  Give'r a whirl, take it from someone who actually has a lot of hours on the game :) hope to see some more newbs!","February 1, 2015","true","57.0"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","15","26","0","0"

I feel like flicking myself in the nuts repeatedly would be more enjoyable then putting up with this poor excuse of a game. Don't get conned into buying this game by the small fanboy base that babysits these threads. The game is dying and the population is dwindling, so the small base that are clinging to the hope of this game spend more time trying to get people to play it then they do playing it.\n\nI was a darkfall 1 veteran for a long time and really enjoyed what it was. There was a major downside to it though which was a lack of a company developing it. I put up with the company that owns both of these titles Aventurine for a very long time and they are GARBAGE. There are promises of patches and updates and things to come, but they never do. This is not just a darkfall 1 problem but dfuw is plagued by the same issue. The population is dying because the game becomes stagnat. They are attempting to run promotions to bring the player base back a little bit but it simply is ineffective. There will be a small surge in players some more money in thier pockets like they always are after, and then people will be bored in a month and it will be dead again.\n\nThe game is also plagued by exploiters and people doing whatever they can to get ahead. Joining the game you will have to remember that you will never be on a even playing ground as the people before you. A major key role in that is the fact people found glitches to dupe off the start, and people are hording a huge amount of the income and properties in the game.\n\nThe pvp in the game is lackluster. The game is far from being balanced and people tend to go towards certain specs in the game and abuse that fact. It becomes very mechanical and loses a lot of the pizzazz that it starts off with. Most of the time in dfuw its chasing people to safe zones where they can sit there and you can't lay a finger on them.\n\nIf you are into pve then this game is simply not for you. Unless you enjoy fighting the same handful of creatures with different skins and never really being challenged. There isn't much else to say then that. It has simply no depth.\n\nThe crafting system in this game I admit is fairly well put together and you can feel accomplished making all sorts of things with it. The major downside to it would be the fact it will take you months of staring at a stone or tree and afking while hitting it to get there. O did I add when you get there you have to look forward to the same boring stuff.\n\nSummary, the first darkfall was a unpolished gem that could have gone somewhere with a good revamp. Unfortunatly the way they went about DFUW with the revamp was not the right direction. BOTH games are lack luster and have failed to hold a player base. The company simply has no passion for thier game at all and thats the cold hard truth. You can probably get a few kicks out of it and some hours of fun but you will get bored and feel like your time has been wasted. The whole ideal behind the game is great but the execution was poor. Beware of the people trying to mislead you to keep this trash game going.\n\nTL:DR  Dont buy it","February 11, 2014","false","65.1"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","22","40","0","1"

I was fortunate enough to find a guild and able to get into some fun situations.  However, these little bits of fun are something you have to scrape out of an empty bowl of a game.  You can have this same fun with several other games without putting in the huge time sink.\n\nThe PVP elements are there, but the PVE elements are so insanely shallow that the only ones playing are people trying to kill and grief each other.  It makes the same mistake so many PVP MMORPGs do and has nothing to bring in the "PVE but would like the risk of PVP" crowd.  When you see another player, there is absolutely no reason not to kill them and take their stuff if you can.  It's a PVP circlejerk but in the worst way...\n\nSo we just have a toxic cesspool of people who are constantly patting themselves on the back for playing a "hardcore" MMO and attacking everyone they see.  Insanely grindy, lots of traveling across empty areas, and a very small population make all the other elements more of a chore than an experience.\n\nSkip it, and wait until someone finally comes along and does it right.","May 4","false","22.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

It was OK.  I would play it again if the subscription fee is removed.   Most I'd be willing to pay for this for a subscription if the developers won't remove it (at this time.  All MMO subscription games of this level end up free eventually.  This isn't a WoW or Elder Scrolls Online quality  type of game.) is $5 a month, maybe.  I would prefer a setup like Guild Wars 2 has.  They make tons of dough because all their Cash Shop stuff is the type of stuff that people want (example: Expanded storage space, mounts, skins, etc...).  There is no pay to play or pay to win philosophy with GW2.  No having to pay to continue once you reach a certain point (I'm not saying that Darkfall UW has any of these).    A decent cash shop is more than enough to keep a game profitable.  This game seems like a great game from the month I played, but like I said before it isn't worth a subscription fee.\n\nP.S. Games with VIP subscriptions only, that give your character extra stuff all the time, boosts your EXP, let's you buy property in the game, or gives you in-game money to buy stuff ever week or whatever is also a bad model.  It unbalances the entire game play between players.\n\nI'd give this a sideways thumb, but since I can't, I'll give it a thumbs up because it is a decent game.  If you're willing to pay the subscription fee then go for it.","May 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Which was final deal breaker for me.\nThe tutorial is also painstakingly boring.\n\nStill there is a good game under all of that and it's certainly worth the gamble at 14.95 for a month to see if you enjoy it.\nThis game would be ideal for someone on a older computer, as well.\nThe main strength of this game, is it makes the players be social. You must be social to survive. Which is a must in my opinion for any great MMO community.\nSo if you have dreams about silently grinding and not talking to anyone? Look elsewhere. This isn't a game like WoW where you can play it like a single player game.\nSo yes it is worth the gamble, just don't expect much and see what happens.","July 14, 2014","true","0.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

However alot of work and thought has been put into making it what it is today and the biggest issues have largly been resolved. The economy patch as well as other improvments have made loot tables far more interesting and valuable. Changes to how higher end materials are aquired give players several different methods and path to aquiring them. The combat system is robust and highly customizable. The siege system is better than it has ever been. The removal of diminishing returns on prowess aquisition makes advancing your character much less grindy. Overall I feel darkfall is at the point where it is realizing its original vision. There are several improvments to gUI beign worked on as well as some other features like an alignment system which are on the horizon. There is talk of more sandbox type features being added in the future. If there is one thing this game is suffering from it is reputation and too few players. I think this game has a real shot at regaining momentum as there is no other game that is truly comparable to darkfall. It has built an excellent foundation to build on.\n\nSome of the negative reviews on steam are well deserved as this game has had some rough patches, however being an MMO and its continued development this has changed. I am very glad to have rediscovered this game, after being away since the launch of DF:UW I can say it is a much much more enjoyable experience.","November 2, 2015","true","0.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

You are not limited by your prowess or gear in this game, it is purely based off of skill. You have to manually aim everything for PVP and PVE, you also have 3 different stats to maintain during a fight. Health ,Stamina and Mana, if you are to run out of one of these three stats you can transfer from another stat into it. Stam to Health,  Health to Mana and Mana to Stam. Run out of them and you are pretty much dead.\n\nSecond: Community, if you are good, people will know. The servers are small so it is easier to make a name for yourself. But with that said, people may focus you or your clan mates due to how you play. Playstyles such as 5A.M blowing people sh!t up isn't cool, so generally people will go figure out who did it and then go blow your sh!t up.\n\nThird: Open world, back to PVP there are 4 different safe zones on the map, other than that everywhere else you can be killed and any item that you currently have on your person can be looted. Another thing is sieges, anyone can go to a siege regardless of what clan you are in. People who do this generally help the clan they hate the least in this situation but also remain hostile to them.","June 30, 2015","true","246.1"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","1"

The character creation is still ugly and clunky though - but don't let that fool you, the gameplay after that is fantastic.\n\nRight now the old tutorial is disabled, so it can be a bit overwhelming for new players. Apply to join an active noob friendly guild from day one. I mean it. The best help and advice you can get is from veteran players. Just ask in global chat which guilds are currently recruiting new players and do it right after you login into the game for the first time.\n\nA hardcore dark fantasy MMORPG with big open world, free PVP and full loot.

I found it strange and unengaging although it did feel like it ought to be fun it kind of grinds to a dead end when you finish most of the tasks. After that you have to go and do pvp I guess but thats not my style or at least there needs to be a better intro to pvp.  The auction house is broken because there is nothing you can afford as a new player, there are great buildings that are empty and all the shops are outside in the same format in every town. Crafting is cool but gear is dull and you need to save everyting but silly weight penalties stop you carrying it around above snails pace even in town to get to crafting areas. Harvesting system is silly various varieties of plants/trees/stone/ore all yield same materials so just go afk and while your character overburdens himself and then spend an hour crawling back to town. So easy to mix it up a bit and make it interesting to harvest different plants trees etc. Only thing I can say is I didn't get into the pvp so maybe that's my fault, not the game's and maybe that's the best bit....","December 2, 2014","false","49.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

This is an amazing skill based game and second to none in the market when it comes to pretty much all aspects such as PVP, PVE and crafting. This game is not as good as its predesesor but its still the best game currently out there (full aiming control over where I shoot my spells or arrows as well as building player cities online in a single seamless map (no load screens - except if you teleport or enter a dungeon (fair enough)) is simply awesome and cannot be found anywere else. Yes the game has less that ideal population but by giving it a go and speaking to more experiences players so that you dont quit after a day will only help solve the problem.","March 25","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

[Latin, Let the buyer beware.]\n\nPros:\n- Market Sales: Items and Gold go directly into your Avatars Bank, no mail system!\n- Active Environments\n- Harvesting (Harvest doesnt require user to continue to re-click)\n- Discounted Subscription Rates\n- Nightly 1 hour Maintenance\n\nCons:\n- Steep Learning curve\n- Time Investment\n- Loading Screen Times overly long  *ALT-TAB*ing = High chance of game crashing completely.\n- Steam Overlay problems\n- Not being able to craft when having a shield equipped\n- No taxi service\n- GUI: Side of screen (switches), icons, quite small.\n\nI have played mmo's since they were text only games, been on design teams, and beta tested the original Project Entropia, now Entropia Online(link at bottom), back in  early 2001 on through to Gold and beyond.  My mmo experience spans years of playing across multiple platforms and operating systems, I tend to have more then one installed to get what I am looking for when the time arises, though to me this game fails to bring anything "ground breakingly new to the table", this is not the first mmo to have "non-Tabbing" it's certainly *Not the best PVP* that I have played, it's not the "largest loaded map...", in the mmo world, it has a lot to offer and a new player will never fully realize the potential of the game without investing in it.\n\nBelow is a big read and a partial experience of my hours of game play during the Free time provided by DFUW and Steam Hosting.\n\nMy rig hums along nicely and I enjoy most games with decent to ultra settings, without taxing my system. Perhaps DFUW's lower fps and constant dc's may be due to *bugs with the Steam Overlay meshing with DFUW, I know I was affected by the endless screen shots bug and needed to turn off Steams Overlay, to get to playing a bit smoother. I also deleted all 1378 screen shots!  The loading screens were a bit...long, and I found out early on that I could not simply "ALT-TAB" out during loading screens to desktop without crashing the Program fully.\n\nI had a chance to try out spell caster, skirmisher and settled on the hack n slash nature of the warrior class, for the most part the tutorial was helpful, until I crafted too many items and no longer had the starting gold to complete making a Saddle, and thus breaking my Tutorial, forcing me to find an alternative way to continue.  On a side note I was not able to actually craft any items with my Skirmisher class, I had tried re-logging which I disliked due to the wait times and no ALT-TABing, only to finally find out in the Chat channel that it is a known Bug that you may not craft whilst you have a shield equipped...\n\nA helpful player /W Whispered me from my query's in the chat channel, and offered to give me the gold I needed to complete the tutorial, I declined as I would like to know how to make in game currency and get out of the situation on my own...  the suggestion was to harvest ore from metal deposits in the safe zones, and sell that...\n... Thus I went through the new player city mining metal ore deposits until my pickaxe broke!  So I went to the general store, to buy a new one, and double clicked a few times, before I realized I was buying pick axes per double click it was too late, at 5 gold each, I now had 2 new pick axes and 1 gold.  I took my Iron Ore and Inferior bits off to the Smithy, I was able to craft once - as the crafting costs 1 gold per craft.   At this point I felt the only way to make money now would be to sell it on the Market and get what I could...  Unfortunately I did not have enough in game money to use the market left, and this left me to offer a sale via Trade Chat.  I checked market prices for Iron ore at 22g per unit that day, I offered a Trade of 7 Iron ore for 100g, I asked in main chat and was told to bother the people about trades in Trade chat, after re-posting several times over 40 minutes, a player whispered and offered to help me out, they did not want my Iron ore, or anything else, they game me 2,000 gold some advice and told me to pay it forward.\n\nI enjoyed the market system quite a bit once I had some money to play with...   Not having items sent to a mail box and or money was a real treat!\n\nThe game play reminded me of early console "Bards' Tale" *STYLE* Games, with accuracy of attacks being counted for where you swing your weapon, and/or if you actually hit your target with a projectile, be it magical or otherwise.  Thus the PVP was no big thing for me either, perhaps my years of Project Entropia playing, makes me think less of DFUW, play style....  there are countless games out there not just the ones on steam, and not just in the America's!  There are non-English mmo's that would blow your socks off, that you may never realize exist.\n\nI explored out of the safe zones, I died out of the safe zones, I PVE'd and PVP'd, I worked with a group to farm prowess, both acting as support and skinning team, I had an enjoyable experience in that style of team play, of which I have had in most other games, thus team play is what I want out of any mmo....  I joined a clan.  I like to do some solo PVE as it gives me a chance to see the world and learn first hand knowledge, I had my request in to join, and went with the farming group even though I was still solo, after 40 minutes I had gained +400 Prow and the system was shutting down for nightly 1 hour maintenance. Our group disbanded... a day later my application was accepted, yet I could not get the attention of anyone in the alliance to tell me how or if I could port directly to the main clan city... in the end I took everything off my character, except the starting weaponry you are forced to keep, and a skinners' knife (I chose to bring), and set out... great way to explore btw - the Green Shield soon was blinking and a 10 second Warning flashed on my screen and counted down... I passed mountain ranges, snowing passes, water falls and fields of blood... the red shield got up to the roman numeral V before I even got half way down the map, leaving a slug like trail of visible land behind me....  at one point another player rode up behind me on a silver bear... I had pressed "Num Lock" and just let my avatar run whilst I worked on my laptop... the player stopped then turned and rode off... I explored a few fields, some structures etc when I fancied a look around, it took nearly 2 hours to *run* to the clans property, and another 5+ minutes to get to the city, then I spent maybe 15 minutes trying to figure out how to get inside!!  I used markers in the city to note where the clan bank, mines, farms, timber lot etc were so I could find them easily.    Not having the ability to taxi from one place to another is a big drawback to me, only being able to be bound to 1 stone also was useless after binding myself to the clans stone, as the only way to get to a world wide market was in a major city, as the clan market was just for the clan!!!\n\nIn the end I spent easily 90% of all my time Gathering and hitting Mobs to gain the much needed supplies, armor, gold, prowess, to advance in the game, was it enough to get me to shell out $20.00 a month after exchange rate and taxes?  No.\n\nEnding prowess 8.7k, ending gold 27k, lots of banked resources.\n\nThe real drawback for me was TIME INVESTED to ENJOYMENT EXPERIENCED. The scale is heavily weighted on the Time Investment part in this game, however if that makes you happy, go for it... I've invested thousands of hours and dollars of my life in game play, over ten's of years! There is another way to get "real life 3D team experiences".... that though requires you to put some clothes on, shoes too, and head outside, I know that sounds scary, but trust me it's worth every moment of it!\n\nEntropia Universe "3D MMO Multi Virtual World Real Cash Economy Experience"\nhttp://www.entropiauniverse.com/","November 19, 2014","false","42.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I reccomend this for anyone who wants a hardcore PvP experience and anyones whos never played this is not truely a PvP gamer.\n\nNow to the reason this is a bad review. For everyone whos built a decent ship had 5-6 geared guys opn it jsut to have 8-9 rafts roll up fll of naked guys and take it from you its jsut not cool, not becasue your outumbered or nothing, but becasue theres a frickn ladder reaching all the way down to the bottom of the ocean (exadurated) letting any living thing thats "under" your ship to get on top. What this means? Even on the biggest ship and sailing along at top speed, your not safe from people geting on your ship un-invited from the water. Hostile or not it dont matter, theres no way to lift the ladder. So when theres a ship battle, hardly ever is it actual a ship battle, its normally jsut a ship and a bunch of people swimming from 20km away from shore to jack the ship. So if you are looking for a game that adds awesome ship battles liek you see in these videos? Move along! You wont get it....ever. Even at teh sea fortresses where you have to take teh fortress with a ship, all the ships ahrdly ever fight, its always a boarding fest from like 10km away. Now it would be cool if in order to boards from one ship to the next you had to board from another ship using ropes or climbing harpoons, but its not even that, all anyone ever needs to do is just hop in the water, take a little doggy paddle and climb your ships built in ladder. If this game adds in a ladder that you can retract on teh ships, then I m,ay take this bad review away, but as it stands, its just stupid.\n\nCity PvP.....walls?...why sue them....people jsut launch themselves over walls with magtic anyways.....walls are kinda pointless, all they do is make the city look pretty. Wahst the point of walls if you can simply jsut launch over with magic. Now it would be cool if you had like a ladder or somehting deployable that lets you get over, but it doesnt not have that mechanic. Picture this.....your in your city all peaceful like.....then the next thing you know theres 20 guys on top of you without any warning, and the walls you see guys hoping over the walls like fleas over dog hair....yaaa may as well not waste materials on walls.\n\nThe above two paragraphs is why I give this a negative review. The game promises awesome sea battles and awesome seiges, but does not deliver on either one because of the points mentioned.

Nothing like preying upon  new players to gather resources instead of gathering the resources the tedious way.  Pretty clear based on armour/upgrades the player is experienced and makes a practice of preying on new players. Why play a game where it is okay to kill another player during respawn and take everything he worked to\ngather/craft? - better guide at beginning might help but the glorifying of ganking (killing) even when taking avantage of players not in combat with you.  This behaviour drives people from an online game - why play with lazy vicious people you would not want to associate with in real life.\n\nI am okay with dying and losing my stuff but an unregulated community in the unprotected area means plenty of people will chose to play some better game.

Granted, this game is supposed to be a "sandbox" MMO, so I suppose it's partly up to the player to make their own meaning out of it, but the fact you aren't even given any lore as a launching point makes it hard to get engaged.\n\nThe game also doesn't respect your time. There seems to be a heavy focus on gathering and crafting, but long harvesting times coupled with a chance to fail at the crafting process means that the time you spent harvesting is long, tedious, and potentially wasted.\n\nBut if you like to watch your character performing the same harvesting animation over and over, then I suppose this game is for you.","November 18, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Great game in many respects, but two huge problems:\n\n1. Ifyou love full-loot open world PvP you are probably already playing. Game is a nightmare for new players since they will be constantly ganked by very experienced and much better geared players. As a noob in crappy gear, expect to die alot and not really have many options because of that.\n\n2. As a PvP game you would think cheating would simply not be allowed. The Banhammer is still selectively used, a point aggravated by the fact that the dev team plays the game and is part of a couple clans. These clans don't ever see the Banhammer.\n\nThe world is beautiful. There is a lot to do.

I'm not talking a bad internet connection, I'm talking awful programming.

On the one hand, if you like open world pvp and killing other players to loot their gear then this game might be for you.

I pretty much didn't want to play again because I had to craft all my gear over.  You start with nothing but basic equipement when you ressurect and have to hope that all the stuff in your bank can sustain you to the point where you dont have to farm ore or leather for an hour to craft some armor.  I've thought about giving this game another shot but paying 15 bucks a month for a pvp game that I'll get frustrated with doesn't appeal to me\n\nIn addition, if you like to grind enemy spawn points then by all means, this game will appeal to you.  If you don't like an mmo with zero storyline and where the mobs just spawn from a single point and you must spend hours a day farming prowess (xp) then avoid this title.","December 19, 2013","false","10.9"," 16 of 37 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","16","37","0","0"

The good news is the devs finally got this game to actually work. the bad news is that only 20 people actually cared by that point. Drop your cash on an early access title for the same price or try elite dangerous if you just want to have something intense to play. There is a free to play ios/android/pc game coming down the pipe that also strives to be an ultima online clone and it's far more promising than this without having a proud history of illegal practices.\n\nI should also mention that there is literally no way to contact "support" and if you changed your email since you subscribed you'll have to get a new card to be rid of this blight. Even if you do manage to get far enough along to try and cancle your account the massive volume of horror storries (ranging from outright fraud to other shady dealings) this company has put people through since launch are very valid and not just "haters" or "made up".\n\nDO NOT give these people your money and if you do make sure to do it through steam or you will not be able to cancle.

Think at&t and comcast try to make an ultima clone by joining forces and you have a hint of what you should be prepared for. Do keep in mind that even this comparison is generous because America at least has fake laws in place to "protect the consumer".\n\nI have kept tabs on this game since it was "forumfall" and continue to shake my head at what came about.\n\ntl:dr don't waste your money on a shady 3 year old iphone game and  if you do make sure you wear a rubber because the devs will just steal from your bank account without remorse.","October 3, 2015","false","8.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

User interface:  it's HORRIBLE, tiny icons requiring double clicks, inventory on giant screen-wrapping scroll bars, no feedback on anything, no lists (most things are 5-6 double-clicks deep in invisible menus). All around terribly designed, without any help it can take hours to figure out how to even get starte with it, which leads to point two...\n2. Manual/tutorials:  There is a new player manual you're linked to with getting started and skill guides on the main website, but they're for an older version of the game and none of the menus, skills, or really ANYTHING in the manual still exists!  There is also no more in-game tutorial so you're basicly tossed in full blind with bad menu's and no help.  The developers seem to have lost all interest in maintaining this game, it feels pretty dead in the water.\n3. Performance: This game has the visual quality of ut2004 yet still cant seem to maintain 60fps (barely 30 at times) on a 8 core, 16  gig ram, dual video card machine that could easily run skyrim on max settings on two screens....at the same time\n4. lack of players: in 3 days i stumbled across a whopping 3 people, from what i'm told apparently most people hide in guild towns and such outside of pvp events.\n5. GRIND: for a game that's supposed to be pvp-centric the first thing i was tossed into was finding  the very VERY sparse mob spawns kilometers from the starting city and grinding mobs endlessly to get stat points.  The AI is completley braindead and mobs all stay in a very small area around the spawn points, which are very far apart on the map.  It really feels like a pointless time sink just to punish new players implemented as it is, even world of warcraft has more fun pve than this, it's horrible.\n6. expensive: has one of the highest subscription costs of any current mmo.\n7. toxic chat: this is really to be expected in any online game but darkfall suffers from the same thing as UO, the only players left playing the game are the people that nobody wants to play with, so when you ask for help in chat you get almost nothing but troll answers and told to **** off and go play a different game.  I havent seen many games more toxic than this one.\n8. lack of decent profession skills outside the basic crafting/gathering/combat, that's it in the game right now, craft gather or fight, for something that origionally was supposed to bring back the feel of classic UO the lack of skills such as stealing, stealthing, tracking, lore, etc is incredible\n9. poor combat, fairly melee centric button-mash fest, pretty much just mash abilities in order because all they really do is change on-hit effects slightly.\n\npros:\n1. full loot, sorta","January 12, 2015","false","8.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Seriously, do it. The next time you hear any of those three words in the same sentence you are going to think of this pile of crap, and it will ♥♥♥♥ you off.

I am not even trolling, but I admit that I am exaggerating. It's still pretty bad, nonetheless. It accomplishes the basics--gives you the controls, shows you what the tiny little icons that were meant for ants are for, etc., but then it just fails, hard. It's so utterly-gosh-damned boring it will drive you insane. If you actually DO manage to finish the abysmal hold-your-hand level, well then congratulations, your reward shall be even more ungodly torture: upon start of the "real" game, you are dropped dead center of the newbie "town" (which consists of about three and a half buildings and two NPCs) and left COMPLETELY TO YOUR OWN DEVICES.

I found myself wandering the empty world for about another 20 mins with not a single encounter.\n\nI then started to ask GLOBAL chat  questions about what/how to get the game going. Mostly ignored, perhaps due to a low population and a influx of newbies.  I finally had to looked up a video guide on the basics of darkfall, and listened to it in the background as I played.\n\nI started doing some feats (kinda like quests) but why not just call them quests? well anyways these feats gave me tasks to do for prowless? similar to Experience points (XP) why not just call it this? well I sit there gathering  wood/stone/cotton for awhile. Started to craft a few items...At this point Im bored to death. The gathering was quite slow, and soon I was carrying too much weight from the materials I had. As you can guess, I had no clue why I couldnt run anymore...so I walked...all the way back to town  before figuring it out.\n\nWell I suppose at this point you can see that this game clearly dumps you into town and expects you're a Darkfall pro. Frustrated but happy I was finally progressing towards something. Once I found out that I had to turn on my monster spawn overlay on my map to know where monsters were I headed there. Almost hitting the 2 hour mark, I got there and found out that skinning was near dumb or perhaps they didnt teach you anything....swithing back nonstop from weapon to skinner knife...I died and uninstalled.\n\nPeople say darkfall is all about the pvp/crafting.  I really dig PVP/Crafting, the way Dark fall Unholy wars was not able to capture my attention was quite the disappointment. I felt overwhelmed with no sense of direction when I loaded up the game. I couldnt find a purpose in what I was actually doing ingame. The cluttered UI was terrible, I played on a 27" monitor and It felt cluttered. None the less if you were able to read it...The gameplay was close to none, and it was delivered poorly once I finally got to it. The biggest deal breaker for me was the lack of direction and gameplay. I felt like my time was being wasted.\n\nI like the idea of the game, PVP, craft your items and do it again after you PVP. Besides that I didnt find anything interesting to keep me going.\n\n\n\n","November 16, 2014","false","1.9"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","2"

And to say it in a short sentence: I am very disappointed.\n\nFirst of all: There is a so called tutorial video linked as web-video on the start screen that is impossible to view as with the resolution it is demonstrated, you can't even read the game screen text or see where the tutorial clicks on when it says "click on XYZ". And it ran too fast to even remember what it told. Each topic was handled very shortly and the tutorial jumped from one section to the next. I've seen 1-page game manuals that were more helpful than this video.\n\nThis game itself did not even have an intro video or teaser at game start to at least explain the general setting of the game world, only from the start screen you can tell that it is a Fantasy setting.\n\nAnyway I gave it a try and started it. That was where the real disappointment showed up. An MMORPG especially when there are that many free to play MMORPGs, must fascinate within the first 15 minutes.\n\nWell these 15 minutes the game needed to start, after a black screen where you can't even tell whether the game is still running or crashed for nearly 2 minutes, you are forced to select your hero from, if I remember correctly, 5 standard hero prototypes (10 if you count the m/f selection as own prototype), without any explanation what this selection might mean for the game and after that you are dropped (also with a waiting time of several minutes) into the game without any explanation what to do, only if you open the map you see that there are some tasks displayed that seem to should help the gamer to learn the mechanics of the game, but as there is not even an ingame-help to check for how to use the interface elements (or I didn't find it) I think that even for an experienced gamer it's not a "start and have fun"-experience.\n\nJust to mention: The last paragraph is one long sentence. I liked the idea to use this stilistic element to show how unstructured and confusing the interface showed up to me.\n\nNot even the graphics or sound are special (they seem like they've been dug up from software projects of the last decade) and the chat system is so crowded that it becomes confusing and the interface is far from being called intuitive. If even one thing were good enough to make up for the other parts...\n\nIt might be that this bad review only comes from a bad first impression, but if you are greeted like this to a game, you'll not be in a mood to try it long enough to look for the highs that could balance the lows.","November 14, 2014","false","0.5"," 13 of 33 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","13","33","0","4"

I honestly really wanted to love it, cause I am in need of a good PvP MMO with open world pvp, sieges, etc.  However, the below average graphics, animation, lack of a good quest system, almost complete lack of direction, lazily jumbled UI menues, and below average UI were very off-putting.  What killed teh game for me was teh under-development and bugs.\n\nMy first time playing I was doing the beginning Feats and they were working till I got to the ride your mount Feat.  Upon reaching it I realized I must have forgotten to de-summmon my rare (and very expensive for a new player) free week gifted mount when i got off it last and lost it... forever.\n\nI eventually deleted my char and started a new one, happily seeing i got a new mount, then proceeded to redo the beginner Feats.  Upon reaching the "Craft a Mount" Feat (which comes AFTER the Ride a Mount) my crafting phase bugged, i lost my ingredients, and did not receive my mount.\n\nThat was teh last straw for me.  If it weren't for teh VERY helpful community, I would have uninstalled this game about 20 minutes after starting it.  SADLY, the game is just too rough around the edges and unpolished/optimized to recommend.\n\n(sad face)","November 16, 2014","false","6.9"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

Some aspects of the game were a lot of fun - the combat, the world is pretty and dynamic, the crafting is awesome fun.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game for two reasons:-\n\n1. The community seems to be a throwback of MOBA enraged teens with a hardon for screaming in your face.\n2. The class system is horrifically unbalanced both on land and in sea (casters can't cast).  I like playing a caster.  Playing a caster in this game is completely invalid.  You have one choice of class if you want to win: a warrior.  If you were unlucky enough to level and skill one of the other classes, too bad.

I got into the game and saw some high level riding a bear, I then went around trying to talk to npc's which all had confusing and frustrating interaction menus and there was no sense of direction to where I went because I could not find any quest markers or directional arrows etc. which made me wonder how the hell that high level guy managed to play this game without going mad over the overall poor development of the game. Furthermore people like that high level and other's who have played the game for a longer time must have not know what an MMORPG is because this game is far from one.","November 14, 2014","false","0.3"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

Secondly, this is one of the WORST UI designs I've ever had the discomfort of using. Thirdly, the tutorial is horrible!!!!!!! It's in the play area, so you cannot see until you figure out to hit Z. Then it tells you to do a bunch of crap with the interface, which you don't even know what the hell it's for. After some painful instructions on how to switch between weapons, sit, place spells, and move around, it has you start saving primary skill settings. Well it allowed Me to mess up and then the tutorial wouldn't continue, because I had accidently made a second blueprint. I couldn't continue, NOR close the annoying thing. Also, the races are nothing special, the only one I liked was whichever had hair all over, and obviously some of the "humans" which almost all mmo's have. The Orc looks like a lizzard man and they are ugly as anything. They could have at least varied the colors a bit, and widened the jawline or something.

Why.\n2) The tutorial was pretty boring. Little interactions and doesn't really demonstrate much of the game, as well as teach me how to play, only what a couple of the keys do (could do that myself if I wanted to rebind keys or something)\n3) Graphics kinda put me off. Sinking through the ground, players jumping around due to speed issues. Minor things that just really bug a player.\n4) All that said above, learning the game takes a bit of an effort.

This is only my experience with it  at less than 30 minutes.\n\nDownloaded during a free week to give it a shot because why not?\n\nFrom the starting screens where you create a character i noticed i was pullung some low FPS. Figured its not a big deal ill fix it in settings after getting into the game proper. After the setup screens i get into game and im now down to 8-9 FPS. This is slightly weird for me as the game doesnt appear to be over the top on insane graphics in this start zone. I go into settings and drop everything down to the low preset and am rewarded with 4 more FPS. I have never had issue this bad with any games. I'll run bio shock on highest settings, 4 EvE clients simultaneously, Path of exile on high settings. I don't understand why the FPs could be this low. Reading through forums and google this seems to be a common issue for systems that should really not be anywhere near the 9 fps area. There was some talk of fixing the chat logs so they dont show as much in history but at 9 FPS i really cant be asked to muck about fixing things like this. Unfortunately for Darkfall's creators this experience lost me.

The textures and models to the scenery don't look bad, but with the way how the characters look, the game is nothing more than turd on a silver platter.\n\nUnless you're really patient with learning this game from the ground up, stay away from this game.\nIt's not worth your time, and you would have a better time playing some free MMOs out there if you're looking for one.","November 15, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiggati/recommended/227400/","Tiggati","Tiggati","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiggati/","34 products in account","This game is a 20% safe area game, with the other 80% all PvP.\n\nIn the game, you can choose to be an Elementalist(Mage), Warrior(Melee), Skirmisher(Ranger), or Primalist(Healer). You also have the choice to train your skills in all of them and switch between what you want to be. But it takes time to swap between classes, so you can only be one at a time, and not switch up in combat.\n\nFor everything you do in this game, you gain something equal to experience, but it's called Prowess.\nProwess is used as a form of currency and is used to spend on your skills. So spend wisely.\nPlayers do not have a combat level, or skill total level, they have a prowess level. The amount of prowess a player has, can determine on how strong they are. But just remember, they might of spent it all on gathering skills and not their combat skills, so you might have a chance. Thats the exciting part. A player with 15k prowess could kill a player with 100k prowess. depending on what each player spends their prowess on. :)\n\nThe game is focused around clans, and taking over cities and villages, with a huge PvP based world. Everything outside of the safe zone is all for all. Anyone you see in the wilderness, you can attack. But be careful, you might annoy a clan, and they might track you down with spies.\n\nThe wilderness in this game has five levels of wilderness plus the safe zone areas. As soon as you step out of the safe zone, you have 30 seconds before your character is unsafe. What you have on you, you will lose if you die. Except your three basic wepons; your bow, staff and sword. The lowest of all wepons that every player in the game has.\nThe deeper the wilderness, the harder the NPC monsters will be, and the more loot they will drop. This also goes for trees, rocks, and other gathering noads.\n\nYou've got the freedom to do what you wish in the game.\nYou can gather items to get your crafting skills up, Eg; mine iron ore and smelt that into Iron Ignots, to make armour or wepons, or just to sell to other players to gain Gold Coins.\nOr you could choose to PvE, and kill NPC monsters to loot items and skin them with a skinning tool to get leather(to craft) and other items.\nOr you could go out and PvP for money, or work together in a clan to keep your cities under protection and fight for them.\n\nOther features on this game include player mounts, player boats, ships and also player houses.","September 9, 2013","true","141.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
