"http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/recommended/202750/","csabber3","Green Lantern","http://steamcommunity.com/id/csabber3/","174 products in account","American Nightmare is a fun combat focused episode set between the original game and the not-yet-if-ever-released sequel. In this chapter Alan is trying to escape from the Dark Place by writing a script of a twisted TV show, where he can alter reality and defeat his doppelganger, Mr. Scratch as he tries to take over Alan's life in the 'real world'.\n\nThe game brings some fixes of its prequel. The horrible and non-reactive controls are - fortunately - things of the past. It's a much more combat focused game, which is proven by a wast array of weapons you can find, from UZI to combat shotgun. The game introduces some - though not many - new elements and mechanics. There are new enemies like the Splitter, who splits into two when your flashlight is pointed at him. The area map and HUD are reworked, where scripts and points of interest are indicated. It's a nice addition since on the contrary of the first game, here you are encouraged to find those "damn" sheets of papers. You can get better weapons and it is fun, too.\n\nWhile Alan Wake's story was controversial but well written, the same can't be said about this chapter. It sometimes feels rushed and underdeveloped. At least the ending is much more clearer now. The part where the game disappoints the most is the level design. There three only three levels non of which are large to say the least. In addition to this, each of the levels are reused 3 times. In the frame of the story it is understandable but still disappointing. To make it clear, it is not a full fledged game, but neither is a rip off DLC. It's something between, a full game with arcade length.\n\nAlan's newest script shouldn't take longer than 4 hours to finish (6 with all the collectibles). Be aware though that normal in this game is easy compared to the prequel, so if you are up to it, try Nightmare difficulty. This can be explained by the combat focused nature of the game. You'll never have to roam trying to find ammunition and your flashlight recharges a lot faster than in the first game. There is a new game mode called Arcade Challenge. It's a simple addition where you have to survive until dawn and score as many points as you can with limited ammunition. You can squeeze a couple of extra hours out of this game mode, but don't expect dozens of hours of fun. On one side this game mode should have been in the first game, but with those horrid controls nobody would've played it.\n\nAlan Wake's American Nightmare is not a propel sequel to Alan Wake but it's a nice side story which every fan will enjoy. The game falls short in some places to the prequel (story, level design) but bests it in other areas (controls, combat).\n\nRating: 71/100; Replay Value: 2/5; To Beat: 4 hours; Played on: normal.","July 31, 2013","true","3.9"," 65 of 73 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","65","73","0","0"

Stalked by otherworldly horrors and mocked by his dark twin, the embodiment of the worst in him, the man must unlock the secrets of enlightenment or be doomed to repeat his mistakes again and again in his shrouded vision of strange goings on in rural America, made flesh. Did you picture it? Because that’s Alan Wake’s American Nightmare; a brazen send up of The Twilight Zone from the perspective of its hapless writer.\n\nHaving not played the previous Alan Wake, American Nightmare would have to serve as an introduction to Alan’s world, and as a standalone adventure, it’s very accessible. There are some vague references to the events of the prequel, but AN can be picked up without any confusion. American Nightmare comes across a little bit like an inverse Max Payne, which is not hugely surprising, considering Remedy made them both. Even some of the stock “this door is locked!” sound effects are recognisable as the same, which isn’t to say the two titles are carbon copies, because they’re closer to distorted mirror images, aptly enough.\n\nUnlike Max Payne, Alan’s not an ex-CIA genetically engineered astronaut cowboy; he’s a writer. Or so he likes to keep telling everybody. He does precious little actual writing, unless you count the rewriting of reality, and even then he plays it safe by working off his old hits.\n\nWhile Max Payne was about gratuitous slow motion gun play, AN is about frantic torch shining and panicky self defence. Whereas Max Payne had surreal Twin Peak-esque horror lurking on the fringes through blurry TV sets, and the funny as hell, worst thing I can think of drug fuelled delusions of Max’s entrapment in his own narrative, these things take centre stage as Alan Wake really is trapped in a fictional world of his own devising, while his evil mirror image runs amok in the real world, the real world as we know it being snippets of radio shows and TV clips, courtesy of the murderous doppelganger channel.\n\nDespite Alan’s insistence at being a writer, his tools of the trade seem to be less the pen, and more the gun and torch. With this in mind, much of the game’s tension comes from Alan’s lack of superhuman abilities; he can’t effortlessly evade bullets, getting out of the way of danger is hard and takes precision. Nor is Alan a killing machine. His greatest weapon might just be the light, his trusty torch being the bane of The Taken; the darkness infused menagerie of slasher movie caricatures and monster mash clichés that really don’t like Alan’s annoying habit of having a pulse.\n\nThe Taken, as avatars of darkness, hate the light, and this light vs. dark conflict is central to American Nightmare. In fact the ideas of motifs and symbols themselves are central to American Nightmare.So when Mr. Wake uses his miraculous ability to focus his torch’s beam, The Taken stop dead in their tracks, unless something untoward occurs, like the fiends splitting in half, which is most ungentlemanly. That The Taken need to be exorcised of the darkness protecting them before they can be dealt with adds a clever twist; the only thing standing between you and undiluted evil is an AAA battery.\n\nHaving this everyday item be the only thing keeping death at bay is an effective vehicle for ramping up the pressure as it plays on and prolongs anticipation of the conflict, which is classic horror movie fare. AN excels at creating these back to the wall, dead end scenarios, where the pressure is steadily piled on, as Alan is encircled by mobs intent on redecorating the great outdoors with his insides.\n\nIt’s not so easy for Alan to outrun them, though he may find shelter in one of the various rejuvenating street lamps, fonts of light that they are. If Max Payne is John Woo, then Alan Wake is John Carpenter (minus all the synths), and American Nightmare absolutely nails the horror movie atmosphere of the relentless supernatural force bearing down on the stubborn everyman, with the only thing protecting him being some flimsy mystical rules.\n\nAmerican Nightmare isn’t outright scary, but it is stressful in a perversely enjoyable sort of way, and competently eerie. This eerie nature is due to a mix of deserted locales, the tense combat situations that constantly threaten to pop up, and the convincingly acted aforementioned video diary from Mr. Scratch, the bad Alan. For all its serial killer bravado and fear of the dark, American Nightmare’s most unsettling aspect is how subversive it is.\n\nPart of the game revolves around finding manuscripts, each entry shedding more light on the story, which neatly justifies the hunt for them. The earnest journal entries tend to be more engaging than Alan’s purple prose, and the implications that maybe he’s not actually that great a writer, until the line starts to blur between fact and fiction within the narrative, which in a completely organic way, questions the nature of sentience, reality, free will and fate, and even the role of fiction.\n\nAmerican Nightmare features some deceptively excellent writing which dawns on the player as a revelation through the barely concealed s♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the narrator’s periodical spiel about champions of light and how ‘this could be anywhere in America’.\n\nMechanically, AN isn’t very complex, but it is both tense and engaging. The ‘puzzles’ if you can dare call them that, seeing as there’s no actual puzzling to be had beyond ‘push button until solved’, are basically exercises in connecting Alan’s occupation to in game activities. They work thematically, but they aren’t challenging. Even the scavenger hunt for manuscripts is sign posted when you get nearby. The only real challenge in terms of the game itself is the combat, which is helpfully extended into Arcade Mode, a last stand survival mode at one of multiple classic horror movie locations, and the source of lots of replayability.\n\nThough it might be seen as hand holding, American Nightmare doesn’t want you to get frustrated exploring for paper, just like it doesn’t want you to get annoyed with overly confusing puzzles. It wants you to experience its story, it wants you to be engaged by its concepts, and it wants you to be drawn into its world (so your evil double can take your place).\n\nAlan Wake’s American Nightmare is massively repetitive. It’s repetitive. Repetitive. But that’s not a bad thing! American Nightmare is centred around a very tightly honed combat design and central motifs that are introduced, reintroduced and then exploded. Events never let up, and AN is paced without hesitation and only gains momentum as it progresses. There’s really very little time to even think about getting sick of proceedings. Its repetition is central to its theme and is never monotonous.\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that the gun play is extremely well realised, with each weapon feeling distinctive, and even, dare it be said, approaching realism. The animation also, bar the occasional ‘I’m looking at the ceiling’ conversation standby is great. Overall, American Nightmare is highly polished, with a consistently good quality in everything it does. It’s not the deepest game out there, but it strikes an admirable balance between cerebral thematic content and a pinpoint focus on action and atmosphere and the relationship between the two.\n\nAmerican Nightmare doesn’t hang around, but it doesn’t need to either. Judge this book by its cover; just make sure the cover you’re thinking of is an Americana doused, enjoyably knowing schlock-fest, with a surprising philosophic tinge.","October 31, 2015","true","83.9"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","50","57","7","5"

So I started playing Alan Wake's American Nightmare with high expectancies, but quickly the game let me rather down own this. American Nightmare is not really a sequel nor a prequel to the original, it's more like a standalone game on the same "universe", but on a much smaller scale, so in the end it felt like some sort of expansion pack to me, using the same protagonist, game mechanics and of course game engine.\n\nThis engine still stands firm and delivers more than decent graphics: it's great in creating an atmosphere thanks to superb lighting, something which the original game used to immensely scaring effect. Although graphics are fine in this new installment, the actual gameplay is not. It felt almost painful to see the original game's tension and feeling of being utterly desperate while fighting off the forces of darkness turned into some Rambo-like experience. In the original game, guns, ammo and the ever-important batteries for the flashlight (sometimes it was the ONLY weapon to fight of enemies) were so scarce at moments that it almost drove me crazy, but the feeling of relief and accomplishment after finally getting further in the story, was all the more satisfying for it. American Nightmare uses the same game mechanics, but provides such an arsenal of over-powerful weapons, an almost endless supply of ammo and a flashlight that recharges in a matter of seconds. As a result of these changes, the entire gaming experience changed from an exciting horror adventure to a lacklustre shooter where I just blasted my way past hordes of enemies. Were it not for the obvious comparison to the original game, I'd probably have enjoyed American Nightmare a bit more, especially since after finishing the story there are a number of arcade-levels where the goal is just to get as many kills and as high a score as possible. These are played on fairly large and well-developed maps, and felt like playing more natural than the story.\n\nThe story, perhaps the main protagonist in the original Alan Wake, is perhaps the weakest point in this newer installment. It's made coplex in an unnatural feeling way and lacks focus. But most problematic of all, it forces the player to play through the three locations (only three!!) three times, each time "altering history" a little bit, but in the end this feels more like a gimmick and the net result is simply too repetitve a game.\n\nI'd loved to give this game a heartily recommendation as a worthy addition to the brilliant original one, but it really fails to do so. As it stands, it's not a bad game, but it did not live up to my expectancies at all.\n\nGameplay: 15/30\nGraphics: 14/20\nSound: 8/10\nTechnical: 6/10 (it felt like being slower and less well optimized)\nReplayability: 6/10 (SP only, but the arcade levels add some extra challenges with leaderbords)\nSteam integration: 5/10 (no cards, a small bunch of achievements, while the original game really shined here)\nPersonal appreciation: 4/10\n\nOverall score: 58/100","November 2, 2014","false","7.9"," 120 of 168 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","120","168","4","4"

It was also a bit too long in the tooth as Remedy seemed intent to one-up Stephen King which induced the "padding" effect which resulted in the game eventually buckling under its own weight.

Firstly a whole new array of weapons are added to the game and whilst certainly fun to engage with they tend to be overpowered making light work of the enemies you encounter turning bookish Alan into a Stallone-like Commando. Though shorter in length than the original game and with a larger enemy variety the game makes you repeat its events not once but three times before arriving at another stagnant conclusion making this addition feel even more repetitive than the original.

The game still boasts impressive graphics, although the entire adventure is spread across only three maps, which you will frequently revisit. However, rather than feeling repetitive, each time you return to a map there are new challenges and I quickly came to appreciate the lessons I had learned from my last visit. The story is more fantastic and, at least in my opinion, slightly creepier thanks to the addition of new character (and Alan Wake's evil doppleganger) Mr. Scratch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/202750/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a spin-off/sequel to Alan Wake. A heads-up about the game and this review, Alan Wake's American Nightmare takes place after Alan Wake, and has spoilers for the first game. It really shouldn't be played until after the first game, and as such with this review I am going to be comparing it a lot to the first game, and will drop a few spoilers.\n\nAlan Wake's American Nightmare takes place in Arizona, in a fictional town known as Night Springs. However, as we find out early on, Night Springs is not actually a solid place, but rather rather more like an illusion brought to life by the Darkness, and a town that can appear anywhere, just tonight it happens to be in Arizona. When we last saw Alan Wake, he was trapped in the Dark Place, and in American Nightmare he still hasn't quite escaped. Instead, he appears where the darkness goes, and in this case he has written himself into reality as a the hero to an episode of the TV series from the first game, Night Springs. He's done so to combat Mr. Scratch, who's called as such as trying to say his real name comes out like scratching noises. Mr. Scratch is Alan's doppelganger, who was seen briefly towards the end of Alan Wake. He's come into reality since, after Alan's disappearance, rumors of the author who went missing into the night has spread, and these rumors have taken on the form of Mr. Scratch, a psychopathic killer who wears Alan's face.\n\nAmerican Nightmare is even more focused on combat than the original game was, but the combat has seen a lot of improvements. It feels much more solid and fast-paced, on-top of the fact the enemy variety this time is much larger and weirder. There are even more guns, and they manage to feel more varied than the original game as well. This is all backed with still impressive lighting effects, and an overall sleeker look to keep up with the more sci-fi tones this game has.\n\nHowever, with the improved combat comes a step-down of a lot of the charm the original game had. There's no full-on exploration sequences this time around, and the atmosphere is not nearly as immersive this time either.\n\nBasically, there's a throw-up between improvements and downgrades. For one, the levels are now no longer linear, instead being more hub-like small open-worlds that you can explore, and generally are fun to as well. There are find-able manuscript pages, televisions, and radios like the first game, but they're more spread-out. There are also guns to unlock, and side-areas to explore just to really explore them. This is a welcome change of pace, especially for a much more combat-composed game.\n\nOn the other hand, the story is not nearly as interesting. Alan Wake spends most of the narrative chasing down Mr. Scratch, and interacting with a few different chicks that Mr. Scratch has managed to swoon. However, the story in AWAN really doesn't go much further than where Alan Wake ended off, and more elaborates on the ending of the first game rather than move past it, and as such really feels more like filler and sort of lacks climax, conclusion, or really any huge developments.\n\nHowever, Mr. Scratch is a very enjoyable villain. He makes more of an impact than the antagonists of the first game, being deliciously psychopathic and charismatic, and dealing in twisted acts with a child-like glee. The televisions you can find with him are definitely one of the highlights of the game.\n\nBut then, in probably the biggest flaw for the game, and something really stupid, is that in the game's story you go through its three 'hub' stages three times each. The excuse is that Alan Wake is stuck in a time-loop, and time keeps on resetting itself so he has to start from the beginning again until he can break the cycle. What this means for gameplay is that there really are only three levels in the game, and each one is repeated three times. They do change things up, areas not previously available open up and different events happen each visit, but it still is a bizarre design decision.\n\nMade even more bizarre by the game's wave-based horde-like mode. This mode is actually a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be, and honestly may be more fun than the game's actual campaign. It's very frantic, tense, with an addicting risk-and-reward system to try and get high-scores in the mode's five different stages. And this is where it gets bizarre, as the 5 stages in this mode are completely different than the stages in the main game, hell some of the stages are actually larger than the main game's stages. On-top of this, you can actually see the Horde-mode stages in the background of the main story, and see the main story's stages in the background of the Horde Mode stages. Why these five other locations weren't added to the game's story to help keep things more varied is completely lost on me.\n\nBut the game's Horde Mode, known as Arcade Mode, is completely worth taking part in. It's inclusion is surprising, but not nearly as surprising as how well-executed it actually is.\n\nFor an arcade-like shooter, Alan Wake's American Nightmare is not bad at all for a spin-off. It's fun, fairly tightly made, and has some fun content to delve in. However, it also as a spin-off feels it misses the mark of what people loved about Alan Wake in several ways, and focuses on the elements that were less enjoyable. Given here, they definitely have been improved, but it strikes as an odd decision.\n\nIf you liked Alan Wake and want more of it, this is and isn't it. In some ways it retains the charms of the original game, but also doesn't quite have everything that made the original game charming. It is more fun strictly gameplay-wise than Alan Wake, but then it is arguable if that actually makes it more enjoyable overall as it misses what made the first game really enjoyable in many ways.\n\nBasically, I cut it like this; The new stuff they introduce is well-done and appreciated, such as the open-world levels, Mr. Scratch as an antagonist, and the surprisingly fun Arcade Mode. The game focuses on combat, which was not the first game's strong point, but it pulls it off much better here, with better mechanics and a larger enemy selection. However, elements like down-time exploration moments, much of the atmosphere, and the narrative are mostly missing or much more limited. And the game is plagued by one big problem, repeating levels, which is made bizarre as the Arcade Mode has completely different levels the devs could of used that are even tied-in with the stories' locations.\n\nBut it's an enjoyable little romp, and an interesting spin-off that does expand more on the world of Alan Wake, while also improving over it in some ways. It isn't quite as good, but is enjoyable in its own way. If you like exploration, the locations are fun with multiple landmarks and sections. The music is still appropriate and moody, with a few-stand-out tracks. The voicing gets hammier, but it works with the sort of hammier tone of the game (being modeled after a parody of Twilight Zone and all).\n\nAlan Wake's American Nightmare is not the sequel fans may clamor for, but is an enjoyable arcade spin-off.","May 18, 2014","true","3.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

What this game does well is the atmosphere, the gameplay, the voice acting, and other minor technical details. What is doesn't do well is the story.\n\nThe game gives you 9 missions, but it's more like 3; you essentially play 3 missions 3 times each. I won't go into detail, but each time you repeat one of the missions there is different dialogue and slightly modified objectives. You'll see what I mean after you finish the game. I think if the story hadn't been set up do this, it would have been a much better game. The game is actually labeled as a spinoff from the original set in the same universe, and man, ain't that the truth. If you were hoping to get any significant continuation of story from the original out of this game, I'm sorry to tell you, but you won't find it here. I would have been truly upset if this was the sequel.\n\nNevertheless, I still found the game enjoyable for everything it did right. If you are a die-hard Alan Wake fan, I recommend this to you. If you have not played Alan Wake before, I strongly urge you to play the original before playing this. If you played original Alan Wake and it wasn't necessarily your favorite game/you thought it was just alright, you might be better off waiting for the true sequel.

Luckily, you are armed with the preferred weapon of mall cops everywhere and a shadows worst nightmare, a flashlight. Yes, forcing your will on those weaker than you with a flashlight has never been more enjoyable, except for in Alan Wake's predecessor game and maybe Knights of the Old Republic.\n\nThe best part of the Alan Wake series is the solid game engine it’s built on. American Nightmare runs so smoothly maxed out on my 7 year old processor and the graphics have improved over the prior installment. Though the other exception to the graphics in this game is that some of the characters are portrayed by live actors in cut scenes. They were not bad but it felt like they could have done more with CGI models rather than the actors being filmed on green screens, using CGI backgrounds. It made for bland effects.\n\nThe campaign for this sequel seemed like it could have been more of a side mission that would be play throughout different part of the first Alan Wake as you basically play the same 5 levels over and over, with the narrator for The Scary Door helping you relive the nightmare over again. The maps generally stay the same, though some parts of the levels do change slightly but most objects can be found in the same spot every time. For me, I found no replay value in this part of the game once I beat it.\n\nTo counter for the repetitiously repetitious campaign repetition, they threw in some wave based shooter survival maps they call 'Arcade Mode.' You get a couple different levels and luckily they are outside of the campaign maps. It gives this a little extra value but after finishing those, American Nightmare now sits in my "completed" archives in the cloud with Alan Wake.\n\nI also found the demented and sick humor included on every tv screen in the game mildly amusing but I quickly lost intrest. They were not as well done, lacked the satire, nor did they have the variety as in the first game.\n\nAmerican Nightmare is great third person shooter outside of the small disappointments.

The story is also really short, it will only take around 5 hours to finish the game.\nThe game itself is much more action orientated than the original, yet there seems to be fewer enemies encounters than that game had.\nOverall the sound design is good and if you enjoyed it in the first game you will enjoy it here.\nThe game’s cut scenes are interesting, because a real actor portray both, Alan himself and Mr Scratch.\nThe graphics are not bad, there has been a definite improvement to the engine since the original Alan Wake.\nBesides of the Story mode there is also the Arcade Mode. It is a survival mode where wave after wave of enemies are sent for you until the timer runs out and the sun rises. There are 5 different maps, each repeated with a nightmare mode version and are all unlocked by gaining stars for the previous levels completed.\nAll in all, Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is a not a bad game. Overall it is an enjoyable game but disappointing compared to the orginal Alan Wake.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 7/10\nAtmosphere 7/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","February 25, 2014","true","8.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

It explains some of the questions left at the end of the main game and expands a bit on the wholle story, making whorthwhile to people who enjoyed the first game. Everyone else will still be able to sink into a pretty nifty combat system with the use of light at it's core.\n\nThis game does focuses much more on combat than it's predecessor too, with a few new enemy types and a lot more weapons. Whether or not this is positive, it will depend of the person playing the game.\n\nIt's also a pretty short experience, the main story breezing throught in just about 4 hours (with the incremented value of running arround looking for collectibles), and there's really no reason to repeat the game... It does however offer an Arcade mode, consisting of a handfull of unlockable levels where you have to survive for 10 minutes. There's a total of 10 of these (5 being "original" and the 5 other's being just harder versions of the same maps).\n\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable experience that offers a good atmosphere and combat with the powerfull writing Remedy has gotten us used to.

Sadly it doesn't work well.\n\nThe main problem being the limited setting, gone is superbly realised setting of Bright Falls from the original and in it’s place is the desert town of Night Springs. There are only three small sections to explore and you're forced to replay through each section three times as the story repeats itself, it's a cheap trick at extending the running time.\n\nTo compound this the settings aren't that interesting, sure they look pretty but by removing Alan Wake from the cold and dark forest setting from the original it loses something. The supporting cast don't help as well, three new characters, one in each location, they are badly voiced acted and don't fit in with the Alan Wake universe.\n\nFinally the last disappointment comes in the shape of the main antagonist, Mr Scratch. Alluded to in the original he makes his appearance and then proceeds to do very little.\n\nThere are a few positives to the single player campaign. It's short enough so it doesn't over stay it's welcome and it's nice to hear the updates on characters from the original game through the use of the radios and televisions.\n\nThey've also improved the controls and animations so the fighting and general movement isn't as clunky as before and they've added an array of new enemies to fight, some of these are nice additions.\n\nThe second part to American Nightmare is the new action mode, eight or so maps where you have to hold off waves of enemies for ten minutes or so until it is dawn. It's a survivor gametype and it plays quite nicely, however it doesn't really belong in the Alan Wake universe which was rich on story and setting. It feels tacked on and as though it belongs to another game.\n\nSo if you have the original Alan Wake and enjoyed it there isn't much to recommend here and if you haven't played the original Alan Wake avoid this follow up at all costs and play  the far superior original.","July 6, 2013","false","9.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

The story was compelling, the characters were original, and the gameplay was quite inventive. If you're looking for these things in 'American Nightmare', I say: look elsewhere, or simply replay 'Alan Wake'. In this sequel, you follow Alan through a series of dreamlike sequences, and fans of the Jake Gyllenhaal films 'Donnie Darko' or 'Enemy' will be familiar with the ground covered in this game. Unsurprisingly, repeating and attempting to rewrite reality isn't quite as fun in videogame form, and so 'American Nightmare' very quickly degenerates into several hours of mindless repetition. The handful of characters accompanying Alan Wake in this game are incredibly uninteresting, and so the dialogue scenes really aren't worth sitting through. The developers seem to attempt livening the game up with a number of additions in the weapon and enemy departments, but these, again, aren't anything special. I'd only recommend this to: (a) people who've replayed 'Alan Wake' dozens of times, and are lifelong devotees of the character, and (b) people who spot this game massively reduced (i.e. £1 or less).","September 1, 2015","false","3.8"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","30","45","0","0"

(The game takes place in an episode of Night Springs written by Alan Wake)\n\nFirst of all, the game is way easier and provides you ammo refills every 100m so you never really need to conserve ammo, except maybe at the end of the game. The spooky aspect is gone all together, making the game more action oriented, with ALOT of combat. The game is basically the same campaign 3 times (because you're in a time loop) but it manages to mix it up somewhat, even though it gets repetitive. The dialogue is less appealing than in the original and sometimes the character models of the NPC's you meet are really ugly. Lastly, the flashlight is now godly: it recharges almost instantly and you barely ever have to pop in other batteries.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend this game if you really want to play everything from the Alan Wake series. The game stands fine on it's own, but with the weight of the first one, American Nightmare delivered something completely different, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Now Alan must confront himself with the Psychotic Mr Scratch, which is trying to bring the darkness out and spread it in the world... Between a murder and a torture.\n\nThe premise is solid and the gameplay seems improved, but this is all a mask on a product which seems made with short time, minor inspiration and different purposes. This leads to a "sequel" which is not a sequel (remedy stated this is more like a spinoff), with a lack of atmosphere as in the original title, underdeveloped valid ideas and a gameplay improved and ruined at the same time.\nThe atmosphere and the gameplay are two elements really close as even though the story takes place always by night in unpopulated areas, with bad or no illumination the locations are not... interesting. They have nothing to do with the charm of Bright Falls, the landscapes, the detailed ambiences. Of course few places or elements are very interesting and detailed, but in its entirety it doesn't even compare with Alan Wake.\nThe Gameplay doesn't help much. They Have added more weapons unlockable with collectible manuscripts, but the worst part is the Ammo Box... A self regenerating ammo box. This seems like the same evolution that affected the Resident Evil Saga, so you had to survive with few bullets and a bunch of weapons with a character that can barely run, and now Alan Wake can Magically Run three times longer before spitting a lung, he can easily get his hands on an arsenal and the game almost throws ammo box at him... Nope. Even though I'm quite glad Alan Can Run longer (It was really frustrating in the Original Game), and I'm glad they've replaced the six-shoots revolver with an automatic gun... I mean, seriously? A gun with six bullets to be reloaded one by one? Come on... (Don't misunderstand me, I understand it was meant to give the game a Survival gameplay, it's just me hating that kind of guns...).\nAnd once again For both the atmosphere and the gameplay, you will visit three relatively small locations for three times... And every time it will take you less to complete each locations. It took me 4 hours and I was even looking for collectibles...\nThere's also an arcade mode which is nothing more than an arena with hordes of takensattacking you. I don't even know why I'm bothering to mention it...\nThe only positive note is the idea behind the game and the character of Mr Scratch. Just look at the TVs you can find around the locations, you'll see his "messages" for Alan. Not to mention the Trailers With Mr Scratch, Ilkka Villi has done a really great interpretation. Too bad the character wasn't developed further than what you see in those videos, which is a serious waste...\nThe other and last positive note in the game is the music... Nevermind, I eat it back, because it features a new track from the "old Gods of Asgard", from Poets of The Fall (Actually the same Guys XD) and another track, "Club Foot" from Kasabian... And Even though I adore them that's everything good the soundtrack has to offer, which for me is not enough. There's no ominous music, the good tracks are wasted in Climaxing Action scenes which actually lasted 10 seconds on top and there's no credit song worth listening as in the Original Title.\nWhat can I say, Alan Wake's American Nightmare isn't a very bad game, it had some good potential but some gameplay choices altered the spirit of the Original Alan Wake and the game itself looks rushed without any detailed developing in locations, characters or story. So all in all it's not a bad game actually, but a sequel/spinoff, call it whatever you want, which unfortunately doesn't really compare to the Original Alan Wake, and really this is a pity as I really loved it.\n\n\n+++PROs+++ MR SCRATCH. I don't know how to put it. Ilkka Villi Simply did an awesome interpretation of Alan Wake's psychotic doppelganger. Simply awesome.\nMUSIC. Kasabian's track really fits into the mood of the events and poets of the fall gave a couple of other great tracks.---CONs--- REPETITIVENESS. The game takes place in three locations which you will visit for three times, doing almost the same things. It has a reason for that but it really affects the gameplay as it makes things easier and more predictable.\nGAMEPLAY. I'm almost sure they planned improvements as increased stamina, more weapons and excessive amount of ammos to give more fun and action to the game, which to me resulted in a more boring gameplay with almost every survival element almost disappeared.\nSHORT. There is not enough of anything: the game itself lasts 4 hours at best. The awesome interpretation of a stronger villain such as Mr Scratch is simply confined in cutscenes or in the videos seen in the TVs around the maps. The Soundtrack is made of just three tracks and even though they're awesome they're still just three songs. There are not enough bullets... No wait, there actually are all the bullets you want...","April 12","false","9.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

So you should definitely play the original first, because of spoilers and because that is still better.\nBut is Nightmare good as well? I'd say yes, but for different reasons than the original. Where Alan Wake had a story of horror, confusion and mystery, in Nightmare this is simply not possible anymore, since the player (or at least the Protagonist Alan) already knows what is behind it all. So the game has to go into a different direction.\nNightmare has a good and fun combat system, great soundtrack (that raises some of the moments in the game to nothing short of awesome), an interesting story that fully embraces the new possibilities now that Alan knows what is going on, and most importantly one of the best villains in Video Game history: Mr. Scratch. Said villain appears on screen only as a real human played by an actor, who does a marvellous job at looking like the perfect psycho killer. With superpowers. And an army of unholy monsters.\n\nAdmittedly, the game's world is not that large and the game doesn't take that long to complete (except if you really like the combat and get into the arcade mode), but if you happen to get it on sale, for say under 5 bucks, you should give it a try, especially if you liked the original.","December 30, 2014","true","5.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

While it can be played as a standalone, there are many references to characters and stories from the original that help to enrich the story throughout the game.\n\nNo longer is Alan Wake in the beautiful rustic backdrop of the pacific northwest, this time he finds himself in the arid deserts of Arizona. With a new western theme, the game remains true to itself by using the same fighting techniques and graphic qualities as the first game, but with slight tweaks and updates that breathe a new life into the game. Collecting manuscripts to unlock weapons, more dialogue options for NPCs, and containers that give max ammo/batteries, for example.\n\nLike the first game, this game has many interesting cut scenes that really add to the story, and the use of real actors is a nice touch as well. Television recordings and radio broadcasts help create a backdrop for the other characters in Alan’s old life, telling their current stories alongside his own.\n\nThere is also an Arcade Mode for those who wish to challenge themselves, or for those who just want to bash in some taken skulls.\n\nFor a short(er) game, I found the story to be intriguing and unique.  However, as I progressed further into the game I felt like the gameplay got a little repetitive and the enemies became more annoying than challenging. The fact that there are only three locations to explore, and that you return to them repeatedly, was disappointing. I was expecting more unique and exciting locations much like the original had offered.\n\nMy overall score for the game: 7/10. Recommended for any fans of the series or anyone looking for a short supernatural shooter with both mystery and intrigue.\n","April 25","true","10.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Because of that, Alan Wake's American Nightmare is a definite step back from the original, and unless you really liked the combat of Alan Wake, to the extent you'd play a mediocre game just to have a more refined version of said combat, then don't bother with Alan Wake's American Nightmare.\n\nThe game take place at an indeterminate time after Alan's been stuck in Cauldron Lake, he escapes by rewriting reality, and he ends up in Night Springs. It turns out Alan is some "Champion of Light", trying to defeat the "Herald of Darkness"... who the hell wrote this ♥♥♥♥? This isn't Alan Wake, it's some weird pseudo-fantasy cliched bullcrap. Anyway, he's looking for his doppleganger, Mr Scratch, who is the Herald of Darkness, and seeks to destroy him. Along they way he meets secondary characters who seems to completely oblivious to everything that's happening, and just sorta wait for ♥♥♥♥ to go wrong.\n\nEventually they do, and Alan goes to a new version of reality where he didn't ♥♥♥♥ up. Rinse and repeat a few times until Fin. The story is uninteresting and unnessarily padded, with the same sequence of events happening 3 times over. The villain is just a ♥♥♥♥ version of Alan Wake. He's not even like some evil destroyer of worlds, or some Orange/Blue Morality Nethergod or something; he's just slightly more dickish Alan Wake.\n\nAside from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot, combat in the game has been changed a bit.

The game was okay, had an intresting plot, tons more weapons, spiders, taken that look even worse than in Alan Wake etc. American Nightmare unlike the first game is not a survival horror game, its more an action based game. The plot takes place in the popular tv show "Night Springs" in an epsode written by Alan himself were the champion of light (Alan) must defeat the herald of darkness (His Evil Twin Mr Scratch). The game takes place in three places: The Motel/Rest Stop, The Observatory and The Drive-in Theater and upon reaching the end of the Drive-in Theater Mr Scratch sends Alan back to the start meaning you have to play through the game again with small differences, this happens twice, in other words, there are Three Areas and Three time loops. The third loop adds the giant, long story short they're scary. In my opinion the game was mostly good but I didn't like the weapon unlock system because they required pages which I sucked at finding.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/202750/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: The familiar flashlight-shooter horror game makes a comeback but demoted to an action shooter.\n\nAlan Wake is back. This time around he's seasoned and armed to the teeth, steeled by the Dark Place he has been trapped since last time. Consequently, American Nightmare builds heavily on the original game's story. If you haven't played it expect to be confused by what's going on. In fact I'd recommend one to play (link!) Alan Wake before American Nightmare to be able to understand the story, if only because of the nice references.\n\nHaving played the original game ensures that you will fully understand the story. Alan Wake is very literally the superhero of his own story, somehow constantly knowing what to do when the player is left perplexed by all the peculiar events. In the story Alan is trapped in the Dark Place and wants to escape. He has a plan that is revealed bit by bit.\n\nThe ominous Mr. Scratch, introduced briefly in Alan Wake, has become the villain, a malicious manifestation of The Dark Presence. He will appear from time to time in random TV screens to taunt Alan. None of the rest of the characters make come-backs (well, unless you count the radio show host). In fact, there are only three other characters to interact with. Their acting feels too cheesy and out-of-place, and it's weird anyway that there are so few people around.\n\nThe play area is also lot smaller than in Alan Wake: only three (albeit rather big) maps contain the whole story in nine chapters that slyly recycle the same areas. While it makes sense for the story, it makes one think that it was done so because of low budget.\n\nThe radio shows and Alan's notes are still there and they are cool and I felt they were approximately of the same quality as in Alan Wake. Graphics and sound are similar quality to the original.\n\nAlan's confidence actually eats the atmosphere: the ominous mood of the original Alan Wake is almost completely missing. The Taken appear out of no-where but there's nothing building up tension, and usually they are easy to dispatch because there's ammo and supplies basically everywhere.\n\nAmerican Nightmare is then sort of an action version of Alan Wake: the Taken (i.e. the enemies) are more aggressive and numerous, and there are several new weapons from crossbows to automatic shotguns. A few more enemy types have been introduced, some of which need to be dispatched without light. They are all fine additions to the enemy roster.\n\nTo the joy of the lovers of the curious combat system an Arcade mode has been included. In the Arcade mode you have to survive 10 minutes of Taken waves of increasing strength. You build up a combo multiplier by successful kills and not getting hit and try to reach as high a score as possible. For a change, it gets fairly difficult and it's easy to run out of ammo. Your skills will be tested especially in the Nightmare mode, in which there are no longer separate waves or pauses: instead the Taken appear continuously making the action very intense.\n\nMuch shorter than Alan Wake, the story lasts just a few hours and I managed to even get all the achievements without guides in 10 and 1/2 hours. The story has practically no replay value unless you missed some of the notes (in which case you can choose to replay individual chapters). Arcade mode has some interesting challenge achievements and there you can fight for the highest place on the global leaderboards if that's your thing.\n\nI think American Nightmare is an okay sequel but it pales in comparison with the original. Get it if you liked Alan Wake but wait for a sale.","September 6, 2015","true","11.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milkshaxe/recommended/202750/","milkshaxe","Milkshaxe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milkshaxe/","89 products in account","Not bad, Remedy\nAlright, so this review might be a little biased due to the fact that I loved Alan Wake and am currently foaming at the mouth because of the new emergence of details on there possible being an Alan Wake 2 in development very soon. However, I'll try to keep it fair.\n\nIf you have never played Alan Wake, you will most likely quit this game after 5 minutes, then come back and fall in love with it. That's what happened to me with the first Alan Wake game. However, there are some notable differences between American Nightmare and the first Alan Wake. For instance, you will never struggle to find ammo or batteries for your flashlight in this game. And if you do, you're doing it wrong. Remedy set out to make this short semi-sequel of Alan Wake with more of an arcade feeling than the previous game. Also, the entire campaign takes place in an episode of an in-game fictional TV show called Night Springs, which is playing on a TV in a hotel room that Alan's friend Barry is asleep in. This is unlike Alan Wake because Alan Wake had 5 "episodes" of gameplay if I remember correctly. Also, there was no true narrator in Alan Wake. There is in this game, and the narrator even gives Alan a cool nickname: The Champion of Light. And Alan's alternate, dark personality, Mr. Scratch, is coined as the Herald of Darkness. Basically, the entire goal of the campaign is to stop Mr. Scratch from turning the world into the dark place he wants it to be. His ultimate goal is to stop the sun from ever rising again. As the champion of light, you set out on a mission against the dark side of yourself to ensure that the sun indeed does rise and the world can be restored to its natural self.\n\nMoving on to gameplay\n\nThe gameplay mimics the exact same style of action as the first Alan Wake. You are Alan, a horror-crime genre writer, armed with a flashlight, and any guns, flares, and flashbang grenades you can find. When you encounter a Taken individual (the poor souls taken by the darkness of Mr. Scratch), you have to rid them of the darkness before you can deal any true damage to them. This is done by focusing your flashlight on them, throwing a flash grenade at them, or putting a flare down/waiting for the unfocused ray of your flashlight to break the darkness. The game is filled with many jumpscares, much like the original Alan Wake. You may find yourself looking over your own shoudler in real life after you turn around and there's a lumberjack with a sickle stalking you from two feet behind. When in doubt, throw whatever throwable item you have equipped; it will solve a lot of problems in your life. The plot twists within the story are also very interesting. I won't spoil anything of course, but let's just say you'll find yourself in the same place more than once.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to everyone, but especially to people who have played Alan Wake or just want to try something different from the meta of the modern video game industry. This game features a lot of the concepts that were supposed to be/will be in Alan Wake 2 (incase anyone other than me is excited about that). I give it a 9/10, but only because it honestly is not challenging if you have played the original Alan Wake. I might have died 2-3 times in 7 hours of gameplay with completion of the story. You should also check out the arcade game mode if you actually enjoy the different combat style that this game features, like me. Buy it and play it. But don't be surprised if you beat the story in 5 hours.\n\n9/10 stars\nUnique combat style\nTV show simulation setting\nPlot twist after plot twist\nJUMP SCARES!\nGet it","December 10, 2015","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I really do like the utter improvements to flashing and shooting american nightmare brought out, that’s everything I want and need from a sequel, and it’s extremely fun to play. these are great things to say about game, so keep that to heart, when I say that’s largely where the compliments stop.\n\nalan wake was not carefully written. it’s endearing in its transparent absurdity. you know this so-called famous writer has printed lines as good as a high schooler in creative writing and it’s ok because he’s a facsimile, he’s a failed writer, he’s the embodiment of a writer - but maybe he’s not actually good at it. those are excuses and I’m totally sure not intentions, however, they work real nicely justifying the original alan wake. american nightmare is one-third the length of alan wake and tries to be just as high concept, it tries to conclude every loose end left open prior, and it takes its writing just as seriously. it doesn’t work, there’s no way it could work, and there’s nothing admirable about it trying so desperately. no, remedy was wrong to begin with. considering the parameters of a much smaller game, concessions have to made. when you transplant a large structure into the smaller product resulting of the concessions, you nullify the concessions completely, and create something that can only be inferior. embracing a new direction is how you subsist on a new field. if the container is smaller, it can’t be filled with the same amount of liquid.\n\nwhat grinds me is that every theme covered in american nightmare is identical to the themes in alan wake. it doesn’t consider the consequences, besides one exchange with the scientist lady, nor does it expand on obvious horizons. it puerilely restates everything explored in alan wake with one difference: alan wake has adopted a kind of god or hero complex. I guess he has to, the way the narrative is phrased around a champion of light and a herald of darkness, and it doesn’t really contradict alan wake’s character progression. what it does though is invalidate all of its themes; doubt, darkness, and mystery have no room to breathe in front of a main character who just shrugs his shoulders and cleans it all up. in the length allotted to american nightmare, it’s impossible to explore the duality, the clash of light and darkness, the external phenomenon of a previously internal conflict. what personal ugliness alan wake struggled against in the original game falls flat in its face with alan wake overcoming all of it and the game insisting it’s still there.\n\namerican nightmare takes place in arizona, instead of washington. the lush and beautiful forested levels are replaced with arid fields. the three levels are big and open, but they’re empty. encounters only and predictably happen when you approach objectives. they’re exclusively disorganized swarms. every objective is dumb and arbitrary and never does let you just clear checkpoints; clear a level. granted, it doesn't have to operate that way, but if all you can construct is swarms of enemies, then an orthodox approach would have been a better fit. there’s still an attention to detail and craftsmanship in the level design, so while they aren’t conventionally beautiful, I still think they’re good levels. it doesn’t excuse what I’ve made an effort not to mention until now. alan wake is stuck in a time loop. what does that mean? it means the ultimate filler. it means playing the same three levels three times doing variations of the same objectives. I wish this was a joke, some kind of metagaming satire about how menial completion can be in a single player campaign, and it is, because it isn’t. even if it has good level design, it has tiring and inexcusable level design, because it repeated entire blocks of content unashamedly, arrogantly, pompously. saying something like, alan wake’s determination and endurance doesn’t waver in the face of futility, or whatever contextualized bull, which doesn’t really match the player psychology of being tired of remedy’s crap. repeating levels, repeating encounters, repeating objectives, repeating story themes. it’s lazy and indefensible, no matter how novel it’s tries to be, it’s crap design.\n\nalan wake’s american nightmare is fun to play. it’s only three hours long, so it’s truthfully worth playing. it’s competent enough as game even if it’s surface level and unambitious. I love alan wake’s character. he’s a lovable d-bag with good intentions and a heart of gold. also, he’s a go-getting sharp featured writer, just like I am a handsome, entirely coolheaded writer-man as well. even if I didn’t like anything other than the game’s sensations, I do believe they are enough to carry the game. if you genuinely enjoyed the first game then you’ll be the most disappointed by american nightmare, yet ironically, I think that’s the only audience for this game. american nightmare can only be played as a disappointment. that’s interesting in itself, how its own existence is a mockery, and I find it odd none of this is grudging. it’s nice to play a good game that is trying to be deep, even if it can’t do anything right on a deeper level, as long as it did right on the things that matter. it’s something nothing wants to be and that’s why it functions curiously even if it's ineffective.","June 8, 2014","true","4.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'd call AN a spin-off rather than a sequel to Alan Wake given its slightly brighter color palette and more action-oriented gameplay. The story, as well, while having some connections to the original it doesn't have the same amount of effort put into it and seems to only be there so that there's something to call a story.\n\nHowever, the game itself is not delluding itself that it's something that it's not. I feel this was done consciously to give Alan Wake fans a quick fix of what they liked while I suspect a sequel is in the works. But therein lies the game's biggest caveat: It's a game for Alan Wake fans. People coming into the series with American Nightmare will find themselves confused and lacking valuable backstory information, no matter the game's good intentions and attempts to bring everyone up to speed.\n\nThe graphics are doing new and interesting things with color and lighting in this new western desert setting as opposed to the gray and blue of the Rocky Mountains' nights in the previous game, but the soundtrack seems to fall short this time, lacking the storyline integration that made the first one great.\n\nAll in all in spite of all this I had fun with Alan Wake's American Nightmare and I'm giving it a thumbs up, but with a footnote: For fans of the series.","January 17, 2015","true","10.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Two years have passed and Alan Wake is still missing! The story again is written and plays out as it does in Alan Wake but this time the horror story that comes to life is about Alan Wakes doppleganger, a warped and twisted version of himself known only as Mr. Scratch. As this is Alans own story he must battle though the Arizona desert and rewrite reality to stop his doppleganger from re-entering reality as Alan Wake and to prevent himself from being trapped in the darkness forever!\n\nThe story is about stopping your nemesis but how the story progresses is quite different. To defeat Mr. Scratch you must gather the whole storyline (manuscript pages) by revisiting parts of the story "Déjà vu" and in each instance you will go back in time until you find the correct pieces of the story and join them together. As Mr. Scratch has warped reality he will send you back in time to discourage you from finding the pieces!\n\nGameplay is identical to the orignal except for a few new weapons and of course SPIDERS! YES ♥♥♥♥ING TAKEN SPIDERS!\n\nPros:\n-Light as a weapon\n-Explains some backstories in it like how Alice and Barry are doing etc etc\n-Like its successor distrubing and horrifying\n-Narration takes a different approach similar to how it is done in The Twilight Zone\n-The arcade feature is lots of fun :P\n-Great looking game\n\nCons:\n-The game is pretty short. a whole universe of American Nightmare would've been good\n-Gameplay is pretty linear right at the start and the fact you have to revisit parts of the game although cool can be boring!\n\nBut a crtitical success like its predecessor, ticks all my boxes! 10 Foxes out of 10 foxes!","August 31, 2014","true","12.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Most of the gameplay is the same, but the combat controls are tightened up nicely to the point where this instance of the game is the best in the series.\n\nThe best part of this game is that is has some fun with the premise and makes for an interesting twist which doesn't overstay its welcome. It's rather short - maybe 4 hours - but still well worth having. Ideally, you'd pick it up in a Franchise pack with the original game, but if you're picking it up independently, it's well worth having.

American Nightmare has the same interesting mechanics, but the story is not nearly as well done, and the fact that you basically repeat the same thing multiple times is disappointing.

The weapon system is fun, making you collect manuscript pages to unlock new guns. The enemies are also new, improving on the plain minions from the previous installments. They introduce an all new Arcade Mode as well, and it provides entertainment for those that have finished the Main Story. Plus the game improves on the graphics, looking better than ever.\n\nBut, there are some bad things. The story is extremely short, especially taking into account you go to the same areas 3 times. Yes, it is a part of the story, but they should've considered making it more interesting. Increasing the difficulty each time isn't going to win you Game of the Year. The story in itself gets pretty boring. Fans of Alan Wake will enjoy it more, but it just doesn't pull you in. It doesn't do very much to keep your interest, relying on the gamer to finish the game just because they paid money for it, and they should get their money's worth. The new characters (everyone except Alan) are not that enticing either; they don't make you sympathize/get attached to them. And finally, the game is easy. I beat the game in three hours. That's just unprofessional.\n\nIt may sound like I hate the game, but I don't. The story is an episode of Night Springs that Alan wrote, putting Mr. Wake in a time loop set by his dark side. Alan must perfect everything in order to defeat his evil self, or be sent back in time to relive the defeat all over again, until he suceeds. The ending is decent, and it isn't that bad of a story overall. But it fails to make an impression that rivals the previous game or any other best seller. There is some replay value, but not much. The Arcade Mode is pretty much the only reason to go back to the game.\n\nIn summary, this game is for fans of Alan Wake. So make sure you've played that one first.

Budgeted Mediocre Action Schlock Which Is Missing That Extra Something.Genre: Third Person Psychological Horror Thriller Shooter.\nDeveloped and Published by: Remedy Entertainment (on PC).\nPlatforms: Windows, Xbox 360.\nCopy purchased by myself in a Humble BundleRead the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\n\nPreamble\nI had originally played American Nightmare after having finished Alan Wake in May of 2013. However, I was getting pretty tired of the combat system and seeing it repeated without a lot of variety didn’t do much for me at the time. The story’s changed tone didn’t help either. Back then, all I had finished was the first cycle of levels and decided to quit it early. I did review both Alan Wake and American Nightmare then too, where I slamming AN for being a subpar experience. It’s a mistake I’m not proud of but I’m glad to correct it now. So, I’ve completed this nightmare and have my complete thoughts on it. Admittedly, the same issues I had with it back then haven’t changed much. Except for the combat I suppose. This is another review where you have to ignore the Steam rating and read the words to find out my overall feelings for it.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nAlan Wake: American Nightmare is the semi-sequel standalone that Remedy published several years after the release of the original Alan Wake. Released after they stopped working on Alan Wake 2, AN was meant to take the ideas and setting that they had crafted for a demo of AW2 and publish something out of it. When it had become clear to Remedy that the time wasn’t right for a sequel, American Nightmare was created instead while the studio went to its other announced projects. Is this the last word for the Alan Wake series? That seems to be the indication so far but it's entirely possible that Remedy could return to the series. I hope they do because this nightmare ends the series on a rather sour note.\n\nAmerican Nightmare plays out like a schlocky episode of the Twilight Zone. Alan Wake is fighting against a new threat from the darkness, Mr. Scratch who looks and sounds like him. Alan finds himself in Spring Falls (AZ) where things don’t seem quite right, he’s being unusually stalwart and the Scratch is over-the-top silly. There’s also this constant narration from a guy that sounds like the narrator from the Twilight Zone who uses the pronoun game way too much. Alan has to figure out what’s going on in order to defeat the trap set by Mr. Scratch.\n\nCombat Mechanics and the Psychological Tension\nAmerican Nightmare lacks a lot of what made the game so tense and didn’t replace it with anything outside of a wider variety of weapons and enemies. Gone are the claustrophobic battles and limited ammunition. Ammo can be found all over these new wide-open spaces. Alan has clearly embraced his role as a warrior of light and I’m ok with that. However, the side effect of this embracing is that the tension of the previous game has been largely muted and it plays out like a fairly standard third person shooter. The major change to combat is the new weapons you can use. Assault rifles, combat shotguns, SMGs and hunting bows just to name a few. They work and sound reasonably good, if a little uninspired. They don’t really add anything to change the combat which is a little disappointing. I mean, we’re talking about a battle between light and darkness. I would have loved to see weapons that could use light or change the battlefield in some way. Instead, light weapons are still the flares, flaregun and flashbang grenades as before. The same tactic of shining a light on the taken till the darkness is gone and opening fire remains. A slightly strange change to the mechanics is that simply shining an unfocused flashlight on taken doesn’t peel away the darkness like it did before. You have to focus the flashlight on each and every one of them. This doesn’t really change the tempo of combat all that much but I felt it was worth noting.\n\nThe Schlocky Story\nThe story plays out after the events of Alan Wake. Alan finds himself in the town of Bright Falls, AZ, in a world where his writing has power. He finds himself fighting against his evil counterpart: Mr Scratch. Who looks and sounds exactly like him except that he’s evil. Mr Scratch has trapped Alan in a time loop with the intent of wearing him down and eventually defeating him. Thereby allowing Mr Scratch to take over his life in the real world. Worse, Alan lost some of his memories and the key to defeating Mr Scratch once and for all. Alan must survive in the trap long enough to piece together a message he sent to himself that will allow him to set a deadly trap for Mr Scratch instead. Which the trap is killing him at a movie theater when the right conditions are met. Once that’s done, Alan apparently is reunited with his wife, Alice Wake. Where the two share a hug and kiss and the story ends. It’s actually kind of anticlimactic.\n\nPC Settings\nAlan Wake goes for a fairly realistic style that’s less punctuated with the bright lights and dark shadows of the previous title. However, instead of animated in-game cutscenes that the original title did, they go with live-action cutscenes every time Alan Wake and Mr. Scratch “interact”. It’s weird to see it used and I’m not convinced it works. I’m also not convinced by the setting of Arizona’s desert, as it feels way too bare in contrast to the Pacific Northwest’s forested and hilly areas. Side note, there are some awkward animations with facial expressions and body movement that’s bizarre to watch when the characters converse. It’s not enough to ruin the experience but it looks really dated by current standards.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAmerican Nightmare has some serious problems that seem to stem from its limited budget. It’s missing a lot of what made Alan Wake a good experience, that underlying current of tension is all but gone. The story, writing and acting is schlocky as hell. What some of the characters say sounds weird and Alan Wake seems to be indifferent to most of what’s going on around him. Furthermore, Mr. Scratch fails to be an interesting villain, feeling like a side character most of the time. Probably the most egregious issue is the game making the player repeat the same levels three times. While they don’t have you repeat the exact same dialogues and actions, the repetition is still there and it isn’t interesting. Combat does get some changes but most of it is the inclusion of high powered weapons. Otherwise, fights are mostly set in big open areas where enemies can be seen for miles. It loses the tension fights had in AW and settles for a mostly mediocre third person shooter. Should you pick it up? I can’t decide. There’s nothing actually wrong with AN from a story or game mechanics perspective, it’s just not as good as Alan Wake. There are better titles out there worth checking out in comparison. So, my suggestion would be to think on what I’ve said and see if the change in tone is worth checking out or not.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\nA Paladin's Review: Alan Wake","October 17, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Alan is stuck in a loop in time due to Mr. Scratch rewinding back time every time you get close to defeating him.\n\nYou'll only be playing through three different areas, sounds like it would be extremely short right? Well, it is. Remedy padded the game at an attempt to make it longer by making you replay those three areas NINE times total. Why nine times you're asking, right? Because each time you change something in each area and this is ultimately how you defeat Mr. Scratch.\n\nThe game is far from bad, but it does suffer from repetition. There's not many weapons to use, ammo is scattered all over each area so there's never really any intense moments.  The game can get intense when Taken gang up on you, but it's never that difficult to dodge their attacks and even if they do get close to you all you got to do is shine your light on them and they'll back off.\n\nI recommend the game if you liked the previous game, otherwise you'll have a bad time with American Nightmare.","October 21, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Suffice to say, running from enemies doesn't have much sense anymore. The more variability with the Taken does so little to makes things harder, unfortunately\nSecond, the game is basically about three distinct locations that you have to visit thrice each. While I kind of expect to revisit levels in roleplaying and open world games, I don't like doing so in action adventures and horror titles. While this design is perfect, storywise, it can't help but to feel annoying and tiresome\nThe new arcade mode is basically a hold the line mode against endless waves of Taken and nothing more. It's a quest to unlock all the available maps and reaching the highest score possible\nTherefore I consider Alan Wake's American Nightmare a weaker expansion for the original game, but quite fair, given its price","September 3, 2013","false","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then this might be the game for you.\n\nOnce again you take on the role of Alan Wake and his fight against the encroaching all powerful darkness. Blow away every evil being that wonders into your crosshairs using a large array of weapons, one that would make any gun enthusiast dance with glee. My favourite happened to be the nail gun, simple but deadly. Also the unique ability to use the beam from your flashlight to weaken your foes is back once again, something that I really enjoyed from the original.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the first title but this time it has a more arcady feel to it, especially with a score attack mode running parallel to the main story. It does add a lot of gameplay value but can be very repetitive continually killing the same sets of enemies over and over again.\n\nAs for the story itself, it carries the same dark humour as many other of Remedies titles even using the Twilight zone styled Night Springs as the main way to convey the story. The game is not overly long and does feel repetitive in nature, mainly due to using the same levels over and over but given the time bending storyline that is not surprising. I didn’t get bored at all and had a real desire to find out what happened to our hero in the end and whether or not he would have his happy ending.\n\nIf you have played and liked the original then this is a must buy especially if on sale, if not just to complete the story arc from the first game. If you are new to the series don’t start with this one, but buy the original as it is a phenomenal game.\n\nHave Fun ^_^\n","May 19, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After i finished Alan Wake (DLC also) i wanted to try that game .. my first impressions, HUD was wierd (HP bar ? what's wrong ..) but ok i started playing was not bad after one thing .. all pages are marked on your minimap ... seriously ? in Alan Wake it was hidden and what here ? .... second thing there are 3 maps .. YES 3 that u play 3 times EACH third thing .. well i don't think that Alan Wake need THAT many weapons .. because this supposed to be ACTION/THRILLER not a TPS .. and now some details. Why just why in this game the best weapon is (WAIT FOR IT ........) a crossbow .. so what .. bolts for shadows are like pins and garlic for vampires ? seriously that is sick ... and soundtrack .. well maybe i'm not fan of that type of music but for me in Alan Wake it was totally BETTER than in this .. you will also ask me why i don't said about storyline ? well because this don't exist for me in this game .. If you want to try this game, well i will just recommend to see ending of that game and that's all, and just wait for Alan Wake 2 and have hope that Alan Wake 2 will be better than THAT.","January 9, 2014","false","2.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","2"

I was definitely less impressed with the overall game. It seemed cobbled together, with a lot less exploration and character development. It does smoothly resume the story however, it's just not as good. Alan is stuck in a time loop that repeats itself 3 times throughout the game. There's only 3 maps in the game. The motel, the observatory, and the drive in cinema. I was disappointed by this, as I was hoping for the continuous exploration like the first game. There were no driveable vehicles, and a lot less running through the woods to get to the next area. It's all narrated and way less decision making.\n\nThere's still the "Night Springs" TV show, but there's also Alan's... doppelganger that makes dramatic appearances on the TV. There's also still the same Pat Maine slowly revealing the story through the radio. There's a lot less dialogue and interactions Alan has with other characters.\n\nThe game has a few combat tweaks, like the default unboosted flashlight doesn't harm the Taken. I had to boost it constantly but it recharges almost instantly making it almost more effective. I think I used 1 battery the whole game. There's a few more weapons but I still kept the pistol until I could get the double barrel sawed-off, which mows down almost any Taken in 1 shot. There's a few more types of Taken as well, and they switch up all the time. I think my favorite was the crow guys, if you hit them with the light they jump into the air and turn into a murder of crows until they coalesce back into the human form. Then I just blew them away with the sawed-off. The combat is far less challenging because every time a Taken spawns the camera pans to it, where as before Taken would spawn silently and just throw a hammer outta nowhere, or come running outta the woods with no warning.\n\nThe ending was so lame. I was pretty disappointed since I saw it coming from the first time loop. It was nice to finish the game and know that the Alan Wake series closes here.\n\nAlan Wake: 6.2\nAlan Wake's American Nightmare: 4.6","November 23, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I thought this was a nice return to form.  The gameplay is pretty combat-heavy, but I had fun with it.  You go through three different environments, three times each, which gets a bit repetitive, but they change things up just enough that it's not terrible.  Mostly it was the writing, the radio shows, the TVs and the manuscript pages littered about that really added depth and color to a fairly simple plot.

The story is so so, having you play through the same three areas three times across all the acts, which got tiring after the second time through. There's an explanation for why you do it, but seeing the same areas across 6-8 hours is disappointing. On the bright side, it is less linear than the original, but that's only if you care to search for collectibles (only manuscript pages this time around).\n\nThe new arcade mode is a welcome addition, though, which has you playing through 10 minutes as waves of Taken attack your position. Most of the maps provide one position that you can abuse if you're just looking to 3 star the levels, but that's a choice you can make so I have a hard time complaining about it.\n\nIt's not Alan Wake 2, but still worth your time if you're looking for more Alan Wake.","July 18, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Thankfully all the things that annoyed me about the original game (control being temporarily wrenched away from the player every time enemies approached was the worst) have gone from this follow-up. As a result this short episode is a much more satisfying, if brief, experience (there are only about 6 hours of main story gameplay here, although there is an arcade game tagged on, which is basically a survival mode where you’re pitted against waves of enemies). The story has an unusual, Groundhog Day structure which entails the player repeating tasks several times in an effort to defeat the main enemy, Mr Scratch. This sounds dull but it isn’t because the atmosphere and combat are enjoyable enough to remain fresh through the few hours it takes to complete. I also liked the use of FMV cutscenes, which, sadly, are a rare thing these days (it took me back to 90s -- the heyday for FMV games). Overall AWAN is an improvement on the original game. I do feel, however, that Remedy will have to come up with a stronger storyline to keep the player’s interest for a full-length campaign in AW2. 4/5","May 18, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

This game is titled "Alan Wake's American Nightmare"  This game is a pretty cool guy, being set in Arizona, it's 20% cooler than the previous title in this series, and way more better than most titles not set in Arizona.  The game feels very much like playing an old 1950s B-Movie, only without all of the Bees.  The Giant Spiders are still present, but not untill the second level.  In this game you play as Alan Wake, and are having an American Nightmare.  That is that this game assumes you failed to keep the illegals out in Tom Clancy's Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, and now there are Illegals all across America.  The Illegals have taken peoples jobs, and their dogs, and other things.  They're living in houses paid for by the government, with health care subsidies paid for by the government, and all kinds of other wrong.  Alan has to take his trusty shotgun and drive them back across the border.","July 25, 2012","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

American Nightmare is a different take on the Alan Wake formula. Gameplay-wise, it's shorter, easier and better. Alan now can run, shoot and jump, things he struggled to do before. I guess it comes with experience. AN also comes with a villain and while he's just a doppelganger, I like him because he's crazy and sexy (every woman in the game can agree with me on this one).

AN's story as it relates to AW boggled the mind, but it's still damn good in the realm of video games; more self-aware flirtations with storytelling tropes, this time more thoroughly entrenched in AW's schlocky influences.\n\nThe story's 'bout half the length of AW's, but feels far shorter due to the limited scope & # of explorable environments. 3 maps, each repeated 3 times in a time loop. I tend to hate time loop stories, but this one left a mostly pos. impression. It's reasoning is believable in the context of the story, but that doesn't stop it from occas. feeling like a sad excuse to lengthen the game. (I love the changes b/w repeats, e.g., NPCs recognizing you and starting to understand their places in the loop--esp. the scientist's 4th-wall commentary on being unable to remember anything outside of her purpose in Wake's story.)\n\nOut of room.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aquaserge/recommended/202750/","Aquaserge","Aquaserge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aquaserge/","358 products in account","A fantastic addition to the series! They take a lot of the strengths from the first game and keep them in place, but they also take a bunch of the weaknesses as well and greatly improve them. In comparison, this game is much easier than Alan Wake but I had so much fun playing it the difficulty nerf didn't really bother me. Finally there is a larger selection of weapons, but to be honest my favorites ended up being the standard issue 9mm pistol, and the crossbow, together they got the job done clean and quickly. If you are familiar with the predecessor to this game, the flash bangs and flare gun have been nerfed as well, but with a decent amount of balance. Ammo conservation isn't nearly as pertinent in this edition with the abundant and refilling ammo caches in each zone. Exploring isn't nearly as nerve racking or dangerous as well, which is a bit of a letdown.\n\n********ATTENTION: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD********\n\nThe story of this game is solid, but also unoriginal. The whole idea of a repeating day has been done a lot, but it somewhat fits in with the setting of Night Springs that the game presents. Still not 100% sure if this is just another episode, or if it actually happened. Either way, the change of setting is very welcomed and the new enemies are a nice addition. I do enjoy the idea of dealing with a doppelganger though, and Mr Scratch pulls it off VERY well, I actually really like the guy.\n\n********END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS********\n\nAs for rating, on an enjoyment level I would give this game a solid 8.5 / 10 if you are just in it for how fun the game is. If you want to be a stickler and rate the actual level of design and originality in the game, it would have to be a 7 / 10. Either way, this is still a damn good game, especially if you played Alan Wake.","February 5, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/esn1g/recommended/202750/","esn1g","Jim North","http://steamcommunity.com/id/esn1g/","429 products in account","The Good\nJust like the original game, the writing in this is absolutely top notch.  The story delves even deeper into the dizzying ramifications of being able to fictionalize and alter reality as Alan has learned to do, even while at the same time saying that trying to understand those ramifications could drive a person crazy.  And even more than the original game, it doesn't just present these ideas as part of the storyline, it actively uses them as part of the gameplay as Alan works to change and effect everything around him in order to defeat his new nemesis Mr. Scratch and work out a solution to his situation that leaves things better rather than worse off.\n\nAnd speaking of new nemesis Mr. Scratch, ho-lee crap is he a good villain.  Major props have to be given to both Iikka Villi and Matthew Porretta for pulling double duty, combining their powers to be the body and voice of both Alan and Mr. Scratch.  They both do an amazing job, especially with Scratch, who really pulls off the affably evil part well.\n\nWhere Alan Wake was very linear, leading you from point A to point B, American Nightmare is much more open world, which I really liked.  Though you are boxed in to a single area for each section (not by invisible walls, but by justified, actual in-game impediments), you are given complete freedom to roam through most of that area at will, picking up whatever clues or pages or other items you find along the way.  I do hope that if they ever get around to making another game, it tends more toward this setup than what was essentially a platformer in 3D.\n\nI had some control issues with the first game, but those were mostly cleared up here, leading to a much smoother gameplay experience, which enhanced my enjoyment of the overall game to a great degree.\n\nThe Bad\nWow, I kinda thought I'd have something for this section, but I guess I don't.  There was a point early in the game that I thought I was going to have a fit, when it immediately shuffled me right off to the second level without giving me a choice to continue roaming around the first and finding all the pages and whatnot, but eventually they not only let me go back to the first section to finish all that up, they did it with such a neat twist that I felt bad for having been ready to badmouth the game at all.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, by any means, I'm not going to say that.  It's really just that what problems it has are so small that they're not really worth mentioning or even remembering.\n\nOverall\nThe creators have said that they do want to make Alan Wake 2 at some point, but as far as I'm concerned they already have, and this is it.  I went into American Nightmare with the preconception that it was just going to be a rinky-dink little addendum, probably with little to no real bearing on the main game storyline at all.  Just a step above a regular bit of DLC at best.  Instead what I got was a fully realized game with a complete and awesome storyline that compliments and continues the storyline of the first game while also setting things up perfectly for the third installment.\n\nAnd I really wish Remedy would come out with a third Alan Wake already.  I would give them so much money.","September 27, 2013","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ending was anti-climatic, and I kept wishing over and over again that it would be finally finished. I had high hopes for this. Hopes that were crushed. The arcade mode is kinda fun, I guess. But definitely was not worth the price I paid for this game. I'm very disappointed. Don't buy it unless it's on sale, and even then, be careful.","March 12","false","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only reason to get this would maybe for the story. And there isn't much of story. The graphics are really bad.  You can CLEARLY see this is just a simple port from the Xbox 360 and plopped onto the pc port.  That wouldn't be so bad. The game play is ok. But this game feels like more of slap on DLC game. It feels like there was different team that worked on this. I had no issues running this on my decent gaming PC.\nAsus sabertooth z77 motherboard/ i7 3770k 3.5 GHz / 16 GB ram / 2x 240 SDD / Evga GTX 980 TI SC ACX 2.0  6 GB / WIN 7 Pro 64 bit. The game is just slap together of different parts. The quest are all fetch quest, go point a. Kill bad guys. Go point b. Kill bad guys, go to point c. Kill bad guys.  As said the game has no feeling like Alan wake had. It is kinda open world with a lot nothing to do. And the worst part is. There like 3 map you run all around and end up doing same thing for each map like 3 times.  That how dull it is. Your doing same thing over and over. Guns are bit better then Alan wake but not that much. You don't need power house to play this crappy Xbox 360 port game. But high end gpu will not make it look any better. The bushes are basically X on ground with 2 line.  How about the game play and controls?  They are meh. Playable but still feels very lifeless, and I used my PS3 DS3 (dual shock 3 controller)\nAs gamer ( love last gen consoles and this gen and my PC) I play all types of games,  This feels very unfihsed, rushed and slap on port of Xbox 360 onto the PC. As gamer and streamer from twitch. I do not recommend this a buy and give it a very low of 5 of 10. Btw they didn't even get songs/Music from Alan wake. They slap on some pretty crapy music. End turning music right off. It was that bad. And I loved music sound track from Alan wake.\nReply value is not there either. You collect scripts just like in the original Alan wake.  Do not buy this. It's worth about $5.00 if even that.\n-- quick gameplay score --\n\nGood - better guns and shooting then Alan wake, but not that much better\n\nBad - repetitive game play, 3 maps that play 3 times,  story is weak, average controls, bad graphics, it looks like a Xbox 360 game still in beta. Alan's wake look better on the 360 then this does on PC, lifeless and thrown together of left over parts that didn't use for Alan wake, feel like different team made this, no music license from original Alan wake game. It does not even feel like Alan wake game. Shame on you Remedy Entertainment, you clearly did not care about this and it shows.\n\nIs this what gaming community is coming too? All about making $$$ and giving us bad ports?\nAnd I'm gamer, I remember the Vic 20 computer and Atari 2600 console lol. Still a gamer for both consoles and PC,\n\nThis is bad port right from 360 that feels unfinished.  Do not buy this. The DLC from Alan wake were way better or go play Alan wake again on 360/PC. If not play it. Get it over this.\n\nScore - 5 of 10.\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/centaurchester","May 29","false","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The setting, the writing, the mechanics, all good.\n\nIn some ways, this game is more of the same.   Burn away darkness, blow away zom-.. sorry, "Taken".\n\nBut where Alan Wake's combat got pretty samey a few chapters in, American Nightmare's combat got samey almost immediately, and although Wake is supposed to be experienced at this sort of thing now, there was basically no tension.  There were quite a few "Oh crap" moments in the first game where the game would have a genuine surprise ready to throw at me. Not so in Nightmare.\n\nThe story (though I will not spoil) is also pretty light-weight.  The big bad shows up to taunt you, throws some mooks at you, rinse and repeat.  The nature of the Wakeverse is such that ambiguity about what's going on is entirely appropriate, but in Nightmare the writers seemed to use it as an excuse to avoid writing.\n\nBuy Alan Wake, but you can readily give this one a pass.","March 17","false","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The enemy types are similar to the last game, and although they follow the same formula of flashlight-stun-shoot they have different abilities and appearances.\n\nThis game is set in the Arizona desert as opposed to the last games lush Pacific Northwest forests. The setting makes for a nice change of pace, and the big open landscape is really beneficial to the combat and exploration in my opinion. Also, whereas the last game took a lot of cues from American horror literature... and Twin Peaks. This game takes more cues from American horror films, and television, specifically the Twilight Zone, and it's very well off for it.\n\nThe story doesn't do as much as I would like in continuing the storyline from the first game but is still fairly interesting on it's own as it gives glimpses into what's going on in "the real world."  I think the developers wanted to do more in that regard, but held back because they're still hoping to do a proper sequel at some point.\n\nFinally, I'm not sure if it's because of the restraints on the development or just a design choice but the biggest drawback of the game is the constant backtracking. You replay each area at least three times due to a weird time travel element in the storyline. Although it does get sped up each time due to you changing things in the past it's still fairly annoying, I would have preferred more areas, or just a shorter experience honestly.\n\nOverall though, the game is a good indication of the potential of the Alan Wake franchise in my opinion. I hope eventually a Publisher takes note of American Nightmare and decides to fund an actual Alan Wake 2 at some point.","August 31, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being quicker paced and more action packed with a large variety of weapons, including a nail gun and assault rifle, American Nightmare is a pulp fiction video game galore. It's pulp fiction because of how it's told, the narrative is that Alan Wake wrote himself into an episode of Night Springs just so he can slip into reality from the darkness and kill Mr. Scratch, the doppleganger that appears at the end of Alan Wake.\n\nI absolutely love the art style Remedy approached when recreating a sort of desert town in Arizona, the canyons, cacti, shrubs, and red rocks really stand out. Textures could be higher quality, but originally being an XBLA game, I'm assuming they had to consolidate the sizes. A shame they didn't go all out on the PC port though. Another thing I enjoyed was the semi-open world they layed out. The game is split into three areas, the Motel area, Observation tower area, and the drive-in theater. Each of the levels are rather small, but open enough that you can explore to find the manuscript pages and take in the details.\n\nBasically, I really liked this game. It could have been longer, and the textures could have been higher quality, but I understand that they weren't able to make American Nightmare a full game as Microsoft wanted Remedy to start working on the upcoming Quantum Break, which I hope comes to PC. The ending of Nightmare leaves me wanting more though, I need to find out what happens to Alan Wake. I just hope Remedy makes the long awaited sequel some day.\n\n9.0/10","August 12, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Therefor, the pros and cons rely a lot on comparison with Alan Wake.\n\nPros:\n+ Collecting manuscrpit pages now has a clear benefit that was absent in it's predecessor.\n+ New cool enemies.\n+ Intelligent AI, the enemies try to surround you whenever possible.\n+ Loot and pick-ups are well marked.\n+ Plenty of ammo.\n+ Open world.\n+ Battery change is quicker than in Alan Wake.\n+ Usage of real actors in cut scenes.\n\nCons:\n- From visual point of view it's a step back from Alan Wake.\n- This sequel feels more like a game. It's predecessor had such a high standard of realism that it felt more life-like.\n- The graphics are worse than in Alan Wake.\n- Bad dialogues.\n- Bad characters and voiceover.\n- Feels like it was done before the main game.\n- You couldn't choose weather you wanted to leave an area.\n- Switching weapons is hard in the middle of a battle.\n- Less atmosphere = enemies weren't that scary.\n- I thought there'd be a final battle thing, it never came.\n\nVerdict:\nAmerican Nightmare often felt raw, it's state of completion rushed. Several of the choices that the developers made leave you thinking what they had in mind. So, it's not the Alan Wake you think you'd get after what they had done previously. Nevertheless I recommend it, after all we are talking about an Alan Wake game.","February 14, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As I was playing I laughed at the map layout( Ammo and weapons being in complete random places like just thrown in the middle of the street) and some character animations are just a joke. But under all its bad features there are some good things about this game. The game has a slow motion feature which adds more action to the mix. The arcade mode is just a simple survival mode.

This is not a 50 or 60 dollar game like the first Alan Wake was,  so expecting it to live up to the first game is foolish.  You definitely get your moneys worth in this game. I personally used the -developermenu command to start my first play through on Nightmare.  Playing it on Nightmare the game still only took maybe 6 hours to complete, but it was a great 6 hours.  For the Price you can not go wrong.\n\nIn this game Alan is caught in a time loop, where you have to complete the same set of objectives in the same environments 3 different times to "get it right"  Perhaps this was one of the downsides of the game for some people,  I personally found it to be a fresh new approach , and really enjoyed it.  I give this a 9 out of 10 based on what it is,  it was never released as Alan Wake 2 and I feel like a lot of the lower reviews and scores were based on that idea, rather than this being a much more affordable addon adventure.","August 18, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They now also introduce more weaponry and enemies which makes the combat more interesting and they have also improved the graphics. It's still a very narrative game with a great Stephen King-esque feel to it. It still feels as if you are walking around in a Stephen King horror novel. The protagonist and an outside person narrate the events happening in-game and this is a very interesting design choice and it appealed very much to me as it immersed me more and made the feeling as if you were playing a character in a horror novel even more apparent. If you liked the original I'm almost certain you will like this game as well, it's a great game to enjoy for the wait for Alan Wake 2 and it didn't divert much from the original story we just see a glimpse in the life of Alan after the 2 years he spent in the dark place.\nI give this game an 8/10 just because it has a great way to tell it's story, has beautifull aestethics, great graphics and a compelling story.","February 9, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(Mainly being: High Damage Single Shot, Low Damage Machine Gun or High Damage Shotgun Shot)\nIn the first game, Flashbangs and Flare Guns used to be the ultimate weapons as they can easily clear all enemies in an area. This is not the case in the sequel. They are only able to take out some weak enemies while their main function is to disable enemies and clear off the darkness.\n\nThe story component is short, about 1/3 the length of the original Alan Wake.\nHowever, there is a Arcade mode which puts you in 5 distinct settings and challenges you to score as many points as possible through defeating enemies and maintaining your streak by avoiding damage.\n\nIf you enjoyed Alan Wake, this sequel is great fun. Just take your time to explore the areas and listen to the dialogue for a more detailed understanding of Alan Wake's world.\nIf you did not enjoy Alan Wake, this sequel will not interest you much unless you would really love to try out the improved shooting mechanics and the new enemy types.\nIf you are thinking about playing either, Alan Wake is a better introduction to the series.\n\nMy review of Alan Wake can be found here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenghuang/recommended/108710/","May 21, 2015","true","9.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You are never in any danger, as you will never run out of ammo since they have multiple infinite ammo spots on each level.  You play through 3 levels, and then you play through those same 3 levels again, and then you play through those same 3 levels again before the game finally ends.  Hope you enjoy those 3 levels, because you get to see a lot of them.

Gunplay is still fun.\n\nCons: 3 hour campaign, with low replayability. Hasn't been upgraded much since the original. Plot is pretty pointless. Not as much fun as the equally "not essential to play" 2 chapters DLC for the original. Does not introduce newcomers to the concept. Taken as enemies, using flashlight with guns and light vs. dark theme makes little sense with the otherwise different style.\n\nMy recommendation: Unless this is on sale with a lot of money to save, I'd skip it. Frankly, I'd say this should be free.","March 22, 2014","false","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The gameplay. It was fine, but got extremely boring if you have to do it for more than 10 minutes without a break (whether the break be a cutscene or whatever) because in itself it's not rewarding at all to kill these dark zombies.\nNow American Nightmare makes it so that there's much less story and more gameplay. The little story this game has is extremely boring and dull, so that got completely trashed. Remains the gameplay, which is still the same unrewarding and monotone shadow killing. You can see where this goes. American Nightmare is awful, end of story.","March 4","false","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

No, certain graphics were a little wonky and there was pretty bad product placement, but it was a game I’d suggest to friends and people who enjoyed the genre of adventure/horror. The sequel on the other hand took all that was good and sort of tosses it away. Making it more of a battle game than anything else. If you're looking for that, you'll be fine.

Alan is still trapped in limbo - in the dark place, but evidently some parts of his mind attempt to escape the hold of the darkness. When he was first touched by darkness he spawned Mr. Scratch - an evil but charismatic,enigmatic as well as a "better" version of himself as Mr. Scratch himself put it.\n\nMr. Scratch is trying to get out into the world and replace Wake who is thought dead by everyone except Barry. Wake finds himself in Arizona where weird phenomena keeps happening. He finds himself in a horror episode created by Mr. Scratch. ok, no more spoilers but there are a couple of twists in the story, and then there are more...twists..again and again....\n\nThere are only three more characters in the game so it feels pretty desolate. Pretty soon the game turns into an arcade shoot. The ammo is plentiful (there are actually ammo and supply respawns throughout the game), the open-worldliness of the first map kinda takes away the feeling of accomplishment. You keep looking for the pages of the manuscript that Wake keeps writing in the dark place and use it to unlock better weapons as well as knowledge about what to do next.\n\nThere are about 5 new enemies. There are spiders, there are those who can split into multiple versions of themselves, those who can stand 9 feet tall and wild large chain saws, those who turn into birds and those who can throw stink bombs, I guess.\n\nWhat's interesting is how you are able to pick up on the events of the world through radio shows and disturbing camcorder videos done by Mr. Scratch which were an absolute blast to watch and there are plenty of them. They used plenty of live video here which is unheard of in 99% of games. I also particularly enjoyed the determinism vs. free will arguments between Wake and the astronomer as well as on the radio. Wake basically argued that the absence of free will is irrelevant given the fact that the character knows nothing about the next set of set deterministic events.\n\nIn any case the atmosphere is there, but it also feels kind of cheap, the desert is just too boring. I also found myself disinterested for the first couple of hours but then I kept playing and kept getting sucked in. It took me about 5.5 hours to finish the game. The game also does a pretty good job of explaining why the first game looked [played] like a TV show or a drama/thriller movie. Wake explains that he is able to fight the Taken effectively (and dodge attacks) because that was a small semi-realistic kernel of the main protagonist that helps propel the story forward. So many more things can make sense now for those who didn't really get the original game.\n\nThere is also a survival mode. You are given 10 minutes to fight off the taken at various locations until the sunrise. It can be fun but I doubt you will be playing it more than a few times. I put the game into the hard category because there are a few frustrating spots in the game (especially the last 20 minutes) but you do feel pretty good when you survive multiple attacks with the last few bullets.\n\nAll in all. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first game.","November 27, 2013","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VikingZX/recommended/202750/","VikingZX","Viking ZX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VikingZX/","164 products in account","Alan Wake's American Nightmare is an interesting title. A psuedo-sequel/spin-off/expansion to the psychological thriller "Alan Wake," American Nightmare is both familiar and different from it's parent. It's familiar in the sense that the core of the gameplay remains the same: you still use light to burn away protective darkness to make enemies vulnerable. Light is your ally, your friend. What's changed however, is the setting, your abilities, and the nature of the areas you'll traverse.\n\nAmerican Nightmare is set in the American Southwest—Arizona, to be exact—outside a fictional city known as Night Springs. Unlike Alan Wake, which presented the player with mostly clear point A-to-B setpieces, American Nightmare follows a more open route. Although each of the areas you'll explore isn't exactly large (the developers are clearly feeling the crunch of being restricted by XBA's size limit), you're free to roam them as you please while you accomplish your objectives, and it's usually in your best interest to do so—provided occasional darkness attacks don't prove to muc for you.\n\nFortuitously, however, Alan Wake is no longer the out-of-shape writer with a limited weapon selection he was before. In American Nightmare, he's changed himself to a more contemporary action-hero, with far more agility and skill than last we saw him. You'll find your arsenal expanded as well: sawn-off shotguns, Uzi's, Magnums, crossbows, even nail guns ... All will be needed. It's not an awe-inspiring set, but as you make your way through the game unlocking new weapons on the way to the final showdown, you'll definitely find some favorites.\n\nThe story is short (and involves a time loop, to save space once again) so you'll get used to seeing the same scenes in the basic game. Fortunately, there's more to American Nightmare.\n\nThose weapons you unlock in the main game (via finding manuscript pages)? Once you've unlocked them, you can find them in Alan Wake's other mode: Arcade. Here you're tasked with lasting ten minutes on one of several maps, using whatever you can scrounge from nearby. The generic maps aren't too challenging, but once you've beaten a few, you'll unlock a new mode that ramps the difficulty up to eleven and probably past that becomes quite intense. Trying to use your flares and flashlight to hold the horde of enemies back while frantically reloading is a blast.\n\nFrom the standpoint of a newcomer, this title could be hit or miss. I recommend it, but Alan Wake seems to be a polarizing cup of tea for many. If you're a fan of action-survival modes (CoD Zombies, Gears Horde, Resident Evil Mercenaries) than American Nightmare is worth grabbing for the Arcade alone. Otherwise, I'd recommend watching a few videos first and seeing if the gameplay style appeals to you. For me, it does.\n\nPros:\n—Clever enemy design\n—Unique Light-based combat\n—Exhilrating Arcade mode\n—Excellent soundtrack courtest of "Old Gods of Asgard" (AKA Poets of the Fall)\n—Genuine psychotically eerie villain, even if he is a ham\n\nCons:\n—Repetitive Environments\n—Limited types of enemies, even if they are clever\n—A little too much focus on conventional weapons over the light based ones\n—I did miss the more powerful flashlights from the original title.\n\nRecommendation: Buy it if you're a fan of the genre or a fan of Alan Wake, watch first otherwise. Definitely fun though.","January 12, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I finished it with all the collectables within 6 hours, but enjoyed all of it. The game retains the same combat mechanics as the first title, and throws in a few new refreshing additions, such as new weapons, new enemies, and a different style of boss fights.\n\nJust like the first game, the storytelling is strong. This time, live action is used more heavily. All the cutscenes are done surprisingly well in live action, and there are a lot more ingame tv bits of Alan talking crazy. The cutscenes and Alan's dialogue/manuscript readings are great to listen to. The game is much shorter this time around with only three levels, which cleverly repeat themselves over the course of 3 Acts. There is also an Arcade mode apart form the main Story mode. It resembles a typical survival mode of some zombie killing game. You can avoid it.\n\nOverall, another good game by Remedy. It's a nice short extension to the Alan Wake storyline if you feel you need more of it after beating the first.","August 4, 2013","true","6.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VikingZX/recommended/202750/","VikingZX","Viking ZX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VikingZX/","164 products in account","Alan Wake's American Nightmare is an interesting title. A psuedo-sequel/spin-off/expansion to the psychological thriller "Alan Wake," American Nightmare is both familiar and different from it's parent. It's familiar in the sense that the core of the gameplay remains the same: you still use light to burn away protective darkness to make enemies vulnerable. Light is your ally, your friend. What's changed however, is the setting, your abilities, and the nature of the areas you'll traverse.\n\nAmerican Nightmare is set in the American Southwest—Arizona, to be exact—outside a fictional city known as Night Springs. Unlike Alan Wake, which presented the player with mostly clear point A-to-B setpieces, American Nightmare follows a more open route. Although each of the areas you'll explore isn't exactly large (the developers are clearly feeling the crunch of being restricted by XBA's size limit), you're free to roam them as you please while you accomplish your objectives, and it's usually in your best interest to do so—provided occasional darkness attacks don't prove to muc for you.\n\nFortuitously, however, Alan Wake is no longer the out-of-shape writer with a limited weapon selection he was before. In American Nightmare, he's changed himself to a more contemporary action-hero, with far more agility and skill than last we saw him. You'll find your arsenal expanded as well: sawn-off shotguns, Uzi's, Magnums, crossbows, even nail guns ... All will be needed. It's not an awe-inspiring set, but as you make your way through the game unlocking new weapons on the way to the final showdown, you'll definitely find some favorites.\n\nThe story is short (and involves a time loop, to save space once again) so you'll get used to seeing the same scenes in the basic game. Fortunately, there's more to American Nightmare.\n\nThose weapons you unlock in the main game (via finding manuscript pages)? Once you've unlocked them, you can find them in Alan Wake's other mode: Arcade. Here you're tasked with lasting ten minutes on one of several maps, using whatever you can scrounge from nearby. The generic maps aren't too challenging, but once you've beaten a few, you'll unlock a new mode that ramps the difficulty up to eleven and probably past that becomes quite intense. Trying to use your flares and flashlight to hold the horde of enemies back while frantically reloading is a blast.\n\nFrom the standpoint of a newcomer, this title could be hit or miss. I recommend it, but Alan Wake seems to be a polarizing cup of tea for many. If you're a fan of action-survival modes (CoD Zombies, Gears Horde, Resident Evil Mercenaries) than American Nightmare is worth grabbing for the Arcade alone. Otherwise, I'd recommend watching a few videos first and seeing if the gameplay style appeals to you. For me, it does.\n\nPros:\n—Clever enemy design\n—Unique Light-based combat\n—Exhilrating Arcade mode\n—Excellent soundtrack courtest of "Old Gods of Asgard" (AKA Poets of the Fall)\n—Genuine psychotically eerie villain, even if he is a ham\n\nCons:\n—Repetitive Environments\n—Limited types of enemies, even if they are clever\n—A little too much focus on conventional weapons over the light based ones\n—I did miss the more powerful flashlights from the original title.\n\nRecommendation: Buy it if you're a fan of the genre or a fan of Alan Wake, watch first otherwise. Definitely fun though.","January 12, 2014","true","6.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

While it's not a direct continuation of the original's story, fans of the first game may find some value in reading through as many manuscript pages as possible, though the lack of any real answers may also be frustrating. On the flip side, those new to the franchise might feel lost, thanks to the surprising absence of any backstory or exposition. Still, as was the case with the first game, Alan Wake's American Nightmare manages to overcome some glaring issues, thanks to its strong writing.","September 1, 2012","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So I knew going into this that it was going to be a short experience since it is not a sequel but instead a little side story. Knowing this still didn't prepare me for this watered down version of the original game, the story is pretty straight forward with very little room for exploration, characters are for the most part uninteresting with nothing really important to contribute to the story or experience (almost robotic at times), and the repeating of the same 3 levels 3 times was getting me to the point of not wanting to finish the game.\n\nOk so it may seem that I am coming right out the gate with all the negatives but I did enoy this game and I'm going to justify it. Even though you repeat the same 3 levels 3 times over, which at first disappointed me, but near the end I felt they handled it the best they could, with each time you play that level it was a different experience because the characters sort of knew what was going on and helped speed the process of completing the level. Everytime you went back they completed some of the tasks that you had to complete yourself the time before. The graphics are beautiful just like in the original but this time it didn't have as many post card type scenes to look at. Gameplay and combat are the same from the original with Alan Wake not being the most agile guy in video games but it felt right for the context of the Alan Wake universe. Manuscripts this time around serve more of a unlock system rather than just a piece of additional pieces of information about the story, if you collect enough manuscripts you can open weapon boxes that are laid out around the environment which give you more powerful guns to help you proceed a little faster through that game (ex. SMG's, Assualt Rifles, and Hunting Rifles). They also added a few more enemy types that are very welcomed, nothing worse than fighting the same enemies over and over again.\n\nAside from the story mode, they have Arcade Mode, this is like a horde mode that you defeat the Taken until the sun comes up (10 minutes), it was fun but I do feel like it was a missed opportunity for co-op or multiplayer, which it weird because usually I'm the one that doesn't want multiplayer in story driven games like Assassin's Creed and Mass Effect. But in this case it would've been nice, especially since you only play it to get the highest score on the leaderboards.\n\nThat's pretty much it without spoiling the game, I do recommend it for people who like Alan Wake or for people who never played it before, it is a good game with a couple disappointments here and there but nonetheless a great game to play for a few hours.","February 10, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the original game was strong in it's story and atmosphere, this one is more cozy and laid back with a bit of a confusing story. Also with an introduction of new enemies and weapons was a bit interesting.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nHere is what i liked about the game:- Manuscripts you can pickup in the game\n- Controls are the same as in the first game\n- Can sprint much longer\n- New Arcade mode (Boring because there is no coop)\n\nAs in the first game, there is manuscripts you can pick up. I think it adds some insight to what is actually happening here. Controls are exactly the same besides the fact that you can run for much longer in this game, in the original you barely started running before you ran out of energy.. I like that they tried to add a new game mode, but it falls short because it's not really fun.. You just have to survive for 10 minutes in some random location while dealing with ghostmen.. it's hard, but it's boring. I wish they would have implemented multiplayer on that part.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNow here is what i didn't like about the game:- Confusing story?\n- Automatic weapons\n- Different ghostmen, but you ahve to deal with them the same way\n- A little too cozy/They removed the atmosphere effects\n\nI don't really know how to feel about the story, it's confusing and  you have to run through the same areas 3 times.. that's right.. 3 times. I kind of got the story once i was done with story mode. And seriously, i think the automatic weapons made the game way too easy. They kind of removed the charm of the game itself. Also, if you played the original.. you know how to deal with these guys. There is one exception.. there is the splitter who splits into 2 if you point your flashlight at him, but the fun in that weared out in 10 minutes. Also, the game really feels cozy since they decided to remove the creepy effect you experienced in the first game. Especially in the woods.. ugh.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe Verdict:A little too cozy, a little too easy, kind of confusing story and the same gameplay as in the original game. It falls short compared the the original game and quickly becomes boring and linear. Arcade mode is boring. Ending was kind of expected. It had a few moments, but that's it. If you must get it, i would recommend getting it on sale since the 4 hours of gameplay is linear and repetitive as ****.\n\nNot recommended.","June 19, 2015","false","4.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Alan is still trapped in limbo - in the dark place, but evidently some parts of his mind attempt to escape the hold of the darkness. When he was first touched by darkness he spawned Mr. Scratch - an evil but charismatic,enigmatic as well as a "better" version of himself as Mr. Scratch himself put it.\n\nMr. Scratch is trying to get out into the world and replace Wake who is thought dead by everyone except Barry. Wake finds himself in Arizona where weird phenomena keeps happening. He finds himself in a horror episode created by Mr. Scratch. ok, no more spoilers but there are a couple of twists in the story, and then there are more...twists..again and again....\n\nThere are only three more characters in the game so it feels pretty desolate. Pretty soon the game turns into an arcade shoot. The ammo is plentiful (there are actually ammo and supply respawns throughout the game), the open-worldliness of the first map kinda takes away the feeling of accomplishment. You keep looking for the pages of the manuscript that Wake keeps writing in the dark place and use it to unlock better weapons as well as knowledge about what to do next.\n\nThere are about 5 new enemies. There are spiders, there are those who can split into multiple versions of themselves, those who can stand 9 feet tall and wild large chain saws, those who turn into birds and those who can throw stink bombs, I guess.\n\nWhat's interesting is how you are able to pick up on the events of the world through radio shows and disturbing camcorder videos done by Mr. Scratch which were an absolute blast to watch and there are plenty of them. They used plenty of live video here which is unheard of in 99% of games. I also particularly enjoyed the determinism vs. free will arguments between Wake and the astronomer as well as on the radio. Wake basically argued that the absence of free will is irrelevant given the fact that the character knows nothing about the next set of set deterministic events.\n\nIn any case the atmosphere is there, but it also feels kind of cheap, the desert is just too boring. I also found myself disinterested for the first couple of hours but then I kept playing and kept getting sucked in. It took me about 5.5 hours to finish the game. The game also does a pretty good job of explaining why the first game looked [played] like a TV show or a drama/thriller movie. Wake explains that he is able to fight the Taken effectively (and dodge attacks) because that was a small semi-realistic kernel of the main protagonist that helps propel the story forward. So many more things can make sense now for those who didn't really get the original game.\n\nThere is also a survival mode. You are given 10 minutes to fight off the taken at various locations until the sunrise. It can be fun but I doubt you will be playing it more than a few times. I put the game into the hard category because there are a few frustrating spots in the game (especially the last 20 minutes) but you do feel pretty good when you survive multiple attacks with the last few bullets.\n\nAll in all. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first game.","November 27, 2013","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Gotta admit, I found the first Alan wake too hard for me. But I got a Steam Controller for Christmas and it works so great with American Nightmare!\n\nAs a casual gamer I just played story mode on normal level. but this game has a lot of variation for people who wanna kick it up a notch with nightmare mode and arcade mode.\n\nThe graphics and voice acting were awesome. I found the actual gameplay much easier than the first one in terms of port. Movements were better, shooting was better, and just the overall controls were much better. I really can't say enough about how well it worked with the steam controller.\n\nThe cut scenes weren't too long, and the story was interesting... picking right up where Alan Wake left off.

I was hoping for a longer scene after the end credits. The final boss battle was actually one of the easier battles of the game.\n\nAs opposed to the first one where you could get stuck in a loop where you restart a checkpoint but have no ammo or batteries, this game made sure there were plenty of opprotunities to get what you needed.\n\nI found it interesting that most of the supporting characters were women, was kinda hoping to see some of the characters from the first Alan Wake.\n\nI took me a while to beat, I'm sure more competant gamers could beat it faster and enjoy unlocking all the achievments.

Whether or not this constitutes an improvement is up to individual taste, of course...\n\nThere seems to come a time in every "survival horror" franchise's lifespan when it's time to dumb things down a little...to sacrifice some of that oh-so-sacred atmosphere in favour of MORE ACTION.  'Cause after all, we video game addicts are basically just a bunch of infantile, monosyllabic EEJITS, right?  We just like to kill things, essentially; and the more things, the better.  The Resident Evil series cottoned onto this, slowly, gradually, and by RE5 we'd well and truly decided to favour firepower over anything more nuanced, such as making the audience ♥♥♥♥ in their proverbial pants and re-check their ammo supplies every time so much as a single zombie started lumbering towards them.  Silent Hill: Downpour introduced boxing-style "dodge" mechanics to a series once about blundgeoning things slowly to death with a crude "found" weapon like a piece of pipe; and perhaps appropriately so, considering we now had enemies which danced about like Cassius Clay whilst jabbing punches in our general direction.  Nothing says "scary" like a bout of gentlemanly fisticuffs, I'm sure you'll agree.\n\nThe Alan Wake series has seen fit, for whatever reason, to escalate things to the "♥♥♥♥ art, let's kill" aesthetic by the mere SECOND game in the series, but the news isn't all bad...'cause as these sorts of games go, this is actually a good'un.  But first, let's get the more negative observations out of the way, with the aforementioned Borderlands reference being a good place to start.  The graphics, while frankly gorgeous, are decidedly more "comic book"-ish a la the Gearbox game, but this is all keeping with the tone of the piece (i.e. less moody, more cartoon-y), so let's call that a "draw" rather than a negative.  Compared to the original, this game also has a much greater variety of guns and enemy types - again, some of you are probably saying "Oh, sweet" at this point - but it also has ammo in such bountiful supply that you barely ever raise a sweat over running out of said goodies, a sure-fire way to reduce the tension and thereby "scariness" of any remotely serious "horror" game to almost nada.  And finally, while the original was a TINY bit guilty of such modern-isms, this entry is SO overgenerous in pointing out where you're supposed to go next that you could easily halve the game-time by just ignoring all the little extras hanging 'round the periphery in favour of making a beeline to every objective.  In short, you don't "need" to explore all around, and doing so will pretty much just give you a couple of extra weapons (which aren't necessarily any "better", and which you have to throw away existing ones to weild anyway), as well as a handful of oh-so-integral "Achievements"...as opposed to the earlier game, in which failure to search around could very well mean the difference between having enough supplies or not to combat and/or sprint your way through to the next section.\n\nOne of the few Silent Hill-esque almost-clichés which the first game (mostly) overlooked was that of deja-vu.  Now, I know a lot of you whiny ♥♥♥♥ers who complain about not getting enough monetary "value" out of your games often see this as a cheap-'n'-nasty way for game designers to skimp on programming fresh new locations, but I actually really dug the way that what you essentially do in this game - SPOILER ALERT - is play a mere three locations/"maps" THREE TIMES EACH, with relatively slight variations each time.  I noticed a few reviews where people complained about this, but the truth is, not only are things somewhat "different" every time you revisit a location (it's a "time loop" thing), but the chapters also get shorter and pacier as NPCs you've met before retain enough awareness of previous encounters with you that they start helping out in ways which save both time and effort, creating a genuine sense of increasing momentum which gave yours truly, at least, sufficient motivation to finish the game in a mere three sittings (which, believe me, is much quicker than I tend to finish MOST games, hahaha).\n\nI actually found the way the whole thing unravels to be quite interesting...I won't go as far as "fascinating", but definitely interesting.  Story-wise, this game is actually quite comparable in quality to the original, it's just the STYLE of presentation which I found less to my liking.  This is basically a "third-person shooter", when all is said and done, while Alan Wake the first had quite a bit more to it - including tactical decisions such as when to just RUN for one's dear life rather than stand and fight - whereas in this one you really may as well just stick around and take 'em all down, 'cause chances are there's plenty more bullets and batteries just five metres away from where you're standing.  Nifty story-telling, charming graphics, great voice (and some visual!) acting and whatever else aside, this is basically just a "run here, kill some things, pick up something or switch something on, then run back to here" kind of game...though one which fortunately doesn't overstay its welcome (yes, sure enough, the "this game isn't long enough" brigade are sure to complain, even at ten lousy dollars).  One unusual criticism coming from the likes of me, though, is that it's a surprisingly EASY game, at least on Normal mode - maybe this was partly because I'd just come straight off the more challenging main game and its two hard-as-a-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLCs - but there is at least a Nightmare mode for me to look forward to (though I suspect that one's not going to be TOO much of a strain either, considering I only died in this one about four or five times at most...we shall see).\n\nOn the whole, though, this is a really, really good game...one which I would probably think more highly of if my expectations hadn't been unrealistically heightened by the sheer "old-school survival horror" excellence of its predecessor.  Oddly enough, it almost seems to be a game targeted more at the people who DIDN'T like the first Alan Wake, as opposed to those who DID!  Or perhaps this was just meant to be a short, fun, trashy fill-in adventure between Alan Wake and a "proper" sequel, which one can only hope is still to grace this world with its glorious presence.  But enjoy this one for what it is, for what it's clearly INTENDED to be, and Bob just might be your mother's brother.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","August 14, 2014","true","6.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The end product is a shallow, outrageous mockery of the original game, which may only be enjoyable for those who like the simplest B-grade shooter titles, or just thought that Alan Wake wasn’t like Max Payne enough.\n\nLong version:If Alan Wake was the video game equivalent of a large-budget mystery thriller miniseries that aired on prime time, then Alan Wake’s American Nightmare is like as if Syfy made the second season.\nThe original game featured a highly detailed and lush environments and led you through several unique and enjoyable levels. This one has three painfully empty maps with a few objects scattered here and there and buildings crammed together with little coherence. And the maps are recycled three times in the so-called “story” with the exact same objectives, but with some new type of enemies.\nYou can also forget the memorable supporting cast, here you have the most clichéd evil twin of the protagonist and three female supports, who are so bland and void of all character traits that you will most likely forget their names by the time you see the level end screen.\nIn some manner this is all explained in the intro and in the (horribly banal) narrative: the whole story is supposed to be taken as some low-budget late-night horror show with all the bad things it comes with. But the problem is: they nailed it too perfectly. It is boring and uninteresting, and in all the wrong ways.\n\nAnd this leads us to the worst part of the game: it’s nothing, but a huge shooter. The weak story and the non-existent characters are only cardboard decoration to the never-ending shooting. The combat focus becomes even more painfully obvious when you see the Arcade mode in the main menu, which is exactly what it sounds like: you get dropped in an arena and must kill the never-ending wave of enemies.\nThe only problem is: the mechanic is the same. You still have to shine light on them for several seconds to make them vulnerable, and you still can’t shoot while doing it. So each fight is nothing but a big chase around the empty maps: you try to dissolve shields while dozens of baddies are trying to get you. Sounds fun? Probably not, because it isn’t.\nJust avoid it and act like Alan Wake’s story ended with the last chapter of the original game.","August 20, 2014","false","19.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

Alan Wake's strengths were its story, pacing, and graphics. The combat was a bit of a toss-up between decent and monotonous, depending on who you asked. American Nightmare is a shorter, weirder story told across three mostly open areas that you visit multiple times. The visuals are still sharp, but lose a lot of the atmosphere that Alan Wake had... the open desert just doesn't have the same creep factor as the dark woods, at least not as it's shown here. Dialogue is pretty snappy and clever, but it's propping up a story that really adds nothing to the themes introduced in Alan Wake.\n\nSo the main draw is the combat, and to its credit, it's a little more interesting than in Alan Wake. Enemy encounters are varied in makeup, and there are some new foes like ones that split if you shine light on them and creepy jumping spider things. All the original weapons are here, along with new additions like a nailgun, uzi, and carbine. You can unlock weapon cases with additional weapons by finding manuscript pages scattered around which encourages exploration, but honestly as large as the areas are, there's not much to find. Enemies only appear as you follow the main plot, and the game showers you with ammo and flare, more than enough to handle any situation. I tried playing on the harder of the two difficulties and the battles were still a breeze with all the resources I had, but I could be killed in just two hits which led to some frustration with unlucky hits at the ends of long fights.\n\nThere's an arcade mode similar to the mercenaries modes in Resident Evil that's pretty fun, assuming you like the combat. And that's really what American Nightmare boils down to, did you like the combat in Alan Wake? If so, this is for you, but don't come looking for the atmosphere or story of the original.","September 11, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not a fear-filled game and certainly doesn't build up atmostphere like the last one as you are thrust into the action, however that doesn't mean it's bad. The story is very good and it gives a happy ending to it too.\n\nThe improvements I like is that you have a mini map to tell you where the manuscripts are, making the achievement to get them all insultingly easy, which is a good thing in my opinion.\n\nAlso, collecting the manuscripts gives you an advantage. The more you collect the more weapons you can unlock which can help cut the enemies down. Free tip, Crossbow is the best damn weapon. It destroys the darkness surrounding the Taken and for most Taken it's a one-hit kill.\n\nThe creatures in this are a lot more creative. You have some that don't have protection, but instead split and these creepy spider-like creatures. Clearly here the people were being more creative with the monsters and it's very well recieved and Mr. Scratch makes a very good villain. If you liked the first game, you'll love this one too, but it is more action based than storline I'm afraid, as you can tell from the many achievements revolving around the arcade mode.","November 12, 2013","true","7.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I played the first Alan Wake and remember they combat and weapons and story. This game is good with graphics and is a solid familiar feel to the old version but certainly isn't as pleasing. This game features more weapons which i believe is one of the greatest downfalls of the game. I mean the reward of collecting pages for a better weapon is okay but i believe could of been integrated in a different way.  This game was way to easy to complete and the mechanics babied you too much the entire time. On my first playthrough i beat the game in 3.5 hours and collected 40 out of the 53 pages. The mini map even had minor indicators for the pages you search for; which tells me that the pages truely aren't hidden. Your suppose to work for the pages not be lead to them. With this said the unlockable weapons will range from a scale of VERY underpowered or SUPER overpowered. To me the characters are crap for realism. Alan wake is a Writer not a soldier and somehow he knows how to perfectly use an assault rifle? The character even admits it himself in the first game he never used a gun for a long period of time if at all. The mechanics of the revolvers, shotguns and a bolt action rifle are easy to learn by looking at them. But military grade weapons are much to complex to use like a pro the first shot. With this said your magical ability to use each weapon like a master and reload them withen seconds is what makes the game far too easy. The story was meh but good if you get it on sale for a time killer. i paid 99cents .  I say content was extremely lacking and this game feels more like a special dlc for the game.  I say this game is worth one playthrough if your a fan of Alan wake but other then that this game is definitely not worth full price. wait for a holiday sale . With all this said i must add that the first game had a stronger feel of lonely helplessness while here you feel like your able to fully help yourself with no big issue. but would i reccomend this that would be a no.","December 8, 2015","false","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinglm/recommended/202750/","Kinglm","Ravelord Nito","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinglm/","262 products in account","I only suggest that you buy this game if you get it 80% off in a bundle with the first one. Or if you already have beaten the first one and want more story explained (but even then, its not worth 10 bucks!!) And btw i didnt even bother playing the Arcade part of the game, this is just a review of the capaign portion.\n\nHere are the problems that i have with this game:\n- The suspence/horror aspect that we all loved from Alan Wake is completely gone. Think of the progression from Dead Space 1 to Dead Space 3, except Dead Space 3 made up for it cuz it was far more epic. This game is more tailored to an action adventure, and it hardly feels like Alan Wake anymore\n- This game supplies you with the closest thing to unlimited ammo i have ever seen. Its absolutely ridiculous. Dont even bother conserving ammo and batteries because you will NEVER run out. The result of this ammo surplus makes the game completely unintimidating.\n- The man who played Alan Wakes Doppelganger persona was a TERRIBLE ACTOR. It might not bother you, but i wanted to gouge my eyes out when you tune into his monologues on the TVs because of how god awful his attempt to be insane and evil was.\n- THE REPETITION. Its so incredibly repetative that i have no desire to focus 70% of the time playing.\n- Throughout the game there are a total of 3 moments when there would be "battle music" of some kind to add to the "epicness" of the situation and 2 out of 3 of the songs were terrible. One was some extremely cheesy 1980's heavy metal track with bad vocals and terribly guitar solos and the other was just stupid ("IM A PSYCHO BABY, I TOLD YOU IM A PSYCHOOO"). Again, it may not bother you too much, but i couldnt stand it.\n\nHOWEVER! Here are some reasons you SHOULD play this game:\n\n- The story holds some unanswered questions about what happens after Alan Wake at the end of the first one, and about his wife and whatnot\n- The combat was smoother, and the addition of new types of enemies was very refreshing\n\nOVERALL, if you loved the first one, and this one is cheap, just get it, beat it and uninstall. Its worth the experience and storyline explaination but other than that it doesnt even compare to the original.","April 1, 2014","false","3.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story is a dark, twisted, sinister-like fantasy all wrapped up in a strong narrative by yours truly, The Champion of Light, Alan Wake.\n\nTo tell you a little bit about the developer, Remedy, they brought us the classic video games like Max Payne 1 and 2. Inventive storytelling, with a dark tonality. Alan Wake's American Nightmare might not pose any scares like the original Alan Wake, but it's such a well-polished PC port that I can't help but acknowledge Remedy for doing such a wonderful job.\n\nThe graphics feature high-resolution, and high-res textures, making the Xbox 360 version pale in comparison. I remember vividly playing the original Alan Wake on the Xbox 360 and the difference is like night and day. Although, I have no regrets about buying the original Alan Wake on the Xbox 360 because it went towards supporting such a great developer, and now we have American Nightmare. The visuals are clean and crisp. I think I took over 100 screenshots in my first 2-3 hours of gameplay. I couldn't help but stop to look at the surroundings and environments. The lighting and shadows are incredible. It's a beautiful game.\n\nExcellent story, narrative, atmosphere, immersion, and being one of the top 10 best PC-ported video games on the planet, American Nightmare stretches to a 6-7 hour standalone game for a mere price of $5-10 on a good sale. It's totally worth that much and more.\n\nDespite these bright features, American Nightmare is flawed by being too easy on the difficulty side. The game loses all tension on Normal mode, and it is best played on Nightmare mode instead. On Normal mode, there are ample ammo and weapons throughout the environments and fighting enemies is way too simplified and easy. Enemies do not even get close to you with the high amount of arsenal and flares at your disposal. But if you're just looking for an atmospheric experience without the challenge, then Normal mode is perfectly suitable for a playthrough.\n\nIf you thoroughly enjoyed the original Alan Wake, and you want more of pursue more of the atmospheric-story-driven game, look no further. Turn the lights off, put on your headphones, and drift away into the darkness.\n\nRating: 8 out of 10","July 31, 2013","true","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/c_skull/recommended/202750/","c_skull","Cyberskull","http://steamcommunity.com/id/c_skull/","196 products in account","As a writer, I consider the first Alan Wake a great game for its metalinguistic. The story within the story, the topic of what makes a writer a writer, the symbolism of the dark force as the market and the stupid corporate suits who twist and turn the will of an artist to make raw money... The fact that the story unfolded in two fronts (the game and the pages you collected) was specially fascinating.\n\nAs a gamer, the first Alan wake was interesting, nothing special beyond the light mechanic but fun on its own way, I ended up annoyed because even in the nightmare, the enemies were merely annoying and there was too much ammo (and with my hoarder mentality from games like Resident Evil and Dead Space, I ended having lots of moments where I left crates of ammo behind because I was full).\n\nBut this... unfortunately... feels like a shoddy and lazy filler. There is no story, it's just Alan hunting his doppleganger that it's in his place because story reasons that aren't really explained, the same places are used over and over and over. The city that the developers made with care to look alive and real is replaced by three patches of boring desert with three female characters that are awfully and lazily voiced. The combat has been dumbed down (amazingly), even if there are more guns for you to use, you can only carry two: A main arm, and a sidearm.\n\n"But sir! Alan Wake was supposed to be realistic! The devs said so! You don't see a guy carrying fifteen weapons on his pockets!" Yeah, the devs also said that this game is more action-packed and inspired in americana action series. It's specially grieving since now ammo is universal. Black and red boxes will fill ammo for your side arm, and orange boxes will give ammo for your main weapon. Regardless if you're using an uzi, a nail gun, a rifle or a shotgun. It mostly boils to the fact that they wanted to port it from the consoles to the computers as fast as they could and couldn't be bothered with changing.\n\nAnd to make things 'worse', the 'realistic' excuse can't be used anymore, since Alan now fights weird enemies that turn into birds or that split in half when shown bright light. While in the first game the dark presence merely took possession of people and objects, now it... mutates them? It gives an excuse that since the antagonist is different, it does different stuff but... again, within the own meta-linguistic, the story gives no reason WHY the antagonist could do it.\n\nSpeaking of meta-linguistic, all the pages that explained what happened to npcs and about the story that is unfolding were, again, severely dumbed down. With only three girls to talk to and three scenarios, and with most of the surprises being gone, most pages are just filler, annoying filler, needless filler.\n\nWhile I didn't had high expectations about this game (with the company acknowledging that they wanted their time to make Alan Wake 2 and didn't wanted to rush things) I at least expected that they would do an enjoyable work, like the DLCs from the first game.\n\nThe only way I could reccomend this game is if you liked the combat mechanics from the first Alan Wake and wanted to play a dumbed down, arcade version of it.","May 13","false","7.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While American Nightmare takes aim at correcting many shortcomings from the original game, such as the horrid combat system, it felt as if it was missing much more.\n\nAs stated, American Nightmare supplies Alan with a greater arsenal and enhanced combat system much lacking in the first game. Unfortunately, American Nightmare steers away from the captivating storyline and supplies the gamer with a plot that is more reminiscent of an afterthought or pages of the original script that arguably, should have been left in the waste bin.\n\nFeaturing unusual level lay-out I can't explicitly describe without a spoiler, I can say it seems very much a cop out. At times I felt frustrated enough to mutter to myself, “If this keeps going on like this… I’m going to stop playing.” American Nightmare comes across less as an excellent addition to a thought provoking game, and more of an over-hyped, contractually obligated DLC. I would only recommend if you can find on sale, and were a huge fan of the original game and really feel the need to lick Remedy Game’s plate clean.","July 26, 2014","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The reason I do not recommend this is because, well, it's almost nothing like the first game. A huge dissapointment to me. So, if you like the way they made the first game, DO NOT buy this. If you didn't care for the first one. This is a completely different kind of game, so you could try it. It's a decent game. If it didn't have "Alan Wake" in the title, I could have probably tollerated it because, like I said before, It's practically nothing like the original. More weapons, more enemies and the campaign is the same thing 3 times over. Not too apealing to me. If you love monotony, I highly recommend this game to you.\n\nP.S.

It follows the "stuck in nightmare world" idea, and most of your time is spent blasting away enemies in (the same) three stages. Repeat that three times and that's all there is to American Nightmare. Not much.\n\nAmerican Nightmare completely lacks the psychological aspect of 'psychological thriller,' that the original Alan Wake was barely able to pull off (similar to Silent Hill). Besides sharing the same name, the two titles have little in common. American Nightmare is simply Alan Wake, reduced to a basic shoot-em-up arcade style games with little-to-no story set in three repeated stages.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that if you're looking for some resolution to the ending of the original Alan Wake, you won't find it here.","January 10, 2014","false","7.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

With that said, I found this standalone sequel to be rather disappointing in comparison to the brilliant first game; bear in mind that I do not think this is a bad game, it just falls rather falt and disappoints after the first game.\nAlan Wake's American Nightmare is intended to play out as an episode of the fictional TV show called Night Springs, and is narrated by Lloyd Floyd, who provides an interesting narration to the story.The game has Alan Wake trapped in a sparse desert area, and who must find a way to escape the recurring nightmare he is stuck in.\nAnd that leads to my first problem with the game; because Alan is stuck in a nightmare which repeats itself, you are forced to endure the same hour of gameplay THREE TIMES in a row until you finish this game. The exact same missions and locations, repeated three times. The first time is fun, the second time is kinda uninteresting, and the third time is downright boring and repetitive. This is a lazy way to repeat locations in a game, and it also reflects the poor writing skill of the writers.\nThe story is rather weird and disjointed. Throughout the entire game, you do a lot of things for unexplained reasons which aren't apparrently clear when you do them or even at the end of the game. The whole story is weird and quirky, but not in a good way, as it barely makes sense. The characters, apart from Alan and the absolutely BRILLIANT Mr Scratch, are boring and are just as quirky as the story itself. However, I found the live action cut scenes rather good, which was a surprise for me.\nThe gameplay is exactly the same as the first game, except that you can use new weapons like sub machine guns and nail guns. That's it. Zero changes made to the gameplay.\nThere's also a survival mode, which is actually quite fun. It's intense, challenging, and a fun way to compete on the leaderboards with your friends. I found this mode better than the campaign to be honest.\nOverall, this is certainly not a bad game; it merely fails to innovate, and doesn't capture me the way the first game did. I still love Alan Wake, but this game disappointed me quite a bit. If you don't mind an extremely repetitive story, even with the game's shining parts, then pick t up for $3 on sale. 6 / 10.","January 26, 2014","false","5.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Also, it's a little short.  Arcade mode can add a lot of replayability.  If you're not sure, just pick it up on sale, preferrably as the Alan Wake Franchise so you can get the amazing first title.\n--\nDo I recommend it?  Only if you liked the first, or want the arcade mode.  Still rocking those fight-with-light mechanics, still fighting them darkness zambies, just more of the same-- which, trust me, isn't a bad thing!  It's a four to six hour standalone DLC campaign taking place after the events of the first game, and possibly the closest we'll ever get to a sequel (since Remedy's in deep ♥♥♥♥ and leaning on the success of Quantum Break).\n\nI went ahead and took the game for a spin in arcade mode, and the port is excellent.  Easy 60 FPS with very few dips to 48 while maxed out at 1360x768, R9 280 and Pentium E6600 with 4GB of RAM.  32-bit users welcome.  Much less CPU-intensive than the original game, and much more optimized for 60 FPS.  Vsync can cause a few strange issues with mouse sensitivity, though.\n\nThe DLC campaign has about two hours of fresh new levels, then goes back to repeat itself three times.  Don't worry; you only cross over some of the centerpieces of each level, and you keep getting exposed to new parts of the levels you haven't visited before.  It's definitely a good campaign, and while it isn't on par with the original (as very few games are), it'll keep you playing for the duration.\n\nMechanically, it's good ol' Alan Wake.  The only change is that you can't just aim at them to burn their shields away.  This time, you HAVE to be boosting your flashlight (right-click) to wear down their shields... which makes combat a little more tense, since your magical shieldbreaker now has limited ammunition.  The dodging mechanic also seems to be a little more responsive, and enemies don't throw ♥♥♥♥ at you nearly as much.\n\nArcade mode was done well, though it could be better.  You start with a 9mm and flashlight, you have an ammo box that comes back every three minutes, a few lights to replenish your health, and you've got 10 minutes until sunrise.  There's also weapons around the map, and a few weapon cases that can only be opened if you collected x number of manuscript pages during the campaign.  You get tons of enemies thrown at you with several variations, and you need to get the highest score you can by avoiding damage and taking out enemies.  Get a high enough rating, and you can unlock the next mission.  There's 5 or 6 stages, and a Nightmare variation (more enemies, constant spawning instead of wave-based) for each.\n\nIs it worth $15?  Yes, but it's not the best game out there.  My recommendation's to save up and buy the Alan Wake Franchise bundle, so you can get both titles.  If in doubt, wait for a Steam sale.","June 24, 2015","true","9.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

As a disclaimer, if you are planning on buying this game because you enjoyed Alan Wake, don't buy it. I bought this game thinking that, like Alan Wake, it would be an exhilarating horror game combined with the elements of a third person shooter. However, this "sequel" seemed more like a dlc which had the horror elements  of Michael Bay buying the franchise. Although there are some horror elements, the idea of this game being scary is a joke. The mediocre story take about 5 good hours to complete which then leaves you to ♥♥♥♥ around on the arcade mode until you finally realize that you are wating your time. The story is nothing special, in which finding all the collectibles was more fun than the actual game itself.  Although settings-wise it lived up to the original, the horror elements of batteries and ammo being limited was replaced with a more shoot-em-up element. Overall, this game disappointed me as it was only a game that I would play if it was the only one in my library.","December 22, 2014","false","12.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/202750/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","I actually liked this more than the regular campaign. This is kind of like a mix between the main campaign and a really basic open-world game.\n\nIt's a lot more open than the main campaign, but it's still rather linear, in that there is only ever one objective that can be done at a time, but you can roam around and explore. The areas aren't very big, and you can't freely travel between them, but this kind of gives me a taste of what the main campaign could have been like if it were designed as an open world game instead of being as utterly claustrophobic as it was.\n\nThis standalone DLC made quite a few changes from the original game, but not all of them were good. In the original Alan Wake, there were 4 weapons. In this one, there are 2 pistols, 2 rifles, 3 shotguns, 2 automatic weapons, a flaregun, and a nailgun. While choice is always good, some of the weapons are insanely overpowered, and some are just pointless. It seems like the developers took people's complaints about the main game's combat system to mean that combat was too difficult (it wasn't), and made it easier. Unfortunately, that means combat is now a cakewalk. Ammo is RIDICULOUSLY plentiful, weapons are insanely powerful, and enemies will barely ever even get close enough to hit you. Throughout the whole game, I got hit maybe 4 times, used 1 handheld flare, never fired the flaregun, and totally forgot I even HAD flashbangs.\n\nThey beefed up the flashlight as well. The enemies seem like they take less light to burn away the darkness, and the flashlight recharges CRAZY fast. From completely empty, it will charge to full in about 3 seconds, including the 1-2 second delay before it even starts charging. I was playing on Normal (there's only normal and nightmare), too, but maybe in this game that's the equivalent of easy.\n\nThe story is still rather interesting in this expansion, but the writing and voice acting are HORRIBLE. I mean absurdly stupid at times. I'm all for campy fun, but sometimes it gets so ridiculous that it really pulls you out of the experience. Speaking of acting, the little "TV" segments where your dark self talks to you go on WAY too long sometimes, and don't really play any importance in how the game unfolds (and you don't get any achievements for them or anything).\n\nOverall I liked this. The story and acting took a step backwards from the main game, but you're not confined to the stupid outdoor tunnel sections (running through the woods), and combat doesn't get in your way as horrifically as it did in the main game either.\n\nIt's rather short, so don't pay $20 for it or anything, but I enjoyed it. Your results may vary, of course.","December 18, 2012","true","5.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

This must be a parody of Alan Wake. There cant be any other conclusion than this easy one. I mean everything, really everything what made Alan Wake a frightening and exciting experience was canceled in this game and replaced by an action based "horror" shooter. I mean Alan with a M16 Fire Rifle? Really?? Dont get me wrong. You will get fun for a few hours. But is this worth the money? That is a question only you can answer to yourself. For me it was since I got this in a damn cheap Alan Wake bundle.\nHowever the pros and cons.\nPros:\n-Funny Shooting\n-The evil Alan Wake in his Lifeaction videos was cool.\nCons:\n-Same location three times (it is the story but it gets boring)\n-Far to easy on normal difficulty (play as nightmare)\n-Story mode is about 2 hours long\n-TERRIBLE Voice Acting\n-Extremly terrible dialogs. The narrator tries so hard to be all that dark and have a meaning full text but a powerful text does not always start with just a noun - a pause - and subsequent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t text. "The observatory." "The village", "A Man and a Woman-" herp derp\n\nI think this game would be much better if they did not try to give it a horror shooter ala Alan Wake atmospheric style. It would be far cooler as a only shooter focused crazy shooter where tons and tons of monster are thrown in your way with hardcore music in the backround. In one minute of the game it has this feeling and it was awesome. I found this YT clip which shows what I mean "/watch?v=dJeDyw2C2h8". If this game was a little bit longer and full of this moments I would recommend it for the money. But as it is now. Not for 9€, not even for 4.50€ with 50% off.\n\nI hope you liked this review and you are a little bit clearer about this game.\n","December 28, 2013","false","2.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Here, it's less walking around and almost purely combat. You get more enemies poured on you and you get a arsenal of guns right out of a action game, like assault rifles, nail gun, uzi, and whatever else. PC Gamer says it's not as good as the first game.

This game is much less story-driven and much more action-driven which I didn't care for.  It's also insanely short.  I beat the game in about 5 hours.  It feels like more of an expansion pack.

That friend has lost his game recommendation priveleges.\n\n~~\n\nAmerican Nightmare is essentially 3 small maps played 3 times over, doing the same things but slightly different each time. The story is presented as to be one of the episodes of "Night Springs", the Twilight Zone-alike from the first game, and narrated by the same Night Springs voice. When the game started and I noticed my flashlight battery went from empty to full in about 3 seconds, and the first gun I was given was a 9mm pistol with a 10 round magazine, I knew I was in for a very different experience.\n\nThe story is passable in as much as I was clamoring for more Alan Wake after the first game, and it satisfied that to a degree. Again, the radio shows are the star here like in the first game, filling in little details about the world and NPCs that you wouldn't otherwise get. This game uses an abundance of the live-action clips that were occasionally used in the first game, to decent effect. Overall the story is nowhere near as good as the first game due to the 'time loop' scenario restraining them from doing any real progress.\n\nAs well, the atmosphere suffers greatly from your trusty revolver and shotgun with limited ammo becoming full auto combat shotguns, submachine guns, assault rifles, and carbines, with boxes that 100% fill your ammo and batteries. It becomes a straight 3rd person shooter with a flashlight gimmick which is unfortunate. That said, the game adds a few more enemy types to make up for your increased firepower, so at least some thought went into the game here.\n\nIt seems that about half of the game's achievements focus around the Arcade portion of the game. I didn't play it because I'd had my fill of the Alan Wake combat, not thta it was necessariyl bad, but that I got plentyof it by the end of American Nightmare. If you enjoyed the combat the Arcade section is likely right up your alley.\n\nAt the end of the day, though it's a decent game, I can't recommend it personally, because as a fan of Alan Wake, this has none of why I liked the original. However, if you liked the gunplay and combat system in Alan Wake, and you're jonesing for a bit more of the story that 'may or ma not have happened' to paraphrase the game, and you can pick it up on sale, you might as well. I got some hours of entertainment, even if it wasn't a good as the first.","November 27, 2014","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I guess I wasn't the only one who felt that way because pretty much all the issues of the first game were fixed with American Nightmare.\n\nI am happy to say that Alan can now run like the middle aged man that he is instead of his ailing grandmother. The card driving issues have been removed entirely, because they don't let you drive in this game. And the camera issues I struggled with were less cumbersome in fights.\n\nAlong with those happy notes, I have to say I think American Nightmare is a great length for an expansion. The story is engaging and interesting, and it develops three more characters in quick order who are all unique. Well... as unique as you can get with stereotypes. But I'm not going down that road.\n\nOut of all the improvements one did shine above all the rest, and that was the decision to have new weapon unlocks correspond with the number of manuscript pages you collect. When I found the first unlock case, I immediately wanted to search the entire map for every last page. Well Done!\n\nIn the end I enjoyed this game much more than the original, and I would say pick this one up on the next steam sale by itself.","November 16, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love this game. It's significantly more combat-oriented than it's predecessor which, in some ways, is nice although it shifts the genre of the game from horror to survival.

Scratch is possibly one of the best and most likeable villains I have come across and I sorely want to see more of him and his manic, devil-may-care attitude about murder and ruining lives. The environments are fun and the upgrades well-placed; I never found the game particularly hard or particularly easy, but just comfortable enough to enjoy the short little novela of the story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonathan-s/recommended/202750/","jonathan-s","jonathan.s","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonathan-s/","142 products in account","I have strongly mixed feelings about this game. It seems like a step down from Alan Wake's deep, psychological undertones, but at the same time I'd like to see more developers take a franchise and just have fun with it in the way that Remedy did with American Nightmare. Overall, Remedy Entertainment just wants to have fun with the Alan Wake universe. I would not be suprised if the game is declared non-canon before Alan Wake 2.\n\nAs a spinoff semi-sequel to the original, it is small and doesn't really connect to the original story or gameplay 'feel' in a satisfying way.\n\nJudged as a standalone game, it's a decent but very short story-driven action game about a guy with a flashlight running around fighting zombies.\n\nThe combat is exactly the same as the first game, but there are a few more weapons to unlock and a few unique enemies.\nThis game is a lot more combat focused, because the atmosphere isn't as heavy as the original and the additional firepower gives the game the ability to send about 50 enemies at you in a continuous wave without you getting axed to death within the first few seconds.\n\nThis game has major issues with longevity. The game literally has you play the same story 3 times with minor variations until you reach a somewhat climactic ending. It seems like a 2-hour gameplay experience copy-pasted to become a 6-hour gameplay experience, with a few extra explory bits here and there. Even in its complete form, it still feels short.\n\nThe story is a bit of a mixed bag. It's well-written, but too short and feels awkward when done three times over.\n\nThere are some other good points though. The recurring characters have some of the best dialogue in the series so far. Alan is as genre-savvy as ever so his second clash with the forces of darkness is enjoyable to watch. Characters from the original game have fantastic cameos that are only there to keep the plot in cryogenic stasis until Alan Wake 2, but still impart how awesome these characters are.\nBut best of all, American Nightmare shows you one of my favorite video game antagonists ever: Mr. Scratch. He's a sarcastic, more psychotic doppelganger of Alan Wake that shows up on TVs throughout the game, mocking you.\n\nIf you're a fan of Alan Wake and you think the game would work with a little more action, then this game is probably for you. If you enjoyed the deeper, more psychological parts of Alan Wake rather than the combat, you'll probably see this as a generic spinoff that won't help you cope with the long wait for Alan Wake 2.\n\nOverall, I had fun, and though I don't think it's as good as Alan Wake, it deserves to be enjoyed just because it doesn't feel obligated to stay in line with the original. If it were marketed as a full sequel, I would be really disappointed, but it's about as much as I would hope for as a side project.","November 8, 2014","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perhaps I should have given some time between the two games, because the transition between the two games was a bit jarring.  American Nightmare, despite the name, lacked much of the horror atmosphere that kept me addicted to the previous game.  It was the little things; like Alan making self-referential wise cracks about his supposedly very serious mission, the much easier enemies, and the dead-panned voice acting of the NPCs.  I did not get the impression that Alan was fighting for his life and that of his wife against an unrelenting horrific force of darkness, but rather this was just something he did that was mildly irritating.  As in: "Eh, it's a job...  BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!!!"\n\nAs for the enemies being weaker, I mean that their darkness was broken much quicker, allowing them to be killed sooner.  A large part of what made Alan Wake challenging was the time needed to weaken enemies before they could be killed.  That gamepley mechanic created many tense situations where I had to dodge an onslaught of enemies while struggling to consistently shine a light on each one, before I could even start to kill them.  This was especially tricky if I ran out of batteries in the middle of the fight, which made the eventual victory all the more rewarding.  In American Nightmare, this feature is weakened, in that I was able to break almost every enemy's darkness before they came within swinging distance of me.\n\nRegretably, this game was also much shorter than the previous one, and I was a bit surprised when I beat it so quickly.  I literally played through the entire campaign in 5 hours.  Now, I did enjoy most of that time, but I was surprised when it ended so soon.  I am not even sure if the campaign is worth playing a second time, because I saw just about every detail available in the 3 main levels the storyline loops you through.\n\nAnd regarding the games looping storyline, I did enjoy the idea of Alan continually improving his strategy on each attempt and how the NPCs started to realize something was up on the second iteration.  I was fondly reminded of the movie "Groundhog Day".  However, the third iteration did not add much more to the story, as both Alan and myself were thinking, "Uh, I have to repeat this all over again..."  Right up until the game ended (too soon), I was hoping there would be more levels and another twist to the story.  Then at the ending scene, I realized that the game's developers had cleverly found a way to make a very short game three times as long...  by making you play it three times over.\n\nDespite all of this, I DO recommend this game to anyone who has played the original Alan Wake or is just looking for a fun action game with some light horror undertones.  I had fun playing it, which is ultimately what I am looking for in any game.","November 3, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A funny concept, like one of those cheesy movies like you've seen so many times, but can't really remember any.\n+A major improvement on original combat system. Now, it's just feels like it have more freedom. Movement have become easier, gunplay is more friendly, overall - feels better now.\n+May I add, that PC port is actually worthwhile? Performance is great, didn't even had to thing about it, no problems have occurred during whole playthrough. Controls are pefrect aswell. It's just feels like it was released on PC in a first place.\n\nCons:\n-Well, it's a good old Alan Wake experience. Meaning repetitive combat which drags through whole game. Things got even worse this time - story became repetitive too. You might get bored pretty soon.\n\nOverall ~ It's a nice spin-off. Althrough, it would not cut for full new continuation/conclusion of the series (well, not so much of the series here, but you get the idea).

Sadly in a negative way. American Nightmere continues the story of titled writer. This time he gets stuck in a horror movie that he used to make scenarios for, called Night Springs.

It allowed them to literally recycle thir product multiple times. Only three maps exist in the game and the only major difference is amount of enemies. This in turn leads to runing out of ammo in the late game, causing multiple, frustrating deaths in row due to lack of melee combat option.\n\nCombat itself is limited to blinding enemies with flashlight which causes them to stop moving and become vunerable for bullets\n\nAll this increases the lenght of the game, it dosenät help much though becouse it took me only 1,5 h to complete whole game.\n\nLuckly the developers had enough reason to remove same aleready done objectives every time i repeated the map, so it aint a complete disaster.\n\nPlot of the game is very similar to another title "Cryostasis", With different location and few combat differenses. For examle you will fight darknes zombies with light and firearms, instead of ice zombies with heat and firearms.\n\nEnding is also quite predictable and resembles cheap horror movies from 1970:s . It causes no satisfaction and makes the whole game being made just for purpose of shooting things and thus moneymaking instead of focusing on quality.\n\n","July 28, 2014","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The major difference between the two games is that AW:AN has a stronger focus on combat, with more weapons and more enemy varieties than in the original game.  I found that I enjoyed it more than the original, mainly because the variety of different enemies kept things from becoming as repetitive (as did a shorter run time).  The thing I liked was that a few of the new enemies weren’t just killed in the same way as every other enemy in the series so alternate strategies had to be used.  As this game focuses more on the action, the horror has mostly been taken out of the game since batteries/ammo are easily replenished.  The original AW had a more interesting story, but the story in this game has some neat ideas and a gimmick that keeps things fun and engaging.","February 13, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mr. Scratch is terrorising nearby towns and turning them into darkness, setting a trap that turns back the time over and over again. Alan Wake travels from place to place: a barren wasteland, to an observatory, and a drive-in theatre, in an attempt to restore light and stop the darkness so he can confront Mr. Scratch and defeat him.\n\nOverall the game is an expansion on that of its predecessor, adding on a variety of weapons that are unlockable by collecting manuscripts, which encourages exploration of the entire map. Unfortunately, the experience is cut short due to the lack of missions available in this expansion.\n\nNonetheless, a decent game and one I would truly recommend if one has completed its predecessor.\nP.S.

It's worth the money in a sale for a quick play but honestly... This game has nothing on the original game.  Very quickly it stands out that the main game mechanic which made this series unique has been tampered with and spoiled... The mechanic I am talking about is light.  Light is the key to defeating the darkness, and no idea lightbulbs went off in the developers heads that made this.\n\nThe First game had little weapons, and had multiple flashlight types, beyond your regular flashlight you could find a heavy duty flashlight and two lantern type lights that in a world of combating darkness was amazing... this game replaces atmosphere and light combat with dumbed down boring gun fighting, many weapons are now available such as an Uzi and M16 and to be blunt... they just dont fit.  The normal light from the flashlight no longer burns away dark... it simply does nothing, you must focus the flashlight to make it do anything... mostly it's just a case of focus light, spray uzi or M16 and repeat now this... is the ultimate sin... They basicly ruined the main combat mechanic that made this game special and replaced it with bland generic shooting.\n\nThere are only three areas in this game, and those get reused several times as a time loop plot device... the ever repeating events become dull and the newer enemys just don't make it interesting enough to make it enjoyable...  infact the other characters remembering the previous loops ahve having previous tasks already finished only highlights the boredom the developers must have realised would happen playing the same content over and over again.\n\nThe first game was dark... VERY dark and the dark fog and shimmering enemys gave me goose bumps... this game did nothing to make me feel dark was dangerous or intimidating, there was no eerie fog everywhere and no sense of dread that made you wish for teh next brightly lit area to come soon... the game just wasn't creapy, spooky, or scary... it just didn't do a good job at all.\n\nThe sandbox arcade mode where you fight till dawn is a fun addition, and it is fun to try and beat your friends scores and try to survive for the full 10 minutes untill dawn... actually that is almost the only time this game seems to remember that light is your ally...\n\nSo as I mentioned...   The game is worth a play as a sale price... it's just nowhere near as good as the first game.","June 5, 2013","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There are a couple of new enemies that I found really interesting (the Splitter and the Birdman) and an interesting twist on gameplay. The live-action cut-scenes were pretty cool, as well.

The graphics are much better, and the mob AI is also improved substantially. The combat has improved 100%, it's actually FUN this time around. The entire weapon system has been redone, allowing you to unlock machene guns, much better flashlights, etc. However, it seems like this add-on to the original took what little story it had, and stretched it so far that it became very bland. No plot twists or any thought provoking mystery. Overall, I enjoyed the game. It only gives you about 6 hours of gameplay, but it's also only $15.\n\nPeople should note that this is not Alan Wake 2 (source: Remedy), and I think this is just a taist of improvements that have been made, although I really hope they get a new idea for the story. Prehaps something seemingly not attached to the previos games. If I see 'Alan Wake 2: The Rise of Mr. Scratch' or 'The Darkness Returns', I think I'm going to throw a fit.","June 20, 2012","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While Alan Wake was tedious and clumsy in movement, American Nightmare  was fluid and fast moving.  American Nightmare took away the lack of ammo element of the game and replaced it with more, faster enemies; a move that made gameplay fun and exhilirating.  The story in American Nightmare was well done with better paced voice acting all around.  In contrast, the original Alan Wake's voice segments were long and tedious.  Manuscript pages were now fun and relevant to find due to a game mechanic that tred the pages to next tier weaponry.  In Alan Wake, I found hunting the pages to be little reward for an often tedious treasure hunt (tedious due to the sloggy feel of Alan Wake in the first game).\n\nI fully recommend the American Nightmare, although a short story style game (less hours), its much more enjoyable in every way than the tedious (unrecommended) Alan Wake.","October 16, 2013","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example: Alan Wake can run way longer than in the original game, in the original game he could run for like 5 bloody seconds. Here he can actually run. Atmosphere is different, but it's actually not bad atmosphere, it suits the whole game and the place where the game takes place in. And shooting is more fun than in the original game, but the thing that really makes this game for me is Mr.Scratch, who I would say might be best villain ever. He's hillariously creepy. He's psychotic killer and he enjoys every moment of it. Game is 6-7 hours long, which is again, not bad. Beacuse the game is cheaper than most games and most games go for bigger price for the same lenght. There is arcade mode, which is very addicting for me and there is so replay value for me. Beating highscores is pretty fun. Story line is still there, and it is good story line. I would give it like: 8-9/10","July 14, 2012","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you crave for some TIME LOOP setting, then your in for a treat. If you hate time loop, you'll dislike this game as you go back in time on the same three levels.\n\nThe atmosphere is still there, giving you a good idea of the messed up mind of Alan... and combatting the Taken again.\n\nI briefly tried that Arcade Mode where you survive wave after wave of Taken. It is okay but not my thing on the long run.\n\nSo I would recommend this game if you loved AW and/or looking into something different for a change.

Its narrative is related to the rest of the series, contrary to my initial reaction, and it drops some interesting tidbits about what's happening outside Alan Wake's insane dreamworld, but much of the dialogue and voice acting is pathetic (with the exception of the guy voicing Mr. Scratch and Alan). I did not like the shift in tone at first, but eventually it was justified by the narrative. That said, I really hope they return to the darker, horror-based tone of the rest of the series for the next true installment (which I fear might not come for a while). The graphics rival those of the previous entries, but the cinematics are cheesy live action video clips that are at times cringeworthy. Fans of the series who are craving to find out what the hell happened in that huge cliffhanger at the end of the first one and its subsequent DLC should definitely give this a try, just to hear the juicy hints about what actually happened. That said, Remedy needs to finally bring this story back into the real world and answer some questions, rather than keep producing hints about what is actually happening in this story. Otherwise I fear that one of my favorite tales in gaming might just fly off the rails.","July 10, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is actually more fun in this one and each combat sequence seems to actually have a sense of purpose. The game itself felt fairly short but the story did pick up where the first game left off and I was pleased with the way it all turned out. Although you can technically play this game without having experiencing the story of the first, I recommend you don't because there are quite a few spoilers since the story takes place about two years after the original. Still, if you just want a fairly quick single-player experience to run through, this game shouldn't take more than a day to complete.

Sadly in a negative way. American Nightmere continues the story of titled writer. This time he gets stuck in a horror movie that he used to make scenarios for, called Night Springs.  Intro movie displays a viewer that fell asleep while the program was on. Results are the same for the player. Developers got an idea to use a time twist physics theory. It allowed them to literally recycle thir product multiple times. Only three maps exist in the game and the only major difference is amount of enemies. This in turn leads to runing out of ammo in the late game, causing multiple, frustrating deaths in row due to lack of melee combat option.\n\nCombat itself is limited to blinding enemies with flashlight which causes them to stop moving and become vunerable for bullets\n\nAll this increases the lenght of the game, it dosenät help much though becouse it took me only 1,5 h to complete whole game.\n\nLuckly the developers had enough reason to remove same aleready done objectives every time i repeated the map, so it aint a complete disaster.\n\nPlot of the game is very similar to another title "Cryostasis", With different location and few combat differenses. For examle you will fight darknes zombies with light and firearms, instead of ice zombies with heat and firearms.\n\nEnding is also quite predictable and resembles cheap horror movies from 1970:s . It causes no satisfaction and makes the whole game being made just for purpose of shooting things and thus moneymaking instead of focusing on quality.\n\n","July 28, 2014","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You, the Champion of Light have to defeat your evil double, the Herald of Darkness by doing various tasks to rewrite reality and kill said evil double, who plans on taking your place in the world and ruining everything.\n\nThe combat is improved from the original. The enemies have less light health than before and your flashlight only depletes light health when you are amplifying the light like in the original. You have access to more powerful weapons sooner, and can get even better weapons collecting the manuscript pages and using them to unlock weapon cases. The game gives out ammo like candy at least on normal difficulty, so there isn't much stress about bullet levels.\n\nIt appears to run on the same base engine that Alan Wake ran on, so the graphical quality and style mostly remains the same. The voice acting never really gets cringeworthy, and the music fits the right moments.\n\nIt's pretty good overall. The combat is better, the story is different and NOT a continuation of Alan Wake, you will go through three main areas in the game. It runs pretty short at around 3 hours. It feels more like a standalone DLC to Alan Wake rather than it's own game, and for 15 dollars I feel it is worth it. It is entertaining throughout the whole time, though the ending might leave some wanting more.\n\nIf you liked Alan Wake you will probably like this, and it probably won't sell too many people who didn't like it.

The environments are fun and the upgrades well-placed; I never found the game particularly hard or particularly easy, but just comfortable enough to enjoy the short little novela of the story.

Well, because this game really doesn't offer anything that the original didn't.

While the previous predecesor explained his ability to change reality through writing only gave him the briefest glimmers of hope, this rendition allows gamers to experience a writer's power trip, one that allows Alan to quite literally rock the heavens after some careful planning and skill.\n\nA special mention must also be given to the game's villian, Mr. Scratch. While the idea of an evil twin is a bit of a cliche, Mr. Scratch's showboating in everything he does is consistently entertaining. Few times  has a villian been so intriguing just through sheer personality and charisma.","February 1, 2013","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Es war dunkel und der Charakter erhob sich zum ersten Mal aus dem Dreck. Wir starten das Spiel mit einer Taschenlampe und einer Pistole. Man versteht schnell wie es funktioniert: Taschenlampe auf den Gegner, warten, schießen. Jeder Gegner in diesem Spiel lässt sich auf diese Weise ohne Probleme erledigen. Die Steuerung und die Grafik haben mir gefallen.\nKommen wir nun zum eigentlichem Problem von Alan Wake´s American Nightmare, man steht wie ich schon sagte aus dem Dreck auf, erledigt Aufgaben (Dreh das Ventil zu, mach dies, mach das) und kommt durch 4 verschiedene Level die zu einem Showdown mit sich selbst führen. Ja, man kämpft gegen sein böses Ich. Leider hat "ALAN" aber etwas vergessen, also steht er wieder am Start auf. Ich lachte  und dachte mir:" Na, was kommt jetzt". Richtig, das ganze Spiel nochmal, mit geringen Abweichungen. Als ich dann endlich wieder beim Endgegner angekommen war und das Spiel nun zwei mal gesehen hatte passierte das Unvorstellbare. Ich stand wieder am Anfang. Mir standen bereits die Haare zu Berge, da der Charakter scheinbar immer wieder Teile zu vergessen scheint. Man sieht also wieder die gleichen Leute und die gleichen Orte, mit nur geringen Abweichungen in den Aufgaben. Den Rest kennt ihr ja und ihr wacht wieder auf. Dann spielt ihr das ganze nochmal, und fertig. Spiel vorbei. Spielzeit? Unter 4 Stunden. War es die 10,00-15,00€ Wert? Nein.

The manuscripts, radio shows and TV spots add back story and new content. The gameplay is pretty solid with a more arcade style of fighting, which makes for a much easier game. The game is worth buying if you are interested in a continuation of the story, if you enjoy arcade shooters with leaderboards and you're not looking for a long storymode, I completed it in less than 5 hours.\n\nScore\n6/10 - I give the game a 6/10 based on the facts that I am more interested in the storymode vs arcade gameplay. I feel good knowing I got the game for less than $10.\n","August 23, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It includes timeloops, and the protagonist, Alan Wake, hunting through the Time Loop to find his twin, Mr. Scratch. It's essentially an aftermath, kind of, to Alan Wake, diving deeper into the characters, with backstories for Mr. Scratch, Barry, three new characters, Alice, and even Alan himself.\n\nIt is a relatively short game, I bought it earlier today and beat it in a few hours. It's understandable though, being as it's an "arcade" game on Xbox Live, and they're not meant to be a whole game, American Nightmare included, having only three seperate areas. Also, no true in-game cinematics.\n\nThe ending is also kind of iffy. I'm not going to spoil it, but a few people might not enjoy it as much. Either way, it's an okay game and I recommend it. Alan Wake is a good series, and American Nightmare comes with something that I wished for half-way through the original game, an Arcade mode.

The story places Alan in an episode of 'Night Springs' (Twighlight Zone Parody), complete with bad voiceover guy and in general has a quite different 'feel' to the original being set in Arizona not spooky woodland. Gameplay has been expanded to include new enemies and weapons and it could be argued that this is simplay an expansion to set Alan in a more combat heavy role - as such the tension has been wound back, but I liked the feel of it.

But it also seems to be a tad bit easier, but that could just be the difficulty setting I chose (I chose normal, but there is no "Easy" in AN like there was in Alan Wake, making the Normal the easier of the two difficulty options). They've also done away with many of the horror-esque elements. I'd classify this as a thriller, more than anything else. All in game cut scenes have also been replaced with live-action ones, which I thought was very interesting. They're were well done too.

It was a neat story, and a neat idea, and the combat was something out of the ordinary. Seems like it wouldn't be hard to follow up, right?\n\nAmerican Nightmare almost seems like a demo for the whole game. The conciet of the plot in this iteration is that our hero is caught in a time loop, but effectively what this translates to is that you go through the same 3 small areas 3 times. There are no "episodes", there is no getting from point A to point B, you simply "win" the particular scene by progressing the story along, and are immediately greeted with a loading screen, taking you straight to the next area. Meanwhile the combat, while interesting in the first game, has not changed at all in this second, and every single enemy can be taken down the exact same way. Shine the light, shoot bullets. A little added variety would have done a bit to save it, but not much.\n\nAdditionally, the story itself seems a bit muddied and vague, although given how much space they gave themselves to work with, it's surprising they managed to convey a cohesive story in such a small span of game. The badguy is bad, the good guy is good, he wins, and everything is fine. The credits then tell us that we haven't seen the last of Mr. Wake, but for the audience's sake, I hope Alan has brushed up on his writing skills.\n\n\n"I found this game shallow and pedantic."\n-Peter Griffin","June 6, 2014","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overhaul of the flashlight system isn't really good or bad, but the classic campaign weapons got a serious reworking and they added a ton of new ones to boot.  They also added a lot more ammo—too much actually. Sure I ran out of ammo a few times but that was because I never bothered to run away or conserve—there was no need to. I could just stand around blasting Taken until my heart’s content and then go to the restock station. It really took away from the feel of the original game; not needing to ever really worry if you have enough to make it to the next checkpoint. Arcade mode is actually quite fun and a great option if you want to play something but don’t really want to get too involved. If you want to use any of the new weapons in Arcade mode, you need to play though the campaign as you now collect manuscript pages to unlock the new weapons.","February 8, 2013","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game basically takes the "Night Springs" parody of the Twilight Zone included in the original, and incorporates Alan Wake into it.  The story is a small continuation of where Alan Wake left off, but more of a hold over than a true sequel.\n\nGameplay is linear just like in the first game but gunplay is way more extensive.  The fights have many more enemies simultaneously and there are far more weapons to choose from.  Also, for some reason they took away the flashlights passive damage to shadow shields.  Now you always have to burst the flashlight to damage the shadows.  There are essentially 3 maps than you have to replay 3 times due to a "time trap".  I won't ruin the story but I never found it monotonous since the playthrough changes slightly each time.\n\nThat said, this is definitely something to just hold you over until a true sequel to Alan Wake comes out.

American Nightmare still has a similar method of storytelling as the main game, and now features a truly psychotic villain. Now assuming you've played Alan Wake, here's what's new in American Nightmare. There are several new enemies with unique abilities. Several new weapons. A slightly modified HUD which has a more modern look to it. There is only 1 type of flashlight. Batteries fully recharge in about 2 seconds. Ammo is no longer scarce, with ammo boxes that completely resupply you with ammo and batteries. These boxes also replenish after a couple of minutes. Since you have more ammo, you will also be fighting more enemies at any given time. The overall game has a more action-arcade feel to it.

The manuscripts, radio shows and TV spots add back story and new content. The gameplay is pretty solid with a more arcade style of fighting, which makes for a much easier game.

It includes timeloops, and the protagonist, Alan Wake, hunting through the Time Loop to find his twin, Mr. Scratch. It's essentially an aftermath, kind of, to Alan Wake, diving deeper into the characters, with backstories for Mr. Scratch, Barry, three new characters, Alice, and even Alan himself.\n\nIt is a relatively short game, I bought it earlier today and beat it in a few hours. It's understandable though, being as it's an "arcade" game on Xbox Live, and they're not meant to be a whole game, American Nightmare included, having only three seperate areas. Also, no true in-game cinematics.\n\nThe ending is also kind of iffy. I'm not going to spoil it, but a few people might not enjoy it as much. Either way, it's an okay game and I recommend it. Alan Wake is a good series, and American Nightmare comes with something that I wished for half-way through the original game, an Arcade mode.

In a way it started out as a nice, albeit quite cheesy, video game based off of the original. The narrative, one of the best things of the previous title, is extremely silly. A complete joke compared to the original. The game has you explore a handful of regions three times in a row, explained in the story as some kind of time cycle or trial-and-error run as Alan Wake tries to re-write his story. As far as gameplay is concerned, it means you'll spend doing roughly the same stuff over and over again and simply feels lazy on the part of the developers. The areas are okay, certainly not as atmospheric as the Pacific North West of the original. The game is considerably short as well, clocking in at three hours at most (I've finished my run in 2.5 hours). As short as it is, the game actually starts to drag halfway through since there isn't any new in terms of scenery. Gameplay-wise, however, it is as solid as the previous title. The enemies are diverse and the gunplay, mixed with the light mechanic, still feels as fresh as in the original. Ammunition is less scarce so the survival aspect that was present in the original is gone (safe havens are also more frequent), though this isn't all too bad. As a standalone it is hard to recommend, though I guess it should be seen as more of an expansion or perhaps (standalone) DLC. Taking the price-tag into account, I'm giving the game the benefit of the doubt. I feel the gameplay is enough to carry it.\n\nBottom line is that it is a fun game to kill an evening, but don't expect this to be "Alan Wake 2".","September 1, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a stand-alone DLC that continues the story of the original Alan Wake game.\n\nYou play as Alan again fighting against his evil alter-ego and his minions of darkness.  He still wields up to six weapons – 1-hand gun, 2-hand gun, flare gun, flares, flashbang grenades and, most crucial, a flashlight.  The flashlight is required to remove the enemy shields in order to make them vulnerable to your guns.  Ammo (and batteries for your flashlight) are everywhere and there are quite a few more guns to choose from.\n\nThe story this time around pits you against your doppelganger, created by the Dark Presence.  There are some new interesting variations on the minions you face which helps against monotony.   What doesn’t help is that the three zones that the story takes you through get re-used three times each, creating nine areas to complete the game.  They do their creative best to make things a little different each time through, but there is no way to hide the inevitable repetition.\n\nThe graphics have been slightly updated from the original.  There are some great cutscenes and the voice acting is still superb.  The real life actor playing Alan Wake has some choice scenes playing the evil twin and taunting Alan through videos you can play on various TV sets.\n\nThey have toned down the many collectibles from the first game.  There are 50+ manuscript pages to find and these provide story exposition and are required to unlock better weapons.  Likewise, there are only 12 achievements now and half are associated with the new Arcade Mode.  Arcade Mode removes the storyline completely and allows the player to try and survive the night in different maps against waves of enemies.  You can compare your scores against your friends….still no co-op or multi-player available.\n\nAmerican Nightmare’s Story Mode can easily be completed in less than five hours, although the Arcade Mode can provide some additional hours of fun.  Overall, worth playing if you wait for the right Steam sale.","September 7, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it a sequel? No, not really. Is it a DLC? No, it is stand-alone. I guess then we can call it an expansion pack.\n\nThe story is pretty short compared to the first Alan Wake, but it is kept interesting by fast pacing and a great progression of story elements.\n\nThis time, the story is narrated as if it were an episode of Night Springs (Twilight Zone). I absolutely adore this homage, and palying through and hearing the narration in this way really made me enjoy it more.\n\nThe videos you see on the random TVs are mainly Mr. Scratch addressing Alan directly. We get to see how twisted he is, and how he delights in what he does. I think this was a great addition to the game's story elements.\n\nShooting, the flashlight, the HUD, and a bunch of other mechanics have been streamlined to be faster. You're more agile and nimble, and combat is much more fast due to this. This takes some of the tension of the story mode, but it is still enjoyable.\n\nThere are tons of new weapons, with some great cameos by the m14, m4, and the AA-12, as well as the MAC-10.\n\nI'm not interested in the Arcade mode, but I've played a round and I can see it being enjoyable and challenging.\n\nAll in all, an excellent expansion to Alan Wake that clarifies some things and mystifies some even further.\n\nTotally worth it if you loved Alan Wake.","December 11, 2012","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Replaying the same three levels multiple times with minor variations can become slightly tedious.\n\nThe payoff at the end is tough to swallow. This subplot wraps itself up abruptly and no one knows if the new revelations are canon. Fortunately, the journey to this sorry conclusion is a fun one. Combat is unchanged, a handful of new enemies are introduced, and NPC's are more colorful. But most significant is the wider variety of weapons, which unfortunately makes the game a whole lot easier.\n\nAt full price, American Nightmare is still a good buy, especially with the new survival mode, which tacks on extra hours of fun.\n\nGrade: B","May 26, 2012","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

American Nightmare requires no knowledge of the first game, and plays out like a twisted Twilight Zone episode. Mr Scratch was fascinating to watch on every TV I found. Great actor. The soundtrack was much more limited than Alan Wake's and thats my only real gripe. The combat and gameplay felt MUCH better here, more responsive. The arcade mode may keep you hooked for a while too. Considering this is usually half the price of Alan Wake, I think it's a better deal.","April 10, 2013","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fighting is fun, the mechanics are ok, but the game is never really creepy the way Resident Evil 4's opening was. It's not really a horror game, it's more of a supernatural shooter with some ok mechanics. What I think might make Alan Wake important is what it raises about triple A games and why some games become flagships like Halo or Uncharted and some end up like Alan Wake, because this is really not that different than any other blockbuster I've played recently. That said it's a horror game we're you're supposed to be afraid of what's out there, but then has a collection mechanic and more ammo drops than bad guys.

If you go into it thinking that, you will be disappointed. But the story remains interesting and does a great job of maintaining the meta-narrative set up in Alan Wake and the 2 DLC episodes, "The Signal" and "The Writer",  that make the game so unique.\n\nWhether it's as good as Alan Wake or not, that's hard to say because American Nightmare really is a different game. Many of the mechanics are the same, although I would say even refined a bit, and the story stays true to the characters, but it has a different look and feel to it, and I think the developer's decision to do that was actually pretty brilliant. It plays out like novella, which fits the theme well.\n\nMr. Scratch is truly a disturbing antagonist. He's not funny, he's not charming. He's...off. His timing seems to be lacking, as if he's figured out how to look the part, but not the nuances of how to act around people. Ilkka Villa's performace of the two is brilliant, and the voice over work by Matthew Paretti is fantastic.\n\nIt's not perfect, but it does a good job of holding you over and giving you a slighly more hopeful ending than the original game...at least until we get more Alan Wake.","March 24, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A funny concept, like one of those cheesy movies like you've seen so many times, but can't really remember any.\n+A major improvement on original combat system. Now, it's just feels like it have more freedom. Movement have become easier, gunplay is more friendly, overall - feels better now.\n+May I add, that PC port is actually worthwhile? Performance is great, didn't even had to thing about it, no problems have occurred during whole playthrough. Controls are pefrect aswell. It's just feels like it was released on PC in a first place.\n\nCons:\n-Well, it's a good old Alan Wake experience. Meaning repetitive combat which drags through whole game. Things got even worse this time - story became repetitive too. You might get bored pretty soon.\n\nOverall ~ It's a nice spin-off. Althrough, it would not cut for full new continuation/conclusion of the series (well, not so much of the series here, but you get the idea).

This is not a long game, this is not an Alan Wake 2.  It is a small adventure to burn through in a long night.  The original Alan Wake game had some issues, combat and running could be a pain, some elements were left over from previous builds, somethings just didn't work right together.  American Nightmare delivers a tighter experience.  Combat is given a boost with new enemies and new weapons, and running away is now an option.  Ammo and weapons stay with you, while there's many ammo depots with infinite ammo around, this at least means when you find a weapon you like you're not going to lose it for the next scene or segment.  Driving is gone.  The darkness don't talk nearly as much, they still say a few things, but gone are the long winded reciting the rules of the park.\n\nThe story is not for everyone, be warned, it is groundhog day over three maps, and its "style" is prevelant, there's a scene you'll see more than once where a song is playing over a satellite falling from space into an oil pump and then it all explodes.  It is a style I'm fond of, and really enjoyed here.  To me, it feels like more of Barry and his Little Monsters moment of covering himself in christmas and flood lights to battle the darkness.  Fun, silly, with a few touches of creepy.","June 24, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its narrative is related to the rest of the series, contrary to my initial reaction, and it drops some interesting tidbits about what's happening outside Alan Wake's insane dreamworld, but much of the dialogue and voice acting is pathetic (with the exception of the guy voicing Mr. Scratch and Alan). I did not like the shift in tone at first, but eventually it was justified by the narrative. That said, I really hope they return to the darker, horror-based tone of the rest of the series for the next true installment (which I fear might not come for a while). The graphics rival those of the previous entries, but the cinematics are cheesy live action video clips that are at times cringeworthy. Fans of the series who are craving to find out what the hell happened in that huge cliffhanger at the end of the first one and its subsequent DLC should definitely give this a try, just to hear the juicy hints about what actually happened. That said, Remedy needs to finally bring this story back into the real world and answer some questions, rather than keep producing hints about what is actually happening in this story. Otherwise I fear that one of my favorite tales in gaming might just fly off the rails.","July 10, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, the game is but a sideshow to the fantastic "Alan Wake" (and not a sequel in any way) and it does have a more arcady feeling to it, but the world of Alan Wake is deep and mysterious in many ways and "American Nightmare" does add depth to it. The action is perhaps more refined and the weapns and enemies more diverse, but the introduction of the antagonist, Mr. Scratch, the homicidal alter ego of Alan Wake, is pure fantastic.

The longevity of the game lies within its plot: Alan Wake is put into a time loop by his sinister doppelganger, Mr. Scratch. Replaying the same three levels multiple times with minor variations can become slightly tedious.\n\nThe payoff at the end is tough to swallow. This subplot wraps itself up abruptly and no one knows if the new revelations are canon. Fortunately, the journey to this sorry conclusion is a fun one. Combat is unchanged, a handful of new enemies are introduced, and NPC's are more colorful. But most significant is the wider variety of weapons, which unfortunately makes the game a whole lot easier.\n\nAt full price, American Nightmare is still a good buy, especially with the new survival mode, which tacks on extra hours of fun.\n\nGrade: B","May 26, 2012","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The arcade ‘horde’ mode although fairly entertaining isn’t particularly good enough od enough to warrant return visits or to even offer a great deal of extended game-play… I guess, buying American Nightmare in the sales on Steam for a quick action experience is fair enough but I’d avoid this game at standard price, there just simply isn’t enough content to justify it!

It doesn't have quite the survival horror feel of the original; a hugely expanded arsenal of weapons makes defeating Taken a pleasure rather than a struggle. The option to turn off motion blur is the single greatest change between the two games, and it makes American Nightmare much more enjoyable.

This isn't to say it plays bad, it handles the gunplay very well, it just plays second-fiddle to the games narrative focus. New enemy types and new weapons help greatly, but you still stick around for the story of Alan's battle against the dark presence.  This short expidition has Alan face off against his dark counterpart "Mr Scratch" as he attempts to write his way out of the "Dark place". The live action TV scenes where Mr Scratch talks to Alan are highly entertaining as you watch the crazy fly. The game keeps it breif and enjoyable, but by the end you'll be sick of hearing Kasabian's "Club Foot".\n\nThe first is a must play before this, but if you enjoyed the full length mystery of Alan's trip to Bright Falls you'll enjoy his shorter vacation to Night Springs.","July 20, 2012","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story will last around four hours and the Arcade Mode will keep you coming back if you enjoy that type of gameplay. Thinking about it now, Arcade Mode is a great feature and shows that the combat in American Nightmare is enjoyable and works, even when it’s used for scoring based gameplay. I hope Remedy takes this idea and builds on it in the sequel, but while we are waiting for Alan Wake 2, you can take part in this direct-to-DVD addition to the Alan Wake franchise that fans will most likely want to do.","December 26, 2013","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This sequel to Alan Wake is odd.\n\nIt's short, for one thing. The story mode took me 6 hours. The story continues where Alan Wake left off, but doesn't do much to make the plot any clearer. The beginning is confusing, the middle you understand and then the ending is sudden with a lot of questions unanswered and literally no final boss fight.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay you know and love from Alan Wake isn't here anymore. Where Alan Wake used to make you scavenge for ammo, always making you count your bullets and making you panic whenever combat starts; American Nightmare shoves ammo down your throat, combat is easy (especially if you've played the previous game) and the game plays less with the fear of darkness. So gameplay is definitely changed into more action-y, and although this is explained in game.\n\nSo is American Nightmare a bad game? No... but I definitely have the feeling this isn't a sequel, just a glorified DLC. Was it fun to play though? Yes. It was. Should you get this game if you haven't played Alan Wake? No. Should you get it if you have? Definitely... but don't expect another game of equal quality.\n\nThe Good: Little more light-hearted than AW, more guns, Arizona is a welcome change from Bright Falls.\nThe Bad: Why change a winning formula, repeats levels, story is still vague, sudden ending, ridiculously short.\n6/10","November 8, 2013","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From what I understand it's the continuation of the story and was intended to be either released episodically or as a stop gap between the first and second game. Sadly there isn't any news on a second game coming so far, beyond the 'to be continued' that you get at the end credits.\n\nAnyway, the game itself is pretty good. It hasn't lost any of the voice acting or nice little bits. The Alan Wake series is one of the few games that actually makes me want to collect the collectibles,, which in this cases are manuscript pages that can be read. Each page reveals more of the world so The player can understand the world more.\nThis title is a lot more combat orientated that the original with more varied enemies and tougher ones at that. Not to worry though your arsenal can be upgraded through weapons cases that are unlocked by finding the aforementioned collectibles. 3 gets you an smg, 10 a magnum and so on.\n\nI'd recommend this game, it's actually worth it's asking price, though replayability is low. There is a arcade mode that can make the game last a bit longer. Be aware that you really do need to like plot heavy games to really enjoy this title.\n\n","April 16, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a stand-alone DLC that continues the story of the original Alan Wake game.\n\nYou play as Alan again fighting against his evil alter-ego and his minions of darkness.  He still wields up to six weapons – 1-hand gun, 2-hand gun, flare gun, flares, flashbang grenades and, most crucial, a flashlight.  The flashlight is required to remove the enemy shields in order to make them vulnerable to your guns.  Ammo (and batteries for your flashlight) are everywhere and there are quite a few more guns to choose from.\n\nThe story this time around pits you against your doppelganger, created by the Dark Presence.  There are some new interesting variations on the minions you face which helps against monotony.   What doesn’t help is that the three zones that the story takes you through get re-used three times each, creating nine areas to complete the game.  They do their creative best to make things a little different each time through, but there is no way to hide the inevitable repetition.\n\nThe graphics have been slightly updated from the original.  There are some great cutscenes and the voice acting is still superb.  The real life actor playing Alan Wake has some choice scenes playing the evil twin and taunting Alan through videos you can play on various TV sets.\n\nThey have toned down the many collectibles from the first game.  There are 50+ manuscript pages to find and these provide story exposition and are required to unlock better weapons.  Likewise, there are only 12 achievements now and half are associated with the new Arcade Mode.  Arcade Mode removes the storyline completely and allows the player to try and survive the night in different maps against waves of enemies.  You can compare your scores against your friends….still no co-op or multi-player available.\n\nAmerican Nightmare’s Story Mode can easily be completed in less than five hours, although the Arcade Mode can provide some additional hours of fun.  Overall, worth playing if you wait for the right Steam sale.","September 7, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Es war dunkel und der Charakter erhob sich zum ersten Mal aus dem Dreck. Wir starten das Spiel mit einer Taschenlampe und einer Pistole. Man versteht schnell wie es funktioniert: Taschenlampe auf den Gegner, warten, schießen. Jeder Gegner in diesem Spiel lässt sich auf diese Weise ohne Probleme erledigen. Die Steuerung und die Grafik haben mir gefallen.\nKommen wir nun zum eigentlichem Problem von Alan Wake´s American Nightmare, man steht wie ich schon sagte aus dem Dreck auf, erledigt Aufgaben (Dreh das Ventil zu, mach dies, mach das) und kommt durch 4 verschiedene Level die zu einem Showdown mit sich selbst führen. Ja, man kämpft gegen sein böses Ich. Leider hat "ALAN" aber etwas vergessen, also steht er wieder am Start auf. Ich lachte  und dachte mir:" Na, was kommt jetzt". Richtig, das ganze Spiel nochmal, mit geringen Abweichungen. Als ich dann endlich wieder beim Endgegner angekommen war und das Spiel nun zwei mal gesehen hatte passierte das Unvorstellbare. Ich stand wieder am Anfang. Mir standen bereits die Haare zu Berge, da der Charakter scheinbar immer wieder Teile zu vergessen scheint. Man sieht also wieder die gleichen Leute und die gleichen Orte, mit nur geringen Abweichungen in den Aufgaben. Den Rest kennt ihr ja und ihr wacht wieder auf. Dann spielt ihr das ganze nochmal, und fertig. Spiel vorbei. Spielzeit? Unter 4 Stunden. War es die 10,00-15,00€ Wert? Nein.

Neverthless, the style is quite intriguing and while not being entirely unique you happen to walk through several beatiful settings (which sadly happen to repeat a lot, though).\n\nEverything gameplay related and possibly voice actors related is literally ported from the earlier Alan Wake, with the benefits and drawback of a game that by now is a few years old. The engine still does its job but you'll happen to feel a need for something fresh, which is quite likely the point where the soundtrack excels (with some impressive - and fun - moments).\n\nOverall it's a good game, but it could have been a much more interesting project if it wasn't going to be an Alan Wake spin off (you still feel like playing a game that was crumped a bit to fit either budget limits or time deadines).","November 2, 2013","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally an Xbox live title this has made its way over to the PC with a few tweaks.\n\nGraphics are not powerhouse hungry but its not going to make you vomit in disgust at its admitadly bland pallet. As this game is set mostly in the desert with minimal indoor environmets this game is no stranger to the colour brown. The PC version does look better than its console sibling with AA options and a HD texture pack.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the main game with a familar over the shoulder third person camera with a reasonable FOV. Ok its a very console orientated FOV and this game does play better with a gamepad than a keyboard and mouse although you want cry and bang your head on the desk if you dont have a gamepad. So I would recommend plugging in a pad and scooting your chair back a tad for a more comforatable experience. The weapons have a nice feel to them, the traditional pistol, rifle and shotgun are back with interesting additions such as the nail gun. There is enough variety of weapons around and plenty of ammo to keep gameplay fresh.\n\nThe flashlight returns to burn off the "Darkness" which acts as a shield to enemies making them imune to bullets. But like in the main game the enemies are vunerable to all forms of lights, whether this is car headlights, flares or the sun.\n\nThe game lets face it is not very long. The story mode takes about 3/4 hours to complete but considering this started out as an xbox live arcade expansion this is not a bad thing. Especially when the game costs less than a pint. New to American Nightmare is an arcade mode. This is basically a horde mode escape the zombies make it till dawn affair. It has a couple of achievements and map unlocks but single player means its not something you are going to come back to.\n\nSo should you buy it? Have you played Alan Wake? If not go pick that up. Its not expensive, has a great story in the style of Stephen King novels. This game is a bit of an oddball rounding off the story that a lot of people expected from the main game. If you have played the base game, then deffinately pick this up. Although a little repeptive in the story it provides a better finish to the story you got so into in the previous incarnation.\n","January 2, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it also seems to be a tad bit easier, but that could just be the difficulty setting I chose (I chose normal, but there is no "Easy" in AN like there was in Alan Wake, making the Normal the easier of the two difficulty options). They've also done away with many of the horror-esque elements. I'd classify this as a thriller, more than anything else. All in game cut scenes have also been replaced with live-action ones, which I thought was very interesting. They're were well done too. The game does well as a stand alone, providing good closure for the events of the previous game, whilst simultaneously giving sufficient background information to those who haven't played the original.

Neverthless, the style is quite intriguing and while not being entirely unique you happen to walk through several beatiful settings (which sadly happen to repeat a lot, though).\n\nEverything gameplay related and possibly voice actors related is literally ported from the earlier Alan Wake, with the benefits and drawback of a game that by now is a few years old. The engine still does its job but you'll happen to feel a need for something fresh, which is quite likely the point where the soundtrack excels (with some impressive - and fun - moments).\n\nOverall it's a good game, but it could have been a much more interesting project if it wasn't going to be an Alan Wake spin off (you still feel like playing a game that was crumped a bit to fit either budget limits or time deadines).","November 2, 2013","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally an Xbox live title this has made its way over to the PC with a few tweaks.\n\nGraphics are not powerhouse hungry but its not going to make you vomit in disgust at its admitadly bland pallet. As this game is set mostly in the desert with minimal indoor environmets this game is no stranger to the colour brown. The PC version does look better than its console sibling with AA options and a HD texture pack.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the main game with a familar over the shoulder third person camera with a reasonable FOV. Ok its a very console orientated FOV and this game does play better with a gamepad than a keyboard and mouse although you want cry and bang your head on the desk if you dont have a gamepad. So I would recommend plugging in a pad and scooting your chair back a tad for a more comforatable experience. The weapons have a nice feel to them, the traditional pistol, rifle and shotgun are back with interesting additions such as the nail gun. There is enough variety of weapons around and plenty of ammo to keep gameplay fresh.\n\nThe flashlight returns to burn off the "Darkness" which acts as a shield to enemies making them imune to bullets. But like in the main game the enemies are vunerable to all forms of lights, whether this is car headlights, flares or the sun.\n\nThe game lets face it is not very long. The story mode takes about 3/4 hours to complete but considering this started out as an xbox live arcade expansion this is not a bad thing. Especially when the game costs less than a pint. New to American Nightmare is an arcade mode. This is basically a horde mode escape the zombies make it till dawn affair. It has a couple of achievements and map unlocks but single player means its not something you are going to come back to.\n\nSo should you buy it? Have you played Alan Wake? If not go pick that up. Its not expensive, has a great story in the style of Stephen King novels. This game is a bit of an oddball rounding off the story that a lot of people expected from the main game. If you have played the base game, then deffinately pick this up. Although a little repeptive in the story it provides a better finish to the story you got so into in the previous incarnation.\n","January 2, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked the original game; but, this game was just tedious.\n\nWhere I think it fails:\n- It brings next to nothing new from the original game so there's no mystery\n- Game-play is way too repetitive and offers nothing we haven't already seen\n- Theme/Environment/Mood is isolated, lonely, and lacks interactivity\n- As you progress in the game, nothing changes,same predictable crap, etc.\n- The hidden pages don't offer much; they say a whole lot of the same exact thing\n- The game is neither action, nor is a horror/thriller; rather, it seems like a feeble attempt at a mystery/adventure without enough story to make it so\n- The game feels confined (which is good for horror titles) but it's just a put-off in this case\n- This game makes it apparent that Alan Wake is suffering from a form of severe bi-polar dementia or schizophrenia, representing parts of his segmented life through each character, periodically relating to story lines from his previous writings (mainly 'The Hero of Light"), and that there is no Mr. Scratch at all (as opposed to the original game, which left you wondering).\n- The game lacks character, no humor, nothing interesting or thought provoking (except the 'i don't wanna be good; I wanna be nasty...' part. I gotta admit that caught me off guard).\n\nDevelopers: The writer is doing his job; please do something with the gameplay in the next release. I can see benefit in adding dark-themed side missions that shed light on Wake's relationships with various people in his life, facing the reality that he's demented and needs help (kind of like in "A Beautiful Mind"), or something of the sort.

The combat is really fun and the story keeps you there for ~4 hours it last. The only bad thing is that you do the story more then once in order to continue the story.","September 7, 2013","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not sure if I'm going to play the arcade mode - tried one and completed it on normal mode, but really not that impressed about wave-survival-stuff of that particular genre.\nOver-all decent game, although fairly cheap in its construction in regards to level creation - you play the same level multiple times with minor changes.... but the story told is decent and if you take the time to read the notes and watch the television 'shows' it's definitely money well spent.\n7/10 I do recommend.","July 4, 2013","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
