"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/306700/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Long before the likes of Geometry Wars or Waves, twin stick shooting gameplay has been reimagined countless times since the 80's first gave us classics like Robotron or Berzerk. Introducing the directional shooting and arena based challenges was the start of a new genre, and soon we saw deeper level progression in the form of dungeon crawlers like Gauntlet or SMASH T.V. Iron Fisticle seeks to bring modern twin-stick action and 80's arcade arena shooting into a classic RPG setting of medieval madness.\n\nIron Fisticle stays true to the classic formula with the classic 8-directional shooting we remember from the best of arcade classics while adding its own brand of modern flashiness through crisp and highly stylised pixel art provided by the ever talented Tikipod of Aqua Kitty fame. The game spices up the basic high-score arena shooting gameplay with a few elements of randomization and persistence giving roguelike depth to a generally simple arcade concept.\n\nThe dungeons are laid out in a grid starting you in one corner and the boss in the other, with layouts being randomized each playthrough. Defeating any given room leaves you faced with the decision of which direction to travel in, taking into consideration upgrades and powerups needed along the way to properly defeat the bullet-hell action of each of the four floor bosses. Different routes will provide you with either a shop for upgrades or a platforming minigame for earning coins, and sufficently powering up your character along the way is vital before facing any of the floors bosses.\n\nEven though the game stays mostly true to the shoot-'em-up roots of SMASH T.V. it includes the addictive properties of an RPG or roguelike. You also occasionally come across permanent upgrades that carry over on consecutive playthroughs, which raise any particular stat and is where the persistence comes from. These are very valuable, making future trips into the dungeon much more manageable and high scores more obtainable for diligent explorers who are keen to find and collect a good amount of upgrades.\n\nAside from the stat modifying upgrades you find are weapons you can gain from leveling up, and the selection is impressive. From walls of throwing daggers, streams of blue flamethrowers, to rows of area effecting bombs, there's plenty reason to keep playing and discover all of the devastating ways you can end your foes and rush through the levels even faster than before. Despite having beat the game, I still find new tools to play around with on each playthrough that make me re-evaluate how I could tackle it again.\n\nIron Fisticle is retro done right and a dream come true for score chasers. The adrenaline gives you an arcade high as you make a mad dash around each map collecting the pixelated food that drops to keep your multiplier going and test your skill against the world on the leaderboards. Even though a single playthrough can be experienced in one sitting, its the kind of game you'll want to visit everyday just to see how much better you can do the same way many of us revisit our favorite arcade classics.\n\nWith a solid brand of arcadey twin-stick chaos chock-full of addictive RPG properties that push you towards multiple playthroughs, excellent couch co-op, a heavy and groovy chiptune soundtrack complimenting crisp and attractive pixel art visuals all rolled into one package Iron Fisticle is one nostalgic experience that should not be passed up.","September 20, 2014","true","7.6"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","47","54","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tickmanfan/recommended/306700/","tickmanfan","thetick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tickmanfan/","489 products in account","This a fun little filler of game that takes place in dungeon with connecting rooms.  Your job is simply to kill all the mobs in the room and then grab the key to exit to another room.  You keep doing this until you reach the boss, which, after beating, will grant you access to the next floor.  There are four floors in this game, and runs can take you anywhere from a few minutes to a half hour, so it's great to pick up and play when you want something quick and light.\n\nThere are bonus levels and shops along the way to upgrade your stats such as speed, damage, rate of fire, health, and other goodies.  If you save your money, you can buy permanent stats that will help you with future runs, which is nice since you lose everything when you die.  The neat thing is you find yourself progressing fast enough, so you don't feel like it's a long grind.\n\nOverall this is a simple game with decent replayability and just enough depth to make it enjoyable.  It's perfect for me because I like to play a few quick rounds and then come back later.  I certainly recommended this game.","October 20, 2015","true","21.4"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

You play through different rooms across a map and can pick up power ups to defeat the different monsters. At the end of each of the levels you fight a boss. You will level up as you play more allowing you to develop your skills and get more powerful and varied items throughout the game randomly dropped from chests. If you save up you can also get a permanent gold upgrade (definately worth doing). There are also side scrolling bonus platform levels to get additional coins, a nice addition. Currently I have finished the first two levels but keep going back through from the first so I can get more gold upgrades and a better overall score. You can play local co-op but I quite enjoy this single player. I assume the game will be fairly short as after nearly 3 hours I have reached the last level, but I will take my time with it farming upgrades.

But whereas that game is a fast paced quarter-eater, here the pace is slower and more strategic, as well as featuring RPG-like elements such as equipment upgrades, shops and item collection. So perhaps it's more like The Binding of Isaac.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/306700/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","As many of the other reviews have stated, Iron Fisticle is similar to classic arcade games such as Robotron and Smash TV.\n\nThis is a twin-stick shooter.\nYou go in a room.\nYou kill everything.\nYou move onto the next.\n\nIn a number of ways, this game is designed to follow Smash TV's template. Your throwing axe isn't particularly good, so you have to take every chance to get hold of the good (but temporary) weapons. This changes things from merely being about slaughter to carving a path to the next weapon, all just to capture those precious seconds of relative safety. In terms of aesthetics and mechanics, Iron Fisticle is quite appealing. The graphics are nice and clean, resembling something from the Toaplan age. The controls are perfectly solid, and the hit-box is suitable for what needs to be done. This makes for an easy game to just pick up, play, and enjoy.\n\nThis game certainly isn't as difficult as Smash TV. As the store description goes, you can level-up to boost your health, abilities, and unlock new & items and weapons. Unlike seemingly every other rogue-like on Steam, these level-ups are permanent. You're free to purchase stat upgrades, so you'll start the next game with a nice boost. HP-restoring hearts are very prevalent as well. If you're particularly adept at the platforming bonus rounds, you can grab a full-healing before your next stage. Is it all really necessary? Yes and no.\n\nIn standard rogue-like fashion, merely beating the game isn't enough. Sure you might have defeated some great evil and saved the legendary turnip or radish or whatever the hell it is. However, when you've accomplished your task, you get kicked back to the beginning. Everything is a little more difficult now, and your luck will run out eventually. Now here's where things get interesting. Aside from Smash TV, Iron Fisticle also takes ideas from Bubble Bobble.\n\nWithin each stage, you'll find the silver weapon-holding chests, but you'll also collect a myriad of items that award points. Zombies drop food, which can award up to 800 points each. There are also special items, that are found in gold chests (one per stage). Sometimes the right special item can make a huge difference, and so can finding the right weapons. This adds a slight luck factor to the whole affair. Your dodging skills might be adept, but weapons are what keep you from getting cornered and overwhelmed. There is a dash move, which is pretty useful. However, zombies eventually roll extremely deep, and you could end up dashing into a crowd.\n\nSo for most players, beating the game isn't much trouble, but going for those pesky leaderboard spots will cause headaches. Theoretically you could beat the game an innumerable amount of times without dying, but you're always one streak of bad luck away from death. If you want the top score, you'll have to play for a several hours straight. This can get pretty dull, since you'll be so strong the first 30 minutes or so won't pose any threat. Last I checked, the top-score was around 8 million, that's at least 8 play-throughs in a row. Mercifully, the challenge mode is only four stages, though luck still plays a slight factor due to food-drops and other potential bonus points (and using spare iron fists to milk the "hurry-up" golems). There's also playing for the shortest time, which has some merit as well.\n\nWhatever the case, Iron Fisticle's long-term replay value isn't very high. Once you hit max level (which doesn't take very long) there aren't many incentives to play the game. The normal mode takes too long to become interesting, and there's a little too much randomness to make playing for score very compelling in the challenge mode. Even with that in mind, I still give this game a recommendation. It is fun, well-constructed, and does an admirable job of blending the design philosophies of multiple classic arcade games.","September 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mwhym/recommended/306700/","mwhym","mwhym","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mwhym/","802 products in account","I approached this game with caution. It sure looked like a variant of the original gauntlet (one of my favorite games of old) and I didn't want to be disappointed (as I was with the recent Gauntlet remake).\n\nAt a first glance the pixel graphics, resemble the original much more than its name sake, however the similarities don't end there as in many ways it does resemble it. Is it a worthy successor ? well I am not sure about that, its a nice try and I must say that with a little bit more work it could have been  truly great. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful game and one that offers lots and lots of fun, but unfortunately it is a bit shallow. Each battle takes place in a single room stage, so there is no exploring with a horde of monsters on your heels and the variation of weapons and specials is a bit limited, especially after a few runs.\n\nBoss fights are generally easy and you get the hang of each (of the few bosses - I think its four or five of them only) pretty easily.\n\nThere is a leveling system, accompanied by a skill set, which (especially in the beginning) is a nice novelty, but you go through it pretty quickly and actually will forget about it (for the most part) as you play more and more. You keep your level (along with certain skills you have bought) from one game to another, but there are also temp skills you acquire for each play-through only.\n\nOne very nice touch, is the global (score) ranking, so you can try to climb that ladder. Be warned though, to get to the upper levels of the rankings you will need to spend quite a bit of time and (for me at least) the game seems more geared towards casual and occasional play-throughs.\n\nThe control scheme is a bit complicated and i would not recommend it without a controller (twin stick is the best way to play it in my opinion). The game is generally undemanding in terms of specs and it run perfectly on my crappy laptop (even when I had forgotten to clean its vents causing it to overheat on almost every other game).\n\nThere is local coop also, but truth be told I did not get to try it, still it sounds like fun.\n\nWould I recommend it ? Yes, absolutely, its great fun, just don't expect something more than what it really is. I will be keeping it installed on my pc for sure as it is a great go to for some casual fun.","April 12","true","11.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/306700/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","308 products in account","Iron Fisticle is a twin-stick arcade shooter with procedurally generated dungeons. In this game, you play as an axe-throwing knight who's been whisked away through a portal by a monster who's stolen your castle's precious food. You have to fight through four levels with waves of monsters swarming around you. It's pretty awesome.\n\nAs with most arcade games, there is no save-functionality; every run is fresh and new. However, you can obtain permanent stat increases that persist between games. In this way, you can start each game with a slight advantage and build toward a strong loadout. Also, as your score increases, you level up, unlocking more items and raising your max stats. Along the way, you can grab temporary weapons which add variety to your attacks and items that help you survive, like armor and magic trinkets.\n\nThe difficulty scales quite well, with 3 different levels to choose from, as well as a challenge option. At first, swarms will steadily increase in size. As you progress, monster types will change and give you more of a challenge. The amount of different enemies to fight keeps the game fun and engaging. Bosses are fun to fight, and you'll need to raise your stats efficiently to handle the ever-mounting danger. I feel that the game is best played with a gamepad; you'll get more control out of it.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, however. I've experienced some periods of lag that occur at times they shouldn't, especially when there aren't even that many enemies onscreen. Players might get turned off by Iron Fisticle's retro aesthetic. I don't see anything wrong with a chiptune soundtrack and pixel graphics, but I do know a lot of players absolutely hate it, so it is something to consider. Feelings about the replayability of the game can be mixed; it's really fun to pick up and play for a while, but once you've beaten everything, you might find the gameplay to be quite stale.\n\nStill, the game makes for a really enjoyable experience, especially if you have a friend around. The $9.00 price-tag might be a little steep to some for the game's content, but it's a game that can give hours of entertainment. It's fun, addicting, and it makes for really relaxing playing. If you see it on sale, I would say you should definitely grab it.\n\nTL; DR: For fans of Gauntlet, Smash TV, and Robotron.","May 18, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Great smooth responsive gameplay, great sound and music, and fantastic art direction. The enemies, weapons, and effects are all very well done and the game has great lighting. The graphics are fantastic. They are new-age retro rather than pure retro which is good because we do not want to see games nowadays with straight up NES graphics. Shooting thousands of Frankenstein monsters in the face never gets old. A lot of people are describing this as a twin stick shooter although there is no shooting involved. There is not a constant stream of projectiles anyway, although a couple weapons do fire very rapidly. It is more like a twin stick axe thrower. The weapons are all great, although I don't much care for the random spread of the ninja stars and I don't like the canon balls. Their hit box is too small compared to the normal axe but the aoe is cool. The upgrade system is great and is the only way you will be able to progress in the game and eventually beat it. Save your coins as much as you can so you can afford permanent upgrades. I try to not spend coins on temporary upgrades unless I am in a pinch or have extra coin. The game gets hard around floor 3 then harder on floor 4, but not for any other reason than the game starts flooding the screen with enemies and when you can't move a millimeter without touching an enemy, you are gonna be in trouble.\n\nGame is worth every penny. I absolutely love it. 9/10\n\nPS- Just finished game. It is very short. I have 5.8 hours played but at one point I did leave the game running while I cooked and cleaned for nearly two hours so I beat this in roughly 4 hours, maybe 4 and 1/2.

A twin-stick shooter with solid controls (with a pad), and tons of varied and interesting enemies, it has proven quite addictive. There's a real sense of progression here, on no less than 4 fronts: your get better at the actual twitch gameplay, you can buy and pick up game-specific boosts as you progress, you can purchase permanent power-ups that improve your character permanently for each new game; and best of all, once you clear a floor's boss you can start the next game from the next floor down. This all combines to deliver a real sense of achievement, and adds to replayability. I'm not sure whether I will still think that once I complete the game, as right now I haven't - it is pretty hard. I am also not that fond of the boss fights which can descend into bullet-hell shoot-em-up territory, but otherwise this game is great.\n\nAvoid if you do not have a controller though, kb control is unsatisfactory!!\n\nEDIT: The game now resets after you kill the final boss and you now loop it at a higher difficulty.

But its just that : decent. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it doesn't improve on it either.\n\nYou shoot the same zombies over and over and over. Mages appear a little later that shoot bullets, but it gets so crowded that you might not survive to where there is more enemy variety. I picked it up to play some casual co-op with a friend, so I didn't intend to practice to get far. So we didn't.\n\nThe game lacks a certain punch to it. Know that sound and feel when you get a hit in Super Smash Bros, esp. on the N64? Yeah, there isn't that here. You just, somehow, throw AXES at a machine-gun pace and it does a barely-audible *tick*. Game feel is very important.\n\nThere is a lack of classes - there is only one. A thing I really enjoyed in the new Gauntlet remake was that one player could use the Valkyrie and shield your archer or mage teammate. Then the mage can slow enemies down so that they can be easier to handle melee. We would call when we'd prepare a move before the enemies spawned. That was really cool teamwork dynamic. None of that here.\n\nItems are for the most part useless. You get a staggering amount of drops from enemies, which then gets annoying since it does nothing but give you points. This is 2016, I'm playing in my living room not in an arcade gallery. Nobody is gonna look over and say OMG YOU GOT SO MANY POINTS!\n\nI know that it tries to recreate that style of arcady old-school game, but even then points never got in the way of the gameplay. You would kill enemies and get points automatically. But in this game you get drops that seem useful (to level up, for instance?), but only serve to distract from the enemies and give no gameplay benefit.\n\nOh! Is that a book? Awesome! I must get some kind of cool spell ability! *grabs book* 100 POINTS! *gets killed by projectile while distracted*\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, it is also okay but nothing to write home about. Cute pixel-art. Music is forgettable (see Shovel Knight). Sound lacks punch. Level design is square and bare. Average.\n\nIN CONCLUSION : a game that falls short of expections and becomes quickly boring despite the potential and attractiveness of the trailer.\n\nScore : 6.5/10\n\nRECOMMENDATION : Get on sale if you have a buddy that likes mob swarm twin-stick shooters to play Co-Op. Challenge yourselves to work as a team and crank up the sound to make things a bit more interesting.","February 24","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a game where you shoot stuff, get loot to increase your score, get weapons so you can slaughter more enemies and powerups to temporarily improve your chances of living.\n\nDiffering from SMASH TV is stats.  The stats can range from your life, your speed, rate of fire, and the rate your weapons diminish.  Also there are stores and the minigame.  The store, like any other store, requires cash to purchase stuff.  The cash can be found in pots, treasure chests, or through the minigame.\n\nThe graphics are impressive.  There is even a scanline option for those who are looking for a more "vintage" look.\n\nThe audio is fantastic as well.  Considering it is the gameplay and the music combined that just gave me the desire to buy this game.\n\nFor the price on this game I would wholeheartedly recommend this game.","September 5, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Mix 2 shots twinstick arena shooter with a one shot rogue-lite, add a dash of RPG and thoroughly muddle until murky and mediocre.\n\nIt’s passable at everything it does, but it does it all with a resounding lack of flair. Yes, the screen is awash with enemies, but the enemies are dull and uninspired, and often don’t present any interesting problem - simply kiting around the edge of the screen and firing inwards will get you through most rooms. Deaths are often the result  of sloppiness borne out of boredom, rather than the game throwing you a curveball.\n\nThen there’s the RPG elements. These should make the game more fun, but in fact, make it less fun. You can purchase permanent power-ups for all subsequent runs, and the upshot of this is that it makes a game of Iron Fisticle (a) last longer and (b) be even more tedious for the first level, as you’re now overpowered for it. That’s right, upgrades make the game *less enjoyable*.\n\nThat said, there’s a spot in everyone’s game library for something like Iron Fisticle, that game to play when you’re too tired and/or drunk to be bothered to play anything enjoyable, challenging or rewarding, and you just want something to do with your thumbs while you turn your brain off.\n","October 7, 2015","false","4.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game does share in common two traits of that game: the stages are static full-screen rooms and enemies spawn in fixed quantities at random positions throughout the arena. What it doesn't share is its high pace and intensity. The default weapon has both very low firing speed and range, which makes clearing rooms a chore more than anything else, and the player is expected to upgrade them through grinding. Player reviews also commonly compare Iron Fisticle to Smash TV, an all-time favorite of mine. And while the two games are closer in graphical style, enemy behavior and co-op features, the gap in pacing is far more apparent. In a market where there are at least two other games that play similarly that give the player much more power from the start without slowly doling out more, Iron Fisticle can be recommended only for the very patient and those somehow amused by the double entendre in its title, which isn't played up much in the game proper.","December 28, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Skeptical of cheap games I expected the game to be filled with bugs, more crashes than a stock car race and really bad game play. I was genuinely surprised at how well thought out this game is.\n\nIron Fisticle is a Dungeon crawling shooter game where you battle through 4 Levels (which aren't easy). This game has a level of difficulty to it and provides a nice leveling up system with permanent and temporary character upgrades. One of they games where you can actually notice an improvement in your character, and player skill - which is very rewarding.\n\nHowever, my cons are is that once you become an highly ranked character is that the game could become easy as there is only 4 levels (which is the ultimate outcome if you grind games). There is another mode, which at the current time I haven't dived into. The mode is basically the same as the normal mode, but you do not gain permanent upgrades - so Binding of Isaac.\n\nConclusion: for how cheap the game is, it's perfect. I believe all the other reviews are positive. If I was the developer of a relatively (review based) successful game I would be pushing as much content out the door as possible! This game exceeds the warrant to release DLC or sequel.","February 5","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lostmymind/recommended/306700/","lostmymind","deej","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lostmymind/","104 products in account","Iron Fisticle, got this game for insanely cheap via coupons and has blown me away. Skeptical of cheap games I expected the game to be filled with bugs, more crashes than a stock car race and really bad game play. I was genuinely surprised at how well thought out this game is.\n\nIron Fisticle is a Dungeon crawling shooter game where you battle through 4 Levels (which aren't easy). This game has a level of difficulty to it and provides a nice leveling up system with permanent and temporary character upgrades. One of they games where you can actually notice an improvement in your character, and player skill - which is very rewarding.\n\nHowever, my cons are is that once you become an highly ranked character is that the game could become easy as there is only 4 levels (which is the ultimate outcome if you grind games). There is another mode, which at the current time I haven't dived into. The mode is basically the same as the normal mode, but you do not gain permanent upgrades - so Binding of Isaac.\n\nConclusion: for how cheap the game is, it's perfect. I believe all the other reviews are positive. If I was the developer of a relatively (review based) successful game I would be pushing as much content out the door as possible! This game exceeds the warrant to release DLC or sequel.","February 5","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a small map with a boss objective, and you have limited choise in the path you take toward it. Unlike Smash TV, you can level up stats to help you do so.\n\nSome in-game items will take stats up for that play only, and you can also max your base stats out to about 50 percent of its upper max for starting out. That gives you some incentive for playing at first, and you can tell the difference when speed, attack power, attack speed, and more goes up.\n\nIt has about 4 levels of play, and completing that starts it over, with the enemies getting faster. You end up pathing a lot on most levels, and I like the puzzle-like feeling of cutting my way through dozens of oncoming enemies.\n\n","January 16","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
