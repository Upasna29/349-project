Its not everyone's cup of tea.  And on top of that, its severely buggy and largely unpolished.  But if you look past all that roughness, there is a true gem in here.  Not many games deliver so well on so much.  It may be one of the best PC games I've ever played.  Consider the following story as a testament to what kind of game this is:\n\nI started out an innkeeper in a large city in a large region.  I was doing okay.  I kept selling cheap food and drink in order to open a bakery nearby.  The bakery was also not much, mostly baking rolls for the masses.  But in time I was doing well financially and took some time off to pursue a love interest.\n\nThe same year she was pregnant and gave birth to my first born son.  I was busy working and she spent less time at the bakery.  Soon all her time was spent between the house and the church.  Neither of us minded though.  My son was of school age and we couldn't afford much.  So we sent him to a guild school to study to join the family business.  The same year, my wife was pregnant again, but this time with a little girl.\n\nDuring this time I was able to afford to be a citizen and was granted the ability to expand my business.  I quickly set up an orchard and a farm outside the gates.  It was hopeful, as the supplies for both the Inn and Bakery were now completely controlled by me.\n\nBy the time my daughter was of school age, we had the assets to send her to the best school possible.  My first born son, was not the most amitious child and my first born daughter had a brighter future due to our new financial situation.\n\nI had another daughter, and another son.  More of the same, I suppose, as I was too busy working at the largely successful Inn and expanding my business to fisheries and livestock.\n\nMy first born son was a disappointment.  He was born when we were poor and didn't amount to much.  He mostly went to church with his mother and didn't have the skills to follow in the family business.  My first born daughter on the other hand, had the right schooling and was perfectly set up to join the family business.  My second daughter, while successful on her own terms, didn't match the success of the first daughter.  And lastly, my last born child, a boy, was quiet and simply enjoyed school.\n\nWhen my first born daughter came of age to help out, she did with much ambition.  While I worked the Inn, she helped with apple picking and livestock.  She was maybe a bit too ambitious as she managed the workers with the attitude of a tyrant.  But I was happy with the success of my business and I was running out of room to expand, so I turned to politics.\n\nI managed to win a low level office for a very short time before getting replaced by a man who had leprosy.  However, my daughter almost entirely transitioned my business empire away from me and was doing quite well.  So I kept at it.  I had money to spend, so I intended to use it.  I began bribing people for votes, and I managed to bribe the king himself.  But, I lost again.\n\nWhile my daughter ran my business, and I was unsuccessful at politics, I had little to do.  So for the most part, I rekindled my relationship with my aging wife.  Also, my character strangely had alcohol in his inventory often, and was no stranger to drinking it on the spot or offering it to others.  On a strange night, I also tried sabotaging a rival bakery by tossing an explosive in the front door.  It was a mistake and didn't do much.\n\nWhile I declined from power and my daughter took over, I failed to notice my last born son.  He graduated from university with a doctorate.  He was a scholar and was a full grown man ready to open his own line of business.  Upon his graduation, he quickly started a bank and hospital in town.  He worked hard, but being the business man in the family, I saw issues.  Two doors down from his bank was a rival bank.  Around the corner from his hospital, was a rival hospital.\n\nHe was happy working and keeping to himself, so I took it upon myself.  We bombed them and ran.  I went home to my wife and all was fine.  Except, it wasn't.\n\nWhile I was at home with my wife, my son was working late at the hospital, and my daughter was working late night at the Inn, my daughter, unfortunately lead by her father's poor example, carried out a constant barrage of attacks across the entire city for hours.  Many people died, including many of my loyal bodyguards, and several buildings were so heavily damaged they couldn't be entered for fear of collapse.\n\nThe tooltip read for me - Corrupt.  My entire life I was a righteous man and in a single day I ruined a lifetime of good.  My daughter however, was labeled a walking nightmare.  A title she wore proudly as she was a violent and cruel woman.\n\nA day later I was summoned to trial for my crimes.  And shortly after, so was my daughter.  Fortunately for me, the persecuter was bad at her job and couldn't articulate my crimes well enough.  With experience, I was able to convince the judges that I was not guilty.  My daughter - the judge didn't even show and she walked free.\n\nI was done, however.  And now my entire business was in the hand's of my daughter and son.\n\nA few short years later my daughter married and had a series of daughters.  My son married and had sons.  She spent most of her time in the Inn, acting as an innocent server as she masterminded violence.  Her first born daughter stayed at home with her father, picking up the skills for crafting.\n\nMy son on the other hand built up impressive charismatic skills and began spending most of his time preaching.  He opened his own Catholic church and was busy speaking to the masses.  He wasn't as interested in the hospital anymore due to issues obtaining supplies needed for medicine.  That was, however, one of the catalysts for what happened next.\n\nIllness spread across the city.  It struck the elderly for the most part.  And the political stage was swept clean.\n\nMy son saw this as an opportunity to win an easy election and do some good for the city.  So he applied for a entry level political office.\n\nMy first born daughter's daughter was also of age and opened up a tailoring shop.  She worked in it night and day and was militant, like her evil mother.  However, she just enjoyed working hard.  She committed no crimes and often gave bonuses to her employees to reward them for putting up with her management style.\n\nMy son had only one opponent to beat for political office.  But to help seal the deal, his sister showed up and gave some bribe money to the king.  He won the vote and was now holding political office.  First it was the Leasing Officer.  Then it was the Guild Master.  Then Bishop.  Then he used his political power to help his sister and neice also win politcal offices.\n\nHe had charisma and the power of the people behind him.  His sister was a brute with deep pockets.  She kept helping him win and in return, he would give her his vote when she applied.  Together, they made it to the top - Cardinal, Soverign, and my grandaughter was Consul.  Together, they took down bandits, banished rivals, carried out crime and government authority hand in hand.  All while I watched from my estate.  My children took over the city both economically and politcally.  All while in my lifetime.  Not sure if I'm proud or scared.\n\nIf you made it this far, kudos for reading.\n\n","October 8, 2015","true","36.9"," 749 of 768 people (98%) found this review helpful 263 people found this review funny","98","749","768","263","14"

Having said that, it is still a big improvement over the last vanilla version, and I can also recommend either Fajeth or McCoy's mods to make the game even more playable.  Both do different things, but both are fantastic.  It is my recommendation that you try both (separately - mods generally can't work together in TG2) and definitely use one of them, especially once you've played vanilla for 50 hours or so to get a grasp for the basics of the game.\n\nOnto the review: I will not belabor the point: The Guild is my favorite game.  In this review I’ll try to explain why this is, and where I’m coming from in terms of my interest in the game, and probably games generally speaking.  Hopefully this will help introduce like-minded gamers to The Guild and perhaps also steer some people, if they have different tastes, from the game.\n\nI have always enjoyed simulation games, particularly economic and life sims.  I grew up playing what now seem like fairly simplistic sims (e.g., Theme Park, The Settlers, and The Sims) and was fascinated by the seemingly living world of the AI inhabitants in these games.  As I began to enjoy role playing games more, and in particularly Ultima Online, I longed for a simulation game in which I wasn’t in complete control, but instead could actually be one of those small inhabitants in the simulated world.  Nothing like this existed until I played the first Guild game (Europa 1400) and I was immediately won over, realizing that it was as close to a perfect game as I would ever find, short of developing one myself.\n\nThe Guild is indeed a simulated world.  It doesn’t attempt to be huge like Skyrim.  You are controlling a small family in a single town or on some maps a single town out of up to four.  There are up to eleven other “dynasties” (i.e. families) living in these towns, and they all go about their business without your intervention.  You are not god in this game – you are just a family existing and striving in the middle ages, and it is amazing fun.  It seems there is not one area that The Guild has left out of its gameplay.  You can get involved in politics, your character has a religiosity meter, favor (or disfavor) with every single sim in the game, a disposition based on their criminality or lack thereof, skills, perks (think fallout), marriage, children, trials, duals, and the list goes on.\n\nThe world in The Guild feels more alive than any game I have played.  NPCs go about their business with a real purpose, and it is all simulated.  They will do everything from sit around town and chat, go to the pub, hire a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, to run for office and command the city guard (who, by the way, are also governed by some degree of AI logic).  In short, the game feels a lot like living in a real, functioning medieval town.\n\nIn summary, if you’ve always enjoyed god games, economic sims, and life sims, but wanted to be part of the world rather than the controller of the world – wanted to have to work within the confines of human ability to influence the world (e.g., become mayor and change the law instead of using a hand in the sky to smite someone) then this is the game for you.  If you want complete control over the world and all of its inhabitants then you might not enjoy this as much, but I still say it’s worth a try.","December 21, 2013","true","201.3"," 192 of 195 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","192","195","0","0"

Whomever these guys are that bought this license are serious about cleaning it up, but the thing is it was already a great title to begin with. Yeah there were some translation problems, and ai issues, and general problems like that, but it wasn't terrible.\n\nAnyways, this game is just great. You play some male or female person set in old timey overseas land (you get to choose the map to play on), and try to stary a dynasty. You find a spouse, make some kids, and play through the generations. Jobs include stuff from politics, farming, to robbing people. You can make buildings like inns, pubs, churches, and so on or eleminate competing dynasties and take over their buildings through violence or cash. You can select your own stats on the dude or chick you're creating and level up skills through actions, so some rpg elements exist.\n\nYou got some trading elements in here as well. Own a mine? Send a caravan of ore to the neighboring village to sell, or import the stuff to make your own jewelry factory. Or make armor and weapons and attack villagers with your bandits. You got a lot of options here on what to do as far as playstyle is concerned. It's a sandbox, but you can't just plop buildings down everywhere. Still there's a lot of options to be found and fun to be had by picking this up and giving it a shot. It can be a little daunting to get into, but I ended up having a lot of fun with this and The Guild II. Well mainly vanilla Guild II, but this is just that with more stuff, so if you can decide which version to get, this is the one to grab.","December 22, 2014","true","6.2"," 131 of 135 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","131","135","7","1"

Because of this, I will here review the base game along with the expansion in one review.\n\nThe game is a economic strategy and production manager game, taking place in Europe the 1400s. Your goal is to build a family, a dynasty and an economic empire from scratch, starting with just a small cottage and enough money to build or buy your first little workplace, and hiring some workers. You can choose which direction you want to expand through, be it food production like farms or bakeries, "Entertainment" industries like churches and pubs, or maybe something seedier, like robber dens, thieves guilds or money lenders. You can even try your hand at politics! The game has a surprising amount of variation if you actually play it for more than 10 minutes.\n\nThe game features beautiful music, as well as surprisingly good graphics for it's age and budget. There are however quite a few cons to this game:\n\nThere are so many bugs in this game, a few of them are even gamebreaking, others are just hilarious. Most of the bugs have luckily been fixed in community made patches, and there is even a small modding community who, now and then, create a few high quality mods.\n\nThe netcode is also atrocious, and i would suggest only playing multiplayer with friends who are patient and understanding of such problems. It isn't that much of a problem though, as i would say you'll have most of your fun in singleplayer anyway.\n\nThe Guild 2 is, despite its many, many faults, one of my favourite games of all time, and i truly recommend it to anyone who enjoy strategic economy games, like patrician or the "Tycoon" games. What sets this game apart from those games, is the important fact that you only control your family and your buildings, while everything and everyone else you can see are potential allies or rivals.","August 22, 2015","true","21.8"," 70 of 72 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","70","72","2","0"

What a seriously innovative and refreshing game design. This is a serious sandbox game. And I mean GAME. Sometimes sandbox games fall in the trap of having a lackluster or tacked on set of objectives. This game brilliantly balances a free-form open style with a true game-objective win/lose strategy. "Eliminate your competitors" - in near anyway you choose (before they eliminate you). Granted the lack of tutorial/psudo-random tip popups to help you figure your way though this almost overwhelmingly unique game play style is a rather large barrier to entry -  but once it all clicks in (See: YouTube), this game is fulfilling and addictive.\n\nBuy a fisherman dock, fishmonger your way to riches and aristocracy, marry a young local, wander the back alley alone on a cold winter night, get attacked and poisoned by a paid thug care-of your vilest of competitors, take on the role of your young son - a devious silver spooned rogue - and enact a bloody revenge on  the murder of your former fish monger self.

It has many quirks, bad performance, can crash a lot on some PC's, and multiplayer suffers from irrepairable out of sync errors that can trash a save (there have been some reports of being able to work around this, I have never bothered to try to fix these OOS errors.)\n\nBut by god, this game is oddly fun with friends.\n\nGet a good friend, a couple friends maybe, and host a game of The Glid Poo. If you don't take it too seriously and stick together you can have some of the grandest times ever. My adventures include building 2 banks right next to eachother, learn banking doesn't work and requiring 200 dollar payments from my friend for 2 hours while I went around trying to commit murder. Another time me and a friend amassed a small army of 40-50 guys and destroyed a bakery so I could build another foundry in its place. One of the best times was when my good buddy ended up building 3 fortresses so he could have a death squad to kill every person in the political ladder and become the mayor, and I piggybacked along to become immune to the law.\n\nTheres nothing quite like amassing a fortune by pick pocketing, building a ton of daggers and then hearing "YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED", presumably because you sent "Smellvios" to go try and beat up a guard, only to be bailed out because your friend sent 20 mercenaries and thieves after the accusor and then blew up his house. Whether you're monopolizing the skull candle market or seeing if you can take on a peasant out in the countryside, this game provides an unexplainably entertaining experience when you play with a good friend. The absurd stuff that you can do, or that can just happen on its own on top of a fairly good economics tycoon sorta game (if pretty buggy) can result in very memorable adventures to lament on with a friend when you're both on your rocking chairs watching the sun go down 60 years down the line.\n\nGet it, get a friend, get some food and snacks and prepare for "sun up glid"","June 13, 2015","true","65.4"," 70 of 81 people (86%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","86","70","81","24","7"

How? Bugs. I am recommending this game now because it has, miraculously, been granted a new patch (which you have to set the game to beta to get through Steam, fyi) which I am hearing good things about.\n\nThe old bugs, which may still exist -- I'm not sure yet -- were as follows:\n#1 - Multiplayer NEVER worked. Even if you connected through Hamachi (the only way to get multiplayer to even connect) the game would desync after 20 ish minutes and your saves would be corrupted so you couldn't even reload and continue. This game is so amazing for multiplayer and this is just a big kick in the gaming nuts.\n\n#2 - There are a lot of smaller game breaking bugs...too numerous to mention. I can give some examples. One time, nobody ever seemed to progress in the political field. Sometimes your characters get jammed and won't move. Sometimes you save the game and it gets corrupted and you lose everything. Just weird things that should work just...don't...and it's hard to predict and once it happens you can't just 'reload' to get around it. That being said, I have played through games that were 8+ hours long before getting screwed by one of these bugs (provided you are playing in single player).\n\nBut this game is fantastic if these bugs are fixed.\n\nFor one, this game is a mish mash of a bunch of different games. In this game you control your 'family' starting with one guy. It's very RPGish in the sense that each of your family members can level up and apply points to various skills. You can make them better at combat, better at working, better at politicking, etc.\n\nYou can get married, have babies, and then once they grow up you can control them and expand your dynasty. The buildings you own get transfered down the generations so your hard work with your first guy isn't lost when he dies of old age (or disease, or murder, or getting thrown in jail forever).\n\nThere are different sized maps but generally a map consits of one to three cities of various size. Each city has their own town hall with their own political arena. You can get elected and then move up towards mayor -- each office you can be elected into has different special powers that can be used to improve your family, or hurt others that are in your way. For example, you can banish someone from a city, or throw them in jail, or cause them to lose one of their buildings, etc.\n\nThere is a court house and 'law' as well. If you witness someone comitting a crime you gain the ability to testify in court with evidence against them. If you don't like them, you can charge them with a crime and then try to beat them in court. While you can sway the courts with your political favours, the more evidence against you makes this harder so blatently breaking the law or fighting people in town is going to brand you an outlaw and probably killed by the guards or thrown in jail if you comply.\n\nThere are four major classes and as you marry and have kids you can train them into different classes so that EVENTUALLY you can access every type of building in the game -- but basically, your character(s) each get to be trained in one of the four classes. One is a kind of farmer, one is a scholar that can get hospitals and such, one is a blacksmith type character that can make weapons and tools, and one is a thief that can create thieves guilds and other buildings that set up traps to rob people transporting goods.\n\nThe game also has a free market and prices rise and fall depending on how much of what is being sold. In fact, if one item is sold a lot in one of the cities and not in the other, you can make money by transporting from one city to the other -- provided you have enough muscle to protect your cargo from any thieves setting up on the roads.\n\nYour houses can train guards which you can use as personal muscle, even to overpower actual city guards, or to plot assasination attempts on powerful members of opposing dynasties.\n\nThe controls can be a little confusing -- there's a lot of menus you have to learn to use to be able to quickly identify who is who in the city -- but it can all be done.\n\nWhen you do build up your financial empire, you typically want to build one of every building and supply your buildings with your own productions. You'll get a mine, and refine the ore for your blacksmith who will make the weapons to sell or use, etc.\n\nSome routes are a lot easier to start with than others. I recall that being a farmer won't make you rich, but it's pretty easy to make money with cows. Blacksmiths are very useful but they're hard to make enough money from early on.\n\nAnd I was never good with thieves, but they can be very powerful later on by preventing other players from trading and leaving all the profit to your dynasty only.\n\nThe game is very deep and for that reason you can get lost playing this game for days. In all honesty, if this game had fixed all of its bugs I would have ranked it one of the best games I've ever played.\n\nI am hopeful that this patch has fixed a lot of the bugs and if that's so, I'll probably leave this recommendation as positive. Otherwise, I'll probably remove it or make it negative. Stay tuned!\n\nThis is a fantastic sandbox game and really unique.","January 14, 2015","true","69.2"," 53 of 58 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","53","58","4","5"

What results is the same game you get with The Guild 2, only polished much further and with many new additions. If you visit the Rune Forge forums, you'll see that they are still releasing patches (as mods, silly enough) even though the publisher has ended dev support. The community is also still active, with new posts on the forums each day.\n\nI'm not trying to say that this game is the best thing ever, but it is definitely the only of it's kind. If you appreciate economics, history, sociology, politics, and the like, and you're looking for a somewhat casual strategy game, you should consider this game among the others on your list. If you're thinking of this as a medieval sims-type game or that you will be able to jump right in and start playing, you're going to be disappointed. This is a thinking man's game, and gamers who aren't willing to put up with bugs and take the required hours needed to fully understand the game will be wasting their money. I'm not saying only serious master-race strategy gamers can appreciate this game, or that people who don't like complicated games have bad taste or are dumb; I just think that the way the game is marketed makes it appear to be much more simple than it really is, and that results in a lot of bad reviews that shouldn't have been reviews to begin with.","December 11, 2013","true","4.0"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","2"

I'll start off with the problems with the game: The game tends to run poorly and you will not be getting the FPS you might expect, there is a LOT of bugs that was not addressed in offical patches, and it is a very difficult game to just pick up and play. There is no "instant" action like you might desire, as the game takes awhile to get going. The pros however are a deeply complex system that allows you to run for offices (Dungeon master, mayor, bishop, etc) and each of those offices have fun little perks. Are you the dungeon master and someone is running for your office? Off to the dungeon for a "talk"...aww, he didn't make it to the council meeting? Guess you win by default! A lot of the bugs can be addressed with the fan patch 4.17B (as of this writing) and there is a ton of other fan patches that address several of the games fault.

According to all I've heard. Renaissance is the most complete and patched version of The Guild 2 and it's all you need. It's also recommended you find the latest UNofficial patch, since Steam only has up to version 4.15 which is years old. Apparently the people who made the game weren't allowed to officially fix the thing after awhile. Jowood kind of sucks for support eh?\n\nAs for the game itself ... I've put about 31 hours into playing this game, and I'm not sure why. I really like the concept, but the design and implementation is mostly just baffling. It sits somewhere between economic simulators like Dawn of Discovery / ANNO 1400, and personal management sims like The Sims. However I don't think it's a good game in either sense; it needs vastly more depth on either the economy-sim side, the war-sim side, or the Sim-side, and as this is a complete game with no mod-support to speak of, that depth is never going to happen.\n\nMy experience with it is started out just being unintuitive, but I stuck with it. Tens of hours later, now that I know how the game works and am able to pretty much 'win' at it, I just don't LIKE it.

You use your funds to build a number of production facilities - everything from your basic farm to buildings producing high end equipment, armor and artifacts for trade or use. In addition to a typical strategic "god view" you control 3 individual characters. You can engage in a variety of activities with these characters like having them run for office, enage in special actions with the buildings they own like goading the workers into action, and so forth.\n\nThe game starts off amazingly. It's great fun when you first start out and you can effectively micromanage all of your production facilities. Unfortunately, the game begins to fall apart once you reach the point where micromanagement becomes impractical if not impossible. The game provides a number of ways to try to automate your buildings but they are extremely bare bones, and very buggy even given that.\n\nFor instance, imagine you would like to simply take a product that one facility produces and bring it over to another facility that uses it as a resource, like bringing grain to a mill to turn into flour. The game allows you to setup an "automatic trading route" to do exactly this, but what is offered provides marginal functionality and does not work as intended. You can't supply "up to" an amount or anything of the like. You can do nothing except constantly send goods with one of three choices in terms of frequency: "rarely, occasionally, constantly." What do these mean you ask? I have no idea, the game in no way tells you. The sparse 12 page manual dedicates two sentences to the topic:\n\n6.4 AUTOMATIC TRADING ROUTES You can now set automatic routes for your wagons. You can choose single waypoints for your routes and decide what to carry.\n\nAnd even once you do get a trade route setup your transport wagons will occasionally just completely stop working in random locations. It's not for lack of a quantity of resources, or lack of desire at their destination. It's just a bug. Setting the routes up is an arduous process that you'll find yourself doing over and over again for the same route.\n\nThe other method to deal with an inability to micromanage is to completely automate a facility. This is much more functional, however it is once again incredibly bare bones and restrictive. In particular there is no way to have your own facilities provide their resources to one another. Instead your resource providing factories will sell all of their production to the market. Assuming the transport wagons for your factories that need those resources can beat the AI to the market, they will then purchase them there, losing a substantial amount of money in the process. In a game that is entirely about money and resource management this is incredibly frustrating.\n\nThere are also numerous other bugs in the game related to most of every action. You and your betrothed set out on your lengthy journey to the chapel to happily get married. Three quarters of the way there she decides, "You know. I actually think I'm going to go engage in church services on the other side of the world first. Bye!" Or you'd like to bribe the mayor of your town. You send your character, who can run substantially faster than the mayor to do this. Your character will catch up to the mayor and then begin to slow down to engage in the bribe action. The mayor will ignore this and continue walking, your character will catch up and again slow down. The process will repeat indefinitely until the mayor decides to finally stop somewhere, often many hours later.\n\nIn general, I cannot recommend this game. It had great potential. I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of the game, but the middle and endgame completely fall off. However, the company behind the game has been updating this version, presumably due to the imminent release of the Guild 3. This review has been based upon Version 4.2 with the hot-fix applied.","April 1, 2015","false","118.2"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","40","57","0","1"

It is truly something quite unique.\n\nA fair warning early on in this review, though, is that the game is ridden with bugs that affect gameplay in a variety of ways and the game itself is no longer supported by its creator, meaning official patches will no longer be released and the patch community is devised of the player base, and that is it.\n\nDon't let that daunting news discourage you, though! There's a reason why I recommend this game in stead of calling it a flop not worthy of even having a price tag upon it.\n\nThere are two particular patches located within the series of tubes that patch from 4.10 to 4.15, and 4.15 to 4.17b (a beta patch well-worth getting), of which make the normally buggy and slightly aggravating game of The Guild II Renaissance something to flaunt when it rests in your game arsenal.\n\nIt fixes more than just a few bugs and adds some minor content that aids in making the currounding environment in-game more adaptive to your playstyle. Also, on another note, internet servers no longer exist to my knowledge and the game must be run through a LAN set-up if you wish to play multiplayer, for instance with Hamachi.\n\nYes yes, LAN can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ at times, but I have found that a multiplayer LAN session with friends I know all playing this game together is an event we have actually tried to plan doing once every week. It is that good.\n\nNow to game specifics. The Guild II Renaissance allows you to play as a few starting professions ranging from Scholar, Rogue, Patron and Craftsman. Your main character will play as this role and each role gives you a particular set of buildings you may construct to further build your little 'empire', or more-so your family legacy, and with each building comes two upgrades that subsequently get more expensive, but also carry better bonuses like more employee slots and upgraded security factors i.e. water buckets to put out fires faster if your building happens to catch fire, and iron bars to make a robbery take much more time to complete.\n\nAt the time of main character creation as well, you are given the opportunity to set some traits higher than others with a few extra trait points and to choose an astrological symbol that gives you a bonus in a particular trait that is associated with the symbol. You may also choose to be Catholic or Protestant, which can also be changes if your local church offers baptising in the 'opposite' religion.\n\nNow off the topic of your main character and on to the other little bits. As I mentioned earlier, you start off with your main character. One can not simply live forever, in theory, correct? Correct! Your character (male or female) must find a partner before his/her years start to come to an end! Together, yee' will conduct holy (or on-the-spot) matrimony and have highly censored sex until a baby pops out the following year. Marrying another character will put that character under your control and will further increase your 'man-power' in the ultimate climb to power. You are also given the opportunity to send your child to a couple schools, one being fairly expensive but also giving him/her more trait points to allocate once he/she becomes of age, and the cheaper one which offers stock trait point accrual.\n\nThere is so little time to explain all this game has to offer, but if the information I have given you so far doesn't pique your interest more than a little bit, this game is definitely not for you. If it does, however, I -HIGHLY- recommend purchasing it and letting your friends know about it as well! You can have up to 12 player and NPC factions active in one session, so ultimately, you can have 12 players playing at the same time! Of course, the more players you add, the stronger the connection will need to be, for the game can crash. Advice on this issue I can offer is to always save your game if you feel like you have made a noteworthy accomplishment.\n\n","February 17, 2014","true","40.5"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","3"

God bless.\n\nWelcome to The Guild II: Renaissance, a game developed by Rune Forge and published by Nordic Games in July 2010. The Guild II: Renaissance is one of, if not the best merchant simulators on the market. Don’t be fooled into thinking this is a review for The Guild II. No, no, no. This is a review for the vastly superior The Guild II: Renaissance. A game where you take the role of a single man (or woman), with only a dream and 2000 gold to start a dynasty that will either be remembered as a respected political family, or a dastardly crime syndicate. All while trying to battle through the technical glitches and game breaking bugs.\n\nIn The Guild II: Renaissance the aim of the game is quite difficult to explain. The main objective of each game is to wipe out enemy dynasties; however the game is a lot more complicated than that. You have many ways you can wipe out your enemy dynasties, either by death or by reducing their assets to nothing. The way in which this is completed depends on the character class you choose at the beginning of the game. Are you a horribly evil rogue that preys on delivery wagons in order to feed your desire for gold? Or are you a legitimate business owner, trying to make an honest living? Whatever class you decide to choose you won’t be disappointed with the range of content each class has to offer. I found that the easiest class to start out with was in fact the rogue. I could simply assign my gluttonous henchmen into patrol routes where they were automatically pillage any wagon carts that would dare pass my Bandit Lair. In doing this I avoided the micromanaging that The Guild II: Renaissance has to offer. When micromanaging in a Patron or Craftsman role you can use the games auto managing feature. Be warned; this function inside the game is painstakingly awful to use. You will often find businesses not producing anything at all, or buying too much ♥♥♥♥♥ and not putting it to good use. Causing you to lose the game if you’re not paying attention. But hey, did I mention you can marry folk’ and give birth to children that will take over your dynasty once you die?! This is without a doubt one of the best features in The Guild II: Renaissance and is how dynasties prolong their lifespan when your original character meets their eventual demise. Each character has their own levels and sets of skills. When you produce children they will inherit skills from both the mother and the father. This makes the games skills and levelling system actually have meaning and a useful purpose. Having such a rich and deep system in a trading simulation game is quiet the feat to have. Another absolutely great feature layered into The Guild II: Renaissance is the ability to climb the political ladder. Each rank in the political ladder comes with special commands that only a person with a certain political prestige can use. For example - the mayor can set the laws in a town while a guard captain has full control over units in the city. Nobody can be trusted in politics, to climb this political ladder you must bribe, assassinate and lie your way up the ranks in order to gain approval by higher ranked council members. Honestly, this is just a great system that I’ve never seen used in a game like this before.\n\nIn the midst of this great gameplay we stumble across the major problems that The Guild II: Renaissance has growing out of it’s almost too good to be true gameplay. To start this off, the game is a technical mess.  As mentioned before the automatic management of business will only work when it decides to, this alienates a large portion of players that may not want to mess around with the micro-managing, especially if you have 12 banks in 3 different cities. Not to mention this game is littered with game breaking bugs that will crash your game with no warning or notice at all, so you will be expected to save often. Dialogue cut scenes don’t add anything to the gameplay except be incredibly annoying due to the lack of a ‘SKIP CUTSCENE’ button. Often at times you will hear random sounds that just have no place in a cut scene however they just keep playing over, and over again. The multiplayer would have been great to play but it just doesn’t ♥♥♥♥ing work, which is a damn shame considering the potential it could have brought the genre.\n\nIn short The Guild II: Renaissance is a fun game to be had if you can look past its technical flaws and occasionally bad game design. The maps are great and diverse, and the stories that can be told in this game are endless. Design choices are questionable however the game breaking glitches and bugs are inexcusable. I will be looking forward for The Guild III which is set to be released sometime next year (2016) by Nordic Games. My hopes for the game are that it gives us everything The Guild II: Renaissance had but improves on the visual aspects, while keeping it updated and free from any technical atrocities that this this game suffered from.\n\n+ Innovative gameplay\n\n+Great dynasty system\n\n+Every play through is different\n\n-Lack of proper multiplayer\n\n-Game breaking glitches and bugs\n\n-Bad visuals and animations","April 3, 2014","true","19.9"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","0"

You can play as an out right criminal or try and be a legal businessman or women. You can play with all out force to elimanate your rivals or go a different route by building a economic power thru business and politics. But even then your rivals must be elimanated thru legal or illegal ways. Duels, false evidence or even real evidence and or bribes and blackmail. There are so many ways to play the game its hard not to find a gameplay that you like if you have decided to even look at these reviews.\n\nNow with that said. If you decide to play there are a few must haves. Base game from steam. 2 patches, one from steam 4.21 or 4.211. Get 4.21 via steam and 4.211 from   http://www.theguild3.info/filebase/file/27-the-guild-2-renaissance-patch/. I usually get both from that site. After that its highly suggested to go with either legacy or megamod. They are highly suggested to get rid of the bugs that occur with base game. If your not use to them its very easy and worth the few moments it takes to read on how to install. Even thou that the game was released in 2010 these 2 mods are being updated and even listen to and or add reasonable suggestions by us players.\n\nIf you are still on fence I would suggest to look at some videos on youtube. If still on the fence follow and wait for discount. If you feel the graphics are not to power of the current games, the possibilities far out weigh that. If I havent sold you on this game yet follow The Guild 3, Its currently being developed and from what I can see is farther along then many of the betas and early access games that I have tried or looked at. And they havent done that because they looking to release a solid game. And may be the game you are looking for.....\n\ncheers","April 25","true","394.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The games official genre is a 'historic economy simulation' but there are so many other things that can be done...\n\nBasically you pick a class (Patron, Scholar, Rogue or Craftsman), each class has its own line of goods it can produce - the twist being that most products rely on a good or component from another's class to complete its higher end goods (ex; Armorers need cow hides from Patrons to complete leather armor; Churches need lumber from woodcutters to produce their parchments).\n\nBut then there is another section of the game where you can rise in political power; its seat you hold has different perks (ex; Guild master can control finance; Head of church controls the tithe; Head of Law can set the severity of trial outcomes) each of these positions can be used for your own personal gain like sending people to the dungeon for a week's time which causes them to miss a court appearance where they might potentially get you convicted of a crime or making them miss an election where you can take their seat). You can also hire henchmen as security, to burn down your rivals' business...all sorts of wicked stuff.\n\nThis all comes at a price, which is time. Everything takes time, naturally. Crops take time to grow, then takes time to process crops (raw materials) into, say, wheat flour which would then be used to make bakery items, church items, etc. This brings into play the economy of supply and demand, where if you're smart and resourceful enough, you can corner the market for really large profits in any particular city. Then of course there are the rogues who rob, kindnap and plunder everyone, everywhere.\n\nIn short this is a very ambitious game that covers alot of different genres...successfully. The problem with this ambitious project is that it comes at the cost- the price being eye-candy. To say the graphics engine is dated is almost a compliment, but anyone who can appreciate all the stuff jammed into this game will (hopefully) understand that games that are really pretty to look at are really shallow in gameplay.\n\nThe game is awesome and very deep, but it's also not for everyone.\n\nTHE GOOD\n- Innovative blend of role-playing, real-time strategy, and economic-sim genres\n- lots of detail and a great medieval atmosphere\n\nTHE BAD\n- Repetitive gameplay\n- Really heavy on micromanagement\n- Limited character interaction","March 24","true","6.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

You can choose to begin as a humble farmer, a dashing rogue, a dedicated craftsman or a studious scholar. And that's just your day job! You can become involved in politics if you so choose and possibly, with enough effort invested, becoming a member of the ruling class.\n\nAll of the above, and more... if you have the patience and determination to learn how the game actually works. There is a tutorial provided, but it's unfortunately lacking in content. Weather it deliberately leaves out so much so we can discover fun little actions ourselves, I don't know, but you will spend a good hour learning how to actually play the game even after playing through the tutorial.\n\nI'd like to have had more character customization. Unlike 'The Sims Medieval' your individual avatar is quite limited in appearance. I can understand this considering your initial character is going to be among the first to die; leaving you with his offspring and offspring of their own to continue building your empire.\n\nWhen it comes to your dynasty, as it grows in size and scope, it becomes a micromanaging nightmare. There is an AI option for your businesses, but I find it to be less than satisfactory; which results in me having to run each and every establishment I own. It rapidly gets obnoxiously tedious.\n\nThere are still quite a few bugs present but none of them, in my experience, seem to be game breaking. They are, at worst, an annoyance.\n\nOverall there are a few things I would have like to have been different (character customization for one), but for the price this game is an absolute steal.\n","January 20, 2015","true","73.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This is particularly true with "Renaissance" as the latest and most comprehensive addition.\n\nAmbitious at the outset, what The Guild II Renassiance successfully accomplishes (with minor flaws) is a faithful recreation of medieval life and its jarring transition to early capitalism. Everything falls under the purview of this simulation -- politics, economics, family, and what I view as its most compelling aspect -- murder, intrigue, and the subsequent games one might play with a court system as an extension of the earlier mentioned politics.\n\nIt's a sociopath's kind of simulator. "The Guild II" has always, from my perspective, marketed itself on the player's ability to place the daughters of your character's enemies into prostitution, engineer methods of spreading plague to your rivals, and of course, its ability to rouse the jolly spirit of arson in everyone.\n\nHere is something that happened in one of my playthroughs. An AI owner of the town's hospital would not leave the building so that I could murder them and buy the deed to the place. My character had a high charisma and was able to fabricate a claim that the owner of the hospital had committed a serious crime and went to the court with said claim. From the AI's reluctance to leave the hospital, they failed to appear for the court summons and were deemed a persona non grata.\n\nThe AI still did not leave the hospital at this point, so I firebombed the facility. As the building was engulfed in flames, the AI owner immediately stormed out of the place and was quickly lynched in the streets by the townsfolk. I got my hospital and without murder.","January 28, 2015","true","46.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","9","10","3","0"

Out of Sync issues are more of a rarity, we can freely play with 5 friends quite easily and if an out of sync issue happens we just role back to the morning at 1:00am.

You can now make each round last 1 year and not worry about your main characters dying of old age. Ways to eliminate your competitors have been also improved. Since your workers and allies fight for you when you attack someone you can use brute force with more ease. Even losing a fight can work for you if you want to get rif of your allies.

By itself it might add a lot of new features but it was all stuff that was already available as mods.\n\nRenaissance adds new stuff in pretty much every category and with each new addition comes a new bug. Unfortunately this is a step down from the relatively polished nature of Pirates of the European Seas and a return to the bug ridden mess that was the original The Guild II.\n\nAs with some many games that keep releasing new games while changing very little I come to a strange conclusion. If you asked me to recommend you one of The Guild II games to buy I'd say to get Renaissance, it's the latest incarnation, it has the most features and most of the mods available are made for it now. Taking each of the 3 games by their own merits however, as if they existed by themselves, Renaissance is by far the poorest.","January 14, 2013","true","267.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is however one of a kind, there are very few games that feature sandbox mode business building in the 18th century. There is the element of starting up with your preferred business, finding a wife and starting a family - this is pretty much the gameplay of your first generation. As you build up more cash you can buy titles in order to buy more businesses, upgrade your house and also qualify for political offices. Some businesses are better suited to later generations - such as Carpenter, this business will be much more profitable if you also own a woodcutter hut which then can supply the wood needed and sell surplus to the markets (without this the need to buy wood from the expensive markets makes it quite not very profitable).\n\nAll level 1 businesses can be levelled up to levelled up (1 - 2 - 3) which offers further production options and perks that can aid production, add workers and even fend off burglars. You can even decide to go a little crazy and start killing people, you will be taken to court and be sent to prison, fined or even executed for this. There is so much you can do with this game.\n\nI've seen some reviews saying that it has a clunky interface (it probably does if you aren't used to the game) but most of these people seem unwilling to learn how to play the game, if you want a simple game then stick to candy crush. I will repeat it is not perfect, you will probably find many bugs but there isn't anything that makes it unplayable and it can be very entertaining if you let it!","June 25, 2015","true","153.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Mostly in multiplayer. I remember the old times with timeout issues. They are mostly gone, but there are till some bugs. I'm glad developers are still working on it. It even has a fairly big modding community. I've been playing it for a long time, got it in a computer magazine, and I've decided to support the developers once more, so I've bought it on steam. I realise that there were lot of different companies running The Guild since Europa 1400.\n\nThis game has a great potential. It's one of the most complex games, but yet it is easy to play, but difficult to master.\nIt's an economic simulator.\nAt the beginning you create your character, there are not many options in design, but this is not The Sims. The more important things are the stats and class. You can even chose between 2 religions, protestant and catholic, the only difference in my opinion is that you can only build church of your religion. You can change it in a church.\n\nSo to the classes: there are four of them: Patron, Craftsman, Rogue and Scholar.\nThey are not balanced. The devs and modders are trying to fix it, but it's still not it. I hope guild 3 will be better balanced.\nMy first try was Rogue (obviously). It was the easiest way to accumulate a lot of money, get rid of concurrence and hold the highest position in the council. In fact, in about 30 years, I've had a huge mansion on a hill and I stopped playing.\nThat's the biggest problem of the game. In singleplayer, it gets repetitive.\n\nScholar is second easier, maybe even easiest, because you don't break the law for your job. But you should. Where is the fun? :D\nYou just build a church and people pay you just to go in there. You can easily make friends and make everybody hate your enemies. I personally like the cemetery, because of all the satanists praying there. Even more than in church.\n\nCraftsman is my favorite, because it has a lot of challenge, mostly in big cities flooded with concurence. The job of a craftsman is to make something from something else. That's different from patron and scholar who just collects their materials, and rogue who steals it.\n\nI don't play for patron much, because I find it boring. So no review of that profession.\n\nEvery profession is necesarry in a town, maybe except of the rogue. Without patron, craftsman cannot produce clothes and so on, and scholar cannot make medicine or other stuff. It is probably the most frequent reason of dying or bankrupting. No scholar means no hospital, what almost certainly means death. I hate that AI does'n really have a stock of more expensive medicine.\n\nOverall AI isn't so Intelligent, but in recent updates and modpacks it is more agressive and more complex. I hope that it will be better in The Guild 3.\n\nSo I think that's enough for now, nobody is reading it anyway, I will maybe write another one regarding some other features, like marriage, children, burning down your neighbours house or kidnapping your mother in law.\n\nI'm really looking forward to The Guild 3, in fact, I would gladly do alpha/beta testing.","January 12","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

(Unless you're a rogue)\n\n++ Edit: Patch 4.20 was released 22nd December! Definitly improved the gameplay, and I recommend it even more than before!\n\n\nBottom-Line\nI would only and very much recommend this game to anyone who looks for an RTS that isn't trendy, there's quite few people I know which enjoyed this game. If your more into killing, return to C&C or SC. It lightly delivers an RPG feel, has a great economic system, and unique way of going about the game from a military point of view. Not only does it provide objective based rules, there is a sandbox to try out new things for single and multiplayer. However, you have to weigh bugs, your patience, and an absent multiplayer(online)  into playability of the game. The multiplayer does not work very well if you're playing with even 1 AI Dynasty, as it De-Syncs the other player most likely after 1 round (24 minutes normal speed). It's possible to counter with constant saving/loading, but for me It's not worth it.

I enjoyed building up my dynasty. I enjoyed attempting to climb the political ladder while preparing for a revolution. I enjoyed the satisfaction of advancing my station in society. But the game just seems unfinished with broken or strange mechanics, nonsense dialogue, and game breaking glitches.\n\nBuilding a dynasty is cool. You get married, you have kids. Simple. But having a flourishing dynasty is useless because you're only allowed to control three characters at a time, and if you stop controlling one at any time, they're gone for good. If you have a member halway up the political ladder and you need to control another member of your family so they can start having kids of their own, you're out of luck. You have to make a choice. Do most of my kids end up unmarried and childless, or do I abandon my political career for them?\n\nSome of the broken mechanics involved the game permanently being stuck on pause and reloading a previous save does nothing. Others are the strange way you manage your dynasty, down to the weirdest dialogue. I understand it's a sim, but when my wife and mistress are both referred to as "him", or when people spout off random dialogue during a discussion, it breaks the immersion a bit. Another broken mechanic is the EXTREMELY limited space in which you can build. The maps are small and the slightest hill will prevent you from placing a building. This leaves you with massive wide open spaces in an already tight fit. The only way I found to slightly get around this was to place different buildings in the same spot before they could be built in order to form a grotesque super structure.\n\nBut good luck playing the game if you decide to buy it anyway. There's no manual.\n\nUltimately, I never got to complete the game. The game ended up breaking after I had basically taken over the whole town. Would I play it if it was more polished and didn't feature a stifling dynasty tree? Yeah. It's not a bad concept. They just didn't do a good job of it.","October 9, 2015","false","15.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

I've played for several hours and i still think i have just barely gotten into it. Personally i like to play the rogue and its a rare game that instead of just having you have to be careful of the guards...this game allows you to apply for an office of political power and then use the guards to arrest your opponents. Guy not paying the protection money? send a thug around to spy on him, get some dirt on a crime he did and either take him to court or just arrest him outright, guy trying to collect hush money from your thieves and working girls? have them whip him up a refreshing poisoned drink!\n\nNow for the less criminally minded there are still so many (in fact probably more) Legal ways to earn money and rise to power. mining gems and aking them into some jewlery, making baked goods from a network of farms and mills and even running a bank. the game offers so much and concidering that i picked it up for around £4.49 for the complete package.

This game requires business acumen, political skills, guilt free consequence to climb to the top of the political ladder, gaming skill and overall patience for bugs (download patch 4.21).\n\nYou start with a man or women you have created (similar to the sims), choose one of four jobs (Patron, Rogue, Craftsman or scholar), choose the amount of other factions you play against (some similar to your chosen profession, which mean competition). Choose a map and town to start in and away you go.....life.\n\nSome starter tips:\n\n- Establish your bearings\n- Build a business\n- Buy a title\n- Court and marry a partner\n- Produce heirs...lots of heirs (some will die of disease, some will be killed and some will fail)\n- Level up\n- Apply for office (politics) - good luck if you win\n- Grow your business further\n- Have more heirs\n- Spend money on your heirs to go to school and get an apprenticeship\n- Invest in more businesses\n- Climb the political ladder\n- survive...this is life\n\n\n","June 2","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

So for TL;DR sake :\nDont buy unless you will play with friends (Need Tunngle for that), or just only tend to play games for a few hours at a time. (More under Cons).\n\nPros :\n- Its fun, and unique\n- Lots of replayability ~100 hr\n- Mischievous business tactics. How fun would it be to own a hospital, and in order to assume market control, you just burned down all the other hospitals? Plus, you get more customers in more ways than one ; )\n^ Or just assasinate all the workers\n- So many ways to play it, from owning a simple bakery to a massive supply chain, or becomming the ruler of a village. If you have enough money, you can even my an estate and start wars between countries!\n- Multiplayer is awesome, expecially if you like messing with your friends. (Oops, you're wife was assasinated? Wonder who did that..)\n\nCons :\n- Bugs. Like opening a Sarcophagus after a thousand years of fermenting human. You NEED the community created patches, however, said patches also add new features. Just make sure either way to get them!\n- AI absoulutely kicks the bucket if you play long enough. After maybe 3-4 hours, their entire family dies of old age and you just win. Even if you don't touch them. You really need people to play with for this reason.\n- Online portion is dead, and their servers are gone. To play with friends, you need the glorious Hamachi or Tunngle <-.\n\nJust pray to GOD Guild III is actually made.

It sort of spans across multiple genres - it's part RPG, it's part city-builder and it's part trade simulation. It's really a fantastic blend which offers an enormous potential for a perfect game, but sadly the game falls just short of that mark due to a cumbersome interface and some annoying bugs. But the new developer who took over the title (Runeforge) has made appreciable improvements and bug fixes which let's you really enjoy the game.\n\nIf you're willing to put up with a bit of a tough learning curve and a rough interface then this title is something that can be extremely fun and exciting.","December 30, 2011","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After scrolling through Steam, I stumbled upon this game and saw the reviews which made me rather curious and I bought the game. I installed it and tried to start the game. It wouldn't then I went to google and for about 45 minutes, I was able to play the game by disabling the cinematic opening and putting it into Windowed Mode. When you start the game and create your character, you are already starting your life. There is no tutorial, just small tips every so often. Since I had no idea what I was doing, I ended up restarting around 5 times. I was able to understand what I was going to do and have a stable income per round. However, was I having fun? I don't honestly know. But what I do know was that for 6 hours straight, I couldn't stop myself from playing. I just kept going through round through round trying to earn money and I didn't seem bored or have fun. I just kept playing.\n\nPeople have mentioned this game is really buggy. Have I seen it? Not yet. I say yet because the only problems I've come upon are opening the game and seeing some groups get stuck infront of a hospital. I probably will encounter those but that's after I play a lot more which I most likely will.\n\nDo I recommend the game? Yeah, of course I do. It's a good game. You'll get addicted to it when you know how to play it. It'll take time because in this one, there is no tutorial so you'll have to look it up but it's fun regardlss. However, it's definitely not for everyone. If you don't have the patience for this. You probably won't like this game.","November 27, 2015","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I was able to live vicariously through my characters bringing my family from organized crime and into politics and banking to become the most powerful man in Danzig.  My first wife contracted leporasy, was an unforutnately a patron and had only gotten pregnant with one child.  So I divorced her and had her killed at my mercenary fortress outside the city where my men were killing bandits and collecting tolls.  I also used my mercenarys and thugs to track and inform on other criminals while my men at the thieves guild pickpocketed while the gypsies and wanderers I hired to tell fortunes and use crystal balls to shill people out of money.  I abused every political position I was in to get ahead, once while I was summoned to court as I was head on the dungeon I order my bailors to bring in the procecutor to be lashed giving the appearence he missed court.  All evidence against me was dismissed.  I rose in political office until I was Marshal and head of the guards whom I made sure were not around whilst my men broke the bones or killed my enemies.  I also brought my new wife up in the political chain until I had become sovereign and her the head Magistrate in Danzig.  We rule the city with an Iron fist.  We wiped out the rival crime family  through ambushes between cities, setting houses on fire and slaughtering inhabitants as they run out of flaming buildings and condemming buildings my thugs damage abusing my power as Sovereign while I banished anyone in the political office who would not vote my wife or children's way in application of office.  A rival family of doctors and churchmen still stand in my way and surprisingly tend to be more resilient.  We find their honesty unsettling.  I have allowed one of their family members into a low level political office.  To keep my enemies close.  I have since turned my eyes to the larger city of Hamburg where I now plan to send my son as he graduates from university to begin banking and with our blood money we use to purchase noble titles with an end goal.  For the head of my house to become King.  No one will stand in our way.","April 2","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

This is truly one of my all time favorites.\n\nYou can build an empire and crush your enemies (or friends if you feel like it).  You are not stuck with the same job but can switch once you progress within the game.\n\nThe game experience is quiet unique and multiplayer is what makes this game really fun. The only downside is the out-if-sync issues. Once you have a few years in-game time the chances of getting a random disconnects from the game get greater. The newest patch has helped a lot but I feel that it will never be perfect.

Why not fabricate some evidence against him and then convict him extra harshly because you just happen to be the town's judge?\n\nThe possibilities for ♥♥♥♥ing other people up are endless, diverse, rich, satisfying and generally amazing.

A little eccentric when you first get into it but once you see how easy it is to pick up and build your empire its enthralling. You'll find between juggling your employees, working up the political ladder and keeping your (sometimes violent) rivals at bay, you'll have passed a couple hours without even noticing.\n\nProblem is, once you've gotten used to the mechanics and the game play, it can become pretty mundane. The game doesn't do much to change up the way you do things, and you'll quickly find yourself with an in-game routine. This routine will drag on and on as the computer controlled characters become much too predictable. Couple that with lack of online support and you're left with a game that far undershoots its potential. The Runeforge game studio forum has a relatively active modding community for this game, fixing bugs and adding maps, but as far as i've seen they've yet to try anything more adventurous than that.\n\nIf its on sale its definitely worth a shot.","January 14, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blurredexistence/recommended/39680/","blurredexistence","BlurredExistence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blurredexistence/","240 products in account","(Taken from my Guild 2 Review)\n\nThis game claims to be an RPG... it isn't. What it is is a management sim and it ain't a very deep one at that. For something that's supposed to be about you living the medieval life there's not an awful lot of you livin' a life and probably a bit too much of you micro-managing your businesses and your employees. It is possible to set the AI to manage the buisnesses you build but you're very unlikely to make a sustanible profit doing that.\n\nThe political system seems interesting at first but once you've climbed to the top it doesn't feel very fulfilling, and it doesn't add anything to the game to make you want to continue playing longer.\n\nThe family system could've been interesting if it wasn't for the fact that it requires almost no effort what-so-ever. The most complicated thing you'll do is court your mate, but all that consists of is using four or five actions in the right order to increase your prospective spouse's affection, but each of these actions have a linked cool down with the rest so you have to wait a good few hours of ingame time (you can speed up the clock thankfully) before you can perform the next compliment. Children you send to school with a push of a button and there's no need to keep either parent at home to look after them either.\n\nCombat does exist in this game as does criminal actions but it's all rather pointless, you'll be far more successful running a lawful business than you ever would a criminal one and using actions like threats or murder are far too risky and made pointless by the fact that you can just bribe anyone and everyone into liking you.\n\nI find it hard to decide whether or not to recommend this game. Yes i've been critical but as a management game it's not bad and i've certainly played worse. It does carry an interesting premise, if not a particularly well implimented one. What it comes down to with me is, tho, the fact that it claims to be an RPG and a medieval life simulator and it's just not.\n\nA word of advice if you still wish to pick this game up go for the Renaissance stand-alone expansion since it has everything that both the main game and the Pirates expansion offers.","July 15, 2014","false","11.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Close the game and restart it and things work again.\n\n\n+ The game concept is nice\n\n\n+ The context overlaps with other games like Patrician (1400s Europe)\n\n\n+ The game is funny.

Eventually she'll start making weapons, armours and other such goodies, I try to "encourage" her to sell to me and my rag-tag band of ruffians so that I can get a nice discount and then ensure that she doesn't get pestered by robbers, hoodlems and those damn Tax collectors.\n\nOne of the main things i love about this game is the attention to detail, the little things that you can do, taking your courted partner for a dance, or a shared bath at the local Tavern (Which is usually run by a player/NPC who profits from your actions), having a bevvy in the pub - drinking too much and becoming a beligerent fool! Ailments! Ailments that are really well done, sprained ankles, colds that develop into pneumonia which becomes deadly if left untreated, there goes your long lasting dynasty!\n\nCharacter Progression: There are 4 main classes Patron/Rogue/Craftsman/Scholar, who all progress in their chosen professions unlocking better buildings, more staff to beat and better products to manufacture/sell/steal. Behind all this is your character, whom you create through a fairly decent character creator, who then acquires XP by performing tasks, this XP can then be spent on upgrading his attributes which all have an affect on how well a character can perform certain tasks. Stealth for instance, decreases the chance you'll be spotted by guards when burgarling and scouting buildings. Dexterity, another useful stat, increase your characters speed and ability to dodge attacks. Constitution , the most important, increases your characters raw HP pool and allows you to carry more items per trip, why steal 1 sword when you can steal4 eh?\n\nPolicitcal System: there is a very deep and intricate political system, I haven't dabbled too much in it but once your character has title of certain quality he can run for certain positions, most of which come with their own perks.\n\nDungeon Master: Control the torturers.\nGeneral: Control town Guards.\nMayor: Embezzle money and set building tax.\n\nThere are many, many more but don't forgot you will always have to battle for these positions, by using either pure brutality and murdering anyone who dare run for your position, or political espionage, accuse them of crimes or put up stupid posters in the town square that accuses them of the most ludicrous things and watch as passers by read and laugh.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nBugs, seriously just those damn bugs. Some are game breaking like going out of sync in Multiplayer (Save frequently to avoid) and others are just daft, like hand carts being pulled by nothing... nothing at all.... it just rolls... by itself... weird as hell, even the unit portrait loses it's person.\n\nActions stop working: Sometimes buildings can become bugged and stop you performing certain actions on them, a little annoying when that very lucrative gem mine is right next door :(\n\nIn summary, I entirely recommend this game, whether you want a fast paced game or you want a slow sim game.\n\nGameplay 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nReplayability 10/0\nAudio 7/10\n\nTLDR: Good game, can murder innocent tax collectors!","May 12, 2015","true","38.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get to choose a job from a list of medieval professions and build a little dynasty around your business ventures. The resulting story arcs are very entertaining, very much like the kind you get in Crusader Kings. However, in Guilds you don't have to worry about commanding armies. You get to concentrate on all that juicy stuff; parties, trials, sabotage, courting, lampoons, heresy and MONEY.\n\nThe Guild II is okay, but I personally think that the first game is actually better than the sequel, because it's more atmospheric and compact. The interface is less confusing and movement is easy since you don't have to move your little avatar around the town in order to get things done.\n\nThese games are old, so the graphics aren't going to blow your mind. But who cares, if you can make a pact with the devil and sacrifice your first born so you can finally become a lease master or whatever even though everyone in the city despises you.

The latest patch is not part of the steam download and must be downloaded from their website, and the "best" patch is the beta one, due to the developers not wanting to release a new one until they're sure it's finalized. Nothing in the game is streamlined. AI for your buildings made this worse for me which forces you to take the time to micromanage each business individually. Characters are seperated into professions which makes sense, however the seperation between building functions within the professions becomes extremely tedious, getting to the point were it sometimes doesn't even make sense. The rogue profession especially is limited by this. As far as money and the economy goes, it is fairly easy for the economy to crash. The longer you play through a game you will notice the economy starting to slowly worsen. Despite rival dyanasties reaching massive ammounts of money midway through the game their businesses weren't producing anything, and only base level items and resources were being put into the market. Despite this, it would usually become more profitable in the long run to also only have your businesses produce the 1st tier of items as well. Nobody would be buying the high tier ones, and as the supply went up the profit from selling them would go down for me until it would stay consistantly low for a few turns. This was an issue that stayed constant from almost every game I started, regardless of my profession. As I was playing a Rogue I would in turn be limited to this as well. It would take longer to upgrade my buildings, pay for employees, etc. since what was being stolen was only the low tier items the AI was producing. The flipside to this was that if I essentially wanted to exploit the game you could build a pub, play dice, and just keep reloading your save until you actually win a large sum of money and repeat when needed.\n\nTo be fair, I was playing the game with the legacy mod installed with the right patch, and this fixed many glitches regarding the AI, but did  not fix some of the combat and job  issues with your characters taking prolonged periods of time before they would actually do what they were told to do.\n\nTo elaborate, the game isn't horrible. It's just that if you're expecting to the game to run smoothly you're going to be dissapointed, finding how long it takes to do even the simplest of tasks in RTSes taking much more time.. Likewise, if you're expecting the game to become as in depth as far as the economy for it goes, you will also be dissapointed. It's fun to mess around in if you just take it for what it is, but with issues going uncorrected and the use of an outdated game engine for this stand alone "expansion," I can't get behind it. It's a wonderful idea and I really like the game's direction, so I feel very backhanded for saying I can't recommend this game to my friends. In the end however; I can't see myself paying even $10 for it if I had known about the issues I'd have with it before.","May 15, 2014","false","6.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","3"

It combines an economic simulation with building up a dynasty by giving you control over the individuals and their abilities.  The problem is it feels like an alpha. Even if the latest beta patch did improve the game in terms of glitches and crashes, the barebone mechanics will drive you insane.\n\nFor example, at the forefront of this game sits trading. The tools given to you for this purpose will just infuriate you. Sure, you can micromanage the trade routes in your chain of production, but this aspect is barely implemented. It's pointless to explain, but bottom line you'll find yourself tweaking the routes over and over again. The game doesn't handle properly overproduction mixed with multiple goods to transfer, partial mid route dropoffs are broken, starting the route only allows you to select the quantity of goods present in your buildings at that moment in time, and the list can go on. You'll end up transporting only one type of goods between point A and B. You can turn on the AI for this, but if you do, expect to get even more frustrated. The AI is making dumb decisions such as dropping off finished goods back to the building that produced the original raw resource (probably because it was in the way, who knows), buying goods from the market even though you have buildings that produce the goods in your production chain, filling up your buildings with raw materials leaving no room for the finished goods. Oh don't worry, this is not the only aspect lacking in the game, but it's by far the most important.\n\nThis game is the perfect example of stretching the goals and having to deal with a scope creep that got out of control, leading to something that simply can't be called a finished product.","March 18","false","16.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I have all of them on cd still but decided to buy the steam version when it was on sale just to have a back up.\n\nIts somewhat of a niche game though. I highly doubt the vast majority of people would enjoy it. Its very slow and time consuming, especially if you go multiplayer. The game is incredibly buggy also. Most of the bugs are not game breaking but they can get very annoying. I reccomend heavily modding the game. Its fairly easy to do and mostly involves changing numerical values in text and if your able to understand basic html you shouldnt have a problem really working with the files to get what you need done. (i know the coding isnt in html but it isnt much more difficult than that to edit).\n\nPersonally i love the game. Die Gilde i spent tons and tons of hours on. 2 I have quite a bit of time into as well just killing time at work and home. I personally like to make the game as difficult as possible for myself. I start with almost no money and a house and give the npcs a bunch of advantages. But for lighter game play id reccomend giving yourself a big advantage which is easily done by editing the config file and changing a few numbers.\n\nAll in all id give it a 7.5/10 due mostly to bugs and difficulty setting up multiplayer matches (which require you to have all files exactly the same in a game that needs major editing to work at least somewhat properly). But i want to note this game is not going to be up everyones alley for certain and while i think people should at least try it i know many will be dissapointed.","October 28, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Mixing RPG, business management, Sims-style social interaction management and city sim elements into a totally unique genre all its own.  Building a business empire is surprisingly satisfying, and the open-ended gameplay can keep things interesting in terms of character variety.\n\nThe Bad:  Balance is utterly terrible, two professions earn flat-out more money than any other, the other two can barely be self-supporting and will take generations (literally) to build to a comparable level, by that time the unforgiving AI will have left you far behind.  The game presents the appearance of great depth, but it's ultimately a rather shallow experience with most paths being dead-ends compared to the most lucrative.  The amount of micromanagement is severe, and often frustrating given the time-scale needed to acheive significant gains.  Gameplay gets repeitive with numerous game-breaking powerful paths (like spamming bribes until everyone loves you, while selling endless stacks of herring), if you try not to use those broken paths the AI steamrolls you.\n\nThe Bottom Line:  A great game marred by bugs and poorly thought out gameplay.\n\nYou'd like this if:  You're a fan of city-building with RPG elements, you don't mind micromanagement, You thought the only thing The Sims was missing was a poorly-thought-out business sim and the ability to firebomb your neighbors.","March 1, 2015","true","20.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LethalFinch/recommended/39680/","LethalFinch","LethalFinch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LethalFinch/","142 products in account","(version 4.20 Review)\n\nTLDR: Broken beyond belief. Not worth your time even if it were free...\n\nHonestly, I tried really hard to have fun with this game. 11 to 12 hours of solid gameplay, 2 hours of learning form videos about this game on youtube, cause I was thinking: "there must be something I'm missing here. Either I just don't know about all the mechanics, or I'm doing something wrong, or both...". But no, none of that was the case. The problem with this game is that it is just plain broken. Out of all the mechanics in the game that are at the player's disposel, only 1 actually works (if only clumsilly).\n\nThe impression I get from this game as far as what the dev's envisioned is bassically Crusader Kings turned Sims. Or even think of this game like this: turn House of Cards into a PC game, and set it in the medieval/renaissance era. Which, when hashed out on paper, sounds great and I think there's actually a need for a game like that in the PC market. Unfortunately, The execution on this game is just not there.\n\nThe only mechanic that actually works 100% of the time in this game is the charchter's ability to make money, but making money in this game is not fun. it's a mindless 'Point & Click' chore. Every other mechanic is just down right broken.\n\nWant one of your character's to rob someone? Tough, cause it's broken. I actually took the time to find every single chacter on the map I was playing on (and I mean EVERYONE) and tried to rob them with both my main character and my "henchmen", and the game would not allow me to attempt to rob anyone. So then I thought: "ok, maybe it's the buildings that I'm supposed to rob". Tried to rob everysingle building on the map, and again, no dice. So why even have it in the game if it's broken?!?\n\nWant to bribe the Mayor to ellect you into office? Don't bother, because every other applicant will bribe him for the exact same amount you do, which essentially nullifies all the bribes given by everyone because he ends up equally favouring everyone. In one particualr ellection, I decided to show up to the council meeteing early so that I could bribe him right there in the council hall before the voting started. I then watched hillariously as every single npc in the council hall handed him a sack of money. I was like number 8 in line with my bribe. Needless to say, I wasted my money and so did the npc's.\n\nWant to Sabbotage a business owend by a competing faction? Tough nuts, because Sabbotaging a building doesn't have any effect on the business' abilty to function what so ever. Because you have to sabbotage it multiple times and there's a 7 hour cool down period on the sabbotage ability (in-game time of course), and by the time you've bombed the business enough for it to actually have an effect, someone's just going to lay charges against you and throw your bung-hole in jail. Sure, you can pull off 1 or 2 sabbotages with out having too much incriminating evidence floating around, but it takes more than that, so you will get caught. So therefore, pointless.\n\nI'm not even scratching the surface here. There are sooooooo many broken mechanics that I do not have the time or the patients to list them all here.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI bought this game on sale for under 3 bucks, and I feel very lucky that I didn't spend any more then that. And please, don't buy into the youtube videos that supposedly show you how this game works and then claim its a "good game"....In fact, now that I think back, every video I watched never contained a single second of mid-game or even late-game play time. And that makes alot of sense, because this game is 'deceptivley' broken:\n\nIn the first 2 hours of the first playthrough, you might feel proud that you've started a thriving business, gotten married and had kids to carry on your "Dynasty", and bought your familly a higher "Title", and that will give you the illusion that this game is "Fun". But then when you try to make use of all the game mechanics provided for you in order to progress further than that (i.e. get ellected in to office, hostel take-over of competing dynasty's buildings, bribery and blackmail, etc...), you'll slowly find that those game mechanics just do not work at all. And its sad. because the idea behind this game is so great. Motives for this game were great; method's in making this game were crack-♥♥♥. There are early access games that are more pollished than this game, and bare in mind, this game is on it's 4th itteration already...\n\nSo no, I can not, in good clean conciense, recommend this game, even if it were free, let allone 80% off. Sorry dev's, but you bought a really bad, sour apple here.

I don't know what I like more, the frequent visual bugs, the constant presence of the black plague in maps without hospitals, or the fact that sometimes the language randomly switches to german. Designing a character is about as stimuating as Perelli's miracle elixir but unfortunately you don't get to keep that character for long because he will either die of the plague or be turned invisible by a rogue memory leak. The day to day gameplay, aside from when your guarded carts are being pillaged by old ladies and your house next to the guard's post is being robbed, is pretty standard. You build a farm and you watch your character farm. This goes on for the entire game, although occasionally you get to randomly hug people and marry them so they can bear you children who will continue to work on your farm and continue the whole ugly cycle.

Unfortunate that game breaking bugs still exist, and are even worse when the save game is corrupted well into a playthrough and can not be reversed.

At least half the bugs people complain about are not bugs, it is people not being interested in figuring out how the game is played. Are there bugs? Yes, but as a rule it is not all that hard to play around them, and i have successfully played around them for years.\n\nTo my astonished suprise though, this game is suddenly being updated. I mean who updates a game 5 years later?! These guys are doing just that. And not tiny updates, we are talking full on bug bashing. Sure it looks like they are taking some fixs from the community mods and implementing them into the game, but they give credit for it and why shouldn't they? I am honestly sick and tired of unofficial patches fixing all the things a company is too lazy to do themselves. Especially when most of the work is done for you. Thank you Guild II devs, you are geniuses.\n\nThis game is massively complicated, with so many different game mechanics you will have to completely relearn it when you change classes. Sometimes these varying mechanics can be so complicated and different you will find yourself scouring the internet to find answers on how and what to do. A bad thing? Maybe. Even after hundreds of hours there are still things i can not figure out, and its honestly irksome. Large portions of witches and wizards and alchemists are a mystery to me, and i have yet to find anything online to explain how they work. So i am assumign this lack of information means others are as stymied as i am. If anyone knows how summoning circles and transmutation works, please for the love of god explain it to me!\n\nIf you like the idea of being able to mod your game, you will enjoy this game. It has mods, lots of mods. It is beginning to seem though the intergration of some of the better mods means you wont have to go through the trouble of downloading them, and some are making their way into the game itself thanks to a rebirth by the devolpers.\n\nIf you ever loved the concept of the sims, or better yet breathed heavy over medieval sims, and yet felt insulted how easy the game was, you will be in heaven with Guild II renaissance. I wish there were more ways to decorate houses and businesses, but buying upgrades and having them appear is still rather satisfying. Equiping and arming you player characters is fun enough, though i would like a more immersive system and choice of clothes.\n\nWhat I think game is missing:\n\n- Interactions with NPCS that aren't 100% game plot driven. You can talk to NPCS to bribe them. Or woo them. Or threaten them. But you never really get to interact with this big world for just fun reasons. Give me a "Hey bill, whats up bro" option please.\n\n- More stuff to make at your job. Does it need it really? No. But it would be nice if they grew the massive economy more to be epically huge and new options to build more things at your shops and crafthalls. I suppose having so much just makes me greedy for more. And in all honesty it is unlikley super difficult for the devs to give us more.  Therefore since the bug squash has begun, maybe soon enough we will get treated to more a content addition. After all there are lots of unofficial mods out there with some neat things, maybe some will be made official.\n\n- Bug fixes. but these are coming.

At least half the bugs people complain about are not bugs, it is people not being interested in figuring out how the game is played. Are there bugs? Yes, but as a rule it is not all that hard to play around them, and i have successfully played around them for years.\n\nTo my astonished suprise though, this game is suddenly being updated. I mean who updates a game 5 years later?! These guys are doing just that. And not tiny updates, we are talking full on bug bashing. Sure it looks like they are taking some fixs from the community mods and implementing them into the game, but they give credit for it and why shouldn't they? I am honestly sick and tired of unofficial patches fixing all the things a company is too lazy to do themselves. Especially when most of the work is done for you. Thank you Guild II devs, you are geniuses.\n\nThis game is massively complicated, with so many different game mechanics you will have to completely relearn it when you change classes. Sometimes these varying mechanics can be so complicated and different you will find yourself scouring the internet to find answers on how and what to do. A bad thing? Maybe. Even after hundreds of hours there are still things i can not figure out, and its honestly irksome. Large portions of witches and wizards and alchemists are a mystery to me, and i have yet to find anything online to explain how they work. So i am assumign this lack of information means others are as stymied as i am. If anyone knows how summoning circles and transmutation works, please for the love of god explain it to me!\n\nIf you like the idea of being able to mod your game, you will enjoy this game. It has mods, lots of mods. It is beginning to seem though the intergration of some of the better mods means you wont have to go through the trouble of downloading them, and some are making their way into the game itself thanks to a rebirth by the devolpers.\n\nIf you ever loved the concept of the sims, or better yet breathed heavy over medieval sims, and yet felt insulted how easy the game was, you will be in heaven with Guild II renaissance. I wish there were more ways to decorate houses and businesses, but buying upgrades and having them appear is still rather satisfying. Equiping and arming you player characters is fun enough, though i would like a more immersive system and choice of clothes.\n\nWhat I think game is missing:\n\n- Interactions with NPCS that aren't 100% game plot driven. You can talk to NPCS to bribe them. Or woo them. Or threaten them. But you never really get to interact with this big world for just fun reasons. Give me a "Hey bill, whats up bro" option please.\n\n- More stuff to make at your job. Does it need it really? No. But it would be nice if they grew the massive economy more to be epically huge and new options to build more things at your shops and crafthalls. I suppose having so much just makes me greedy for more. And in all honesty it is unlikley super difficult for the devs to give us more.  Therefore since the bug squash has begun, maybe soon enough we will get treated to more a content addition. After all there are lots of unofficial mods out there with some neat things, maybe some will be made official.\n\n- Bug fixes. but these are coming. Some of my biggest long standing gripes are wiped away with the new patches at the end of 2014. I love you devolpers. Seriously i do!\n\nIn the end is this game a buy? ARE YOU KIDDING?! you can find it on sale sometimes for $2.50 and even if its not on sale, $10 is a steal!

It has a lot of great ideas that could potentially be used by other games later on. I find it quiet enjoyable to play as a rogue family and make toll booths with my mercenaries so that all the carts must go through me to get the goods were they need to be. No one likes me at the end of the game though *shrug*. I enjoy owning a mine, making huge bank, and then spending that bank to actually build a bank for my Doctorate son. I enjoy running an inn, and watching all the serfs spend all their hard-earned money getting drunk after a long days work. Though this game does have some bugs, but none of which are game breaking. For instance, the AI is too pacisft, never really bothering to interrupt my family other then maybe plundering my new tiny shop, or beating up my sons second wife. I only got murdered twice in the hours I have spent. The learning curve has gotten harder, for originally in PotES, buildings were going on sale left and right, but now buildings are rarely sold, adding a bit of competition to the game. Another issue I have with the game is that titles are WAY too expensive compared to PotES and the original. I do like how becoming a nobleman to become a king is a lot harder now, but 100000 gold? I could get a baron title with that in the other games! They do add other titles to fill in the gaps with the game, but they just dont feel right to have. These things are minor things however, and can be overlooked. Most people have modded the game to fix these problems, and you can find a lot of them at Runeforge's forums.","June 9, 2014","true","111.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are definitely issues with compatability and gameplay but its playable for the most part and in windowed-mode to boot.  I don't see a point in getting the original Guild II as this seems to include everything in the original and the pirates version, except for the tiny "campaign", plus a few new building/professons.  The AI is ok but seems deadset on killing you, especially members of the other dynasties when they can.  It is also quite annoying that your family members do absolutely nothing but sit in the house and die unless you control them as one of the three controlable character slots.  Seems to me they missed on one of the biggest strategies of the medeval period, that of inter-marriage of noble families to consolidate power and settle disputes.  You only have the option of courting random jobless serfs with reputations that change every time you check their profile.

As it stands, it's a great time with or without mods.\nIDK if you can play online offically, but LAN works and it's insane. You'll hate your friends, and love the game.\nI couldn't recomend this game highly enough. It's like Crusader Kings II knocked up The Sims.\nExtort your local shop owner today!","July 19, 2014","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea is pretty much unique, as you start controlling the life of someone who has an entrepreneur spirit, meaning that you have a considerable amount of freedom to pursue a specific craft (hiring employees and everything), or maybe engaging in politics. Besides that, the person that you create can also get married with other people and have children, which is something that increases the number of members on the family (it's a shame that you can only control 3 of them at the same time). In order to survive and to win the game, you literally need to find a way to eradicate all the means of competition (rival families). The fun part is that you can use your creativity to find ways to do that. For example, depending of your political position in the government, you can literally be untouchable, in other words, you may hire assassins to remove certain people out of the way and also destroy your rivals' buildings without having to worry about further consequences. You can be promoted to further rankings in politics simply by flattering with influential people and that goes for the 3 people that you control at the same time. Just a friendly advice: Don't forget to apply the latest patch! Have fun *evil laugh*.","March 31, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Build a dynasty through trade, shadowy power and political intrigue.\n\nAt first with only one or two business, things go well. You start earning money and feel a sense of accomplishment as your fledging trade empire grows. You notice a few problems and bugs such as a pause system that work by slowing down the game to a crawl and also, slow down your user interations to a crawl, pathing issues where npcs get stuck, your char keep running and stopping behind an npc, trying to interact with him/her never succeeding, but still tolerable.\n\nThen you got robbed. Which is fine, wealth is nothing without the force to defend it. You hire guards to patrol your buildings and defend you. And you got rob again. You stare in disbelieve as your char and guards do nothing as you order them to attack (possible pathing bug?), only after the thief is running away then your guards start chasing futilely. Ok, lesson learned. You build watch towers right in front of your structures, build a mercenary fortress and plant mercenaries right in front of your shop in toll collecting mode, security and money making, both at sametime, seems to work.\n\nAs time goes on, your trade empire grows and you start getting annoyed with all the micomanagement required to make sure supply flows smoothly or else the whole chain will grind to a halt. You tweak your trade routes such that they move just the "right" amount of goods without flooding the recipent (a shop with no space storage cannot produce stuff) and constantly move crafted good from storage to sale slot because there is no way to automate that. When you think that maybe, just maybe you can get this under control, you accidentally end the day with a negative balance after your employees are paid and your whole house of cards came crashing down. All trade routes cancels when your balance become negative, carts halt right in front of the stall they are suppose to sell to.\n\nOk fine, maybe you know, this game isn't suppose to be micromanaged? You turn over the shops to the AI and build structures from the rouge tree (which doesn't need resources and require min micromanagement). Things start to get managable again. You start getting a good feeling, maybe soon you will be able to finish upgrading all your buildings and start running for office.\n\nThen the game crash. Well, tough luck, good thing you as a veteran gamer have the good habit of saving regularly. You load the last save... and the game crash immediately again. You load the save before the last, and the game crash again.\n\n- End of review","April 2, 2015","false","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not perfect mind you but solid. If you are a fan of simulation games like The Sims, or are fan of business games then this game can be enjoyable for you.\n\nPro\n-There are quite a few different maps available for play. So finding a change of scenery in the game is possible, but there is no way to create your own maps which is too bad.\n-There are a lot of different store types in the game to experiment with\n-There is more than just business. Family management and politics are present as well\n-The timeline of the game takes place in what I say is a fairly unique setting. Few games of this type take place in that area of history\n\nCon\n-Although there are a lot of maps for play the replay value on this game is weak. Much of the gameplay is the same no matter which map you play on.\n-There is quite a clear lack of balance between the jobs in the game. Some earn fantastic amounts of money while others make close to zero even with all of there upgrades. As well a new player has no way to know this until they play more of the game.\n-The AI is quite weak. They are unable to build or politcally compete with the player in any meaningful way. This means that once the player has gained any bit of power they will have nothing more than limp rivals to contend.\n-There are many bugs in this game. I frequently found my family in the game out thousands of dollars because one of the characters could not 'find a path' to a feature. This was just one of the many that were present.\n\nAll in all if you like economic games and simulators this game does have its fun. However the fun is limited and its replay becomes shortlived with the lack of functional AI. ** out of ***** for the average gamer I would say.","April 17, 2015","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea is pretty much unique, as you start controlling the life of someone who has an entrepreneur spirit, meaning that you have a considerable amount of freedom to pursue a specific craft (hiring employees and everything), or maybe engaging in politics. Besides that, the person that you create can also get married with other people and have children, which is something that increases the number of members on the family (it's a shame that you can only control 3 of them at the same time). In order to survive and to win the game, you literally need to find a way to eradicate all the means of competition (rival families). The fun part is that you can use your creativity to find ways to do that. For example, depending of your political position in the government, you can literally be untouchable, in other words, you may hire assassins to remove certain people out of the way and also destroy your rivals' buildings without having to worry about further consequences. You can be promoted to further rankings in politics simply by flattering with influential people and that goes for the 3 people that you control at the same time. Just a friendly advice: Don't forget to apply the latest patch! Have fun *evil laugh*.","March 31, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the ye olde buisness tycoon style of other games such as the Port Royale and Patrician series (both of which i am mixed on to whether liking or hating) but with a sort of a sim style to the approach. Its a weird but interesting little mix of the buisness aspect but also controlling your own characters and how they can effect the game. Voice acting is...tolerable. I wish the developers could have just stuck with sim giberish and text boxes. The graphics are okay nothing special and yes there are a ton of bugs.\n\nHowever I find that there is a lot of replay ability if you install the fanmade patch for the game as it fixes most of the games issues. There are mulitple different classes to choose, different buisnesses to operate and a political system to get involved in. However once again the AI is smart just not smart enough if you want a  major challenge. You can imprison, commit arson, kidnap, or even murder your competition and take over there buisness. Intermarrying classes works to your advantage so yo can opertate outside of your own characters limits and the generational effect is a nice touch. So i would reccomend this game because for $9.99 you get a little more than you paid for in replayability and because the concept of buisness tycoon with medieval politics and simulation is a great concept...it just wasn't done well here. I say give it a try and see what you think if you like it great if not well steam has a refund policy now.","June 24, 2015","true","88.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a lot to do and several ways to do many things.

I also have not tried the rogue bits.\n\nPros:\n-	Fairly deep simulation of economy and politics.\n-	Loads of corruption and fun.\n-	Opportunities to mess with the unsuspecting.\n-	Hours of mechanic learning and production cycle exploitation.\n-	Hilarious romantic simulation.\nCons\n-	Dated graphics.\n-	Not too much in the way of character customization.\n-	Somewhat difficult to learn.\n\nWhile playing this it kind of struck me as similar to an X game (e.g., Terrain conflict, Albion Prelude) in a renaissance world. Player owned supply chains? Check. Lots of merchanting? Check. Having more money than the entire town/sector probably should? Check! It must be an X game. As far as the ease of access goes, with a small amount of time most of the game play mechanics become fairly second nature.

It's just a lot of fun! Dueling an enemy who keeps running against you in office, having your goons follow people around gathering evidence against them for court, poisoning the well of the other town where your rival dynasty lives and then burning down the hospital so if, IF they survive the long trek to your hospital (which happens to be the only one left - oops), they have to pay way above the normal prices... these things are awesome! Don't like politics and running for office? Be a scholar, create the mage's guild, build a firebomb and then destroy a city! Don't feel like all that? Be a bandit - kidnap and murder people for fun! Need the life of a farmer, just making bread from the wheat you grow? .... ok.

Once this is accomplished, the game feels as though it has run its course, but the stories generated by the hours-long journey there are fit to rival any Hollywood plot. The sheer number of options given to criminals in The Guild II is dizzying. Kidnapping, murder, bombing, arson, mugging; and these are just some of the options given to civilians, never mind the awful things you can do to rival factions, or even the Royal Family, if you are elected to a post that gives command over the city guards. That these things can be done to a rival family controlled by a human player; that you can have agents stalk other players, to witness their various crimes and report them to the authorities, or bomb their gold mine, crippling their entire production chain, makes this game an absolute joy to play. It really is something special.\n\nIf you'd like to read a more in-depth review, have a look at my new site!

In broad terms it's a game about business management and politics. It's filled with bugs and game ending crashes. It's got a slow pace and tons of micro management.  But it's fun and challenging. There's a lot of different ways to succeed, and you can play it good or bad or just mind your business. The game has lot's of issues when it comes to multiplayer. Out of sync errors are something you get used to. The auto-savings helps with that. what I love the most about it though is the silly quirks it has, weird humour and not really taking itself too seriously. Where the sims is about amassing stuff and crap; This game is about being a Citizen, political or otherwise and amassing wealth for your dynasty.\n"You are a knave!" yes... yes... I know.\n9/10","July 21, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are definitely outdated and it is SUPER BUGGED!!! You can even play one game, start a new one without changing any settings, and suddenly people can run for mayor without holding any office, you can buy any building regardless of type and other immersion breaking (though easily exploitable) situations.\n\nThose things aside though; BUY THIS GAME! It's just a lot of fun! Dueling an enemy who keeps running against you in office, having your goons follow people around gathering evidence against them for court, poisoning the well of the other town where your rival dynasty lives and then burning down the hospital so if, IF they survive the long trek to your hospital (which happens to be the only one left - oops), they have to pay way above the normal prices... these things are awesome! Don't like politics and running for office? Be a scholar, create the mage's guild, build a firebomb and then destroy a city! Don't feel like all that? Be a bandit - kidnap and murder people for fun! Need the life of a farmer, just making bread from the wheat you grow? .... ok. You can do that too, if you're really wanting to for some reason.\n\nIt's an excellent game with a bit older graphics but tons of fun still left in it. I fully recommend it!","June 15, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

But around 30-60 seconds after the dawn of the second day, the game would crash and the save would fail. There's so many other bugs too, like not being able to build on some maps, and some maps just don't appear correctly, etc. I was willing to put up with all that stuff, because this game is that much fun, but automatic corruption of saved games as soon as the first day ends?

The graphics are definitely outdated and it is SUPER BUGGED!!! You can even play one game, start a new one without changing any settings, and suddenly people can run for mayor without holding any office, you can buy any building regardless of type and other immersion breaking (though easily exploitable) situations.\n\nThose things aside though; BUY THIS GAME! It's just a lot of fun! Dueling an enemy who keeps running against you in office, having your goons follow people around gathering evidence against them for court, poisoning the well of the other town where your rival dynasty lives and then burning down the hospital so if, IF they survive the long trek to your hospital (which happens to be the only one left - oops), they have to pay way above the normal prices... these things are awesome! Don't like politics and running for office? Be a scholar, create the mage's guild, build a firebomb and then destroy a city! Don't feel like all that? Be a bandit - kidnap and murder people for fun! Need the life of a farmer, just making bread from the wheat you grow? .... ok.

It has the ye olde buisness tycoon style of other games such as the Port Royale and Patrician series (both of which i am mixed on to whether liking or hating) but with a sort of a sim style to the approach. Its a weird but interesting little mix of the buisness aspect but also controlling your own characters and how they can effect the game. Voice acting is...tolerable. I wish the developers could have just stuck with sim giberish and text boxes. The graphics are okay nothing special and yes there are a ton of bugs.\n\nHowever I find that there is a lot of replay ability if you install the fanmade patch for the game as it fixes most of the games issues. There are mulitple different classes to choose, different buisnesses to operate and a political system to get involved in. However once again the AI is smart just not smart enough if you want a  major challenge. You can imprison, commit arson, kidnap, or even murder your competition and take over there buisness. Intermarrying classes works to your advantage so yo can opertate outside of your own characters limits and the generational effect is a nice touch. So i would reccomend this game because for $9.99 you get a little more than you paid for in replayability and because the concept of buisness tycoon with medieval politics and simulation is a great concept...it just wasn't done well here. I say give it a try and see what you think if you like it great if not well steam has a refund policy now.","June 24, 2015","true","88.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once this is accomplished, the game feels as though it has run its course, but the stories generated by the hours-long journey there are fit to rival any Hollywood plot. The sheer number of options given to criminals in The Guild II is dizzying. Kidnapping, murder, bombing, arson, mugging; and these are just some of the options given to civilians, never mind the awful things you can do to rival factions, or even the Royal Family, if you are elected to a post that gives command over the city guards. That these things can be done to a rival family controlled by a human player; that you can have agents stalk other players, to witness their various crimes and report them to the authorities, or bomb their gold mine, crippling their entire production chain, makes this game an absolute joy to play. It really is something special.\n\nIf you'd like to read a more in-depth review, have a look at my new site!

It's more or less a medieval version of sims ♥♥♥ business tycoon ♥♥♥ political simulator.\n\n+Many types of businesses you can choose to run in the game, each filling a certain market demand, and your town grows as you hire more employees.\n\n+Interesting political aspect to the game, including elections, where you climb your way up the political ladder for more privileges like immunity from the law.\n\n+Many options to dealing with your enemies, including dueling, defamation, taking them to court, kidnapping, or just plain murder.\n\nAnd now with the cons:\n\n-AI is terrible at managing certain high level businesses. It’s frankly quite broken and doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do.\n\n-Market demand is non existent for certain products. They will remain on the market  pretty much forever and depress the price. The AI doesn’t know how to utilize some of the higher level items and will never buy or make use of them against you.\n\n-Indicator during politics or court sessions not always reliable at predicting the result.\n\n-AI is more or less passive and relatively peaceful, making it pretty much impossible to be killed by one and thus lose the game. Even if you fast forward the game 40 years, the AI even at their meanest doesn’t go around killing people for the most part and while fighting amongst themselves not one of them will eliminate another. If any one of them is going to die it will be because of the player.\n\nMy overall impression is that the game had a pretty good and unique concept, but it was executed somewhat poorly. After all the patching it is pretty playable, but still somewhat buggy. Again, the main reason I’ll recommend it is because if you get it on discount, the value you get blows many other games you can get at a similar price point out of the water. Another thing to add is that the Guild 3 is supposedly coming out this year, so you can treat this game a bit like a preview as to what you may expect from the upcoming sequel.","January 10","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plus there is the part where you show other families that you love them or just beat the dog crap out of them through politics or violence.\n\nThe only down side to this game is the fact that it is buggy out the wahzoo.

I'm talking about - you have to restart the game - bugs...\n\nI guess this studio just got to a certain point and said, "Aye, it's playable enough...  call it done"\nWhen you first start the game, it says, "Version 4.17 BETA"\n\nIt's 10 years old now (the original Guild 2 game), and it plays like it is 18 years old.\nI played the original G2 way back in the day...

I loved playing the very first day over and over on so many different characters. Every bit of it was fun. But around 30-60 seconds after the dawn of the second day, the game would crash and the save would fail. There's so many other bugs too, like not being able to build on some maps, and some maps just don't appear correctly, etc. I was willing to put up with all that stuff, because this game is that much fun, but automatic corruption of saved games as soon as the first day ends?

I think its the difficulty curve. If you play on Easy you'll struggle to actually find a foothold in your chosen field the first few (tens of) times you play, or at least; you will if you're like me, but once you find the profession that  suits your play style and you find the strategy that works you'll find it becomes pretty simple to carve out the lineage that you know you deserve.\n\nFor the most part thats what I love about The Guild 2: Renaissance; the fact that its still amazingly fun even when you know what you're doing and  (In my opinion) even fun without challenge.\n\nWhen you get bored of that you'll be tempted to turn up the diffculty; call me an unskilled gamer if you like but I dont do that anymore... I simply find the  difficulty too hard and its not what I play the game for!\n\nOkay, so this review has been a little rambly but the point I'm trying to make is that this game is truly great, its great with massive amounts of challenge (Although thats not how I like to play it) and its great with basically no challenge.\nIts a very adaptable game, you can play it seriously and in "I AM BEST GAMER IN WORLD! HEAR ME ROAR!!" mode or you can play it in "My names Doris, I'm a mother of 4 and like a nice simple game to pass the time" mode.\n\nBuy it you fool!\n\n\n---Original Review---\n\nDespite what you may read/hear else where on the internet; this game genuinly is brilliant.\nIts a game that truly stands apart from others in its rather specific group. Its about being a nobody with dreams of being MORE than somebody.\n\nYou create a character, build a business, buy some stuff, then die.\nThen you try again; Create, Build, Buy, Sell, Get murdered.\nAnd again: Create, Build, Buy, Plague.\nAnd again: Create, Build, Dysentary.\nAgain: Create, Build, Buy, Sell, Marry, Children, Die, Children take over, Build more, Buy More, Get arrested, Die in prison.\nGive up.\nWait six months and repeat.\n\nIf that sounds like something you'd enjoy then get this game! (This one is also the best of the series so dont bother buying the others.)","April 21, 2015","true","81.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
