The game became popular because of one thing, and one thing only: it was scary. Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands likely bought this game because they wanted to get scared; they wanted a joyride complete with overwhelming fear. I don't blame them. The game is pretty scary, but here's the thing:\n\nIt seems that most people do not understand that Amnesia, and the games before it, were not just haunted-house amusement park rides like they like to act like it is. No, it's a lot more than that. The game has thick atmosphere, superb pacing and storytelling backed by a very dark story that keeps you curious from beginning and even to the end. To be able to truly appreciate TDD, you need to look further than the scare factor; it is not the only thing that made the game great. Guess what the Chinese Room capitalised on? The story. They wanted to tell a story, much like TDD did. MFP was much more of a psychological experience; the game did not need to scare you with darkness or spooky monsters, all it needed was an incredibly wicked story. This was fulfilled. I expected an atmospheric, thought-provoking horror experience that would keep me on the edge and this is exactly what the game did.\n\nBut what did everyone else expect? Probably something entirely different. They probably just wanted to get scared. Most of the fanbase is filled with people that appreciated TDD for nothing more than its scare factor, and therefor this is all they had expected from MFP. They are probably the kind of people that either skipped or skimmed through most of TDD's note readings, not givng a ♥♥♥♥ about the backstory whatsoever. They just wanted to get to the next "scare." The bad reception for this game purely comes from delusioned expectations, is what I believe. Horror is a much deeper genre than you'd think.

To start with the good, it excels at creating atmosphere.  There are some great scenes and very fitting music.  You get a small taste of a story that would probably have been interesting if they told you more of it, but then that’s all there is.\n\nThey give you an unlimited light source and simplify all other parts of the gameplay so you can just stroll through the one path they left you and let them tell you the story, which feels like a movie adaptation of a book where you can tell something's missing unless you've read the book, but there's no book.\n\nI can’t understand why they used the Amnesia title for this game which plays NOTHING like The Dark Descent.  It would have been a sort of okay game if they hadn’t tried to associate it with Amnesia, but since they did it's actually misleading on top of mediocre, so I recommend ignoring it and waiting for whatever comes out of Frictional next.","January 23, 2014","false","5.7"," 349 of 452 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","349","452","0","3"

It was developed by The Chinese Room: the studio behind Dear Escher. When I discovered that during its development, I became skeptical as to the quality of this game. I did, however, respect that it was a spiritual successor of Amnesia: The Dark Decent, and figured that it still had the opportunity to be an intriguing horror experience. I was incorrect.\n\nMy first complaint comes from simplified mechanics, of which there are barely any at all. The inventory system has been removed entirely, and with both health and sanity. Managing health becomes trivial, as there are no situations in which you must do so, while sanity has been removed altogether. Hiding in the darkness no longer has its trade offs, while looking at the monsters does nothing. Monsters now only make your electric lamp flicker from quite distance away, removing the fear of their presence. This is part of another changed mechanic: oil conservation has been done away with as well in favor of the infinite energy electric lamp. At this point, only the levels themselves are left to make the game live up to its predecessor, which they don't.\n\nThe game has been designed to be insultingly linear. Each level is a single, straight, path with no choices on how to proceed. The vast majority of monster encounters are scripted, along with a dozen or so out of place shock scares (I could reveal all of them and not spoil the plot). The levels themselves are badly designed and a pain to navigate, with large inaccessible areas and crappy lighting only made worse by the infinite lamp. The puzzles are all remarkably simple now that the inventory is gone. The only thing that makes this worse is the writing of the story.\n\nIn the first act, The Chinese Room makes sure you know they made it by coming in so heavy with metaphors that you can't decipher any real context until you are a good amount into the game. As you try to ground yourself in the game's story, TCR continuously throws "deeper meaning" straight at your face until the story becomes completely drowned in its own pretentious metaphors and symbolism by the third act in a way that is relatable to the Matrix trilogy. The only parts of the story that feel as though they actually belong in the Amnesia universe are the references to the original game (albeit with one glaring inconsistency).\n\nTL;DR:\nOverall, I disapprove of this game. The mechanics are simplified, the levels are horribly designed, and the story feels like it was written by an undergraduate art student. If you have never played Amnesia: The Dark Decent, buy that instead. If you have played it, then still don't buy this. Wait for SOMA.","December 24, 2013","false","7.4"," 192 of 241 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","192","241","0","0"

But the troubles start before you've even properly begun. The game is full of bugs. Forums are filled with people (myself included) trying to figure work-arounds for issues like constant in-game lag (has nothing to do with the quality of your rig or having the necessary audio/video drivers updated), random graphic hitches that filter the screen in a blue, washed-out color, and audio stuttering. Some of the fixes work, though mostly for temporary periods. If you do manage to run the game properly after all that:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ The environment is great. The mansion is atmospheric, spooky and interesting to explore.\n+ The voice acting is very good.\n\nCONS:\n\n- First and foremost: The game is just not scary. It's not Amnesia. It's Dark Esther. It's not survival and stealth, it's exploration. There's next to no tension.\n- The tinderboxes (requiring you to work on conserving them for light) are gone. Instead you have a lantern that never goes out. Considering that the mansion is pretty well lit 90% of the time, I found I hardly needed to use it (even with Gamma turned down)\n- The sanity system is gone, and with it the tense effort to remain sane in the wake of prowling monstrosities.\n- The monsters. The pigmonsters are not scary. They're just silly looking. They don't pursue you with the intensity of the creatures in Dark Descent and you can look at them without fear of insanity, which whittles away the mysterious fear factor very quickly.\n- The story is just dull. There is some possibility in the beginning that it might go in a certain, disturbing direction based on the narrative given, but it turns out to be pretty boring and a bit nonsensical. The characters just aren't very interesting. You don't really care very much.\n\nFor the money you pay, I really can't recommend this one. If you must, buy the steam code for it on 99Gamers for cheap, instead of throwing $22 out for it.","April 12, 2015","false","4.8"," 176 of 226 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","176","226","6","0"

It only took about 10 minutes to crush that optimism.\n\nThe supposed sequel to The Dark Descent casts you as a Victorian-era inventor and industrialist, wandering his home in search of his rather ghostly little boys. The chase leads him into the sprawling factory complex he designed for automating the butchering of pigs. Now, Victorian horror is a rich vein to mine, and the setting of a mechanized slaughterhouse really can't be beat. So I hope you can understand the crushing disappointment that comes with seeing this setup wasted. In my first 90-minute session, nothing happened. Nothing. I wandered my mansion, I turned on some machines, I wandered a factory, I changed some fuses, I wandered outside, I turned on a truck, I quit. At no point did I encounter an enemy or anything even remotely threatening.\n\nWhat I did encounter was a lot of poorly-paced jumpscares in the form of loud noises out of the blue and glimpses of scurrying NPCs. Understand that the original Amnesia did the same thing, but with a much better sense of moderation and coupled with an exceptionally strong sound design. A Machine for Pigs completely fails to build the same atmosphere, trading the mysterious whisperings and footsteps of the castle for the playful requests of ghost children (who basically exist to point you to your next objective) and awkward monologues recounting past events. Gone is the sanity system or the balancing of light and dark, along with the entire inventory system as well. You have an infinite lantern at your disposal, which you will need because the lighting in this game is a bit wonky, what with wall lamps and candles failing to cast any significant illumination. Hilariously, the game still uses the obnoxious visual sanity effects without the system... it just hits you with them at scripted points.\n\nI was hoping there was an interesting story here, but the central theme is mangled worse than the creatures you catch fleeting glimpses of. The monologues and notes are disjointed and mostly unrelated. The attempt to write in Victorian styles also does more harm than good, making some notes near incomprehensible. In the end, there's none of the magic of Amnesia here at all. The atmosphere is botched, there's almost nothing to interact with and no reason to search the environment, and the story is nonsensical and poorly conveyed. I was certain there was no way A Machine for Pigs could be such a step down, but my goodness was I wrong.","September 16, 2015","false","1.3"," 148 of 193 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","148","193","4","0"

If you are looking for a survival horror game, there isn't really any "survival" or not even that much "horror" or "game" in this one. The first 90 minutes of this game are frightning as heck, but once you have encountered a few enemies and discovered that they aren't really much of a threat at all, the scary part is over. No feeling of being hunted, no brilliant AI, no mazes, no proper puzzles, no physics or interactivity etc, just a linear path.\n\nHowever, having cleared that out of the way I'm still giving this one thumbs up. Amnesia 2 is about the atmosphere and sense of mystery. Players expecting a challenge or interesting game mechanics are going to be deeply disappointed, but those seeking a good twisted story will get some moderately creepy and disturbing experience. This story has so many levels that it would require an entire book or something to go through all the possible theories. Some claim that despite the effort put into the writing, the plot isn't really that great or sophisticated either, but although it does has some problems, I think it does at least occasionally succeed. From story or atmosphere viewpoint Amnesia 2 is still an average game and if that's your thing, I recommend it.\n\n- 4 hours put into the game, 8 hours put into arguing (speculating) about what the story of Machine for Pigs is about","November 28, 2013","true","4.6"," 265 of 371 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","265","371","0","1"

Theres no need to hide and you can easily run by then in your few encounters.\n- Machine for pigs did nothing to build on the original and instead decided against all of the aspects that made it great, theres no survival or fear for your life.\n- Apart from the very early stages theres barely an ounce of genuine tension. As you went further down this worsened.\n- I suffered like many others with random lag when the talking scenes occured which really ruined any immersion I had, especially towards the terrible ending.\n\nVERDICT?\nThis game offers the biggest deterioration from start to finish I have ever seen and it results in being a boring experience.","May 3, 2015","false","7.1"," 124 of 161 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","124","161","7","0"

No horror game excels Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs in those regards.\n\nNote to anyone who has played Amnesia: The Dark Descent:\n\nPlease do not take this game as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. What many people do wrong with this game is that they go with the mindset of the previous Amnesia - going for the horror.\n\nNow, I'm not saying it's wrong to play horror games for the horror in them, and it definitely is not a surprise why people think of this as a sequel, what with the blaring "Amnesia" in the name. However, while the game does make an occasional reference to the original, it's significantly better to think of this as a stand-alone game.\n\nAmnesia: The Dark Descent was made by Frictional Games. They have made a name for themselves by bringing back the horror in the horror genre. Their games have that creeping atmosphere that you can never be rid of. From Penumbra: Black Plague onwards, they took a theme of defenselessness, which definitely has been a big asset.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs was made by The Chinese Room. When Frictional Games thought about making a sequel to the Amnesia series, they decided to have an other company make it instead. Being impressed by Dear Esther, they approached The Chinese Room for sharing similar mindsets in their game development. Frictional Games did not want The Chinese Room to make a game that is similar to the original, they wanted them to make a game in their own way.\n\nTwo different companies make a game of the same world, with the same theme.

Most angry MANPIGS are running along on scaffolding above or below you, and are mostly used as set dressing. As you move deeper into the game (especially if you're following the journals & notes) you'll realize you've reached a point where finding MANPIGS wouldn't make sense - and as such you don't. However, the game keeps up with it's eerie sound effects and music queues to a myriad of empty rooms & squandered settings. This retroactively negates the creepiness of the same queues you've been hearing all game.\n\nAlso, the only times I was genuinely scared were from "jump scares", that seemed mostly out of place "AHHH! THE FLOOR COLLAPSED!" or "AHHH! I SEEM TO HAVE BEEN TELEPORTED TO A RANDOM MAZE INCONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE GAME'S TONE".\n\nIf you're looking for a weird story, I would advise you to check this game out.

It can still potentially spoil the game's beginning to some degree, I guess. Therefore I put it in spoiler tags; you might want to skip it if you're planning to play the game sometime.\n\n\nMonster encounters are not only rare, the lamp also begins to flicker everytime a monster is near - usually long before it can even be seen. After noticing this the game entirely lost the little tension it had to begin with for me: I always knew when a monster would appear beforehand, when they appeared they rarely posed a danger because of their scripted nature and for whatever reason the effects directly looking at a monster had in Penumbra and TDD are gone as well (or at least toned done a lot), so the horrors that were quiet effectively left to the player's imagination in the predecessors are now shown directly, thus making the game less scary in the end.\n\nSo, to sum it up: there is not much actual gameplay in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, it is hardly a game at all.\nThat doesn't necessarily has to be a bad thing. The same thing can probably be said about Telltale's The Walking Dead, but TWD makes up its lack of gameplay with a very well told story.\nHowever AMfP isn't very good storywise either: It's full of horror-pulp stereotypes, making it very predictable, and towards the end the story gets completely lost in a pile of pretentious symbolism.\n\nNot much is missed by skipping AMfP completely. If you liked TDD and haven't played the Penumbra games, better go for them instead - they are a lot better than this new game.\nAlso note that AMfP was not developed by Frictional Games (who made Penumbra and TDD) but by The Chinese Room who apparently moved towards making console games by now (figures). So waiting for Frictional's game SOMA, which is currently in devolpment, could still be worthwile if it turns out closer to the games they made themselves.","November 25, 2013","false","4.5"," 432 of 661 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","432","661","0","18"

The story is interesting, and the settings are well-designed (and certainly more visually interesting than the dull castle of The Dark Descent). If it was just called "A Machine for Pigs", I would have no problem giving it a positive review.\n\nThe problem is that it's not called A Machine for Pigs; it's called Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, and so the developers are actively encouraging me to review it as an Amnesia game because that's what they're pitching it as to the customer. And in that regard, it's kind of awful. It's important to understand that this game was developed primarily by The Chinese Room, the developers of Dear Esther (which was an interesting story-based exploration game with gameplay summarized as a walking simulator), and not Frictional Games, the creator of the Penumbra and Amnesia games. I've already made it known that I consider Amnesia to be a worse game than the Penumbra series, and this game just takes it a step further down. The worst parts of Amnesia are well in-tact, so you can fully expect to frequently get wobbly vision during setpieces and to constantly get slowed down and visually impaired while the narrator dishes out a bit of story, which consistently kills both the pacing and the atmosphere. But everything else seems to be fair game for the cutting board, since there's no longer a sanity system, you don't have to manage resources like fuel for your light, and you don't even have an inventory. There isn't a puzzle in the game any more complex than "put the coal into the coal chute ten steps away" or "pull the lever", which makes it hard to say that there are even puzzles in the game at all. Enemies are almost nonexistant, with the grand total of actual enemy encounters being about 6, and being generous, taking up about 3 minutes of the 3 or 4 hours it takes to complete the game. They're not even particularly good or long encounters, either; in one particular instance, you suddenly drop into an area with an invisible water monster (which was more or less shamelessly ripped from The Dark Descent in place of actually making something new, with only a single note giving a half-hearted explanation of why it exists in this game), all you have to do is run forward in the only other direction that isn't towards the water monster. The path to the ladder to escape is literally gated by siderails, so it's almost impossible to actually fail the segment. And that sentiment applies to all of the game's sparse encounters; each of them is a very scripted, very setpiece-like instance where the monster shows up, you hide in the designated hiding place, the monster walks by, and you continue your merry way. It's very safe and guided, and you never really get the feeling of being in any real danger. The game does a lot to try to build up atmosphere, but it falls flat after the first thirty minutes or so because you very quickly realize that the game is never actually going to pay off on the tension beyond quick fleeting glimpses of a monster or a sudden banging noise that has no purpose other than to try to get a jump out of you (which makes up about 2/3 of the game's "scares").\n\nUltimately I would still recommend this game at a heavy discount, since all things considered it's still not the worst horror game on Steam (though that isn't saying a whole lot, considering thanks to Steam Greenlight even Bad Rats is no longer the worst game on Steam) and it does have an interesting plot, but if you're looking for more of what you've come to expect from Frictional Games then either wait for SOMA or download Penumbra: Necrologue.","June 21, 2015","true","4.1"," 55 of 73 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","55","73","4","2"

This game is such a dissapointment.\nIf ''The Chinese Room'' didnt get involved this could've been so much better.\nThey didnt try to make Amnesia 2, they tried to make a sequel to Dear Esther.\n\nI loved the story in TDD, it had the perfect balance between gameplay and story. This one is more focused on the story but I couldn't really get into it because it's so effin boring. There was not a single scary moment in this game and the 'monsters' you'll face later on are no threat to you and you can just casually walk past them. Your character is never in any actual danger. You couldn't check your sanity; tinderboxes and oil didn't exist. You don't have an inventory so don't even bother exploring. But why mention it? You can't do that anyway since every door in this game is locked unless you have to actually go through it. If you loved grabbing random sh*t in TDD and throwing it at the enemy or just against a wall - you can't do it in this one cause everything is locked in place.\nThe nerve wrecking atmosphere from TDD is completey lost, you don't have to worry about oil for your lantern cause it is unlimited.\n\nI quit the game 3 times but I kept giving it a chance because I WANTED it to be good but there is really no hope for this.

The IP was handed off to a developer team called THE CHINESE ROOM. THE CHINESE ROOM are the\nones responsible for creating this game and FRICTIONAL GAMES, was only involved in PUBLSHING (NOT CREATING)\nbut publishing this game. The Chinese Room are also the author's of the narrative driven game Dear Esther.\n\nSo in short, AAMFP is a game that is highly different than it's predecessor TDD(The Dark Descent.)\n\nLet's do a quick run through of Pros vs Cons.\n\nPros:\n-Good Atmosphere\n-Good Story\n-Good Graphics\n\nCons:\n-Not as frightful\n-Easier Puzzles\n-The Tension that builds early is quickly lost.\n\nThe game itself is narrative driven, more so than the original Amnesia. The story presented in AAMFP is told and built quite well and solid in my opinion. It all led up to a more than predictable climatic ending however. The main difference I noticed between AAMFP and TDD is that often I found myself rushing through AAMFP content at times looking for the next scare/enemy interraction. There is significantly less interraction with enemies in AAMFP which in turn leads to long peroids of time where you're either exploring or solving mediocre puzzles such as changing a bulb, or turning a valve. It is during these extended periods that the fear and immersive dread that was originally built up is lost. However, I still found the encounters with the enemies to be tense at times.\n\nOverall I feel that this game is worth it's retail value, I enjoyed it, I got a good imersion/scare out of playing it and the only real way to know how good this game is is to pick it up and give it a playthrough. As long as you're not expecting a Amnesia The Dark Descent v.2 I believe any true horror genre fan will enjoy this title.","October 14, 2015","true","10.8"," 38 of 50 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","38","50","2","0"

STOP THRUSTING IT IN MY FACE LIKE AN ERECT ♥♥♥♥\n2) No more physics. One fun thing to do in the original was too ♥♥♥♥ around with the physics. They weren't amazing but were still fun. In this game it's a bit different, you cant interact with almost any new objects, and even some of the old objects have had physics removed.\n3) Sanity effects and inventory removed. Another appeal of the original was the sanity system. While not perfect the sanity system had some fun elements that could make the game much scarier at times. And the inventory system could to if you ever ran out of tinderboxes or oil at a bad moment. Not here! You instead get a lantern which occasionaly flickers.Brilliant\n4)The monsters weren't scary. While i was playing at the beginning, I was ♥♥♥♥ing terrified of the horrors that hid within the mansions. Then I eventually got to the first encounter, and lo and behold the monster didn't scare or frighten me.In fact the stupid prick didn't even notice me, he saw my charecter flailing his Lantern like an idiot, and walked right past me.

The only time I felt like i was in actual danger was suring the bit you had to run through the town, while a pig frantically chased you trying to get a autograph.\n5) The water part.

If there is one thing that we can learn from this narrative, it is that wordy and intelligent are not synonyms.  It brushes against interesting themes, but does not reach any conclusion worth noting, aside from the classic video game trope that "evil is bad."  The few encounters with enemy creatures devolve from an intial tense atmosphere to an annoyance, as the player realizes they can always outrun their opponent, and will never be challenged with completing a task while an enemy is present.  Heaven forbid you stumble on one of the half-dozen safe points from which you can view the underwhelming models of the creatures you have been running from.  In the final hour, there is a two-part boss battle which is mind-boggling in both concept and execution, and clashes harshly with the game's established world.  Then you get on the pork shuttle to watch the game play the final act through on its own - though why the final scene concludes the game as the protagonist wishes is not obvious to me.  This is not a technically challenging horror game, and it is not an intellectually challenging narrative adventure.

Unfortunately, that's not exactly easy to do. For one thing, it carries the "Amnesia" title, which sets certain expectations. Also, releasing so close to a similar genre game like Outlast doesn't help either. A Machine for Pigs is nothing like either of those games - it is very much its own beast (no pun intended).\n\nGameplay-wise, it resembles the original Amnesia, in that you explore a creepy location with nothing but the light of a lantern to aid you. The stories of the two games are also connected. But that's pretty much where the similarities end. In the original game, you had to manage resources to keep your light lit (and your character sane), which ended up being a pretty tense balancing act at times. Additionally, running and hiding from monsters was a key gameplay element. However, in AMFP, your lantern never runs out of fuel, the actual monster encounters are few and far between, and hiding is not usually necessary.\n\nThe upshot of these changes make AMFP a very different feeling game. For one, it is not particularly scary. Sure, there are definitely lots of moments of dread where you find yourself not wanting to go through a door or down a dark hallway. However, you soon realize that in most cases, there is actually nothing there to fear. Secondly, the game is very linear and the puzzles are overly simple. Mostly, you just go through a series of corridors and turn on a valve here and there, which opens up the next corridor. It's pretty easy. So this isn't really a horror game in the sense of "scare factor". The horror mostly comes from the feelings created by the environment (level and sound design, which are both excellent), and the story. The story is the high point here, though. Most of it is revealed through notes and audio recordings that are found throughout the levels. The voiceovers, and the writing especially, are very good.\n\nI would say that is the main reason to play this game - the story and atmosphere. As a pure horror/scare-factor game, you will be disappointed. For that, you are better off playing the original Amnesia or genre newcomer Outlast. A Machine for Pigs plays much more like a horror version of Dear Esther (which should come as no surprise, as it was developed by the same people). If that sounds up your alley, definitely give this one a go. Just keep in mind it's not really very scary or action oriented, so if you are expecting a repeat of the original game (or something along the lines of Outlast), you will be severely disappointed. Playtime is around 4 hours or so, give or take. All in all, I felt it was a worthy successor to the Amnesia legacy, in its own way. Probably not as good a game overall, but definitely a unique experience that is worth checking out at some point if you enjoyed the original.","September 22, 2013","true","5.2"," 53 of 84 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","53","84","0","3"

However, that in no way lessens the experience for the gamer or sullies the franchise as is often the case when outside development houses take over in subsequent sequels. In fact by the time the end credits roll on A Machine for Pigs, The Chinese Room have taken you to a far more menacing and psychologicaly darker place than the original Amnesia could have ever have conjured up.\n\nMy main gripe with the original Amnesia was that, whilst utterly terrifying in its first half, its second half was plodded and padded out with puzzles there simply to exist to lengthen the adventure. When it all began to fall back on the familiar supernatural tropes so often trotted out in horror I was left slightly disappointed. The Chinese Room seem to have understood this perfectly, especially when it comes to horror. By toning down the puzzles (there is no inventory to speak of) you end up not being taken out of the horror every five minutes to solve some mind-bending puzzle as was the case in the first one. By removing the need for oil and the sanity meter they have streamlined the experience further which in the end allows the story to move to the forefront. The Chinese Room also seem to understand perfectly that horror and tension can only be sustained for short periods. This was my gripe with both the first Amnesia and Outlast in that they should have been shorter in order to sustain the terror they were trying to convey. Brevity is the golden rule in my books when it comes to horror and any horror game outstaying its welcome in length ends up being a diminished experience. A Machine for Pigs comes in at a pert 4-6 hrs (depending on how you play) and that is the perfect length in my books for a horror title.\n\nA Machine for Pigs is set at the end of the Industrial Era (which the game evokes beautifully) and sees you take control of Oswald Mandus, a rather imposing giant of industry, awaking to a terrifying personal nightmare. Emerging from a hellish fever dream that involves some kind of infernal industrial machine, he soon realizes that both of his children are missing. Once again, like the first, notes lay strewn about the game world that give us insight into his back story. Oswald, you see, is the proud owner of a meat processing factory but as the tale descends into its serpentine labyrinth of terror you soon realize that this is a factory where very little governance seems to have been applied when it comes to the kind of meat being processed for consumption.\n\nWhilst slow going to begin with - the second half of the game really literally picks up and moves at a cracking pace which never seems to let up for one single second as it hurtles towards its grim ending. I was initially a bit disappointed with it but as time marched on I found myself more and more invested in this tale of horror than I was with the initial Amnesia. At the end of it all, all I can say was that I was suitably impressed with this title and if The Chinese Room is drafted in at some stage to make another I can't say I will be disappointed.\n\nIf you enjoy horror there is no reason you should not enjoy this. Machine for Pigs is a far darker, more complex (in terms of the tale its trying to tell) and sinister game experience than the first one and if you go in not expecting a rehash of the first game you are bound to be in for a pleasantly spooky surprise.","April 22, 2014","true","6.4"," 160 of 277 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","160","277","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kamfeth/recommended/239200/","Kamfeth","Kamfeth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kamfeth/","316 products in account","Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs - The second main game from Amnesia series. After the amazing Amnesia: The Dark Descent people wanted next Amnesia, much better than first game, but is it really better? I won't anwer that question, I'll just say that it's "Different", but mostly in positive aspects.\n\nFirst you have to remember that this game wasn't created by Frictional Games like first Amnesia. It was created by The Chinese Room (You can know them if you've played Dear Esther). Ok, but let's talk about the game!\n\nMost of the players didn't like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, because a few important aspects from Amnesia: The Dark Descent were cut off in this game. There wasn't any inventory, you couldn't pick up many items like chairs, boxes etc, no tinderbox to pick up and your source of light is unlimited. So the survival aspect of the game don't exist. The only items you can pickup are letters, papers and important items that you have to pickup to move on with story.\n\nMonsters aren't that scary like in first game, but still i have to say that power of imagination in that game still works! I was scared because of simply noises and i thought there is monster nearby. Also i should note that there aren't the "warning alert" when the monster is next to you. That alert was in first Amnesia and in my opinion it's better that it's don't exist here, because if you won't be careful you can me surprised in "negative" aspect of course! Don't get me wrong, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is still very scary game, but you can't compare it to the first game.\n\nSoundtrack is amazing! It was composed by Jessica Curry (Same artist like in Dear Esther). The style is again different than from the first game, but it's also amazing and it's fit with all those factory levels and London from fall of XIX century. Go ahead and try it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkVvNMuJsA\n\nYou could thought that i already said the most important things from that game, but nope, not yet! Now is The Story\n\nThe story in this game... I can't describe it, if i'll say it's amazing it's not enough. In this aspect Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs owning the first game, no doubt about it! It's very emotional, sad and you'll think about it after you'll finish the whole game. I won't say any spoilers, but to make you curious i'll just say that the "Pigs" in the title of the game is an ambiguous word... In my opinion one of the best stories i've ever been seeing in video games. You should play this game even only because of that story. Also i recommend read all the notes that you'll find in the game from the chronological order after you'll finish the game.\n\nI'm really sad seeing all those negative reviews, most of these people were just looking for Amnesia: The Dark Descent 2, but I really understand them. I was also a little bit dissapointed when i realised i couldn't take chairs and other objects and throw them away, honestly I don't understand why developers removed that, but when i finished the game I was glad i pre-ordered it.\n\nI rate this game 8/10 (Very Good), mostly because of that great story, soundtrack and the whole atmosphere. It isn't that scary like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, so if you're looking for only scary horror game and you don't care about other aspects, then you should buy other game. My english isn't perfect so I apologise for any grammar mistakes, I hope i'll be better in future!","January 8, 2015","true","9.2"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

Not necessarily, but then Dark Descent was such an unexpectedly delirious and exhilerating experience. It was a surprise. The difference with its sequel is that people have been expecting A Machine For Pigs for a while; based on those expectations, some were disappointed.\n\nI was not. A Machine For Pigs doesn't need to be as scary as Dark Descent. Of course there are plenty of moments in that game which made my blood run cold, such as the infamous chase through the flooded Archives with a monster snapping at your heels, the damned Prison area which gave me plenty of mini heartattacks, and just the growl of those disgusting monsters. Yet I remember only a few moments from that game, which to me are not as important as the overall experience. What was the most scary for me was actually the story, and learning about Daniel. At the beginning, he's a man that drank the Amnesia potion to make himself forget the horrors the Baron had inflicted. But of course, as we descend deeper into Brennenberg, we realize the truth. Near the end, I wasn't even sure Daniel deserved to be saved (which is why the three different endings pleased me so much).\n\nA Machine For Pigs has a story that is just as good, and in some respects, better than Dark Descent. It has its moments too, but A Machine For Pigs is all about how it leaves you feeling than the individual moments you can remember. The core element of discovering the story through notes, and the journal entries of Oswald, is still there. We learn he's a drunkard (wine is, after all, its own form of Amnesia). We learn he's a butcher. We learn he wants to be more effective at butchering through the use of technology. We learn his wife died in childbirth, which clearly has a bad affect on his sanity (like a true madman, he wants mmotality, and creates a machine to that effect). He apparently wants to save his children, and is guided by a vaguely familiar and sinister voice over the scattered telephones. His journal entries are distrubing enough, littered with contempt, hatred, anger, dispair, and revolting descriptions, all which offer a glimpse into his deranged mind.\n\nYou really need to appreciate the briliance of this, along with the other core elements that made Dark Descent amazing, which A Machine For Pigs definitely has: the sound, the constant oppressive and immersive atmosphere, the music, the voice acting, and the mystery. Despite the tension which keeps you constantly on edge, you want to keep exploring the machine. You feel compelled to descend further down, past the scraping metal, the wails of steam, the screams and groans of the machinery, the flickering lights, the thick, putrid smell as its often described, the pulsing of the engines-A Machine For Pigs does a fantastic job of creating the setting. The fact that I felt no relief when I was briefly outside is also a testament to that accomplishment. The rain slicked and gloomy London streets offered no breath of fresh air.\n\nA Machine For Pigs is memorable for its hauntingly beautiful settings. Now, one of my complaints is that there is not really a sense of urgency. That's practically a requirement given the premise, but unlike the constant fear of having the Shadow chase you in Dark Descent, A Machine For Pigs takes its time delivering on the scares. To be sure, there are scares to be had, and there are a few jumpscares right from the very beginning. The urgency comes in bursts, mostly from being chased by the grotesque pig-men. The puzzles are mostly unnecessary (like the Sanity meter in Dark Descent, which did little more than blur the screen) and mostly frustrating.\n\nInterestingly, while I was playing, I couldn't stop thinking of Pink Floyd's video for Another Brick In The Wall. That's totally a good thing! I also couldn't shake the eeriness, the dread. The disgust, eventually, because just as I felt ultimately repulsed by Daniel, Oswald proved to surpass even Daniel's selfishness and brutality. That's why A Machine For Pigs is so good, in my opinion: the sum of its parts is an experience worth your time and careful attention.\n\nThe blood splattered walls of the factory where the pigs are slaughtered take on an even more vile nature when you read Oswald's diary because his descriptions of people, often as "swine," sends chills down your spine. Pigs are closest to humans, biologically speaking. And Oswald's pursuit of fortune, and of leaving a legacy which survives flesh and bone is accomplished without scruples and through ruthlessness which makes Daniel seem like a saint. His creation is the machine, and the setting of Industrial Revolution era London, with all of its distinct British cruelty, child labour, capitalism, and new technology is simply perfect to tell a story that is fundamentally about greed. And the bloody path we carve to sate it.\n\nAnd there are scares. Some require a bit more thinking and putting the pieces together, some require running away and hiding, some can make you yell and flinch away from the screen. It's good we don't have to gather oil for the lantern (it runs on electricity now, anyway) or that we need to gather an inventory because I think in this context, it would become tedious. Instead, we can focus on the atmosphere, story, and the scares. We can get lost in the growls and squeals, the heavy, incessant labours of the machine, and simply unravel the insanity within.\n\nSo is A Machine For Pigs scary, all in all? That depends on your definition of scary; it will scare you when and where it's supposed to, in a heart pounding, sweaty hands sort of way. Think of it as a rush, a wave of fear that crashes into you, whereas Dark Descent was a constant flood.\n\nYet instead of comparison, we should enjoy A Machine For Pigs rather as its own unique, interesting, and dark vision of human nature. So I think the real question should be: is A Machine For Pigs horrifying? And the answer is absolutely. That is the point, after all.\n\n\nTruly, I am not a fan of horror. I was intrigued by Dark Descent because my friends wouldn't shut up about it, with good reason. Dark Descent became the game which urged me to consider some other ones, and Dark Descent quickly became my favourite horror game, with Outlast being a very close second. I've found that the genre is deeply rooted in all the sorts of sad, brutal, sick and twisted ways humans strip away their humanity (usually by trying to become more than what we are; most of the time, the sacrifices aren't worth it). This game is no exception.\n\nA Machine For Pigs is certainly deserving of sharing the same panicked breath with Dark Descent.","December 26, 2015","true","8.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/princeofbees/recommended/239200/","princeofbees","Byrd Whyrm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/princeofbees/","274 products in account","I found A Machine for Pigs to be much more horrifying than The Dark Descent, but less terrifying. What I mean by this is that there are substantially fewer moments of white-knuckled terror than in the first Amnesia. Instead, the game is much more about creeping dread and repulsion as the story unfolds. It is a much more focused game, and I have read that the linearity and lack of interaction disappointed a lot of players. I, however, did not mind. In The Dark Descent, very little of what could be interacted with served any purpose, and removing this freedom to interact with useless objects did not bother me. The linearity did not bother me either, because the story was compelling enough to keep me wanting to progress onwards.\nIf what you liked about the first Amnesia was primarily the moment to moment scares, I am hesitant to recommend this game to you, as you may find it disappointing. I would recommend Outlast instead, which has a laughably bad story but excellent atmosphere and scares. If you loved Amnesia due to the Poe-esque or Lovecraftian horror story behind the scares, and the repulsion as you discover what the protagonist has done, then you will most likely love this game. Personally, I found this game to be a superior experience to The Dark Descent, and this is not a statement I make lightly.","December 20, 2013","true","16.9"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","1"

You will likely laud it, or hate it.  If you have to look up the word 'laud' in the dictionary, you should probably pass, (or better yet, buy the game and start the processes of understanding nuanced and subtle literature)\n\nYou will probaby enjoy this game if\n- you appreciate enviormental atmosphere\n- you enjoy literature\n- you like horror that builds more on deep issues and less on 'shock' or 'camp' gimmicks\n- you like Dear Esther\n- you want to support developers that are pushing the boundaries on games as a literary medium\n- you enjoy a game with puzzles that feel 'real-world' and don't call attention to themselves or hinder the pace of the\nnarrative\n\nYou will probably not enjoy this game if\n- you don't like not having a gun in your video games\n- you don't enjoy having to do your own critical thinking to come to conclusions concening the story or how it ends\n- you think it will be very similary to The Dark Descent (the game feels much closer to Dear Esther in my opinion)\n- you want something with puzzles that requires you to scratch your nogging\n- you want a horror game where things jump out at you often\n\nIn short, if you value deep narrative experiences in games, and feel familiar with literature and coming to terms with your own underlying meaning, you will find an absolutely matchless gem here.

Either way, consider this tale a gothic horror tale in the traditional sense, as anyone familiar with the novels Frankenstein or Dracula could tell you, the 'horror' is less about bloodshed or constantly spooking you, and more about building a sense of dread over the whole canvas.","July 4, 2014","true","13.7"," 71 of 121 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","71","121","0","2"

People literally drown it in pig♥♥♥♥ while other really crappy titles manage to get away. Often the reason why players hate AMFP is that they beleive it's far worse than the original Amnesia. I suggest you should consider these two as completely different games. The Chinese Room (the developer I put highest hopes on and will defend) did their thing. OK, they got rid of core Amnesia gameplay elements (lantern oil, thunderboxes), but I think they did it for the good sake of the story. For story and atmosphere are the basis for Machine For Pigs. Storytelling is just plain dark, almost pitch-black and somewhat Lovecraft-ish as it's predecessor. Game is sophisticated as it is asks global and complex existential questions. Ominous atmosphere is here allright, driven by classy frightening sound desing and music. And YES, this Amnesia is scary - not too scary, but still.. Although it's hard to terrify a Survival Horror vet like me, AAMFP did that. And this what I ♥♥♥♥in' expect from a horror game! Ain't no need to throw ♥♥♥♥ at gamer's face, more of that - no need to drop them off their seats. Freeze them on the spot so they are afraid to move a finger! That's the real horror. And here's the thing some will consider DarkDescent-blasphemy: maybe removing oil tanks, thunderboxes and difficult puzzles was necessary for this particular project, like blinding a man makes his hearing sharper. Cutting the gameplay elements allowed story and setting take the spotlight. IMHO it's better than solving riddle after riddle after riddle in similar tunnels in Penumbra: Overture. Amnesia AMFP isn't an interactive movie though - you do things besides walking. I will however admit it lacks some hard puzzles. And dying. Yeah, I dropped dead TWO (!) TIMES. Anyway, it helped me to percieve the story better. Game's not short too - if you take time and won't charge your ♥♥♥ forward you'll get your healthy 8 hours as I did. To summerize, game's great, all I've expected from the sequel. Dark Descent fans should give it a fair chance, I think. Bare bones of the franchise, huh? Hell of a skeleton then.

That's not to say there isn't any, but much less than Dark Descent.   AMFP goes for it's horror in it's atmosphere and writing, letting your imagination paint the disturbing pictures of what our character has experienced.\n\nSince so much of AMFP story and horror is fleshed out in reading notes it doesn't surprise me that people are giving it so much hate.  It took me 6 hours to finish the game without getting stuck too long on any "puzzle", so when I see people claiming to "beat" it under 3-4 hours it's no wonder they aren't enjoying it.  I'd wager they speed run through every area and don't bother reading any journal entries.

In Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs they removed all resource management, your lantern will never run out and nothing can be found in the environment to aid you. The developers where likely looking to streamline your experience so as to allow for more focus on the plot and the game world but sadly this had a hugely adverse effect for me. I found that without any inventory or items you really lacked a reason to search the environment. A new room was really just a new hallway in the wax museum instead of a place to explore. That sounds harsh, but I just lost motivation to take my time and look around.\n\nPuzzles, puzzles were a large part of the earlier title but again they were practically removed. It can be said that the puzzles in  Amnesia #1 had about the depth of Doom 1 puzzles. By this I mean you entered an area were confronted by a door (or mechanism) preventing you from proceeding, the only way to get passed was to find the key. The key was the sole collectable item in that area so it caused no brainpower besides finding it and inserting it into the door. Yes there are a couple puzzles in Amnesia that had a bit more depth but for the most part they were about on par with Math Circus. So why tone them down? Again they wanted to streamline  the game, make it more accessible and focus more on the plot. Good or bad that's mostly up to the player but since we are talking about video games here the gameplay should stand up for itself a bit, hopefully.\n\nIs it scary? that's honestly the biggest question most people are going to have. The answer is yes, sort of. Its scary but not as tense or even jump scare happy as the other title. Its environments are definitely chilling and there are a few scary encounters but to be honest you really only have to deal with enemies 5 or 6 times throughout the game. Pretty much every time you see an enemy it’s a G-man encounter, if you haven't played half-life that’s to say that it’s a scripted event where an enemy shows up, startles you and then leaves the area. In the rare occasion where there is a patrolling enemy you can you just turn off your lantern and crouch away from him.\n\nSo why did I give this game a recommend. Well its defiantly not for everyone, but this game does have a bunch of things going for it. The environments are terrific. The early 20th century factories and mechanisms are truly creepy and an awesome setting for a game. The atmosphere as a whole is well done. Plot is given to you through letters and diary entrees left about, as well as phone calls(kinda) from a reoccurring character. I found the ending to Amnesia #1 to be a letdown, this game did a bit better with the conclusion I thought.\n\nSo if you are a fan of the first person survival horror genre or Amnesia #1 and want a more streamlined game focused on narrative. Then Amnesia  a Machine for Pigs is right for you. Otherwise you might want to consider waiting for the next game by the original devs. Either way this game is still a decent play though for $15\n\nIf you don’t like the sound of a gameplay lacking survival horror game I would strongly advise checking out Penumbra: Black Plague. Its currently only $5 on steam and is in my opinion the best fps survival horror game out there.","December 21, 2013","true","4.6"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

At the same time, the horror element is somewhat less agravating than in the original installment, which might turn some of the original fans away. I for one was slighty disappointed at first, but steadily got to love the game for its uniqueness.\nThe gameplay is biased towards telling a story, rather than scare the player as was the case with the first game. Thus, there are fewer environmental interractions (aka clicking on objects) and the grueling randomness of the monsters in the first game were replaced with scripted and, most times, less difficult encounters. Furthermore, the overall time needed to finish the game is somewhere at half of the original Amnesia (not taking into account exploring and searching for certain lore items like letters and notes).\nIn conclusion, I can recommend Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs to most players looking for a solid story, intertwined with decent gameplay mechanics as well as a dark and gruesome, yet exceptional envinronment design.","October 11, 2014","true","6.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

But too many people evaluate A Machine for Pigs on the standard of how similar it is to its predecessor, too afraid to look at it on its own merits. Indeed, there are fewer gameplay elements, such as an infinite lamp duration, easier/fewer puzzles, and an overall lower danger level. But what AMFP has, it does spectacularly. The Chinese Room took a more story-heavy approach and crafted the world around how it's told, and it's a tale well worth hearing. The environments are beautifully constructed, the voicework fits the characters perfectly, and Jessica Curry's music is spectacular. It's like a roller coaster: just because you're not pushing the carts yourself doesn't mean it's not a enjoyable, thrilling ride.\n\nPeople looking for a game that will leave them petrified with fear will be more at home with The Dark Descent.

While I have a sneaking suspicion this may have been due to a large outcry of people 'running out' of light sources in the first game, it might have just been a design choice, who knows. But I do feel that a lot of the tension is removed along with these systems, which is damn a shame.\n\nThe puzzles also suffer due to the lack of an inventory, restricted generally to an immediate component search to fix whatever machine has broken down. At no point is there any real challenge, unlike the first game which I remember had me stumped on at least a couple.\n\nThe use of monsters has also been peeled back in a way. They will run by as means of scaring you initially, later on they serve more to illustrate certain story points. It is actually rather rare to be put in any direct confrontations in this game, and  even rarer that any amount of stealth or hide-and-seek is required. This is the biggest dissapointing aspect for me, as hiding from the monsters in DD was much more pants-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scary than just running away from the scripted manpig sequences.\n\nOne thing I think the game improves on is mindgames. I can't be certain, but I'm pretty sure that sometimes an areas makeup, (such as doors or other props) have shifted around (then again, it could have been all in my head, but if so, you can chalk that up to the palpable atmosphere). An early revelation in the mansion is also particularly effective in putting you in the paranoid frame of mind of the protagonist Mandus. Some other unique scares or tricks the game throws at you really helps to mix it up and distinguish it from dark descent.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting, and some of the notes are rather disturbing, or striking, especially with Mandus's own twisted vision of mankind. However don't expect anything spelled out for you, or for there to be some great revelation.\n\nOverall I'd say that the game is well made, if a little dissapointing. Certainly if you enjoyed Amnesia DD, Dear Esther, or even both, you'll definitely find something here. If you hated one or the other, then probably not ;)","September 20, 2013","true","5.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Now, into the review. This is a first person linear horror game made by the Chinese Room, and their signatures are all over this game.\n\nThe game is beautifully written, every document fascinating, every bit of dialogue engaging. This game masters immersion, and it simply makes sense. This is not a leap at you horror, it is not jumpscare based, it is not overly gorey (not at first anyway), and it is not overly forward with it's horror. It is more conceptual, and a good amount of the horror is lost to all those who rush through the game without reading the documents. This game makes me think of a lot of eastern horror games, less am onster in your face and more one breathing down your throat, as if the very world was against you. The factory is well crafted, the story is superb, the atmosphere coats you like a blanket and tries to suffocate you in fear. I honestly found this game more scary than A:TTD, and I even played through a second time to find stuff I did not see before.\n\nI do admit, this game is not without it's flaws.  The puzzles of A:TDD are heavily reduced. The puzzles here are straightforward without a lot of wandering about. To me this is great. It makes it a little closer to an interactive novel, but the puzzles of A:TDD mostly just took me out of the game. A:TDD was closer to those old point and click games where you used everything against everything else and got a bit frustrated, removing all the horror. This game has nothing of that, so the fear is able to sink in. It is very "Chinese Room"-y to focus less on the gameplay and more on the story aspects (the world and whatnot). For a more extensive review, here's a link.\n\nAmnesia:AMFP Review[xshadowsaurgaming.wordpress.com]\n\nAll in all I love this game, but I understand the fact it has a limited audience. If you enjoy horror, great story telling, the chinese room, or you're even mildly interested and willing to explore I'd say pick it up. I don't regret ♥♥♥♥♥ing it and I'm certain I'm far from done with it.","May 28, 2014","true","16.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twirkkhu/recommended/239200/","Twirkkhu","Twirkkhu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twirkkhu/","131 products in account","Holy cow, this game was rad.\n\nThere'll be a handy list of all the pros and cons below if you're into that sort of thing, although it is a bit concise. If you're a patient reader who can handle a crap-ton of text (or an in-depth review, you could say) I wholeheartedly recommend you to tag along.\n\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that this game was not developed by Frictional Games, the developers behind the Penumbra games and The Dark Descent.  This is a collaboration between Frictional and The Chinese Room.  Frictional merely published this game.\n\nThe number one complaint  this game got on release was that "it wasn't as scary as The Dark Descent". Heck, most even said that "it wasn't scary at all".\n\nI completely disagree.  I found this game to be scary,  most definitely so. I don't know how this came to be, but this is definitely how I felt while playing the game. You might already be thinking that I'm a colossal wuss, which I humbly deny, as this is definitely not the first horror game I've played. I went into the game with the same expectations as everyone else, thinking that it's the weakest of Frictional's titles and all that.  So don't be turned off by the fact that others didn't have a scary time with this game.  I surely did.\n\nComplaint number two was directed at the lack of resource management, which has been a core feature of all Frictional's past titles.  This game does not feature an inventory or tinderboxes, and the lantern has infinite fuel. There is also no sanity system and health is regenerated automatically.  People flipped their sh*t when they heard of this, let me tell you. I spent a good thirty minutes looking at the Metacritic user reviews for this game, and they all basically roasted the game for having "dumbed down the gameplay to oblivion" and "taken away the fear of losing light".\n\nI can see the logic behind both of these arguments, especially the latter. The former just seems silly. I actually didn't like the resource management in The Dark Descent that much, as tinderboxes were way too common and oil was really hard to find. I felt restricted because I didn't want to waste any oil. Infinite fuel seemed like a godsend if anything. Despite this, the game wasn't too bright at all, I'd say it was the opposite.\n\nThe monsters were also a dissapointment for most people,  and I actually kind of agree on this one. I'm not saying they weren't scary, because they were (they're monsters for a reason, duh). They just weren't "as scary". One of the major cons I would personally give this game is the  terror meter/chase theme . Perhaps one of the most iconic pieces of audio in Frictional's games are the terror meters, which are basically the monsters' chase themes. Not only do they indicate that the monster has begun its hunt and that you should haul a**, they are a critical factor in maintaining the suspense of the chase. I'm sure everyone remembers the diabolical screeching  in The Dark Descent, as it was easily distinguishable and altogether terrifying. SOMA had multiple, one for each monster type, all of which were f*cking terrifying as well.  A Machine for Pigs' chase theme, when compared to the others, is a pretty big miss.  It's basically machine noises. And when you take into consideration that you will be near machinery for a big part of the game, the mistake becomes clear. One time I had literally no idea that I was being hunted, just because the chase theme was so quiet and indistinguishable from the ambience. The chases were still pretty scary, but definitely lost some of the terror that the other games had.\n\nLet's now look at some things that people actually liked, for once.\n\nThe story is definitely one of the major things A Machine for Pigs got right.  The Chinese Room as a developer has their focus set on story-driven games, and it shows. The story is such an improvement from The Dark Descent's, which I found to be quite dull and it didn't catch my interest.  As this is a story-driven game at heart, you absolutely must tag along with it and pay attention to the notes and dialogue.  The writing is stellar, and the notes were a blast to read. I wouldn't say that the story reaches SOMA's level of excellence, but it's great nonetheless.\n\nFrictional's titles all possess brilliant sound design, and this is no exception.  The overall audio is great, especially the voice acting. The composer isn't our beloved Mikko Tarmia this time, but Jessica Curry still managed to make an epic score suitable for a horror game like this.\n\nI haven't seen many people talking about the environments, actually. I thought that the overall milieu was certainly more interesting than in The Dark Descent. I didn't really like TDD's trite castle setting, so I eagerly awaited what this game had to offer. After my first hour with the game I was already very happy with the choice they made. As a big fan of steampunk, I found the environments quite pleasing.\n\nI guess I've covered it all now, so here's the promised list for the impatient.\n\nPROS\n\nStory is brilliant and a huge improvement over The Dark Descent's.\nSetting was especially pleasing to me. (Steampunk environments are fun.)\nOverall audio is great. (Do it justice and use headphones, please.)\nYes, it can actually be scary. I went into it with the same expectations as everyone else, and still got scared plenty.\n\nTHE NEUTRAL STUFF, I GUESS\n\nInventory is gone. (I actually didn't mind it at all.)\nInfinite light. (People are still flipping their sh*t over this. I actually like this change, f*ck resource management.)\nLess objects to throw...? (I don't care, neither should you.)\nNo sanity system. (I actually don't like that you can look at the enemy all you want, but it's better than getting lasting effects from it. SOMA did this right by disrupting your vision only when you look at the damn things.)\n\nCONS\n\nThe monsters aren't as scary. (They're still scary, not just  as  scary.)\nThe terror meter. (a.k.a the monster chase theme. It's very quiet and indistinguishable from the ambience, and not very scary at all.)\nA tad short when compared to the other games. Took me seven hours to beat, but it can be easily beaten in five.\nSummary\n\nI still don't understand why people are so mad about this game. The things that they took away from this sequel aren't really that significant, and I found the changes to be quite good. The story is a huge improvement over the last game's. And yes, the game can still be scary, especially if you play it in a proper environment (at night, in the dark and with headphones. This is how every horror game should be played, for goodness' sake!).\n\nI honestly thought this was a worthy sequel. Such a shame that everyone seemed to dislike it.","May 15","true","7.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","4"

Let's establish that above all else. However, we should move into what makes it incredible.\n\nThe story is amazing; unlike anything I've ever seen before. I cannot stress this enough. It's bizarre. It's odd. It's unsettling. Above all, it's deep. It's dramatic. The story is dark, and easily one of the top three original stories I've ever come across. This is coming from someone who avidly reads Stephen King.\n\nThe atmosphere: where do I begin? It feels dark, gloomy, hopeless, sad, eerie, underlyingly sinister. While there aren't necessarily monsters around every corner, there is something else: a clue. There are hints scattered within the entire game about what's really going on. These come in the form of not only journal entries, but paintings, blood stains, architectual designs, and decorative mediums. If you put thought into the reasonings for layouts, placed items, etcetera, they'll do more than spook you once you figure out the justification for it. Nearly nothing in the environment is placed randomly.\n\nSIde note: I'd really like to talk about the writing in the game for a bit. First, the journals. The journals reveal so very much about what's going on in the story. They reveal secrets that are not otherwise concluded or mentioned in the game, and do require thought to figure out why they're there. Also, they're not necessarily out in the open; you'll have to search for them a bit.\nSecondly, the dialogue. The dialogue is SO beautifull crafted. The monologues are incredible, heart-felt, deep, meaningful, and thought-provoking (not to mention the wonderful voice-acting). The dialogue is one of the major things that pumps such vivid life into this piece of art.\nTo sum up these two paragraphs, the journal entries and diologue are nearly poetry. They're beautiful.\n\nIt's been said in other reviews, but I'll say it again: if you're looking for jump scares, this is not your game. At all. Let me repeat that. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR JUMP SCARES, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\nOn the contrary, if you're looking for  an incredible experience, a wonderfully crafted story, a bizarre, unique atmosphere, and you appreciate looking for meaning, this game is for you. ENGLISH TEACHERS OR APPRECIATERS OF ART OF ANY KIND, STOP READING AND BUY. IT'S INCREDIBLY WORTH IT. Better thana the majority of 'meaningful' movies to have come out recently.\n\nAbout the gameplay: yes, as you've probably read, there is no oil. There is no insanity meter. There is no constant danger. Don't expect there to be. The reasoning for this is that you're supposed to be enjoying the environment, not scavanging through it looking for survival tools. There are also no mind-bending puzzles. You may get stumped for a bit (I know I did), but you will persevere.\nAlso, I'd like to mention that this game is not meant to be rushed through. You're meant to take your time. Do this by examining each room. Examine each detail. Read each journal entry and put thought into it. FIgure out why what's there is there. Make justifications, BE THE DETECTIVE! It's called Amnesia because you're supposed to figure out what happened. Please acknowledge this.\n\nThe game has a mature rating. Yes, there is slight strong language and gore, a bit of nudity as well. However, the main reason to stick to the 17+ rating is that the story isn't meant for anyone younger. The story is meant to be taken very seriously, as a drama. The majority of younger players will not appreciate the artistic value that lies in this game, simply because most are not yet mature enough.\n\nI recommend this game. I recommend it very, VERY highly. I don't leave reviews for things often. But especially with the mixed reviews this game has gotten, it needs to be justified and given the credit it so greatly deserves. 10/10, I don't think there's a single thing this game could have dont better. I mean this from the very bottom fo my heart.\n\nEnjoy the game.","December 26, 2014","true","7.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I think it would have done great as a stand alone release. I think the namesake was the reason so many people did not like it. It had high hopes to live up to, but did not even come close.

I was amazed at the amount of ineractivity, even if there was no reason for it. I loved the puzzles, and the fact that sometimes the sulotion was as simple and as frustrating as smashing open a power box with a brick I found on the floor.\nThere was a definite story improvement as the Penumbra series went on, and I was also impressed with Amnesias storytelling, and effects on the player and their mental health.\n\nHowever, A Machine For Pigs lost me. Most of the world was non-interactive, i never had to move things out of the way to look behind them, the puzzles just seemed to be, can you get this simple thing. There was no patterns that I had to solve, or mental puzzles that had to be thought out, or even things that I could get lucky on, it just all seemed to mainstream simple to me. The effects on the players mental health etc only took place for short bursts, and mostly just made you unable to move. Felt much more like a classic movie horror, then an actually scary puzzle game.\nDon't get me wrong here, if you let yourself be scared, you still will be.\nIt did have some of the good elements, like not quite letting you see the scary thing on the other side of that wall, and the audio (recommend headphones) was as always terrifying. However the other missing elements stopped me from being fully emersed in the game.\nI tried going back to the game a few times, hoping that the old style would return after the introduction section, but I am sad to say that it didn't.\n\nI will continue to admire the original author for what he created before, but I can't see myself buying the next game if this is the direction it is taking.\nI will however, highly recommend all the previous titles, I even bought copies of a few for friends.\nAnd to be direct, i played the first amnesia for free, then bought it because it was worth the money. Then I bought Penumbra.\n\nIf the author is taking feedback, here are my suggestions:\n1. Return to interactivity, make the objects in the world pick-upable, they can move, and can be pushed by other objects, but not picked up.\n2. make the puzzles hard again, I know you can make more money by creating simplistic puzzles for the common player, but it just defeats the game.\n3. Bring back the horror, instead of having "horror" cut scenes, bring back the character getting scared of things even if they have seen them before,\n\nThere also needs be other options for "would you reccomend this game" I Can't decide, I am saying no though, purely compared to the previous games.\nHowever I would also recommend this game, it was worth playing, it just wasn't compared to the previous games.\nI will try to finish this game if I can, one last time, before I give up on it.","January 21, 2014","false","0.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

It's quite obvious that a lot went into the multiple environments and the dark levels. It looks brilliant and it feels great, you can stand there and soak up all the detail in each individual level. The story is utterly brilliant, it’s dark and somewhat surprising, if this game would to be made into a book, and it would be a damn good one. It’s immersive (the story) and it’s one of the kind of stories that don’t really start from ‘A’ to ‘B’ but it’s one of those stories where you’re caught somewhere between ‘A’ and ‘B’ and you pick it up along the way. It may seem like a good game, right? Well…\n\nOn the downside, most of us were expecting a scare right? Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs sadly falls short of that department. The A.I aren’t as scary as the one’s in the first, they don’t seem to be ‘hunting’ you, most of the time they’re just shuffling along past you looking pretty for the spotlight. On that note, the monsters look brilliant, but personally are a little stupid. Most of the interactive environment as we see in Amnesia: The Dark Descent is taken away so we’re given more of an immersive experience (This has its upsides and downsides.) Also, this makes the game more of a ‘rail’ where you are lead most of the way to the end and it’s not as tempting to go find hidden items/secrets because there's really nothing to find, besides the main path. Also, the Inventory is taken away as well as the first Amnesia’s famous Sanity Bar, which on the plus side leaves us with fewer things to worry about, but sort of takes away the risk of it all.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the game is fantastic in story, and graphics, but falls woefully short in what most of us came to this game for: the fear. Personally, if this game were to have ‘Amnesia’ taken out of the title, and only left with ‘A Machine for Pigs’ as a stand-alone game. Then this game would be very unique and fantastic, but as a sequel to the first Amnesia, it doesn’t do so well.\n\nPersonal Gaming Score:\n6/10\n\nHighly recommend this game for those wanting an immersive story/environment or those looking for a great game to play, but a bit of a disappointment for those looking for a scary game or came here from the first game.","January 20, 2014","true","4.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","6"

Maybe if I had paid full price during its initial release with high expectations I would have been let down but in the end I thought it was a good game.\n\nTo be sure, it's not as good as the first one. With the first game I actually had to stop at various points because I was too nervous to progress into a darkened area. There's only one scene in this one where I felt close to that level of scared. This game simply isn't as horrifying this time around. It's also a considerably shorter, more streamlined experience -- there's less interactivity, puzzles, etc.\n\nAnother thing that disappoints me was the lack of a custom story option. The original Amnesia has hours and hours of replay value that this does not because of it. The game is different enough than the original that there's potential for a number of custom stories using the elements present here.\n\nOn the positive side, the game is still an effective and atmospheric experience. I would stay the story is stronger this time around. The protagonist Oswald Mandus plays a much bigger part in his own story than Daniel did in the first one and as such his his character arc is more rewarding in my opinion. The game's world is beautiful and haunting to look at; I stopped several times just to take in the scenery. I normally don't talk about music in games but Jessica Curry's soundtrack really adds to the story.\n\nThe developers had the unenviable task of following up 'The Dark Descent' and to their credit they took a risk as opposed to simply copying the formula of the original. Not all of it works but I still have to applaud their efforts.\n\nIf you're all hesitant I would wait until this is on sale but I do recommend you try it out at least once.","July 2, 2015","true","9.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaedraven/recommended/239200/","Jaedraven","Raven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaedraven/","112 products in account","Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a psychological thriller created as the sequel to the first game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Although the game plays somewhat like the first installment, it is actually a very different game in terms of storytelling and jump scares. Let me just say, if you are going into this game expecting the same experience as the first, you will be disappointed.\n\nA Machine for Pigs takes place in the late 1800’s after the industrial revolution, and the world has been modernized. Gone is the need for lantern oil, and tinderboxes, as your new lantern never runs out of battery power. Sanity is also apparently not an issue any longer and you won’t have to deal with any inventory screens either. The story itself is a long twisting tale of a tortured man who has done some pretty awful things. His journey to reclaim his troubled memories is a journey through the mind of a man driven to the brink of insanity from the overbearing weight of emotional loss. Determined to correct his mistakes and set everything right, he finds himself on the precipice of his own destruction.\n\nAs for gameplay, the traditional Amnesia style of solving puzzles shines through as the player will need to solve many throughout the game by interacting with the environment around them. The sound is, of course, another compliment to the Amnesia series, and gives the player that same sense that they are being followed continuously by something… or someone.\n\nThere are a couple chase sequences and moments where the player will be required to hide in the darkness to avoid detection, but the monsters themselves seem to be rather linear and will appear and run off in a preplanned route many times throughout the game. Most people were disappointed with the monsters as they don’t actually bust down doors and search for you like they did in the original Amnesia. Basically, if you avoid them then they will avoid you. But that does not mean it isn’t scary, the atmosphere of the game is incredibly creepy and there is barely any warning as to when a monster is in the area.\n\nMy overall score for the game: 8/10. This game is worth playing for the story alone. Go into this game as ‘A Machine for Pigs’ and not ‘Amnesia.’ As a game of its own, it is great and worth checking out. But if you are looking for the same horror experience as the original Amnesia, skip this one and try out Soma.\n","May 19","true","10.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reverendsalem/recommended/239200/","reverendsalem","ReverendSalem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reverendsalem/","722 products in account","I have a confession to make.\n\nI never finished the first Amnesia. It's more accurate to say that, according to Steam, I have played 28 minutes of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That includes times spent setting up options in the menu. So in reality, I've gotten far enough that the first strong gust of wind howled through a corridor before I quit. I'd like to say that's because I didn't like the controls. Admittedly, I do prefer gamepads to mouse and keyboard, but the atmospheric elements of Amnesia: TDD kinda scared me.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine For Pigs recently went on sale for 66% off on Steam, so I decided to roll the dice. It does, for the record, support gamepads. As far as the technical aspects of the game, Frictional teamed with The Chinese Room, creators of Dear Esther (developer of 2008's popular First Person Walking Simulator Dear Esther). It's got a fairly hefty options menu, and the game looks gorgeous (when you can see it).  It ran well on my GTX770, and once I'd nailed down a particularly nasty case of screen tearing (disable in-game Vsync, both regular and adaptive, and enable it in the Nvidia Control Panel or your ATI equivalent), the game ran at a smooth 60 FPS with no screen tearing. The gamepad controls were responsive and simple to learn, and even the object manipulation mechanic of the first game translated well from mouse to thumbsticks.\n\nThis is not an overly complex game, though. It's pedigree shows through, as many sources have said that this game is far simpler in its gameplay mechanics than the previous Amnesia title. Your lantern has unlimited oil. There are no items to pick up, no laudanum to keep you sane. Your character is obviously far more mentally stable, seeing as the monsters in this game doesn't affect your ability to cope with the world around you.\n\nWhere A Machine For Pigs really shines is its storytelling. You wake up in a caged bedroom of a properly posh Victorian mansion, and bits of story are slowly fed to you throughout your descent (a dark one!) into the heart of a Steampunk monstrosity of brass tubes, gears, pistons, and oh-so-many nauseating swine carcasses. Like many dark horror stories, there are aspects that fall apart if you look at it too closely, but the game wraps up before most people have time to question those aspects. The game runs about 4 to 4 and a half hours, but that's a tight 4 and a half hours, with very few wasted moments, and a hectic (if overly obviously scripted) sequence later in the game where the monsters really come into play. Overall, it's dripping (quite literally at times) with atmosphere\n\nIs it worth the usual $20 price tag? That's all going to depend on whether you're a big horror buff. Personally, I'm not. That I only paid < $7 for the game, goes a long way to my personal valuation. I feel I got my money's worth, even though it didn't quite hit that “dollar-per-hour” magic mark. If you're a fan of horror, I recommend this at a higher price than I paid, especially if you like your horror to come from the storytelling as much as the gameplay.","June 3, 2014","true","4.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The flair of Amnesia is the feeling that you can't fight whatever is after you, sneaking around and hiding are your only way to survive. In Machine for Pigs this mechanic is less pronounced. I felt like the enemies weren't that treatening, I felt like I could run, like I could beat them. This is notthe feeling that creates terror (something that I expect from a game in the horror genre). Overall I wouldn't recommend Machine for Pigs.","October 21, 2014","false","2.6"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

For starters, it was a rather short game especially being the same $20 price as the first Amnesia game, which consited of much more playtime. The storyline was father boring and consited of a very predictable plot twist towards the end. Enemy encouters were hard to come by and usually lasted only a couple seconds along with being really easy to avoid. They removed the inventory, sanity feature, oil, tinderboxes, as well as the ability to interact with items in the environment. From other reviews read along with conversations in forums it appears the game also consits of capability issues making it hard for some people to even be able to play the game. If you are someone looking to purchase this game just buy the first one, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. And if you already bought it and beat it you're better of just downloading custom stories which are free and very easy to install.","April 24, 2014","false","8.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The story focuses on Mandus, a wealthy industrialist from the late 19th century who wakes up with, well, Amnesia. His intention is to find his children who are no where to be found.\n\nThe atmosphere in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs (AMFP) is always spooky and unsettling. There is never a moment where you don't apprehend something scary happening. I suppose this could be argued to be a disadvantage. The environments are both visually good looking and interesting and always kept me staring at things.\n\nI personally believe that AMFP does not live up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent(TDD). Although AMFP kept me on my toes for most of the game, I feel that there are some integral things missing. Those which made TDD a truly brilliant horror game.\nFirst of all, the monsters. Probably the most important element in a horror game, the monsters are the beings which make you fear every door opening and puzzle completion. The monsters in AMFP were not terribly frightening as those in TDD. There is something about human form monsters being scarier than animal form monsters, in the sense that I suppose we can relate to human form monsters, rather than animal form. By human form I mean stand up straight on two legs, like the monsters in TDD. The monsters in TDD are horrific because of their disfigured bodies, especially The Grunt. As for the telsa pig...well... I found it to be a bit silly.\n\n"You can look, but you can't touch" - If you know what this is, then you know what is coming next... Interaction. An important concept from TDD. But, it was completely removed in AMFP, apart from a few essential things required to progress through the story. This was... dissapointing. I loved the aspect in TDD. Picking up books and looking at them made the game even more immersive. The fact that this is not present in AMFP seems a bit...lazy. Yes I said it. The Chinese Room were very aware that this was an important concept in TDD and yet failed to implement it properly in AMFP.\n\nAnother important point that may seem trivial to some, is the absence of "Danger close monster music". The monster music in TDD was brilliantly composed. The truly chilling and terrifying music, that played when a monster was near, rang in my mind after playing TDD. I think that it would have been an excellent addition to AMFP if this was implemented. Although, when a monster is near in AMFP, the absence of music is still fairly scary. Also...the flickering lamp concept. Just seems like it ruins the point of a horror game, being warned that something scary is approaching.\n\nOK, rant over.\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a fantastic game, don't get me wrong. It just seems like it could be better. It is a very disturbing game that focuses on a distrurbing and strong story.\n\nIf you enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent, then you may be a little disappointed by AMFP, but none the less, you will enjoy this game for what there is. So try to avoid comparing if to TDD because the truth is that it is not as good, but it is still enjoyable.","December 11, 2013","true","11.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It is a good horror game overall and the concept is interesting. The story is very messed up, but comparing this to The Dark Descent feels like a bit of an insult. The TAB inventory is gone, your lantern doesn't need any sort of resource to work, so you can just use it all the time. It flashes sometimes in an attempt to scare you, but failed for me. Survival elements are pretty much gone! You have about 5 encounters with enemies throughout the game, but that isn't exactly a negative thing...\n\nI was shocked with how linear this game felt - the puzzles were too easy, and the atmosphere isn't even half good as the previous game. It's also a very short game taking me 3.5 hours to beat (not speedrunned). As I was saying, linear is the best I can describe A Machine for Pigs. You can't pick up / grab most of the objects to have some fun like you could in the previous game. When you do, you can be almost sure that said object will be used for a less-than-challenging puzzle.\n\nJessica Curry did a good job on composing the soundtrack. It is actually well-executed but not as panic-inducing or creepy as TDD. The concept art is great and the looks are pretty much like The Dark Descent. Not many graphical improvements are seen but it's still a good looking game.\n\nThe verdict: Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a good horror game, but not *that* good compared to the first Amnesia. To be honest, I was only scared about twice through the whole game, and I am a coward Nemesis in what comes to horror. It's a bit overpriced for a four hour experience, and I consider this a slightly wasted potential, because story-wise, it is better than the first one. If you're interested in it, wait until it goes on sale. After all, I still had a great time exploring 1899's London and what lies beneath it! Come here piggy, piggy!\n\nToo long, didn't read?

The Dark Descent filled me with horrors and left me with many sleepless nights. It was and still is in my opinion, the best horror game ever made. Amnesia A Machine for Pigs placed me in the shoes of the wealthy Oswald Mandus, another Amnesiac like Daniel. Like its predocessor, the game successfully builds tension unlike any other. I was terrifyed as I opened any door for fear of what lurked on the other side. The story surpasses The Dark Descent's, and the game has one of the best soundtracks I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. The Sanity Meter is gone, which saddened me, and I no longer had to scavenge for Landanum and Oil for my lantern. And then there's the monsters. I won't spoil anything, but when I did encounter them, even though they are terrifying, the soundtrack didn't distort and the screen didn't blurr, which was one of my favourite things about the original. Even though the game was stripped of these mechanics, Amnesia A Machine for Pigs was still an inticing and thoroughly engrossing experience. I highly reccomend it to fans of the original and horror fans in genreal. Amnesia A Machine for Pigs isn't the kind of horror you may be expecting, but it's a welcome change that stands out from many other horror games, and it has and will stick with me for a long time.","January 7, 2014","true","6.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

You play as Oswald Mandus, a rich industrialist who awakens at the beginning of the game in his mansion with no memory of his recent past. It seems the he has lost his two sons and his wife is may be dead. There is something very strange going down with regard to pigs in and around his home and adjacent factory. You move through the ominous mansion in first person, piecing together your troubled past courtesy of notes, the odd entry in your journal, sound recordings that play on Victrola-like devices and even telephone conversations with a mysterious man who may have your children held captive in the bowels of the factory.\nYou guide Mandus through the game, you will often face problems that need solving in order to progress. Most of the time you will just have to pull a level or two, sometimes having to retrace your steps in order to find the item that goes into the item-shaped hole. This all sounds very basic, and it is.\nIn the previous game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, players had to carefully manage the oil in their lamps, while also attempting to maintain their sanity. A Machine for Pigs abandons this gameplay mechanic entirely. You have a lamp, with unlimited power and any notion of turning insane, simply is not present.\nWith unlimited supplies, players are free to explore without hindrance; a feature which will make some players happy and others not so much. Those who enjoyed the sense of fear and pressure evoked when running low on supplies in The Dark Descent, will find A Machine for Pigs a little disappointing in this respect.\nThere are tons of creepy sounds throughout the game and a lot of great music too, some of it is beautiful and haunting, while some is very creepy and vile.\nA Machine for Pigs has increased graphics compared to The Dark Decent, but it has less gameplay features that made the game easier and also the survival horror aspect is reduced compared to the first “Amnesia”.\nAll in all, I can still say that Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a game that all horror fans should play. The soundtrack alone will make most people feel fear, with the visuals and gameplay certainly not taking much away from the experience.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 5/10\nAtmosphere 7/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","December 26, 2013","true","8.1"," 33 of 61 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","33","61","0","0"

Hmmm...\n\nIt certainly has a rival for the scariest SOUNDTRACK for a game ever (the load screens alone filled me with more dread than most so-called "horror" games)!  And it's definitely in the running for the most "sinister" game ever (my much-beloved Silent Hill series being the closest competitors herein).\n\nBut more than anything, I would say this possibly emerges as the single most "oppressive" video game ever.  Put it this way:  If you're in any way claustrophobic and/or unnerved by the near-constant humming, banging, clanging, hissing and clattering of machinery...then you may be in for a somewhat stressful experience.  And if you in any way harbour a phobia of PIGS, then suffice it to say you're SCREWED.  Even the squeaky doors grunt like pigs when you open them.  This game sets up a near-relentless atmosphere of being trapped in a nightmare you can't escape, at least as well as any game before it, and possibly then some.  I personally found I had to muster a certain amount of "courage" up just to commit to a session of gameplay.  Let's just say you gotta be in "the mood"...\n\nA further warning though:  For those who vastly prefer busy "gameplay" elements over story, this may not be the game for you.  This one is almost ALL about story, though evidently not as much as The Chinese Room's previous is-it-or-isn't-it-a-game experience, Dear Esther.  Sure, there's a bit of (not-TOO-challenging) machinery-based puzzle-solving, and a few scenes where you'll be running for your dear life not even knowing what the hell is chasing you (but daring not to look back, at any cost!)...yet the JOURNEY is what this game is all about, just as Esther was...just with a little more action along the way.  All in all though, anyone who got anything out of Esther, and not to mention the first Amnesia, is unlikely to be disappointed by this overly successful mating of its two spiritual predecessors.\n\n(An afterthought:  Should I be concerned about the degree to which I sympathised with the game's more, erm, "anti-social" themes?  I'm not even sure I entirely agree with the protagonist's last-ditch attempts to "redeem" himself in the last few chapters.  "Kill them, my little piggies!

I'm personally not fond of Dear Esther myself, but that is for another review.\n\nThe gameplay is probably the biggest difference between the two games. In A Machine for Pigs, the game is much more linear than The Dark Descent. There are not many areas to explore, as most of the areas require you to finish the puzzle and continue your way on. Personally this did not bother me very much, however if you are a hardcore Amnesia fan this might upset you. The game has very few items to grab and fool around with; mostly items required for the path are the only items that can be grabbed. A Machine for Pigs removes the inventory, which automatically removes all aspects of obtainable items.\n\nThe monsters in A Machine for Pigs are much different from The Dark Descent in many ways. It is clear they are from a different type of horror, being The Dark Descent monsters much more scary. The ManPigs in A Machine for Pigs are not scary to the extent the monsters are in The Dark Descent; however some monsters later in the game might sway ones opinion. I will not go into detail of the monsters to reveal any spoilers.\n\nPossibly the most obvious change from The Dark Descent is the setting. The Dark Descent took place during the 1800’s in a castle, while A Machine for Pigs takes place during the last hours of 1899 of London. All of the scenery is replaced with early 20th century buildings and machinery, with the end result looking spot on for the appropriate time frame.\n\nA Machine for Pigs sadly is not very user friendly in the custom story department, as the game has no support for custom stories.  If you own The Dark Descent, you can head over to Frictional Games’ forum to obtain the pre-release of an upcoming update for The Dark Descent to utilize the new model format (.FBX) from A Machine for Pigs.\n\nOverall opinion: A Machine for Pigs was scary, but not scary enough. That being said, the story is fantastic and much better than The Dark Descent in many ways. Without reading the notes, the player might become confused what happened in the story. If you are a fan of Amnesia and of pigs, this title is for you. If you didn’t find A Machine for Pigs scary, try The Dark Descent. If you think either one of those are not scary, try out the Penumbra series created by Frictional Games. Penumbra might change your opinion quickly.\n\nLink for pre-release update for The Dark Descent: http://frictionalgames.com/forum/thread-23378.html\n","December 23, 2013","true","7.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

No, the art was fine. Assume that every other element of the work fails. if that promise of art and atmosphere is still enough for you, stop reading this review and go on and buy it.\n\nBut once you've had your fill of the art, what's left is plot, and the plot, the thrust of the game, is totally craftless.\nAs is standard for amnesia, you discover partway through that you're supposedly someone who's done terrible things. The problem with that is the game spends the first three quarters letting you operate under the assumption that you are not that person, and developing an in-universe identity who's done nothing but try to protect his children. So, when the game tells you that you did something baffling and awful and there is blood on your hands, that you built a hell machine and oiled it with the blood of men, yes you, the person who probably baught this game because you were attracted to its strong anti-industrialist themes, this is the emotional reaction almost all players are going to have in light of this revelation:\n\nNo. No, I didn't do any of that. My hands are clean, and none of this has any relevance to me. I am not even slightly invested in the role.\n\nAnd it really is all totally irrelevant to you because, as in The Dark Descent, the very empty explanation as to why our player character did these things seems to reduce to the influence of some black box alien artifact. You know, something that's explicitly not trying to analogize any real-world system, past, present or speculative future. Even if you were, against pragmatism, curious about this thin fictional construct, the game gives you basically no information.\n\nDespite the familiarity of the industrial distopean setting, none of it is meaningful (beyond the premise itself, which is great, but that is conveyed in full by the cover text). It is not a commentary, or if it is, its angle is deliberately obfuscated. Not in a fun way. In a "there's no hint that there is any thematic puzzle here to be solved" way. If you think Dan Pinchbeck has said something meaningful, you could just as well be imagining it.","November 10, 2015","false","5.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/239200/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","Right on the heels of playing Amnesia: The Dark Descent I jumped into Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Despite the fact that it was developed by a different group and has a completely different setting, I was expecting to have a very similar experience. While the beginning was very similar, as the game progressed it diverged in many ways, and not all of them were bad.\n\nUnlike the first game, the player character has a very specific goal from the beginning: find his children. At first I thought that he hadn't lost all of his memories, but as the story progressed it became clear that he didn't know how the machinery around him worked, even though he was clearly the one who had built it.\n\nLighting is very important, and just like the original you get a lantern to light your way. However, this lantern never runs out of juice, and spending time in the darkness doesn't affect your character's sanity. I found this very odd, because it was one of the main sources of tension and fear in the first game. As it turns out, A Machine for Pigs is much more about the story it has to tell than it is about scaring your pants off.\n\nThe story starts off slowly, when the game is still at its scariest. It then builds into an arch that I don't want to say anything about because it would be very easy to spoil and it really is the strong point of the game.\n\nThe themes surprisingly focused heavily on the class struggle of the late 1800s, and utilized pigs as the metaphors and imagery for almost everything. In a way it reminds me of the social commentary that Bioshock gave, but a much smaller taste.\n\nThe gameplay was a lot simpler than the first game. Most of the tasks that I had to complete wouldn't even count as puzzles, they were that straightforward. It probably helped that most objects that were interactable were puzzle elements. For example, I once found a candle that I could pick up; suspecting that there was a puzzle coming up that required it, I brought it with me. I was right. A lot of the drawers and doors had these huge visible locks on them that clearly meant "You cannot open this, there is nothing useful inside, and the developers don't want you wasting all of your time opening tons of drawers because there isn't any health or sanity for you to worry about. Just move along and continue the story we have crafted for you."\n\nOne of the creepiest things in the game were these colorful pigmasks. They would show up in areas that I had already explored, and occasionally disappear again while I wasn't looking. It gave me the sensation that I was being watched. I also suspect that they sometimes changed the map around me, similar to Antichamber but much less obvious. Or maybe I just got myself lost.\n\nOddly, there were several things in the game that reminded me of Portal 2. In many areas there were large maps of the complex with the area I was in highlighted so I could tell how close to my goal I was.\n\nThere was also this one walkway that would have fit right in among the older parts of Aperture Science.\n\nA Machine for Pigs was a very well-made narrative, and it moved me deeply. However, it was extremely short at 4.5 hours long. I would price this game at $10, so wait until it goes on sale.","October 12, 2013","true","4.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I truly believe it was fantastic.\n\nIt is definitely different than The Dark Descent, but it engaged me just as strong as the original did along with terrifying me in new ways.\n\nThe level design,story, atomosphere, lighting, and sound all come together to create a world that is disturbing, frightening, forbidding, and at the same time compelling. I was terrified to continue exploring, but I was too curious not too. I needed to know what was going on. I NEEDED to know, who the main character was, what had happened to his family, and what this massive machine truely was.\n\nOnce I began my descent into this machine, I felt the horror and mystery begin to dig their icy claws into my soul.\n\nThe Dark Descent gained most of its terror from the atmosphere and its monsters trying to kill you. Here it is what the atmosphere, main character, story, monsters, and surroundings, and what they representthat is so terrifying. It is also a strong exploration into the mind of a madman, as he tries to atone for his mistakes and come to terms with the horrible things he has done.\n\nOnce I had begun to unravel the story, where the pigs came from, the main character's past, the machine's purpose, and what it all represented to me, I experienced a style of terror and horror that I have not felt since Silent Hill 2.\n\nA Machine for Pigs is NOT The Dark Descent. It has a much stronger stoyr focus, simplified gameplay, and completely different ways of horrigying you, so if you go into this expecting The Dark Descent 2, then you may be disappointed.\n\nIf you wanted another Dark Descent, then go play The Dark Descent. I however, don't like when horror games stay in the same area too long (I'm looking at you resident evil) but a true way to expand upon horror is to approach it in new ways.\n\nA Machine for Pigs does this, and it does it damn well.\n","September 21, 2013","true","3.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

I actually think it should have gone further, because some elements remove me from the experience so their voice actors can have a talk at the player. There is also a dispiriting lack of chases by monsters. So why did this game take two years to make? Because it's a finely crafted experience, one with excellent design and unrelenting dread, the kind that actually creeped me the ♥♥♥♥ out instead of vaguely irritating me. Even the jump scares, an incredibly worn out cliche, are done effectively and with reason.

Im not too sure what to say about AAMFP. I, being a huge fan of TDD, had been looking into this game since it was announced. The idea of the game really got me pumped up, and the lack of real information made me even more excited about its release. The amount of delays was really upsetting though. The game (I think) was originally set to release in October 2012 (Again, Im not sure), but was released in September 2013. When the game showed up on Steams store page, I instantly bought it for pre-load. On the day it came out, I instantly got out of bed, started up my PC and started playing. In short, it was one of the most dissapointing things ever. For starters, Custom Story was taken off. That part really upset me. Gameplay wise, there is now no inventory system, no tender boxes, and unlimited oil, taking away greatly from the survival horror feel. Also, the Insanity system was removed. When a monster is seen, it doesnt give the insanity effect that was seen in TDD. Story wise, I thought they had something going. I liked the idea of the story. It is one of the main reasons I got excited for the game in the first place. But like a lot of the other reviews are saying, it is like a toned down versoin of TDD. Im not saying that its the worst game ever made or anything. I just thing that maybe, just maybe, if Frictional Games was the only one who worked on this, it could be a little bit better.

You play as Oswald Mandus, a wealthy English businessman and a loving father, who has recently returned from a trip to Mexico. Sick and feverish, Mandus is startled awake in the middle of the night by the sound of his children calling out for him. Following the echoes of their voices, Mandus enters the cellar of his house. If only he knew what he would discover down in the depths.\n\nA Machine for Pigs is probably best described as an indirect sequel to The Dark Descent, and though it shares the Amnesia name, the developers are not the same, and jumping in with the expectations of it being the same game will only leave you disappointed. A Machine for Pigs is by no means a bad game, but it certainly is different from its predecessor.\n\nGameplay-wise, the most noticeable changes are the many elements that are absent compared to The Dark Descent, most notably the sanity meter and inventory. Rather than picking up items and combining them to solve puzzles, you instead must physically carry around anything that you need, and can only hold one item at a time. While this does make for much simpler puzzles overall, it also makes the game feel more immersive. There's no pausing to combine items while a monster chases you down, everything is real-time. Other than those changes, however, the game plays just like Frictional's previous games.\n\nAtmosphere is a large and critical element in any horror game, and few developers know atmosphere better than The Chinese Room, most well-known for their game Dear Esther. As you travel from your cozy mansion, to the graveyard of the church, to the industrial bowels of the Machine, the atmosphere is persistent, realistic and very intense. The monsters, though there are relatively few that pose a real threat to you, are gruesome and terrifying, and the infamous Amnesia invisible water monster even makes a return in a new form.\n\nHowever, where A Machine for Pigs truly excels is in the story. Like The Dark Descent, you start out knowing very little about yourself and your surroundings. But as the game progresses, you learn more and more, and the plot twists and turns as you uncover more about what is really happening. As you descend farther into the Machine, you discover journal entries and voice recordings revealing the story, but only at the end does everything tie together. This form of storytelling has a way of pulling the player in, giving them clues to let them piece the story together, while making them want to keep playing so they can see if they were right all along. And the ending is nothing short of satisfying. Assuming you pay attention to the notes and conversations along the way, the game's conclusion leaves you without any big questions, and wraps everything up very nicely.\n\nAs I mentioned, this game is not by any means The Dark Descent, so playing it and expecting something just like it will not leave you with the same sense of satisfaction. A Machine for Pigs is a very good game, and if it weren't for a few small issues (namely some graphical problems and simplistic puzzles) I would even call it great. And for the $20 price tag, it's certainly worth it if you're a fan of any survival horror games. It won't make you soil your pants like Outlast and it won't make you go insane like The Dark Descent, but A Machine for Pigs certainly has its place in the genre.","September 20, 2013","true","6.4"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

This is correct. I have heard complaints that this game is easier than its predecessor. This is also correct. I have heard complaints that this game is terribly bad. This is not correct.\n\nThrough effective use of sound and vision, The Chinese Room manages to create a horror game much more akin to the likes of Poe or Lovecraft, focusing on a slow burning dread rather than the all-out terror of the first Amnesia. This game is telling a story much more than the original Amnesia was. Sure, the original Amnesia did have a story and it was quite good, but the terror and the game mechanics were the centrepiece. This is not the case with A Machine for Pigs. Here, both terror and game take the backseat and the story and ambience is the main attraction. Personally I think this is a good idea, as this fits the talents of The Chinese room much better.\n\nThis is a good game. This is a great game. But do not expect a game as scary and gamey as Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sondusty/recommended/239200/","sondusty","Son Dusty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sondusty/","119 products in account","Alright, let me start off by saying that the first Amnesia was among my favorite games ever. While the scares got a bit predictable towards the end, the puzzles remained at least moderately challenging and the story that unfolded was just simply incredible. With the year delay on the release of Amnesia 2, I was really excited for this game. A small flag came up for me when I saw that Frictional partnered up with the devs behind Dear Esther (I don't care what anyone says, that isn't a "game" but a pretentious bunch of boredom thrown together to seem artsy).\n\nI'm happy to report that The Chinese Room keeps up their air of pretentious stupidity throughout this game as well.\n\nLet's start with a positive; the atmosphere is great. From the very beginning I was cautious around corners and appreciating the game.  But Chinese Room never gets past this point. They create a wonderful atmosphere, but when they ask themselves "now what?" I imagine everyone in the company just kinda shrugs and says "add more bloom effects."\n\nThere are no puzzles. With the removal of the inventory system, you simply pick up a battery and put it in a machine to open a door. It never gets any more complex than that.\n\nThere are no real enemies (besides the very small 45 second segment at the end of the game). There are stupid little pigs that walk around, but they move slower than you do. In almost every situation you can just kinda walk or run past them and you'll be ok.\n\nAs I love to say, The Chinese Room is pretentious as hell. The whole overabused theme of "we're all pigs in the machine of society," which was never original to start with, gets beaten over and over until even the most stalwart fans of these devs (which is probably the devs' mothers) have to be second guessing their taste in entertainment. But the way the narator talks, even at the end of the story, you realize that the devs really, honestly, truly believe that this is the most original metaphor that has ever been created in the history of mankind. What's truly sad is that the story itself is actually somewhat decent, I'd say nearly on par with the first Amnesia, especially with the twist. However, the ending sequence that explains everything is done in such a purposely convoluted way that it's almost as if the devs are trying to flaunt some level of intellegence to anyone who will listen. That purposeful air of arrogance from the writers comes off as overly-conceited, making it seem like they view themselves as exceedingly superior to the player.\n\nNow, for the worst part; THE GAME IS ABOUT AN HOUR LONG. I played it through once, was convinced I missed something, played it through again, and realized that I had waited and extra year for them to scrap an entire game and give me crap.\n\nThere are good aspects here in what I would like to call a demo for a much better game:\n1. The atmosphere is incredible until you realize nothing ever actually happens, which makes the buildup turn stagnant very quickly. There's no sense of danger to accompany the dark and forboding mood.\n2. There's a "final boss" if you wish to call it that, which actually has the elements of a real game. Incredible, I know, it took every ounce of actual willpower that TCR has as a dev to make a real bit of gameplay. But it's essentially over in a minute and you never get anything else even remotely like it.\n3. There's one little scene at the end where you walk around the streets of London. Again, this could have been incredible, with an open map in a phenominally made environment in a scary game where enemies could be anywhere. But wait, it's just more narrow corridors, the roads all blocked by boxes, and all of the action happening offscreen while you just walk around.\n\nThat's all this "game" is. Action is implied to be happening elsewhere, but you're lucky to even witness it. You just walk from one room to the next picking up batteries and putting them where they go to open doors for an hour, then you get the same motifs and themes beaten into you for a good couple minutes before it ends and you're sitting there thinking "did I really pay 20 dollars for an hour worth of boredom." Yes, I did. And I'm writing this review so you won't. If you're really interested in it, find a YouTuber who does Let's Plays without all the stupid 10 year old screaming and scare cams and other crap (I can't point you in the direction of one, pretty much everyone on YouTube over-acts like this, so I avoid the site entirely) and watch them play the game through.\n\nHopefully Frictional goes in another direction with Soma, otherwise I think I'm going to write this company off as a failure. I like Penumbra, and Dark Descent was a classic addition to the survival-horror genre. It's a shame they had to ruin what was shaping up to be a fantastic series of games.\n","September 21, 2015","false","3.9"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","0"

The game is not scary at all, the plot isn't very interesting (the idea is not bad, some guy being lunatic doing some crazy crap related to murder, canibalism etc, but it doesn't really feel like you want to know entire story), some great features from Dark Descent, like playing around with various objects, are simply removed. Frictional Games shot their own feet with deleting the Custom Story feature, along with putting the game back instead of expanding it from Dark Descent. This doesn't feel like sequel - it feels like somehow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of original Amnesia. Even if you somehow enjoyed the gameplay, it is ultra short - took me 3 hours to finish it, while the first one took like half a year (cause I was so scared to even launch it).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominoEventide/recommended/239200/","DominoEventide","Domino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominoEventide/","156 products in account","This game is largely unimpressive and an absolute disappointment compared to its predecessor.\n\nAdmittedly, the removal of the HUD, that is, the inventory menu, and all indications of just about anything, including loss of health and sanity (the latter of which was removed entirely), had a positive effect on immersion compared to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. However, this was quite possibly the ONLY potentially positive difference made between the games, and I use the word 'potentially' very hesitantly. Why? Because, and you can ask ANYONE who has played both games all the way through at least once, a lack of information and indication on your status in the game also causes a bigger lack of things to worry and stress about. And let's face it, what good is immersion if the gameplay itself is tedious and incites no feelings or emotions in the player other than absolute boredom, especially if you made the transition from the first to the second Amnesia video game? In the first Amnesia game, you were always constantly made aware of your health, sanity, objective, and situations/surroundings. The more you let your loss of health, sanity, and light sources get to you, the more you focused on your objective in the forms of memo and journal notes, and the more time you spent being chased by monsters or traversing through eerie environments, the more you'd have genuine feelings of fear, stress, and even despair the more you 'got into' the game.\n\nAmnesia: A Machine For Pigs has a huge problem with all of the above. Health is no longer indicated in any clear or visible form, which honestly has more of a penalty on immersion to begin with. Let's face it, if you're physically hurt, you're aware of it, because of the feelings of pain. In this game, all you can do is 'make your best guess' on your current physical well being based on your memory of how often you were hurt before and how long it had been since then. Sanity has been removed completely, further decreasing the levels of difficulty and immersion while playing, making the game itself even easier than it already is. All that's left is lore and exploration, and a video game composed of nothing but lore is NOT a video game, it's a walking simulator. Objectives are generally more confusing at first glance compared to the first game, but at the same time, they're very easy and tedious due to the fact that they are all marginally you having to walk around to specific points and interact with specific things. That's it. Goals and objectives in this game are basically normal everyday tasks in a slightly creepy environment. Speaking of environment, the next topic, the overall 'feel' of the game simply doesn't seem to fit within fear or horror anymore, and is closer to that of a creepy, almost surrealistic cliché. I mean, come on; someone wakes up in a dark room, and they have to go to laboratory full of failed and murderous genetic experiments?\n\nOh, the enemies, that's one of the biggest issues with the game. There is literally only one type of enemy which actively endangers you through the game, and only one other actual monster which is only found in the sewers, which is also there purely for cintematic effect; it's impossible to even see it up close and make contact with it. Compare this to the two enemies constantly hounding you in the first game, as well as two more found at specific points (the Kaernk or 'water monster' and the Shadow, or the bloody, goopy substance which constantly makes itself known in the form of restricting paths, adding scenery, and even actively hunting you down). More unique enemies essentially means more threat to the player. It adds a hopeless feeling of being outnumbered as well as constant paranoia that you can be watched and/or chased down more often and possibly even by more than one entity at once. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs' enemy itself isn't even anything too exraordinary, especially when compared to the first game. The way it looks and sounds, and even its background isn't frightening, it isn't scary, it isn't even eerie or creepy. In fact, it's nothing short of silly, amusing, and cliché. It essentially look like a pig on a more-than-lethal dosage of steroids.\n\nEven the lantern isn't left untouched by the transition between both Amnesia games. Yes, there is a lantern once again, but, and I personally find this to be the worst out of all other changes and features in the game, the lantern has unlimited oil and it constantly flickers on and off whenever you are close to or looking at enemies and while witnessing 'disturbing or unsettling events. In addition to the factors of this being unrealistic (which further breaks immersion) and making EVERY scary event in the game incredibly predictable and generic, it has an effect on the player which makes it easier to proceed without caution while simultaneously making it unnecessary to explore thoroughly (since you don't need to find new, unique areas to find more lantern fuel).\n\n\nAmnesia: A Machine for Pigs as a whole game feels like it was rushed and lazily made.\nUnlike in the first game, there is not, nor will there ever be any possibility of custom stories. The developers themselves have made claims that it would be 'too difficult' to add custom story support due to the new engine, and that they will instead add new content to Amnesia: The Dark Descent instead, including but not limited to: new textures, monsters, and maps. Over a year later, we haven't even heard a single word about it yet. Even assuming this would ever be true, it almost makes it pointless to even buy the sequel in the first place. The first Amnesia game would be the obvious choice out of the two for any gamer to make since A Machine for Pigs is doomed to be a single adventure with absolutely nothing different or new put into the game while The Dark Descent supposedly gets even more playability and support than it already has.\nAnother problem lies within the fact that the playtime of one single story playthrough, whether you're playing for enjoyement and story or simply rushing through it, is significantly less in A Machine for Pigs' story than in the first Amnesia game. Having not even 5 hours into the game myself and getting close to the ending (I couldn't finish it even once because I got so BORED with it, I'm sorry), while my first playthrough in the first Amnesia took me nearly 20 hours, I can confidently say that this game isn't even worth buying. I actually enjoyed the main story in The Dark Descent so much that I played it all the way through four times, simply because it was absolutely massive by comparison and plenty of 'optional' exploration possibilities. Combine this with the fact that there's a bonus of an additional mode called 'Justine' and a collection of short stories for even more curiosity-invoking lore in the 'Remember' option of the game's startup menu, as well as TONS of custom stories all for free, and it's easy to see that this Amnesia game is nothing short of an embarassment to the first.","December 2, 2014","false","4.3"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","0"

It's not a  bad  game, but it's not great either. It had the tools to be better, but I felt like it wasn't utilized right. Ignoring the 'Amnesia' in the title, I mean as a Psychological-Horror game it left me on the fence. I ain't no critic, but I always been a fan of horror, suspense and this just left me apathetic.\n\nIn short: Don't expect much if you're going to play it. I can recommend it for the atmosphere and theme, but if your looking for story it's aight\n\nLong Version: Like I said before, this has the tools. And it's frustrating every time I think about it how much of BETTER game this should've been. They had the scenery, atmosphere, and MUSIC downpack but there's other stuff that could've been executed better.\n\nWhat I mean is the writing. At point the buildup just stopped , and I felt I got left out on the mystery and suspense. Me thinking "What the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, Who,  When, Where, etc." for too long put me out of the  immersion  that I didn't understand or didn't care anymore.\n\nBy the penulimate, I FELT that ♥♥♥♥ was getting real.

It's like walking in on the middle of a movie and a bunch of stuff is happening that makes you wonder why it's happening, but the game doesn't tell you. You just wander around dark corriders hearing how nuts the main character turned out to be.\n\nShort part 2: If you like old timey English and drama, run past 2/3 of the game and learn what NOT do if you want to want to make/write your own spooky thing.","October 17, 2014","false","6.6"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

And I mean over the four or so hours it took me to clock this game, I can count the number of times I actually had any sense of fear on one hand. It had almost no puzzles, and while the story was alright, it really didn't grip me. If you want to play a game just for story, you might as well play Dear Esther. But then again, if you want a good story. WHY NOT READ A BOOK OR WATCH A MOVIE!\n\nSomewhere between the first and second hour I discovered that boredom had set in. And I was doing a speed run of the game. Which is never really any good for a horror game. People should be scared about what is around the corner, NOT RUNNING HEAD FIRST ROUND THE BEND IN A FUTILE ATTEMPT TO CURE THEIR SENSE OF BOREDOM.\n\nUltimately, People play Amnesia:AMFP to get scared. And yeah, some people would be scared by this game. Without a doubt. But it's not as scary as the original. For a start, the AI is laughably easy to avoid and ignore when compared to Amnesia, which is just pure awesome in a horror game. I mean, people are naturally scared of things that are difficult. "oh no, I'm so scared of this exam coming up", "Careful of those creatures, they'll smash you up". So if people are naturally scared of things that are difficult, or dangerous or powerful, then this begs the question: WHY THE HELL IS THE AI SO PASSIVE AND WEAK? What were they thinking? Without the threat of the AI I don't think there is anything else scary about this game. I mean the only other thing that could kill you is fall damage.\n\n\nNo puzzles and no credible threats makes Jack a dull boy.","September 13, 2013","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, you right now, reading this, might be wondering "Should I get this game?" Well, here is the answer. (In details)\n\nThe beauty of this game is not in the scares, nor the chase scenes, nor graphics but also with the story itself. It does have its moments, and it does have its creepy scenes, just not as good as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The true beauty of this game is in its story. The story of this game in my opinion is just really nice. There is a lot of hidden symbolism that I think everyone should appreciate (I do) What makes this game unique is the fact that this story can be/is related to our modern lives in a way or another. It also relates to our parents and grandparents. What I liked about this story is that we can all relate to it somehow which makes it a little better. The story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent is amazing as well but I have not seen such similar hidden symbolism. Those messages throughout that adorn the story make it stand out. Sure it may be a little complex to comprehend and maybe the story may not be explained as much due to some reason which I will explain a little further but it is a really good game if you look at it in a different perspective. Okay, so this game somehow relates to political movements and actual tragic events that happened where some people might be offended if elaborated in the game. Those who understood it appreciated it and those who did not understand the hidden messages and symbolism found that it made no sense and that the story sucks as well. I really liked this game due to its story.\n\nIf you are looking for:\n-A game that will make you feel scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n-A game that has terrifying chase scenes.\n-A game that has extra ordinary graphics.\n-A game with complex puzzles that will need you to think heavily.\n-A super long campaign that will take more than 10 hours of gameplay.\nThen this is not the game for you.\n\nIf you are looking for:\n-A game that has some terrifying scenes but not the scariest out there.\n-A game that has a beautiful story with hidden messages throughout long notes found during the gameplay.\n-A horror game that concentrates on storyline more than to try to spook you.\n-A game that has an average length of gameplay (neither short nor long).\n-A game that has descent graphics yet not the best out there.\nThen this might be the game for you.\n\nHonestly, I don't like pointless games that just want you to feel scared for the sake of it. Also, for the people who say they could have added more scare scenes and some enemies that cannot be avoided easily then I will have to say it may have worked but then it would seem to be a little unnecessary. I mean, like in some games out there where they just overload with jumpscares and that after a while gets frustrating. (In Amnesia: The Dark Descent the amount of scares and chase scenes is just perfect) but in other games like Outlast or the DLC of it to be exact feel a little repetitive and just too sloppy. You would only like the game if you want to feel scared. Also Alien: Isolation is an example that the scares just feel that they are too much and you keep dying constantly. Luckily, I like both haha, games that make me feel scared and games with good stories! Anyway, if you are planning to buy this game but not too sure buy it now when there is still a sale!

The second Amnesia is also very scary, but not really a game. You should see this more like an experience instead of a game, a very disturbing experience.\nIt still has lots of elements that you can recognize from the first game, like footsteps around the corridor, small puzzles, a few jumpscares and horrifying monster encounters. What's different compared to the first game is that you don't have to search for fuel for your lantern and the fact that the whole sanity system is removed. Because of these adjustments, I didn't feel like I was in constant danger of running out of fuel or the inability to move forward because of the drained sanity. But I still had the feeling of encountering monsters anytime during the whole game. That's because the sound design and the music was so well made and as a result, me sitting on the tip of my chair throughout the entire game.\n\nAfter a few hours of playing you realise, half relieved / half disapointed, that the game is trying to scare you with scripted scares. At that point, Amnesia lost it's grip on my heart - a bit.\n\nSometimes you have to hide and flee from monsters, these are the only actual 'game-moments'. But this game isn't as scary and tense as the first game. However this game does surpass the first game with a deeper, more disturbing and twisted plot, including some very nice themes about industrialization, massacre, war and religion.\n\nThe combination of the beautifull enviroments, music, and the disturbing story, was enough to keep me playing for 6 / 7 hours. The fact that I didn't had as much heartattacks as when I played the first game, isn't always a bad thing.\n\n7,8/10","September 28, 2013","true","18.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

While it bears the same name in terms of storytelling there's not much similarity to Dark Descent other than the protagonist suffering from amnesia.\n\nThe creators went on trying to give us more freedom - this time there's no need to collect tinkers or oil; the player can now use a lamp indefinitely and can just focus on the puzzle solving. But this is what I lacked in this new Amnesia game - puzzle solving was better and more interesting in the first one.\n\nAdditionally, now you do not need to turn away from enemies when those are approaching  (and you are hiding in the dark) - there's no head pounding, hallucination etc.  but you do not get used to the dark this time - when it is dark it really is dark and you barely see anything until you raise the lamp.\n\nOne thing I did not like is the enemy type that was... well... I cannot say anything as it would be a spoiler.\n\nMachine for Pigs is a different experience. The core elements are there, yet, it feels different. But it is an Amnesia game, nonetheless. Thus, it is still highly recommended to play it at night with a headset. But is it recommended to the fans of the first game? Hard to say... I understand those who became disappointed.

Frictional shot themselves in the foot when they licensed Amnesia to Chineese Room.\nChineese Room developed  the marvelous masterpiece 'Dear Esther'. It was one of the worst games I have ever played. Seriously, go look up gameplay of it, it's pretty hilariously bad.\n\nSo why's it bad? Because it's NOTHING like Amnesia: The Dark Descent. The atmosphere feels forced and dull, the puzzles aren't nice breaks from the non-existent horror but rather there just to make you play the game for just a bit longer. As a matter of fact, apart from the bad puzzles, there's really not any challenge in the game. The 'monster' in AAMFP is basically a slow swine, that groans and moans at you. It's not surprising, it's not scary, it's just another bump in the road on your way to the next puzzle.\n\nThe story is not too bad, but it's delivered horribly. You start the game off waking up in your mansion, and you're suddenly thrown into a house with predictable and laughable jumpscares, with few bits of story. The story could've been good, if it wasn't delivered horribly. You have to pass boring and annoying puzzles and monsters to progress the story, and it's just not worth it.\n\nAll in all, it's a cash-in on the title of Amnesia. It's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of an amazing horror license, which fell into the wrong hands.\n\nMy final verdict is a 3/10, a game to ignore. If you're a hardcore fan of Frictional Games (like me) you might enjoy bits of it, but overall it's not worth the time, money or effort.","March 16, 2014","false","1.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game is also set in the same dark and twisted universe as the previous one, though in an entirely new time setting and features a new cast. The game features a rich and breathtakingly horrifying story.\n\nWhere the first game took place in Prussia in 1839, the second installment to Amnesia is now set in London 1899 on New Year's Eve. The protagonist, Oswald Mandus, who is a wealthy industrialist and butcher, has returned from an expedition to Mexico and has contracted a fever. At the beginning of the game, Mandus finds himself awakened in his mansion from his fever, which has lasted for several months. Only guided by the voices of his two sons, Enoch and Edwin, Mandus ventures out to find them, all while they lead him deeper into the abysmal depths of London...\nThe story is the main drive behind the game. Exploring the dark underworld of London is a thrilling experience. However, going through the game a 2nd time is less exciting, as all of the mystery will be gone. The replayability of the game is therefore nothing to brag about.\n\nControl & Gamplay:\nAmnesia is a first person game, where the main goal is to explore and delve deeper into a frightening world, and survive. You are armed with nothing but a lantern, thus rendering you utterly helpless should you be confronted with the horrors that await you. Therefore, running and hiding are your only options. This is one of the defining elements of the game. Being unable to defend yourself, you feel constantly threatened, danger lurks behind every corner and you are always on your toes, ready to run away and hide and beg god the thing chasing you doesn't find you.\n\nThe game itself is not difficult. The real challenge is in actually daring to advance further in the game before you get another heart attack. There are no real puzzles as in the previous Amnesia game, which is a shame. The "puzzles" that are present are very obvious and annoying. For the most part, the controls are good. However, when you have to use the few items in the game, the controls can feel clunky and difficult to coordinate.\n\nGraphics:\nThe visual aspect of the game is not impressive. However, the slightly dated graphics create a more gloomy and sinister atmosphere that fits very well with the overall mood of the game.\n\nSound:\nThe soundtrack is my favourite aspect of the game. It is deep and melancholic and it fits the dark and twisted mood of the game.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game offers hours of horror, mystery and heart attacks. Amnesia is a horrifying and exciting universe that must be experienced, especially under the cover of night and preferably all alone. However, in light of its predecessor, The Dark Descent, this game offers little new in terms of mechanics and features. The puzzles feel little more than inconvenient stops in the progression and they have been unnecessarily simplified. On the other hand, the story plays a more significant role, as it often comes across as eluding and perplexing. Thus, even after the credits have rolled, Amnesia will keep you pondering about what exactly has occurred throughout the course of the game.\n\nFor both old and new players to the Amnesia universe there is a twisted, yet compelling, story in wait, which is definitely worth the money.\n\nScore: 8/10","April 20, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And in many ways stories do sell, just look at the Telltale Games' "Walking Dead" game. However people were expecting a game that "one ups" the previous game, Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It doesn't as far as scare factor goes, however it makes up in story. With that being said, be sure to buy this on a steam sale. It's worth atleast $10, maybe $15.\n\nGameplay is lacking, it’s definantly a step back from the previous game in that department. And the previous one wasn't particularly scary either. At least they tried however! There are some moments in this game where the level was seemingly designed for patrolling monster areas. It’s confusing!  Also the puzzles, which were also not hard in the first one, were laughable in the second. Really they were not puzzles, just impediments for your "walking sim" (see tags). With a grain of salt however it isn't particularly bad, the setting gives a lot of flavor and variety. Making the walking trip a little bit more enjoyable.\n\nThe "H. P. Lovecraftian" story and setting are top-notch; it's very disturbing, tragic, and contemplative. If only stories could sell alone. Clearly you don't need a good one in the case of "Outlast," great gameplay with genuine moments that can make you jump. However the story is... well... let’s just hope that the prequel DLC will have a good one. Although in retrospect the comparison between the two games is like comparing a campy movie and a book in the horror genre section. Getting back to Amnesia. Some of exposition in the pages in game probably should have been addressed in dialogue. There are needlessly vague plot points which are very relevant on how this came about and link directly to the previous Amnesia title. There are a group of people out there who ignore this exposition (A few sentences are just too much for them unfortunately). The dialogue does needlessly beats around the bush at times as well.\n\nGraphics; are not all that impressive. Lot of little details, but some of the textures are not great, clothe seems to be a particular problem. But then again this category was never a selling point, it is enough that it creates a level of immersion that doesn't take you out of the moment. The running movements however for some of the models were a bit clunky. Primarily because of how they were shaped (it just doesn't look like they were meant to run).\n\nThe music is also good and very memorable in the parts they were used.  Although there was this moment when the music was too good and didn't fit with the clunky movements on screen (The "Mors Praematura" and London scene, this scene really shows the graphical limitations of running models). The voice acting was very good also, even though were some lines late in the game which were a bit rusty in execution. But I am just being nit-picky in that regard. It is enough that you can sympathize with Mandus in his tragic quest.\n\nOverall Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs leaves much to be desired in gameplay, but the gameplay isn't particular bad. The story was good enough for me to recommend this title. It’s that good. Not to overhype it or anything, but when this game hits a steam sale… buy it, the journey into the depths of despair and desperation is worth it.","March 24, 2014","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is a first person interactive novel/film experience. There are no guns or weapons or inventory system and, honestly, this "experience" doesn't need such features ("experience" seems a better description than "game").  The developers have thought outside the box and created a brilliant work of entertainment that doesn't need to conform to the norms.  You'll have a thoroughly enjoyable (and sometimes disturbing) adventure.\n\nThis really shouldn't be thought of as "Amnesia 2".  You should probably look elsewhere if you want an Amnesia sequel.  This is more like a "mod" of Amnesia to create a different type of product.\n\nThe graphics, sound and environment are immersive. Set your gamma low and turn your sound up and get ready to be swept away in the adventure.  It's not super scary but it's certainly enough to bring a smile and chuckle after a fright scene.\n\nThe gore and blood is relatively tame but (personally) I wouldn't recommend this one for children or people of a sensitive disposition (although "scariness" is a subjective thing).\n\nA very worthy successor to Dear Esther.  The Chinese Room have done it again.  A royal shame that their next game "Everybody's Gone to the Rapture" will be exclusively Sony PS4.\n\nAn excellent game if you've adjusted your expectations:\n- not horror, but it is tense\n- not a traditional FPS game, but it is thoroughly entertaining\n\nEDIT: Still fun to replay many months later.","December 5, 2013","true","6.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

In this game, unlike the dark descent, you don't have to be sparesome with fuel for the lantern, nor do what you can to keep sane, there's no such thing really as picking items up and keeping them in your inventory, such as keys you'd find, pick up and with them unlock doors to progress, in this game, where you need to go is already open... not to mention, you can't really sidetrack because if you try, you'll find that all the doors you're not supposed to go through, will be locked.. I was expecting greatness from this game, being the sequel to the dark descent if I'm not entirely mistaken, but after playing through it, I must say it fell short... the game felt short, was not quite as scary, even if sometimes very eerie in a way, but that's more around me not being a huge fan of steaming-engine sounds basically :) To sum it up, this game feels like a reply to people who have played The Dark Descent, complaining about it being "too hard" or "too obscure".. it feels like the game is made as a very much easier version than it's prequel.. Things I felt whilst playing the game, which kept coming back for several reasons is mainly disappointment, honestly... the game could've been so much more if it only kept some of the core elements of the dark descent, such as an inventory, keys/other "ulocking" items, fuel for the light source, whichever kind you'd like, and a health+sanity tracker etc. Unlike the dark descent this game felt very linear, never really branched off where you could pick where to go, what to get first of the x number of items you needed to progress etc.. If you're looking for a good horror game, or have played the dark descent, and are thinking about getting this one aswell, I'd say you'd be better off getting/sticking to Amnesia: The Dark Descent and leave this one be, since it's more a dissapointment in comparison to TDD, than it is enjoyable in and off of itself.. Sadly that's how I'm going to have to lable this game.","May 16","false","9.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The removed Oil and Tenderbox pick ups, which means infinite light source from your lanturn and to me that took some of the fun away because you didnt have to use them sparingly. The inventory menu they took out, so no pick ups even for important items so you had to drag them clear back across some areas, Also couldn't check your sanity (Because they basically took it out).

However, just because I mentioned that, it doesn't mean the game will be considered as bad than first one. You can easily tell from the title of the first game that it's a game of action and adventure. The Dark Descent..... oooooohh! Imagine about it... it's like you're descending somewhere dark and spooky and there will definitely be something there that'll haunt your skin. For A Machine for Pigs, it's a little different. The crazy hide n' seek and the cats n' mice frenzy we love about The Dark Descent faded a little after your escape from the descent. You're done with that no-living place. It's history, end of story. Now, how 'bout let's start a new century? A brighter one perhaps, not too dark or too overwhelming or trying to kill ourselves in horror wandering in the dungeons.... Maybe in a hungry city or a big mansion with a factory? We can also find more about the past or connection between Daniel and Alexander of Brennenburg. Won't that be an interesting adventure?\n\nThe important thing about A Machine for Pigs is its story, its connection with the previous game, its history and new generation. Just because it doesn't have a lot of monster hit and run doesn't mean it's bad or boring imo. I think the gameplay, the story and the atmosphere is very very beautiful and well done. They fit well. I just love it, same with Dear Esther and Outlast. In any game, gamers should be advised to focus on both the story and the gameplay, not just one of them as it'll be biased.\n\nA Machine for Pigs does have action though, but not a lot as the previous one. There are some parts in this game where you have to be quick as possible, or those damn pigmen will catch your a$$. It can be scary and uncomfortable too in some sticky situations. In the first game, you are most likely exploring in a dungeon and in the dull ancient stoned castle of Brennenburg. Whereas for A Machine for Pigs, you're exploring different rooms, different houses and you're able to roam the city, which is pretty nice.\n\nMost of all, if you're a fan of indie horror games or Amnesia and Frictional Games, then why not try this game out?!? But, if you're a gamer who prefers action-based indie horror games or who doesn't have money, then there's no problem for you to deny getting this game. Your choice mate.\n\nI recommend this game to teenagers, indie horror lovers and people who loves stories.  Also for people who have money xD. I would rate this game 4/5 Stars.\n\nGame motto: Look at it. Think about it. Buy it. Play it. Judge it.","June 26, 2014","true","9.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

That was sort of my first mistake. Having huge expectations after the first game, I sadly had to be let down. This does not mean the game is bad, this just means, that after "The Dark Descent" it probably just had to go downhill. And even though I would love to judge the two games separately, comparing the two is sort inevitable.\n\nOn the up side, I believe the story in this game is way more interesting, heart touching, and creepy at the same time, than the intricate, but slightly… “whatever” story in the first game. It is more personal, and emotional, and the outcome is way more disturbing.\nThe music has definitely left an impression, and I still listen to "Mors Praematura" from time to time, cause the atmosphere it created was divine. Graphics are noticeably better, as the game is a fresher release.\n\nYet, as I moved through the empty house, as I watched Mandus' story unwind, I felt complete peace. And this is not what you want to feel, when playing a horror game. Maybe I have developed a strong resistance to scares, cause of my love for horror, but as hard as the game tried - I just could not get scared.\n\nEven though I love the design of the monsters in this game (whom I will refrain from calling by their name, in case you would rather be surprised), I found it hard to fear them. Found them extremely disturbing, but also had a strong sense of pity for them. They just couldn't get me in the "oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, running away" mode, that the first game had me in most of the time.\n\nAlso the puzzle difficulty in this game is very low, and doesn't require any real thinking skills. Which can be considered an advantage by some, but for me is again, very disappointing.\n\nSo in conclusion, I would suggest playing this game for the interesting story, which left a strong unease in my heart, and the amazing music that stays with you for a long time. But if you are expecting getting really scared, or a good mind boggling puzzle, you will probably be left with a feeling of letdown. All in all, not a bad game, just probably not what you would expect.\n","December 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I loved every single moment of it. Even the parts that weren't very scary.\n\nI played this game all the way through, and I have to say, I was horrified. Was I horrified by monsters constantly chasing me or something jumping out? No, I was not. What horrified me, you ask?\n\nThe plot.\n\nIf you are going in to this game expecting something like The Dark Descent, turn away right away. It is very different from the first. Is that bad? No.\n\nThe game is highly dedicated to telling it's story, which is absolutely horrifying in every detail. It is exactly what the description says it is. It is a game that drags you into the depths of greed, power, and madness.\n\nLooking back at The Dark Descent, it did not have a very good plot. Sure, it worked for the setting of the game and was well written, but for what it actually is, it is rather simple. It did not scare me at all, even with the horrible things it implied. However, the game made up for the uninteresting story with the absolute terror it induced into every one of it's players.\n\nNow lets look at A Machine for Pigs. It has it's scary moments, but it isn't very scary once played all the way through. However, the plot of this game got me hooked, and I wanted to know everything about it. By the end, I was absolutely shocked. The game features a storyline that if you really, truely listen to, will put you at the edge of your seat. It is told in a way that is very vague, and requires you to think.\n\nThe other features of this game are also very well done. The sound design if phenominal. It's so well done that you actually feel like you are descending into a horrible, dark machine. The music is some of the best I have ever heard in a game, and it goes very well with what is going on.\n\nThe game isn't trying to be like The Dark Descent. It wants to be different, and it wants to scare us in a different way.\n\nIf you want something exactly like The Dark Descent, do not buy this game. If you want to be scared in a new way while being told a beautiful story, then this is the game for you.","January 10, 2014","true","5.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

This is a shame really, considering how atmospheric this game really is.\nThe Amnesia HPL game engine succeeds in giving a real sense of weight to the machinery, and together with the sound design it actually manages to fully drag you in at certain moments in the game.\n\nWhat the game lacks is partially some of the gameplay mechanics that made the original Amnesia what it is today. This current system is simplifield, which in a way breaks the sense of helplessness the original game introduced.\nThe game is also extremely linear, which might not necessarily be a bad thing, but compared to the original it feels way too limited and scripted. On the other hand, the way the story is told could have suffered from too much freedom as well.\n\nAll these areas of critique are, however, intensified by this being a successor to what could arguably be, the best and most well designed horror game of all time.\n\nIf you can look past its flaws, this is a short and sweet horror experience that is still one of the better examples of how the genre is presented today.

Without it, games such as Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Dead Space wouldn’t have been so memorable or horrific and would have just been regular games with some creepy zombies and monsters. Fun yes, but not terrifying or enough to keep your blood pumping and your heart racing. But when it comes to atmosphere in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs? This game has it.\n\nFrom the dark and gloomy lighting to the various background noises, or lack thereof at times, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire game. Always expecting something to jump out at me, I traversed through the various rooms of the mansion, factory, sewers, tunnels, and other locations – all of which looks great thanks to the graphics that add little touches such as lighting effects, fog, and debris.\n\nThe story was much better than A Machine for Pigs’ predecessor Amnesia: The Dark Descent, likely due to the collaboration between Frictional Games and Dear Esther developer The Chinese Room. I found it to be more intriguing as I wandered through the game and learned more about the character and the tragic events that transpired. I started to learn more about what had happened to the children and the factory, among other things, as I progressed through a mixture of reading journals, flashbacks, and narrated scenes (where the voice acting was great). These revelations continued to enhance the dark, gloomy, and horrifying atmosphere.\n\nTo read the rest of my review visit Press2Reset: http://press2reset.com/reviews/review-amnesia-a-machine-for-pigs/","November 26, 2013","true","14.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

TDD was more focused on the gameplay and the basic human fears, fear of dying, of the dark, of the unknown, etc.\nAMFP was more focused on the story, it was a psychological kind of horror, the fear of what you would discover, what might have happened.\nThe story of AMFP is very good, the music is beautiful (Jessica Curry did a wonderful job), and the ending... there is no words to describe it.\nSo even though I think TDD is a wonderful game, I enjoyed AMFP a lot more.","January 4","true","5.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The writing through notes scattered about the environment is unbelievably magnificent.  The musical score is also noteworthy and like its predecessor the atmosphere is thick, rich and well maintained throughout.\n\nI'm not going to compare Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs with Amnesia: The Dark Descent as is the rage on the Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs Steam forums and most likely on any gaming forum that your browser may come upon.

The game, as TDD did, has some great mechanics and fun puzzles but it falls short if you have played and finished TDD.\n\nThe ending for me was the killer, it was quite possibly the most repetitive ending I have ever witnessed and I really was not too keen on that either.

The developers, which is The Chinese Room, they have had a much bigger focus on the atmosphere and the surrounding in the game that Frictional Games had, which to me was a good thing.

And it was the same with the puzzles in the game, they were a bit too short and easy from time to time.\n\nTo finish of, I would like to say this game had an excellent story and a very dynamic atmosphere.

That game becomes famous. And then, when a sequel comes out, it’s made simpler, easier and more “accessible”. That’s what happened here.\n\nThe only good things about it are the extraordinary voice acting and the story. The actors knew this was a serious game and took it that way and the story is good enough to keep you from uninstalling before you finish it.\n\nYou no longer have to manage which torches or candles you light up. There’s no more insanity, so you can be in the dark and look at enemies all the time you want. Puzzles are mostly just picking something up and taking it from one place to the other.\n\nThis game is also hardly scary. It only scared me three times in four hours.\nIt doesn’t have many jump scares, but you don’t need them to make a game scary. Some of the things that made the prequel scary were moments like hiding in a room and then, when an enemy entered the room, hoping he wouldn’t look at where you were. Or having an enemy chasing you and you knew you couldn’t outrun it. You had to close doors or setup obstacles on your way. The sequel has none of this.\n\nMy main problem with it is the difficulty. I’ve been playing video games regularly since 1993 (even earlier, if you count electronic games) and this was the very first non-racing/sports/strategy game ever that I finished without dying. And I’m not even that good. Before this, my best survivability record was only dying twice when I finished “Sonic Chaos” for the first time with Tails, when I was a teenager. When I became aware of my “invincibility”, I stopped being afraid of the pigs.\n\n“Amnesia: The Dark Descent” will be known in History as one of the greatest horror games. “Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs” will be a footnote saying there was a sequel. Well, I hope Frictional Games made plenty of money with this use of the Amnesia name.","September 15, 2015","false","4.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The game takes place mostly in factory like setting.\n\n+ The narrative and plot is excellent, journal entries are scattered throughout the game providing pieces of the story. The story touches upon some interesting themes.\n\n+ Light puzzle solving elements to keep things interesting\n\n+The game doesn't overstay its welcome, it is roughly a 4-6 hour experience.\n\n+ The music is excellent and really adds to the overall experience\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game lacks a lot of the terror from the Dark Descent.  Despite the atmosphere, I never really felt threatened in any way. In the entire game there were only a few instances where the enemy would hunt you and even then it was very easy to just out run them to the next area. Part of the problem is that this game heavily streamlined many of the elements from the first game. Death has no consequence, sanity effects gone, refilling the lantern gone... . Many of the things that make the first game so terrifying no longer exist in this game.\n\n- Technically and artistically the game didn't impress me. A lot of the later levels have the 'been there done that' feeling to them. Everything "feels" the same.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is a game of expectations. If you were expecting the gameplay of Dark Descent then you will be disappointed. What you are playing this game for is the atmosphere, exploration and narrative, just don't expect anything more.\n","October 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

It's not good. But looking at the developer that was obvious. The chinese room is amazing at atmosphere and if this game was a cheap short jaunt into the machine it would have been amazing.\n\nThis however?\n\nGot dull. There was almost no thrill to be found, things got old, the enemies were incredibly repetative for how little they actually appeared (One was added at the VERY end, only to be used twice. There were a number of times I could see irritating clipping. The voices, while done well droned on.\n\nOverall, while I LOVED games like Gone Home and Dear Ester, this  game? It was just boring. I KNEW what my character did for the longest time in the game, yet it get droning on about it so I was just left there waiting for the penny to drop.\n\nThere was only...twice where I had anything close to a bit of fear. Once you realise that most areas literally have NO threats to you, you just rush through.\n\nThat's another thing. It's only 5 hours long? A part of what padded out the playtime of the original amnesia was the need to collect oil, tinder and the fun you had when you got bored of just throwing ♥♥♥♥ around. This game has NONE of that. You just move through the levels, no need to explore.\n\nThe most interesting part of this game to me was the very beginning. Exploring the house and discovering more about the characters. As it started to decend into the machine though it, again, got dull.\n\nOne thing that really bugged me is that I REALLY wanted to see the machine properly. To look at it in it's glory but the draw distance on those objects was far too short and I doubt there was much effort in designing something the player wouldn't see.\n\nanother thing was small graphical things. Clipping and noticing spots where textures didn't meet, creating a gap where there was no texture. Yes many games have those and I was willing to look past that but at the very end there were two spots, the convayer belt leading to stairs where your children are constantly appearing in the alcoves, watching you. The  belt clips into the stairs at the end. For such a cinematic part it really killed it for me.\n\nThen, at the end where you get into the chair. It really bugged me that he had no body, EVEN then. It was the very end of the game and you only had one thing left to do. Yet you were just a floating camera, no body, no anything. AND then when those arms come down they clip through a part of the console you just used.\n\nOverall it just didn't feel like fun or worth the time I put into it.","August 22, 2015","false","5.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Between the design of the eponymous Machine and the incredible sound design, "A Machine for Pigs" does a fantastic job of creating a tense, oppressive environment as you wander the vast, claustrophobic passages of the groaning behemoth.\n\nSo with the understanding that any sense of actual fear (though not unease, by far) will evaporate after about the third Manpig encounter, and that the game isn't that much longer than a Peter Jackson film, I still recommend giving this game a try.","June 1, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sound and voice acting are first class. The atmosphere is very creepy, gloomy, and scary. My heart was beating and I jumped many times during the game. There are problems to solve (puzzles) lots of thinking to do. Some are quite difficult, and you never know what exactly is going on here. Is it a nightmare ? is this man insane ? Is the whole world insane ? Slowly but surely you are given notes, recordings, and journal entries to help somewhat. I enjoyed every minute of this game, which lasted about 14 hours. My hats off to the Chinese Room for making another masterpiece. I highly recommend A Machine For Pigs to anyone who enjoys thinking about our world, and the human condition. Anyone who has no knowledge of the Industrial Revolution working conditions, Child Labor Laws, Life at the turn of the 20th century, right before the slaughter of WW1, wont enjoy this game, because they won't understand it.

The Chinese Room masterfully uses the sound and ambience of this world to create a spine tingling adventure that isn't so much a "Scared to go into the next room" experience, but creates a general nervousness about what's going to happen next.\n\nThis is one of those games where, if you took off the "Amnesia" from the title, it would have been much more critically acclaimed as a worthy successor to Dear Esther.

Although conceptially disturbing, no sense of horror is felt beyond the first hour of the game once you meet the pigs. There's something about them, something I can define that just renders them unscary, whether it is because of the stripped out Sanity mechanic that deters you from glaring at the bacon-on-legs as it squeels fall hallow and its strike inflict enough damage to perhaps dent a spoon, or the concept that these creatures are not hunting you like the grunt of Amnesia: The Dark Decent, they just don't work. The narrative is perhaps the only thing I can recommend but even that is convoluted and (forgive the pun) ham-handed in its delivery. The idea is sound and if you are more into interactive fiction in the way of stopping every two seconds to read the story out of a journal then go ahead but for me, the point that the story no longer held weight was when a teleporting 'tesla pig' popped out its snout. I wish I was joking. So yeah, not the worst thing in the world but it definitely trots over the IP with mud stained hoofs, really just look up the machine for pigs ending by rapid retrospect to get the cool payoff monologue instead of slogging through a confusing yet not complex enough story that doesn't make a good use of its videogame platform.

Having played 'Dear Esther' (also from Chinese Room), I noticed the similarity that the game focuses largely on the narrative and their excellent ability to tell a story that can almost be classified as virtual literature. This causes the game to lose some ground in the interactive part. In itself I don't find this to be a negative point, since too much interactivity can interrupt the flow of a game if not done properly, but I expected the game to have the same balance between scary moment, storyline and interactivity as The Dark Descent. And I think that is the reason why the reviews might be a bit more negative than they might have been if it wasn't so closely related to the Dark Descent. If you can set aside your expectation for the game and play it with an open mind, you're in for a treat.\n\nThe game is short, for me it was about 5 hours. Thing is, if a game lacks interactivity or the story loses its pace, it might be a good thing to not have the game taking 10 hours. While the story might be good, you don't want to get the reputation that folks want to finish your horror game to see how it ends, but are bored throughout it instead of scared stiff every once in a while. So all in all 5 hours is a good time for a decent horror game.\n\nCatch the game on a sale if you want the money to match the amount of game time (I have this arbitrary rule that 1€ = 1h game time to make it worth my while, but that's just my idiosyncrasy).\n\nFinal verdict: Play it without expecting it to be like The Dark Descent and you will have about 5 hours of good creepy fun.","July 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ending is a bit "neh" due to that. I would not call it a sad, scary or intense game at all. It's alright by means that it has a plot.\n\nThe engine is the same as the previous game with some new objects added.\n\nThe scariest thing for me was properly the trophy room, which you probably will understand why if you see it.\n\nThe game is not worth the 12 euro I gave for it for the story and graphics, but I'm sure it's worth the effort the developer put into it, considering the game is almost a year late!\n\nIf you like scary games, then this is probably not the game for you. It concentrates on instant shocks rather than atmosphere. It lacks the ambience in most parts of the game, but you are able to hear the soundtracks in the rather important parts.\n\nLots of puzzles, but they are easy enough to figure out.\n\nThe game is VERY metaphorically! Basically everything is considered a metaphor for something else, so beware of that!\n\nMy recommendation for the game:\n6/10\nThe story is not horrible, but it misses out on some points, and is very predictable. It's not a Frictional Game production and you can clearly feel the difference, however if you want to check it an almost scary game, then this is probably the right for you.\nAmbience could be better by creating an atmosphere instead of just listening to the sounds of the machine.","September 13, 2013","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before I go on, I will start by saying this is an excellent game in its own right, and it is very much worth playing, the vast majority of my concerns for this game stem from comparing it to it's predecessor. But more on that in a moment.\n\nWhat I liked about A Machine for Pigs:\nThe music. Music in games is always a big factor for me, and this soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I adore Jessica Curry, and her work here is just as well-crafted as in Dear Esther. It absolutely defines the atmosphere, and complements everything going on in the game wonderfully.\n\nThe atmosphere. Very, very well-done. The game starts in a very domestic atmosphere, which has it's own nightmarish qualities, and eventually segues into this vast demonic machine complex which is confusing and oppressive, and I love it. Very dark, very tense, very good.\n\nThe plot and themes (mostly). [POTENTIAL SPOILERS] The plot of this game draws a lot on the concepts of the first. Self-induced amnesia, in an attempt to undo the unspeakable deeds the protagonist has committed, nothing new. But it is the context in which this is done that sets it wildly apart. Whereas the first game has the protagonist a victim, slowly turned psychotic in his work, this one has the protagonist as a monster on such a larger scale. The themes of industrialization and dehumanization are fascinating, and portrayed in very unnerving and gut-wrenching modes. I say that I mostly liked the plot, however, because I am utterly baffled by the ending. Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but I just did not understand it at all. I feel like there was some huge twist and it was completely lost on me.\n\nWhat I did not like:\nOther elements of the plot [VAGUE SPOILERS CONTINUE] were poorly delivered, jarring, or incredibly predictable. Twists and revelations fell flat because you had seen them coming from ten miles away. I'm not sure if the character of Mandus is in massive denial or if he's just that dense sometimes, at the repetition of certain elements of the story. Overall the story really felt incomplete.[END SPOILERS]\n\nRemoval of literally every gameplay element from the first game. Your lamp is unlimited, tinderboxes are not a thing that exists, you have no health or sanity bar. I think the sanity thing is the worst offender. There is now no consequence for looking at monsters, which destroys half of their menace, there is no consequence for sitting around in the dark the whole time. And now that your health regenerates, there;s really no sense of desperation if you come away from a creature encounter poorly.\n\nThe horror. It was weak at best. I was infinitely more unnerved by the themes, setdressing, and practices of Mandus' processing plant than I was by any of the game's overt attempts to scare me. I think the moment I realized this was going to be disappointing in the horror department was my first concrete encounter with a monster. I saw it turning a corner and I froze and put my lamp away, all well and good, got the adrenaline flowing just like old times, but then I go down to where it is, and after hiding in the corner trying to get past it, it sees me, chases me into a dead end, and proceeds to..... do nothing? I'm not sure if this was scripted so that your first encounter with a monster was tense but safe, or if it was just a glitch. Either way it ruined the scariness of the monsters from then out.Even after that though, the monsters are unresponsive, slow, and generally less than terrifying. There were a few moments of true terror in this game, but they were few and far between, and not due to the monsters at all.\n\nOverall, I have some very saddened disappointment toward this game. I expected it to be everything the first was, if not more, and that was my mistake.\nRegardless, it is an excellent game, especially viewed in it's own light and not in comparison to it's precursor.\n7/10","September 12, 2013","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

However, I feel that the game isn't about that. Although I have not played Dark Descent, I still believe that this game was successful in freaking the crap out of me. The developers of this game do not establish horror through jump scares and immediate danger, but rather through the atmosphere which makes the game feel like you are always in danger. The story was excellent and extremely original and overall I highly recommend buying it. The extensive story also makes it interesting to play with friends  and the overall experience has made me a fan of the franchise.

Do you like horror? Get this. Do you like great story? Get this. Do you like somewhat puzzle based adventure-ish games? You should probably maybe get this too.\nWhat a great game. What a terrifying game. What a great experience. One of the most intriguingly macabre stories I have seen in a game. The beauty of this is that, okay, Amnesia, The Dark Descent's story was fantastic, but (BUT) it fell short because there was so much fantasy involved, and the ending was a bit lacklustre. That said, I still LOVE Amnesia, The Dark Descent. However, A Machine for Pigs' story feels much more close to home, which makes it a lot more unsettling. Granted, there's quite a bit of the supernatural involved, but it still felt more relateable, and the ending... OOOOOOH THE ENDING was so good.\nThey removed some mechanics, and I will list them. And my opinion. They removed the inventory (Good, I'm happy, that wasn't terrifying it was just annoying as hell), they removed the oil management for the lamp, but made it more of a flashlight (Neutral feeling on this. The oil really added a factor to the terror, but on the other hand, the flickery and jumpy flashlight makes it just as horrifying to that end. Shortens your field of vision, and is just altogether unsettling.), and they removed the insanity system (I am really upset about this. This was a HUGE part of The Dark Descent), all in favor of improved admosphere and dialogue, so in many ways it works in its favor.\n\nLike I said, if you enjoy Horror games, or games with fascinating stories, pick this up.","January 12, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Two, I still absolutely recommend it.\n\nWhile "A Machine For Pigs" fails in the same places its predecessor did (lack of variety in the monsters chief among them, there being a grand total of four enemies in this game, two of which make very limited appearances and two of which I had to check the wiki to even learn they were seperate creatures), and even in some new ways (no need to manage light supply, puzzles are reduced mostly to "press the button" or "put the thing in the thing and then press the button"), it makes up for it in atmosphere. Between the design of the eponymous Machine and the incredible sound design, "A Machine for Pigs" does a fantastic job of creating a tense, oppressive environment as you wander the vast, claustrophobic passages of the groaning behemoth.\n\nSo with the understanding that any sense of actual fear (though not unease, by far) will evaporate after about the third Manpig encounter, and that the game isn't that much longer than a Peter Jackson film, I still recommend giving this game a try.","June 1, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ending is a bit "neh" due to that. I would not call it a sad, scary or intense game at all. It's alright by means that it has a plot.\n\nThe engine is the same as the previous game with some new objects added.\n\nThe scariest thing for me was properly the trophy room, which you probably will understand why if you see it.\n\nThe game is not worth the 12 euro I gave for it for the story and graphics, but I'm sure it's worth the effort the developer put into it, considering the game is almost a year late!\n\nIf you like scary games, then this is probably not the game for you. It concentrates on instant shocks rather than atmosphere. It lacks the ambience in most parts of the game, but you are able to hear the soundtracks in the rather important parts.\n\nLots of puzzles, but they are easy enough to figure out.\n\nThe game is VERY metaphorically! Basically everything is considered a metaphor for something else, so beware of that!\n\nMy recommendation for the game:\n6/10\nThe story is not horrible, but it misses out on some points, and is very predictable. It's not a Frictional Game production and you can clearly feel the difference, however if you want to check it an almost scary game, then this is probably the right for you.\nAmbience could be better by creating an atmosphere instead of just listening to the sounds of the machine.","September 13, 2013","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Machine for pigs is less scary, more linear, and if anything a bit uglier perhaps. Yet I still recommend it if for nothing else that it still maintains the Amnesia atmosphere, and I actually like the story better than that of Dark Descent.\n\nLong Stroy Short:\nCons:\n-Runs like crap, game doesn't look very good, and I had to set it back to low to even eek out 20 fps (and I meet the recommended reqs)\n-Very, very linear. If you enjoyed the open-ended "search for the thingy to open the door" gameplay of Dark Descent, then Pigs will sorely disappoint you. It's basically move through the area to the end, avoid a monster sometimes.\n-Pretty short, finished the whole game in 3.8 hours, but Dark Descent was about that long too.\n\nPros:\n-Great atmosphere, and an interesting setting to boot, much better than some haunted castle as with Dark Descent.\n-Really enjoyed the story, Dark Descent got kinda convuluted and weird towards the end, and I really liked Pigs story. No complaints there.\n\nTLDR; Buy on sale unless you really really want more Amnesia, otherwise, wait till on sale. Enjoyable experience overall.

Before I go on, I will start by saying this is an excellent game in its own right, and it is very much worth playing, the vast majority of my concerns for this game stem from comparing it to it's predecessor. But more on that in a moment.\n\nWhat I liked about A Machine for Pigs:\nThe music. Music in games is always a big factor for me, and this soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I adore Jessica Curry, and her work here is just as well-crafted as in Dear Esther. It absolutely defines the atmosphere, and complements everything going on in the game wonderfully.\n\nThe atmosphere. Very, very well-done. The game starts in a very domestic atmosphere, which has it's own nightmarish qualities, and eventually segues into this vast demonic machine complex which is confusing and oppressive, and I love it. Very dark, very tense, very good.\n\nThe plot and themes (mostly). [POTENTIAL SPOILERS] The plot of this game draws a lot on the concepts of the first. Self-induced amnesia, in an attempt to undo the unspeakable deeds the protagonist has committed, nothing new. But it is the context in which this is done that sets it wildly apart. Whereas the first game has the protagonist a victim, slowly turned psychotic in his work, this one has the protagonist as a monster on such a larger scale. The themes of industrialization and dehumanization are fascinating, and portrayed in very unnerving and gut-wrenching modes. I say that I mostly liked the plot, however, because I am utterly baffled by the ending. Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but I just did not understand it at all. I feel like there was some huge twist and it was completely lost on me.\n\nWhat I did not like:\nOther elements of the plot [VAGUE SPOILERS CONTINUE] were poorly delivered, jarring, or incredibly predictable. Twists and revelations fell flat because you had seen them coming from ten miles away. I'm not sure if the character of Mandus is in massive denial or if he's just that dense sometimes, at the repetition of certain elements of the story. Overall the story really felt incomplete.[END SPOILERS]\n\nRemoval of literally every gameplay element from the first game. Your lamp is unlimited, tinderboxes are not a thing that exists, you have no health or sanity bar. I think the sanity thing is the worst offender. There is now no consequence for looking at monsters, which destroys half of their menace, there is no consequence for sitting around in the dark the whole time. And now that your health regenerates, there;s really no sense of desperation if you come away from a creature encounter poorly.\n\nThe horror. It was weak at best. I was infinitely more unnerved by the themes, setdressing, and practices of Mandus' processing plant than I was by any of the game's overt attempts to scare me. I think the moment I realized this was going to be disappointing in the horror department was my first concrete encounter with a monster. I saw it turning a corner and I froze and put my lamp away, all well and good, got the adrenaline flowing just like old times, but then I go down to where it is, and after hiding in the corner trying to get past it, it sees me, chases me into a dead end, and proceeds to..... do nothing? I'm not sure if this was scripted so that your first encounter with a monster was tense but safe, or if it was just a glitch. Either way it ruined the scariness of the monsters from then out.Even after that though, the monsters are unresponsive, slow, and generally less than terrifying. There were a few moments of true terror in this game, but they were few and far between, and not due to the monsters at all.\n\nOverall, I have some very saddened disappointment toward this game.

I honestly feel bad that Frictional games allowed this title to be released under the Amnesia banner because this just does not live up to the original Amnesia. The sense of horror and complete helplessness that the original had is close to nonexistent in A Machine for Pigs. It is also significantly shorter.\n\nThere is basically zero gameplay elements because the inventory has been removed and the enemies in the game which you are supposed to be weary of are few and far between. The Dark Descent also had two central "hub" areas which you could explore around, as to not make the game linear. A Machine for Pigs is COMPLETELY linear and there are basically zero puzzles. The "puzzles" are literally just flip a few switches and move on. That's it. Super dissappointing. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the game warns you ahead of time when anything out of the ordinary is going to happen by making the lights flicker and your lamp flickers. What is the point of making a horror game when you cue the player into knowing EXACTLY when and where the scary moments are? The design just doesn't make sense.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it is overly symbolic and never really draws you in. I feel like the story relies on making you care about the events which are occurring, yet it never does anything to make you care about the events. The best analogy I can make is the story feels like a nightly news broadcast about some random story that you don't care about.\n\nVerdict: Skip this waste of time and play the original Amnesia.\n\nA Machine for Pigs takes about 5 hours to complete.\n\n4/10\n\nPlease upvote this review if you found it useful :)","January 1, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, some of the environments and machinery looks very good. But really, I just finished it and I'd be really hard pressed to come up with anything else. And both those come with a hitch or two. The story isn't engaging until it's been built and fails to deliver on the whole "Amnesia" aspect. And the game is horribly optimized so you can't really enjoy anything when it comes to the graphics or gameplay. Perhaps I was the unlucky one with the perfectly wrong setup but I could not get this game to avoid frame rate drop offs (big ones) on any graphic settings at all. At least 30mins of my gameplay time is adjusting settings. No matter how low and small or how high and big I went the frame rate got beat in to the ground at random spots. And thus detracted from the already shallow gameplay and the pleasant environment visuals. But while this was the most glaring and annoying issue, I can't say my review would change much if the frame rate was a steady 60FPS.\n\nNothing drew me in. You walk. You run. You climb a ladder here and there. You pull a lever. The gameplay is as shallow as it gets. You never have to think or complete a puzzle. You can only interact with what you need and usually its just a couple feet away from where it goes. There's absolutely no mystery as to where you're going or what you should do. Just no confusion at all, no "Amnesia" if you will. While the environments look great there's a lack of atmosphere built. Maybe the sound is just average? Maybe the special effects are lacking? I do not know, but it just lacked the atmosphere the first game created as a whole. An hour in I was already looking forward to the end as it began to feel like a tedious chore even though it wasn't really tedious. If that makes sense haha... I just couldn't get drawn in. There was no intensity or panic. I never felt threatened. Even when enemies have a rare appearance in the game a little jog in a circle around an object will buy you the time you need. Just no threats in the game at all.\n\nAs a standalone game it doesn't offer much at all and as a sequel it is downright awful. I applaud the effort and was able to enjoy some late game moments as things built up in a grand way and the story was more valuable than gameplay. But as someone who just enjoyed Amnesia: The Dark Descent I couldn't be more disappointed in Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs.\n\nThrow an absolutely atrocious price tag on top all of this and I can comfortably tell you to avoid this game.","December 18, 2014","false","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is very little 'horror' in the game itself. The Dark Descent was terrifying, it scared me so bad I could only play the game in half hour bursts at max.

But that does not make up for the lack of pure terror you felt as the chase music screamed at you (A Machine for Pigs has no real chase music) when you were being chased by a monster like what happened in the Dark Descent. A Machine for Pigs simplifies much of the gameplay from the Dark Descent. You have an unlimited light source (which I feel takes away from the fear as well as you never need to worry about running out of light), simpler puzzles, no sanity meter (arguably better, arguably not) and no inventory.\n\nA Machine for Pigs has great atmosphere, the plot is intriguing, but the horror elements that made the Dark Descent great just aren't there - and it's a huge disappointment.","July 11, 2014","false","7.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For my part, I really enjoyed this one, even if it made some noticable changes to the way the game plays.\n\nIn this new Amnesia, you will no longer have to manage resources.  The inventory and sanity systems are gone, and your latern never runs out of fuel (it does flicker however, when enemies are nearby, which is a good touch).  Personally, I don't mind any of these changes because it fits the style that A Machine for Pigs is going for.  It wants to be a more brooding and atmospheric game with a bigger focus on the story, and forcing you to deal with sanity and the like would be counterproductive.\n\nBut despite that, there is one change I cannot understand: the limitation of physical interaction with your environment.  In the first game, you could pick up many different objects lying around the environment and toss them around.  Aside from helping with puzzle solving, it was a good way to immerse you in your surroundings.  But in A Machine for Pigs, many of the objects you see are just static, which bothers me especially because there's sometimes no good logic for which ones can or cannot be interacted with.\n\nEven so, I could recommend this game based solely on the environment and story alone.  The environment is awesome.  The rumble of an giant unearthly machine spinning to life below your feet and shaking the mansion you start the game in is something to truly behold.  The various steampunk influences on the environment are clearly visible, especially later in the game as you start going underground.  The story is also something to behold.  Compared to the first game, the story of A Machine for Pigs is probably its strongest point.  It's a twisted tale of loss, redemption, madness, and hits on some themes you probably won't see coming.  After completing the game, I couldn't get it out of my head for weeks.  It may start slow, but the final hour of the game is worth it (the entire game took me five hours or so to beat).  It's a tale of psychological horror you won't soon forget.\n\nThe implications of being a sequel to what many call the scariest game ever made are big.  A Machine for Pigs may not be the Amnesia sequel many people wanted, but as a game in its own right it stands as something incredibly deep and thought-provoking.  The gameplay may not be as complicated as the original, but the story and atmosphere are both incredible experiences.  Playing the first game is not required to enjoy the story, although there are some references you won't understand if you haven't played it, and it definitely gives certain things a new context.  My final verdict: recommended for those with an open-mind and a love for complex and thought-provoking stories.\n\n","January 8, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The fear and anxiety caused by The Dark Descent is replaced by an unlimitted supply of light and mental clarity. The game itself often feels more laid back and common place.

This is mostly due to my own mental anticipation which proves to be wasted effort in and of itself. In spite of this, I cannot seem to put down the game.

The extent of the 'puzzles' in Machine for Pigs is finding the correct lever and giving it a swift tug. There, puzzle complete. Unlike the previous Amnesia game you cannot pick up in game objects other than chairs in a few areas. The developers disabled the ability to pick up objects - very hastily I might add, as you can still knock things over with chairs and easily cause other "nailed down" props to glitch out. Throughout the game the ambience tries to be spooky but due to the limitations of the game there is no sense of danger. When you are confronted with the monsters you'll laugh or even stare with your eyes half-open at the pathetic excuse of a threat. They are slow and give you plenty of opportunity to run away, and its not very hard to just walk around them when they see you. The new 'lamp' in the game flickers to notify you when a monster is near, which might've worked in a game like FEAR when the atmosphere and the script were above average, but not in a poorly written, poorly built game like this. They took out the paranoia features that the first game had, as well as the tinderboxes and lamp oil. The player doesn't even have any health potions, or any item to retrieve for that matter, which means there's no reason to explore the map other than to look for scraps of paper with sappy dialogue. I expected this game to be an excellent addition to the Amnesia universe, but TheChineseRoom failed in every possible way to make this game worthy of its title. Might've been better if it was designed as a standalone game instead of being directly related to Amnesia. (Note: same universe sequel, not story continuing sequel. Barely any crossovers. Absolutely no reason to have Amnesia in the title.)\n\nI really hope TheChineseRoom learns from their mistakes with this game.","November 25, 2013","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you are not familiar with that game, its basically an interactive novel, which could also be said of Amnesia: AMFP. The problem with this type of game is that it isn't scary!\n\nI played Amnesia:TDD and loved it and I waited a year to play AMFP. I read the reviews, both good and bad, and I knew that this game didn't play the same way as TDD, so I wasn't really expecting a sequel to that game. I was ready to play AMFP as its own game and I desperately wanted to love it. However, regardless of how you look at it, whether you compare it to Amnesia: TDD or you take it as its own game, Amnesia: AMFP is neither scary nor fun.\n\nFirst, let me talk about the gameplay: It's extremely simplistic. The primary point of the game is to turn on/off a giant machine or factory. You would think this would offer a lot of opportunities for organic puzzles as you figure out how to operate a complex machine that you have no memory of creating, right? WRONG. I was never confused about what I was expected to do because the game is extremely linear and usually the switch your are supposed to flip is the ONLY switch you can touch! To make matters worse, whenever you enter a new area, you get a journal entry telling you exactly what you are supposed to do, even though you will already know because it's so obvious.\n\nThe second part of the gameplay is avoiding the pigs, which are the main "monsters" in the game. The pig monsters were absolutely terrible for two big reasons: 1) they are NOT scary, and 2) they have terrible AI and are extremely easy to avoid. Every time I entered a new area I attempted to find good hiding places in case the pig monsters would appear, but 80% of the time it was unnecessary because they wouldn't show. That is probably the worst aspect of the game: you rarely ever see the pigs. The few occasions in which you do, they are stupid easy to avoid and don't even kill you instantly, so you can actually run away from them while taking damage and escape!\n\nThe other element of the game that matters is the story. The story is comprised of documents found throughout the game as well as "visions" or scary moments that you have in-game. The creepiest part of the game is your character's two children, which appear and do creepy stuff every now and again. Everything else, just isn't scary. The pig's are scary for about the first 30 minutes of the game and after that, you just get used to what they look like. The storyline makes very little sense and your character's motivations are unclear. It is hard to give an example without spoiling, but the best I can give is the pigs themselves. It is extremely unclear why the pig mosnters exist and what the purpose for their creation is. Ostensibly, they are supposed to kill people, but the giant machine already does that on its own, so why the pigs? This question is never fully answered and even after going on the wiki and reading the full explanation, it still makes no sense.\n\nOverall, I was completely devastated by how completely bland, boring, and uninspired this game was. If there is a third game in the works, they need to keep The Chinese Room far away from it!","November 29, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However in my opion this did not make it any less of a fantastic game, but the concept and the way the game played was very different to the first one. While the first game involved a lot of puzzles and hiding from monsters A Machine for Pigs features very little of either of these events. In fact the game features very little gameplay at all and instead becomes very cinematic and story focused with a large emphasis on finding and reading notes and audio recordings. This may sound boring, however I found this game to have a better storyline and the way it way told was also better in my opinion, but I won't speak of the details to avoid potential spoilers. The sountrack for the game is very good and immersive, but it tends to aid in the feel and mood of the game and helps tell the story unlike The Dark Decent where it often makes the atmosphere seem more tense and spooky. The visuals in this game a very much the same as The Dark Decent, however I felt that it looked slightly better in High Definition than The Dark Decent did but this may just be me and not actually a truth. It is also about the same length as The Dark Decent although may possibly be shorter for some players (5-6 hours). But for the price I feel that this game is well worth playing if you enjoyed The Dark Decent or story driven games, or maybe simply horror fans. 79/100","January 9, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That may not be obvious, since I got the retail version instead of the steam version. Hopefully, the high expectations that I had for Machine for Pigs coming off of The Dark Descent did not hurt my experience, though it will definitely affect this review.\n\nI'll be blunt here, I was disappointed to see that the threat of the darkness was gone. I mean, the lantern flickering effect is nice, but without the sanity dropping in the dark, and without the threat of running out of oil, it felt like a big piece of what made the original Amnesia so great was lost. The little parts where your eyes adjust to the darkness was so helpful to navigation, but it was lost here. The lack of an inventory was also dissapointing. But the lack of the sanity meter was the worst part.\n\nHowever, the game was still well worth the money. The music was excellent. In fact, it outmatched the original. The enemies were terrifying, but usually not annoying to escape from. (looking at you Kaernk). I still felt very much immersed in yet another dark storyline, though it felt like one of the big twists was made known too early. The connection between the two main characters helped add weight the story, just as it did during the first game. And the dark efforts of the characters towards their goal was just as chilling as the original Amnesia. Stepping into the outdoors was also a major plus for this game.\n\nAll in all, was it as good as the original? No. Too many of the mechanics that made the original great were removed. It felt stripped-down, sort of.  No sanity bar. No tinderbox conservation. No inventory. No lantern oil.\n\nBut do I still recommend it as an excellent horror game? Yes. It stil has the immersion and the horror that made the original great.","January 4, 2014","true","16.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yes this is a different experience and yes sometimes it's not as visually terrifying as a title such as Outlast or the original Amnesia, but you can't confuse "Different" with "Worse" to paraphrase rockpapershotgun's review.

However, i did played The Chinese Room's previous game, Dear Ester, and thought it was pretty good. Now, A Machine for Pigs really isn't that scary. I played basically the entire campaign with headphones on and the lights off to amplify the horror, and honestly, there were only a few times it really scared me. But, that is not the main reason to play this game. A lot of people would say to play this game for the story, and while the story is good, it is pretty hard to follow at points. Important notes and journal entries are written in what seems like old english and at times can be hard to understand, but the basics are always there and you will pretty much have an idea what is going on as you make your way through the factory. The main reason i recommend this game is the atmosphere. It is a dark and dreary victorian-esq setting which works perfectly while traversing with solely an oil lamp. the mansion is looming and the factory is durty and desperate. The Chinese Room knows how important atmosphere can be in games like these and they really outdid themselves. Secondly, the level design is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. There is so much potential to get lost in games like these, with dark corners and hallways everywhere. But somehow no matter how much i strayed and thought i turned myself around, i never did. The hallways are all connected geniously and bring you back where you need to be to further the story when you decide you want to go off the beaten path for a bit. Its crazy how well this is done and it makes the "dungeon crawling" a delight rather than a frustration.Overall, the game isnt that scary, but the story, atmosphere, and overall design make it a worthwile purchase.","January 7, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Four things really bother me about it...\n\n1) the lack of an inventory\n2) not being able to light candles lamps ect. (no tinderboxes)\n3) its to dark\n4) 90% of the game looks the same\n\nI originally thought the game was bugged.  I pressed every key trying to find the open inventory button, then I find out that you have no inventory, really?  Puzzles are solved by carrying the needed object which is more often then not very close to where you need to use it, making for an easy to solve (almost boring) puzzle system.  I liked in the dark decent how objects need to sometimes be carried long distances before you find a use for them *note the chemical puzzle in the dark decent, where you need to combine the 4 acids.*\n\nThe game takes place in 1899.  Electricity has just been invented and is not widely popular, so why is there so few candles and oil lamps?  No tinderboxes? no light-able light sources?  I think this is what I dislike most about the game.  In the original, players could light candles and torches whenever they feel insecure (which is most of the time).  In "a machine for pigs", its so dark and without the option to use light sources, after about 30min the player gets use to it, and the scary effect is lost.  Jump scares are one thing, and this game has many of them, but atmosphere is just as important.\n\nYou're given a battery powered lamp that never runs out of juice.  A good thing considering 90% of the game is almost pitch black.  However, I really wish they used an oil lamp instead.  Or even a battery powered lamp that runs out over time.  I liked in the first game how you needed to keep a close eye on your oil so you don't run out at a time when you need it most.  Back to the game being to dark...  In the first game there were really bright rooms occasionally, sometimes with the moon light shining in.  As you play the game and come across a room like this, its a breath of fresh air.  It makes you appreciate the dark rooms a whole lot more.  A nice change of atmosphere, keeps the game fresh and enjoyable to play.  A machine for pigs is pretty much dark all the time, get use to it...\n\nI understand that the game is based around old steam technology, which I found very appealing at first.  Especially the part where you have to start the massive steam engine.  Watching that huge flywheel turn around, gave me goosebumps.  Very well done on that part!  However 90% of the game looks the same.  Your constantly walking through maintenance corridors full of steam pipes.  It got dull very quickly.  I just wanted to see something green again, but it never happened.\n\nOverall, this game is worth checking out if your an amnesia fan.  If not, I would probably pass it by.

I don't like that they don't have an inventory anymore, no health or sanity meter. The lantern mechanic has certainly changed. I also don't think the opposing force of the game is as good as in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n\nIn my opinion (Yours may very well differ), 'A Machine for Pigs' is better than 'The Dark Descent' in some respects, but in most ways, I prefer the first in the series. I DON'T think this one will catch on as well as the first did (though I've been wrong before, we'll see), however I most certainly recommend it to those who enjoyed the first one! Like I said, it's very memorable, touches on some historical facts of the time, as well as insight into 'future' events, and WILL make you think on occasion. I'm glad I played it, and might possibly play it again some time later on.\n\nHad a few good scary and suspenseful parts in it, and hopefully some talented modders will perform some similar magic for this platform as they have for the last one. As is the game has a GREAT feel/atmosphere to it, I don't think that can be improved upon, however as far as scariness goes I believe we can expect some improvements by the upcoming fanbase.

It kind of felt that the game will be like Dark Descent, Unfortunately after you see the monster first time, the scary atmosphere kind of vanishes because the monster itself isnt so scary.

If we compare Amnesia: DD and MfP as horror games, it feels like MfP isnt horror game at all. I would more likely categorize it as agonizing game. Few things what makes it lose its Scary feeling is that you have lamb WITHOUT oil meter, Wich means you can use your lamb all the time without worrying that your oil will suddenly end. There is no need to hide in closet, because when you use your light and those "monsters" are getting close to you it starts to go on and off. When you are near monsters it flashes fast so you know that you need to turn your light off and just go littlebit backwards behind some boxes or barrels and wait until it walks past you.\n\nTough the game itself doesnt seem to be so scary it has amazing story in it. At the beginning of the game you really cant get into it so well but if you keep following it and you listen all the conversations and read all the notes what you find you soon notice how depressing and oppressive it is, and how much the game offers you with its story. The story of this game is only reason why i would recomend this game for people. The horror part of this game seems to be so small that i would more likely keep it as nice extra for this story what you play. In my opinion Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is more one depressing and oppressive but still amazing story, wich have few puzzles and some jumpscares and horror scenes in it.\n\nIm gonna give thumbs up for this game only because of its story.For this game as a horror game im gonna give in my scale just 5/10. i really didnt  like it at all.. BUT! as walktrough of Story im gonna give it 8,8/10. I really enjoyed this game after i just forget the thing that it "sould be" horror game and just focused more the story. So in my opinion, If you are looking for nice Horror game this game get tumbs down. It really isnt worth of money.. But if you wanna game with story then Yes. I highly recommend it for you.","April 23, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is probably becuase of The Chinese Rooms role as developer, but their involvement is also what made the game great.\n\nThe setting was really well thought out and looks great, The atmosphere was very effective, the story was really deep and though provoking, and the soundtrack was absolutely amazing (mostly).

Everything that made Amnesia so unique has been removed. I enjoyed solving the little puzzles, but they presented no real challenge. I felt clever solving them, but after thinking back, the solutions were always very clear. So basically, they make you feel smart without you having to be smart.\nThe monsters on the other hand were just kinda there. I only died to them twice and that was becuase I was too busy fiddling about with machinery to realize they had spotted me. They grunt and wait a minute before beginning to chase you, so you can generally get away before they even start moving.\n\nStory:\nThis is the entire reason I'm reccomending the game. I loved the story. I'm going to try to explain why I loved it without spoiling anything.\nThe first thing I should probably note is that it was rather short. Major events were stuffed together too closely as they would be in a movie, not a game. In a movie, events are packed closely to keep the viewer from getting bored. For a game, you want some seperation between those because you can seperate them without the player getting bored. It increases how much time and entertainment the player is going to get out of the game.\nAside from that, I have no real gripes. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. It was written very well, and presented even better. The game's atmosphere was perfect and the story kept me interested and on my toes the whole time. Progressively learning all about this world I was thrown into is what kept me playing this game until the end.\n\nSo if you want to hear a nice story, this game is for you. If you're expecting another Amnesia game, however... You're not getting that from this game.","April 24, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

(MFP)\n\nNow, let me note that there are tons of reviews, saying that this game is bad and such, Some reviews say its bad only\nbecause its not so 'spoopy' as The Dark Descent (TDD), And well... I disagree,\n\nIt is true that the game isnt as scary or Interactable as the first one, But when you think about it... Frictional games have made games that tell stories, And yes, This WASNT made by them, But it is their franchise.\nI personally think that  The Chinese Room [thechineseroom.co.uk] Did a fantastic job on this game.\n\nNow, Yes, MFP isnt as interactable, But I can see why. If you were delivering a story, you wouldnt want players wandering off\nwith a statue and giving it a name  cough cough , Instead you'd want the player to enjoy the story.\n\nNow, TDD Was story based, yes, but it delivered scares that made you want to just pause the game and nope out of your room, But then again... Did you hear   HEY MAN, AMNESIA THE DARK DESCENT'S STORYLINE IS SO GOOD?\nNo, You didnt.\n\nAll I heard about TDD was that it was a spooky ♥♥♥ game, Not only until later when I played it that it was rich with lore, Story, and even other things.\n\nNow,   The Chinese Room [thechineseroom.co.uk] did just that, They took away most of the spooky stuff and threw the story straight at you...\n\nNow by throwing it at you, I dont mean it was rushed,  Although the game was four hours...  It told it's story at a believeable pace, and it just made you feel uncomfortable from your surroundings.\n\nAnd another thing I liked about this game was the sound track, I mean...  Listen to this beautiful piano piece!  The game delivered it's gritty dark story in a great way.\n\nYes, They however did take out some of the main systems, such as the insanity system, But then again it made the story harder to reach to, But does that justify the fact that they removed it? No, I believe it was unnecassary to remove the Insanity system.\n\nNow, For the story... MFP just drops you in a large house, Call it a mansion if you'd like, Only to find out your children are missing... And of course, Amnesia.  It's not like Daniel in TDD, But I guess... Short term amnesia?\nNow, off to find Edwin and Enoch in your mysteriously abandoned town, and once you find the machine... Idunno man, Play it.\n\nNow, away from my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story review, I believe what mattered the most to the Chinese room was the Story, and damn did they deliver it in a great way, in a dark and gritty world.\n\nPotato/10, There is no slaughter machine for pigs.","June 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

You really don't do much in the way of normal gaming during your experience with Pigs. However, you will find yourself engaged by what you might call narrative/ambient puzzle solving. You aren't asked to find a clever way around a locked door, or trick enemies into sucide, or rearrange parts of a painting to reveal a secret message. Instead, the intellectual satisfaction you'll find in Pigs comes from examining the game's environment and reading cryptic journal entries to understand this narrative's disturbing truths. That is, running through the game without paying enough attention and without thinking critically enough will result in failure--you will have missed the game's point. It's in careful methodic analysis of the narrative elements that you win and experience the pleasure of the game's reward--deep fear and revulsion about your character's tale and even what the story says about the nature of our own lives.\n\nI believe this game's only material shortcoming is technical--it is deceptively resource intensive, despite its lack of visual sophistication. It's not particularly pretty (Outlast, however, is particularly pretty), but slowdown is frequent nonetheless. Routinely, the frame rate would dip on my pc, from around 60fps to something closer to 30fps. I'm not sure if this is the result of visual tricks that I simply didn't appreciate enough to notice, or if it's because of less-than-optimized code. Vision blur never triggered the slowdown. Slowdown occurred most often in the large, more decorated rooms of Mandus's mansion, and in some of the larger chambers below.\n\nPlay this game, though. Its terror doesn't come from visceral, instinctual tension as it does through Dead Space and Outlast. Instead, it disturbs the conscious mind only after reflection and understanding of the story's premise. You won't spend your time with Pigs with white knuckles and a tight stomach. Instead, you will spend days afterward dwelling on dread and the loathing you were meant to feel through Mandus as he rediscovered his own past.","June 10, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That may not be obvious, since I got the retail version instead of the steam version. Hopefully, the high expectations that I had for Machine for Pigs coming off of The Dark Descent did not hurt my experience, though it will definitely affect this review.\n\nI'll be blunt here, I was disappointed to see that the threat of the darkness was gone. I mean, the lantern flickering effect is nice, but without the sanity dropping in the dark, and without the threat of running out of oil, it felt like a big piece of what made the original Amnesia so great was lost. The little parts where your eyes adjust to the darkness was so helpful to navigation, but it was lost here. The lack of an inventory was also dissapointing. But the lack of the sanity meter was the worst part.\n\nHowever, the game was still well worth the money. The music was excellent. In fact, it outmatched the original. The enemies were terrifying, but usually not annoying to escape from. (looking at you Kaernk). I still felt very much immersed in yet another dark storyline, though it felt like one of the big twists was made known too early. The connection between the two main characters helped add weight the story, just as it did during the first game. And the dark efforts of the characters towards their goal was just as chilling as the original Amnesia. Stepping into the outdoors was also a major plus for this game.\n\nAll in all, was it as good as the original? No. Too many of the mechanics that made the original great were removed. It felt stripped-down, sort of.  No sanity bar. No tinderbox conservation. No inventory. No lantern oil.\n\nBut do I still recommend it as an excellent horror game? Yes. It stil has the immersion and the horror that made the original great.","January 4, 2014","true","16.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, i did played The Chinese Room's previous game, Dear Ester, and thought it was pretty good. Now, A Machine for Pigs really isn't that scary. I played basically the entire campaign with headphones on and the lights off to amplify the horror, and honestly, there were only a few times it really scared me. But, that is not the main reason to play this game. A lot of people would say to play this game for the story, and while the story is good, it is pretty hard to follow at points. Important notes and journal entries are written in what seems like old english and at times can be hard to understand, but the basics are always there and you will pretty much have an idea what is going on as you make your way through the factory. The main reason i recommend this game is the atmosphere. It is a dark and dreary victorian-esq setting which works perfectly while traversing with solely an oil lamp. the mansion is looming and the factory is durty and desperate. The Chinese Room knows how important atmosphere can be in games like these and they really outdid themselves. Secondly, the level design is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. There is so much potential to get lost in games like these, with dark corners and hallways everywhere. But somehow no matter how much i strayed and thought i turned myself around, i never did. The hallways are all connected geniously and bring you back where you need to be to further the story when you decide you want to go off the beaten path for a bit. Its crazy how well this is done and it makes the "dungeon crawling" a delight rather than a frustration.Overall, the game isnt that scary, but the story, atmosphere, and overall design make it a worthwile purchase.","January 7, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not a whole lot of hours of gameplay, but it was a few hours of VERY high quality, stylized, atmospheric, and memorable gaming however. I don't like that they don't have an inventory anymore, no health or sanity meter. The lantern mechanic has certainly changed. I also don't think the opposing force of the game is as good as in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\n\nIn my opinion (Yours may very well differ), 'A Machine for Pigs' is better than 'The Dark Descent' in some respects, but in most ways, I prefer the first in the series. I DON'T think this one will catch on as well as the first did (though I've been wrong before, we'll see), however I most certainly recommend it to those who enjoyed the first one! Like I said, it's very memorable, touches on some historical facts of the time, as well as insight into 'future' events, and WILL make you think on occasion. I'm glad I played it, and might possibly play it again some time later on.\n\nHad a few good scary and suspenseful parts in it, and hopefully some talented modders will perform some similar magic for this platform as they have for the last one. As is the game has a GREAT feel/atmosphere to it, I don't think that can be improved upon, however as far as scariness goes I believe we can expect some improvements by the upcoming fanbase. People smarter than I who would know how to create mods and really make people quiver. Come on, give Storpy, Pewds, Markiplier, and the rest of the popular youtube gamers something to scream about ;)\n\nI hope you found this recommendation (and kind of review?) informative! Happy gaming!","September 10, 2013","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It kind of felt that the game will be like Dark Descent, Unfortunately after you see the monster first time, the scary atmosphere kind of vanishes because the monster itself isnt so scary. Tough the few jumpscares and "ONE" particular monster keeps scaring you, i was really disappointed of the "Horror" part oh this game. If we compare Amnesia: DD and MfP as horror games, it feels like MfP isnt horror game at all. I would more likely categorize it as agonizing game. Few things what makes it lose its Scary feeling is that you have lamb WITHOUT oil meter, Wich means you can use your lamb all the time without worrying that your oil will suddenly end. There is no need to hide in closet, because when you use your light and those "monsters" are getting close to you it starts to go on and off. When you are near monsters it flashes fast so you know that you need to turn your light off and just go littlebit backwards behind some boxes or barrels and wait until it walks past you.\n\nTough the game itself doesnt seem to be so scary it has amazing story in it. At the beginning of the game you really cant get into it so well but if you keep following it and you listen all the conversations and read all the notes what you find you soon notice how depressing and oppressive it is, and how much the game offers you with its story. The story of this game is only reason why i would recomend this game for people. The horror part of this game seems to be so small that i would more likely keep it as nice extra for this story what you play. In my opinion Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is more one depressing and oppressive but still amazing story, wich have few puzzles and some jumpscares and horror scenes in it.\n\nIm gonna give thumbs up for this game only because of its story.For this game as a horror game im gonna give in my scale just 5/10. i really didnt  like it at all.. BUT! as walktrough of Story im gonna give it 8,8/10. I really enjoyed this game after i just forget the thing that it "sould be" horror game and just focused more the story. So in my opinion, If you are looking for nice Horror game this game get tumbs down. It really isnt worth of money.. But if you wanna game with story then Yes. I highly recommend it for you.","April 23, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is probably becuase of The Chinese Rooms role as developer, but their involvement is also what made the game great.\n\nThe setting was really well thought out and looks great, The atmosphere was very effective, the story was really deep and though provoking, and the soundtrack was absolutely amazing (mostly).

Not the trivial horror in which the player is always firing with a shotgun, but a deep and perverse psychological experience that dig into the player's darkest thoughts. This second chapter differs in many ways from "The Dark Descent": the sanity meter, the inventory and the oil/tinderboxes related difficulties have been removed, probably with the intent to create a more realistic atmosphere. A great limitation. This was not the best choice to me, since puzzles can't be satisfactorily complex and does not require much effort to be solved. Overall the gameplay result a little too linear but is compensated by a breathtaking atmosphere created by the story, the lovely and disturbing graphic, the dark sound environment and the superb music.\n"A Machine for Pigs" is a very compact and well designed game, that have only one misfortune: be the successor of a perfect game. A lot of people didn't expect Amnesia to change it's way of being.\nI replayed this game 3 times now and I would definitely recommend it.","July 1, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you are not familiar with that game, its basically an interactive novel, which could also be said of Amnesia: AMFP. The problem with this type of game is that it isn't scary!\n\nI played Amnesia:TDD and loved it and I waited a year to play AMFP. I read the reviews, both good and bad, and I knew that this game didn't play the same way as TDD, so I wasn't really expecting a sequel to that game. I was ready to play AMFP as its own game and I desperately wanted to love it. However, regardless of how you look at it, whether you compare it to Amnesia: TDD or you take it as its own game, Amnesia: AMFP is neither scary nor fun.\n\nFirst, let me talk about the gameplay: It's extremely simplistic. The primary point of the game is to turn on/off a giant machine or factory. You would think this would offer a lot of opportunities for organic puzzles as you figure out how to operate a complex machine that you have no memory of creating, right? WRONG. I was never confused about what I was expected to do because the game is extremely linear and usually the switch your are supposed to flip is the ONLY switch you can touch! To make matters worse, whenever you enter a new area, you get a journal entry telling you exactly what you are supposed to do, even though you will already know because it's so obvious.\n\nThe second part of the gameplay is avoiding the pigs, which are the main "monsters" in the game. The pig monsters were absolutely terrible for two big reasons: 1) they are NOT scary, and 2) they have terrible AI and are extremely easy to avoid. Every time I entered a new area I attempted to find good hiding places in case the pig monsters would appear, but 80% of the time it was unnecessary because they wouldn't show. That is probably the worst aspect of the game: you rarely ever see the pigs. The few occasions in which you do, they are stupid easy to avoid and don't even kill you instantly, so you can actually run away from them while taking damage and escape!\n\nThe other element of the game that matters is the story. The story is comprised of documents found throughout the game as well as "visions" or scary moments that you have in-game. The creepiest part of the game is your character's two children, which appear and do creepy stuff every now and again. Everything else, just isn't scary. The pig's are scary for about the first 30 minutes of the game and after that, you just get used to what they look like. The storyline makes very little sense and your character's motivations are unclear. It is hard to give an example without spoiling, but the best I can give is the pigs themselves. It is extremely unclear why the pig mosnters exist and what the purpose for their creation is. Ostensibly, they are supposed to kill people, but the giant machine already does that on its own, so why the pigs? This question is never fully answered and even after going on the wiki and reading the full explanation, it still makes no sense.\n\nOverall, I was completely devastated by how completely bland, boring, and uninspired this game was. If there is a third game in the works, they need to keep The Chinese Room far away from it!","November 29, 2014","false","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although the story once again is excellent and is worth the price of admission, the format of a videogame just does not suit this franchise. But, having said that, if you can get this game for cheap and have a couple hours to spare, a quick playthrough of this title just for the short story won’t go amiss.”\n\n6.5/10 TJBs","January 24, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Although the story once again is excellent and is worth the price of admission, the format of a videogame just does not suit this franchise.

I think A Machine for Pigs is a master stroke in video game horror and storytelling. I consider it a far more captivating experience than The Dark Descent. Where TDD relied more on chase scenes and jump scares, AMFP focused far more on crafting a dark, Lovecraftian world to enthrall the player with.\n\nA Machine for Pigs drops the tiresome sanity meter, which at no point in its predecessor enhanced the experience. This artificial system only served to remove me from the experience. It accomplished nothing but making you feel like your character was extremely drunk. AFMP, on the other hand, approaches the question of sanity organically within the game. You will encounter situations that will make you question your character's sanity and perhaps even your own. Along with losing the sanity meter, it curbed the need for tinderboxes and oil because your lantern is permanently powered now. At no point did I consider this a weakness of the game. Collecting oil and tinderboxes was practically useless in the original even with the lighting settings correctly calibrated.\n\nThe soundscape in this game is truly stellar. The music is haunting and beautiful and greatly adds to the atmosphere of the game. Outside of the music, it has superb sound effects. From the groans and shrieks of the machinery to the otherwordly sounds that come from the pigs, it is all done superbly.\n\nIn another contrast to its predecessor, this game has far less focus on puzzles. And this is another thing that seems to have been very controversial for people. My reply is that this is a horror game. It is not a puzzle game. Puzzle games do not need to have horror sections. Why do horror games need to have puzzle sections? Beyond that, let's not kid ourselves about the puzzles in TDD. They were infantile and even the most challenged player could solve them easily without consulting a walkthrough. So let's not act like this series is famed for its amazing puzzles.\n\nIt is not without its problems, though, It is a very short game. I completed it in 3.4 hours on my first playthrough and that was with seeking out everything and reading everything. While I consider it worth it even at full price, it is still quite a flaw. Another problem is that you cannot back track, so you have to make certain you fully explore an area before trying to move on or you will miss stuff.\n\nStill, this game is amazing. I completely adore it and hope that people will look past all the unwarranted negative reviews it has received. It is superior to The Dark Descent by far.","June 5, 2014","true","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It barely has any character involvement at all. The environment and music are beautiful as they are in Dear Esther, and that makese sense. It's the same developers and the same composer, respectively. The story is also very well written but you won't be able to appreciate it unless you can find the majority of the notes. And that's the only real thing to actually DO in it, besides the occasional simple, boring puzzle and avoiding the occasional pigman who will only spawn at scripted moments and will usually follow a set path, moving around stacks of crates or through hallways. It's only a matter of timing to avoid them. There is no survival elements either, further negating the actual danger in the game and making for poor payoff for the well-designed atmopshere. If this game had all the good elements in it's own right, the story, music, atmosphere and level design as well certain aspects of the first game such as the unpredictable enemies, survival mechanics and intillectually stimulating puzzles I would have appreciated it much more.

First and foremost Machine for Pigs is nothing like Amensia: the Dark Descent, so much so that I refuse to even it call it an Amnesia title.  Don't expect this to even marginally resemble Amensia: the Dark Descent because you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nEverything that made the original what it is known as today, a well designed and terrifying horror experience start to finish, is non-existant in Machine for Pigs.  There is no more health, sanity, lantern fluid and tinderbox necessities and there isn't even a means to examine what condition you're in after you suffer physical damage from enemies.  There is also no inventory to store the very few items you come across.  Granted, the only items you ever need to pick up are obviously only to solve puzzles, if you can even call them that because all they really involve is picking up an item and inserting it into whatever contraption.  There isn't anything puzzling whatsoever.\n\nOne final thought on items is that you must literally carry them in your hands to where they need to go, again, because there is no inventory.  Not a huge deal, however it is  bothersome nonetheless especially if you accidentally drop something and have to go look for it.  All of this  has been removed and I would love to know what the developers were thinking when they made these decisions.\n\nI do wish Frictional Games, Amnesia: the Dark Descent's developers would have gone through and created Machine for Pigs; the Chinese Room evidently had no idea what they got themselves into.  Ultimately Machine for Pigs does not live up the hype its predecessor proved and is an astounding failure in comparison and if it were a standalone title too.  It is no more than a dumbed-down, unbearably linear walking simulator with the occasional half-arsed jumpscare thrown in to laughably try and capture an ounce of horror. I'd suggest avoiding this altogether unless you just need to say that you finished both Amnesia titles.\n\n2/10","January 8","false","5.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The monsters are always well lit and kind of silly looking (I kept thinking of the pig sidekick from "Beyond Good and Evil" every time I saw them), and what's more, are barely in the game at all.  The lack of horror would be fine if it succeeded in some other area, but unfortunately it doesn't.  There are some puzzles, but it's not really an adventure game either.  "Amnesia" had very few puzzles, but made great use of its physics engine in the puzzles that it did have.  In contrast, the majority of AMfP's puzzles are of the "find 3 different switches to progress" variety, with next to no use of the game’s excellent physics engine.\n\nGiven the limited scares, gameplay, and interactivity, AMfP ultimately plays more like a sequel to the Chinese Room's earlier game, "Dear Esther," rather than "Amnesia."  The ending deals with some interesting ideas about the horrors of the 20th century, but much like "Dear Esther," the developers never find a compelling means of expressing those ideas via gameplay.  So you are left with an odd tech demo type experience that is part adventure game, part horror game, and part interactive movie, but that never commits fully enough to any of these elements to do them properly.  The result, much like “Dear Esther,” reaches far, but ultimately collapses under the weight of its own pretensions, ending up playing a bit like an amateurish “Amnesia” mod awkwardly mashed up with a freshman creative writing project.\n\nA huge disappointment.","November 8, 2014","false","3.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Clocking in at about three hours long, the conclusion to the game is rushed and the enemies do not provide the same tension those in the first game do, especially with the removal of the terror metre and insanity scale. Enemies are easily shaken off and the AI is painfully dumb: taking far too long to react when light is being shone directly on them from a few feet away.\n\nThe puzzles are likewise easier this time around, the most challenging of them being shining a light on a tube of chemicals to generate electricity. It is all very straight forward, and the story the game tells isn't nearly as intricate as it's predacessor.\n\nThe game would be scarier if they had more 'enemies' than pigmen and tesla pigmen, both of which you will find ridiculous to several degrees upon examination. While not a bad game by any stretch of imagination, it failed to deliver the horror aspect completely after the first few minutes of gameplay, and I felt that too much of the game takes place without seeing a single enemy (the first enemy you encounter is 30-45 minutes in, and there is little tension building prior to this. If this was an eight hour game that wouldn't be a problem, but it's not)","October 9, 2014","false","5.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Unlike the first Amnesia, the environment can't be interacted with unless absolutely necessary. Closets, dressers, and nonessential doors have enormous locks on them and can't be opened, and the props lying around can't be picked up or moved unless they are explicitly used to solve puzzles. While this does prevent you from getting lost, it really hurts the immersion factor. There is no more inventory or sanity meter, and although you can die from taking too much damage, health isn't visible. Monster encounters are also a lot less frequent than the original game, and since the environment is static they seem a lot easier to avoid. You very rarely feel threatened or vulnerable so the game doesn't do a good job of being scary.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere is fantastic, and the visual style and sound design are a bit better than the original. I had heard that the story has nothing to do with the original, but it does in fact make several references, including namedropping Brennenburg early on. There is a pretty interesting plot here with good pacing, a few twists, and I felt compelled to keep playing to find out more about the mythos of the world. This game has a stellar soundtrack with excellent voice acting and beautiful music that lends an imposing feel to the world and really emphasizes the impressive setpieces and more dramatic moments in the story perfectly. I also enjoyed the grim industrial complex a bit more than the dilapidated castle from the first game.\n\nIn all, I felt pretty good about this game. It was a good experience despite the lack of interaction. As long as you aren't looking for a real immersive "horror" experience I definitely recommend playing it, there's a lot of cool things to see and an interesting world to learn about if you're willing to explore. Plus the soundtrack is gorgeous. You might want to wait for it to go on sale though, it's not very long. I hope I can look forward to seeing more Amnesia games in the future.","April 5, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The Dark Descent featured challenging puzzles, pulse-raising ‘run or hide’ decision making, inventory management and constant danger. A Machine for Pigs holds none of these accolades, however, it’s still a good game! It has an interesting story with some horrific themes running throughout. It really makes you feel like you are trapped within the innards of some mechanical beast.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics (or lack of) There are a few terrifying and jumpy moments before you actually encounter a pig-monster face-to-face... Until you realise that they are a totally pointless gameplay mechanic. Normally, in games where you must rely on either running or hiding from enemies (e.g. the game’s predecessor or Outlast), there is normally some general indication as to where to run or hide. Whether this is done by backtracking to previously seen areas, or running towards illuminated exits. With other games there is fun to be had in evading danger, but not in a Machine for Pigs. The pig-monsters spot you instantly and you can rarely outrun them! This is all okay though because if you get killed, you simply black out and spawn further on in the game, as if the encounter never happened... What’s the point?\n\nAs soon as I hear a pig’s squeal, this is normally my reaction:\n\n“Oh blimey! It’s a pig-man! And he’s spawned right behind me again! I guess I’d better run ahead!”\n\n*runs ahead*\n\n“Oh-no! There’s nothing here! You know what?... Sod this! I’ll just take a beating because I have no idea what is going on...”\n\n*stands there, gets beaten to death by pig trotters and respawns*\n\n“Ohhhhhhh so I was meant to run down that ridiculously dark corridor that was obstructed from view by that massive pipe! Stupid me!”\n\nLiterally, I’d say 2 out of 3 pursuits could pan out like this. The action is AWFUL. The "puzzles" literally rely on pressing buttons, replacing power fuses or turning steam valves. That said, simply looking at the machinary is a joy to be had and interacting with it can be quite fun!\n\nWhy it is good! The game’s redeeming features are the story and the atmosphere. I’m not going to say much about the story, but it is really good! The themes expressed are extremely dark and the way everything unfolds is rather marvellous. Whoever designed all of the machinery did a really good job. The large growling machines and the spitting steam pipes twisting all around create a very immersive portrayal of 19th century industry. Brilliant ambient noises with the accompaniment of eerie music makes you want to jump out of the nearest factory window. There are some instances at the start that had me bricking myself.\n\nWhat's with the title? I personally don’t believe this game should have been called “Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs” because it is hardily like its predecessor. The only thing that is the same is that you can open draws and doors, and wind steam valves with mouse actions. That’s it! Everything else has changed. The game feels more like a scary industrial Dear Esther. However, I can totally understand why the developers would want to capitalise on a series.\n\nShould you buy it? Essentially, if you want an incredibly immersive and very artistic story-based gaming experience, this game is probably for you. However, if you want a heart-pounding survival horror – don’t even think about it. It’s nothing like the previous game and your money would probably be better spent on Outlast, if you haven’t already played it.\n","March 19, 2015","true","11.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This is not the same type of game.\n\nThis is more or less a lot like Dear Eshter, a mod made into game, that is simply you walking around listening to stories by the narrator.\n\nIn Amnesia AMFP's case, you are doing very little puzzles and mainly just walking around as things happen, there is really no point in searching for any items, because there are NONE to gather! You are directed to every single object required to finish a puzzle and you don't do much aside from walking around, turn on a valve or two or pull some levers, then walk some more, often the narrative takes control from you, for the sake of telling you the story.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of inventory, there are no items to combine for a puzzle or things to conserve.\n- Lack of sanity meter, you don't have to worry about anything.\n- Most of the environments were dull and you can't interact with it, 80-90% of the time like in Amnesia and Penumbra. They look good though, but thats about it.\n- The flashlight you find is endless, it requires no fuel or battery.\n- Exploring in it is kind of pointless since all you are looking for are notes, and if there are puzzles, you mostly find stuff immediately, there is nothing cleverly hidden.\n\n\nPros:\n- The Score is pretty good.\n- Most of the areas had nice-good atmosphere.\n- It had very good concepts for the most part.\n\nI would say more about the story and monster, but this remains spoiler free.\n\nOverall, I rate this game 5/10, it's not really a survival horror game, it's just a walking horror tale.","September 10, 2013","false","4.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","4"

I love the original Amnesia, but I wasn't expecting a whole lot more from the sequel. Boy, was I wrong.  Machine for Pigs managed to do what Dark Descent did, but better- and by doing even less.  The gameplay involves a lot fewer "typical" aspects (no health, sanity, or inventory) but still manages to not feel dumbed down.  The story is gripping and not only enhanced, but completed by the notes you find.  They don't feel like a random side thing to grab when you see one, but feel like an actual part of the story and make you want to actively search for them to uncover what is happening to you.\n\nIncredible game, solid horror atmosphere, and a thrilling mystery\n\nPlay this ♥♥♥♥, yo.","January 29","true","6.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalmethod357/recommended/239200/","metalmethod357","metalmethod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metalmethod357/","38 products in account","I asked a lot of people about this particular game and I recieved mixed reviews ranging from 'Great!' to 'God-awful'. So to see for myself I bought it. I was pleasantly suprised. So to sum it up I'm gonna go over a few points. (WARNING: SPOILERS)\n\nContext: The game is set on the last days of December of the year 1899, with it finally turning to 1900 at the end of the game. You interact with a Victorian environment that's very steampunk-y in it's design. Expect cogs, pistons, sliding factory doors, conveyor belts and industrial blast furnaces. Throughout the story you will encounter early telephone devices on the walls and recieve calls from a strange and omnipresent voice belonging to a character known only as 'The Engineer'.\nAmnesia differs from the first game by introducing an outside element to the game, especially towards the end where you must run through the streets of Victorian London whilst the mass murder of it's populace occurs around you.\n\nAesthetics: For me this was a beautiful game. The artwork was fantastic. This may have been because I'm a sucker for the steampunk genre but ho-hum. I enjoyed every single bit of this game and genuinely appreciated the time and effort gone into making this stunning environment. The visual appeal ranges from the ornate and flamboyant house that is Oswald Mandus's stately mansion to the grimy, grim and grotesque lab areas, slaughtering floors and the rightly feared animal holding pens.\n\nPlay-style: Like it's older counter-part the Dark Descent; Amnesia: AMFP is a first-person survival horror in a steampunk-y, spooky environment full of beasts that crawl throug the sewage pipes, ventilation shafts and walkways of varying factory levels, storage warehouses and even a church at one point! The decision to remove the inventory was a brash and somewhat unexpected and occasionally unwanted move. But as contreversial as it was it did help the game flow and also removed the average Dark Descent player's favourite hiding spot! There is also an infinite lantern an the removal of Daniel's nyctophobic anxiety disorder; AKA: the fear of the darkness. These combined made it so that there was no need for a finite lantern fuel system. Many players would be very happy to run around in the darkness as there would be no pyschological consequences, unlike the Dark Descent where the other threat was passing out due to lost sanity from being in the dark too long.\nInstead the lantern now acts as a rough early-warning system in relation to the monsters proximity to the player. Watch for the flickering lantern!\n\nSo in conclusion I think that the game deserves a solid 7/8-10. It's beautiful environment and chilling storyline following the plot of Oswald Madus slowly losing his mind in anger towards the harsh and unforgiving capitalist society only intersted in personal-gain and greed. I really enjoyed walking/running/hiding through the levels and thought that they really added towards a creepy atmosphere within the game. The music whilst beautiful is also deeply unerving and goes towards the horrific feeling of being within the bowels of this immense machine. It's only shortcoming is it's lack of really, genuinely terrifying points becuase of tension. Don't get me wrong there's tension but not the spine-chilling, brain-bursting tension that would make Chuck Norris weep in his seat. Despite this; overall, definately worth a look! Especially if you like steampunk. If you need further convincing look at some of the playthroughs on Youtube, there are plenty of intersting videos to watch! Enjoy and have fun!\n\nRegards ~ MetalMethod357\n\nP.S. I'd love some feedback on this. I'm thinking of writing reviews for a lot of games, so tell me what you think.","January 2, 2014","true","25.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pelvo_del_fuego/recommended/239200/","pelvo_del_fuego","KLED","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pelvo_del_fuego/","1018 products in account","Put simply, this game consists of encountering some kind of roadblock, finding the usually laughably easy solution to a "puzzle" and then watching as every important door relocks itself behind you. There's also machinery and pigs, all wrapped up in a very dark package. If you were to ask me in person what I think of A Machine For Pigs I'd reply with a shrug and a low non-committal noise, then suggest you just play it.\n\nYou know in The Dark Descent how you could pick up all of the random clutter scattered around the place and throw it around or break it? It was a great way to destress yourself after a scary part. A Machine For Pigs doesn't let you do that, the vast majority of the crap strewn around is just for decoration now and can't be interacted with. You also can't throw important items, so if, for example, you had to stick a lever into a hole in the wall, you couldn't chuck it from across the room and feel like a badass. Luckily (or not I guess) you won't need destressing. We'll get to that later though.\n\nSpeaking of not picking things up, you no longer have an inventory so you won't be scouring every nook and cranny for tinderboxes or oil. Almost everything's electric now, including your lantern, so there's no danger of running out of light. Not that that would be a problem anyway, but I'll get to that in a sec. On one hand, this is good news because it means you can keep advancing and following the story, but on the other hand not worrying about your oil removes a lot of tension. Remember when you were new to The Dark Descent and you didn't know all of the cheap ways to gain oil and avoid enemies? Those were the days. The lights suffer from the same issues as lights in every other horror game, so you know that if they start flickering it's brown trousers time.\n\nBack to running out of light not being a problem - this is because they've removed the sanity mechanic. In The Dark Descent if you sat in the dark or looked at a monster for too long you'd start losing your mind. This ultimately made it easier for enemies to get you. In A Machine For Pigs, however, you can just sit there with your light off and stare at the enemies until they get out of your way, just like in every other stealth game. The first time I encountered an actual enemy (as in an enemy that can attack you, not just scamper past and disappear around a corner) was in a massive dark room. I heard a horrid noise and was looking around, trying to find out what had made it, when suddenly a pig-monster thing ran at me and spanked me a few times. I ♥♥♥♥ you not, I "escaped" by turning off my lantern and crouching on the spot. I didn't expect that to work and had already resigned myself to having to restart when the monster strolled off. This brought back painful memories of Call of Cthulhu.\n\nLet's talk about scares. A Machine For Pigs takes the "make a loud noise and shake everything"\n\nroute. Now I'm not a game designer or horror writer or anything, I just play games, but this just feels more annoying than scary. The worst part is that whenever this happens the game stops you from moving, so you know there's absolutely no danger because you don't have the option to run and hide. When there is danger, on the other hand, the game makes sure to point you at the enemy during this temporary paralysis, so you know exactly where NOT to go. Thanks game. I don't know, maybe horror games just aren't for me any more.\n\nA Machine For Pigs was meant to be released in time for Halloween 2012, but was delayed until early September 2013. They said that the delay was because they weren't happy with the game and wanted to improve it. What we got was a watered down and honestly kind of dumb game that was over in about 4 hours, so I shudder to think what they had before the delay.\n\nThis whole thing felt a bit unfair. I really should have been focusing on what the game DID, not what it didn't do. It's just that everything was done so well in the past. If you want my real opinion, The Dark Descent is better than A Machine For Pigs, and the Penumbra series is better than either Amnesia game. As for the recommendation, do NOT buy this for $20. If you've not got The Dark Descent yet, spend your $20 on that instead, or better yet head over to the Frictional Games store and grab the Penumbra series for $10. It pains me to say it but this was just a huge disappointment.","September 11, 2013","false","6.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Having played quite a few horror games before, including even "Amnesia: The Dark Descent", i thought i knew what to expect. This game, however, showed me this thrilling feeling in a new light, something that i don't recall having experienced before so intensely: the excruciating build-up of tension, the prolonged moments of waiting for your "first encounter", whose signs are scattered all around you and become increasingly common. You know you've been waiting for this moment from the beginning of the game, yet it constantly torments you not through immediate fulfillment, but through a psychologically exhausting postponement of the act, like a sick version of a prelude that drags on and on, until you almost beg for it to happen, certain that whatever horrors are eventually revealed can not match in mental fatigue the torture that you've been put through while waiting for it, while stumbling in uncertainty and confusion, never knowing what you will face beyond the next door in your path.\n\nAnd, not to worry - or should i rather say, do worry! - when the awaited moment actually happens, when "your soul shudders at what you have just seen", this feeling is far from over; if anything, it makes you even more aware and uneasy about the slumbering horrors burdening your journey into the dark and de-humanizing industrial complex.","January 4, 2014","true","8.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

From the start there is no feeling of immersion, fear, nevermind horror. Runs very poorly on my computer, which is admittedly old, but which still can run much prettier games like Farcry 2 and Fallout New Vegas. This one looks worse and runs worse than either of those.\n\nMain reason I don't recommend this is a very poor sense of immersion. You can pick up some objects, but everything else is static. I threw a chair on a table with bottles and cutlery, and the chair just slammed into them, nothing happened. Also, although I didn't play for too long, there was no sense of urgency, and I just didn't care about the story at all. I just walked through the house, heard some rumbling and saw lights flickering. Not scary, nothing to do with horror.\n\nAlso, some triggered events were just really annoying.

To my dismay, after completing the game in less than 2 hours (compared to more than 10 for TDD) I was left feeling completely unsatisfied.  I did not speed through the game by any means and in fact, only really got slowed down by the common obtuse puzzle.  The game left me incredibly unsatisfied and here is why.\n\nThroughout the entire game, ignoring the last half hour or so, you encounter the monster probably twice.  Both times, the encounters lasted less than a minute or two as I just wait for the monster to walk past and exit through a door or just sneak past while he patrolled the area.  This aspect almost completely killed the atmosphere after the first 45 minutes or so when I realized that the monster is never a threat.  During the last half hour of the game when it bizarrely turns into a Michael bay sequence of explosions and pigs running everywhere doing little dances, I basically ran through it all because they were never a serious threat.  There is also no sanity meter and no pickups in the game whatsoever including fuel for your lantern which makes it less important than it was in previous games to scour your environment to find necessary items.  Having the items absent on their own isn't necessarily a bad thing but there is nothing else other than the notes to encourage exploration except when desperately searching to find "missing item #x" to progress past the latest puzzle.\n\nAlong the lines of not encouraging exploration is the level design itself.  Much of the game is claustrophobically linear to a fault and feels very forced at times with locked doors absolutely everywhere in the game.  This felt like it was designed in a way to keep the story's pacing from coming to a screeching halt for too long or to keep the puzzles from becoming even more complex.\n\nThis game is also developed solely by The Chinese Room (unknown to myself until after, I had thought they were simply working with Frictional Games) who are best known for making Dear Esther.  The story for MfP is absolutely impenetrable for many if you don't get the symbolism involved and you don't read the notes scattered around the map (because of the aforementioned lack of items).  When I made it to the end of the game, many things began to make sense but a lot of the circumstances leading up to the game's introduction made very little sense to me.\n\nThe other issue I have, while a small gripe, is with the graphics of the game.  They look uglier than TDD mainly due to the dark brown camera filter that is placed over 80% of the game as opposed to simply being in the environments' color palate.  While TDD's color palate was more of a bluish hue which ironically promoted a sense of calm in the player when in shadows (blue being a calming color and most visibly present when your "eyes" adjust to the darkness in-game).\n\nWith those negatives in mind, I must say that despite the lack of a real threat in the game, the game's atmosphere and soundtrack are incredibly tense and deserve mention as the game could almost be carried entirely by the atmosphere imo.  If there was one thing that kept me pinned down behind some boxes with my eyes wide and unblinkingly searching the room for potential threats, it was the atmosphere.\n\nThe voice acting is also very emotional and I was quite moved by many story sections leading up to the game's conclusion.  I wasn't bawling over it but it left me in a very sorrowful mood though in a good way.  By the end of the game, except for my lack of understanding the story behind it all, I genuinely cared about the protagonist's goal and once again the soundtrack helps emphasize these moments beautifully.  While I didn't understand the finer points and symbolism hidden within the game's story, I got enough of an idea to find it interesting, though the dominant symbolic idea (pigs) quickly grew repetitive by the end of the game's very short runtime.\n\nWith all this in mind, I do not recommend this game to anyone but those who liked Dear Esther AND aren't too picky with their horror experience.  The Chinese Room very obviously wanted to make another game like their previous game but also wanted to make it seem like an Amnesia game what with a monster to chase you and physics puzzles to solve.  Stripping out much of what made the previous game and other Penumbra so unique and even making the monster a rare occurrence took out much of the soul of this game.  I know there is much deeper meaning within this game than I could really understand but it should not be the only part about this game.  If they had just added more encounters with the monster in this game that were actually dangerous, while still keeping everything else the same, this game would have been incredible if not damn-near perfect.  As it is, this feels more like "Dear Piggies" than an Amnesia game or really a horror game of any kind.  An incredible atmosphere and believable voice actors could not save this game from feeling like more than a rather mediocre custom story from TDD.","December 1, 2013","false","2.9"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","6"

It's a very short linear path to complete the game, finding and reading all the notes did little to pad out the 4 HOURS it took to complete this game. Sound and music, while the amount was limited, was good throughout and I enjoyed the music as soon as game hit the main menu. Story was pretty weak and forgettable with a twist ending that was heavily hinted at throughout if you paid attention.\n\nGraphics/visuals are pretty and interesting to start off, but seem to get worse and less interesting the further you go. Starting with beautiful building interiors, transitioning to interesting machine stuff, and then it started to become bland with the next sections. As I got to the belly of the machine, I wanted to be disgusted, seeing a mix of pig and human gore that powered the machine all over the place...all I got was poor red water textures travelling in.\n\nThe gameplay is sadly the weakest part of this game. Sadly its boring compared to the previous game, there were 2 sections where I started to get interested, saying: "this is where it starts getting good with the pig monster.". Unfortunately that didn't happen. Instead of playing cat and mouse with the monster as you complete objectives, its practically all on rails to run away along the linear path of the game. While the previous game had these segments, they were intense because you played with it by closing doors, hiding, jumping onto furniture to avoid the water monster, etc. This game just had run. These were frustrating because the monster was much faster than you, rather than be roughly the same speed as in the previous game. getting killed by the monsters in the last game was because you ♥♥♥♥ed up. In this game its the game's fault by its  poor design.\n\nThe puzzels are stupidly easy, and completing an objective is basically done in a few steps in one direction. There are also removed gameplay features, no mods, less visuals, completely removed sections, sounds, and ai compared to the previous game. Simply put: this was an amnesia game repackaged into Dear Esther in the dark. Did i mention once you go through many of the doors that split the game's sections... YOU CAN'T GO BACK! WTF, WHY DID YOU DESIGN IT LIKE THAT. I know I missed a bloody note, and i cant get it without restarting the entire game. ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nAt the time before release I saw the trailers and pre-ordered based off of those and my experiece with the previous amnesia game. If only I had realised just how much of this was a "the chinese room game", and not a "frictional games" game. I expected to feel tense and excited to finally play this game. Unfortunately I got virtually kicked in the balls and in the wallet, and a lesson to not pre-order games.\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND: DEAR AMNESIA: RUNNING IN THE DARK WITH PIGS","December 6, 2013","false","4.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I'd be trying to muffle a scream, pausing the game, being very, very cautious leaning around every corner and putting my head in my heads to try and catch my breath back... and then while I descended, the game descended in atmospheric quality. In the end, I just found myself trudging through the dark with my never-ending light source, not scared in the slightest.\n\nThe puzzles... were not puzzles. Those "sabotages" acted more a mere obstacle with which just to step over; no challenge. Everything was spoon-fed. If anything, this made the game act as an interactive novel, in which I didn't feel any sympathy for the characters, nor the true innocents of the game.\n\nWhile some of the more immersive and explorative features of the original Amnesia were absent, I feel it didn't detract from the game. However, the overall linear feel of the game, and enemy indication feature was a complete buzz kill; there is no adrenaline injected into the atmosphere.

In addition, I loved how my enviroment constantly changed around me, and that kept up a certain level of interest for me to complete the game within my 3rd session.\n\nI wanted to get lost in the dark. I wanted to be cowering in a corner behind some boxes with a Wretche's back to me, trying to sniff me out. I wanted ample cause to hide for ages, even when they are long gone.

[WARNING! MASSIVE SPOILERS!]\n\n\nJust beat the game and I must say, the scariest thing I experienced was boredom. In my opinion not only it was a bad sequel to the first Amnesia and to Frictional's previous works, but it also was a bad game on its own.\n\nIt's a game without mechanics, except for walking, jumping, holding a lantern and moving a very limited amount of objects. Sanity/light conservation were so important in the first Amnesia not only as gameplay elements, but also as a way to scare you. You didn't want to run out of oil because, if you did so, your sanity would start to drop making you easier to spot, and also it created fear with the threat of being sorrounded by darkness with no means to know what lurked in there, being totally helpless and vulnerable. They got rid of that: problem is, resource limitation is a big fear inducing factor in this genre: you are constantly worried, checking your inventory frequently to control your resources because if you run out you won't be able to survive. Here you feel perfectly safe because you don't have a resource that can run out and cripple your chances of survival. They also got rid of interaction with objects, that was not only funny but also useful to slow enemies from advancing. So gone are the days of barring a door behind you or frantically move away trash blocking your path during a chase sequence since duh! No interactable objects! I missed these mechanics, even if they wouldn't be very useful in this game since the solution for every single enemy encounter is to run since enemies are as fast as snails.\n\nPuzzles, a staple in the genre, are gone. Or better, they are so dumbed down I didn't even have to think to solve them, just place the only interactable item, located a couple of meters away, to X socket, randomly click different switches to activate a mechanism or pull a lever in plain sight without any clue on what it will do except letting you progress with the game. I really hated the lack of challenge in these so called puzzles, being puzzle solving one of my favourite parts in this kind of games.\n\nNow, people say atmosphere is great and I agree... until you leave the church. Then it becomes dull and repetitive. The environment is just an endless series of steam pipes and pistons, not scary nor interesting. The thing I hated most is the feeling of safety I experienced during my whole playtime. I always felt safe from harm, due to the fact that most of the encounters with enemies were actually a harmless script, like those with Manpigs crossing your path and then disappearing. Whenever I saw an enemy running before me I knew he was harmless, so the tension was non-existent due to the lack of actual dangers. They should have tried harder than these wannabe jump scares. Also, the "blue mist" ruined the fear of what may lurk in the dark since darkness wasn't... well... actual darkness. Random recorders scattered around didn't help immersion nor it did help the unbelievable fact that Oswald recorded things he shouldn't have, like "hey professor let me record me killing you so my future self will be able to remember how cruel he is". And, yes, I played it slowly, walking and reading notes, with headphones, lights off and trying to enjoy the game instead of trying to just beat it. As you can see, it was useless.\n\nThere were like 5 actual enemy encounters during my whole playthrough, all of which just required to run since enemies do very easily give up chasing. No hiding involved, no trembing in darkness hoping they wouldn't spot me. While chasing, enemies can't break open doors and crouching in a corner with your lantern shut will be enough to make them forget about you. Now, I know that in a game like this you have to arrange enemy encounters so the player won't get used to them and stop being scared, but this is otrageus. While I walked I was always sure nothing was going to kill me since there were so few monsters around and also because of your lantern's ability to warn you when an enemy is close, further killing any suspance and tension. There are a couple of chase sequences like in the original Amnesia. However, wile in the original they where adrenaline filled here they are just boring due to the fact that enemies are slow, they don't deal much damage and they take their time before actually starting to chase you. The soundtrack also fails to underline chase sequences. Manpigs are not scary at all and I found the Electic Pig quite comical. It's alive! IT'S ALIIIVE!\n\nGone are the days of exploring rooms and opening closets since every door and every closet is barred and is actually just a texture with nothing behind it, wich made me feel even safer: since there's no room behind it it's impossible for a monster to jump out from said door. In the first game you often find yourself exploring the whole area to find the item to open the way you need to go or to solve the puzzle you need in order to continue. In this game there's no need for it since the whole thing can easily be described as a corridor. Pure linear map design at it's worst, no exploration involved. Having a fixed path before me and being handheld broke immersion and atmosphere quite badly, remembering me all the time I was playing a videogame much like the first Mario Bros would.\n\nThe plot felt uninteresting to me. It was much like the first Amnesia, you do something bad, suffer amnesia and then try to fix it. However, while in the first it was much more believable since you were just trying to save your life and getting revenge, in this chapter you are much like an Evil Overlord who regrets it's old ways. And the reasons behind the action of your old self are just idiotic: yeh society is evil, let's kill everybody and have a race of abominable suine maniac murderers rule the world, sure they will be much better than humanity. I felt the story was just bad, I preferred the first one's since it was clearer, better presented and I felt more involved since it was focused on my playing character's person and backstory. Here the story is hidden in too many cryptic walls of text that mostly made no sense, self written ones are repetitive and dumb: half is "I've seen so many horrors but I have to keep pushing to save my obviously dead kids" and the other half "I was evil and now I have to redeem myself and destroy the machine". While in the first one you uncover the story slowly keeping your interest high, here you have it all since the beginning: you know since the first minutes of gameplay that Oswald is evil since his own house has built-in passages that linked guest rooms to corpsedisposal-o-matics; the line "Daddy please, don't hurt me" heavilly suggests that he killed his children and the Evil Machine was built by him, under his own house, so we already know we are playing as a mass murderer that killed his sons, random guests and built an Evil Machine, the only thing we miss is what exactly does the machine do. So we have tipical Evil Overlord flick trying to destroy the world according to his twisted visions and ideals, only this time the Evil Overlord gets flu and forgets what his masterplan was and tries to stop it. Also please, the men=pigs 'cuz we're greedy and we're selfish and we're evil and we exploit children was done before... by Orwell, for instance... and greatly overdone by almost a century of communist propaganda.\n\nThe whole graphics aspect can be summarized as "blue filter/haze that prevents you from seeing anything clearly".\n\nAt least I liked the music but I missed the tune the original Amnesia played when you get spot by a monster.\n\nOverall, AMFP felt like a safe, warm hallway with nothing to do in it but walk and read notes to progress with it's bad storyline and sometimes place an item in a socket or run from a slow enemy. It was a total disappointment and I disliked it to the point I had to force myself to finish it, agonizing in boredom every second.","December 22, 2013","false","5.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The smart, yet empty, house and the networks of industrial machinery are unpleasantly eerie and set the tone nicely. Crackling radios, the creaking of valves in the distance and the solitary ring of an isolated telephone... certainly a well-crafted environment\n\nThe problem, however, is that a large portion of what made the original scary has been removed. The tinderboxes/lamp are replaced by a lantern with unlimited fuel. Whilst the new mechanic DOES get used to good effect on a few occasions - There's no longer any dread, no longer any fear and rationing. You don't lose sanity, so the darkness is more an inconvenience than a threat now. The only fear now is what you're likely to stumble upon. Unnerving, yes - but lacks the same intensity and immediate danger\n\nThe puzzles / environment interactions have also been largely stripped from the game. Whilst I appreciate looking in your inventory and collecting items might detract from the plot: It wasn't an issue before, so seems odd to remove it now. You're left with a more linear path and just having to throw switches / carry objects from A to B\n\nTruth be told, the main appeal seems to be the story... but grudgingly it doesn't do it for me. It feels reminiscent of those films where you're shouting "don't open the door you idiot!" - You're clearly going to walk into either a trap or something nasty. You're being led by a random voice calling you from the machine rooms, giving you mysterious hints and vague details... with the protagonist constantly asking where his kids are. It's wishy washy and lacks the edge to encourage you to keep going\n\nIt's still fun to play (when it doesn't crash) - but it just lacks the tension","November 30, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game presented me with an intriguing, thought-provoking, entertaining and most disturbed tale that really had my mind racing all throughout and even after, as well as my heart for much of the second two thirds of the game. The gameplay is rather simple, in a good way; unlike the first game, you can't manipulate most of the objects in the game and there are no mechanics pertaining to the player (i.e. inventory, sanity, etc) except for health. Most of the game involves solving moderately challenging puzzles (not so easy as to be boring, and not so hard as to require the aid of the internet), with a few action scenes wherein the player must flee monsters or escape pipes filling with hot steam. The level design is relatively realistic and rather expansive in multiple cases, and the graphical design of the game is rather excellent. The actual graphics are somewhat average -- this was not a game intending to boast its graphics, but some of its textures are noticably low quality, and the same goes for some unimportant static meshes. These things aren't too prevalent however, and shouldn't bother most people (I just happen to be the kind of person that examines the textures, models and graphical FX closely in games whenever given the chance).\n\nOverall, excellent game.

Well, what can i say? Being the second game after Amnesia: The Dark Descent, it has kept the same charisma of its forerunner. But many things have been changed in this game: now you don't have to pick up oil for your lantern or any item that can make light, but you have an electric lantern with infinite light; the only things you must pick up are the papers, and this aspect makes the game a bit less interesting than the precursor. Accordingly to this, you don't have an inventory anymore, and the icons of the phisical health and mental health are disappeared, and this is one of the worst points of this sequel i must say. The riddles aren't hard to solve like the ones in Dark Descent, and with the fact that you don't have an inventory, you can't bring items with you, and many times you only have to push levers or turn valves. But speaking about the positive aspects, A Machine for Pigs keeps the suspance with a very good plot and awesome musics; the monsters are well designed and the sounds that the pigs make are pretty scary. The ending was unexpected, and I was much surprised by all the philosophical concepts which are inserted into the game, expecially in the final part.\nIn the end, it's a good game, not good like Dark Descent, but it has its good points.

The single player story was entertaining throughout and the puzzles were smoothly done to maintain a very flowing gameplay experience. Everything looked disgustingly gorgeous as well throughout the campaign and except a few textures that i personally would wantt a bit sharper up close when playing the looks of this game is great, so along with the sound work. Not only were the sound effects great but how the sound was used around you I do approve of, and in dark areas you rely as much on your hearing as your vision.\n\nCONS:\nHowever I do want to leave some cons in here, if you've played through the first Amnesia, this one feels a bit lacking when it comes to encounters of patrolling npcs in dark areas, there could've been more situations of this in my eyes since this is probably what most people remember the other game for. Though the story is just as solid if not better excecuted in Machine for pigs, you do feel like there could've been just more gameplay avoiding and sneaking past npcs and everything feels a bit too straight forward at times which might actually make it a bit shorter than it could've been, and the game lands in on about 3 and a half hours worth of playthrough, which I'd personally consider a bit too short to leave a greater mark.\n\nAnother thing to note that doesn't have to always be bad but does change the mechanics of the game, is that the inventory system is completely missing in this game. This leaves out things like looking for items to carry and craft, to find and fill on your oil in the lantern etc. This was a what I'd consider an important aspect of the game to make it what it was, and without it, it just feels thin.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe game is a great game by any means, and it remains on top of the line when it comes to horror/adventure games worth playing out there, but if it comes to the question "Is it better than Amnesia: Dark Descent?" My answer is,  No, it probably isn't. But if you enjoyed any of their other games I'd suggest getting this in no time since the pricetag is not too bad, and Linux support is great as well(Yes mac is for it too but who'd want to play on such crap anyway).\n\nGreat game, get it if you like Amnesia or Penumbra. Just be aware that it might be over before you know it.","September 14, 2013","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With all the Youtube press it recieved and barrage of indie horror games mimicking that followed. It's hard to deny it was an influential, innovative, and fantastic game. This game was a huge letdown in contrast. It's not all this game's fault however, the original Amnesia came out of nowhere as a suprise and thus I had no expectations from it other than was most likely going to be frightening to say the least. So it's hard to achieve something bigger than what the original had. That being said, I was still excited from the coverage I had been following online concerning this game so I was nonetheless pumped about it. It was a day one purchase for me out of pure faith. The opening seemed interesting to say the least but as soon as that was over and the gameplay segment had begun it didn't take long for me to notice changes in the series... changes for the worse.\n\nFirst off I almost immediately noticed you could not interact with most of the furniture and objects laying around the rooms. In the first Amenesia you could mess with almost anything whether it was form or function related, it was still fun to toss vases at the monsters as you were trying to make a break for it. In this sequel you can open very few drawers and cabinets, and the only other objects in rooms you can move are the chairs. I know thats a nitpick but it gets worse.\n\nAfter accepting that slight change I was trying to figure out how to open the inventory. I tried looking at the controls in the game and found nothing. I then read forums that said the inventory was removed. This simplified the game too much for my taste and seemed like it only made the game more bland.\n\nWith no inventory to open I then wondered how I would check my health and sanity... then I read more up on the game. There was no sanity meter... I mean what the ♥♥♥♥ man that was half of the fun of the original. Hiding in a corner wondering if you were going to either go ♥♥♥♥ing insane from the darkness or have to turn on your lamp to relieve yourself only to have a god damned monster with googly eyes staring you down. Pick your ♥♥♥♥ing poison! It was awesome. But no, no sanity meter here more watering down of what made the predecessor so great. Oh and that's another thing... your lamp, or old timey flashlight device, has an infinte source of light. There is no oil to fill it up with or anything you have to replenish it with at all in the game. On top of that your flashlight torch lamp thingy magiggy flickers on and off when a monster is near or about to appear taking away yet more tense build up moments. Also no god damned tinderboxes. I guess it doesn't matter anyway since half of the game's envirenment is lit and you don't have a sanity meter anyway. What a crock of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe story is even more far fetched and bizarre this time around, but it's ok I had no issues with it. The monsters are pigs instead of jawless, leather bondaged, flabby ♥♥♥ white things. They act the same though so again that change is purely aesthetic. On the plus side though is awesome atmosphere of late 1800's industrial London, you get to venture through a mansion, factories, a church and catacombs, slaughterhouses, sewers, even the streets of London itself. The music was also pretty intriguing. And the graphics were obviously better being it came out nearly 3 years after the first game.\n\nOverall this game is not bad by any means. It's fun and worth playing. The problem with it is that its just a watered down version of the first game with a different setting and characters. It brings nothing new to the table gameplay wise, it only takes things away. It's worth buying on Steam if you get it during a sale I'd say, otherwise I would invest my money in another title.","June 17, 2014","false","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But the gameplay feels slow, and keeps showing hints that you are about to be lead into a terrifying area... but doesn't deliver.

I personally was all hyped up and couldn't wait for it to come out, since TDD was one of my favorite video games ever. After playing it and realizing I paid for this "game", I feel like an idiot.\n\nThere is no inventory or item management. Gone is sanity and the darkness mechanics. Basically, there are no mechanics at all, even. The only thing you do is walk down boring, empty corridors over and over again. There is no challenge, no difficulty.\n\nThis would be ok if the game was redeemed with story. However, there was no story either. In the begining, there is kind of a hint at a story. There is something starting to grow, but it gets squished by the time the game ends. The ending is pretty much just a bunch of symbolism and drama. And not in an interesting way, like Bioshock Infinite or the like, but in a "What just happened?" way. The game is also full of this silly pig motiff that doesn't really mean anything.\n\n"At least it's scary, right?" Not even close. There are only three times where the monsters can actually kill you. And even then, they can be outrun easily. They're too easy to escape. There is no tension or sense of danger. They're also pig people. When I realized they were pigs, I just let them kill me. I'm out.\n\nThe final aspect is the puzzles. I was hoping that they would be interesting, logical, fun, and challenging like in penumbra and TDD. No. They consist of physics puzzles that are way too obvious and easy.\n\n","January 6, 2014","false","5.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

After he is tricked into activating the machine,an army of manpigs are released that kill everyone on the streets.

Whilst the game they released certainly contained the excellent prose and visuals they introduced to us with their former game, I was disappointed to find A Machine for Pigs played out like a rather dull ghost train, rather than the panicky terror Frictional had accustomed me to. The entire experience was over in a few short hours, there was only two enemy encounters, and dying had no consequence other than to mysteriously erase my foe.\n\nI’m not at all against games being presented as a linear art piece to simply immerse yourself in and ride out, but when I was expecting this title to be consistent with its predecessors, I was left entirely disappointed. I imagine that I would have enjoyed my time in the belly of the beast far more had the title not bore the Amnesia moniker. This situation reminds me of the film Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001) earning a hostile reaction for not feeling like a Final Fantasy adaptation (no, calling a character Cid is not enough).\n\nI Can't Remember out of Ten","November 26, 2013","false","6.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","2"

For the love of everything good please do not waste your time it is easily the worst game I have ever played. It is a huge step down from the first and is poorly made and written. There is no threat and it is all jump-scares there is no sense of urgency or danger. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!   Its like frictional stopped trying. And the notes are nonsensical "poetry" and everything grabs desperately at the pig theme.\n\n"I went to the market, then I went home, I had some roast beef and the next I had none..." Like that was unnecessary I get that the game is about pigs you don't have to beat me over the head with pig references thanks.\n\nThis game is actual trash, it isnt scary at all.  They took the interactivity from the TDD out of it.  They took the health and sanity out of it.  The urgency of not having oil in your lamp is gone.  There is no need to be worried about if you are going to have enough light to make it through the next section of the game.  There are no tinder boxes so you dont have to worry about having enough light in certain areas of the game.  Also, there is no inventory so you dont have to worry about carring all those pesky usable items around with you.\n\nAlso, the puzzle mechanic from the first game is entirly gone. You dont have to worry about firguring anything out. It is very point A to point B.  You dont have to take any time to figure anything out, everything is haded to you on a silver platter saying, "Here you go, here is what you have to do." Whereas in TDD you have to read through notes and figure out what you are supposed to do next.\n\nAll in all the game is really poorly made and the lack of game machanics from the first game cripple this game to almost unsalvageable. I fail to find a single redemable quality in this game. Not to mention the story, virtutally unfollowable.\n\nIf you liked the first Amnesia DO NOT play the second one! Stick to 'Justine' or Custom Stories.\n\n","July 15, 2014","false","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The single player story was entertaining throughout and the puzzles were smoothly done to maintain a very flowing gameplay experience. Everything looked disgustingly gorgeous as well throughout the campaign and except a few textures that i personally would wantt a bit sharper up close when playing the looks of this game is great, so along with the sound work. Not only were the sound effects great but how the sound was used around you I do approve of, and in dark areas you rely as much on your hearing as your vision.\n\nCONS:\nHowever I do want to leave some cons in here, if you've played through the first Amnesia, this one feels a bit lacking when it comes to encounters of patrolling npcs in dark areas, there could've been more situations of this in my eyes since this is probably what most people remember the other game for. Though the story is just as solid if not better excecuted in Machine for pigs, you do feel like there could've been just more gameplay avoiding and sneaking past npcs and everything feels a bit too straight forward at times which might actually make it a bit shorter than it could've been, and the game lands in on about 3 and a half hours worth of playthrough, which I'd personally consider a bit too short to leave a greater mark.\n\nAnother thing to note that doesn't have to always be bad but does change the mechanics of the game, is that the inventory system is completely missing in this game. This leaves out things like looking for items to carry and craft, to find and fill on your oil in the lantern etc. This was a what I'd consider an important aspect of the game to make it what it was, and without it, it just feels thin.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe game is a great game by any means, and it remains on top of the line when it comes to horror/adventure games worth playing out there, but if it comes to the question "Is it better than Amnesia: Dark Descent?" My answer is,  No, it probably isn't. But if you enjoyed any of their other games I'd suggest getting this in no time since the pricetag is not too bad, and Linux support is great as well(Yes mac is for it too but who'd want to play on such crap anyway).\n\nGreat game, get it if you like Amnesia or Penumbra. Just be aware that it might be over before you know it.","September 14, 2013","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A Machine for Pigs burrows its way into Victorian fear of its own industrious brave new world, the hallmarks of futurism, and existential musings on the nature of man and evil. All of this wrapped in grimy, visceral prose, much akin to the machinery the player stalks the bowels of.\n\nBut it feels TCR overstepped their creative boundaries into what drew people in Frictional's previous titles Penumbra and The Dark Descent completely. Gone are the inventories, the limited resources, the ever-growing insanity. Your light never fails, you never need to drag an object more than twenty feet, and death is only a temporary setback. It feels almost as if Frictional had very little to do with it, aside from the Amnesia brand name and some input on nasty monstrosities out to eat the player (And these moments are very few). You will spend a lot of time walking around and listening to talking. Doesn't that seem familiar, now? Dear Esther was an experiment, one I feel failed, but dragged kicking and screaming into this long awaited project. I think Frictional were tossed to the side as nothing more than code monkeys, with the rest of the design process dominated by The Chinese Room. Do not seek a survival horror, here: Whatever plans for it have been buried by script dictation.\n\nIt's not all bad, though. If you do want the thick atmosphere of rusted, Victorian machinery, the trudging through the catabolism of our species as the anabolism of it stalks you, and finding out just what those colourful piggie masks are all about, I suppose you could do a little worse than spending the tenner to find out just what exactly lies deep beneath that meat packing plant. But if TCR want to create Dear Esther, then try to inject that piece of ♥♥♥♥ into Amnesia, then I'm going to hold it to the same criticisms: What is it, in the medium of videogames, that I could not have experienced or entertained from a good book, or an elaborate theme park ghost house? If you want to challenge the medium of videogames, you're going to have to do better than this. Take responsibility for your crusade, don't drag another's projects down with you into pretense hell.","September 11, 2013","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With all the Youtube press it recieved and barrage of indie horror games mimicking that followed. It's hard to deny it was an influential, innovative, and fantastic game. This game was a huge letdown in contrast. It's not all this game's fault however, the original Amnesia came out of nowhere as a suprise and thus I had no expectations from it other than was most likely going to be frightening to say the least. So it's hard to achieve something bigger than what the original had. That being said, I was still excited from the coverage I had been following online concerning this game so I was nonetheless pumped about it. It was a day one purchase for me out of pure faith. The opening seemed interesting to say the least but as soon as that was over and the gameplay segment had begun it didn't take long for me to notice changes in the series... changes for the worse.\n\nFirst off I almost immediately noticed you could not interact with most of the furniture and objects laying around the rooms. In the first Amenesia you could mess with almost anything whether it was form or function related, it was still fun to toss vases at the monsters as you were trying to make a break for it. In this sequel you can open very few drawers and cabinets, and the only other objects in rooms you can move are the chairs. I know thats a nitpick but it gets worse.\n\nAfter accepting that slight change I was trying to figure out how to open the inventory. I tried looking at the controls in the game and found nothing. I then read forums that said the inventory was removed. This simplified the game too much for my taste and seemed like it only made the game more bland.\n\nWith no inventory to open I then wondered how I would check my health and sanity... then I read more up on the game. There was no sanity meter... I mean what the ♥♥♥♥ man that was half of the fun of the original. Hiding in a corner wondering if you were going to either go ♥♥♥♥ing insane from the darkness or have to turn on your lamp to relieve yourself only to have a god damned monster with googly eyes staring you down. Pick your ♥♥♥♥ing poison! It was awesome. But no, no sanity meter here more watering down of what made the predecessor so great. Oh and that's another thing... your lamp, or old timey flashlight device, has an infinte source of light. There is no oil to fill it up with or anything you have to replenish it with at all in the game. On top of that your flashlight torch lamp thingy magiggy flickers on and off when a monster is near or about to appear taking away yet more tense build up moments. Also no god damned tinderboxes. I guess it doesn't matter anyway since half of the game's envirenment is lit and you don't have a sanity meter anyway. What a crock of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe story is even more far fetched and bizarre this time around, but it's ok I had no issues with it. The monsters are pigs instead of jawless, leather bondaged, flabby ♥♥♥ white things. They act the same though so again that change is purely aesthetic. On the plus side though is awesome atmosphere of late 1800's industrial London, you get to venture through a mansion, factories, a church and catacombs, slaughterhouses, sewers, even the streets of London itself. The music was also pretty intriguing. And the graphics were obviously better being it came out nearly 3 years after the first game.\n\nOverall this game is not bad by any means. It's fun and worth playing. The problem with it is that its just a watered down version of the first game with a different setting and characters. It brings nothing new to the table gameplay wise, it only takes things away. It's worth buying on Steam if you get it during a sale I'd say, otherwise I would invest my money in another title.","June 17, 2014","false","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm sure the story is good and all, but I can't get into the story because the game is so boring. The monster isn't scary looking, mostly just boring jump scares like  you see the monster run past a doorway you're about to walk through like 8 times before you actually encounter it, when you encounter it, you can pretty much escape it by walking. If you loved running and grabbing random stuff and throwing it at the monster chasing you like in the first game. You can't do that in this one. Almost all of the objects are locked in place. The puzzles are extremly easy(maybe they get harder but I got too bored and disapointed to continue playing) I tried getting into the story, and tried coming back to the game a few times but i couldn't get into it. The disapointment was too much. I know the blame isn't all on the chinese room, but I think the game would have been much better if they didn't get involved. I don't see why they replaced fun and scary gameplay with a good story instead of just having both.","October 20, 2014","false","4.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The puzzle elements are rather simple, and mainly serve as justification for going through the rooms that I would rather not go through.

The smart, yet empty, house and the networks of industrial machinery are unpleasantly eerie and set the tone nicely. Crackling radios, the creaking of valves in the distance and the solitary ring of an isolated telephone... certainly a well-crafted environment\n\nThe problem, however, is that a large portion of what made the original scary has been removed. The tinderboxes/lamp are replaced by a lantern with unlimited fuel. Whilst the new mechanic DOES get used to good effect on a few occasions - There's no longer any dread, no longer any fear and rationing. You don't lose sanity, so the darkness is more an inconvenience than a threat now. The only fear now is what you're likely to stumble upon. Unnerving, yes - but lacks the same intensity and immediate danger\n\nThe puzzles / environment interactions have also been largely stripped from the game. Whilst I appreciate looking in your inventory and collecting items might detract from the plot: It wasn't an issue before, so seems odd to remove it now. You're left with a more linear path and just having to throw switches / carry objects from A to B\n\nTruth be told, the main appeal seems to be the story... but grudgingly it doesn't do it for me. It feels reminiscent of those films where you're shouting "don't open the door you idiot!" - You're clearly going to walk into either a trap or something nasty. You're being led by a random voice calling you from the machine rooms, giving you mysterious hints and vague details... with the protagonist constantly asking where his kids are. It's wishy washy and lacks the edge to encourage you to keep going\n\nIt's still fun to play (when it doesn't crash) - but it just lacks the tension","November 30, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To it's credit, even in this short time span I went through an impressive range of emotions.  First, I was unsettled and creeped out, waking up in a bed that was surrounded by an animal cage.  Next I was curious to learn who I was and what events had led to my precarious situation.  As I picked up and read some scattered notes I felt genuinely disturbed as they described surgical experiments and mutilation.  Roaming a labyrinthian sewer, I lost my way and confusion set in.  Then somewhere along the way I got tired of looking at bricks and pipes and I got bored.\n\nThe setting of A Machine for Pigs is intriguing; taking place in London (I believe...) around the start of the industrial revolution it's the Lovecraft tropes we know and love, but in a setting that's somewhat unique for the genre.  The character you control is the owner of a meat packing business, and the advent of automated machinery to replace human workers leaves him a little obsessed with streamlining the production line.  Under his house lies impossibly complex machines of death to slaughter the livestock.  And of course by “pigs” he means humans.  His kids take to playing in these death tunnels and have an accident around the pig people.  Discovering his twin boys' demise leads your protagonist further into madness, and he becomes obsessed with bringing them back.  The underground laboratories help his quest as he feeds more blood into his machines with the promise of quenching the insatiable appetite of an elder god residing in an abyssian pyramid.  His wife died, too?  Forgive me if the details are hazy, but this is one of those “pick up the notes” types of storytelling, and it also really doesn't matter that much because it's more about the atmosphere of the game.\n\nAnd the spooky atmosphere is done rather well.  At first, anyway.  The early portions of A Machine for Pigs could reasonably be criticized for being nothing more than “boo, haunted house” jump scares, but these are quite effective and the strongest parts of the game.  Descending deeper into the earth you'd figure a darker madness awaited you, but no... it's mostly just recycled bricks and pipes and steam.  There's a real good buildup to revealing the pig-men hybrid monsters that stalk the halls, and seeing one for the first time is unnerving.  Unfortunately that's about all you're going to see in terms of monsters, and their effectiveness wears off long before the apocalyptic payoff of pigmen running rampant in the streets of London.  They become more nuisance than nightmare, obstacles between you and the solution to a simplistic puzzle you'd otherwise solve before you knew the problem.  Again, for a short game it seems like it's stretching itself too thin.\n\nI started off fairly high on Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, but as I progressed I grew less interested.  It's been awhile since I played the original Amnesia, but somehow I remember much more about that game than the one I just finished.  It's almost like... no, ♥♥♥♥ it.","October 20, 2015","false","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

There won't be huge spiders. So if you are some 15yo schoolgirl - you will like it a lot less than first game and probably will be bored in no time. This game is not about some demons, cults, monsters and castles. It's the game about greed and poverty, about love and ice cold cruelty, it's about charity and power, about family and betrayal. If you are looking for story - A Machine For Pigs easily outbeats The Dark Descent. It's a lot more dark, disturbing and unsettling game. It is a lot more intelligent game. And there is ten times more style. Though this is where it all flaws are - it is too smart for common gamer. You need to actually read and think. And A Machine for Pigs will gnaw into your ribcage.","May 28, 2014","true","8.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

While it's a beautiful wretched game, it isn't up to par compared to the other two.\n\nI won't spoil too much (though honestly the plot is even more bare bones than its predecessor) but there's a lot to take in and explore, but again, greatly simplified. There's no inventory, enemies can persue you though not very far and aren't as numerous, puzzles are rather obvious, and exploration is at a minimum.\n\nThat doesn't keep A Machine for Pigs from getting a recommendation though, while it's more limited, there's vast amounts you can leave to your twisted imagination and the scale is quite epic. The biggest thing it ends up doing wrong is making itself an Amnesia game considering its predecesors are superior in many ways. It's more of a standalone than a sequel, an episode rather than a complex game. But again, hardly a terrible thing. If you're interested, a sale would probably whet your appetite.","July 1, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Why? Well, because there's so many jumpscare horror games out there nowadays. Jump scare horror games while, yes, do scare you, are very easy to make and take minimal effort. The Chinese Room could've very easily done just this and given us a half-effort game full of cheap jumpscares. But they didn't, instead they decided to take time and make a game that will do more than give you a heart-attack, it will, instead send chills down your spine and leave you feeling disturbed long after you've finished it.\nThe atmosphere is spot on, the ambiance is great, the story is chilling and the main character is interesting and extremely complex. I won't give away details about the storyline but, if you're concerned about this game not being connected to TDD at all, it is, don't worry, you just gotta be quick enough to notice it ;). So, overall,  AAMFP is a fresh take on the Amnesia franchise and is one those games, where you honestly have to play for yourself to really develop a good opinion on it. Honestly, it's no TDD but, it's still a great game and worth a play. 7/10","December 4, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is a very streamlined version of Amnesia with all of the survival and most of the horror elements removed. However what remains is kinda very good but not reminicent of the previous game. You just kind of walk around and listen and read the well written story while listening to the excellent sound design and soundtrack. There are some enemies in the game, but they don't look very threatening and you can easily outrun them. The lack of threat and pressure is a major letdown, and while the sound design is impressive, it is at best only unnerving and not at all scary.\n\nIn true The Chinese Room fashion the game is also very artsy and pretentious and it is very lacking in its forms of engaging with the game world. That might annoy some people who just want to play something with more clearly presented story and substantial gameplay.\n\nI myself enjoyed most of the game, and I was kind of expecting something like this when I heard The Chinese Room is involved. You just need to tackle A Machine for Pigs with an open mind and not expect it to be like the original Amnesia, and maybe you'll find something to enjoy in this game.\n\nThe game gets a recommendation from me, but only barely.","September 12, 2013","true","4.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The price tag of $20.00 USD will leave the player feeling ripped off for a mere five hours of play time that comes with little to no replayability aspect; it would be best to wait for the game to go on sale on Steam, I picked up my copy for $9.99 USD.

Mne osobne ta jednoduchost ale neprekazala, ma to rychlejsi spad. Viac ale zamrzi fakt, ze objektov s ktorymi mozete interagovat je uplne minimum a spravidla su to len tie, ktore pouzit musite. Takze su prec situacie so skladanim bedni na seba, alebo ich odsuvanim k objaveniu vzacnych kresadiel, ci oleju do lampy. Tu ma lampa neobmedzenu vydrz a taktiez uz nic cestou okrem dopisov nezbierate, tym padom odpadol aj inventar. Ale ako som pisal, mne osobne to neprekazalo a k A Machine for Pigs som pristupoval ako k samostatnej hre, nie ako k pokracovaniu Amnesie a sklamany som nebol.\n\nVyssie uvedene ale bezproblemov dohana pribehom, atmosferou a hudbou.\nPribeh samotny si dovolim tvrdit, ze je zaujimavejsi, ako v pripade prvej Amnesie. Niekto by mohol sice namietat, ale mne osobne prisiel lepsi. Je taky surovejsi, tak nechutne desivejsi a donuti Vas zamysliet sa, pretoze vzdialenejsie odraza aj nasu skutocnu realitu. Atmosfera je to, co mi v tejto hre vazne nechybalo. Bol som napjaty od zaciatku az do konca a velkym dielom k tomu urcite prispeli aj zvukove efekty. Tie spolu s hudbou vytavaraju naozaj velkolepo-posobive a desive sceny.\n\nAj ked ma A Machine for Pigs s The Dark Descent uz len malo spolocneho, tak ju rozhodne doporucujem. Uz len kvoli tej zvukovej stranke ide o skvely zazitok. A nebude mat ani ziadny problem obklopit Vas strachom.

Even forced myself to like it.\nBut me, and the friends who have played the counterpart, have both agreed they took a major part away from Amnesia, namely... The Inventory\n\nThe inventory is what defined most of Amnesia, if I'm fair, holding items crucial to the story, and player development. When they took this away, they cut a major part from the story, in my opinion. You are now bound to weird phones, and dragging things along for 3 levels. (Exaggerated)\n\nThis was a major downfall for me, because the predecessor had this so well done.\n\nOne of the good things I found, is that the monsters do not dissapear after you die, but instead keep patrolling. I have got to admit, I got frustrated, but none the less, a good feature.\n\nThen on to the enemies, who help you in the cages. They are extremely dumb, and can be easily avoided by a hit-'n-run tactic. Just gotta wait your time. This was also a huge letdown for me, as they remained oblivious to you, when you already reached the next room, and gave up chasing you, thus ending in really easy enemies.\n\nI could of forgiven SO much about it, though, if it wasn't for the biggest dissapointment of all.\nThe Story\n\nThe story makes absolute zero sense, about some guy going to the Nevada desert, or whatever else got sand, coming back, getting ill, and his children have vanished, and all of a sudden pigs roam the castle. I mean, COME... ON.... This is original, yet SO crummily put together.\n\nTwo hours into the game, and I set it down, and never finished it since.\n\nIT honestly pains me to give the second part of the game, such a bad review, but this leaves me nothing else but a sad, low 2.5 in my book.\n\nAs much as I'd like to say the contrary, it's not worth the buy, if you're in for a good experience.","September 28, 2013","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Its atmosphere, sound design and graphics overall are really well done and the story told by The Chinese Room here is quite interesting as well. For $20.00 USD you really could do a lot worse, and A Machine for Pigs is certainly great quality for its price. The short comings are the fact that it is part of a series and with that comes some basic expectations which are completely removed in this installment. You won’t be dealing with insanity, inventory, lamp oil, tinderboxes; basically you won’t worry about much in this game aside from the monsters. Your lantern never runs out of energy and puzzles are fairly easy because you can only interact with so much.  You can definitely tell they focused more on the story and background than on anything else since most of it is removed. The other minuscule annoyance comes from the frequency of notes in the game. There are a ton of them, the font used in-game is sometimes a pain to read (this comes down to the individual) and a large portion of the game seems to rely on these notes.  Overall, A Machine for Pigs is a decent horror game and a good first attempt by The Chinese Room, but as an Amnesia title it is definitely a step backwards and fans of the series will walk away wanting more. This is a bit tough since the game is of great quality for the price of admission but it comes as a tough full on recommendation for  fans, and newcomers would be better served to play the previous installments before playing A Machine for Pigs.\n\n-Middle of the Road from Royial\n\nVideo Reviews can be found at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork","November 1, 2013","false","8.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

A machine for pigs has nothing in common with the first game. The major elements that made the first game successful were removed for a narrative feature that falls short of its intentions. I understand that the game world was supposed to be a giant metaphor for the title of the game but I highly doubt the average gamer/person will think that far. I was not scared/jittery/nervous/jumpy at any point during my experience mainly because when I saw the monster it looked like an emboar reject model. I thought the monster from the last game looked cheesy but this one just made me laugh every time I saw to the point where it robbed the game of the horror element for me. On top of being an inferior monster the AI on the pig monster is incredibly, I mean incredibly low. If you turn off your lantern or pick up a box (assuming you can pick one up because you can rarely interact with items in this game) and put it in front of your face the pig will sniff the air, turn around and walk away. It doesn't chase you, doesn't break down doors, it just leaves.  I may be coming across as a bit harsh but when trying to build on a previous success and use the same name/title when creating it certain expectations are put on it. That said this shouldn't have been called an amnesia title and should have been a standalone game. Overall their is nothing wrong with the game itself, its is playable and the mechanics work (though it is incredibly short). I wouldn't pay full price for this and give it a 6/10.","January 12, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story makes very little sense until the very end where it's all explained to you by... you know... the voices in your head that turn out to be you and even then you're staring at the screen going; "How the ♥♥♥♥ was I supposed to cobble THAT together out of what you gave me???", there's a TON of wonky symbolism, which wouldn't be SO bad if it wasn't all PIG related and they didn't beat you to death with itthen there's the fact that there is ONE type of monster in it (SPOILER ALERT they're PIGS) and they are so DUMB AND SLOW that literally the only way they can kill you is if you corner yourself.\n\nIn the first one if the mobs find you, you have literally 5 seconds or less to get the HELL out of sight and hide before they mow you down. Now that may SOUND like the worse of the two options but this is a HORROR GAME. It's not scary unless there's a sense of danger which doesn't exist if you're not afraid of the mobs. At that point the only threat is jump scares where you go "WAHHHHHH! OHGODWHATSTHAT!?! Oh never mind it's just Babe. That'll do pig. *pats and walks away* ".\n\nOver all, it's not scary and you get the feeling they focused too much on the shock value of the pig aspects and forgot about storyline until a few hours before the deadline. If you played and liked the first one, DO NOT play this one. You WILL be disappointed and you WILL regret spending the money.","March 13, 2015","false","6.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It displayed a unique spin on madness, refreshing the usual plot of mass destruction found in such games. However the "big reveal" is quite obvious from pretty much the beginning and the mechanics of the game were a bit of a letdown. Where The Dark Descent added enough environmental interaction to make you unsure if what you were picking up was a part of the puzzle or just another box, A Machine For Pigs only allows for the movement of objects related to the puzzles, making it to be a tad predictable and linear.\n\nOtherwise I’d highly recommend playing if you want to sit back and enjoy the ride, especially if Steampunky science if your thing.\n","November 23, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

While the theme and the story are great, they have hindered many of the original game's key features.\n1. You have no inventory. You no longer need to scavenge and explore to find tinderboxes, oil for your lantern (now electric), or any of the items you need to progress. This was one of the best parts of the first Amnesia. There was a sense of helplessness and vulnerability when you had to find all of the parts to make a potion or to fix a machine while your lamp was running out. This game is incredibly dumbed down.\n\n2. Notes aren't voice acted anymore. Not that big of a deal, I know, but I really enjoyed all the extra effort that was prevalent in the first one when Daniel would read the notes to you, which made him seem more alive.\n\n3. The game just isn't that scary. Probably the biggest dissapointment of all. The monsters in the trailer and teaser for the game made them look terrifying. In reality, all they are are pigs that freak out and walk quickly towards you, and they are easy to lose. And there aren't even that many! The creepy and eerie factor that the story brought you is there, minus the jump scares.\n\nI really hope that they make a third that will really quench my thirst for the horror series, but for now, I think I'll stick with the first one.","December 24, 2013","false","6.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Wow, was I wrong. I beat the game in under 2 hours the first time and then proceeded to play it two more times all the way through before uninstalling it. (I have 4 hours on record at this time). This game was simply too easy. They limited the things you could interact with to items that were significant to the puzzles or the back story. NOTHING ELSE! You couldn't even pick up a chair. To make things worse, out of the 5 or so encounters with the monsters, every single one of them was very easy to pass, seeing as they would only chase you in a certain (VERY small) area and couldn't even do things such as break down doors. Dying was also easily avoidable because it took the monsters up to 5 hits to kill you. If you still aren't convinced, they took away the oil lantern and replaced it with a lantern that NEVER runs out. Not only that, but you no longer have an insanity level, so run around in the dark and stare at the monsters to your hearts content. I wont go in depth with the story, but I will say that the ending was not worth the little amount of game time it takes to reach it. It leaves you with too many questions and includes a small twist that most people will see coming. As for getting this game yourself? NO! Never!

I was expecting the whole hog and all I got was scrawny pork chops. While I can't recommend-recommend the game, I wouldn't say don't play it. Just expect to feel a little empty inside afterwards, especially if you liked the first game.\n\nLong Review: I am a fan of the first Amnesia game. It had a fantastic setting, dark and gritty and wonderfully oppressive. And it had an interesting lead and while Daniel was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you could feel for the guy. You got to get inside of his head, got to feel his fear, experience his unknowing at what was going on. You and Daniel got to experience the game together (him with fresh eyes at the horrors he did, you; the player, progressing through the story). And it was a good game. A great game even: Simple enough of a story that it wasn't overly complex and yet engaging.\n\nThen came Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. When I first started to follow the game's production, I was thrilled that they were making a sequel. I didn't know where they would take the game, since the endings to the first one left little wiggle room for a second, but I was eager all the same. Then I learned Fractional Games wasn't making it. I started to feel a little uneasy about the game then. But it would be alright, right? They wouldn't just hand off one of their titles off to someone that didn't know what they were doing, right?\n\nThen I heard the Chinese Room was making it. Now, when I learned this, I had just finished playing one of their other games "Dear Ester" (Just...biggest waste of money -ever-). Now I started to feel some real dread. I worried about what the game would hold, but I decided to try and keep an open mind.\n\nSo when it came out, and I played it, I liked it well enough as I was going through it: The environment was lovely and the little glimpses of the main's children were a nice creepy touch. But then the ending to the game came and I started to feel unsatisfied. And afterwards: Unhappy. The story was complex in the worst possible way. The character's internal narrative bogged down the story, making it difficult to follow in some places and in the end, I felt no sympathy towards him. I was glad he died, he deserved it, no matter how much the game wanted to put some sort of Jekyll and Hyde twist on him.\n\nI also missed the insanity meter, which meant I could stare at something disturbing until the cows came home and Oswald wouldn't get disturbed by it even a little. (Of course, an in game reason is that Oswald is -maybe- more mentally sound then Daniel-I'll-just-♥♥♥♥-my-pants-now, but even that doesn't make much sense since just being in the presence of the Orb broke him, While Daniel managed to at least retain his relative sanity until he was pushed to the point he feared for his life and was willing to do ANYTHING to save it)\n\nAnyway: The game was not good. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either and not a good follow up to Amnesia: The Dark Decent. It might have done a little better if it didn't carry the tag "Amnesia", perhaps my hopes wouldn't have been so high, but overall, I can't recommend the game on the merit of a bogged down story, unsympathetic and uninteresting characters, and unsatisfactory game play (It's "Dear Ester + Mild Horror elements" really). I will recommend the game though on its visuals and interesting setting though.","February 16, 2014","false","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gone is the sanity system, and with it much of the tension that comes with encountering foes.  And last but certainly not least, gone is the ability to explore and fully interact with the environment.  99% of the objects you encounter can't be interacted with, i.e. you can't open most cabinets, go off the beaten path, scour for interesting items that enhance the story, none of that.  I don't know where certain reviewers are coming from when they talk about how great the atmosphere is in this game.  When you're surrounded by the exact same objects as the first Amnesia game, yet you can't touch them or explore for some reason, it pulls you straight out of the game world.  Side note: I have a very powerful system which can run Amnesia: The Dark Descent at full settings at 60fps... it would seem that The Chinese Room didn't do a very job of making this a stable game on top of it all because this game runs like garbage.  It's hard to be consumed by the atmosphere of the game when you can barely do anything and it's glitching all the time.\n\nBut on to the story.  Simply put, it's crap.  It focuses so heavily on the "pig" metaphor that after a while, you'll grow tired of hearing the word.  The voice acting is weak and the dialogue and scattered notes are pretentious.  The Dark Descent had such style and such a rich story.  This game seems to me like an uninspired cash-in.\n\nListen to all the other reviews.  Stick to The Dark Descent and if you've beat that, get your hands on Outlast.

You only have one ending, you don't have an invetory (which is a little annoying sometimes, since you have to carry things around), you don't have to worry about your lantern running out, the monsters are easily outrun most of the time and you can literally stand and wait for them to hit you before you walk away and you're still fine.

This game is not bad. It's not terrible. It's actually decently scary. The problem is, since it's called Amnesia, you have to compare it to the game that came before. THAT'S where the negative opinions come from. This game isn't broken, or boring, or unscary. It just doesn't come close to reaching the bar set by The Dark Descent. The first Amnesia game wasn't expected to be such a huge success. It was released when Let's Plays were becoming popular, so it gained it's cult hit status through that. This left Frictional Games in a situation where they needed to pump out a sequal that met this expectations they were unprepared for. So they asked for help. Chinese Room is great at atmosphere and enviornments, which this game has in spades. However the horror element is lacking. The monsters are scary for one or two encounters (Of the only seven the game actually has) and once you figure out you can outrun and outsmart them, they stop being a source of terror. The puzzles were simple in the first game, but they are ridiculous now. It barely ever goes beyond "Pick this up and carry it to this to continue," and they are few and far between anyway. They only people I wouldn't recommend this game to are people who still hold The Dark Descent on it's (deserved) throne of "Best Horror Game Ever."

In the game you have no inventory system, infinite lamp juice, no scavaging, not so horrifying monsters, and pointless puzzles. It basically is a walking simulator where you just walk and walk and pull levers and spin valves and continue walking. The game is not that scary at all so all the jump scares n all are just not in the game. Only a few things I liked about this game was the mapping and the story. The story was so interesting and great that their main focus was on that than focusing on more gameplay. It's nice to explore the maps like in Dear Esther, but the gameplay is still lacking. There is no point calling it an Amneisa game if it doesnt have what TDD had. It's not about how great the story or mapping is it's about the feel of the game. The feel of being helpless and trying to survive the terror of the monsters who are hunting you down. There is no custom stories for this and even if their was it would still not make up for the lack of gameplay.\n\n6/10. Stay with Amneisa: TDD and people might port the ♥♥♥♥ from this game into the TDD custom stories.

I played both games in the Amnesy series ("A dark descent" (AdD) and "A machine for pigs" (AmfP)) and I completely enjoyed the ride in each one of them.\nBoth games are similar in their mechanics, but not exactly the same. In AdD there are more puzzles to solve and things to interact with such as light sources or flasks, or to look after, namely health and sanity. Most of these elements are not present in AmfP which, all in all, made me feel it somewhat closer to a walking simulator than its predecesor. At least, for a good number of chapters in the plot from the beginning. However, I think Jessica Curry's score is, hands down, a huge bonus in this second game in the series. Both games really hit the spot in terms of ambiance, spooky effects and a plot that keeps you glued to the screen to the end. Besides, the fact that all you can do against wandering monsters is to avoid them (or run for your life when they actually detect you) really gave me the creeps every time I run into one of them. From this point of view, AdD is more effective in giving you gooseflesh. However, if you immerse yourself in the plot (especially by reading all the notes and/or diary entrances) and especially in the ambiance both games proved me to be a very rewarding experience.","January 31","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The ONE chase scene wasn't even scary and lasted for nearly 3 seconds. The monsters are just big pigs with human like traits. The game is more puzzle and search and find rather than horror. But the story is actually good.\n\nAs a horror game 2/10\nIt has the setting and all to have potential but is ruined by loading framrate lags and lack of actually threats. Also the survival inventory was removed and was replaced by an infinite fuel lantern and regenerating health for if you somehow get hurt. No laudenaum (sorry for my butchering of the spelling) or oil. Really not hard to "survive" in the game. Now in real life playing the game it is hard to survive through it because it is just so damn boring.

Constant walking around trying to find where to go and a lot of backtracking.

After receiving some praise from critics, the Youtube crowd took an instant liking to the game. It became a staple of letsplayers screaming and fans requesting to see their idols scared.\n\nHopes for a sequel were high and the announcement that "A Machine for Pigs" would follow in the footsteps of The Dark Descent got people hopeful. The end result, for some reason, disappointed a lot of fans.\n\nMaybe this has more to do with me not truly seeing Amensia for many years, but I found Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs to be great. It certainly is different from Dark Descent, but it's no less tense or solid.\n\nA Machine for Pigs deals with some incredibly disturbing and dark subject matter. This is almost the video game equivalent to that ridiculous scene in Pink Floyd's "The Wall" where kids are fed into a meat grinder. The plot line follows the dimentia of a man who obtains the orb from the previous game and goes insane.\n\nTo write it all out would utterly ruin the intrigue and mystery that surrounds every inch of this game. So I'll stop there and talk more about the game itself. Following in the vein of developer TheChineseRoom's previous game, Dear Esther, A Machine for Pigs is more about crafting and presenting a gripping narrative then it is with scares and gameplay.\n\nThere are still puzzles and enemies to deal with, but it's far simpler then before. Your interactivity with the world is cut down dramatically, so puzzles stop being about logic and deal more with you noticing an object on the ground. It's kind of sad, as I loved the mind teasers that were peppered throughout Dark Descent.\n\nThe enemy design is outstanding, but their AI is mostly the same (if not worse) then before. The Pig guards will run at you, but they can easily be outrun or simply dodged by shutting off your latern. It makes for moments that are definitely intense, but lack the kind of frailty that was so prevalent in Dark Descent.\n\nThat and a lot of the situations (both in puzzles and enemy encounters) feel like repeats of the first game. You get a similar confrontation with a water beast and often have to insert cogs and turn wheels to get the ball rolling. Towards the end of the game, you ride so many elevators that it almost becomes comical.\n\nThe presentation of everything is what really sells this. The graphics are nice and sharp and the music is just wonderful. A lot of scenes become transcendental in nature simply because of how every elements comes together. While the game doesn't ditch the diary pages from before, it's main narrative isn't hidden away by static screens.\n\nYou get constant narration from your character and some interaction with the game's antagonist. The voice overs are more compelling then the previous game and the plot takes an unexpected turn that packs a real punch at the finale. It's mesmerizing and makes for a great time.\n\nMy main gripe is just that a lot of the gameplay is stripped out. I loved exploring each environment in Dark Descent and figuring out how to progress. A Machine for Pigs is linear to a fault. Even in a big city, you only have one path to go on. Dark Descent reveled in giving you multiple things to do with no set guideline.\n\nThat aside, the overall package is just awesome. It may not be any more horror filled then it's predecessor, but it's definitely a worthy follow-up and a good experience. If you love dark, twisted fantasy, then don't pass this up.\n\n8/10","October 31, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/disscravis/recommended/239200/","disscravis","disscravis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/disscravis/","42 products in account","I'm so very conflicted about this game. Like many, I came in expecting a proper follow-up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. That game set some extraordinarily high expectations, none of which are fulfilled in this sequel. Where the first game provided an ample amount of terror thru the use of clever level design, interesting puzzle-solving and a haunting atmosphere, A Machine For Pigs decides to ditch everything but the atmosphere. You won't find any difficult puzzles in AMfP; in fact, I can only think of one time where I barely had to use my brain to progress thru the narrative. The rest of the story is largely an on-rails narrative, in the realm of an interactive novel rather than a video game. Having played The Chinese Room's Gone Home, I had a feeling that the follow-up to Amnesia: The Dark Descent would be more focused on story-telling. I had no idea how strictly that model would come to define the folow-up to one of video gaming's greatest horror tales. A Machine For Pigs is a beautiful narrative, enanced by moody lighting and an emotionally stirring soundtrack. Though I was very dissapointed to find that many features from the first game were removed - namely, the sanity meter and the necessity to manage resources - I still found this game enjoyable and satisyfing. My best advice for enjoying this game is to understand that this is NOT a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent in any stretch of the imagination. It is a stand-alone narrative featuring entirely new characters and a new setting. The gameplay mechanics are severely lscking, even compared to the minimal interaction compared to the first game, However if you are looking to try something different, and enjoy a good horror story, then A Machine for Pigs is worth your time and money. Just not $20 of it.","November 1, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has some obvious problems, mostly to do with the linearity and lack of puzzles. Perhaps this was a choice by The Chinese Room, who made the snorefest "Dear Escher." On the other hand, it's not like the puzzles in Dark Descent were actually GOOD. So, if you're after the same thing I'm after--impeccable set design full of dark winding passages and horrifying creatures lurking just out of sight--you'll be pleased once again. In fact, this game has something that Dark Descent was lacking: a truly striking and effective story. It makes a surprisingly big difference, I found, grounding the protagonist's goals in a search for his missing children. And once you discover the true nature of the evil lurking in the tunnels under London, it will give you a lot more to think about than the rituals of Alexander ever did in Dark Descent.","November 1, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/recommended/239200/","scrubsauce","Scrubsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scrubsauce/","394 products in account","I went into Machine for Pigs (MfP) with a bit of static in my ears.  My friends who had played the game gave me a very mixed feel on the game, plenty of negative to go with the positive, so I went in with somewhat lowered expectations.  I played Dark Descent years ago, and the Penumbra trilogy more recently, and right out of the gate it was obvious that though this game shared the Amnesia moniker, it was not a Frictional endeavour.\n\nThe only Chinese Room game I've played before was Dear Esther, and as much flak as that game receives I found enjoyment in the atmosphere the developers were able to build into such a short experience.  MfP helps the developers carry on that trend, but it gives them much more breathing room.  The extended length (~4-7 hours depending on your hurry) plays to the developers' favor and shows they can make a full length experience with a beginning, middle, and end.  The world MfP builds for the player is as much a social commentary on recent human history as it is a spooky romp through underground, industrial revolution England with tons of pig-based imagery.  While the ties to Dark Descent are minimal and fleeting, MfP manages to stand on its own as a new narrative in a new setting with new characters and still be captivating.  However, if you don't listen closely to the various notes and conversations scattered throughout the campaign, things can get a little confusing.  Even after beating the game I found myself googling portions of the plot to get a better understanding of what had just happened.\n\nThe main complaint I see/hear for MfP is that the horror pales in comparison to Dark Descent and I'm inclined to agree.  While Dark Descent terrified me from beginning to end, MfP suffers from the same issues as the Slender series in that after a certain point, prolonged exposure to the intiially "mysterious" creepies haunting you makes them significantly less mysterious, and minimizes their ability to inspire terror in the player.  However, I don't feel like it was Chinese Room's intent for the monsters to be the source of horror the whole way through the game.  Without going into plot spoilers, the narrative makes it a point to expose the monsters to the player to help make sense of the plot, and the horror stops being this abstract thing going bump in the night to an internal sense of fear and anxiety over the actions of the player.\n\nWith that last statement in mind, I can totally agree with the Bioshock comparisons.  MfP is every bit as deep as Bioshock Infinite, without the paradoxical nature of the protagonist running around gunning down hundreds of NPC's for the sake of AAA gun-play mechanics.\n\nSo if you're interested in an Irrational-style mind-trip, MfP is the game for you.  Just don't go in expecting to be scared out of your wits the whole way through.","November 3, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The first Amnesia was published AND created by Frictional Games. Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a great horror game, but not as great as Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This has several reasons:\n1. You have unlimited light\n2. No health is shown, but mosty 2 hits are enough to kill you.\n3. Everytime you meet an enemy, your lamp and the lights nearby start to flicker. So you will be warned if something dangerous is near you. That's the point I have to critisize. A horror game shouldn't warn you of horror things, it must surprise you! If I get warned all the time then I won't be so scared because I know some pig is waiting there. I want to move without knowing what awaits me in the next corner.\n4. No inventory for items, because you don't have to activate your brain and collect and combine different items anymore!\n-> 5. Really easy puzzles, you can't compare it with the first Amnesia.\n6. The story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent was better and a little bit longer than in this one. You just play a psychopath who has deep psycho-problems with himself... The whole game is about himself and his noob-life.\n\nBut now to the good points:\nIt is still a very good horror game. If you loved Amnesia: The Dark Descent, you will like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. But the first Amnesia was a lot scarier and harder. Anyway, definitely a good game and I hope the next Amnesia will be developed and published by Frictional Games. :P","November 9, 2013","true","6.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is not scary at all. Unless you have a grudge against pigmen, or you're not too familiar with the horror genre; this game and it's atmosphere are simply not frightening. In fact, listening to this would be more scarier: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8E1_YbypkQ&feature=player_detailpage\n\nAnyway, about the game... When thinking about TDD, everyone seems to talk about how atmospheric and scary the game was. For me, it was the story that ultimately caught my attention. So much that it was worth buying it again, and replaying it for the story alone. With AMFP, I bought it for the same reasons. Except, where TDD excelled, AMFP seemed to have falled behind completely.\n\nThe story in AMFP was rather lackluster, and sadly predictable. Nothing in the game felt new and or exciting. Storywise, it's narative definitely harkens back to classic horror literature. Allowing the player to imagine these situations, as oppossed to seeing them. But with the game's rapid pacing, and very graphic auditory descriptions; this game felt more like a modern day horror, that focuses on more "gore" than atmosphere.\nPlaying AMFP's story just felt like a mix between Afterfall InSanity and BioShock. For the most part, the game was like the first part of BioShock. Except, where BioShock continued, AMFP just ends. Which got me wishing there was more after "the end.". And without spoiling anything, Afterfall InSanity did a much better job at telling a similar story, imo.\n\nAs for gameplay, it was surprisingly poor. Gameplay was very minimal compared to TDD. Gone is the object interaction (which doesn't really affect gameplay); the inventory (so there is no "survival" concept); the oil lamp (now it's a lantern with unlimited energy); and the enviorment puzzles, which made TDD much more than just a "scary game." What really felt missing however, was the whole stealth game mechanic that TDD had.\nNo longer do you need to run away from the monsters, or quickly find the hiding place. In AMFP, it's all about observing the pigmens' walk pattern, and hiding from them. Sounds the same, except there are no "hiding places." The AI was also dumb and ridiculous. In fact, you could just simply run in circles and they still won't catch you. You could even sneak up to them, without them noticing. It also takes a few hits for most of the pigmen to actually kill you, which doesn't really help the game's cause.\n\nOverall, AMFP is not worth the $20 or $15 price, even for the story. I'd say, for less than $5, sure. Besides, this is a short game with lag issues here and there. You can even find TDD custom stories that are much more worthwhile than AMFP.","September 30, 2013","false","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you go in expecting Amnesia: The Dark Descent 2 then you'll ultimately be disappointed, but if you approach it in the spirit of Dear Esther and Korsakovia with a side order of Amnesia then you'll be more likely to gain something from the experience.\n\nVery atmospheric, thanks mainly to the incredible sound design that sounds like something ripped out of David Lynch's Eraserhead and The Elephant Man. Plenty of scares, but perhaps not as much real danger or a sense of urgency as the narrative otherwise implies.\n\nThe narrative is largely driven by notes and audio logs, so if you miss some of them (easy to do) then you may find yourself missing a few pieces of the puzzle.\n\nThe end sequence is way too long and protracted (I found myself rushing through the last hour or so) but everything that comes before is well worth experiencing.","September 14, 2013","true","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not really all that scary when compared to the harrowing experience of its predecessor, Amnesia: Dark Descent, or the pure terror of the recently released Outlast, A Machine for Pigs deals more in psychologically disturbing stuff than in-your-face boogeymen and buckets of guts.\n\nIt's only halfway successful though, since I didn't really enjoy it as much as the other games I've mentioned. The story is intriguing, but the puzzles are way too easy and enemy encounters are few and far between. Graphically, the Frictional Engine is starting to show its age as well, however sound design and music are great.\n\nOverall, A Machine for Pigs is a slight disappointment, especially if you're expecting a ride similar to the original Amnesia.","September 11, 2013","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even half the reviews from Dark Descent fans here don't like it.\n\nHere is 90% of the game:\n\n1. Walk around empty environment looking for a level/valve to pull to open up a door to advance.\n2. Every 5 minutes, an earthquake or meaningless ambient sound or pointless voiceover flashback will cause the screen to go blurry and slow your character to a crawl for a couple seconds.\n\nThat's it. I'm not joking. That's almost the entire game. There aren't even any items, inventory, or resources to worry about. I would have been fine with this since that aspect of Dark Descent annoyed me, but they didn't replace it with anything interesting here. There are free horror Flash games with more depth and interaction.\n\nEven though I didn't like Dark Descent, at least there was  the interest in pushing forward in order to find out why your character was in this environment. You had amnesia with a note from yourself telling you to kill some man, and you spend the game finding out why. In Machine for Pigs, you have a plot that's pointlessly obtuse only to distract you from how boring it is. Your character wakes up and mumbles something about the children running into the basement where apparently you set up an industrialized slaughter house. Most of the notes and journals you pick up are confusing and worthless to sheddding any light on anything. They're just there to waste your time and try to trick you into thinking there's some DEEP MEANING to this pretentious naval gazing nonsense.\n\nJust worthless. HOW bad is it? I honestly think this might be a worse atmospheric walking simulator than Gone Home.

There is little suspense and I never once felt the intensity of Dark Decent in Machine for Pigs. Chinese Room should stick to games like Esther. They totally failed with this game in my opinion.","October 23, 2015","false","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a  2-3 hours walking simulator, with no exploration, plain stupid story and multiple technical issues.\n\nFirst of, It's not a horror. I've noticed attempts to scare me (I think ?). But enemies are hilariously bad designed, have nonexistent AI and completely broken animations.\nI'm serious, first time I had a good look at the enemy, I chuckled, because how stupid he looked.\n\nThere is no real threat, 90% of the time enemy will run past you and vanish into thin air. By the way, once I saw an enemy just popping into existence. The "scare script" was so obvious, that before pulling a lever I looked at a place where they could appear, and BAM - He just spawned.\nThere is also an invisible water monster. Because hey! It worked in Dark Descent, right ?\n\nStory is baaaad and boooring. Half of it is predictable as hell, the second half is just idiotic. Main hero is an idiot... at that would be all. There not much of it in this game.\n\nGameplay is really simple. Hold W and walk through a corridor. You can't pick up objects, open doors, explore. If an enemy is chasing you, hold W and SHIFT. Sometimes you will have to pull a lever. That's... fun?\n\nGame will constantly force you to listen to bad voice acting. And while you main hero have an inner monologue, everything will blur and slow down (and your mouse sensitivity will change). It's really annoying.\nAlso for some reason, everything have a blue tint. It doesn't make any sense. It will also, randomly lock itself to 40 FPS for a minute and then go back to 60. (I think it's autosave?)\n\nMusic is decent.. at least some parts of it.\n\n\nOverall, it's terrible. Don't waste your time and money. If you are REALLY interested about it, go to wiki and read a synopsis of the story. It's 11 lines of text...","April 6, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The puzzles are pretty boring and easy, the whole game is linear (whereas The Dark Descent had many rooms and the puzzles were pretty intricate). The gameplay is much more boring, the insanity meter is gone and there's no more inventory, meaning that there's no lamp oil or tinderboxes, making the game much less tense. The ambiance is still scary, but the enemies are more dopey than disturbing, which deflates the situation when you're being chased by one. The one saving grace for this game was the horribly disturbing but cool as ♥♥♥♥ story, but...it's 3 hours long. I think this game could've been so much better than it was, especially given the success of its predecessor.

First of all, they sent this game's almighty creation kit over to the fine artsy peoples at the chineeseroom. ((in)famous for their previous game, Dear Esther) Second of all, it's not scary. Sure, there may be a slight tad of tension near the beginning and all, but midway through the game falls straight on it's face and becomes Walking Silmulator 2013. And in that regard, this game is the best Walking Silmulator of the year.\n\nWith that said, the game still has an overarching atmosphere and top-notch writing. Which is great, because much like the atmosphere which is good and in-your-face, the writing is good and always-in-your-face-why-hello-there. You'll constantly be hearing Mandus write frequently in his wee diary about everything. From "I pulled a lever!" to "I believe there is a monster near (there never is) #scared #omg," the sound of the game notifying you about his endeavors will strike the most fear into your heart.\n\nThe monsters, unlike the first game, are non-existant. Whle this may seem happy to those who bought new pants during the first game, there is no tension because the game is WS2013. Straight line. So straight infact, I almost lost myself when I made a corner, only for the game to have a beautifully shokcing hand-arrow-pointy sign. Alright, back on monsters it is. They're weak. They're pitiful. Gadly though they're quite revolting, the idea of them is scarier than they actually are ingame- however, it is Mandus who should be weak and pitiful (well, I guess they can pull a Daniel AGAIN.) and instead you are Mr. Universe, who can take a hit like you ain't got no time to hurt. It's no wonder how (minimal spoilers to a dead ended room!) you can fall almost 30 feet into a shallow pool of poo and survive. (spoilers done!) Speaking of which, there is no gameplay. This should have been obvious before when I called it WS2013, but I'm going to point it out anyways, becuase unlike the other best Walking Silmulators out there, it doesn't let you do what you normally could on a walk. There is no inventory no oil no lighters no health and no sanity. Without any of those, exploring has no depth and beauty which can never match the first game. In fact, I beat the whole thing in 4-5 hours. Others claim 3 hours! They must be hacking. The no sanity part leads me to believe Mandus is alrady insane, but clearly he's sane, otherwise we'd be playing a game in which you jump on little brown animals, eat mushrooms and go into sewers for red plastic coins.\n\n\nHave I gotten everything that needs to be in a review? Hmmm. I think the review fits to a tee. And so, I'd like to talk about how I sweat throughout my playthrough. Not because of fear, but because of it being the best Walking Silmulator of the Year. WS2013 FTW, people. FTW.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS- I recommend this game, as best Walking Silmulator of the Year. I think the chineseroom has created a new genre, and should be experienced by all as they are the genre defining people. Thanks for reading! Stay tuned, for I'll be reviewing The Stanley Parable next!","December 1, 2013","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved the first one.  I eagerly started  playing and realized nothing was happening.  I did not encounter a dangerous monster until a couple hours in.  I even laughed at it.  I see people argue that this game has horror elements towards others that found it to be weak.  Abrupt loud noises and a flickering light while something runs by is not scarey.  If it does not cause you anxiety to walk around that dark corner without fear of having your face ripped off, it is not scarey.  This game was not scarey.  I roamed the halls generally care free with a flashlight that never died, health that would renew and a serious lack of danger to worry about.  It had some decent story elements, and a lot of detail went into the machinery, but the game itself was just not fun.  If you have not played the first one, please do not buy the 2nd.  I wouldn't want you to miss out on an actual good game because of utter disgust for "a machine for pigs".","September 12, 2013","false","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krakenlord/recommended/239200/","krakenlord","Kraken Lord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krakenlord/","256 products in account","While you may think this is the next best horror game from the boys (and girls?) over at Frictional Games, you'd be wrong. First of all, they sent this game's almighty creation kit over to the fine artsy peoples at the chineeseroom. ((in)famous for their previous game, Dear Esther) Second of all, it's not scary. Sure, there may be a slight tad of tension near the beginning and all, but midway through the game falls straight on it's face and becomes Walking Silmulator 2013. And in that regard, this game is the best Walking Silmulator of the year.\n\nWith that said, the game still has an overarching atmosphere and top-notch writing. Which is great, because much like the atmosphere which is good and in-your-face, the writing is good and always-in-your-face-why-hello-there. You'll constantly be hearing Mandus write frequently in his wee diary about everything. From "I pulled a lever!" to "I believe there is a monster near (there never is) #scared #omg," the sound of the game notifying you about his endeavors will strike the most fear into your heart.\n\nThe monsters, unlike the first game, are non-existant. Whle this may seem happy to those who bought new pants during the first game, there is no tension because the game is WS2013. Straight line. So straight infact, I almost lost myself when I made a corner, only for the game to have a beautifully shokcing hand-arrow-pointy sign. Alright, back on monsters it is. They're weak. They're pitiful. Gadly though they're quite revolting, the idea of them is scarier than they actually are ingame- however, it is Mandus who should be weak and pitiful (well, I guess they can pull a Daniel AGAIN.) and instead you are Mr. Universe, who can take a hit like you ain't got no time to hurt. It's no wonder how (minimal spoilers to a dead ended room!) you can fall almost 30 feet into a shallow pool of poo and survive. (spoilers done!) Speaking of which, there is no gameplay. This should have been obvious before when I called it WS2013, but I'm going to point it out anyways, becuase unlike the other best Walking Silmulators out there, it doesn't let you do what you normally could on a walk. There is no inventory no oil no lighters no health and no sanity. Without any of those, exploring has no depth and beauty which can never match the first game. In fact, I beat the whole thing in 4-5 hours. Others claim 3 hours! They must be hacking. The no sanity part leads me to believe Mandus is alrady insane, but clearly he's sane, otherwise we'd be playing a game in which you jump on little brown animals, eat mushrooms and go into sewers for red plastic coins.\n\n\nHave I gotten everything that needs to be in a review? Hmmm. I think the review fits to a tee. And so, I'd like to talk about how I sweat throughout my playthrough. Not because of fear, but because of it being the best Walking Silmulator of the Year. WS2013 FTW, people. FTW.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS- I recommend this game, as best Walking Silmulator of the Year. I think the chineseroom has created a new genre, and should be experienced by all as they are the genre defining people. Thanks for reading! Stay tuned, for I'll be reviewing The Stanley Parable next!","December 1, 2013","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The atmosphere isn't as intense as other horror games and there aren't as many enemies which will kill you easily.

Even half the reviews from Dark Descent fans here don't like it.\n\nHere is 90% of the game:\n\n1. Walk around empty environment looking for a level/valve to pull to open up a door to advance.\n2. Every 5 minutes, an earthquake or meaningless ambient sound or pointless voiceover flashback will cause the screen to go blurry and slow your character to a crawl for a couple seconds.\n\nThat's it. I'm not joking. That's almost the entire game. There aren't even any items, inventory, or resources to worry about. I would have been fine with this since that aspect of Dark Descent annoyed me, but they didn't replace it with anything interesting here. There are free horror Flash games with more depth and interaction.\n\nEven though I didn't like Dark Descent, at least there was  the interest in pushing forward in order to find out why your character was in this environment. You had amnesia with a note from yourself telling you to kill some man, and you spend the game finding out why. In Machine for Pigs, you have a plot that's pointlessly obtuse only to distract you from how boring it is. Your character wakes up and mumbles something about the children running into the basement where apparently you set up an industrialized slaughter house. Most of the notes and journals you pick up are confusing and worthless to sheddding any light on anything. They're just there to waste your time and try to trick you into thinking there's some DEEP MEANING to this pretentious naval gazing nonsense.\n\nJust worthless. HOW bad is it?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaocrat/recommended/239200/","kaocrat","kaocrat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaocrat/","259 products in account","Short summary: don't buy it or play it. Not worth your time or your money. Oh, you want to know why? I'll lay out some points below, but in brief: they removed or botched every distinguishing characteristic of the previous Amnesia game (and Frictional Games in general), and replaced those characteristics with . . . nothing. What you're left with is a series of spooky but poorly realized environments and a scenario/story which has a lot of potential but isn't fleshed out or conveyed very effectively. If you love the original Amnesia, play it again. Or play one of the fan-made scenarios (there are some great ones). Or play the Penumbra games (they're very very good). Just don't play A Machine for Pigs.\n\nThings you should know about A Machine for Pigs:\n\n• Lots of cut and paste art assets. You'll see the same paintings, desk lamps, sacks of inexplicably fresh potatoes, chairs, desks, barrels, crates, and wall textures everywhere. This would be fine in a 1st person shooter or something where environment is secondary, but inexcusable in atmospheric horror where you are supposed to be piecing a story together based on environmental cues.\n\n• No interactivity. In the original Amnesia and other games by Frictional, you could pick up most small objects, open every drawer and cupboard, and push around most larger objects even if you couldn't lift them. In addition to being the basis for some great puzzles, the physics system created a much-needed sense of *presence* and gave life to the environments. (Rooting through a pile of rubble, throwing items off to the side, to find a useful item underneath, is more engaging than clicking on an item sitting on a shelf, for example.)  You can’t even jump on top of most low objects nor crawl under most gaps.\n\nIn Machine for Pigs, you can pick up chairs, and you can open *some* desk drawers and doors. That's about it, except for puzzle-specific objects. Most egregiously, the game is full of "doors" and "cabinets" which you cannot interact with in any way. In Dark Descent, you could try to open one and it would at least rattle and maybe you'd get a message that it's locked. In this game? Nothing. Your cursor doesn't even change when you mouse over the door or cabinet. It's basically a wall with a door texture on it. This reduces the game to a "pixel hunt" where you move your cursor over every object and surface in a room to figure out which thing is interactive (usually nothing is).\n\n• No inventory. There are no items to collect, examine, combine, and use to solve puzzles. There are no tinder boxes for lighting torches, and your lantern never runs out of oil so there is no need to find lantern oil. Not a problem on its own, but combined with lifeless, non-interactive environments and it means there's nothing to actually *do* in this game.\n\n• No game mechanics. No sanity or health or lamp oil to manage. Few enemies and they mostly appear at pre-scripted moments for chase sequences. You never have to make any risk/reward type decisions, and this makes the game feel very low-stakes.\n\n• Story and scenario are not sufficiently realized. I think they needed a bigger budget and more time for this. Won’t go into details but suffice to say it’s a grandiose premise which could have been the basis for something great, but this is not how it panned out.","July 8, 2015","false","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It only got me twice, and one time was from a glitch. The problem is that everything is expected, especially since there only one type of monster that only patrols and chases you when it sees you, a very redundant concept by this point. It basically shows the problem with the current state of horror games: the lack of consideration of the player's psychology.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this to anyone who wants to play it for the horror aspect.\n","September 22, 2014","false","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sadly, my expectations were lowered in my time with it. Put in the simplest of terms, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is disappointing as an Amnesia game. As a story-focused adventure and modern horror game, it's recommended. It's a good effort from Dear Esther developer The Chinese Room, and the atmosphere is still much better than many modern horror games. It can still creep out and possibily scary you. But as a sequel to Amnesia: The Dark Descent, an absolutely terrifying delight of a horror game, it comes up short in multiple ways. Many game elements were removed, including the inventory screen and Lovecraftian-inspired sanity meter. The inventory screen leads to overly clunky puzzles, while the sanity meter is a sadly missed feature that removes the balancing act between light and shadow. The game is also made somewhat easier by the lantern having an unlimited power supply and the complete removal of tinderboxes. Finally, while the story is nicely written, it seems to follow the same pattern of the story in Amnesia: The Dark Descent. This essentially boils down to the phrase "not an Amnesia game". While cliched, it is sadly true. It just doesn't feel like the original or like a game from Frictional Games. It's clearly a sort-of successor to Dear Esther, and it does work on that level. So, if you're looking for the horror equivalent of Gone Home or Dear Esther, then Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs will satisfy. But otherwise, you're better off with the first one.","April 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is where they go wrong- Amnesia a Machine for Pigs is its own, original title.  While it relates back to the original, do not go into this game expecting it to -be- the original.  If you do, you will be disappointed.  If you do not, you will enjoy the experience profusely.\n\nWhile the game itself is not inherently horrifying, I thoroughly suggest this title to any gamer with a passion for story, atmosphere, and philosophy.  The narration was immaculate, and the ending phenomenal.  When you enter this game, expect not a mere horror game, simply for the sake of a scare, rather, an introspective plot characterized by a dismal, Victorian setting and atmosphere.  I must say, as a gamer with an interest for philosophy and atmosphere, I ended up enjoying this game even more than the original, and I grew to appreciate the characters moreso than the original.  However, only play this game if you are willing to sacrifice the scare factor for other qualities.  It may not be particularly scary, but this game has rightfully earned its place as my favorite survival-horror title.","December 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I myself, have a fear of man-made interiors, small-spaces, and darkness.  That comprises a good 2/3 of the environments in this game.  It felt very much to me like I was inside one of my own nightmares.  I loved the exterior/house sections too for world building purposes, but I was actually excited when the game switches to "descent mode".\n\nThe antagonist in this game is easily one of the BEST antagonists in any video game I have ever played.  This guy makes one of the most twisted horrendous plans that no one sane should able to even conceptualize... and actually partially accomlishes it.  All for the classic betterment of humanity.  I love the antagonist of this game.  10/10.\n\nThe sound is tear-jerking.  This includes bgm, voice acting, and random noises.  There's also a great deal of variation in bgm, from full out opera, classical, eerie ambiance, and then even ragtime loaded with political satire during the credits.\nThe voices and scripting are beautiful too.  This game is very poetic, like reading a good Edgar Allan Poe Poem.  Feels very quotable.  I also personally love how the main character refers to his family as "darling."  And like any good horror game, random noises attempt to keep you on edge always, though once you know you're probably not in danger you can numb yourself to the scratches, whispers, and footsteps.\n\nStory.  This is one point that even some of the worst critics of this game usually give.  What makes this story so good is that it is relatable.  It poses a "what if" scenario, that is terrifying because it can be conceptualized in reality to a certain extent.  Not to mention it plays on a primal fear of losing control, and highlights the tragedy of some of the darkest ages of actual historical past.\n\nI must mention the negatives, because indeed there are a few, which some people would consider these "game-destroying".  This game is somewhere in-between an interactive movie and an actual game.  You can indeed die if you're not attentive, are free to move around a limited environment, and there are a few pretty simple puzzles.  However there is no inventory, which means no typical Penumbra/Amnesia puzzles, worrying about your lantern oil, healing with laudanum (probably why it's hard to die).  There aren't many "jump-scares" or adrenaline pumping danger danger horror.  This game focuses on a deeper type of horror more akin to analyzing a deeply psychological nightmare than primal adrenaline reactionary horror.  Fine in my opinion to have those, but if you're looking for a danger around ever corner monster monster freak out session... don't expect to find it.  More saddening to me then anything else is the lack of the screeching noise whenever a monster is nearby... though the flickering light works pretty well too.\n\nTo me, this game is art.  The setting is beautiful and surreal, the sound is moving, and the story makes it hard for me to immerse myself in other shallower horror stories now.  If you consider the purchase of this game, make sure you're looking for an experience and not a jump-scare.\n","December 10, 2015","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
