"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/415960/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","This game reminded me of what was probably my first handheld video game… Merlin in 1978, and brings back a lot of happy memories. Yeah, video games have come a long way, but only recently have we begun to see a variety of fresh new expansions beyond the traditional shooter and racing genres. Sometimes You is already becoming well known for bringing out games with a novel approach to gaming, such as Retention and Energy Balance. Where those focused on photography and Math, Energy Cycle focuses on the Math of patterns and arrays… color synchronization.\n\nEnergy Cycle consists of patterns of lights that when pressed, toggle on or off adjacent lights. It’s a definite mind-bender, and the ambient electronic themes add to the “mind music” effect. When I first saw the trailer it reminded me of my old Merlin. But, where Merlin only had a limited field of about 9 lights to work with, Energy Cycle expands on the idea by presenting a variety of arrays and multiple colors. Each puzzle becomes increasingly complex, forcing you to use a part of your brain that doesn’t really get a lot of gaming time. Forgive me for lapsing into the old “right-brain/left-brain” ideas, but yeah it’s difficult to analyze a visual pattern that uses no words (like with the 1st game Retention.) If you love puzzle and thinking games, then you will definitely want to give this a try.\n\nThe Deluxe Collector’s Edition includes wallpapers, a "process" art book and a photo album of art that features nostalgic moments... especially of cats. It also includes the soundtrack with a mix of high energy, at times melancholic techno-funk sound effects. These were interesting to me because I enjoy getting some background on what goes into a game. It adds something a little extra to see how the creative process took off. And, that’s what makes Steam a great platform for gamers, because no matter how many gaming magazines you read, you can’t get all that in a magazine.\n\nThere is a level editor as well, where you can make your own patterns, and you are given a level code. But, I haven’t gotten far enough yet to figure out whether or how you share that code with friends to play each other’s designs. I will explore that more when I solve level 10, which I got stuck on.\n\nI grabbed a couple of extra copies, which I will be giving away over on Steam Gifts just as soon as they add the game to their giveaways list. The giveaways will show up on this link, probably in the next day or so... http://www.steamgifts.com/user/EdenStarGazer","January 13","true","17.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/recommended/415960/","celtic7guardian","Celtic7Guardian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celtic7guardian/","1158 products in account","Get caught in the cycle; you'll never want to leave!\nI recently crafted a badge that gave me a coupon for 50% off Energy Cycle. I checked to find that the game cost $0.99 at base price, so for the first time in my life, I used a Steam coupon to get a game. It proved to be a great choice. I enjoy puzzle games, and Energy Cycle is definitely one that is worth playing. What would be a good experience from the gameplay alone is boosted by the presentation and options Energy Cycle has, making it a jewel among a sea of puzzle games.\n\nPros:\nThe graphics are very appealing. The nodes are light blue, dark blue, and green, all of which are distinct and easy on the eyes against the dark background. The transitions have other colors that are highly stylish.\nThe music is fantastic. Rather than looping immediately when a track is finished, it moves into a new one, and will eventually cycle through several tracks of high quality. You can also mute the music inside the game, which is a nice option for players who want a quiet puzzle session.\nThe gameplay is simple yet challenging. All the player needs is a mouse to move and click with. The concept is easy to understand, as all you have to do is change every node color to be the same. But when higher levels are reached, this becomes far more difficult, as every click will alter various nodes and twist the player's mind.\nThere are 28 different puzzles that are premade. Some are quick, but most of them take a lot of thinking to overcome. Randomly clicking around the level is unlikely to help much. Having to put your brain cells to good use is a requirement for great puzzle games, and Energy Cycle succeeds in this.\nTime trial is a mode that has you see how many puzzles you can solve before the clock runs out. The puzzles are randomized, which makes it fun to replay.\nInfinite mode brings randomized puzzles to the table, but without a timer or any sort of limit present. If the player does not want to deal with the potential stress of running out of time, this is a great option.\nAchievements are present. Some of them are simple to get, while others require beating some tough levels and getting pretty far in time trial. I enjoy that combination of difficulities.\nThe price is absolutely reasonable. I have played three hours and probably have at least three more to go, if not more. That is a lot of fun gameplay for a base price of $0.99.\nThe game mascots are electric kitties. ADORABLE electric kitties. Instant win.\nNeutral:\nThere is a level creator, and it is easy to make your own levels with it. However, when you save the level, it goes somewhere that is unable to be accessed. I tried finding the levels I made, but they appeared to be gone, despite being "saved to the clipboard." Perhaps they are added to the random levels in time trial and infinite mode, but I cannot say for certain.\nSince the music has its own method of looping, it is impossible to pick which tracks you want to listen to. This might annoy some people. I like all the music, so it does not bother me.\nIn time trial and infinite mode, sometimes a puzzle will be created that immediately vanishes. I believe this is because it randomized into having all of the nodes as one color, meaning the puzzle is solved before you even get to see it. This skips the player to the next puzzle and counts it as having solved the one beforehand. On one hand, you solve a puzzle for free. On the other, you miss out on a puzzle that might have been enjoyable to solve.\nTrading cards do exist. They consist of the cute electric kitties and are nice to look at.\nCons:\nCertain levels can get very frustrating. This difficulty might be enjoyed by some players, but it can be a turn-off for others. It also depends on how good the player is at these types of puzzles. Energy Cycle's gameplay is centered around one type of puzzle, so if a player struggles with that type of puzzle, it may not be fun for them.\nTime trial has a loading sequence between puzzles that is pretty to look at. However, the clock does not stop during those sequences. While you do get a boost in how much time you have each time you solve a puzzle, that loading sequence drains a lot of it away.\nSince there is only one type of puzzle, if you do not enjoy it, you will not enjoy the game at all. I like these puzzles, but I can understand why other players would not.\nOverall experience:\n\nThe types of puzzles Energy Cycle has are not easy for me. There were times I would turn off the game and go huff in a corner about how mean it was being to me. Then I would come back and play it again because it was too fun to stay mad at for long. I actually went ahead and bought the developer's other game in the "series," Energy Balance, after seeing what Energy Cycle was like. That right there speaks of the quality Energy Cycle has, and how much I enjoy it.\n\nRating:\n\n8.5/10. Energy Cycle does a fantastic job at what it sets out to be. If you want a fun puzzle game with great music, visuals, and mind-twisters, it is very likely that Energy Cycle will be right up your alley.\n\nLooking for more great indie games?

But in a joyous way. To understand why this is, understand that it's a cheap, well designed logic puzzle, with an aesthetic that I can safely say is fairly unique, that it supports colourblind folks very well (Often a problem in the games industry), and so, in a sense, there is nothing to talk about. Because it *works*, and it's cohesively designed.\n\nHow, pray tell, are you going to write between 500 and 1000 words about that, eh?\n\nIt works.\nIt's got a neat aesthetic that I think should be experienced at least once.\nIt costs less than a takeaway, and lasts you longer.\nIt has digital cats.\n\nWhat the hell else do you want? Oh, cons? Yeah, one, and I expect it'll be obsolete before too long: The menu button in the top right isn't quite as visible as it could be. That's, er... It. If you somehow get tired of the 20 to 30 main puzzles, the time attack mode, or infinite play, there's a level editor for creating more puzzles to bake folks' brains with.\n\nNonetheless, I look forward to the challenge of pontificating about cats or colourblindness so the article isn't "Yeah, it works, is cheap, and looks kinda cool. Go check it out, it's not like you're going to miss that packet of crisps." ;)","January 16","true","1.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

It's a puzzle game where you on every level try to get all the "cells" to turn dark blue. When you press on a cell, every cell vertical/horizontal of that cell change in color as well. It's a decent game, with little variety. Even though you can make your own levels I just don't see the fun in doing the same in the long run. By no means is it a bad game, it's excactly as advertised. Just not much more. But with that price I still recommend it to people who find the concept intriguing. 5.6/10","March 12","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
