The turnoff on this game for me is that there is only one dictionary, and so it's hard to actually guess what word the game is asking you to spell. However, if you're very wordy, you won't find any difficulty jumping right into this game (you don't actually have to follow the game's reccomendations, you just can't accidentally gather a letter that isn't going to spell a word). I do love that it works with any MP3 file, and the in-game songs aren't bad as well.","March 7","true","0.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","20","21","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/420160/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Alphabeats is a combined word and rhythm game that was originally released as free game with pay-to-play levels on mobile platforms but was well reworked for PC, there is practically no trace of being a mobile game in the past.\n\nYou control a pointer that can horizontally move and collect letters from the board to form a word; those letters appear concurrently with the song rhythm. You have to make the best words you can, leading you to aim for the highest score (leaderboards are synchronised online). That might sound pretty easy but beware, as the song's speed gets higher and as you aim for longer words, you'll also have to keep in mind that you have to dodge the letters you don't want to use in a word which you plan to put together.\n\nThere are twenty levels (songs), all in electronic music genre. I'm not a music expert, but my wild genre guess would say to expect something between trance and dubstep. But even if you hate those music genres, you can still play your own songs! Though I feel this great function shares the same problem with all other rhythm games - the software can't recognize the beats from custom songs perfectly.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels, two aimed at casual players with low difficulty, and the third, spellfire difficulty, is aimed towards those who seek true word and rhythm challenge, as you'll have limited amount of lives, so you can't afford to do many mistakes.\n\nWhile you'll be putting words together, there are three abilites that can help you once for each level. You can double up the points for the word you make next time (great for those who want to get as big as they can), you can destroy all the letters on the board and you can reduce the size of your word to one letter (that may sound like a nonsense but there's a column for every letter otherwise, so as you have bigger word, you also take more space from the board).\n\nConclusion:Alphabeats has a nice and original idea for casual genre mashup, good vocabulary and nice soundtrack. The game design is thought out pretty well and there isn't any element that would feel amateurish. The first Rad Dragon's Steam game is worth recommending.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 9","true","1.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Do you have good reflexes? Are you good at spelling? Well, you had better have these qualities in abundance, because you are up for a challenge!\n\nAlphabeats: Master Edition is a combination of a spelling / rhythm (music) game.  As you launch the game, you will be presented with a comprehensive menu. In the middle of the screen you will be able to select from over 20 tracks to play – or you can upload your own favourite tracks. Also, you will have an option at the top “How to Play” (which is a good tutorial), an online leader board and the words you manage to spell correctly (the longest too).\n\nAt first you have to choose a song; it will be a good idea to begin with a slow tune to really get the feel of the game. On the screen you will see 12 vertical lines and the letters will descend from there. At the bottom of these lines, you will control a pointer. The pointer can only move horizontally in order to catch the letter and spell a word, but also to avoid the letters you don’t want. Let me tell you, it will get tricky when you reach a five or six-letter word, even on a slow tune.  The length of the songs can vary from two to four minutes and you have to score the maximum number of points within that time.  There are three power ups available per song: Double the points – If you managed to spell a rare or a long word click on this power up to double the points (I used this on the word “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥” and scored 4000 points, not bad for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) – Shrink – this one will shrink your current longest word on your pointer, so you can try to make a longer one – Bomb – when you activate the bomb all letters on the vertical lines will disappear. Remember, you can only use one of each per song. Now that you a master of Alphabeat, get a song with a little bit more rhythm. . .  Could I suggest Techno?! The faster the rhythm, the faster the letter will descend, and it will be a challenge to spell a long word. Hold on, all of that on the normal difficulty! You could give it a go on the tricky or spellfire difficulties. In the spellfire difficulty, you make three mistakes and its game over!\n\nYou can use either the keyboard or a gamepad for controls but I would recommend the gamepad as I find it easier myself. Great soundtrack with a good varieties of tunes.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great soundtrack\n-	Ability to load your own tunes\n-	Three level of difficulties\n-	Fun gameplay & re-playability\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Can be frustrating on the higher difficulty\n-	No trading cards\n\nAlphabeats: Master Edition combines is a really fun game to play and it will give you plenty of re-playability, especially with the option of loading your own track into the game.\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I have never experienced either crash, and the controls are very intuitve.\n\nAlphabeats is a great game to play when you have some time to kill. You can use your own music to play the game, and it also helps you figure out just how good your own vocabulary is. You can even have contests to see who has faster reflexes and thinking.\n\n10/10 would recommend.","March 7","true","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Especially for me as someone who doesn't speak english as a native language.\n\nI can see this game becoming popular and maybe even really competitive if it just got the right kind of advertisement through Youtube, etc...\n\nBut instead of playing it competitively you can also just play it when scrabble is either too standard, you find no partner or you are sick of waiting for your online opponent to play back.\n\nThe only thing is that even with my small vocabulary I already found that some words are not available, apart from the standard curse words. e.g: English as a word, didn't work...","March 9","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
