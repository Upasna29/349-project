The graphics are modern (ok it might not be top notch like in Dota2 but still it’s a great visuals to performance ratio).\nWe have many new features which introduces a little bit more complexity to the original gameplay in respect to the strategic and RPG element of it.\nThe new features include: campaign mode (actually 2 campaigns for light and 2 for dark), different layouts (boards), secondary abilities, different kind of magic squares, different difficulty levels and finally we have piece leveling up (up to third level).\n\nMy only complaint is about the multiplayer - it should really be implemented as some sort of LAN or steam server matchmaking and not a hotseat.\nAnyway it’s definitely worth the $10!\n\n8/10","March 27, 2014","true","3.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Why? Simple: I just don't know if I should love - or hate this game.\n\nIt's advertised as Archon classic, well that isn't exactly true, it is more than the classic game from the 80s of the last century, but it still has the classic gameplay with some not so obvious changes. It has become far more strategic than the original. Furthermore you have secondary attacks now, which also weren't present in the original. But the original idea, the eternal struggle between the light and the dark side are still the same, as were some of those obstacle glitches that could change the outcome of an battle in the original game.\n\nThe game can be loveable and frustrating at the same time, I know the game as an original, and yeah, even if it has a lot in common with chess, it is a fast paced battle-arena game. Sure it's two dimensional, but you don't need more for this kind of battle. This game offers even some more depth than the original by changing battlefields, secondary powers and... well campaigning... should I tell you more?\n\nOf course, the developer could have created an even better game by adding the contents of Archon 2 and Archon 3 (which was the worst of the series) and give access to such classics as the juggernaut or others by gaining victory points and so on. The idea of Archon is timeless, but I fear that this game might not be counted to the best games that were ported to our "next generation machines". Furthermore, the price of the game is ok, it isn't the best value offer, but it is still a lot better as most sims or visual novells which go for the same price. Once in a while I just love a quick and frustrating game of Archon, even though this game is now 30 years old.","December 8, 2014","true","1.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It has everything the old game did, and offers a lot of improvements. The major thing being secondary attacks. Those were first introduced in Archon Ultra, and these are somewhat similar. There is also the ability to play on different maps some are dependant upon the number of players. ( You can have 4! :D) There is the classic Archon map, maps that allow your guys to level up to level 3, and maps that have runes that provide benefits when you move onto them.\nFor those of you who feel the base game was fine the way it was however, and don't want all these additions. You are in luck as you have the ability to turn off the secondary abilities so it will play like the base game. In fact they even brought in the old school original Archon graphics for units, as well as updated graphics. The only drawback is the multiplayer is same computer only. No network/internet.

The units are smart, balanced, leading to fantastically tense gameplay on occasions. However, the games style, taking a board game and a real time arena fight make it unconventional as board game style videogames go, and I would really say it appeals more to the side of me that likes turn based RPGs and old arcade and micros games. Its a worthwhile buy in any case if you want to spend a few minutes thinking and slaying in equal measures.","July 15, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I honestly wish there was a modern version of this game as it has not aged well. Do not bother playing the campaign, it's a snooze fest. This game is fun as ♥♥♥♥ when you have three other people all duking out on the same board. There's not nearly as much strategy as a game like chess, but it's still a game based off skill. Like chess, there are "black" and "white" pieces (dark and light), but instead of having the exact same roles and moves, they play a little differently. This is pretty cool as there's different ways to play the two sides, but the downside is that there are some pieces that are inherently better than others though they're of the same rank (Pheonix is completely useless for example, while genie is easily the most powerful enemy in the entire game if you upgrade him).\n\nThe board's luminosity (basically the light/darkness of a tile on a board) fluctuates as time moves on, so if you're a white piece, you get an advantage in combat if you fight on a tile that is lighter. This makes it just a little more tactical than just running up to your opponent and bashing them in with a genie. That being said it's still a mindless game unless you plan on going for the cunning plan of winning the game by board domination rather than complete annhiliation.\n\nAlso you can cast SPELLS!

This remake re-creates the original perfectly, while adding a lot of new content and game modes. There are three big problems though:\n\n1) the original Archon is 31 years old (as of 2014). While the core mechanics have aged very well we have to admit that much water has passed under the bridge since. There are thousands of better games, more deep, more strategic, more multiplayer, more everything that appeared on the market in the last 30 years. So if you want to play it to feed your nostalgia or to experience a game of the past, fine. But compared with many recent titles this isn't obviously the best game that your money can buy, not by a long shot.\n\n2) The most fun part of Archon was to play with your friends that were in the same room. That was the way of playing multiplayer games back then. Playing solo or online detract immensely from the experience rendering the game almost "useless"\n\n3) The graphics are bad. There's no art direction, the characters are soulless pre-rendered sprites of the worst type , completely out of context and with ugly animations. Textures, colors, backgrounds, fonts are put together with no taste at all. It looks very amateurish (even if the game as a whole it's not) and this is a pity since a remake with outstanding artistic qualities could have been a great game. A game that could have made us completely forget the two points above.\n\nIn its current form the game is just "decent". I would not recommend it at full price, but if you are an old school gamer try to buy it on sale, mostly for collection purpose.\n\nDespite all the above I don't feel like giving Archon a bad review, just remember to get it at low price.","October 14, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lightning fast reflexes and great timing are probably most important, as long as you pick the terms of a fight.\n\nTry to fight on dark squares if you are the dark side, and light squares if you are the light side, for a big advantage.
