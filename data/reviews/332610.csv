If you have a problem with either of these genres, you might not enjoy the game but I love both so this is great for me.\n\nFor the P&C half you will be rubbing together items and trying to use them on characters/objects until you find a combination that works. This is pretty much a staple of the genre so I always find it odd when people complain about this mechanic. Most of the puzzles I've come across so far are pretty straight-forward, though. You should be able to guess what will work and what won't. The game does let you pick up useless items but I also found a dumpster that lets you throw out said useless items so if you've got stuff filling up your inventory, take a trip to the dumpster and if the game lets you throw it out, you won't need it. A pretty decent system, if you ask me.\n\nThe Metroidvania half is pretty much what you would expect: RPG leveling, places/items you can see but can't get to yet, backtracking, etc. You have a fireball attack (rapid fire is present so feel free to spam the attack button), a melee attack (automatically gets used when you try to shoot a fireball when you're too close to an enemy) and jumping to start off with but with upgrades as you progress.\n\nOverall, it's a great game so far with few complaints and those complaints are very minor:\n1 - The default gamepad controls were awkward and while you can remap the keyboard keys you can't remap the gamepad buttons so expect to open your gamepad software and make a profile for this game if you want to use your gamepad. (EDIT: Has been fixed in a patch.)\n2 - The game uses the same button to open/use inventory as it does talking to people or inspecting objects so when you're trying to rub items on things you have to stand on the person/object to talk to/inspect them and then take a step to the side to try to use items on them. It's slightly awkward but not anything that breaks gameplay. You get used to it. (EDIT: Has been fixed in a patch.)\n3 - Sometimes when I try to use items it will exit out of the item menu without trying to use it. Weird. Make sure to pay attention for the SFX for an item being used. If there's no SFX it canceled so you'll have to try again. (EDIT: This only happened for a few hours of my first run and then the controls started working fine after that. Not sure what the issue was.)\n4 - I have come across a couple very minor bugs. I have a thread on the forums describing them. Nothing game-breaking. The dev is also on top of fixing them.\n\nAs I said though, those are all fairly minor issues. The game runs well, looks good, the characters and aesthetic are charming and it has a decent length, taking me about 8-9 hours to beat it the first time and about 15 hours to 100% complete it. If you like Metroidvanias and Point & Click Adventures then you should check this game out.","May 22, 2015","true","13.0"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","34","40","0","0"

You definitely should buy it, if you are into cute metroidvania-esque games with some quest elements.\n\nYou can call this game “cutelvania”: it’s cute and it’s metroidvania. You will explore a big magic school with paths blocked here and there, fight nicely designed but, sometimes, generic bosses and progress toward the end. The “True end” can feel a bit of anticlimactic, but I think that in it lies a twist and a lesson about how humanity evolved and became much stronger than SPOILERS.\n\nGameplay: it is your metroidvania: you explore the school; you find bosses; you defeat bosses; you gain abilities to progress through previously blocked paths. Some path requires you to solve puzzles just like old point and click adventures: here, have a bunch of items, now try to think how to combine them. Sadly, Belle’s inventory is limited, so you need to think what you will carry around and what will you leave near the portal. Jumping and moving are kinda slow and “floaty” which leads to frustration at some sections (mostly, with bosses). Hitboxes are big, unfair and make me sad.\n\nStory: it’s cute and nice. No betrayals, no backstabbing, no evil plans — find ingredients for potions and enjoy colorful levels and enemies. I would surely play this game with my daughter (if I had one)\n\nCharacters: My teacher loves to unwind at nightclubs. Which is lovely.\n\n\nP.S.

It manages to beautifully mash-up elements of Metroidvanian exploration and progression with logic based item puzzles typical of point and click adventure games. Throw in a handful of colourful characters, challenging boss fights and more raw oozing charm than you can shake a broomstick at, and the result is a fresh experience that remains enjoyable and satisfying all the way through.\n\nIn this game, you play as the Eponymous Belle McFae, a smart alecky, foul-mouthed witch in training who has just been framed for the destruction of the annual Walpurgisnact brew. After a thorough chewing out by her teachers, she is instructed to find three rare ingredients to make a new brew before sunrise. The initial story on offer in Mystik Belle is serviceable, and becomes more intricate as you progress, but what really fleshes out the world and makes you invested in the game, are the characters that Belle will encounter on her mission. The writing manages at all times to be entertaining  and full of charm – each character has their own unique personality and Belle’s interactions with them are definitely a high-point of the game. The attention to detail shown by the developer is fantastic, with many characters having unique dialogue lines and interactions for each item presented to them. Be it a hint on how to use it, or just a really meta nod to the player, these conversations between Belle and her friends were a real treat and while they added very little to the actual gameplay, still had me going back with each new item I found.\n\nAs stated, the gameplay is divided between platforming/combat and item puzzles. These puzzles should be familiar to anyone who has ever played a point and click adventure game – they consist of finding an item, and figuring out where to use it, or what other item to combine it with. Generally I found it enjoyable trying out different item combinations, as even when using the wrong item, Belle chimes in with a witty one-liner. The main problem I felt that this area of the gameplay suffered from was the inventory limit. Belle can only hold so many items before having to drop one, and towards the start of the game you are just collecting items with no idea what to do with them, additionally, the map only indicates where an item has been left, not what it is. This results in a lot of unnecessary backtracking and head scratching trying to remember where you left a specific item. I appreciate that metroidvanias often involve a lot of backtracking but this felt a little forced as though it was included simply to create the need to backtrack. Overall though, I felt that the adventure aspects on offer were solid, and were a lot of fun to experiment with.\n\nAs for combat, Belle begins simply with the ability to jump and shoot fireballs, but, in true Metroidvanian fashion, as you progress and level up, your arsenal of magical powers will expand to enhance both your combat abilities and means of traversal. The controls in Mystik Belle are certainly not as tight as I would have liked, resulting in a lot of cheap hits from foes. This is compounded by the sheer amount of enemy fire on screen, and the erratic patterns of flying enemies. Often I would lose a large chunk of health on the way to a boss and be forced to farm hearts for a few minutes. Thankfully, when enemies enter melee range, you can smack them with your broom, killing most small foes outright. I would have liked this melee attack to have greater application, such as deflecting enemy fire, this would have made combatting bosses much more enjoyable and enhance the combat system by forcing you to decide when to attack and when to defend. For better or worse, the combat remains very simplistic, with the unlockable charge shot being the weapon of choice for most encounters. Levelling up does improve your standard fireball attack considerably, but some involvement in the level up system would have been appreciated, as opposed to an automatic process.\n\nNot too far into the story, Belle unlocks the dash ability, and this is easily the most painful part of the game. Dashing is performed by double tapping left or right and frequently activates by accident or more commonly, not at all. There is absolutely no need for dash to be assigned to the directional buttons. The triggers and bumpers on the gamepad aren’t even used for anything, and could have easily accommodated the dash ability. This seems like a strange oversight, and hopefully it can be patched by the developer, because not only is the dash unresponsive, it doesn’t feel as satisfying to perform as it should. This makes both getting around, and evading bosses harder and less enjoyable than they otherwise would be.\n\nDespite one or two mechanical hiccups, Mystik Belle is still an exceptional game, and if there are two  areas where it really shines, it’s in its sound, and graphical design. Mystik Belle is straight up gorgeous and looks as though it was designed for the Sega Megadrive (or Genesis for you yanks), and this is by no means a criticism. The pixel art and animations within Mytik Belle are truly impressive and reminded me of the Shantae series throughout. It also proudly boasts some of the nicest shadow effects I’ve ever seen in a 16-bit game, which combined with the often spooky atmosphere of Hagmore Academy result in a visually stunning, well realised game world.  The soundtrack by Dan Rogers is another real treat. From the mysterious opening theme alone I could tell that this was going to be a good game. The frenetic, eerie chiptune tracks perfectly reflect the environs of the academy, and each is a joy to listen to. The tracks are diverse enough to not sound monotonous between areas, while retaining the same style throughout.\n\nI greatly enjoyed the time I spent playing Mystik Belle, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a good, old-school platformer game. For the work of a single man, Mystik Belle is a truly exceptional achievement, and I can’t wait to see what Andrew Bado, and LastDimension bring us next. The combat mechanics are a little rough around the edges, but the sense of exploration, progression and experimentation are as enjoyable and rewarding as many top shelf metroidvanias. If you want a game that’s oozing with style and charm from start to finish, look no further than Mystik Belle.\n\nPros:\n+Gorgeous Pixel Graphics\n+Stellar Soundtrack\n+Terrific writing\n+Solid adventure aspects\n\nCons:\n-Combat is a little rough\n-Dash mechanic\n\nScore:8.5/10\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 23, 2015","true","7.6"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","24","27","6","0"

That being said, many of the issues that I had with my first hour of play, did not get better, and in some cases did in fact get worse.  I will touch base on those later.  What I want to address first, is why I believe the game is worth investing in.\n\nThis is actually a well planned out hybrid of point and click collection/puzzle solving, and action platforming.  Like the genre it pulls gameplay from, you can expect to need to observe your surroundings, and visual ques that the game does in fact deliver, and read what the NPCs have to say, not only about events, but the items you have available in your inventory.  As you collect new abilities you are granted more access to the school.  As you progress through the school, you gather more items to use and combine to solve the various puzzles that are presented to you.  These puzzles are not overly complicated.\n\nThe sprite work in the game is spectacular.  The sprites are large and detailed.  The levels are also masterfully detailed too.  The soundtrack to the game is also pretty fun too.  All of these features make for a great base for a game.  And if you can look past some of the current flaws that the game has, you will get a pretty enjoyable, and fun title that can occupy a good three hours for your first playthrough.\n\nThe following information will be a few issues I currently have with the game, and suggestions to fix the problems:\n\n1) The backtracking.  While this issue does not necessarily bother me overall, I can definitely see where this games flavor of it can and may drive some players off.  As it stands, the game only allows you to carry five items in your inventory at one time.  The chore of the matter comes from the large variety of items that you can encounter at any time.  Several periods of time in the game will have you working with six to ten items, some of which may, or may not be useful.  The way the game is designed, you have to do alot of switching to figure out which ones are which.\n\nIn classic metroidvania fashion, you go one direciton toward a boss.  Enroute to that boss, you may find some areas you cannot access.  Defeat the boss then move to a different area of the school.  Along the way find yet another area you simply cannot access.  Gather abilities, rince repeat, gain access to more areas of teh school.  This should be the only real reason you should have to backtrack and even successful metroidvania games get slammed some times for the rediculous amount of backtracking involved.  This game does the player no favors by limiting the item inventory to five.\n\nI personally believe this game does not need the limitation.  The way the game runs at the time of this review, the limited inventory only serves to pad the length of the game in an annoying fashion as opposed to a constructive one.  Personally, I don't mind the item management to much.  I do however understand that other players may, and I will acknowledge that this feature of the game does in fact slow progress down.  Considering the other half of the game is action platforming, the last thing you want to do in the game is provide reasons to drag down progress.\n\n2) The action platforming elements.  I found that the game has an issue registering double taps of any action that is NOT your attack button.  I found that attack, responded 100% to every button press, where double tapping a direction to dash, or double jumping did not reliably work all the time.  When portions of the game literally rely on accurate dashes and double jumps to gain ground and progress, it really hurts playability when these two actions do not work 100% of the time.  I honestly don't know if this is a simple programming issue, or if there is something else wrong like unclear rule definitions (IE the limitations, and requirements to pull off the actual abilities.  Timing and delay rules).  There were countless incidents during my live Twitch streams where the Dash ability was not working, and the Double Jump ability did not respond when it should have.\n\nI STRONGLY recommend adding an extra button that can be applied to the dash special ability.  Performing the dash ability is single handedly the worst aspect of this game, and a total gameplay destroyer in my opinion.  I found that the seemingly random activation of the dash ability was by far more annoying and infuriating than anything and everything else that the game has to offer.  By applying the dash button to one key/button, it will help to constructively accomodate what is currently a broken dash system, by limiting the amount of times an accidental dash occurs.  There were times when I hit left then right and ended up dashing.  This issue sends me off ledges, or into shots and enemies that I would not have otherwise experienced.  Like dashing in a chose direction, these accidental dashes seem to happen randomly, and only when I was franticly dodging enemies and their bullets.\n\nI am not saying to remove the double tap all together.  It would be more constructive to just simply add an option to turn double tapping on or off, and enable an actual dash button.  In the end, I seriously found the dash to be one of the most detrimental elements that this game had on my enjoyment.  Of all of the issues, (even the game breaking ones), this NEEDS to be fixed.\n\n3) There were numerous occasions where I was unable to actually finish the game.  Once, I had the science ninja fight end, and the science ninja ended up dropping the copper wire on the ceiling, preventing me from collecting an item nessesary for completion.\n\nI also had an incident that happened twice (one with a happy ending).  I finished a boss fight, and died due to the left over bullets  during the bosses death throws.  Before I was even able to learn the ability from the boss, I was teleported back to the council chamber, and denied the actual ability I was supposed to earn from the boss.  This, as expected, left me unable to complete the game (the boss in question was the evil tree boss BTW)  I had a similar incident occur during my live stream, but I did manage to get the ability.\n\nAll of these three issues taken into concideration, the game doesn't feel like it is an early access title (meaning it feels like a flawed full release that is waiting on patches to fix the launch issues.)  I had alot of fun with the game, but think I will wait on my speedrun attempts until the dash/double jump issues are fixed.  Given the price point, the game is worth a look.  And should the three issues I have with the game be addressed, I would say that it is definitely worth a purchase.","May 23, 2015","true","8.6"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

Rather than simply gating features with specific items in a linear or otherwise hackneyed fashion, this game involves using the right items in the right places to further one's explorations, and occasionally combining multiple items.\n\nOverall, the game is a pleasure to play.  (There's one mechanic whose controls are a little annoying at times but it's still workable.)  Bosses can be rather difficult, so it is important to know when to stay back and dodge and when (and how) to go all-in with one's attacks.  The music, a chiptune soundtrack by Dan "Myoosic" Rogers, is enjoyable, too -- a little bit on the bright side at times, but it fits the sense of childish playfulness that this story exudes.\n\nMost important and most impressive, however, are the script and the art.  The art is gorgeously detailed, and the developer's skill at creating beautiful sprite art really shines through -- sometimes literally, as even the lighting effects show an attention to detail.  The script, including numerous unique responses of characters to various items that you can show them, is similarly detailed and filled with great and often humorous characterization.\n\nI recommend keeping your excess items -- anything you don't yet know what to do with -- in a warp room.  You can just leave stuff there and it'll stay there, don't worry.  The mini-map even tells you where items are, indicated by dots in the rooms.  Characters who can help you identify the uses of items will be near warp rooms.  In general, just remember to be observant of what characters say, which contains lots of clues.\n\n(Disclosure: I acquired this game for backing the Kickstarter for the game Legend of Iya.)","May 31, 2015","true","12.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Mystik Belle is a gem of an Indie game, deserving far more attention then it has gotten. From the art style, to the Metroidvania elements, everything in the game works well and cohesively. Playing Mystik Belle feels like catching up with an old friend, it just fits and feels right. Exploring a huge castle that slowly expands as you gain more spells and abilities. The game is fun, challenging, and does little to no hand holding whatsoever. This aspect is of particular of importance to note, given the games Point & Click features. Several moments in the game require you to combine or bring a correct item to a certain point in the game. The themes and music of Mystik Belle, are full of charm, and you can easily tell were a labor of love. Now that isn't to say that Mystik Belle is a perfect game. There are plenty of times in the game where you can feel overwhelmed and downright lost. The inventory system requires you to plan ahead and sometimes backtrack to complete a particular quest. However, the good vastly out weighs the bad in this game, long as you play smart. With 8 bosses, plenty of spells, and plenty to explore and find, Mystik Belle is going to give you plenty of bang for your buck. Throw on top of that some steam achievements, cards, controller support, and you've got a great game that deserves your attention.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/_lK6rcs4R8I\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","June 17, 2015","true","7.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Many items have amusing effects when used in different locations, so even being stuck can be fun in its own right. Leveling up takes the sting out of backtracking or wandering around while stuck, rewarding you with increased health and the occasional attack upgrade for your effort.\n\nSimply put, Mystik Belle is a fun and well designed game that's easy to recommend to metroidvania and adventure fans alike (and especially to fans of both).

The map design is simple but effective, the sprite artwork is beautiful and impressive, the dialogue is quirky, and it feels satisfying to play.\n\nOne element of the game that I particularly appreciated is that the adventure-esque puzzles are generally neither too obvious nor too cryptic.  At times, I got a little puzzled deciding where I needed to go next, but I never needed to resort to a walkthrough.  Everything makes sense.\n\nI feel as if it could have used just a bit more refinement in certain areas, though.  My biggest qualm with the game might've been Belle's lack of defensive tactics.  She's not nearly small or agile enough character to avoid the barrage of attacks coming from all directions in certain situations, meaning that taking lots of damage is sometimes (seemingly) entirely unavoidable and creates some frustrating difficulty spikes, especially during later boss fights. Any sort of magic shield or dodging capabilities would have been greatly appreciated.  It also doesn't help that enemies randomly generate from the sides of the screen and sometimes hit you the moment you enter a new room.  In short, it doesn't always feel justified when you get hit.\n\nA minor complaint that I have is that while the soundtrack is catchy and suits the mood quite well, I wish it had a bit more variety; it feels like one theme plays through the majority the game.  Item management is a hassle due to the very limited inventory space, leveling up feels like a chore until you max out, and I feel like it wouldn't have been difficult for both of those things to be set up more efficiently to keep the flow intact.\n\nIn the long run, these issues did no keep me from staying invested in the game for hours at a time until completion.  There are a lot of fun little details to it, and the whole concept is right up my alley.

Combining metroidvania and old-style adventure games isn't something I'd have thought of before I saw it here, but the overall effect is quite fun. I love the art style, although the huuuuuge beautiful detailed character sprites do make it a bit hard to dodge at times. Music was solid too. Puzzles are more or less logical, I was able to figure everything out on my own without too much trouble. Controls are somewhat clunky (can't double jump after you start to fall, easy to dash when you don't want to), but the game doesn't demand enough precision for that to ever become too frustrating. There was a surprising amount of different enemies and abilities for a "small" game, and the "true" ending is ... suitably epic. Overall I can recommend this to those that enjoy the underlying genres.","October 9, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I figured "meh, even if it's not horror it's still good for Halloween." Being on sale helped but honestly, I would've even bought this one at full price. I'm apparently very late to the party but that means I guess I missed most of the bugs and problems.\n\nMystik Belle reminds me of one of those cool-looking NeoGeo games that I'd see in magazines but knew I'd never be able to play. It's music and graphics throw back to the old days but not in the manufactured nouveau-retro way a lot of games do nowadays. The sprites and backgrounds were obviously made with attention and love. There's a lot of personality here. The areas and characters are full of tiny details which you see right from the start. Sprites are large and detailed, locations have several layers to them (the foreground layer of the lower-right area is so cool) and the customary torchlight zones are mixed with a modern effect where your fireballs also produce light. I kept shooting into the darkness to see if I could find secrets.\n\nThe story is pretty tame but still very enjoyable, with two endings (only the True ending gets a final boss, though it's more for LOLs and closure than for a suitable climax). It's easy to see both in a single playthrough. There are 8 hidden backstory notes to find (finding them all triggers the true ending) so I guess if you found them before seeing the normal ending then you might miss out? I dunno.\n\nThe dialogue is often amusing. Apparently I was playing the censored version the whole time and I didn't see an option to switch it to uncensored. If it is just a toggle that I'm missing then it would add more replay, playing again to see how dialogue changes and how the characters change because of what they say.\n\nBut apart from the main story the game has loads of bonus dialogue if you show items to NPCs. This is also often where hints can come from. There's also some subtle character stuff which some might not notice, like the identity of the masked antagonist (pay attention in the dorm and clues given when making a related item) and I always find little things like that can only be done with care and love, so including them shows a developer who worked hard on their project.\n\nThe game's fairly difficult, or maybe I'm just losing my touch with age. I was often jumping just between bullets, only to mess up a landing (memories of playing the Valis games, right there). What compounds the difficulty is that, at it's core, this is much more of an adventure game than just a metroidvania. It's not just "find item X to get to place B". You need to talk to NPCs, think about what items will need to be in your inventory if you need to combine stuff, and search the school high and low, many times over. And a lot of that happens before you have the first 3 warp rooms unlocked. So if you're not so familiar with the more-than-just-action style then you'll find yourself whittled down by enemies as you search the halls again and again.\n\nBosses can also get pretty rough but like most such games it's just a matter of learning what their patterns or triggers are and remembering your advanced moves might be needed to dodge some attacks.\n\nThis review is kind of stretching on so I'll end it here but I was actually very pleased with my purchase. There's a lot of love that went into Mystik Belle and I'd gladly follow more of her adventures if more get made.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FIGHTME/recommended/332610/","FIGHTME","I love the lag","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FIGHTME/","482 products in account","Mystik Belle is an indie Metroidvania/Adventure game hybrid with excellent pixel presentation.  Like most adventure games, the game is very short once you understand what to do.  Although the platforming and combat is fairly good, the controls are a little picky for the special moves, and moving around this way helps alleviate some of the boredom.\n\nUnfortunately a few of the puzzles miss the mark a bit or involve background setpieces, and having a few red herring items and finite inventory space will tire out the fun as you head through the same corridor the umpteenth time.  Giving items to characters or asking for advice on them is a bit of a pain, and if you've just used all your items up oftentimes no one has useful advice.  Another issue is that the resolution is a bit small considering how nice and big the sprites all are.  It looks good, but it's hard to see what's ahead and Belle can neither look beyond the screen, nor can she duck which may cause some annoying deaths until you're familiar with the territory.\n\nDespite these flaws, the dialogue, main character and setting are enjoyable enough and the game is tricky enough to keep you interested if you like the mechanics and futzing out solutions to things.  I definitely wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but there simply aren't any other games on steam quite like Mystik Belle, and if you can stomach a few nonsense puzzles most of what's here is worth it.","January 18","true","7.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It's not so hard, which is a good idea, because of the second aspect of the game:\n\nThe adventure aspect has much more depth than meets the eyes when you first see the game: you've got to explore, you've got to find objects, to combine them, and to use them here or there, so to make progress into the game. This takes a few tries and lots of exploration. This means that you'll be doing lots of backtracking (hence, it's fortunate the enemies are not too hard and don't block your path).\n\nThe dialogues are always fun and sometimes hilarious, if you take the time to talk to them. The characters are interesting, they are well fleshed-out and all have a personality, even the "supporting actors". (Typical Adventure Game Hint: talk to everybody, and show them the objets you gather to get their advice).\n\nIf you like the atmosphere, the graphics and the universe, you'll like to spend time in this game and this time will be rewarded by progressively expanding your area of exploration and your possibilities. I've now completed the game and got the two good endings. But I'll keep playing a bit and I'll keep editing this review as I discover new things.\n\nThe more you play the game, the more depth you find: additional spells let you do additional things and open more area (letting you find exponentially more objects for more things to do in more places...) Some powers/spells are obvious and you'll expect to get them, but a few others will surprise you. And thus, this game is much larger than meet the eyes on a first casual glance. I'm sure you'll be surprised when you'll discover some areas.","January 29","true","28.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/papertank/recommended/332610/","papertank","Mostly Safe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/papertank/","107 products in account","Easiest way I can put it is this is a very NES type game. The controls are very simple with really only using movement buttons, jump, shoot, and select.  I haven't beaten the game but the mechanics so far are simple as well. The level meter hasn't really been an issue to me as I still keep my current level and just lose progress to the next. If I'm at like 90% to get a level, I'll grind it out. Other than that, I don't even bother.\n\nThe puzzles are also very NES standard. You are set in the world, here's maybe 1 sentence to help you out for the next objective, go. This is back before the internet. You play a game and you have to use your head(or get Nintendo Power) to solve anything. You have to remember where important places are or if there's anything off just like in Metroid.\n\nThere is inventory management in this game however inventory management is like a non-issue. The second I found I could only carry a certain amount I just went to the portal area and dropped everything off. Then Death started appearing and I wondered what the hell? This didn't happen before so what changed? I killed some ghosts so maybe that was it. I went to a room without any ghosts and he was still there. Then I remembered I dropped my stuff off and immediatly went, "OH! (no spoilers)! That's actually really clever" and went back and grabbed it. Ever since then, I drop off everything except for that item whenever I go to a new area. If I need to go back, then I go back. It's not an issue at all.\n\nThere are flaws though. There are some very tight jumps that could have easily been fixed by either increasing the jump height or platform lengths or heights by a few pixels. There are a few cheap hits while moving to the next screen that while don't really bother me since I remember Medusa Heads and the damage is minimal, I can see it bothering others. The level system doesn't make you feel stronger. You do get a shot change after a few levels but the inbetweens don't make you feel much of anything. My biggest gripe is a dash move you get after a boss. I could just be me but the activation rate on it is terrible for me. If I'm on the ground, I get it off like 95% of the time so that's okay. I can call it player error. In the air however, maybe 30% activation if I did anything other than a neutral jump and 70% if I did a neutral jump. I tried doing regular double taps, consistent tapping, and button mashing. Mashing helped a bit but again, only neutral jumps had me doing it more than 30% of time. It feels like a game issue since I can dash on the ground while very little issue.\n\nOverall, It's a enjoyable game. It won't set the world on fire and I'll probably forget about it after a few months but I will enjoy my time with it and I can see myself seeing this game in my library and playing it again at some point. If you like old style Metroid games, you'll have a good time.","May 24, 2015","true","6.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The same high quality from the screenshots is maintained throughout the game. The different areas are sufficiently unique and each has its own atmosphere. The soundtrack complements the game nicely.\n\nThe action is well-paced with superbly designed monsters and rewarding boss fights. The controls definitely need some getting used to and feel a bit sluggish at first, but soon enough everything falls into place.\n\nBelle can level up, which increases hitpoints and firepower. When she dies, she is resurrected in the starting room with all items intact, but experience points reset to the beginning of the current level. So once the character levels up, that level remains fixed even after death.\n\nMystik Belle is sold as a Metroidvania with a point-and-click twist, the latter of which was a two edged sword for me. Belle has to find items which need to be used, either by themselves or combined with other items, to open new passages and advance the game. Since the developer wanted to reward the player for thinking about the items and paying attention to the conversations he decided to limit the inventory size, so you cannot keep all your stuff with you all the time. I kept all my belongings in one room so that I wouldn't have to go on a scavenger hunt as soon as I needed a specific item, but still I had to backtrack a lot. All in all these puzzles were not impossibly hard.\n\nMystik Belle was developed mainly by one person (except for the music), which I find an outstanding feat, and the game has an unbelievable level of polish for that. Metroidvania-purists may find the amount of skills to be learned somewhat limited though (one additional spell and two jump upgrades).\n\nI finished the game in about eight hours. Visually, Mystik Belle has a lot to offer. The gameplay content I would describe as bite-sized, which I did not find particularly problematic since there are just so many things to see and explore.\n\nThere are two endings, the good one of which can be achieved by finding eight scrolls hidden throughout the map. Getting these will reward the player with an additional boss fight which, although not terribly challenging, was still exceptionally well done and gave the game a nice sense of closure.\n\nI would definitely recommend the game.","July 25, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It features beautiful pixel art visuals and a nice soundtrack and charming characters. The game is somewhat short once you know what to do and though there are undertones of a fleshed out setting, the NPCs aren't featured enough to create much of an attachment.\n\nThe description doesn't lie, though it has plenty of exploration and upgrades like metroidvanias, the bulk of progress is acheived by finding the right items and taking them to the right people and places, which takes a lot of guesswork, trial and error, like classic point and click games. It is made harder by giving you a limited inventory size, which means juggling items until you have the right ones to take to the right place. A helpful tip for players: leave items you don't know how to use in easy to reach rooms, as to avoid backtracking.\n\nThe metroidvania side of the gameplay is par for the course. You have a shooting attack that upgrades as you kill enemies, and you get more skills, either for attack or movement, as you progress. One bothersome detail is that the jumps at first are just barely high enough to reach the platforms above, so it takes a lot of pixel-perfect jumps until you are given skills to navigate more comfortably.\n\nThe genre mix is a novelty that can be as amusing as it becomes bothersome, and it doesn't revolutionize anything, but overall it's a charming game that can give you some hours of fun.","January 20","true","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm glad there wasn't, as I had to figure it out for myself organically. Since getting past what I was stuck on, things have progressed pretty smoothly, and while it isn't always obvious what items can be used where, there is almost always another area to explore!\n\nOverall I'd give this game an 8/10!\n","June 30, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty fun after you get used to the controls (just remember to map the Action and Menu buttons to two different keys if you don't like the default setup), and while the dash is kinda picky sometimes as to whether or not it'll activate everything else felt good, in my opinion.\n\nGraphics are really excellent - pixel art that actually feels like something you'd see on the SNES or GBA but with some lighting effects to make them pop up. Music is also pretty catchy, especially in the later levels.\n\nCouldn't find any glaring bugs in my playthrough, possibly due to the developer being so fast with the bug fixes. In fact, he's pretty active in the discussion area, and based on current topics it's likely that the game will only get better with time. As-is, though, it's still pretty solid.\n\nOne thing to note: This is a game that requires you to manage your inventory, talk to people constantly for clues and solve puzzles to progress. Playing it like your usual metroidvania will lead to frustrations, so if these are things you don't like then this is not the game for you. Otherwise I highly recommend it - it's worth at least one playthrough, and there's a hint thread stickied on the discussions area if you're stuck anywhere.\n\nNOTE TO LINUX USERS: There are two bugs present that only appear in this version, both of which seem to be the fault of Gamemaker (the developer can't do much, though he's tried/trying). The first is a very easy to ignore one: If you take a screenshot with Steam it'll only save the upper-left corner of the screen; unfortunately, this means you can't share images, but at least it's nothing that influences gameplay. The second, however, is more serious: At the time of writing this, it will not detect any gamepad other than the wired Xbox 360 controller. Hopefully there will be a fix for this one, but until then if you don't have the wired 360 pad then you'll have to settle with keyboard controls.","June 19, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are often multiple puzzles and/or paths which are blocked but only one of them can be progressed and the player has to guess which one it is. If you make a wrong guess.. well tough luck you just wasted hours of time. If you try all of them and fail at every one of them it really feels like "game over".\n\nYou will often find yourself in a situation where you wonder "Am I even supposed to complete this puzzle at this point? Have I missed items or objectives? Do I have the required tools to complete the task?" It can really leave you in a situation where you have to give up and looks at the walkthrough.\n\nThe game world and it's story are really good. I have no complaints about graphics/animation/music either. Unlike in many games they have really poured a lot of effort to make different enemies. Almost every room has unique enemies.\n\nWhat I didn't like was that difficulty was more or less a joke. It's fairly easy to complete the game with less than ~30 total deaths. Most of the deaths I had were caused by an item which I willingly left behind. The world is actually also fairly small. It only feels large because puzzles require you to travel back and forth.\n\n\nWhat really breaks the game:\n\n-Inventory management hell:\nYou only have limited space in inventory and to make it worse there are a lot of items which are either junk or items which are needed only much later in the game. There is a way to automatically identify and discard junk items but it requires you to constantly travel to certain area with new items. The developers also decided to make an item which is required to be with you all the time unless you want death following you everywhere.\n\n-Some puzzles are really frustrating:\nThe most frustrating puzzles require you to do the "process of elimination" which means that you have to speak at every single NPC and/or show your every item at every NPC to get clues. To make matters worse each NPC is far away from each other. There are only some teleport points in the game.\n\nCat + electricity puzzle really messes around with you. FIrst you think that you have to carry the cat. Then there is also that damn elevator which looks like a power generator. You also have to speak to the same NPC multiple times to get important clues.\n\nIn worm riding puzzle it's really obvious what to do and you even know where you have to go but the damn spot where you have to use the item is definitely NOT clear. There a sign which says that the worm is BEYOND that point but actually the sign is the spot where you have to use the item. To make it worse the next room contains a thing which looks like a worm but is not it.\n\nDynamite puzzle requires you to collect materials but you have one missing material. It is not clear that you have to speak to certain NPC to get it. There is a potential that player wastes time by searching THE WHOLE GAME WORLD just to find that material.\n\n\n\nI can recommend this game for ~5€ but not for the current price (9,99€).","January 6","false","7.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Silly restrictions of items put into place and no natural direction or player guiding litter a game with severe design problems left and right, which is a shame because it seems like the game engine itself is capable of bring out a great game. It's the kind of game that I hate: one where I can see the design elements really not playing well to what the game is trying to be, and me questioning every little decision that was made in order to get there. If you are a masochist at heart and don't mind putting up with wandering endless for no good reason, Mystik Bell may slightly have what you need, but honestly, it's a game that I would avoid, which is sad because there's a lot of wasted potential here.\n\n+:\nArt style hits all the right points, makes the world feel alive, and the different creatures stand out in several different ways.\nStory elements seem reasonable, even if it's not the main focus.\n-:\nIf you love backtracking, then ok. If you love ridiculously backtracking, then this game is for you. I don't. Not when it's completely unnecessary.\nVery stupid decision to put an item limit on KEY ITEMS TO PROGRESS in place. This causes endless backtracking as you aren't given that many clues on exactly what you need for what portions of the map.\nWhy is the item usage and selections, as well as talking to a character, mapped to the same button? It makes absolutely no sense, resulting in repeated talking or item failure usages that could have easily been avoidable.\nLevel Design suffers with barely reachable jumps at times, as well as some silly enemy placement. Designers didn't understand the strengths of Metroidvania genre in regards to level design.\nDon't ever allow enemies to spawn with you entering the room, right on top of you. Especially when the player can easily die to that. That's just frustration at its finest.\nDue to all the above combined, you're left frustrated all over the place. You don't know what to do, and in particular, you're just confused.\nLimited combat variety, but that could be due to not getting far enough.","May 22, 2015","false","1.8"," 44 of 108 people (41%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","41","44","108","7","0"

You play a tiny witch, Belle, who has been wrongly accused of ruining a brew and must metroidvania yourself around the school to try and make things right.  The dialogue here is quite amusing and there is a large amount of it.\n\nThe game can be down right hilarious with how nonchalant it is and how Belle herself realizes things other characters would take novels to realize and complains of how ridiculous it is.  When I say it is an adventure game though, take that to heart.  Inventory puzzles with occassional moon logic and all.  It gives you the same feeling of accomplishment for figuring out a puzzle, but can also leave your head scratching.  The metroidvania nature of it is quite basic, but still fun and addictive.\n\nThe game's music is quite catchy, though it needs more tracks as there are only a handful throughout.  The strongest point of argument I can make for Mystik Belle is the art.  The sprites in this game are beautiful, from the huge bosses to the unique look and feel off all the NPCs it is a true masterpiece of 2-d artwork.  The animations in the game, for some bosses or events, can be a bit limited or off, but overall I find it visually quite appealing.\n\nThe game will keep you busy for several hours, though admittedly some of that is back tracking.  Honestly, I do recommend it though.  It's much more engaging and fun than old school adventure games, but still has a lot of their charm in puzzle solving and questing.\n\nDespite some claims of bugs or making the game unwinnable, I've never run into a situation like that.  Unlike Kings Quest, for example, death kicks you back to the beginning with all your items in tact, getting scolded by your head teachers and any place you can drop an item, you can get it back.  The game, for me, works quite well, though I do recommend a 360 controller to make the experience more enjoyable.\n\nGive it a try.

For me, they were just something that I never really felt compelled by and didn't have much fun with. I'm not a speedrunner, I seldom go for 100% completion in games, and to me these kinds of games really do encourage if not require you to have such tendencies to get the most out of the game.\n\nWith that said, I knew what I was going into before I started the game, having watched a few episodes of Let's Play episodes on Youtube. Eventually, I just found myself so charmed by the whole aesthetic and presentation of the game and decided that I didn't want to spoil myself further and just went to play it for myself.\n\nI think what it was that sold me on this game was the odd mix of point-and-click gameplay with the standard metroidvania formula. The dialogue with NPC's and taking breaks in empty rooms to discover solutions to puzzles was a welcome departure from time to time when previously I was platforming and dodging enemies/projectiles. (Which to note, I didn't find myself having too much trouble with. Due to the rather generous HP/damage ratio, outside of some boss fights which required me 1-2 deaths to figure out their patterns, most of the game wasn't overly difficult, barring a few select rooms I could mention which were particularly brutal at first) It wasn't just because it provided a break from the other half of the gameplay though, but because I genuinely found myself taking an interest in the world and characters, which probably sounds odd considering the type of game it is. Sure, there isn't a huge amount of dialogue or world building to fill out an elaborate backstory, but there's just enough information given to the player that over my time of playing I found myself filling in the blanks and developing my own in-head cannon that was oddly both equally satisfying and interesting. Though, that may just be my nerdy tendencies.\n\nStill, you're encouraged to indulge the NPC's and their dialogue, because while they give you interesting tidbits about the world, they also give you clues regarding the point-and-click aspects of the game. The game is pretty good about giving you clues about where to go and what to do, with me only having to consult the forums on one ocassion where I'd failed to have noticed something rather obvious.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that there are some bugs which I ran into but nothing ever rendered the game unplayable. (Falling out of bounds when you get wedged between a moving platform and spikes for example, but with that you can just exit and re-load and it will put you at the start of that screen) From what I've seen on the steam forums, the developer has done an excellent job fixing issues as they pop up, so I don't condemn it overly so for it.\n\nWith Mystik Belle, I feel that the developer was quite aware of the issues some players may have had with both point-and-click games -and- metroidvania games and made a game which brought the two of them together in a way that wouldn't alienate or scare off anyone not familiar with the genres. (NPCs offer the aforementioned helpful hints and dialogue, while bosses are all near the handy teleporters which offer quick access back to the room to re-try should you die) As someone who doesn't play either form of game much at all, I found myself progressing steadily through the game, with occasional hitches and challenges, and enjoying every minute of it from both the gameplay and charmingly silly characters. Casually playing through, it took me about 7 hours to reach the true end, and I can definitely see myself playing through again despite my usual tendencies of not doing so.\n\nFor a 13 dollar pricetag, while I admitedly had some hesitation at first, (Look, I'm stingy) It was definitely worth it. Even if you don't usually play metroidvania-esque games or find point and click logic unbearable, if you look at the trailer or watch some footage on youtube and find yourself charmed enough to be tempted, you'll probably find yourself having a good time.","June 29, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
