It's got crappy graphics and looks like it's from 1998!\n\nLet's ignore those facts for a moment. Suspend your disbelief, if you will. What's going on beneath the surface with the game mechanics?\n\nAs of this review writing, I've got 305 hours spent on this game (I'm a bit ashamed of that). So, there's something being done right here. It certainly scratches a lot of my itches and gives me what I'm looking for.\n\nIn terms of strategy, there are multiple layers of complexity. You're first introduced to the game in a small starting scenario which introduces the game mechanics to you. Most of the time, you are moving your hero armies around on the campaign map. On occassion, your hero will get into a tactical battle against monsters or other heros. This takes place on a hexagonal grid system and each side takes turns moving all of their creatures.\n\nThe battles are quite tactical. Your creatures come in 4 different tiers of strength. Each unit comes with certain strengths and weaknesses, and abilities. For example, the thief has a dagger strike which poisons his foes and doesn't let them counter attack. However, the thief doesn't have a lot of HP or armor, so they can easily be killed. Archers can't shoot at adjacent enemies, so they have to move away. Sometimes, your archers can only move away and can't act, so adjacent units can keep following them and killing the archers. So, you certainly want to protect the archers with blocking melee units. The game also has a pretty interesting list of battle spells. If you can't get behind a melee wall to the squishy archers, you could always resurrect one of the dead corpses as a zombie which can do the job. Just as well, the enemy could do that to you! So, to prevent that, you want to move your creatures on top of corpses to prevent their reanimation. That could also cause you to move onto a strategically disadvantageous position. Every army has a hero leading it, so the heros also directly participate in the battles. Heros can become very, very powerful as they level up. I find that an appropriately maxed warrior can pretty much solo every fight, but that strategy won't work forever.\n\nYour kingdom consists of your capitol and any conquered provinces. Each province yields a little bit of mana and/or gold per turn. This mana and gold is used for spells and recruiting units or constructing buildings. Some provinces will have strategic resources (such as logs) which will reduce the building costs of a building within your capitol. Each province can be improved to provide more resources. It seems that every turn, there are also a bunch of random events which happen within your kingdom. You have to read each event story and navigate a dialogue tree to respond to the event in some way. Each dialogue choice has a variable chance that it creates a favorable result or a negative result. The game events work on a sort of "karma" system, where choosing the "evil" choices results in negative karma but a short term gain, and choosing the "good" choice results in positive karma but generally incurs a cost. Over time, if your karma becomes really good, your kingdom will be flooded with positive events. If your karma becomes bad, you get flooded with bad events which get progressively more expensive.\n\nMeanwhile, you also also contending against one or more AI players who usually play with a slight advantage (cheaters!). You have to play particularly well in order to beat the AI.\n\nThe game is also a bit unforgiving. You can't really just start a level, save at turn 15, play to turn 25, and then reload turn 15 if things go bad. The save game system only allows you to go back one turn, and if you reload, it also penalizes you by subtracting from your final score. You can restart an entire scenario from the beginning, but that too has a campaign cost (in terms of astral energy). So, you don't want to screw around and experiment. In some scenarios, an enemy wizard will directly attack your home world and you have to fend them off. If you lose, that's it. Game over. You lose. Roll credits. No reloading and trying again.\n\nIn the campaign mode, you select which "shards" you want to conquer. Each shard unlocks two or more buildings for your capitol for each subsequent scenario. Some shards are extremely difficult to conquer if you don't have sufficient tech. So, you have to pick carefully which shards you want to conquer and in which order you want to conquer them based on the buildings they unlock.\n\nThis game is very fun, very interesting, and very complex. If you can look past the graphics, I highly recommend it for any strategy minded players. There is a newer version of this game out which pretty much is this exact game (in terms of mechanics) but overhauls the graphics and UI (ooh, pretty sparkles!).\n\nThere is only one significant downside to the game, and that is the drawback of its unforgiving save game system. I encountered a problem midway into one of my campaigns where my save game file got corrupted somehow. Since there wasn't any previous saved games, I lost hours of progress. I almost lost my entire campaign! I had to restart my shard scenario from the beginning.\n\nCurrently, I haven't been playing this game lately because I am stuck on a particularly difficult invasion. An enemy wizard decided to attack my homeworld and the AI difficulty is set very high. In the three times I've tried, I can't seem to beat him. I must fight him off, and if I lose, the game is completely over. I've given up for now, but maybe in a few months I'll try again.","May 9, 2014","true","378.6"," 47 of 48 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","47","48","0","0"

Mix HoMM with Age of Wonders, some Civilization and add bonus content and it it Eador: Genesis. Game is very complex and, depending of your skills and terrain available, you might choose plenty of different approaches.

This game is hard, so far as there is almost no documentation that can help you understand every singe battle/challenge/random event.  About the only thing you can do is dive in, play, lose, and do it all over again (I re-ran the tutorial about 3 times).  But once you do learn, and you conquer your first shard, well I for one was hooked.\nThis is not a game that you can ever just bide your time with, building up enough of an army, and a powerful enough hero.  Yes these are the things you must have to win, but the computer opponents are doing exactly the same things, and in many cases, they are much more aggressive.  You can find yourself surrounded, fighting to keep the enemy out of your strongholds, when only rounds earlier you thought you had the game well in hand.  Yes it is somewhat repetative (part of the game getting easier is that you eventually start to know what pattern or solution to a given "random" event is best), and there are times that it will feel unfair, but trust me.  When you bull rush an enemy strong hold, kill off 2 of his heroes, siege his castle, then finally banish him, all before HE was able to break away, then you too will know how much fun this game can be!","December 23, 2013","true","134.2"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

The references to the HoMM series are certainly apt, as even on the easiest difficulties Eador can be somewhat unforgiving at times with its checkmate AI making a nuisance in every uncovered corner. The amount of content is basically unlimited, which would be normally be a frustration for a completist such as myself, but oddly it's become instead one of the game's attractions and now I look at Eador as an excellent drop in/drop out strategy game, one I could actually beat were I to 'drop in' for about 300 hours or so.\n\nIn addition to the skirmish style single player, Eador also offers a campaign mode consisting of 80 randomly generated 'scenarios', which apparently allows you to say you've 'beaten' the game should you be perserverent enough to successfully conquer 80 maps, any of which could take the better part of a day to complete. The gameplay and controls are solid, and although Eador can feel repetitive at times, it's no fault of the game's design but rather the frequent battles that often play out in familiar fashion. It's like a casual drop in strategy game that's been given a surprising sense of depth, and that in turn gives a satisfying weight to your daily bouts.

Once I upgraded it refused to run at all.\n\nIf you are looking to still play it however (Which you should, it's a great game.)

You're the Hero, the commander of your army, you go explore the land and you actually fight.\nYou improve your Hero and buy armor and weapons, and customize it to some sub-classes.\n\nWith all that said, all that fails: The customization is completely random; at every level-up you are given 3 RANDOM "masteries" and choose to boost one. They're not useless but you can't choose what you want to become.\nIf none of the masteries is what you want, then you HAVE TO choose the "passive" or "main" (say Magic Dmg for Wizard, Attack for Warrior, Range plus Attack for Scout).\nSorry, but for a RPG feature this is a SHAME. You don't actually know how many masteries are or when are you getting the one you'll like. You don't even know which are the sub-classes or what skills will you need. You can't customize your Hero the way you want knowing NOTHING.\n\nThen again, the army recruitment and management system is terrible: You pay many kinds of soldiers to help you in battle. They level up and get some stats, skills and stuff... then in some random not-favorable battle they die and... your time spent in that unit, developement and EVERYTHING is just destroyed and you have to hire a lvl 0 unit again.\n\nThere's only one "save slot" for Campaign Mode, so if you want to try a class, you have to erase your previous game data.\nIf you played lets say... 30 hours the Warrior and you need a rest or you want to try a new Hero, you're gonna LOSE 30 hours of your life just to find you hate the Scout and want your Warrior back.\n\nThe autosave is also annoying because every time you exit the Campaign, it autosaves. This means you learn the game from your mistakes, but the hardest way possible, and nothing can be undone.\n\nWell, if you don't mind some of these features and just like the strategy and empire building... this game is maybe for you.\nDefinetly not for me.","May 15, 2015","false","18.3"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","8","24","2","1"
