All achievements and collectables unlocked.\n\nThis game was an absolute pleasure to play. It's a short indie game telling a mature story of a young girl and her broken family trying to come back together as they make painful choices, solve difficult situations, and all the while unraveling a mysterious tale of science & intrigue closer to the heart than expected.\n\nI understand this may not be for everyone... but the deciding factor I believe we should all consider is this is a very affordable, small-team, indie game worth experiencing. That said, the amount of storytelling I experienced was amazing.\n\nIf it is worth anything, I have a background in animation as a storyboard artist... I am especially keen to stories that feel "thought through" from start to finish, and not merely trying to get to certain moments or even the climactic finale just for the sake of it. This story has scenes from the whole way through that truly made my wife & I get pretty darn sad.  Stay for the end...\n\nThe difficulty is quite easy, and that may throw some people off... in my opinion however I enjoy story over challenge, so making all the collectibles glaringly obvious throughout only made me focus on their content and how it intertwined with the story rather than the pursuit. This is very subjective, so those looking for a hard time may be turned off. I've read here & there some having troubles with the shadow puzzles; this again is a tough one, as I got through all of them pretty easy... the most I spent was maybe 20-25 minutes on the last act's few big ones... still, the visuals and little rewards you are given with wonderful voice acting or visual design was well worth it.\n\nSpeaking of voices, the acting was tremendous. We especially enjoyed the voice of Didi, as child voice overs can sometimes be a hit or miss.\n\nVisually the game is an absolute joy to experience. Didi and Dawn are interesting, and I even grew to love the wonderful silhouettes of the characters around them. The soundtrack is very well thought out and you can clearly see the sound & visuals were designed hand in hand to compliment each other.\n\nI know reviews can be a subjective mess for some, but I hope this helps in whatever way it can! I'm a pretty level-headed, patient man who really appreciates good art & story. If this isn't your cup of tea, I again remind you it was a fifteen dollar purchase that definitely wouldn't make you regret the experience.\n\nI'm not a hardcore "anti-big publisher / developer" gamer, but I do want to say, humbly, that games like this make me so hopeful and excited about indie games. They provide an intimacy and patience in story I don't see often enough in the AAA titles.\n\nVery best regards,\nDDCP","November 27, 2013","true","4.2"," 309 of 319 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","309","319","0","8"

One of the real treats of the game is the music - perfect jazz and sexy voice of Kat Malenkaya (what a nice character name). The main  theme reminds me of a song "I wish you love" from "Eye of the Beholder" and Jessica Rabbit's "Why don't you do right". It is so romantic, sensual and emotional. Dawn is a very interesting main character (now I want those striped leggings), but I want to know more about her, her mysterious story was not fully told. Contrast is a game full of beauty, the dialogs make you sympathize with characters, 1920's Paris, the lights, burlesque and the circus are absolutely gorgeous. There are couple dissapointments - the movements (jumps) are glitchy and the game is too short. Thats it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/224460/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","There are so many cool ideas floating around Contrast without a vessel to carry them.\n\nA puzzle platformer focused around shadows in a wondrous 1920's Paris, it showcases so much potential but fails to utilize it into something compelling. There's a sense developer Compulsion Games wanted to do a lot more with the concepts they introduce, but whether for time or budget reasons were forced to dial back and condense the experience, the results of which are often middling at best.\n\nContrast opens itself from the start with a desire to tell a dark, complicated story of a family split apart, with a husband in debt to some bad people, a mother who just wants the best for her child, and said child blissfully unaware of the trouble surrounding her as she just wants both her parents back. It's promising beginnings however are quickly cast aside for poorly written reunions, characters that seem to recognize the own stupidity of their actions yet follow them anyway, and a juxtaposition of science fiction elements that are all rushed and strung together as if the writer lost sight of the narrative halfway through and began grasping at straws to tie it all together.\n\nEverything interesting about Contrast's plot, from its world of shadow people, impossible environmental deformation, and female led cast are underutilized and painfully unexplored. I wanted to know more about what was happening but all I ever got were a handful of documents left lying around which sketch out a scenario so haphazard and contrived that the story is worse off for including them. Compulsion went through the trouble of making a great environment for your character to explore, but stretched it too thin while simultaneously having nothing to discover if you want to deviate from the set path. It's a lifeless, sterile city that seems so mysterious from afar but ultimately has nothing to show you as you make your way through its barren streets as quickly as possible.\n\nContrast's main mechanical hook of being able to jump into shadows is on paper really neat and creates an immense about of possibilities for puzzle designs and world navigation, but like everything in Contrast it's underdeveloped and poorly implemented. The places you're able to shadow jump (for lack of a better term) are fairly minimal, and you spend more of your time walking around in the real world lifting boxes and trying to control your finicky character. When Contrast works it's tedious and does a lousy job explaining its mechanics, opting for style over engaging gameplay which gets lost under the mountain of technical issues.\n\nYour character moves awkwardly as if it's a puppet trying to break free of its strings. I was constantly clipping on edges while attempting to platform onto places I needed to, and even simply entering shadow mode failed more often than not, sending me careening to my death as an obnoxious restart sound bite played for the umpteenth time. Audio, graphical, and performance issues round out the family of technical incompetency that more than anything sell home the fact that Contrast needed more time in the oven.\n\nWith how great the foundation of Contrast is, to see it come together in such a halfbaked manner is truly unfortunate. There's a very clear vision amid the mediocrity that the developer had much bigger plans than the neutered length allowed them to execute, which makes it so disappointing they weren't able to hold the game back from release until they could be better implemented. I hope this isn't the last I see of Compulsion, but I pray they're given a better time frame for future projects that allows them to capitalize on the potential they almost completely missed this time around.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 14, 2014","false","2.6"," 264 of 345 people (77%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","77","264","345","9","10"

The artwork is gorgeous and simulates a surreal, detailed world in an atmosphere similar to France in the 1920's. The soundtrack is also amazing and fits the game and environment perfectly. Contrast is overall quite original, from the shadow-shifting between two different worlds to the special artistic style.\n\nIt takes about 5 to 6 hours to complete. You could think this is rather short, but the delightful artwork really makes up for it. This game really is a story-driven experience, so if you're not into this, maybe this isn't really the kind of game for you.\nI really like the story and the characters. They did a great job on the voice acting. The story is touching, lovely and well thought out, kind of mysterious due to the two different worlds. In the end, I still don’t really know which one’s “real” and which one isn’t.\nThe puzzles are special because of the shadow-shifting mechanism. Each puzzle is different, fun and challenging, not repetitive in my opinion.\nSometimes the game's a bit buggy, like the shadow-shifting mechanism between 3D and 2D at certain moments. The camera can also be a bit buggy and clumsy sometimes, but it doesn’t ruin the game.\n\nSomething you need to know: you can't change the controls. The game works with a QWERTY-setting, so keep this in mind. You can also play this with a controller, which I think suits the overall controls better. I still have to try this, though.\n\nIf it’s in sale, buy this immediately.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/224460/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","We follow the story of a young girl called Didi, viewed from the perspective of Dawn, her imaginary friend. Didi’s parents have a troubled relationship to stay the least. Her father is constantly falling in with the wrong crowd, while her mother is struggling to make a name for herself as a singer. Didi takes it upon herself to mend their marriage, with a lot of help from Dawn. No one else can see her, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t exist, as she has the ability to switch from the 3D real world into the 2D shadows.\nIt is a really interesting mechanic that has you relearning what you know about puzzle games, much in the same way that Portal did back in 2007, but sadly not to the same extent. There are some very clever puzzles to be solved here, but they are just not up to the same quality as Valve’s finest. Most of the game you will be moving physical objects around, or shining lights on them to create shadows. You can then run up to a flat surface and shift into it, and platform across the shadows as if they were physical objects.\nThere isn’t a great deal of variety though. In general if you can interact with something, you will know it needs to be used to solve the puzzle in some way. You gain a dash ability, which enables you to smash through real world objects, and more importantly to travel through solid shadows blocking your path, but other than that you will just be jumping. You can grab ledges and pull yourself up, but the game is very picky about which ledges you are allowed to grab. The platforming itself isn’t as precise as I would like it to be. Being able to clamber over the shadows of people as they are having a conversation looks really cool, but I was constantly slipping off or getting caught on little edges.\nThe first time I loaded the game up, I was about to hit New Game, as you would expect. But then I stopped. The song that was playing over the menu was so good, that I sat there and listened to the whole thing before beginning my playthrough. It wasn’t long after that I was supposed to follow Didi to the next area, but instead I stuck around in the Ghost Note, a cabaret club, to catch the end of a song through the closed backstage door. The soundtrack in collaboration with Laura Ellis is superb, I just wish there were more of it later in the game. And that goes for the actual gameplay too.\nVisually it looks pretty good, with an obvious emphasis on contrast between light and shadow. Although the overall tone of the game is dark, there are some nice splashes of colour, and some really bright areas. The only character models in the game are that of Didi and Dawn, the rest of the characters are depicted only in shadow, a device used by much of the noir fiction that Contrast is based on. There are plenty of clichés from that era that the game falls back on, but it is never too cheesy. Despite the youth of the character that the story revolves around, the narrative is quite grown up, and definitely becomes more complex as it progresses. I got a very Bioshock Infinite vibe from it, although the storytelling and the world are not as in depth.\nThe games  premise is one of the most original I've seen in recent times, but it’s just not quite fleshed out enough. I would still recommend playing it to see the clever ways in which you can interact with the environments, and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout. I hope the ideas and themes can be perpetuated into a new game in the future.","July 13, 2015","true","8.9"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","43","48","0","0"

Its got a similar art style to Bioshock Infinite and Dishonored (although a little less refined) - which I loved in both those games - so I didn't hesitate to order when the game popped up on the store front for pre-order.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=201760763\nContrast sets its tale in the 1920's and contains a mix of Vaudeville and Film-Noir elements. This is where Contrast succeeds admirably. From the carnival atmosphere (something I imagine Coney Island would have looked like back in the 1920's) to its bitter-sweet tale of a child born to parents that have very little use or time for them. These are the kind of parents that never gave a second thought to what it actually means to raise a child simply because it looked like fun and then not dealing well with the intrusions to their personal lives and space that children bring along. It's also about how these kinds of children learn to cope in families like these by often retreating into fantasy worlds.\n\nNow if this where a movie it might have almost been one of those little indies that crosses over into the mainstream on its way to becoming a sleeper hit. With a heart-felt story about the perils of growing up somewhat unwanted and set within a striking sense of place, a wonderful jazzy 1920's soundtrack and a rather ingenious gaming world that makes use of the physical realm but also the planes that exist between light and shadows. So where did it go all so wrong? If Contrast was Compulsion Games first stab at a puzzler/platformer made by people who have never played a puzzle/platformer before in their lives then it shows. Now that I have finished the game - I would be loath to call Contrast anything but a success story considering the games platform mechanics are so God-dam awful. Simply put they are a complete mess.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=196189523\nFirstly - the games jumping mechanic barely functions the way one would expect when it comes to games of this nature - with precision. Getting too close to an object often results in the main gaming character (Dawn) unable to perform a jump of any kind. These invisible walls seem to work differently for almost every object you encounter in the game so it becomes a mix of frustration and anger when you begin your 10th attempt knowing full well that skill has very little to do with it. In fact you are better off casting your dice with lady luck to be honest! It doesn't end there however. Dawn has only two movement speeds (controlled by the left analog stick). Press down too hard on the control and Dawn will appear as if she has a rocket attached to her backside as she flies off in the direction you have indicated which often results in her falling to her death or from the particularly high level platform you have spend the last 30 minutes trying to successfully climb. The other movement speed is akin to watching paint dry and it doesn't help one iota that the movement controls are so super sensitive.\n\nDawn also has a rather annoying habit of constantly getting stuck in the environment which no succession of jump presses will resolve as she stands dead on the spot. This happens more often than not so frustration is going to run pretty high for those that don't tolerate this kind of stuff very well. There are a host of other problems like Dawn being able to pass through various solid objects but not others when in the physical realm. I lost count the amount of times I passed through a rope-lining because I pressed too hard on the twin-stick and went flying off the edge of the screen - passing though barriers and all. The save feature doesn't work either (why we PC gamers are still subject to this console save crap is beyond me) but on more than one occasion the game said it had saved my progress only for me to return and have to repeat sections of the game I had already passed before the game saved. Let me tell you how quickly annoying that gets in a short space of time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=195499806\nI suppose the biggest disappointment is that Contrast squanders it's rather novel concept around light and shadows. Required to traverse between the two planes successfully in order to compete the adventure disappointment settles in quickly when you realize that while the concept is awesome its totally squandered here. This ain't no Portal or Quantum Conundrum in terms of design and creativity. What we are left with is rudimentary and thoughtless. With such a novel gaming world concept you would think that it would have been successfully exploited and fleshed out. If you were expecting this then be prepared to feed on the bitter seeds of disappointment. I could scarcely believe I was playing the same game I was so eagerly anticipating since the trailer made it look so promising and exciting. Its like having a university student hand in a thesis with killer topic only to realize once you start reading it that they abandoned any creative thought after coming up with the title. The puzzles involving light and shadows are so simple that there is no challenge to them whatsoever. The game even starts phasing them out towards the end opting for the annoying "place this box on this lever plate to open this door". It was incredibly sad and annoying to see the game go this way especially when I had been rooting for it all year long.\n\nI really wanted to love this game but it's a mess on the game-play front and I simply have to ask did Compulsion Games even bother playing their own game because a lot of the games issues are so evident right off the bat and especially when your game relies on them so heavily too in order to be successful. A few more months of tweaking and fixing might have resulted in the game meeting expected platform standards, however, no amount of mechanics tweaking would be able to offset the dull realization that the main shows implementation falls completely flat. Rather purchase during a sale or at a discount price instead. As it stands this game is not worth the paltry $14.99 shape it finds itself in currently.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","December 15, 2013","false","7.0"," 100 of 144 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","100","144","0","18"

But it isn't perfect. The controls are noticably stiff at times, but one can argue that this is purposly design because your character is walking around in heels. Not much opened endedness, which seems like it should but you are stuck on a one way path. But, the good things about this game is the platforming sections and it's unique "shadow" mechanic. The platforming feels like it wasn't just a another "ok, let's just put this here, that there, and this over there" kinda platforming. I honestly felt like I was playing in a Banjo and Kazooie style platforming, something crafted over time and really thought about, not just something crafted in a few minutes. The story is kinda there, and not. Your character is utlimately ignored in the main story, only a few people will talk about your character. But they never provide much information about you, and your character never talks either...so that doesn't help with this mystery about your character. The game can be done in a matter of minutes, or a few hours, it all matters on your skill level and how fast you are capable of beating platformer games. But, I will tell you this, you won't regret this experiance if you liked banjo and kazooie.","November 25, 2013","true","12.5"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","47","58","0","2"

I will however touch on a few issues; the controls - the whole shifting into shadows and out again sometimes bugs out, tossing you out of shadows for no actual good reason. In addition, some puzzles require you to stand in a specific place before it'll show you the progress, having spent about 30 minutes trying to make an impossible jump I face palmed fiercely when I found out by accident that I simply needed to walk onto the shadow of a cigarette.\n\nHowever, those two issues aside? The game is worth the money, I wouldn't say you're getting spoiled rotten with content, but you will get an appealing little tale, with decent graphics, amazing music score, and a fresh take on the platforming genre.","October 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

After that you have to complete a few of jump sequences,....i fell a lot of times into nowhere and that was not that dramatic because you restart at the very same point where you made a mistake. So finally I was there,....and had to complete my very last task. To point with a spotlight at a specific point. That was not working. It didn't trigger the cutscene. So I had to go back to main menu and "resume" my game. But,...I was far away from the spotlight. So I had to complete all puzzles again.\n\nSo what I want to tell you with this? It's not perfect.

The story is pretty compelling as well, it has quite a few heavy subjects done in a way that seems genuine and not just thrown in for shock value...  The game has a few somewhat open areas to play through in each Act, the game is comprised of 3 acts,  each act will probably take about an hour or so.  The puzzles are fairly simplistic, although that isn't really a bad thing.\n\nThe story centers around a little girl known as Didi, she has an imaginary friend named Dawn, often being left alone at night so her mother can preform Didi enlist the help of her friend Dawn to sneak around in a landscape which is set in 1920.  Going along with Didi, the player (Dawn) will be introduced to numerous interesting characters shown only via their shadows.\n\nThe length of the game is rather short, I have 11 hours clocked in but over 8 of those hours were from  idling cards while I slept.  I played the game completely and got all the achievements in a little under 3 hours.\n\nI'd recommend this game for the gameplay, interesting art style and compelling story.

The game takes place in a Paris-like city in the 1920's and is also the debut for Canadian developer Compulsion Games.\n\nSTORY\nDidi's mother dumped her father a long time ago and since she is a singer at a night club, nobody is watching after Didi at night. Naturally, little Didi takes this as an opportunity to take her imaginary friend Dawn with her on a night-time scouting expedition throughout the city to discover that her father came back and tries to win the heart of her mother again. But something stands in the way...\n\nI'm not sure if I just didn't get the reason for this during my play or of this was a story element deliberately chosen by the developer to create a certain experience, but apart from Didi and Dawn, all characters in the game are shadows, so you never see them in 3D. This works out okay, but makes the city look fairly empty and liveless most of the time. Considering the beautifully designed enviroments, this is a bit of a shame.\n\nVISUALS\nThe game is based on the Unreal Engine, so visually the game looks really beautiful. The overall art deco style of the game, the level design and the lighting effects fit together perfectly and create an immersive atmosphere. Quite frankly, a lot of the visual elements remind of of Bioshock: Infinte which, funnily enough, is also based on the Unreal Engine.\n\nUnfortunately, as with many UE-based console games being released on PC, the game doesn't really offer a vast amount of graphics options. Apart from gamma, graphics quality, resolution and fullscreen there's nothing else to adjust through the game directly. Don't get me wrong: The game looks great regardless but definitely could've used a bit of Anti-Aliasing. This could probably be tweaked through the config files or external tools such as SweetFX or your graphics drivers directly, but personally that wasn't really worth the hassle for me, so I decided to stick with the options that were available.\n\nVOICE & MUSIC\nThe voice acting is surprisingly good for a non-AAA game like this. Didi's voice actor has that cute little girl's touch to her and really fits great to that character. Her imaginary friend Dawn, though, doesn't say a single word throughout the entire game, so whenever Didi talks to her (you), it always feels kind of weird that she never really answers. Might be one of those imaginary-friend-drawbacks, though. Who knows, heh.\n\nDidi's father is voiced by Elias Toufexis, who also voiced Adam Jensen in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I was definitely surprised to hear him in this game but recognized him right away because of his distinctive voice. Voice acting for the side characters, which often tends to be poor because of limited budget, is also pretty decent, so nothing to complain on that side.\n\nThe game being set sometime in the 1920's, it is accompanied by a fitting and relaxing Jazz-y soundtrack which fits the overall atmosphere of the game perfectly. Not exactly my musical taste, but then again, a Death Metal soundtrack wouldn't quite work in a game like this. Heh.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nYou control Dawn, the imaginary friend, and Didi effectively becomes your sidekick. Throughout the game, she will assist you with a couple puzzles but most of the time you will have to solve them on your own to clear the way for her, so you both can progress on your journey.\n\nThe main gameplay mechanic is the shadow shifting, which you will use to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles such as huge gaps and so on. How this works is, that you basically approach a shadow that is cast by certain objects in the level, hit the shadow shift key/button and Dawn transforms from a 3D character into a 2D shadow, allowing her to climb around on those shadows. Together with the dash ability, that you unlock relatively early into the game, this makes for some partially challenging platforming as often the shadows will move (because the objects that cast them move) and thus require you to time your actions.\n\nWhile this mechanic is pretty cool and unique and works out quite good, it often suffers from imprecision and the fact that you often get shifted back into 3D for no apparent reason. You can't die in the game and if you fall down into the void, you will simply respawn at the puzzle again. This makes failing not that much of a big deal, but keeps you wishing the developer had put a bit more fine-tuning into the gameplay mechanics to reduce or eliminite those annoyances alltogether.\n\nFor some puzzles, you have to move objects around such as wooden crates, serving carts or cardboard stand-ups, so they cast shadows in the right size and angle for you to be able to jump and move on them. This adds a bit of variety to the puzzles and demonstrates the impressive lighting effects the Unreal Engine is capable of.\n\nThe puzzles as such generally are farily obvious and easy. The challenge often lies in the platforming or the object manipulation that comes with them, so often you have figured out how the puzzles work but will eventually struggle with the right shadow setup or the right timing during the platforming itself.\n\nAll in all, it's definitely a cool mechanic but could've been pushed a bit further with a bit more extensive and varying puzzle design to actually test your combination rather than your platforming skills.\n\nPLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITY\nWith roughly 4 hours of playtime, which included collecting all collectibles and getting 100% of the achievements, the game is relatively short and could probably be beaten in around 3 hours if you just rush through it. There aren't any additional game modes, so, apart from replaying the story for the collectibles/achievements, there's nothing else to do in the game once you've beaten it.\n\nCONCLUSION\nContrast is a short but beautiful and charming puzzle platformer with a fairly unique gameplay mechanic.\nThe game undoubtedly has some minor flaws and annoyances, but if developer Compulsion Games is able to deliver such a debut, I'm definitely looking forward to see more of them - and more of Contrast.","December 28, 2013","true","4.0"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","2"

Puzzles are built around the concept of traversing shadows to get to places you could not otherwise reach. Unfortunately the execution is lacking. The game is VERY finicky when it comes to where you can enter the shadows and if you get even the slightest bit off while in shadow you'll pop back into the 3D world and have to begin what you were doing from the beginning.\n\nFurther, there's no educating the player going on at ALL. Studying Half-Life 2 and Portal's puzzle education should be mandatory for all aspiring puzzle game developers. On several occaisions Contrast throws some new concept at you and forces you to realize it's there. The end result is a game that you're fighting with in order to play instead of one you're figuring out. Frustration abounds, not because you cannot figure out what to do, but because the execution has to be pixel perfect or you have to start over.\n\nI would LOVE to be able to recommend Contrast. I really would. The music, the art style, the gameplay concept, the story of a kid with a troubled home life seeking to fix her world in any way she can. It's all great, but the core mechanics are just not there. Perhaps with some polish Contrast can become a game that I can recommend.

A simple three-dimensional platformer where a flick of the wrist turns into a two-dimensional platformer. Such a decision we have already seen in several projects, unlike Contrast - to use lights and shadows to create and manipulate level elements.\n\nContrast short game: Three acts can run for 2.5-3 hours, even with search collectibles and secrets. The final stories are so predictable that they are even insulting. The visual style and mood of the game promises some mystery , detective story or drama, and as a result we get some banal family history, a place that in some lowly daytime drama. A pity.\n\nGameplay:  This puzzling platformer built around the ability to turn into a two-dimensional character shadow. You press the button, the camera hangs somewhere on the side, and Dawn leaves from himself only a shadow in the form which overcomes obstacles and chasms . Depending on the shape you need to change the situation: a break in the wall will not go through the shadows, but to circumvent it in bodily form can be easily. On the other hand, the flesh will not leak, for example, through the glass, but the light (and shadow) will penetrate through it without any problems.\n\nEmotional Impact:  The emotional impact that you receive from the story is the jewel of Contrast.  This leaves you with a very memorable performance throughout the three acts.\n\nVisuals:  Incredibly stylish and beautiful thing. Almost every game screenshot can be long and enthusiastically regarded as if considering - a jazz fan, retro, cabaret and burlesque - the pleasure is doubled.\n\nStory:  The whole essence of Contrast - in the plot. Didi not the happiest child in the world : the parents at odds , mother rambles in the entertainment business , his father trying to deal with their problems , but even more breaks in them. But meanwhile, the sly little Didi goes into his inner world - a natural reaction of protection against the constant attacks of the vernal world. And the inner world in turn leads you, purely friendly shadow named Dawn\n\nSummary:  Contrast is a game full of heart, beauty, and at least a few excellent puzzles. It’s at its best when it marries its poignant story to its platforming, and at its weakest when it’s about moving boxes, but it rarely goes very long without showing us something worth playing.","November 27, 2013","true","22.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

The platforming is not too difficult and the puzzles worth the effort.  I found myself more apt to wander a bit to explore the world, but the game doesn't give you sandbox freedom. Voice acting is good, and the little girl steals the show.  My only complaint really is that platformng would occasionally get stuck on geometry.  The controls are okay - would be nice to be able to bounce off walls.  There were a few situations in Act 3 where a light cart would get stuck or a ball would end up in the wrong place and I was unable to move it back.  An addition of nice save spots in Act 3 would have been a good.  What could have better?...a bit more interaction with the little girl..with Dawn voiced.  That would help.

It's thick with noir atmosphere.\n\nBut you play as Dawn, a mysterious woman who can transform herself to a shadow and run on the walls whenever there is light. This is when the 3D gameplay changes to 2D. You can use same abilities in the 2D and the 3D world. Which aren't much, movenent, jump, interact  and dash. There is no combat in this game, but on one scene you need to use your wits to overcome an enemy.\n\nThe world and the characters look great, although the world is really empty. You can only see Dawn and Didi in this world. While others are shown only by silhouttes and this only happens in small cutscenes and other storytelling parts during the actual gameplay. The Jazzy soundtrack is really great whenever you get to hear it.

Some of the story is also explained with the collectibles only, so if you want to get the whole story you need to collect those.\n\nFun little game that clearly needed few months more developement time before publishing.\n\n\n[Score: 79]","July 14, 2015","true","3.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Remember how afternoons after school could be filled with fantastical worlds brought forth from the trees, the rocks, the tall grasses in the backyard or the field near your neighborhood: all you needed was your imagination. Remember as you went to sleep at night and stared at the shadows in your room, sometimes in wonder, and sometimes in fear of the shapes they made. Remember how life could be magical in the most ordinary of things and how, as you grew older, you longed for the days when reality didn't have to be so damned real all the time: homework, bills, politics, relationships, family...\n\nThat longing is at the heart of Compulsion Games' lavishly realized and gorgeous platformer adventure Contrast. Set in 1920s Paris, it paints a dreamlike world of cobblestone roads, nightclubs, and carnivals, all of which will at once remind you of Bioshock Infinite's art deco atmosphere, the simple drama of Hollywood's Golden Age, and with perhaps a helping of the musical Cabaret. Didi is the young daughter of a quarreling nightclub singer mother and a sometimes-there father who is trying to strike it rich with some shady investors but, as often is the case with shadiness, never quite seems to get a break. Didi copes with all of this with the help of the player in the form of Dawn, Didi's tall, waifish, silent imaginary friend, and the game leads Didi and Dawn through the nighttime town trying to help her family with their woes. To say any more of the plot would be a disservice to you, so let's move on to the gameplay.\n\nAnyone who recalls making shadow puppets on the wall as a kid will instantly feel in tune with the core mechanic here which involves Dawn's singular ability to become a shadow on the wall, quite literally. There is a sense of astonishment every time the game opens up a new platforming section because it is all done with light sources: streetlights and spotlights are switched on and suddenly and quite beautifully make the most ordinary setting, like the facade of a storefront or the walls of a hotel, into a visually striking obstacle course for Dawn to traverse. While sometimes the gameplay could occasionally be a tiny bit tighter, it never gets old to "shift" into shadow, and you will be challenged to think in some strange ways to solve some of the puzzles in your path. This is a mechanic as new and different as Portal's portal gun and it's something you will remember long after Didi and Dawn's story has concluded.\n\nThat conclusion, unfortunately, comes much too soon as this game is quite short on the order of four or five hours, although you could spend a long time marveling at the charming art style of the characters and the setting of the moonlit Paris suburb, not to mention looking for and gathering each of the areas' collectibles, which add little distinctly artful flairs to the main story here and there. Normally I would find this too short of a game, but I can't bring myself to complain and here's why. A lot of story-driven games want to say and do a tremendous amount of things in the course of their stories, because, understandably enough, the developers want to have as many opportunities as they can to wow the pants off you with crazy setpieces and wild spectacle. The trouble with that is they almost always seem to get off course somewhere along the line and it can feel like a total sensory overload that in the end leaves you reeling, and not always in a good way. (I'm looking at you, Bioshock Infinite.) But Contrast has a single story to tell through Didi's young eyes and, without distracting you with twenty different characters and eight bizarre environments and thirty different weapons, Compulsion Games excels at telling it, a very ordinary, touching, human and absolutely enchanting story. One of my top games of 2013 and I very much hope it receives the wide recognition it deserves in 2014.","January 3, 2014","true","8.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/224460/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionContrast is a wonderfully designed, story-based platformer and adventure game that combines intriguing puzzles with 2d shadow elements. Unfortunately, the game suffers from quite a few jarring issues, and I'm only recommending it because of a pretty interesting story.\n\nGameplayYou're Dawn, the 'imaginary friend' of a little girl named Didi, and you'll go around with her discovering a pretty intriguing story involving Didi's parents. Now I won't reveal anything more about it, since the story is the best part about the game. So what about the actual gameplay? Well you usually have puzzles to solve involving shadows. Dawn can go into shadows, anywhere that light is blocked by an object, and she can move along a 2d environment whilst in the shadows. This is a very promising mechanic, but unfortunately it can feel rather clunky at times. To be honest, the idea was a very good one, but the execution was a little less satisfying. Puzzles were very creative, and never felt too difficult to solve at any point, but some interactions were rather slow and boring, turning the excitement from discovering a really cool puzzle into a boring waste of time. There were a lot of mini-cutscenes constantly interrupting gameplay which made the game feel a lot more laggy than it should.\n\nBut the gameplay was not all bad. It had some really fun moments, including a minigame where you played a shadow character inside of a story, moving light sources/objects around to manipulate shadows and even shadow dashing through some timed objects in order to reach a certain platform. There are many collectibles to get and they are divided by Acts. Each act has its own set of collectibles and achievements, so if you're interested in getting those, I'd suggest you follow a guide because this game has one glaring issue here. Bugged achievements.\n\nAfter completing the game for the first time, I went to each specific chapter in order to get the required achievements/collectibles for those sections. However some of them took a couple tries to even work, and one refused to work no matter what I did. I had to start a completely new game and get all the collectibles in order to finally get the last achievement. And the bugs aren't limited to achievements or collectibles, oh no. There are a lot of glitchy areas in game which can cause you an immense amount of frustration depending on how hard the game is for you in the first place. I've managed to collect everything and complete the game, but others have had issues with various bugs, so be aware of this.\n\nVisualsContrast shines with its unique, noir-film styled game. Every aspect of the game feels like something from an 80s film. Lowering the graphics to the lowest setting removes most of that look, but the characters will dress the same nonetheless. Environments are well designed, and actually rather beautiful...the interiors that is. The world that you're in, is empty, lifeless, and generally boring. It's unappealing to walk around anywhere outside, but the interiors feel like something you'd want to be in. Again I'm conflicted here.\n\nAudioFinally, something I can totally recommend without hesitation. The opening music is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. The voice-acting is top-notch. Every aspect of the sound is golden and really sells the feeling of the game. I'm just sad we can't buy the soundtrack on Steam yet, because I'd happily buy that in a heartbeat.\n\nSummaryWell this is an interesting game to say the least. It has really good ideas for gameplay, an amazing story, a unique visual style and creative puzzles as well. However my experience in the game has not been without its share of frustrations, and I think it is important to consider those issues as well. I'm going to recommend the game based on the story and music only. The world did not appeal to me whatsoever and the countless bugs/glitches really took me for a ride.\n\nSo now, if you as a buyer can appreciate the fine selling point this game has, and you are willing to deal with less than fluid gameplay, then you'll have an enjoyable experience playing Contrast. If not, this game probably isn't for you.\n\n6.5/10 - Good ideas, flawed execution.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Apart from the one feature that makes this game unique (Shadow-Shifting), Contrast is your basic 3D platforming game. The best way I can describe it would be for you to take the gameplay mechanics of Alice: Madness Returns and mix it with the atmosphere from that of the movie Barlesque. That's actually the perfect example of what we have here.\n\nTo start, there's some things this game does extremely well, the storyline for one, is fairly captivating. Contrast's story revolves not on the main character but actually a young girl who you accompany throughout the game. The emotion of the story takes hold of you from the very beginning, leaving for no disconnection for the 3 and a half hour journey.\n\nThe art style is very nice. It's almost a cel-shading effect, but the game lacks visual settings and options for use if anti-aliasing, fov, and other things that could have really enhanced the visual experience quite a bit. Still, not at all a bad looking game. Despite it lacking anything technically deep, there were times where I looked at a setting and said "Wow... this is simple but just so beautiful in that simple yet effective kind of way." After awhile, you learn the hard way that even though only some walls are fun to shift into to. Some others make you scratch your head and think "What was the point of this? Why am I able to shift on an object that causes me to spaz out" things of that nature. These small detection errors can cause puzzles to be frustrating at times but still, when it's done right, it works and it's fun.\n\nThere's some things this game does extremely well, the storyline for one, is fairly captivating.

I was expecting something more and a lot harder. The larger puzzles still only take a few minutes to solve. If you're looking for a real puzzle game, you will be dissapointed.\nHowever, the atmosphere of the game is great: the puzzles tie in nicely with the story, the collectibles (documents and photos) are actually worth collecting, as they add some background to the story and the story is quite funny at times.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge, this game probably isn't for you. If you're looking for a nice story with a bit of player interaction, you'll most likely enjoy this. However, I'd suggest you wait 'til the game is on sale, as you'll easily play through it in under 4 hours.\n\nIn short: Are you looking for a good story? Get this when it's on sale, it's very enjoyable but too short! Are you mainly interested in puzzles? Better look for a more dedicated puzzle game.","October 29, 2014","true","3.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I recently bought the game while it was on special and have been very, very disappointed with it. Let me explain:\n\nThe game, overall, has immense potential. The plot was quite interesting (for an 70's/80's setting), but you keep waiting for that 'oomph' factor that never arrives. Instead, you're reduced to a puppet who follows the instructions of a little girl who ultimately, towards the end, becomes very annoying.\n\nYour character learns some valuable skills, which you will probably never need to use ever again. Its just disappointing. Certain skills (like dash) you might need later on, depending on how you play really.\n\nThe controls are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥. ABSOLUTE. ♥♥♥♥♥. You think I'm joking? Go ahead and play this game and then join me in saying its ♥♥♥♥♥, because it is. I don't know about those who used a controller, but for anyone using a keyboard, I'm so sorry. I can imagine what you may have gone through because of this game.\n\nThe camera IS WORSE. Its terrible. Absolutely terrible. I can rarely turn a corner WITHOUT the camera making a 360 around me. I honestly need to pause and regather my surroundings before moving on.\n\nTHE SHIFTING. OMFG. The shifting in this game is an absolutely wonderful concept but you'll rarely need it for any good purpose. You only need to shift to move objects, solve puzzles, and very rarely, to attain items. THAT IS ALL. To make matters worse, sometimes you will get stuck as soon as you shift, unable to move at all, OR you'll suddenly be thrown out of your shift (this is often not going to be your fault).\n\nThe game is set in a very surreal map that's sloppily done. You can easily glance through walls, end up in several hundred glitches, die making a very small jump, think you have discovered a secret area where you might find an item only to discover that its a dead end that the developers left to screw with you. Haha. Screw this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nIn all faireness, Contrast is an exceptionally interesting puzzle game which I would have highly recommended, however, as it stands, I'm afraid I cannot. Like many others have mentioned, if you do find this game on sale (75 - 95 percent off) then grab it and give it a try, otherwise, you're better off saving that cash for something else.","September 7, 2015","false","4.9"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","30","48","2","0"

It's a stylized, animated style which summons up a surreal Jazz Age Paris (?). It's affecting and evocative and surprisingly detailed.\n\nThe game's shadow-shifting mechanic is novel, and the puzzles I've encountered thus far are unusual, but not frustratingly so. The story's the thing here, in the end, and the traversal puzzles and the jumping are just what you do while moving through -- and moviing forward -- the plot.\n\nUltimately, this is a game which tells a story. It's told mostly through cutscenes, but the voice acting is generally superior, and the writing is solid, which keeps it all interesting. As has been said, there's a vaguely Bioshock feeling to the storytelling -- there's a mystery unfolding, and a faint air of tragedy or melancholy surrounding events, as if something sad is about to occur, unless it can be outrun or outthought.\n\nYou play as the shadow-shifting "imaginary friend" of a little girl named DiDi, whose parents are on the edge of serious trouble. The game doesn't fully explain itself at the start. and certain events make you wonder if the often surreal landscape you move through is simply reality colored by a young girl's imagination or something ... else ... yet to be discovered.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, of course. The shadow-shifting mechanic doesn't always activate as intended, forcing retries of a jump puzzle sequence. Also, for Steam PC users, the controls for this game were clearly designed for consoles, so if you have a USB game controller hooked to your PC, you'll almost certainly have a better time using that.\n\nAnd again, the puzzles and the narrative style of Contrast will not appeal to every gamer, but if you're intrigued, I'd say take a look.\n\nContrast may well be a flawed gem, in some ways, but it's still a gem. Gamers often say they want "something different" in their gaming. Here it is. Recommended.\n","October 17, 2014","true","4.4"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","2"

This meant that the entire chapter had to be replayed, including the collection of the luminaries. Many puzzles were far too easy, and often seemed as if the solution was directly given to the player. The game seemed choppy and could have had much more fluidity. Contrast was fun when there were no bugs interfering with my playthrough, but rarely was I fully immersed in the game.","November 17, 2013","false","5.2"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

Some were catching up with old friends like Half-Life 2 and remembering the good old days; others were becoming well aquainted with the new guy in town, his name was Far Cry 4 and he was busy wowing people left and right with his fantastic adventures. Yet in between seeing someone introducing themselves to Octodad with hysterical laughter and another person meeting Bioshock Infinite for the first time, a young lady caught my eye. She seemed different, almost as if there was a charm to her existence that pierced the heavens with her classy look; it's as if she had just arrived in town, yet I could have sworn I met her before.\n\nI asked someone sitting at the bar next to me who she was. The response was worse than what I had expected, "Oh that's Contrast, lovely girl; I heard she's pretty cheap too but I wouldn't risk the missus finding out so I don't know personally." What a dissapointment, I must've seen her standing on the side of the road one day; and to think, for a $15.00 I could've gotten to know her better, but I was a taken man myself. I place heavy emphasis on the WAS. My night wasn't getting any better, I was lonely, depressed, I needed to feel something again and I figured she would be the one.\n\nI walked up to her and introduced myself, she hardley seemed interested in what I thought of her, yet her artistic nature spoke volumes to me. "What's a classy platformer like you doing in a bar like this?" She turned away from me, almost as if she was preparing for the onslaught of abuse I had planned for her. "Do you like platformers?" her voice was shaking, she felt the judgement of the whole bar raining down on her as we talked. I leaned in close, grabbed her shoulders and whispered, "I love platformers." She turned back around, her face was stone cold but I could see into her eyes, they were filled with happiness and ecstasy; I must've been the nicest person she's met in years because she said, "for you it will be $3.00." Now I may not be a detective, but from the way her eyes rolled towards the ground, I could tell she already regretted dropping the price for me. That didn't stop me from accepting the offer, but I did feel like I should give her more anyways, just so she feels better about herself.\n\nWe head back to my place, this couch has seen much action but this was a rare exception. How could someone of this beauty and elegance possibly put up with her lifestyle. Just before I turned off the lights, I touched her back and brought her close, I could hear her breathing intensify. But she didn't bring me in closer, she pushed me away; she answered my confusion with a question of her own, "can I sing for you first?"\n\n"What?"\n\n"Most clients love it when I sing to them before... we get down to business."\n\nA little confused, I figured it would be best if she was as comfortable as possible before we began, so I gave her permission. (Listen to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB_RzlqbV98). As she started singing, I got mesmerized. Her story was strong and to the point, she has been hurt, perhaps that's what lead her down this road; her voice was beautiful, the song was perfectly put together, slow, smooth and reflected what to expect from this game.\n\nContrast is one of a very small group of games where I feel the artistic vision is met to my satisfaction and doesn't appear to be trying too hard or too little to get across what it wants to portray. You view the situations that happen throughout the story both through the eyes or an innocent child and your own personal observations, giving the game a sort of dual perspective that leave the second part entirely up to your own observations. There is a plot twist as well that leads to a revelation I couldn't even fathom feeling for myself, leaving my reaction up to what the child felt when everything was revealed to her. The bond you have with the child as you play all while being a silent observer of the story made me feel different from other games, almost like another game I played recently and would love to play again (not going to mention it here).\n\nOther than the story, the gameplay and graphics seem to compliment eachother really well. The game takes place in  a Noir styled France stuck in a sort of purgatory where people can switch between either being a shadow or manifesting themselves in an actaul human form. I know, that sound weird, but the shadow swapping leads to some really cool ideas when it comes to the puzzle sections. You will occasionally have to think while moving objects in the third dimension in order to create and modify shadows in the second dimension in order to reach new areas. It can be tricky at times yet feels very satisfying when you succeed at some of the trickier puzzles.\n\nYet, at the end of the day, the time I spent with the lovely lady was short lived. 2.9 hours on record is a bummer considering I actually went out of my way to collect as many of the hidden collectibles as I could find and still beat the game short of 3 hours. The world is very interesting, the gameplay is challenging (despite the controls feeling a little off) and the story is realistic and a little troubling, but in a good way. At the end of the day, I would recommend her to anyone who likes puzzle platformers, just be sure treat her the same was I did, or she's not worth your time.","February 10, 2015","true","2.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","3"

Puzzles may take some people a long time, but for the most part they were easy and entertaining (in my opinion). I would not buy Contrast for the base price, however at a discounted price, of course I would, no doubt.\n\nThe storyline is quite deep and a complete analysis of what's going on/has gone on/will happen will take forever because of the unexpected plot twists. Again, like some Indie games, the focus was on Dawn, the supporting character you play. Technically the main character is Didi as she is the one you're helping.\n\nI still have many questions and am quite frustrated because my questions cannot be answered. I would love to have some sort of a sequel of this pleasant Indie game which focusses more on Dawn and Dawn's predecessor (Aurora). I want to know more about the Shadow World and how it works, along with information about Didi's interactions, and why no one in the 'Shadow World' can interact with Dawn while she is a Shadow etc. But a good game, just like a good book. leaves the player with unanswered questions that you feel a burning need to get answered...\n\nI hope the new game that Compulsion is developing will focus on the Shadow World.

Manipulating light sources to move shadows around is intuitive and adds some complexity to the puzzles.  Transitioning in and out of shadow is fluid and also fits well with the rest of the platforming.  That being said, the clunky physics will frequently and unexpectedly push you out of shadows, often times due to a poorly designed obstacle location.\n\nThe highlight of the game is clearly its fantastic art design.  The surreal Parisian-noire tone is presented well, covering everything from the lighting to the architecture.  Once you've accustomed yourself to the art design however, there isn't much more to the game.  The story is charming but rather predictable, the environments are small and sparse, and the puzzles are short and straightforward (complicated only by the aforementioned shadow physics).  Most irritating for me were the constant fade-to-black mini-cutscenes, which take away control from the player and ruin the game's pacing.\n\nThe pop culture geek in me got a kick from the various movie easter eggs (Casablanca! Back to the Future! Fight Club!), but otherwise I was left disappointed.

The premise is neat - you control Dawn who can literally "shrink into the shadows." However, the execution is poor; the controls are clunky; the story is cliche; the writing is atrocious; and the voice acting is grating.\n\nThe game is broken (intentional pun) into three acts and tells the story of Didi who is the only one that sees Dawn. While you can shrink into the shadows, the lights only light up in the areas where there is a puzzle. Everywhere else, there are no shadows. Given some of the platform jumping needed for the puzzles, the controls are wonky. They are extremely loose and the camera wanders which makes the POV confusing. Sometimes you will do a puzzle and the camera is in one location. The next time (because you fell) it is located differently and can't be moved to a better location because it is stuck or something.\n\nThere are collectables in the game that are easy to collect. They are usually in your path and have blue sparkles swirling around them. In addition, there are several luminaires in the level. These are balls of lights that can be used to power equipment. These are spread through the level - some in your path (enough to finish the level) others in harder to reach areas. However, in many cases if you don't get them you can't get them later. In order to get full completion, you have to start over. I did this several times. Frustrating...\n\nThere are no people in the game, other than Didi. Key story points are told through shadow figures. (My wife saw Didi's mom and made a comment that she wouldn't be able to stand and likely would end up on her face she was so top heavy.) This is interesting enough, but the shadows clip through the environment. Along with the voice acting, I was pressing the "Y" button to skip them. Some special swirling items activate "special" shadow show puzzles to flesh out the story.\n\nIts not all bad. Some of the puzzles are clever. Act II is pretty neat. Didi needs to fix a circus for her dad. And as I said, the idea has potential, just poorly executed in my opinion. It is hard to recommend this game, especially at full price. Wait for a sale.

They\re quite stylish, '30-'40's style, but they're also a bit dark sometimes. As a result fine details aren't sometimes clear enough. Nothing gamebreaking but a bit disappointing. And while the game makes you think the world is open there's usually only one correct path to follow. You can run around a bit and try to collect orbs or collectibles, but it's nothing fancy. Where Contrast shines, however, is the fact that it allows the main character to use shadows in order to solve puzzles. It's unique and usually works quite well, but there were a few times where the game got glitchy, getting the character stuck in the environment or switching to your 3D form while still using these shadows.\n\nThere's also a story which is actually fine, just not very well realized. There's a connection with the little, physical girl but whenever there's a shadow conversation it's hard to connect with these characters, because they're just that; shadows.\n\nThe music is actually well done, with some nice jazzy tunes in it. The voice acting is also done extremely well for a game of this caliber.\n\nThe game ended after about 3 hours, which gave me mixed feelings. I kinda wished it was longer, but, you know, bigger and better. But because it's not I was actually glad it was over. It felt a little bit too gimmicky.

In Contrast, you play Dawn, the silent 'imaginary' friend of a young girl named Didi, whose mother is a cabaret singer. Throughout the game you help her solve puzzles and get past obstacles by using Dawn's ability to 'shadow walk' in 2.5 style platforming sequences.\n\nWhile the game is not a technical marvel, Contrast oozes atmosphere. Inspired by a 1920's vaudeville style, the game features impressive if somewhat linear levels. The choice to make almost all of the characters actually shadows of themselves thrown on to a wall Dawn is platforming across is a very nice touch that allows for almost all of the story to be explained while you're playing the game, so cutscenes are down to a minimum(in fact, there are only two or three actual 3d models of characters in the entire game, one of them being Dawn, the player character) while giving you something to pay attention to in cooperation with the gameplay.\n\nGameplay wise, Contrast is fun, but is hampered somewhat by glitches and clipping issues. Some parts can be aggravating simply because Dawn clips weirdly into a shadow or hits a part of a wall that randomly ejects her from her shadow persona, usually over a bottomless pit that resets you at the start of the current section. Despite this, the shadow puzzles are well thought out and interesting, and despite hearing a lot of complaints in the reviews on the camera, I found that the developers managed to make the camera do what the player wanted(many times I found the camera 'locked' to a certain axis, which made platformer easier and highlighted spots I should be focusing on). There are many times when Dawn got caught on pieces of the level, or clipped at the edge of a shadow and simply threw me back out again, failing the puzzle. However, these issues were minor enough that there were only one or two times I truly felt the game was entirely at fault.\n\nContrast's level design is pretty solid, though very linear, with the world well conceptualized to mix between shadow movements and 3d overworld sections, which serve to move you from one section to another. Occasionally I did find sections where it wasn't clear where I was supposed to go(In one, I had to resort to a walkthrough simply because the game's lighting hadn't highlited a jump point properly)\n\nThis is not a very long game, but I think I like that(the entire game and all collectibles took a few hours at best). Not every game has to be 60 hours of content. Like a movie, this game has a story to tell and it's good at pacing itself for that story without dragging. The best description I can give for the playthrough is 'comfy'. It's not particularly hard, but a few of the puzzles make you think. And that's really Contrast's largest failing, in that the game is relatively easy for these sorts of games. I think this is by design, as it feels like some things were made simpler for a younger audience. Collectibles are sprinkled directly in paths you'll be heading anyway, and simply add little flairs to the story exposition wouldn't be able too, so I have no complaint with them.\n\nAll in all, Contrast is a pretty decent buy for the price, though some leery of its short play time might want to consider wishlisting and waiting for a steam sale.\n\nPros\nNovel idea\nInteresting Style\nChildren-friendly gameplay\n\nCons\nOccasional glitch/clipping issues\nShort play time.\nNo replay value.","June 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Few games can be considered a visual and audio delight such as Contrast is. It is definitely not for everyone, not action packed or with potential cliffhangers but it’s by far a star.\n\nIt’s the result mix between the 20's- 30's atmosphere, the vintage representation of the decadent circus life, the dream shards of a Parisian street, and the film-noir instrumentals. It has clever and most importantly aesthetic puzzles, playing with memories and shadows.\n\nIt does however have its disappointments: few bugs and glitches that may at times annoy the player a bit. I also heard that people have problems playing the game itself because it freezes (it happened to me as well but only on short period of times) and crashes; and of course, the biggest problem of the game is that it’s too short. I would have adored to spend more hours of gameplay; not only that but because the game is too short we have to take the characters as they are, with few information about them and we have to adjust to the ‘momentary’ feeling of the plot.\n\nIn what concerned the characters and the story telling: it’s a great plus. Until the end it makes you wonder what is reality and what not, what is fantasy and what is science. You get to see all these interesting side characters and discover that, in truth, the story is about them.\n\nIt’s a game perfect to play during the evening and I encourage anyone with a bit of taste for the aesthetics to try it.","January 3, 2014","true","9.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

There is not much to say about that, it's simply beautiful, it really gets you in the 40s mood. Same goes for the soundtrack, amazing and enjoyable to listen.\n\nThe story is very original and complicated, but not too hard to understand (I'm looking at you, Bioshock Infinite). The characters aren't much "characterized", but they make their part good, thanks to the great voice acting. But there is a problem. Big problem. At least for me: Didi, the little girl that follow you around it's pretty tedious most of the time, and you have to deal with her for the whole game.\n\nGame's kinda short, only took me about 4 hours to finish, even tho I got stuck thinking in a bunch of parts.\n\nBut here's why this game sometimes gets really annoying: the controls are TERRIBLE. Just touch a key on your keyboard or move the analog stick on your controller and you'll see the protagonist flying away with a turbo speed; this makes her hard to control, and it's the main thing since it's a platform game. You'll find yourself make the same platforming stage over and over again for this as much as I did. This calls for ragequit or howls of rage. (btw I recommend you playing this game with a gamepad, or else you're gonna have a bad time).\n\nFinal Score: 6.5/10\n\nIt's a very nice game, enjoyed my time playing it, expecially for the sweet music. Got this game for 5€ with a sale, and I feel that's a great price for it, money well spend.","June 16, 2014","true","4.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Best to describe it as "inspiring" After finishing it you will feel like putting on a record of some old french chanson, grab "Mario and the Magician" by Thomas Mann and spend the rest of the evening reading and thinking about the lost world of circuses, magicians, and cabarets.\n\nIf you have the slighest doubt about the world shown in the trailers, or you find yourself not interested in the world of the 1920s cabaret-world at all then my advice is to stay away from this game. You will simply not enjoy it based only on the gameplay or story because it has it's flaws (quite a few unfortunately). I made a pros and cons list just to show it in detail.\n\nPros:\n- absolutely amazing, beautiful world. a true artistic masterpiece.\n- brilliant soundtrack, there are a very few games that come close in quality and execution.\n- great sound design (I'm talking about the fade-outs, reverbs and use of filters)\n- an interesting (but poorly executed) content.\n- tons of potential\n- interesting characters\n- puzzles requiring "out of the box" thinking.\n\nCons:\n- horrendous glitchy gameplay with a tons of bugs (rage inducing at times)\n- glitchy and shaky camera movement\n- unresponsive controls (I played with mouse+keyboard)\n- mediocre story\n- a small game world, invisible walls not really meant for exploring (except for a few collectibles)\n- relatively short game time (3-4 hours including collectibles)\n\nAs you can see I personally enjoyed my journey with "Contrast" but I'm sure it's not going to be a mainstream success.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/recommended/224460/","tejan","Tejan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/","450 products in account","For a 3D platformer the games controls are, to say the least, lackluster. There's a jump, a dash, and the ability to merge onto walls that have light on them. Aside, from these there's the ability to dash in the air and that's really it, unlike most other 3D platformers you don't really have a progression with more abilities added on or building on concepts. Luckily, it doesn't have the same issue as many other 3D platformers in that the camera doesn't fight against you a lot, though there are still moments of it.\nIf you like to go fast, the dash is slightly faster than the walking speed so you'll probably end up just spamming the button to move around (With the exception of going down slopes as the time it takes to fall after each dash on the slope is often longer than just walking down.).\n\nThe puzzles are often very easy, almost as if this game was designed for children. With the final level being an exception. In that chapter, instead of being too easy the puzzles are then made to be super vague and it seems like this portion was rushed as it lacks in polish compared to the rest of the game.\nAs a bit of a side note, I managed to bruteforce my way through most jumping puzzles by abusing the dash in the game (You can dash as you unmerge from a wall and this lead to dashing while merged on a wall then unmerging and dashing.)\n\nBy contrast, the story is very mature with a lot of talk about divorce, murder, and the like (Spoiler: There's even a scene where the little girl's mother attempts to kill her husband.). So that assures me that this game isn't meant for children.\n\nLike it's been said, this game can be 100% in a very short time. I beat the game with around 80% completion in about an hour and a half. It then took about another half hour to tie up the other achievements I missed. So you will not be getting a whole lot of time out of this game.\n\nI'd say there's one thing that makes this game fall short and that's it's lack of freedom and lack of replayability.\nNow let me explain what I mean by lack of freedom, the game feels like it might be an open world, or even Banjo Kazooie or Mario 64-esque hub world with stages, at first, but you soon realize it's a linear story with chapters and many many invisible walls. In the first area if you explore you can find the secret room with the donator names and I was hoping there would be more secrets like this as the game went on, but no that's the only really optional area in the game. Aside from that there are the lumes(?) spread around in the world and a completionist would want to go an collect those, but you only need about half of the lumes in a given area to proceed. This brings forth the question, why are there so many when you need so few?\nOnto the lack of replayability, the whole reason to play this game is for the story. The gameplay is decent, but what is going to keep people playing is the story of the game. Once you know the story there's no reason to come back to it.\nI was going to go back and try a speedrun of the game, but the amount of cutscenes and unskippable dialouge killed it for me. I'm certain there's plenty of ways to break the game, skip event triggers, and the like, but I don't want to put that much work into a game that, frankly, I don't like that much.","December 12, 2014","false","2.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

But it just... is not that good. The concept, the art style, jumping between to worlds seems amazing and in fact really is but on the other hand playing is totally frustrating sometimes.\n\nThing is you start this extremely weird looking game and be like "oh god this looks awesome" and after some time you discover that you can switch between 2 worlds and you go "that is AMAZING". But after that you really play it and it is just HORRIBLE. Every 5 minutes you get into the moment when you know what to do, how to get there but the game is somehow broken and you just cant do it. Massive bugs and awful checkpoint system make it a bad game.\n\nWhen you 10 times fall from the ledge and the girl tells you for 11th time to "hahah i know what to do..." and repeat that same monolog she already did 10 times.. you just wanna throw a brick in her face.\n\nContrast has looked sooo amazing at the store page so I've bought it in sale for like 5 € and I would really regret buying this game if it was at the full price. I have had to convince myself to give the game another shot to finish the story but it was for the purpose of finishing the game and not enjoying.

It's a noir-mystery that's filled with creativity, empowering messages, and gorgeous graphics. You play Dawn, a picturesque, fashionable, mute woman who can fade into the shadows, unseen by the colorful characters that walk among your partner in crime. You're there to aid Didi, a brave, optimistic, imaginative young girl trying to pick up the pieces her broken family leaves behind. The still life of everything around Didi and Dawn are metaphorical in that it makes the situation seem dark and bleak until you play through the puzzles and breathe life into everything.\n\nI would have had a problem with the length had the story not been executed as well as it was. The mechanics are unique and unlike anything I'd seen before and it seems like they've fixed all the glitches fans mentioned.

Contrast. Lets first get some things and negative points out of the way:\n\n\n\nThe game is very short. About 3-4 hours, 4-5 if you want to get all the collectibles.\n\nI bought it during a 75% off sale, thus i cant judge well if it would be worth the full price. I would advice to wait for a sale .. like 50%-75% off :D Do keep in mind.. this is only based my normal 1 euro = 1 hour of gametime, nothing else.\n\nThough it plays fine with a keyboard and mouse and has not a single problem while using those devices, as always i would advice playing a platformer with a controller. (Game has amazing controller support btw, even switching from keyboard to controller in the middle of a tutorial text, the line will change the keys the text redirects you to)\n\n\nNow the good things:\n\nThe music is amazing. The jazzy style with some sweet vocals now and then made me finish this game quicker then expected due to being able to play longer without getting bored.\n\nThe atmosphere in the game is the other big part. It feels as if you got trown back into the past.. back to the time of the blues, gangsters and burlesque. Alot of the game being darker colored with not that much massively bright colored objects make it an amazing experience.\n\nNow the platforming. When i started playing i felt trown back into another one of my favorite games in the past years.. Alice: Madness Returns. A 3D world from third-personview with platform elements while getting you further into the story in between. Even though Contrast doesnt hold any combat, the platforming parts are quite active... it doesnt just stop with moving platforms..nooooo.. because Contrast has something else.. shadows.\nYou are able to go into the light reflecting on walls etc. and go inside of your own shadow, allowing you to go alot further then just walking on physical objects. Combine this with being able to dash and be able to become a shadow even when mid-air makes for some exciting puzzles. Its not THAT hard but i can see some people taking their time at some puzzles for sure.\n\nThe story is great. Because your own personage stays on the background, you get fully emerged in the story of the child you are taking care of. Lets just say it has some nice twists and emotions (Not as emotional as Brothers: A tale of two sons (of which im not afraid to admit is the only game in history that literally made me shed a tear for a sec) with a good plot (though it might be slightly confusing for some ;D). I wont spoil anything of the story so enough about that!\n\n\n\nNow the conclusion. Great game, nice controls, gameplay and atmosphere feel amazing and suck you in. Not supermemorable game that will change your life entirely but still a very very well-made game.\nI would rate this game 7.5-8/10.\nNot sure if i would pay full price since im a cheapass :P but at least worth looking into and certainly worth buying with any discount.\n\nIts on 75% discount till 2 December (2014) btw.","November 29, 2014","true","5.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's based on a really interesting concept, is set in a cool environment with great art direction, and it has a killer soundtrack. It also has a fairly decent story (or at least the beginning of one).\n\nHowever, despite these things, much is left to be desired. Character animation and control is extremely stiff. Most times you'll know exactly what you need to do, but the game's temperamental controls will prevent you from actually accomplishing it. A major frustration was the game randomly deciding to pop the character out of the "shadow realm" for no apparent reason. Even running along an even surface sometimes resulted in the character popping out and falling either to her death or back to the beginning of a platforming section. Another frustration was the fact that, despite controlling a character who's supposed to be an agile acrobat, you often feel like you're controlling a much larger character who's invisible bounding-box is always bumping into things and preventing seemingly simple jumps from being accomplished.\n\nSadly, I have to go with "not recommended." It's just too short, and too glitchy. It seems like there's definitely a lot of potential for a really great game hidden underneath Contrast's annoyances. Hopefully, we'll see a sequel with these issues ironed out.","January 29, 2014","false","4.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Over the course of the game you’ll venture through places such as cabaret theaters, seedy taverns, decrepit carnivals, observatories, and shadowy alleyways, all of which invoke a feeling of wonder.

Didi wants to get her father back to her family and you have to help her. To do so, you have to fix some things and open the way where didi is not able to get through. The interresting thing here are the game mechanics. You have to move objects in front of lights sources to change the shadows on the walls. Then you can step into the walls so that you can move along these shadows. You have to take objects with you when you are a shadow on the wall, to bring them to the place where you need them. And so on. Thats quite unique and a pretty nice idea. It is really fun, to figure out which step you need to do next, to solve all these puzzles. BUT: I finished this game in about 3 hours with almost all the collectable items (I missed 2 Items somewhere) This is a bit short in my opinion and this is the reason why I would recommend, to buy this game if you can get it in a deal and not for the full price.

I feel as a player I want to know a bit of backstory when going on the big quest but I guess I can't ask that when the game is supposed to be a big odd puzzle with shadows jumping around on buildings in love.\n\nBesides the story the gameplay is really original like no other game with the unique mechanic and odd puzzles that are very hard to solve from time to time, though I really wish the story would carry the game as much as the atmosphere does. With that said, if you want to have a hard time solving puzzles (atleast I think it's a challenge), and be in the spotlight from time to time as a lurking shadow in Paris among other awesome places jumping on everything you can jump on as well as shadows, then this game is for you! I would give it a 6/10 because of the game not being fitted for my need of a solid story, but if you don't care about the story balancing the gameplay that much then this game is a good choice!\n\n\n/Sow","January 2, 2014","true","9.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It's a platform-based puzzle game set in a surrealist, steampunk, early 20th century paris-like city. The player controls Dawn, the imaginary friend of the main character Didi, who has the titular power of being able to switch back and forth from the physical world to the shadow world. The player uses this ability to solve the many puzzles that are conviently wrapped around the story line. I don't want to delve too deep into the lore of this story, since most of its value comes from its twists (which is bad enough that I'm addressing), but it is something to witness. I wish that the game explored certain aspects that I felt needed developing, and the ending was a bit lackluster.\n\nI have two main quips about this game. The first is its glitches. Sometimes when doing certain puzzles in the shadow world, the game will inexplicably pop you back into the physical world. Puzzles like these just require trial and error, but in a game where the main goal is to challenge the player's smarts and not their patience, it has no place. The second quip I have is the length of the game. It only took me three and a half hours to finish this game, and I usually consider myself as someone who plays through games very slowly. Since I actually got this game as a gift from a very generous friend (thanks BOT Mathew :3), I'm not that mad about it. However, if you plan on buying this game, ONLY GET IT ON SALE. It is definetely not worth a full $15. Other than that, I love this game. The controls are great, the visuals are engaging, and the collectibles give an excuse to marvel at such a beautifull world.\n\nTL; DR: A very pretty game with an interesting story and even more interesting puzzles, yet can get a little buggy at times and is too much for its price considering its length. A must get game while its on sale. Can be considered one of those "art" games.\n\nOverall Score: 6.5-7","August 31, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","4"

You play as Dawn, the acrobat "imaginary friend" of a young girl named Didi. The game revolves around Dawn's ability to transform from a 3D person into a 2D shadow. As a shadow, you can maneuver along any other shadow, as if it were a normal platform. Puzzles generally involve manipulating light sources to create navigable shadows, and then platforming your way through those shadows to reach new areas. The story, without revealing much, is just OK. It involves Didi's lounge-singer mother, her loser father, and a mysterious magician named Vincenzo. There's nothing wrong with the story, but it's also nothing mind-blowing, for the most part. And that sort of sums up the game as a whole - merely adequate. The main gameplay hook of transforming into a shadow, while cool, just isn't enough to sustain a whole game in its own. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of neat segments and cool applications of the idea. But after a while, you'll start to get the feeling of "been there done that", only in a new location. Not to mention, most of the puzzles (such as they are) are very simple anyways, there's not all that much meat on the bone in terms of challenge or completely fresh ideas. I am not sure they even could have added anything more to improve the game. As I said, it's perfectly adequate as-is, and definitely doesn't overstay its welcome. I just have this nagging feeling that there were missed opportunities for additional puzzles or ways the shadow mechanic could have been used. Maybe that's unfair, but so be it. Despite all this, I actually did enjoy and have fun with the game overall. I just feel that maybe with a bit more development time, it could have been better. But what's here is definitely an interesting experience, and worth checking out if the atmosphere or shadow mechanic intrigues you, as it did for me. The entire experience lasts around 5 hours or so, so also keep that in mind when considering your purchase. I would say hold off for a sale, unless you really feel the need to check it out right away.\n\nMy only real complaints would be for technical issues. Specifically, the game lacks many of the customization settings one would expect in PC games, such as video options and the like. Personally, I had an issue with the lack of an option for x-axis inversion for the camera controls. And while there is still no solution patched directly in game (at least as of the time of this review), for the record, I wanted to note that the developers actually responded to my request within minutes and provided a configuration file fix that could be changed manually to implement that feature. While it wasn't the ideal solution, I really appreciated their responsiveness, as it allowed me to play the game the way I wanted. So kudos to the developers for that. Which reminds me - I definitely recommend a gamepad for this one.","November 26, 2013","true","5.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

When there is a  big sale   on, something around 75% off - still think twice. The The whole game is a series of disappointinng shortfalls. Here's my story explaning why:\n\nI noticed Contrast over a year ago and the concept of the game, coupled with what I saw on the trailers and in the screenshots, had me really wanting this game. The price though was a bit steep, so I only got it on sale recently. And I'm mighty glad I waited. Without further ado, here's what's wrong with the game.\n\nFirst of all, the story feels like scribbled down on a knee five minutes before the writers had a deadline to submit it. Nothing to keep the player interested, just a generic tale of a child and her parents don't quite form a perfect family. The characters, save the protagonist, are shallow, one-dimensional and there's little reason for anyone to form any sort of emotional bond with them. The only chance of livening up the plot  when the player discovers collectibles pertaining to Dawn and Vincenzo in the last act  is merely reduced to finding some collectibles and one scene just before the credits.\n\nSecondly, the gameplay is, to put it bluntly, rubbish. Platformers in the 90's offered better game mechanics. The fantasticly promising concept of manipulating lights and shifting between shadows and the 'real' world is there just so you can jump on some platforms and move one or two boxes around. Nothing else. And one more thing here: the player character gains some skills for no apparent reason and then hardly ever uses them.\n\nThe controls are simple but even there you can find an issue, as the shifting mechanism often has a mind of its own and Dawn gets thrown off the platforms without the fault on the side of the player.\n\nGraphics. To be fair, the game looks alright. Nothing remarkable though. The models are edgy, locations deserted for the most part (I'm talking here about items, not characters - the lack of the latter is just part of the game) but the overall feeling is positive. The atmosphere in the locations is nice, kind of gloomy and decadent at the same time.\n\nOn the other hand, the animations is where the game should deliver and fails completely. The protagonist is said to be an acrobat. Therefore, her moves should be fluent, graceful and light, which they only are when the character is walking slowly or standing still and I'm not convinced that this should be the case in an action game. The animations of Dawn interacting with objects or moving stuff, as well as thhe animations of all other characters feel terribly outdated.\n\nFinally, the music, where the game promises much but delivers little. Despite what you might think having seen the trailers, there is in fact very litle music in the game. Soundtrack activates only when the player apporaches a certain location. Truth be told, the best piece of music was the one in the main menu. Character voicing is just wrong, its highlight being Dawn, who simply says nothing throughout the entire game.\n\nFortunately, Contrast is a very short game, in jusr 4 hours I manged to obtain a 100% playthrough. I say fortunately because I could not bear any more of the feeling that there's a game that could have been brilliant and turned out mediocre.\nPros:\nGreat noir setting\nFairly good graphics\nSome nice music\nGreat protagonistCons:\nLight/shadow manipulation reduced to one power\nUninteresting, unoriginal storyline\nAll other characters except the protagonist\nVery short\nAnimations from 15 years ago\nGameplay from 20 years ago\nImprecise controls\nWasted potential everywhere\nA final note: the ending hints, rather obviously, at a sequel. Unless the developers do some serious work to deliver a more complete experience with a story and gameplay to match its lovely graphics style its going to be, at least for me, a flop. So a word to the producers: Please, please do it right, because I so want the concept to be given the game it deserves.","July 1, 2015","false","4.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/broken_mirror/recommended/224460/","broken_mirror","Broken Mirror","http://steamcommunity.com/id/broken_mirror/","131 products in account","Intro:\nWell I first noticed this game shortly after I started playing Bioshock Infinite. It cought my eye because of it's art style. After watching the trailers, I added this to my wishlist and purchased it during Winter Sale.\n\nWell I'm not sure how to rate this game. It's really well done in the visual and aural departments. The atmosphere really transports that 20s France feeling. But there are some things to be improved.\n\nGraphics:\nNot much to rant about. Maybe that's because im easy to plese with graphics, as long as they just fit together. But there are some glitches, especially on movable objects (crates and balls). The puddles on the streets look more like ice than water. That's because there is no added effect if you walk through them.\n\nAudio:\nAlso nothing to really complain. The music is well done and fits the scenery. I really like the track that runs during the menu screen. The voice acting is okay except for Didi. Her lines just sound "strange" every now and then.\n\nControls:\nMy main complaint. It just feels like one of those early cheap 3D games. I often had problems judging how far I could jump. It just doesn't feel right. But I got used to it after a while.\n\nGameplay:\nYou spend a lot of time shifting into the shadows to acomplish your tasks. Sometimes the engine seems to have problems if the surface you are moving on is not even. If there is a corner, that's also a problem sometimes. But at least once the game forces you to go around a corner (which is evenly lit), so it cannot be intentional that the game throws you out of the shadow realm.\n\nSometimes there are new things to consider when solving puzzles. Unlike in many other games you are not shown that those concepts are there. Like shifting certain objects with you or moving objects using spotlights. I'm not really sure if this is a good thing or not. But I really liked finding those things out by myself. Maybe some optional hints would solve this "problem" for both sides.\n\nStory:\nTo make it short: No epicness, no world rescue, no over the top characters, no "only he/she can do it". But nothing that special either... but as there hasn't been a story one could call "groundbreaking" or "has never been done before" in the recent past, I really like that simplicity.\n\nConclusion:\nAn artistically nice game with a few control hiccups that doesn't do handholding and is solvable without the use of walkthroughs or FAQs. Tells a down to earth fantasy story without uneccesary epicness. Buy it if you like artistically interesting games that don't neccessarily appeal to the masses.\n\nEDIT:\nWhat I really forgot:\nIt would've been nice if there was some more interaction with Didi. She often just stands there and does nothing. It only was about two times that she assisted you in one way or the other. For example: the screenshot where she lights the way with a lamp? Never happened.","January 12, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Contrast also has a beautifully crafted film noir style 1920s world which is beyond beautiful and the soundtrack simply fits perfectly with the game and setting. The music captures 1920s cabart jazz and includes original tracks from Laura Ellis. Indeed checking out Cissie Redgwicks - Gimme That Swing (was used in the game trailer) is worth you time.\n\nThe story features a little girl called Didi and you play the role of her dimesion hopping imaginery friend called Dawn. However as Dawn you can only see the shadows and voices of the people Didi interacts with. But you will also see an adult world through the eyes of Didi as she tries to understand grown-up problems and tries desperately to get her parents back together. You will need to slip in and out of the shadows to complete objectives and you will often find the need to move light sources such as stage lamps or three-dimensional objects to cast the shadows, which Dawn can then navigate in 2D and progress with Didi. Controls are simple and intuitive and dying does not impose any penalties, (I played with 360 controller) experimentation is encouraged.\n\nDefinately worth the asking price.

Beautifully designed, this is an excellent showcase of developer talent and I hope to see more from Compulsion Games.\n\nContrast follows Dawn, a mysterious woman with the ability to meld into shadows, as she accompanies Didi, a bright young girl who won't give up, on an adventure through the abstract and shadowy reflection of the 1920s. The game itself is short, I completed it in 5 hours but many of you might take less time. As with any game with a similar length, one can't talk about the plot without giving anything away and playing the game for any amount of time will plunge you straight in.\n\nThe main mechanic of this puzzle platformer is the ability to shift into two dimensions and move along the shadows as though they are solid objects. Perspective puzzles are a favorite of this game, as are weighing down switches with boxes. Admittedly the controls, while mostly solid, are sometimes fickle. One puzzle towards the end took me much longer than the others; not because it was hard to figure out but because it was difficult to wrestle the object into place. one aspect of the game I felt could be done better is the collection of Iluminaries, objects used to power the machines in the game. while there are a surplus of them in each level, the game has a nasty habit of locking doors behind you. So in theory, if you failed to collect enough of these things when you had the chance then progression becomes impossible; though this was not the case for me, be sure to follow your instincts and deal with the main objective last.\n\nAt the end of the day I think this game has a lot of ambition behind it and, despite a few hiccups here and there, was very tight and well designed. The game does feel a little bare bones but as with the hiccups I'm expecting that the next game by the Compulsion will solve these issues. I can definitely recommend this game and others from this up and coming developer.","January 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Is a bad game? No.  If you like light (no pun intended) puzzle games with an Ok narrative an good music and art direction you are going to enjoy this. Is short, the mechanics are pretty clear aside of one puzzle, with an easy solution if you just ignore what the game is teaching you up to that moment  (what is doing is introducing a new mechanic), but is nothing really horrible in the grand scheme of things, the collectibles are pretty easy to spot (some are tied to the story of the game wich is something that i really don´t like in games but in this case it kind of didn´t matter really much) and you are not gonna be heavily challenged by it.  If you are not in that side of the playing field,  this game is not for you\nOn the other hand, when i finished i couldn´t shake the feeling that this game somehow loses the opportunitty of being something really special, because it has a lot of potential, puzzles could be more interesting and the story coud have  packed a lot more punch in the emotional side.

The general premise of the game, both story-wise (Didi and parents) and gimmick/mechanics-wise (using shadows to navigate and solve puzzles), was interesting enough for me to give the game a shot in the first place. I also enjoy the noir style and going back almost a century ago to a different type of world.\n\nHowever, the game really let me down. There's just too many issues that all stack up against it, and the quality of the game seems to bounce back and forth as you play. The story starts off without much information, though I did get into it once I started picking up what was happening. But there are a lot of weird background details that are never explained at all, and nothing much seems to fit together. I also did not think there was much of a climax, and the ending of the game felt very cheap.\n\nThere is no real environment to the game, as the world is weirdly disconnected and with missing areas and emptiness. Basically, there is no "life" to it, is a better phrasing. You just go through hollow areas to get to the next mini-cutscene, and then solve a puzzle. While the visual art style of the game great, and some places look very beautiful, the lack of anything actually inhabiting the areas ruins it. And though the game's gimmick, as I mentioned before, is dealing with shadows, I didn't enjoy every character except you and Didi being shown as shadows. It just felt cheap and as if the developers didn't want to do that design. It only furthers the lack of "life" in the game. And the dialog and sound of the game also was nothing special. Nobody gave any performance that was great, and I think a good few scenes actually lacked any good emotion.\n\nThen you have the mechanical problems, showing that the game wasn't fine-tuned or even tested that well. Your character's movement is pretty far from good, and I often found myself glitching around, especially when you are in the shadows. One of the things about the shadows is that if certain moving shadows are about you crush you, then the game pops you out of the shadows, which is understandable; however, I found myself popping out of the shadows at random points without anything touching me, causing me to fall down and making me start parts of puzzles over and over again.\n\nWhen it comes to Didi, who you are following around, they were very lazy in her movement as well. I would often see her animations entirely stop, so she would "walk" without any motion. She doesn't move her mouth when talking, at least as far as I saw. And half the time you were supposed to find her somewhere, I would walk into the room or area and see her in "generic 3D model" form, standing in place with arms and legs rigidly stretched out as if someone is in the middle of editing her design.\n\nAnd in terms of actually playing, it seemed like "Saving" didn't actually mean the game was saving, whenever it popped up. At least twice, I exited the game to stop playing after it had finished saving, and I came back each time to find that the game jumped back at least 10-15 minutes, so I would have to redo some section. For instance, it did this in one of the carnival areas after I completed it and then quit the game.\n\nFinally, the length of the game - it is way too short, and with all of the issues, it all made it even worse. I don't know if the developer just didn't have enough money at the time, or they just chose not to clean things up or test enough, but the game is very lacking in pretty much every area. It could have been a really great game if they had put in more work.","April 15","false","5.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The concept of the overall storyline is interesting with the main character, Dawn, jumping between a shadow world and a 3D world. However, the game mechanics are sloppy and sometimes so bugged that it can ruin the game. At one point, the little girl, was a static figure and simply slid across the screen for an entire Chapter. Other times, Dawn seemed to hit this invisible wall when doing different jumping puzzles, making some jumps almost impossible to do smoothly on a first run.\n\nThe puzzles themselves were interesting and sometimes frustrating - which is always good. However, they sometimes would get so buggy...\n\nMy other main issue with the game was the general graphics of the shadow people. They were exceptionally blocky and I felt that the developers had gotten really lazy. I could see seams on forearms and their mouths never moved even if they were deep in conversation. I felt like they were more like puppets than people.\n\nI also realized, after game completion, that there were significant plot holes surrounding some characters. I have no intention of spoilers, but it is really frustrating when a game feels incomplete in their storyline.\n\nFor the full price, it is not worth the four hours of gameplay. I highly recommend that you wait for a sale and buy it on a whim. I loved the concept, the voice acting (Jensen from Deus Ex anyone?), and the film noir style of both music and setting. However, between the bugs, the blocky animation, and the weak ending, I really felt cheated.","July 20, 2014","false","3.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The 3 hours of gameplay doesn't allow enough time for this idea to evolve. Most "puzzles" end up being nothing more than jump - shift - jump - shift. To make matters worse, platforming is a bit clunky. I felt like my character was alittle too big for the world. Missing an easy jump and falling to your death is infuriating, but the game is really forgiving, almost always reloading near the last jump. The main plot, although nothing more than a mellowdrama, hid behind it the more interesting subplot of the player's identity. This, sadly, is only hinted at in clues in the environment and pointless 'collectables'. Then the game ends, not really concluding anything, even the main plot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/recommended/224460/","RemyLabue","RemyLabue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemyLabue/","394 products in account","Contrast is a 3D puzzle\platformer that takes place in a world full of magic, cabaret singers, and burlesque shows. It utilizes a 1920's 'French Noir Film' art style that is unlike any other game I've played. The character design is beautiful, the voice acting is amazing, and the jazzy soundtrack fits the world perfectly. I can't stress enough how much I love the look and feel of this game. Yet, I can't recommend it, which is particularly disappointing considering how much there is to like here.\n\nYou play as Dawn, a woman trapped between the worlds of light and darkness, and who cannot be seen by anyone except for a little girl named Didi. Didi's parents have broken up, and with the father out of the picture, her mother works at a nightclub to pay the bills. This, of course, means nobody is watching the little demon-spawn and it's up to Dawn to keep her out of trouble. Easier said than done, since she insists on roaming around the city at all hours of the night, refusing to listen to reason, and all you can do is enable her.\n\nThe entire game revolves around a shift mechanic that allows you to become a shadow, an ability you will need to solve puzzles and progress through the game. Adjusting light sources to cast shadows to interact with is this game's bread and butter, and you'll be doing a lot of it.\n\nThe problems with Contrast start almost immediately. While the puzzle mechanics are unique and interesting, they are a bit buggy, and simple platforming can be difficult with controls that don't feel tight or responsive. Dawn has a tendency to get stuck in the environment and other shadows as well. There are even a couple of places where dropping an object in the wrong spot could result in the player not being able to progress further, forcing them to load the last checkpoint.\n\nOnce the game defines the parameters on the first couple of puzzles, it doesn't change them up much and they can become repetitive fast, which really shouldn't happen in a game this short. Which brings me to the biggest issue Contrast faces. The entire game can be completed in under 3 hours, and the ending is exceedingly abrupt. All of these issues combined leaves me with a feeling that the game is unfinished. Almost as if Compulsion Games ran out of money for the title half-way through development. Obviously, I do not have firsthand knowledge that this is the case, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm playing an Early Access game, and not a full release.\n\nAltogether, Contrast is a game that should have been a one-of-a-kind, beautiful experience. When a bad idea becomes a bad game, it's expected, but when something that starts off this amazing falls flat, it's all the more frustrating. I expected better, as did most gamers, and in the future I hope Compulsion learns from their mistakes, and releases games that shows us all what they're really capable of.","November 18, 2014","false","6.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But ultimately rewarding.\n\nThe pros?  Where to begin!  Absolutely top-rate storytelling (this could almost be a film), sometimes ingeniously clever puzzles (though none so hard that one just throws in the towel), gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound, and a genuine sense of child-like wonder which seamlessly blends with the harsher realities of the adult world.  Think Tomb Raider meets Limbo (that is to say, both 3D and 2D platforming elements, effortlessly combined), with a story and direction worthy of Tim Burton (the earlier one, that one that made the good films before he became such a predictable hack).  Oh, and it's nowhere near as painfully LLLOOOOONNNGG as all games seem to feel the obligation to be these days (or in other words, it doesn't "overstay its welcome").\n\nNow the cons.  Some of the platforming elements are PAINFULLY pedantic...one teeny, tiny miscalculation in where you place a lighting rig (this game is all about shadows), and you could very well waste the next forty seconds running and jumping to a point just to realise you ain't gonna make that final jump.  And then it's ALL the way back to the start of the puzzle again.  And there's some reflex-based moments of timing which become frustrating thanks to the sometimes ill-responsive controls, though fortunately, these bits of the game are at least few and far between.\n\nHonestly, though, none of what I've just said would be all THAT much to grumble about, if it weren't for the POSITIVELY DIABOLICAL SAVE SYSTEM.  Why does nearly every modern game have to insist that if someone switches it on, they'd better be ready to sit there non-stop for HOURS?  Do they not know that some of us have JOBS?  LIVES?!  That we CAN'T necessarily invest two hours at a time into conquering A WHOLE FREAKING CHAPTER before switching off and going to bloody BED???\n\nBut as I said earlier...sigh...at least this is one recent game which doesn't feel the need to give us a non-linear plot full of extreme repetition, constant backtracking, and an "open world" which takes 180+ hours to explore.  Short, and on the whole, very sweet.  But man oh man, do these game designers EVER test their own games, or better yet...give them to NORMAL people to try out before commercial release?  It's a good thing I don't have a "life" to spend precious time on, or I'd just about give away this whole "gaming" lark altogether!\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","November 28, 2013","true","9.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Few days ago I finally decided to check it out and the game charmed me. It has really amazing cabaret/noir style atmoshpere and awesome matching music. Gameplay itself is pretty innovative too. You need to switch between 3D and 2D mode platformer. It is very interesting that in the 2D mode, you can move only on the "shadows" on the walls and flat objects. Shadows can be created by yourself through interaction with various objects in 3D mode. You need to use appropriate arrangement of their relation to one another and to light sources, so in the result you can move on them in the 2D mode.\n\nThe biggest downside is the length of the game - finishing it in almost 100% takes only 3-4h. Also, the "puzzles" are fairly simple. It's a pity that the authors failed to further develop the aforementioned theme, because the game had great potential.

Couple that with a jazzy nightlife setting, and you can't go wrong, right?\n\nUnfortunately that is not the case. The platforming was often really frustrating and the game was fairly buggy. I found a few places where I could melt with a wall or I would have to jump three or four times to make it onto a ledge that was well within reach.\n\nThe story was alright. You play as Dawn, the imaginary friend of a little girl named Didi. Didi's parents are separated and she sneaks out in the night on a regular basis to watch her mother sing at a club. Dawn helps Didi to progress past obstacles and fix things, and hopefully eventually to reunite her family. Dawn and Didi are the only ones who appear as three dimensional people in the world; everyone else appear as shadows on the walls, and are often parts of the platforming that the player has to perform.\n\nIn a lot of ways I am glad that the game only took three hours. I wish I could recommend Contrast because it has the makings of a cool, unique indie game. But it just wasn't made well at all. Don't buy it.","November 25, 2013","false","3.3"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

There are a lot of places where lack of testing shows. Some floors aren't solid and character falls through, some shadows look like useable, but aren't. In some places you can't get into without apparent reason,  there is just an invisible wall in front. Controlling character is difficult at times, unnecessary pauses after cutscenes when character can't move. Shifts into above-view scenes where controls aren't clear and sometimes reversed, too small tolerances for wrong moves in these situations. If you walk in wrong way while figuring out controls, you are shifted back to normal view with a long pause in between.\nAlt-Tab crashes the game 7/10 times... why? U3 engine does it so well in other games.\nHopefully these gets addressed, even if not in this game, perhaps in sequels or other products from authors.","December 25, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With more work, this could have been a great game.\n\nContrast is a game with a novel mechanic: the player moves between a 3D normal world and a 2D "shadow world" to solve platform puzzles. It makes for some really challenging puzzles, but unfortunately, this system can be buggy and unwieldy at times, making some of the puzzles much more difficult than necessary.\n\nThe game took me three hours to finish. It's not a long game, and I feel that is its biggest weakness. It lacks the depth of a truly immersive story. At the end of the game, I was left wanting more. More backstory. More plot. More explanation. More puzzles to solve. I feel like so much more could have been done with this game to give the player a really good story.\n\nThe story is set in a beautifully-crafted, dark, intriguing noir-20's/30's world with heavy steampunk accents. The level modeling and art are excellent, but the character modeling and voice acting leaves something to be desired. The actors are rather unpassionate and unconvincing.\n\nContrast is a fun little game, and I definitely recommend it.

As soon as the first title screen comes up and you hear the stylings of 1920's blues, you know you're in for something different. Contrast takes place in an atmospheric France, 1923. You're a mute acrobat that can merge with shadows and you're followed by a little girl named Didi. Didi is the star of the game, her perfectly casted voice actor and her adorable lines will have you thinking "Who the hell is Ellie?". The noir aesthetic is reminiscent of Dishonored meets Bioshock meets Boardwalk Empire. The acting, story and scenery feel authentic to the era. The gameplay is perfectly simple, though the puzzle aren't much of a challenge. The past three years have been landmark years for the downloadble/indie game scene. The quality of absolutely great and relatively cheap titles rivals that of their AAA counterparts. Contrast is, without a doubt, a legend among it's peers; Bastion, Braid, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, Castle Crashers, Guacamelee, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, Journey, Magicka, Mega Man 9, rain, Shadow Complex, Skullgirls, Stacking, Super Meat Boy, Terraria, Torchlight II, Trine and more. In my opinion, the game tops most of those. There isn't much to say about the game's flaws. It's unfairly short; I collected every collectible, completed all of the achievements and still clocked in at 4 hours. A gem like this deserves to be a lengthened experience. Aside from the game's length, there is a clear lack of polish. Had Compulsion Games taking more time to test the game, we wouldn't have to be putting up with invisible walls or floors. While they weren't too frequent, they were uncomfortably noticable. At one point I left a building, turned around to go back into the open door and couldn't because of an invisible wall. I walked forward a bit and came back and was able to go back into the building. Though I am convinced these blemishes are related to an overbearing publisher wanting to rush their investment out,  small details like these and the game's length are the only thing that keep it from being a perfect game in my book. Anyone looking for a unique experience, pick Contrast up. It will definitely continue to go on sale, so do yourself a favor when you see it marked below it's normal price of $15.99. Games like this, from independent developers are on the rise, and as gamers it's up to us to support their new ideas in an effort to show the multi-million dollar publishers/developers that bigger isn't always better.

I haven't finished the game because I get bored of puzzle games after a bit, but if you do find the time, you should be able to beat it in a couple of hours and walk away feeling relatively pleased.","December 26, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With more work, this could have been a great game.\n\nContrast is a game with a novel mechanic: the player moves between a 3D normal world and a 2D "shadow world" to solve platform puzzles. It makes for some really challenging puzzles, but unfortunately, this system can be buggy and unwieldy at times, making some of the puzzles much more difficult than necessary.\n\nThe game took me three hours to finish. It's not a long game, and I feel that is its biggest weakness. It lacks the depth of a truly immersive story. At the end of the game, I was left wanting more. More backstory. More plot. More explanation. More puzzles to solve. I feel like so much more could have been done with this game to give the player a really good story.\n\nThe story is set in a beautifully-crafted, dark, intriguing noir-20's/30's world with heavy steampunk accents. The level modeling and art are excellent, but the character modeling and voice acting leaves something to be desired. The actors are rather unpassionate and unconvincing.\n\nContrast is a fun little game, and I definitely recommend it.

Challenging puzzles. 1920s noir ambiance. A bit of carnival, a bit of burlesque. This game is full of art, music and beauty. There is no daylight – only streetlights that bathe the cobblestone streets and alleyways. You are in a dreamlike world. Straddling the physical world and the shadow world, you must use various light sources to carve your path in the shadows to the other side. Though all but two characters are mere shadows upon the walls, their voices echoing around you, the game manages to pull together an interesting and captivating story… a story that becomes an adventure for you, Dawn, and Didi - the only one who can see you. Didi wants her family back together, and you are here to aid her using your unique abilities.\n\nAt times, the gameplay mechanics are frustrating and glitchy. But overall, the game is challenging without being impossible. The puzzles are creative and clever, and they carry the shadow play throughout the entire game and encourage you to use it intelligently to either continue on your path or obtain necessary elements or optional collectibles. The immersion is consistent and flawless - you do not leave the world the developers have created until you quit the game. And even then, you may find yourself humming the theme song...\n\nThough it will only take you a handful of hours to finish, it would be well worth your while to give this puzzle-platformer a try. This game has heart.","June 28, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, when I read that this one was set in that era and influenced by vaudeville, I immediately picked it up. In Contrast, you play as acrobat Dawn who is helping a young girl fix a series of problems in order to save her family. Throughout the game you visit a jazz club, circus, magic act and a few other fun locations to work through.\n\nThe atmosphere, world building, and overarching plot of this game are fantastic. It left me hoping that we'll get a sequel since I would love to be able to explore more of the shadow dimension.\n\nThis is a pretty short game (took me about 5 hours to complete the whole thing), but well worth a play through.

The game has a solid 1920s feel complete with gangsters and big show biz. For some of the main story puzzles that are timed (you have to finish it before another character does something), you can find out some interesting alternate-ending-esque information by letting time run out. The 2D/3D puzzles were my big attraction to the game. I think the concept is really great and the dynamic manipulation of the 2D landscape using light is pretty terrific, but a little buggy. It's unfortunately easy to fall out of the 2D world, particularly when dashing over anything slopped, and bumps in the wall itself can create unexpected shadows that'll knock you out into the 3D if you walk into them. I could see all these things easily being fixed in a sequel with better collision detection and a little more optimization of the 2D world. No unexpected weirdness was encountered in the 3D.","November 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are points where you can freely manipulate the shadows in the world as you desire, which allows you to be creative in how you solve the puzzles.  THe voice acting is above-average, especially for Didi, and the character design is allows you to quickly relate to the main family.  The plot iself only really kicks up at the very end, but even so, the twist ending makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside after you've become so attached to each character.\n\nThere was a lot of love put into this game, and it shines through (pun intended).

It's just... it's great. It's beautiful, it's creative, and it's lovely.\n\nI was asked if the puzzles got repetitive, because most of them are "move box to thing." And that is true, but the game was only a few hours long. If it went on much longer, I feel like it would have gotten repetitive, but as it was, it was the perfect length to not get boring.\n\nThere were a few puzzles that were kind of dumb, where I felt like I was kind of cheating by doing it the way I was, because I couldn't figure out what it wanted me to do. None of them were really frustrating, and the one time that I looked up how to do something, it was simply because I overlooked it.\n\nI'm all about collectables, so it was really jarring for me to collect something, which was something like the 15th out of 20, when the previous one I had was maybe the 8th. Then later, as I progressed, suddenly I got those bits. It looked as if I had forgotten them, and the way they were ordered for the second half of the game made me constantly question if I got everything.\n\nThere were also a few occational blips in the graphics, where it suddenly felt like an early Playstation game with how things moved or reacted, and I caught a couple T-poses if I got caught on something. Certainly nothing game-breaking though - just took me a step back from the magic. Sometimes shifting into the shadows would be aggrivating as well, and it just... wouldn't. I would do it again and again and suddenly it would work, and then it wouldn't do it again when I wanted it to. Frustrating, but nothing worth quitting it over\n\nDispite these things, the game is lovely. The art is lovely. The world is lovely. I wish that there was more going on, a sequal in the same space, or something. Maybe a second episode. I want more of this world and this cool ability, but maybe with a different puzzle designer. I would totally reccomend buying it if it's on sale, that's for sure. It's absolutely worth the few bucks. Ful price, ehhhhh.

The beginning felt really nice, with beautiful visual art and design. As you get introduced to the concept of a shadow world and switching between realms the game seems even more great and interesting. This is only emphasized by a cool soundtrack that fits the visuals. However, then comes the mediocre story that gets you running from place to place behind a little girl, making the game very linear. But later I realised this is not that bad. Because the design of the short levels is, while pretty, very unpolished. Glitches and weird camera placement is what took a lot from the experience and made the game frustrating sometimes. You see, the game is easy, casual even. It is just the design problems that make it hard.

This game is rather mature and deals with many adult situations from day to day life. Set in a noir mid 1900's city, the ambient is that of night clubs, bars and cabarets. Most of the story events are told through the silhouettes of the secondary characters sometimes having the player be prompted to intervene.\n\nAll gameplay revolves around Dawns abilities. In shadow form she moves on a 2D plane where she can reach difficult locations and resolve puzzles, like taking a heavy object from the ground to a higher location made possible via the 2D shadows. Very rarely is the objective or next point of interest not made clear, but deviating from the path has it's own reward on finding more story elements, like memories of past events and collectables.\n\nSound is a positive, each location has its own themes and sound effects that plays really well with the way the narrative unfolds, considering that most the story is told via silhouettes the sound becomes rather important. Voice acting is pretty solid and old timey that fits the time period.\n\nThe game does end with a sort sequel bating, and unanswered questions, one of which is made right at the end of the game, which for me is a negative but not so much that I couldn't recommend this game.\n\nIf you like perspective puzzle platformers, early 20th century noir visuals and a bit of drama, I can recommend this game. It's not the most original game out there, but what it does it does well and certainly has its more charming moments that stick with you.","June 8, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cute only because of the secondary main character and her naivity.\n\nAs a 3D platformer, it is very short, but boasts a wonderful art style that is also creepy in a Tim Burton kind of way.\n\nYou play as Dawn, an 'imaginary' friend to Didi, the daughter of Kat and Vincenzo. Didi's adoptive father is actually this guy named Johnny who's trying to make a name for himself. The overall story has overtones of mafia involvement, magic, illuisions, etc. It has a very early 1900's feel to it but the world is so surreal with the city that the game takes place being on floating islands. And the clockwork systems and other stuff.\n\nThe standout element is the ability to shift from the real world to the shadow world, similar to, I think it's Paper Mario where he can stick and travel on the walls. Or one of the Legend of Zelda's where Link actually does transform into a shadow of sorts. Well, it's like that. Dawn has that ability basically.\n\nI guess my only complaints would be the lack of ambient sounds and the length of the game. Otherwise, pretty good.\n\n7.5/10","June 20, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is set sometime in the 1920s and takes place in a wonderfully crafted and stylistically consistent world that looks like a mix between reality and dream.\n\nYou as player take on the role of Dawn, who is not only invisible to everyone but Didi, but can also shift between the 3-dimensional realm of reality and the 2-dimensional plane of shadows, where ever there is a bright light on any large enough surface. The feature is well-implemented, and most of the puzzles are cleverly built around this feature; the way it forces  the player to view things and think about them differently reminded me of Portal 1 and 2 - in a good way.\n\nThe story, surprisingly, is far from being a fairy tale for children as there are some very dark tones to it.

Both gameplay and story work well together, and neither falls short.\n\nSpeaking of short, the only short thing about the game is the time it takes to complete the story; for me, this was less than four hours. This is not to say the game is too short, however, as I found it to be just the right duration for the story to unfold.

When you see the trailers and read about it your in awe of an act where you can influence the stage. An act by the great Vincenzo, a casted illusion of a large scape platform game. The game is horridly too linear, pretty straight foward you just need like 4 lumis and the game progresses for a short time before suddenly coming to the ending. I was saddened as I was expecting more depth, more platforms and more plot. The game is visually appealing and did have an amazing idea,just failed to execute on it unfortunately. If your looking for a good long enjoyable game I would reconmend not buying, its not even worth its discounted price(and I bought the Collector Edition). I do hope the designers of this game understand the meaning of platformers,2d/3d, story and the most important thing gameplay, not Ideas cause thats all I saw and it went to waste along with my money.Good story and graphics though.","October 12, 2014","false","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/224460/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nContrast is one of those games that's unique and memorable at the same time, as it drags you into a shadow world in the 1920s Paris in the role of Dawn, young Didi's best friend who possesses the ability of shifting between the 3D material world and the 2D shadow world, making Contrast one of most ideas-filled titles of this year. Didi is also the only person who can see Dawn, but the actions you perform around the city will have an impact on the real world that is seen as shadows from Dawn's eyes as well. Even though Dawn is an interesting character on her own that you'd definitely become interested in as the game goes, this is the story of Didi's parents, who are constantly arguing after Didi's father left and her mother is too busy working at night, leaving her unattended - a perfect opportunity for her to sneak out and fix things around the city with Dawn's help. The bad thing about Contrast is that it will end too soon, rushing through the events of the story just to get to the ending, and even though following the plot is satisfying as it is, there are lots of moments that could've been detailed more, making the game longer and the lasting experience more satisfying in the end. Without doubt Contrast nails its presentation, having a simple menu that will almost instantly take you into the action, while still offering you plenty of options to manage things such as collectibles or taking a look over your stats. Starting with the purely astonishing art work and the detailed characters and moving on to the shadows that have an important role in the gameplay, but offer an incredible visual effect as well, the game is constantly reminding you how awesome its core idea truly is. The problem with that idea however is that it hasn't reached its full potential, as the moment when you get most comfortable with the control and the idea of the game is the same moment the game will reach its denouement. There are so many ideas that are simply rushed inside the game, such as walking up the shadows of Didi's parents in order to reach a location and listening to their speech while doing so; those are the kind of moments that make Contrast feel unique and make you desire more out of this game.\nRating: 9.5\n\nGameplay\nThe idea of shifting between the real 3D world and the world of shadows is without doubt one of the most unique and innovating ideas of this year and Contrast takes great advantage of this idea, creating some amazing puzzles that will leave you satisfied each time you complete one and move in to the next area, but the best thing about those puzzles is their deductibility, forcing you to analyse each one of them, but offering the solution if you stare at them long enough as it is sometimes more than obvious. Each new location you visit will introduce new puzzle concepts, some trickier than others, but same as the story those are rushed, never taking full advantage of their potential, as the game will quickly move from one concept to another, leaving abilities such as the shadow dash to be used only a few times in the entire game. There are the occasional glitches that will stop you from making a move in your first try, but there isn't any sort of time pressure on the gameplay so you have all the time in the world to find your way around a puzzle and reach your destination. The 3D world puzzles are enjoyable and the shadow puzzles even more, but the real magic begins when the game combines those elements to create some amazing areas that you will have to scout first, try different approaches and only then decide on a final solution that will take you to your destination, but all this time spent looking around an area is well spent as you will constantly be excited about where one thing should go or how the positioning of some objects will help you reach a higher point. Walking up the shadows of Didi's parents is an amazing concept as you get to listen to a part of the story while you're slowly making your way to a location that's related to that story, constantly keeping you on the edge about what's gonna happen next as you climb higher and higher and eventually reach a location that will unlock further mysteries. There is a lot of great stuff in here and because it is so great it leaves you with a thirst for more and unfortunately there isn't anything else.\nRating: 8.5\n\nGraphics\nContrast on the PlayStation 4 looks amazing, making the city of Paris come to life at night with the use of those same shadows that make the gameplay so enjoyable, as the little bit of light that is available in an area will reflect objects in the precise direction, something that affects the gameplay as well as the overall beauty of this title. Even if you only get to see Dawn and Didi as full characters, as the rest of the cast is seen as shadows, they are both incredibly detailed and fit into the world perfectly. The visual effects are okay, with a few things that could use some work, but what is really impressive is the reflection of certain things on the pavement of the street as it is wet and seeing that no matter where you go is impressive.\nRating: 9\n\nAudio\nThe voice acting is top notch, as the entire cast including Didi, her parents and Vincenzo take advantage of some amazing voice work that truly helps sell the story and the emotional road it takes once you get to know Didi better. The sound effects are just as good, making the world come to life and give Dawn's powers a great background; the best thing however, comes in the soundtrack, as from the start of the game you will be greeted with a noire classic, a perfect fit for the city of Paris in the early '20s, and the list goes on and on as you progress through the game.\nRating: 10\n\nExtras\nUnfortunately, the main campaign is the only thing that the game provides and that will be over in less than 6 hours, depending on how much time you take to solve each puzzle, and even though the game has collectibles you can find those easily in your first playthrough if you just look around, so unless you wanna replay the game a few weeks after just to relive the awesomeness, there isn't anything else to keep you around.\nRating: 4\n\nVerdict\nContrast is one of the best experiences you can have this year, not only because it is unique, but because it works wonders, providing some great puzzles, amazing exploration and a story worth hearing, unfortunately that will only last a few hours, so if you were looking for something to keep you around your PS4 a lot more, this will come as a disappointment, but either way Contrast is a game worth playing at some point, even if it isn't your priority for the new console.\nRating: 8.2\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Contrast at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=330","April 10, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atruejedi/recommended/224460/","atruejedi","Jamison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atruejedi/","364 products in account","Disclaimer: I have mostly good things to say about Contrast, but the lack of polish on this game makes it so I simply cannot recommend it, no matter how much I wish I could. A post-release patch could easily fix all the issues I describe below, but two years after release and these are still problems; hence, thumbs down, albeit reluctantly. I was tempted to grab this game when it was first released, but I'm glad I waited. I completed the game in about 3.5 hours, so do the math and figure out what amount of money you'd be willing to pay. I would instead recommend a game like Papo & Yo, which also centers around a child with family issues and is of similar length with equally unique but different qualities. So, without further ado:\n\nContrast is a platformer where you shift between the 3D "real world" and the 2D "shadow world" to solve puzzles. The controls are clunky/sloppy and you cannot remap your keys. This game was released in 2013 and the player can't remap keybinds? Hell, keybind remapping should be required; it's nearly an industry standard, and Contrast loses big points for lacking this "feature." This issue, combined with the dreadful controls, made it extremely frustrating at times. Near the end of the game, I died about a dozen consecutive times trying to jump a small gap. Was it my fault? I can't imagine so. I was very close to rage-quitting, but I knew I was in the home stretch. Fortunately, dying is pretty painless in Contrast, as you just respawn at some predetermined location in the game-world, and quickly at that... but even then, the developers barely put any thought into it. Sometimes to complete a puzzle it's easier to just jump into a pit than go back the way you came! I felt like I cheated during a few portions of the game, but considering how frustrated I was with the game by those points, I didn't mind. Ugh.\n\nBy Act III I just wanted to get it over with... but not because I didn't enjoy the characters, visuals, style, noire atmosphere, or music, all of which are excellent (especially the songs performed by Laura Ellis on vocals!). The story is good as well, but nothing to rave about. Gameplay just became a chore, partially because there's zero hand-holding in the game. Now, I'm not saying I needed hints to complete the puzzles; honestly, they're all pretty easy. But near the end of the game, I assumed the puzzle I was completing had to be much harder than it really was... so I spent about 15 minutes trying to move spotlights to solve this imagined quandry when all I actually had to do was jump up a ledge I didn't know I could jump up. Oh, and one time I screwed up a puzzle and had to restart from my last save... but since you can't save manually and the game doesn't tell you when it auto-saves, it made me replay a chunk of the game. Sigh. Come on.\n\nOne final nit-pick that really irks me: in Act II of III, there's a carosel puzzle, and once you complete it you can retrieve an item on top of the building... but if you don't grab the item when you're up there, you cannot go back and retrieve it, ever. I realize it's a small issue, but man... combining that with the lack of remapping and no real saving function and it's just too much. The developers could have created a wonderful experience for the player, but with the previous issues and the awful controls, Contrast is simply a shadow of what it could have been.\n\n...get it?","September 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also, I'm in love with Dawn even thought not much is said about her.\nBUT (and here comes the ugly part) how could they develop her character when they couldn't even properly tell the whole game story? Let me be clear: the story has a beginning and an ending (which I adore because I hate when they leave you puzzled) but it's told in such a rush you won't really find yourself connected with anyone. This game is short (or better: it would be but as I'm gonna explain next, it will gain longevity thanks to all the times you're gonna uncontrollably fail).\nThere is something really wrong with the controls, I played with a controller and Dawn's movements were very uncomfortable. I tried using mouse and keyboard and it was kinda better but still, weird physics. It's not very reactive and considering you have to jump a lot and switch while rushing and jumping, that's a big no no for me.\nIt got on my nerves, I fell so many times and had to run back and forth so much that I almost threw away the controller.\nGotta be honest, I insulted Dawn so much that if she were real, she would have come find me and punch me.","March 10","false","15.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","2"

The morphing into shadows is a cool game mechanic  however too many times in the game is it easy to slip out of the shadows or something will knock you off. Sometimes jumping on to platform becomes tedious work, you end up concentrating on to getting on to one platform so much it takes away from the beauty of the game and its concept. I find myself fustrated  more often then not, and when I'm not I am a little bored. Plus after a while I did get annoyed that the child was consistently bossing me around.\n\nSPOILERS DOWN BELOW\n\nAs for the story, it's hardly there. So you're Dawn (the tall shadow girl) who is the companion of Didi (little girl) for whatever reason Didi and you are friends, or at least Dawn feels a sense of responsiblity towards Didi for unknown reasons. You sneak out at night to see her mother perform in Act 1. In Act II, it concentrates on helping Didi's father figure because its clear he owes the mob money and he is using a broken cicrus to get money to pay them back. Then in Act III, Didi's biological father is performing at the circus and Didi ends up following him to his workshop in hopes for some connection. Then in the final act you have to turn on the lighthouse to light up the stage where the biological father is performing.\n\nThen in the ending there's this big happy dysfunctional family scene where mother takes father figure back meanwhile biological father offers Didi a chance for them to connect too as family. Keep in mind through out the whole game Didi and Dawn are the only 3d people everyone else is a shadow on the wall. The biological dad morphs into a real person and places his hand on Didi's shoulder, she gasps exclaiming she thought Dawn was the only one capable of that. The last scene is the biological father thanking you (Dawn) for taking care of Didi.\n\nPrior to this point if you were looking through the collectables, its set up to make you think Didi is mentally ill and that we are playing as some imaginary friend or demon/fairy. So its an interesting twist because it does change your perspective on what the story is. Because we are never really given the whole story most of it is for the player to piece together and make decisions. And in the end, you don't know who Dawn is as a character, or whiy she has a relationship with Didi, you don't know why the biological father can morph in and out of shadows or while he knows Dawn, the question of why is everyone a shadow expect for Did is never really answered.\n\nThere is one collectable that is a old time picture of Didi being a shadow on a street of real people, which could suggest she's the true shadow person but then it goes into hay wire with what occurs in the game.\n\nIf you still want to play after reading this be my guest, I just feel that the take away from the game wasn't impactful enough to make my eariler fustrations worth the trouble.","May 24, 2014","false","6.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Because we are never really given the whole story most of it is for the player to piece together and make decisions. And in the end, you don't know who Dawn is as a character, or whiy she has a relationship with Didi, you don't know why the biological father can morph in and out of shadows or while he knows Dawn, the question of why is everyone a shadow expect for Did is never really answered.\n\nThere is one collectable that is a old time picture of Didi being a shadow on a street of real people, which could suggest she's the true shadow person but then it goes into hay wire with what occurs in the game.\n\nIf you still want to play after reading this be my guest, I just feel that the take away from the game wasn't impactful enough to make my eariler fustrations worth the trouble.","May 24, 2014","false","6.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFlyingDill/recommended/224460/","TheFlyingDill","Dille","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFlyingDill/","667 products in account","I was very disappointed with this game. I wouldn't say it's bad, but pretty much everything felt underwhelming or out of place. You would think that in a puzzle platformer the platforming would be really fleshed out and feel good, but in reality it's super clunky. Even the 2d bits once you enter the shadows feel bad and bugy. The dashing ability makes no sense. Why would the players character be able to do that. Maybe if it was just for platforming and mobility, but you are braking fences with that ability. It's just silly. Same goes for the players ability to carry big boxes like they are made of cardboard. As game mechanics they are fine, but they don't feel right in the games world.\nConsidering the length of the game I think it could have benefited form just flushing out the basic platforming and shadow stuff and leaving out all the other tiny mechanics. In my mind having a solid platformer with a shadow gimmick would be much better,  than a clunky platformer with a bunch of flimsy mechanics that are used only handful of moments in the game. Moving objects to manipulate shadows was very interesting, but again, it was used only two times in the game and wasn't all that sophisticated. It would be so cool if the game had a bigger emphasis on this aspect.\nThe story is nothing special either. It's very simplistic. I really didn't care about it. It was frustrating that the mystery of why only the players character and Didi have physical bodies is addressed only at the very end of the game.\nThe only positive aspect of the game is its aesthetic. The Art Deco/cabaret stile is relay cool. And some of the level design visually is very interesting. Though I was a bit disappointed that in a game about shadows the shadows them selves ware a bit ugly at places.\n\nIn conclusion - get it on sale if the screenshots look really tempting to you, but stay away if you want super tight gameplay.","November 6, 2014","false","3.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The "interaction" is buggy as hell, and the screwy third-person view isn't particularly helpful either. My field of view actually clipped outside the wall in the wall at the start of the game because the room is way too small for such a zoomed-out camera.\nAlso, the game has random lag spikes at the worst possible times, and the graphics settings are extremely lacking in customizability. I could not get past a certain point in the game because it lagged literally EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING TIME that I tried to make a certain jump, and so I couldn't switch back to shadow mode in time, and fell to my death. Repeatedly, until I eventually gave up.\nAlso, the girl's dialouge is really really annoying and adds almost nothing to the story, especially when she keeps telling you the same lines over and over again. Honestly, this game was vastly diappointing and I very much regret buying it.\nThe really sad thing, though, is not my wasted money but wasted potential.

It bugs out constantly, leading to unfair deaths or do-overs. Some puzzles, like Vincenzo's workshop, are absolutely agonizing because of this.\n\nThe setting is nothing more than an idea: Cabaret. That's it. Nothing more.\n\nThe developers seemed to have desperately built everything in this game on those two ideas, turning them into nothing more than gimmicks. The story is nonsense--a mash-up of heart-felt cliches and sexist family drama the player will not care about, with random (--wrong--) references to Einstein and generic ideas of science floating in the background. I guess it's meant to add depth to the universe they're creating, but it doesn't help when a handful of the world-building collectables are called nothing more than "Science Drawing" and are literally just nonsense symbols and images.\n\nThe story also just gets in the way: I can't count the number of times I'd move a few feet and have control taken away from me, so the camera can do a stilted, early PS2-era swoop over the surroundings, complete with lots of janky start-stop moments. Speaking of, the controls--movement and camera--also feel like the platformers (e.g., MDK 2) of the early '00s.\n\nWhatever. Everything wrong with this game comes from its creation. It's clear the general ideas of the shadow mechanic and gimmicky cabaret setting were steps 1-10, and everything else was an afterthought.","September 5, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Unfortunately, the type of Contrast presented here appears to have rewritten the definition to fit its drab and dreary canvas. As if someone took the worst parts of the Psychonauts and completely desaturated the visuals, turning bleak a very uniquely bright and eclectic art style.\n\nContrast is filled with wasted potential and, from the get go, riddled with visual and mechanical glitches. The shadow mechanics are often inconsistent and ham-fisted, causing many a sigh of frustration. If I fail to react accordingly I will often be forced to sit through the same piece of dialogue, waiting for that small window of opportunity to open, only to be forced out of the shadows because I gently touched the wrong thing at the wrong time. I feel my character is too large and agile for such a small set piece, it becomes quite claustrophobic at times.\n\nMy main issue isn't the poorly implemented mechanics, but the lack of care I have for the characters within the story and the absence of any exposition that isn't told through the numerous collectibles found in the game. Thankfully Contrast is a very short game as it starts to overstay its welcome by the middle of the second chapter. How many puzzles must be solved by standing on the head of a person's shadow? I'd lost count.","August 10, 2015","false","5.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There is something else going on in the world than just convienent lighting, as other humans are invisible except for their shadows, only Dororthy can recognize the acrobat and their are strange anomalies in the world, such as a giant chasm of space seperating a road to a town cinema. Unfortunately, I didn't get far enough to see the end as I grew fustrated with the gameplay - so I will probably watch a playthrough. Thankfully, this game is nowhere near as pretentious as Papo y Yo.\n\nFrustrations\nThis is a floaty platformer, much like Trine or Limbo, though there were many times I either missed jumps or fell during platforming because the "Rush" move didn't work or over shot my jump. The game gives an impression of a simple indie platformer, and for the most part it is, but there were so many instant-death moments in the game that wore thin after the 20th time. I got to a point where I had to save "Fred the Knight" in a "shadow story telling" sequence and the game straight up crashed when the dragon's fire hit Fred. I'm not sure if it was supposed to Kill Fred or activate some sequence or cutscene, but the game immediately locked up my PC for a solid 15 seconds (I was sure to need a Hard reboot soon), then Windows came back up and shown that I was disconnected from Steam. Again, I don't know if that disconnect triggered some sort of glitch (maybe it was about to register an achievement, but I was offline and the game crashed),  but thanks to the irritating checkpoint system, the game took me back to the start of the level, requiring me to walk all the way back to the area and replay the entire sequence again. Mind you, there were two other story telling sequences I had to complete before then. Plus, earlier in the game, I got stuck in level geometry and had to restart from my last save. To my surprise, it damn near restarted the whole level and lost all my progress in the part of the circus that I was trying to repair. The death at the dragon was the final straw for me and I lost all interest in playing this.\n\nConclusionI'm sure other, less demanding gamers can get enjoyment out of this, and honestly, I want to see more of the story, so I will watch the remainder on Youtube. Unless you absolutely adore what is going on here, I suggest you do the same. Value your time and money. I bought this on a deep discount for $3.74, but I could have done without doing so.","November 4, 2014","false","1.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The voice acting is full of emotions in both the English and French translations of the game. The voice acting is well recorded and well cut. 5/5\n\nThe visuals in Contrast are some of the best to come out of Greenlight. This near unique art style really gives the game some flavor. Contrast has top quality visuals both in it's 3D, and 2D worlds. I have yet to encounter fuzzy or broken models/textures. 5/5\n\nThe story is brilliant and the execution is just as wonderful. Though many complain that the story is "too short" we need to remember that length does not dictate the quality of the story. Contrast's story is about bringing a broken family back together. The story has all elements of a story, a great intro, tense climax, and an interesting conclusion. Watching the world change as the story progresses is simply fantastic. 4.5/5\n\nMechanically, Contrast has a few issues- though the game does contain a brilliant feature where the character has to work through both 2D and 3D worlds, this proves to cause some of the major problems in the game. In the shadow(2D) world, the gameplay is relatively choppy- whether the character will execute commands correctly in this state is hit or miss. We can regularly see the character pop out of the shadow world for no apparent reason what so ever. This is not game breaking, but does cause some frustration when attempting more complex or multi-step puzzles. 3.5/5\n\nI believe that this game could also use some optimization with the keyboard/mouse. For me, it was a little tasking making the settings work with my hardware. This has no impact on the final rating.\n\nFinal rating – 18/20 or 90%   - I would suggest getting this game.","January 16, 2014","true","5.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","2"

The story follows a young girl named Didi, and so do we. We step into the shoes of a mysterious young woman called Dawn, who assists Didi on her quest to mend her broken home. The story is generally well executed and the art style and music help sell it beautifully. Steeped in early 20th century vaudeville aesthetics, the game's mood is warm and magical, but the over-the-top theatricality often seeps into the dialogue, at times causing it to come of as trite rather than impactful.\n\nThe main conceit of the game is that Dawn exists in a sort of parallel world, and her only connection to the real world are Didi, who seems to exists in both worlds, and the shadows. Dawn has the ability to literally become a shadow on the wall, and most of the gameplay revolves around using this mechanic to solve puzzles and execute jumping challenges. Shadows are also the only way in which Dawn can see people besides Didi, and the game's most inspired moments combine moments of shadow-puppet storytelling with actual gameplay. Unfortunately, these moments are far and few between, and most of the challenges are fairly mediocre, with the shadow-shift mechanic adding little but a bit of flavor. My biggest disappointment is how often the game interrupts the flow of gameplay with little cutscenes, sometimes wresting away control of your character simply to execute a camera pan and deliver a line from Didi.\n\nThe game shows great potential, but falls short in execution. Aside from the issues already discussed, there are the occasional technical issues, such as graphical glitches, erratic collision detection and at times wonky controls. A more rigorous synthesis of gameplay and storytelling could have elevated this game out of its mediocrity. However, its charming style and rare moments of inspiration make it worth a look should you find it for cheap (e.g. during on of Steam's many sales).","November 26, 2013","false","4.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

The gameplay is quite buggy. I'll admit, it has gotten better than it was the month after release, but I still feel like it could be better. Interacting with items is difficult to initiate and rather imprecise once you do, making some puzzles a bit more difficult, not to mention frustrating, than they otherwise would be. Another minorly infuriating aspect was the save system. You cannot manually save. The game saves automatically after solving certain puzzles or reaching a crucial plot point. The problem is, you never know which puzzles it saves after unless you're paying close attention to the corner of your screen. I was so fed up with having to do certain parts over that I abandoned the game for weeks at a time several times. All of that being said, I still truly enjoyed the game.

Considering this oversimplistic story, the game is overall boring, due to extremly easy and unchallenging puzzles. The gameplay time is barelly 5 hours long, but at least for me, that was mostly due to a very glitchy scenario and overall irresponse controls.

Instead, it tries to keep you in 3D (without the shadow puppet stuff) most of the time.\n\nThe intriguing part of the game, using the shadows to move around, seemed like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the main part of the gameplay seems to consist of moving lights or boxes to create those shadows where you want (without much in the way of real solving). The actual platforming across them, is only difficult by it being nearly broken. A lot of the time, I wasn't sure if I had glitched my way through, or solved the "puzzle". Really, the only puzzle is that you have to place the box so that it's shadow forms a super easy platform jump. This is made harder because the "targetting" system makes it hard to actual lock onto the object you want to carry. When there is any actual puzzle that isn't an immediate solve, it's only really difficult because of the trial and error of moving the light as well as shadow generators. But there isn't really any lateral thinking about it, just move a few things around.\n\nThe platforming, as a I mentioned is nearly trivial, made difficult only by the 3D controls being near broken, and the 2D having awkward physics (made worse by the fact that modern analog controls don't adapt well to it).\n\nWhen not in the shadows (which is most of the game) it is all the broken camera and awkward controls (made worse when the camera suddenly changes the perspective forcing a control direction correction) of poor late 90's platformers. You are always wasting time either because the controls messed you up and you need to recover, or because you need to keep running back to the objects to manipulate into position yet again.\n\nIt is a shame, because the moments when you are using shadows made by things other than your own dragging boxes around (such as a sequence early on where characters are having an animated conversation, movbing their limbs all over the place), it is a hell of a lot of fun. If the game had been entirely this, moving from shadow to shadow as the scene plays out around you, I would have really enjoyed it.","March 27, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is quite short which is fine, but for a puzzle platformer there are very few actual puzzle/platform sections. And some of these can be more frustrating than fun due to clumsy controls, poor guidance, or just long waits for cut scenes (especially in the shadow puppet/princess part).\nAlthough the game world looks quite nice it feels very empty (although maybe this is the point) and you have some freedom to wander around but there is nothing to do or see until you are forced to go to that area later in the game.\nWhile not a bad game per se, unless you are looking for a short indie platformer reminiscent of American McGee's Alice with an interesting mechanic poorly executed, I found it to be dull and tedious and you are better looking elsewhere.\nThere are far more enjoyable indie puzzle-platformers out there worth spending your money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feniz/recommended/224460/","Feniz","Sadface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feniz/","654 products in account","Maybe I'm just too quick to be critical of games, but sometimes you have to be in a world with hundreds of thousands of video games and lots of Triple A titles.\nFor me, Contrast is the type of game that delivers a game mechanic that promises to be innovative and amazing, but fails to really deliver where it matters - namely, being able to use shadows as though they were tangible things. You start off as an unnamed woman walking around in a little girl's bedroom, and it is quickly conveyed that all living creatures (with the exception of one special little girl) appear only as shadows and you are invisible to one-another.\n\nUnfortunately, after establishing that you are this little girl's friend (by way of picking up a drawing she made with you in it), that's all the reason you are given to follow her off on a boring adventure of interacting with objects, collecting objects, and being pestered to do things and go places in order to watch cutscenes. It really feels like it's being forced upon me when I don't even want to follow this little stranger and watch her parents fight; I want to explore the world and be given my own reason for doing things instead - not because a child tells me to.\nSo that was storytelling ruined within the first 5 minutes.\n\nThen there was the shadow mechanic - it seems cool in theory, but you end up using it to do very rudimentary platforming straight off the bat. Exciting stuff. Maybe throwing a few shadow balls would be nice, or knocking over a bottle, or knocking over a bottle's shadow using a ball's shadow! The first few minutes are where you really have to give OOMPH to this new mechanic, and sadly it's used only to run up shadow ramps (some of which are inaccessible until you have tagged along with your new friend so she can push a simple object for you and progress the story). Again - I'm feeling like this is off to a bad start. I hear the game eventually progresses to pushing boxes around, but manipulating an object to reach a high place is hardly an innovative improvement.\n\nAnd finally there's my last gripe - atmosphere. At one point within the first 5 minutes you also walk into a cabaret restaurant which is completely devoid of people and life. "BUT WAIT," you say, "people are invisible and appear as shadows!" Well yes, this is true, but there is nothing to make this restaurant feel LIVELY. There are glasses of alcohol on tables and cigars smouldering away in ashtrays, and there is ambient audience music playing, but there is nothing to make it feel ALIVE. No swaying and sliding of chairs, no sloshing of alcohol, no strange poltergeist-esque atmosphere replete with drinks trays floating around the room; bartenders shaking tumblers and pouring them out, no cats in alleyways knocking over trashcans and yowling, certain conversations that dim and fall as you wander the room - there is nothing - and that is where this game really falls flat on its face. You walk into a dead room and your only objective is to interact with the flashing objects scattered around the room so you can progress the plot because an invisible woman keeps nagging you to turn on the lights.\n\nI'm sorry, I wanted to like this game, but it took 5 minutes to convince me that I hated it - all because there was nothing to try and persuade me into staying a while, looking around and really enjoying myself.\n\nMaybe somebody somewhere else will do it better one day - because this game isn't there by a long shot.","January 17, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics and sound are excellent and the story is interesting, but the challenges are not over the top.

Shadows can sometimes be manipulated by moving light sources.  It's neat!\n• Story:  The story isn't masterfully told, but it is an interesting one, and I'm glad I stuck around to see it through to the end.\n• Art:  Contrast is beautiful to admire and its music is always a pleasant companion.\n• It's Indie!:  Support your local indie game developer!  Especially when they're doing awesome work like this!\n\nTHE BAD:\n• Game Feel:  As cool as traversing the shadows as a platformer is, Contrast has a tendency to be real finicky.  On some puzzles, I would get so frustrated falling out of the shadows, I would question if I was performing the task correctly; in every case, I was.  It becomes easy to slip out from the 2D world and fall to your death, and not even be sure why it happened.  I managed to finish every puzzle, but I would have had a lot more fun if the mechanics had been fine-tuned a bit more.\n• Acting:  The voice acting could've been a little more convincing, but--  Ehh!

If you run into something, or if you're crushed by something, you'll shift out of the walls and you'll have to try again or you just might die altogether. Not only that, but it's very easy to miss jumps when you're trying to jump over certain gaps (most are easy to scale, but there are a few that are just mind boggling). And there are also some puzzles in which you have to reach a platform in a small amount of time - and those kinds of challenges in games are always maddening.\n\nI'll play and I'll be mesmerized by the details and I'll want to find out what happens next in the story but then I reach a roadblock of a challenge and - after being pushed out of the walls, failing to jump over gaps and dying repeatedly - I get increasingly frustrated and then it's not about the story or the gameplay anymore, all the focus has shifted to that one piece that just doesn't seem to give if you don't get it just right. And after all is said and done and I can move on, I just can't relax and enjoy the game anymore and have to shut it off. A game is something that you should be able to enjoy and crave, but if it's frustrating - there's no point in trying; and that's a real shame.\n\nIt's a good game if you're a big fan of challenging puzzles; but if you're looking for a fun game with a sense of ease and flow, you might want to find something else to try.","July 10, 2014","false","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However i can appreciate it is the easiest way to achieve playability for Vol 1 of the concept of this game and quite possibly console gamers were the target audience. More camera control would have been nice (such as zooming with the mouse wheel) and i wish the game was a little longer.\n\nGame ambiance: 6/10\nThere isn't all that much sound going on around the character which does make the world feel a little empty.... or is it?\nThe visuals, lighting, area design, overall feel and style are enough to keep me well entertained. Set at night with a little dust here, some falling leaves there, limpid pools of sporadic puddles, fog around the corner, it's enchanting.\n\nReliability/Stability: 10/10\nThis game is based on the Unreal Engine and I've experience No problems with game stability. No CTD.\n\nStory/Plot: 7/10\nThe story was fun however maybe a little schizophrenic, at times i couldn't tell if it is aimed at kids or adults (maybe both?). Some parts seemed a little simple, then there are parts that could be questionable content for young ones (like violence and a recurring silhouette featuring some BIG boobs). Set in what seems to be a dream in the 1920's-1930's era, there are many enjoyable throwbacks to behold (jitter bug lolz). All in all the plot blends well with the concept and makes me wonder; is it all just a trip into the psyche of the main character, Dawn?\n\nConcept: 10/10\nThis is a great concept for a game. Right away you can tell the game creators think outside the box. It's great to see people expanding the possibilities of gaming and i hope it doesn't end here.\n\nConcept execution: 8/10\nFeaturing dynamic and changing gameplay this concept is a great introduction to what i hope will be a whole series of Contrast games. Given the challenge of creating something this different, and how the game production is creatively performed, it's hard to score this less than 8. I'm looking forward to buying Contrast 2.\n\nTextures: 7/10\nThe textures were a little simple in places and not all that detailed (compared to some other titles available), that being said it suited the atmosphere and visual styling of this game to a tee. I think any over done attempt at realism would have detracted from the fairy-tail style charm this game delivers in spades.\n\nModelling: 6/10\nI wish there was more detail to the characters. Yes, I understand that using low polygon objects gives better frames per second, and yes I understand that detailed modeling is challenging. That being said i felt as if they were just a little too low poly. I Don't want sacrifice the low res option; maybe add a selectable check box in game settings to increase the detail of the models.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nEasily enjoyable and pleasant to look at, this game oozes dream-time, misty-eyed scenery, that inspires the imagination. HDR is pretty in the Contrast world and given this is a game based on shadows... using it is a no-brainer.\n\nSound: 7/10\nThere aren't all that many sounds in this game although the sounds it does have are of a good quality. does it need more? Maybe, maybe not, but a little more ambiance would have been nice.\n\nMusic: 9/10\nTaste in music is subjective, personally i thought the music is great. A real treat for anyone new to the style, or into the genre. With good production and a light focus on environmental dynamics the music defiantly entertains and adds a very nice sense of immersion. I am thankful that the soundtrack accompanied the game on-disk as I can enjoy it at my leisure.\n\nAdjustable shadow mapping: No\nBonus/Extras: Soundtrack","June 29, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It only took me about 6 hours to finish the game with all achievements, so don't come looking for an exceptionally long playthrough. The story it tells is worth experiencing nonetheless.\n\nThe story follows a little girl named Didi and her mysteriously invisible friend Dawn, who you play. The girl's mother is a singer at one of the local clubs, giving Didi a chance to sneak out at night and try to learn more about her father, her family, and ultimately, the origin of Dawn. As Dawn, you have the special ability to enter the walls around you, walking atop shadows to help Didi during her strange and dream-like adventure.\n\nAs you can imagine, there are quite a few puzzles to keep you occupied, but not as many as I would have liked with such a fascinating concept. The music is fantastic, as is the stylized atmosphere, but what really ties things together are the story. Almost the entire story is told through the shadows and the things people leave behind, and they still manage to craft an interesting arch for it all. If I had to complain, though, harder puzzles would have really made this game a lot more fun, and the occasional frustrating glitches shaved off a point in my book.\n\nStill, for this kind of price tag, it's a crime not to pick it up.","July 13, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuholic/recommended/224460/","emuholic","emuholic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emuholic/","1742 products in account","Contrast is a puzzle platformer in a 1920’s themed setting, featuring a young girl named Didi and her friend Dawn.The game starts with Didi sneaking out of bed and into a nightclub where she finds that her family life is not quite as perfect as she hoped. You play as Didi’s mysterious friend Dawn, and must help with her journey to repair her broken family and get her parents back together.\n\nFrom the title screen, the scene is set wonderfully with a jazz soundtrack and noir design looks great. I have always loved the style in games such as Bioshock and the individual locations ooze of it, from jazz clubs, to cinemas and hotels, they all look the part.\n\nYour character, Dawn, can move between three-dimensional reality and into the shadows where the game becomes almost like a 2D platform game as she is limited by the shadows on the walls. Light sources create shadows and can found placed in areas to reach a platform that is too high to reach. So for example, if Dawn needed to get to an outside balcony in reality, she could enter the shadows, and now reach it by traversing shadows of a nearby café tables and chairs. that are on the wall.\n\nIt is a clever idea and on the whole it does work very well but I found that despite learning new abilities along the way such as being able to dash through shadows, the gameplay mechanics start to feel samey and predictable. It usually involves reaching an area which is inaccessible in reality, reach it in the shadows, and then activating a switch or cutscene to progress. One puzzle which stood out was the final level which involved some great use of lighting and platform/puzzle elements that offered a bit of thought. There were one or two occasions where I was not even sure I completed the puzzles as the developers intended, as it felt to me like I had taken a shortcut to completing what I imagined a more difficult puzzle.\n\nThe story is told well and without spoiling it, the game follows Didi’s mother and her troubles with her husband. The husband gets himself mixed up with the mob, and while his intentions are good, things do not go well for him and he lands himself in to more trouble the harder he tries to fix things. If you explore the world a little, you can find snippets of story which act as mini-puzzles while you listen and in ways interact with as you jump over the shadows of the characters or events.\n\nThe gameplay can be a little clunky at times. I was reviewing the PC version and played the game with both keyboard and controller. The controller felt very sensitive to small amounts of input and it occasionally made me fall off platforms or do something I did not want to do. The camera can occasionally give you trouble but it is free-aiming and can be fixed. The most annoying aspect is that I managed to get stuck in walls and scenery on a few occasions, with no option other than to restart from the last save position.\n\nThe length of the game should also be put into question. It took me just over three hours to complete the game which I found was very short. There are collectible items to find over the course of the game but you will find many of them on your first playthrough. There is little to keep you coming back after completing the game. I would have liked some more puzzles or side quests to add some lifespan and replayability.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the game a lot. The characters are likeable, especially Didi who reminds me of Clementine from The Walking Dead game. The story is interesting to watch unfold and interact with. But there was simply not enough puzzle content to get really stuck in to. It is worth pointing out that Contrast is free on PlayStation+ and in this case it is a must play. If you are a fan of the era or platform/puzzle games then you will enjoy the game, I would wait for a sale otherwise as it is a little too pricey.\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nClever use of reality 3D and shadowy 2D platform elements, but is let down by occasional clunky controls and finding yourself stuck in walls.\nGraphics - 8/10\nLovely 1920's noir style locations and design set the scene perfectly.\nSound - 8/10\nThe main theme tune is perfect for the game but there is not much else to listen to that is memorable. Character dialogue is done well.\nFinal Score - 7/10","November 27, 2013","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What looked like a fascinating premise in a fantasical world intermixed with an amazing sound selection turned out to be only one of those things. Being a shadow becomes very boring very quickly, as the puzzles all end up revolving around a convulted system of controls that will leave you very very frustrasted. You will be afraid to enter walls. You will be afraid of messing up a button press. And you will be very afraid when you realize this puzzle will just continue to drag on with more complicated situations that faulty controls will only make worst. The only puzzle game I can think of right now that followed the same tune as Contrast is Braid, and by Jove does Braid make this game look like a joke. In Braid you can rely on your platforming abilities to carry you through a series of increasing difficult puzzles, which will truly reward the player for their abilities to think intuitively as well as perform proper platforming practices. In Contrast, you will struggle about a world with frustrating controls, little variation in puzzles, and little reward from solving the them. Little reward as in you will not care at all about the story because your willful suspension of disbelief will begin right at the start. The game takes place in France, and it makes a point to say so. What it doesn't explain, unless I understood world history entirely incorrectly, is that the world is floating in a vacuum of space. No explanation ever. No explanation as to why Didi, the girl you are escorting most of the game, sees the pit once but never comments on it again, as well as no one else commenting on it. Hell, in my opinion, the characters stopping to talk about the fact they live in a void would be more interesting than any plot point presented in this game. The story is weak, from the first moment of blackmail to the ending scene. The ending won't make you feel anything. You will be annoyed by Didi. You will hate every character that pops their ugly mug in this game. So what do you have so far? A messy universe with messy controls, a cast of completely unlikable characters, a character that is a young annoying child most of the game (Trust me, Didi is no Clementine, and you will go back to hating video game children after playing this,) in a story that is riddled in plot holes and does nothing to keep you interested in it. Oh, but the music is pretty at parts. I think I heard some of it over my continued groans over having to do another jump dash puzzle that would randomly throw me out of the wall to my death.

Oh, but the music is pretty at parts. I think I heard some of it over my continued groans over having to do another jump dash puzzle that would randomly throw me out of the wall to my death.

The biggest challenges lie in the 2D platformers, whilst the 3D part feels underexploited (and the keyboard controls clunky - this was clearly designed for a controller). The 3D world just serves as an aid to model the 2D world, or as a link to reach the next 2D surface. At some moments, you feel like it's almost there and regret what the game could have become if the 2D and 3D had been made to blend in a bit more crazily.\n\nSome of the puzzles are brilliant, some of them just about mediocre, but it all ends too soon. The game is extremely short (only 3 levels, count about an hour each). WIth no extra difficulty or challenge, with all collectible lying out in plain sight of the linear path, the replay value relies on just one thing: the really compelling atmosphere, characters, and the excellent voice acting.","May 5, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Contrast is the differences seen when two sources of light come together. Similarly, Contrast (the game) blends its ligher and darker tones into a short, immersive experience with differences of quality that feel worthy of the price of admission, yet lacking in other ways.\n\nIf anything is holding Contrast back from feeling complete, it's not just the gameplay itself but also the technical issues and the final act.\n\nThis game will ultimately feel like it was two-thirds of the way done but never half-baked.\n\nDancing in the Dark\nContrast is by no means a difficult game. Your average playthrough, depending on how many collectibles you go for, will take you somewhere from two to four hours.\n\n(I would strongly recommend going for the luminaries as they use the shadow-swapping mechanic a lot, which is the main attraction for this game.)\n\nGames like these with a narrative focus are fine. Sometimes games with little to no challenge other than my wits are relaxing, which this game never struck me as being overly complicated.\n\nHowever, the inclusion of replay value would have been appreciated as well besides tying up the loose ends of the plot.\n\nIn Contrast, you play as an imaginary friend of the main character of the story, Didi. As you are a make-believe creation of hers, you are a surreal character to the mature events unfolding around you.\n\nThis also means you are given supernatural abilities: The ability to swap in and out of shadows and the real world, the acrobatic fitness to traverse the environments, and a few other abilities (a dash mechanic and  the ability to use light orbs). The main focus is always put on the shadow-swap mechanic, which I think is its best quality.\n\nYou aren't simply finding the well-lit areas to enter and leave new entrances. You are moving light-sources to shape the shadows on the environment, enlargening them and scaling them down, and you sometimes have to use the shadows' terrain to move real objects.\n\nSometimes the technical limitations rear themselves into this mechanic, such as when you are going around corners and you might teleport out of the wall because of not rotating the camera. Or when you enter a wall with the camera on the other side of the wall. For the most part, this mechanic is well-thoughout and only at some parts of the game feels buggy.\n\nUnfortunately, the other gameplay aspects either feeled tacked on simply because other platformers have them or they are there because of the game's light/dark theme.\n\nThe acrobatics shown on the first trailer on Steam are nowhere to be found in this game. (I watched it after I finished the game, and I felt that was worth mentioning because of how misleading they were.) I think the game could have benefited from more twitchy swapping sections lacking in the final game without making the game have a sudden difficulty spike. It would've also made the open-areas more expansive and well-worth finding the collectibles.\n\nThe luminaries only feel necessary when the plot demands it, and there are more than enough within the area you are locked in to never worry about finding any more. In the end, I felt these were pointless other than for achievement purposes.\n\nThe Shadows on the Walls Tell All\nThe one thing Contrast nails almost flawlessly is its narrative format told through gameplay. Although the game deviated from what my inital expectations were--of a subconscious friend being there to aid the protagonist--I still appreciate the manner of the story told that is not too dark for kids and not too forced for adults.\n\nDo not write this game off as another tale of the loss of innocence. That's not what the game is about; it's about seeing the adult world through a child's eyes with an imaginary friend.\n\nThe adult themes of vice, regrets, misfortunes and personal mistakes make the world intimidating while hiding away the faces and other details that would make things more clear.\n\nCharacters other than Didi and Dawn are represented by silohouettes with distinctive voices and models. The side-cast are executed well, and the implementation of their cutscenes as platforming "puzzles" is an interesting way to keep the pace of a game going. This is a case where a limitation on the budget ultimately proved to be a great outlet for storytelling purposes, and it doesn't stand out with the rest of the game.\n\nSadly, the one character you will be hearing a lot of is not the best actor, Didi. Dawn never speaks, and Didi will give you instructions on what to do and where to go at every point in the game.\n\nDidi is not the only obstruction from the otherwise fun, creative gameplay. Forced cutscenes showing key-parts of the room are triggered way too much to let the player figure out the puzzle, and the constant text-prompts for objectives are not necessary either.\n\nBoth of these take the player out of the experience and they are not necessary. You won't get lost as the game is very linear and the areas are never that big.\n\nThe story is split between three acts. Act 1 and 2 go hand-in-hand in terms of the game's simple, yet clever difficulty as well as the narrative tying in together. Act 3, however, intrudes upon an otherwise surreal story with realistic explainations and a twist ending that ends abruptly for no good reason other than to end the story there.\n\nThe twist and darker elements within Act 3 are not a problem because they don't make sense. In fact, like with The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, they might make too much sense for my liking.\n\nMy problem is how they feel ultimately rushed into the game to give it a deeper meaning, and once I reached that point of the game I knew my early expectations were wrong. (It's a shame because I think having the PLAYER be an imaginary friend is the perfect explanation for a video-game.)\n\nThe devs stated they wanted to keep the ending short and brief to leave the game open-ended. While I am fine with games that have ambigious endings on purpose, like LISA, I don't think Contrast left an ending satisfying enough for the player to be left thinking about.\n\nExcept for what might have been in the story instead.\n\nA Flawed, But Ultimately Charming Game\nI wouldn't recommend Contrast for full-asking price as there is not enough content to warrant it (nor replay value). Nor is the game as finely polished to be liked by everyone. But Contrast is still a good game, which sees through with its ideas giving all its got while being in the spotlight.\n\nIt's a game that won't make you cry in the end because of the emotional attachment you experience; it's a game that will make you cry because you don't want the curtain-call to be over so soon.","November 1, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You play Dawn a woman with the power   to shift from the 3D world into the 2D shadow world. Also Dawn can only be seen by her young friend Didi who also happens to be the only person Dawn can see as everyone else can only be seen as a shadow.\n\nThe game is a pretty decent puzzle platformer, with a mix of 3D platforming and 2D when you shift into the shadows. This mechanic makes for some good puzzle sections as you need to shift in and out of the shadows to complete them. The visual style of the game is great as well with a sort of 30's noir vibe to the world Dawn and Didi inhabit, as well as a decent soundtrack to match.\n\nThe biggest problem with this game is it's criminally short. I was left wanting more at the end and it really lets the game down.\n\nThe Good:\n- intersting mechanic of shifting from 3d to 2d to complete puzzles\n- this game looks pretty good with a 30's Paris look to it\n-a good jazzy soundtrack that really adds to the feel of the game.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Very short and i was left wanting more\n-Little replay value\n\nOverall this is a pretty good game which i enjoyed but it really is too short to justify paying full price. If it's reduced on offer and you like puzzle platformer pick it up. 6.5/10","September 13, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The art style, music and time setting are right up my street and the whole game takes place in a slightly surreal 'Alice In Wonderland' style. I'll explain. The world seems to be made of of floating islands floating in a night sky, it looks lovely but detracts the game from normality, that being said playing as an imaginary friend who can jump in and out of shadows ins't exactly normal so this floating island surreal-ness actually adds to the game, pushing it away from normal and closer to dream-like.\n\nAs I have said the music is also fantastic if you enjoy cabaret style music. There are also some lovely other tracks later in the game, one of my favorite plays during the carousel puzzle.\n\nThe whole jumping between shadows and normal world is an awesome mechanic. Not exactly new but it is still nicely done and it creates some interesting and genuinely challenging puzzles that stumped me for an embarissingly long time. One thing I will say is that it can be a bit trickey at times. The switching between the shadow and real worlds is tricky especially when jumping. If you don't time it right when jumping you will land half above, half in the shadow which gives you another 50/50 chance of clipping onto the shadow or being forced back into the real world which will probably spawn you into a death pit. After 6 or more times this gets annoying. The run animation is also odd too and the main character moves like she has a rocket attached to her back and strides like the Striders from Half Life 2.\n\nAside from those 2 tiny nit picks the story is good, visuals great and soundtrack fantastic. Pick it up, play it and you'll be glad you did.\n\nCheck out my youtbe channel for lets plays and commentary every Monday and Friday\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg","December 4, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has some strong points, as well as some lesser ones. I'll see if I can post it without one to get around that pickle.\n\nThe strong points sort of sells itself on the store: the visuals and the ideas. Oh, and the voice-acting and the audio.\n\nTheme-wise, this is a wonderful film noir kind of feel with the old stylish drama and some genuinely fitting soundtracks that perfectly fit the gameplay mechanics. Climbing the shadow of the musicians or the voice actors while they are acting their part is original to say the least. As well as having the far majority of the cast consist merely of shadows (which gives the game a strange atmosphere).\n\nUnfortunately, while the gameplay is certainly fitting with the theme, the switching between 3rd person adventuring and 2d 'shadow' platforming doesn't quite mix that well. Despite the contrast in lighting, you sometimes have to guess where you can fade in the shadows, and sometimes you almost randomly drop out again. And rearranging lights in a 3D plane is a lot harder to properly 'aim' than in a 2D one (for those who are familiar with A shadow's tale: control was much tighter there).\n\nI'm not so sure what to think of the plot. While the atmosphere, voices and visuals are all in place, I wasn't drawn into the game much. I partly blame the clunky controls and some glaring bugs (I encountered numerous invisible walls and pass-through walls), and partly because the far majority of the game you're just a nanny for Didi ("let's fix this! let's fix that!"), while your own role isn't explained until nearly the end (which is a shame. How am I supposed to care for the characters if I don't know what my own role in the play is to begin with?).\n\nWhile contrast also has some platforming and puzzle segments, the only real meat is the storyline. It has those things, and they sort of work, but you'll push on through to get the next cutscene. And with that in mind, it should at the very least be labeled at "not bad at all". Awesome would be giving it too much credit, but it's certainly decent.\nI just wish more was put into it. Bug testing. The conversations. Perhaps some extra thought for lip syncing (there is only one character who has all the monologues, but her lips seem to say something competely different).\n\nBut all in all, I'd say this is the sort of game I would give a 6.5 - 7. It's a good game. Not a great one. All in my opinion, of course. :-)","October 16, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have the ability to jump in and out the shadows to progress the game and solve very well design puzzles.\n\n-Oooh!! I love the Puppet Theater part!!! So enjoyable!!!\n\n-The music is beatiful, especially the song of Didi's Mother. Suitable for the special world the developers created.\n\n-Likeable main character. Even if your character you control doesn't speak or doesn't show a lot of personality, if you pay attention and collect the extra items, you will learn more about her.\n\n-By the way, the Extra items you collect actually is woth finding. You learn interesting and in my opinion important details about the whole plot of the game and for the characters.\n\n-A surprise twist at the end of the game. Not a twist like "HOLY SH*T SON!!!!! FDfkmdnmmsEDf!!!", but more like "very interesting. I need to learn more".\n\n[Cons]\n\n-Didi..........shut the f*ck up. At first you where ok girl, I really liked you, but after 1 hour, your voice become irritating to my nerves....I really wished the main character had a voice so I had a break from Didi's yapping.\n\n-The shadows of the characters needed more work. This sound strange, but when you notice that the shadows don't move their lips [except Didi] and their hands movements sometimes are lifeless [except Didi again], you will understand my nitpick.\n\n-The controls are ok.....but at some point if you are not precise with your movements, you will see yourself jump back and forth from a shadow without wanted to do it. At some point I wanted to pass a moving gear while I was a shadow, but every time I wanted to move, I became normal and fall down.........20 times I think.....f*ck.\n\n-The story is ok, but not something very exciting. I was more interested in the extras, than the main story with the exception the ending.\n\n-Very short game. I finished in less 3 hours.\n\n-Very unsatisfying. Being a very short game, it let you with a desire to learn more about this world. I hope for a sequel to cover my curiosity for some details I wanted to learn.\n\n[Final Thought]\n\nI really liked this game, even with the some frustrations I had while playing it.\nHowever because the game is very short and a not very interesting story, I suggest you buy it when it get cheaper.\nWith that said, I hope for a sequel for this game.

The story and music are really well done and the characters are incredible - if you are nostalgic for the big band, gumshoe era, this game is right up your alley.  Loading it is a little tricky as you will likely need a patch, but once you get it working there are very few hitches or problems.  The game play is unique with you playing a character that moves in and out of shadows and helps a little girl find her way in the world.  Most of the puzzles are fairly straight-forward and are somewhat portal-like in their layout.  I was able to solve most without assistance.

I couldn't stop! It was a lot of fun - not too challenging, interesting storyline. Wonderful graphics, audio, and characters. It was shorter than I expected, but I enjoyed it a lot and really hope for a sequel. I am sick to death of fighting games, so a game with no fighting at all that was still fun, interesting, and different was a very pleasant change of pace. Its replayability isn't /too/ high, since once you've figured out the puzzles, it's easy to breeze through, but I would play through again simply because it was fun and I loved playing. All in all, I would very much recommend this game to anyone seeking a new game that's challenging, but not to hard, without any fighting, and a great soundtrack.","November 18, 2014","true","11.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are equasions which Mathematicians and Physicists say put a smile of delight on their faces and which they describe as beautiful. That may seem odd, but they understand the complexities of these acadamic arts and therefore percieve how hard it is to produce something simple yet powerful. For anyone who has an interest in game design - you will have the same reaction to Contrast.\n\nThe game is elegant in design, form and presentation. Simple in concept yet profound in its scope and it is a genuine shame that the idea of moving into a world of shadows and back out again hasn't really been explored much in any form of media; be it literiture, movie or gaming. If there was ever a game that deserved a sequel it would be this one. We're talking about the kind of simplicity and genius as when someone said; Lets make a game about wormholes and using them to solve puzzles. Contrast is as unique and creative as Portal without any shadow of a doubt, if you'll excuse the pun.\n\nAt it's core it's about puzzle solving, but there is a bit of a storyline in there as well. Although it isn't fleshed out much. The setting itself is the very distinctive Paris of the 1920's but with a weird blend of 20's America as well. I won't ruin the surprize but you'll start to understand that something isn't quite right with the world when you start wandering around the streets. As for the level of difficulty, it isn't too taxing. But the variety of gameplay and novel use of moving into shadows is constantly compelling. This is a short, but perfectly polished gem of a game which is well worth a look.\n\nAs an aside, the game can be played with either a pad or the keyboard and mouse. I would suggest using a pad because when using the keyboard there is a weird 'floaty' feel about movement which feels wrong. This may in fact cause frustration, as a number of more tricky platforming sections of the game would be made unpleasently awkward if you use the keyboard and mouse. Once you use a pad however, the controls are rock solid and precise.","September 5, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Consistantly testing your perspective of lighting and which dimension you should be within. The game adds an interesting 3D world aswell as a constant 2D platformer which you have to vary between in order to complete puzzles. Having the power to slip between the open 3D world to hopping from shadow to shadow in 2D at your own will opens up some very clever puzzling possibilities.\n\nThroughout the game there's a gripping emotional story line in which follows the main little girl, Didi. As she is always trying to help out her close-to-useless father, having to deal with various mobsters, aswell as an illusionist puzzle master. As Didi’s imaginary friend, you can only see the shadows and hear the voices of the real people within the 3D world, in which Didi interacts with. But again within the 2D world there is great interaction of the real people's shadows and a fulfilling sense of achievment once you complete a puzzle.\n\nAs with all medium to low budget puzzle games there are a few bugs/glitches but nothing you can't turn your head at. Some of the puzzels can be very cliche: move a box over a button = door opens. But there was a few interesting ones you'll have to think twice about.\n\nOverall gameplay was enjoyable and certainly made you want to finish the game, yet only being 3-5 hours long depending on collectables and the narrations. It’s hard to say whether Contrast looks better while playing as one of the minimalist silhouettes or running around in full 3D. The graphics are a key aspect of the game, being set in such a hearty destination the overly cartoon design looks great and is consistant throughout.\n\n8/10\n\n","September 18, 2015","true","18.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","3","2","0"

I played it some time back so I cannot write out an exhaustive review, but suffice to say the setting, story, soundtrack and voice-acting were all decent here. The artstyle especially was unique though. The game mechanics are interesting, but they were never fully fleshed out. The puzzles are mostly of moderate difficulty, but one or two of the later ones might frustrate you for a while.\n\nThe game is a bit rough around the edges with texture pop-ins, some wonky animations and some other minor control bugs. The ending felt a bit rushed for the story. Length wise, it is pretty short at 3 hours or so, and you should be able to 100% the game in around 4 hours.\n\nIf you go in with your expectations in check and manage to get this game on a discount, I'd be pretty certain you'll come away liking it.

I’m glad I did because, in retrospect, I wouldn’t have wanted to waste more money than I already did on it.\nThis is not something that I would call a puzzle game. A puzzle implies that there is an intricate mental test to perform that has a rewarding outcome if you can find and place all the pieces. To solve the puzzles in this game you just have to perform trial and error because there really is no intuitive puzzle to be had. You platform around as a shadow on the wall to perform an arbitrary task and that’s about it. The “puzzle” aspect comes in, I GUESS, when you turn a wheel or press a button and the shadows move and you continue platforming. Maybe it’s that some of the buttons are on timers? I suppose some people would consider that a puzzle……But if you find those people, please, remind them to take the plastic bag off of their head once in awhile.\nBottom line: I wouldn’t recommend this game unless you have a big hard-on for platformers….But there ARE better platformers…..Much better.\nI’ve played about an hour and a half of the game and I’m over half done. I just simply don’t see any point in prolonging the review. I’m probably not even going to get around to finishing this game.","January 1, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That really depends what you're trying to get out of it.\n\nAs a game I think Contrast falls flat. The controlls feel unnatural, the shadow thing feels like a gimmick, the puzzles are uninspired and the only challenge is rooted in the poor controls and a camera programmed solely to avoid the angles that you actually need. That said, the soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics, especially the character models, look like something from a Tim Burton stop motion (in a good way) and the story is compelling (that's not the same as good)\n\nIn the end Contrast won me over.

This is a beautiful game, with great writing, solid ideal mechanics and a fun asthetic. But the coding is so bad. This game is not a puzzle game, often times you will figure out the puzzle then retry it 10-30 times because it's actually a near pixle perfect platformer, has completely unreliable physics which is what makes it maddening. I want to get involved with this story I dont want to try a jump 20 times in a row where it takes 10 times to figure out exactly when I have to jump to not drop out of shadow then another 10 to figure out what rotating object I have to get on that will get to the top.

This game is a story-rich, highly stylized, puzzle platformer.  It's main mechanic is changing from 3D platforming and shadow shifting into 2D platforming (as well as using the shadows to move things like boxes and balls that you also shift into the 2D shadow world).  It tells the story of a little girl and her doting father and mother (as well as a quirky magician) as the doting father tries to win his way back into his mother's graces (with you and the daughter's help).\n\nI really enjoyed the mechanics.  Although they are spotty and inconsistent sometimes (but they did this all with the Unreal Engine, which is amazing work in my opinion), but the vast majority of the time they work perfectly fine.  The music is great too!  If you like "video games as art," this is definitely one of them.","October 19, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem is that the game could do so much more with them, and inevitably you are left with a pool of really good if not great ideas that never really amount to much.\nThe game is definatly good, and I hope that Compulsion will revisit it in the future to flesh out these ideas.

It twists your way of thinking and never quite leaves you sure which world is the real one, 3D or the 2D one. Play this for the story which gives off just enough details to be intruiging but also to leave you guessing and filling in the gaps.\n\nGame itself works mostly well, there were a few times when the shadow hoping was a bit glitchy (would drop me out and I had to retry a few times) but overall worked well.

Yes, it does, but nothing much to make you stop playing. For one, this game is fairly short, only three acts. I played 8 hours and got all the collectibles and achievements.

It twists your way of thinking and never quite leaves you sure which world is the real one, 3D or the 2D one. Play this for the story which gives off just enough details to be intruiging but also to leave you guessing and filling in the gaps.\n\nGame itself works mostly well, there were a few times when the shadow hoping was a bit glitchy (would drop me out and I had to retry a few times) but overall worked well.

Only rating it an 8/10 however because of bugs and other issues (note: my computer exceeds the recommended requirements and played the game fine on high settings). At times, Dawn will slide around at high speeds or suddenly stop moving due to some invisible obstruction. That's annoying while walking down the middle of the road, but downright frustrating when trying to solve puzzles, especially while in shadowland. These movements sometimes cause Dawn to shift out of shadows at inopportune times as well, requiring restarting entire puzzles. The worst issue, however, are the occasional times when something that is supposed to sparkle (such as an item that can be used or a collectible) does NOT sparkle, and thus can't be used. Collectibles don't stop you from completing the game, but the usable items not sparkling certainly will. I was able to solve this issue by restarting the game, but it's still annoying and meant lost progress.\n\nAll in all though, I would still recommend Contrast.","November 30, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the amount I bought it for, I felt this game was not polished very well, and it certainly doesn't help that the secondary character you follow was written in a very annoying manner.

I’m glad I did because, in retrospect, I wouldn’t have wanted to waste more money than I already did on it.\nThis is not something that I would call a puzzle game. A puzzle implies that there is an intricate mental test to perform that has a rewarding outcome if you can find and place all the pieces. To solve the puzzles in this game you just have to perform trial and error because there really is no intuitive puzzle to be had. You platform around as a shadow on the wall to perform an arbitrary task and that’s about it. The “puzzle” aspect comes in, I GUESS, when you turn a wheel or press a button and the shadows move and you continue platforming. Maybe it’s that some of the buttons are on timers? I suppose some people would consider that a puzzle……But if you find those people, please, remind them to take the plastic bag off of their head once in awhile.\nBottom line: I wouldn’t recommend this game unless you have a big hard-on for platformers….But there ARE better platformers…..Much better.\nI’ve played about an hour and a half of the game and I’m over half done. I just simply don’t see any point in prolonging the review. I’m probably not even going to get around to finishing this game.","January 1, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The initial idea of switching from 3D "surreal reality" to 2D where you become a shadow and walk on shadows is clever and fun. This is what the game is mostly about: solving riddles and tasks by making use of light and shadow, mixed with a lovely story. The world of Contrast is beautiful and very atmospheric and a bit bizarre at the same time. It's pretty much like a dream.

Worth supporting the developers even if just on sale)\n\nI'll be honest - I went in prepared to love the sshit out of this game. The artwork was sublime, the music was orjazzmic and the concept was brilliant. Venturebeat had me at "It's as if Limbo and Bioshock Infinite had a baby while watching Pan's Labyrinth" - given that I'd just finished Limbo, and, well, I'm sure my avatar tells you all you need to know about Infinite.\n\nUnfortunately, however, Contrast is not without its flaws, like the characters the game adeptly depicts. The story was well paced and engaging and there were some genuinely clever puzzles in the piece, but an overuse of cut-scenes and needlessly fiddly gameplay detracted from the overall satisfactory experience.\n\nYou play as Dawn, nine-year-old Didi's imaginary friend. Dawn helps Didi solve puzzles and navigate a troubled maze of family relationships by manipulating light and shadow in a sometimes third-person 3D puzzly, sometimes 2D-ish platformy, surreal depiction of the interwar era. The game marries the music of the Jazz Age with high-contrast film noir aesthetics and archetypes, and largely makes this work. It just looks and sounds beautiful, and the voice acting is realistic and moving, especially Didi.\n\nThere were lots of things the designers managed to get right - little things I really appreciated, like colour-coding the on-screen button prompts (Call me crap, but I'm still SO confused with the XBox buttons because they're the wrong way around from Super Nintendo!) or making it optional to collect everything, but easy to go back; this goes for Luminaries and collectibles. The final puzzles were immensely satisfying; I successfully put to use everything the game had taught me, which meant the learning curve was well thought out. Another thing was the inclusion of the soundtrack and a PDF of the collector's booklet.\n\nAnd now for the whinge. The plot was engrossing, but I got sick to death of being interrupted by cut-scenes every few nanoseconds. The developers, again, got things right by making these skippable, but I felt I couldn't skip them anyway because I didn't want to miss the story. This and the way the camera kept getting yanked out of my control while trying to solve puzzles were some of the irritating aspects of the game: these interruptions kept breaking the flow so that things never really settled into a decent rhythm.\n\nThe consequence was that, when it came time to jump around, some of the puzzle-solving was quite hard to execute. I opted for a controller over keyboard and mouse, but wasn't entirely satisfied with either option. Shadow-world play is really fiddly; the camera doesn't neatly snap to a 2D view for this mode and I was forever accidentally leaping off into space and having to try again because of this. A lack of micro-save exacerbated the problem.\n\nWhen not in shadow mode, the camera was at times so far up Dawn's bum it was nigh-on impossible to have a good look round for problem-solving, and at other times I'd solved the puzzle mentally but found the solution needlessly difficult to perform... Why have little bumps on the wall just to break you out of shadow mode and make it more difficult? For other puzzles, there was no intermediate feedback to show when the player was on the right track; the light had to be in exactly the right spot or things didn't work, and I had no idea whether I was right in theory or just all wrong. The game's physics also seemed inconsistent; there were loads of times when it looked like Dawn could easily make a certain jump, but wouldn't. I found all this incredibly frustrating to the point of controller-biting and rage-quitting, actually...\n\nBut Contrast wasn't all bad. As infuriating as the negatives were, the narrative was sustaining with its emphasis on family and dysfunctional relationships. I enjoyed the fact that the characters, though archetypal, were flawed individuals making the best of their respective situations -  a contemporary theme that will resonate with any mature, thinking player.\n\nAdd it to your wishlist and grab it next time it pops up on sale; you'll enjoy the cheap quickie.","August 10, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While you're enjoying the ambience, there's a story about a little girl with family troubles that likes to sneak around at night. You play as her mute shadow-friend, swapping between 3Dspace and the 2D shadows cast upon the world.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly straightforward, although some will take a bit of experimentation. Solving them is less about flipping switches and more comparable to turning the hands on a clock to the correct time: it's difficult to get them in the precise orientation for success, but more often than not you'll get "close enough." As a result of this, a good number of the puzzles left me feeling like I'd somehow found an alternate, unintended solution from point A to B. This was actually the case once or twice, as I had found a way to sneak past a goal and into the next room with no way to continue since I didn't take the expected route. Reloading a previous save and checking online for the actual solution was my workaround that one time.

Worth supporting the developers even if just on sale)\n\nI'll be honest - I went in prepared to love the sshit out of this game. The artwork was sublime, the music was orjazzmic and the concept was brilliant. Venturebeat had me at "It's as if Limbo and Bioshock Infinite had a baby while watching Pan's Labyrinth" - given that I'd just finished Limbo, and, well, I'm sure my avatar tells you all you need to know about Infinite.\n\nUnfortunately, however, Contrast is not without its flaws, like the characters the game adeptly depicts. The story was well paced and engaging and there were some genuinely clever puzzles in the piece, but an overuse of cut-scenes and needlessly fiddly gameplay detracted from the overall satisfactory experience.\n\nYou play as Dawn, nine-year-old Didi's imaginary friend. Dawn helps Didi solve puzzles and navigate a troubled maze of family relationships by manipulating light and shadow in a sometimes third-person 3D puzzly, sometimes 2D-ish platformy, surreal depiction of the interwar era. The game marries the music of the Jazz Age with high-contrast film noir aesthetics and archetypes, and largely makes this work. It just looks and sounds beautiful, and the voice acting is realistic and moving, especially Didi.\n\nThere were lots of things the designers managed to get right - little things I really appreciated, like colour-coding the on-screen button prompts (Call me crap, but I'm still SO confused with the XBox buttons because they're the wrong way around from Super Nintendo!) or making it optional to collect everything, but easy to go back; this goes for Luminaries and collectibles. The final puzzles were immensely satisfying; I successfully put to use everything the game had taught me, which meant the learning curve was well thought out. Another thing was the inclusion of the soundtrack and a PDF of the collector's booklet.\n\nAnd now for the whinge. The plot was engrossing, but I got sick to death of being interrupted by cut-scenes every few nanoseconds. The developers, again, got things right by making these skippable, but I felt I couldn't skip them anyway because I didn't want to miss the story. This and the way the camera kept getting yanked out of my control while trying to solve puzzles were some of the irritating aspects of the game: these interruptions kept breaking the flow so that things never really settled into a decent rhythm.\n\nThe consequence was that, when it came time to jump around, some of the puzzle-solving was quite hard to execute. I opted for a controller over keyboard and mouse, but wasn't entirely satisfied with either option. Shadow-world play is really fiddly; the camera doesn't neatly snap to a 2D view for this mode and I was forever accidentally leaping off into space and having to try again because of this. A lack of micro-save exacerbated the problem.\n\nWhen not in shadow mode, the camera was at times so far up Dawn's bum it was nigh-on impossible to have a good look round for problem-solving, and at other times I'd solved the puzzle mentally but found the solution needlessly difficult to perform... Why have little bumps on the wall just to break you out of shadow mode and make it more difficult? For other puzzles, there was no intermediate feedback to show when the player was on the right track; the light had to be in exactly the right spot or things didn't work, and I had no idea whether I was right in theory or just all wrong. The game's physics also seemed inconsistent; there were loads of times when it looked like Dawn could easily make a certain jump, but wouldn't. I found all this incredibly frustrating to the point of controller-biting and rage-quitting, actually...\n\nBut Contrast wasn't all bad. As infuriating as the negatives were, the narrative was sustaining with its emphasis on family and dysfunctional relationships. I enjoyed the fact that the characters, though archetypal, were flawed individuals making the best of their respective situations -  a contemporary theme that will resonate with any mature, thinking player.\n\nAdd it to your wishlist and grab it next time it pops up on sale; you'll enjoy the cheap quickie.","August 10, 2014","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It tells the story of a little girl and her doting father and mother (as well as a quirky magician) as the doting father tries to win his way back into his mother's graces (with you and the daughter's help).\n\nI really enjoyed the mechanics.

Jumping could be frustrating at times because it's a little to sensitive to collisions and it would have been nice to be able to customize the key mapping but that's about it.\nIt's a short game but one I will remember for a long time.

The basic concept of using shadows is just really inventive, and being able to manipulate them meant that the level design became even more impressive. I loved the concept. I thought the world imagery was great with soemwhere between a 1930's dreamscape, and the music were wonderfully sultry and bluesy. The visuals are of a good standard too with a clear style. Overall its a very clever game, with some really well thought through touches and a great feel to it\nOn the bad side, the puzzles are a little easy to complete and the game is just too short. I don't consider myself to be a particularly good platform player, so with only 5 hours to complete the whole thing, it felt a bit lacking in depth. The plot was good enough, though I felt there was more of a story to tell, so it could've done with more development. The controls are a little glitchy at times too and you'll miss jumps.

I recommend this game for those of you who like platformers or atmostpheric stories.\n\nMy one complaint about the game is that the collision boxes are sometimes unpredictable, such that you may occasionally misjudge your jumps or object interactions.  However, this doesn't really affect your ability to complete the game, so you may consider this a minor nitpick.\n\nThe story is of the "small and personal" kind.

The story of the game largely revolves around a broken family trying to piece itself together and is at its best when it focuses on their trials and tribulations. (It takes a weird turn near the end trying to answer questions I never asked about the broken shadow dimension that protagonist Dawn inhabits that just end up raising even more questions, but that treads into spoiler territory.) Manipulating shadows so that Dawn can become a shadow and platform across them proved to be an interesting challenge that had me scratching my head more than a few times, and they were never afraid of introducing new elements (even if some of those elements involved box-switch puzzles seen in many games before). The game is definitely a bit on the short side, however, and the only thing that kept me from clearing it 100% on my first run was a few collectibles and one item that was only available for a short time frame and ended up being lost forever. It's also very story-focused, and relies heavily on cutscenes to tell its tale. Overall, it's definitely flawed (probably rushed a bit to be a PS4 launch title), but it's an enjoyable game that should be tried.","December 22, 2013","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The shortness of the game means that the puzzle mechanics are never given the time to fully grow.

Contrast has a patchwerk story, which is incredibly unfortunate given the potential of the lore (it's visibly rushed despite a very interesting world).  I love the art style, and particularly love the 2D/3D platforming crossovers.  Contrast cleverly utilises intricate 3D world objects to affect the 2D world (to use a basic example that doesn't spoil the puzzles, dragging an item closer to the light to make the shadow on the wall bigger).  It has a 'cute' companion character and touches on some of the deeper issues surrounding families, but it only lasts about 2-3 hours on a slow playthrough.  I would say about 20-30 minutes of that focuses on the story, and the majority is spent trying to figure out the tricks for the puzzles.  Once you work them out, you could probably play from start to finish in less than an hour, without skipping.\n\nThere are two types of collectibles.  One type of collectible comes from exploring and overcoming optional puzzles, and is essentially useless outside of the few occasions you need them to progress (When you need them to progress, they're very easy to find).  The other works to build up the lore, and it's quite expansive.  These collectibles flesh out the story in much greater detail than the main storyline, but mostly they serve to highlight just how unfortunate it is that Contrast was cut short.\n\nThe pros:\nAn old-fashioned setting with a great accompanying visual style\nCool dynamics between 2D and 3D elements\nSome deep themes around family\nClever use of mechanics in puzzles\nInteresting lore\n\nThe cons:\nShallow and disjointed story, with a very rushed ending.\nThe majority of playtime and difficulty comes from initially working out puzzle styles\nAn irrelevant collection system (not referring to the lore collectibles)\n\nThe verdict:\nPick it up if you enjoy games with a sense of uniqueness, or the potential for depth (rather than depth itself).  Contrast will test your lateral thinking (though only on a few occasions), and it touches on some pretty cool concepts.","October 17, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There was actually a lot that erked me. For example, the game screwed with my mouse sensitivity in game, so i had to tweak it so the camera wasn't making me dizzy. Also, it was a bit more demanding on my pc then i thought it would (but my pc is old. Any up to date pc should do fine). Fixed camera angles when interecting with objects can also be a bit obnoxious.\n\nHowever... for the flaws, this game was really enjoyable. It's a bit of soul food, makes you think and ask questions. It feels substantial as far as the story and the world is concerned (Some say gameplay is lacking challange, but for me it lacked a lot of the frustration that can come with some puzzle games with obtuse solutions. For example, the secret star solutions in Braid, one of which requires you to do nothing but wait for nearly 40 minutes or so). The art is fantastic, definitely different from what i've played recently. The Music and overal sound design is wonderful, though the voice acting isn't the best.\n\nContrast is one of those examples of "Games are Art" while still being a game, as opposed to a tour with some narration over top. If you don't mind a short, but fufilling experiance or some so so gameplay, and you want a great story, world, and overall aesthetic then pick up contrast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/worlebird/recommended/224460/","worlebird","worlebird","http://steamcommunity.com/id/worlebird/","146 products in account","I'm going to recommend this game, but I will give a caveat - I bought it on a good sale, when it was under 4 bucks.  At that price, it's well worth it.  At full price... probably not.\n\nThis is a nice little game, with a really fantastic concept - the idea of shifting in and out of a 2D shadow world, and solving puzzles by moving objects and lights in 3D in order to properly align their shadows in 2D is very clever.  The music and atmosphere is quite nice as well, and the voice acting is well-done.  The story is a little thin, but I can't complain too much about that.\n\nNow, the down sides.  First off, the game is quite short.  I completed it in just a few hours, and I'm sure many players could do it in even less time.  Also, the controls are a little... I don't know how to describe it, exactly.  Often, when working in the 3D world, the camera will drift a little oddly, and you end up running into a wall unintentionally.  In the 2D world, you find yourself occasionally falling out of the shadows for small things - bumping into the wrong shadow, jumping across a wall of a darker color.  Not consistently, and not enough to ruin the game, but enough to make it a little frustrating occasionally.  Control just doesn't always feel right.\n\nWhile there are some good puzzles, and the atmosphere is quite interesting, often it feels like the designers weren't quite sure what to do with the concept.  Finally, gameplay is interrupted far too often by cutscenes.  I understand the desire to tell the story, and to set the stage for each new area, but it is annoying when control is taken from you every 5 minutes or so.\n\nThis review ended up seeming a lot more negative than I actually feel about the game.  As I said at the start, if you get it on sale for less that 5 dollars or so, I think it's worth it, if you enjoy casual puzzle games with a unique atmosphere.  Ultimately, though, I would love to see this concept fleshed out more in another game.  It's a great idea that this game just couldn't quite do justice to.","October 11, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The idea of changing from 2D to 3D really inovates (even though there was already a game that came with a concept a lot like that called Perspective, it's a f2p game, go and check it yourself), and brings lots of great moments, but also buggy ones. There were moments where the puzzle wasn't the challenge it self, but the glitches.\nThere were also mechanics that could have been more exploited.\n\n2) Art/ Soundtrack/ Voiceacting\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is well built by the scenario and the sound track, art desgin really fit's in, but there are problems. The animations weren't much organic (and seem really half baked), there were buggy shadows and some halfbaked props, missing collison on places where it clearly should have something.\nThe voice acting actually impressed me. It's not exceptional, but it fits in to the characters really nicely.\n\n3) Story\n\nThe story of Contrast may be for some one of the strogesnt points, but I have to disagree a little bit on that one.\nThe story really intrigued me, and it really got me thinking, but there were some really strange moments.\nSometimes it's to obvious that the developers didn't have in mind much about the story, only about the gamplay. But it's a nice story, and the gap for theories are wide open for interpretetions. There are some people making some deep theories, but to  be honest, I don't think they really thought about all that.\n\n4)Conclusion:\nIt's a nice expirience, but it seems like the game was rushed, it's short and there are lots of things that could have been more polished. It's worth a try","October 12, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its graphics are well detailed, and the way that light is used in this game is borderline genius. The voicework is well done for all characters. The music is excellent, being very rythmic and jazzy. And the story is quite interesting. The collection of collectable that you can obtain is both expansive and impactful for the length of the game. The Bioshock-esque way of using collectables to explain plot points was well done. It was always interesting to read an article about a missing person, or seeing a picture of the "scientific" explainations of the shadow world. The light puzzles that are used are especially interesting because the game mechanic of switching between two worlds is wonderfully unique and fun. All of these factors really combine to create an incredible atmosphere.\nHowever no game is without its imperfections. Though I do, in fact, recommend this game to anyone who wants a interesting experience, I must also explain the game's faults. Contrast has 2 major flaws which both fall into the gameplay category. The main problem is that Dawn, the main character, is incredibly floaty. She's a tad hard to control because her jump arc seems a tad unnatural. The second would probably be the camera. See the having the camera be controlled by the mouse is fine in third person, but when you enter the shadow world the camera tends to be kinda random, causing you to have to adjust your mouse in odd ways.\nThe small gameplay flaws that Contrast has pales in comparison to the experience of playing it though. Playing through the game is honestly just a marvelous experience, because of it's brilliant atmosphere, as well as its unique concept.","February 26, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Utilize this to explore new possibilities in platforming.\n\nStory\nThe game is divided up into chapters and acts, which you can select from the main screen if you wish. However, the game is really short. I clocked in with about 4 hours on my first playthrough, an hour of which I don't think I was playing. In addition, some mechanic frustrations also prolonged my playthrough.\n\nYou play as a character named Dawn, whom only Didi can see. Didi is a child of a broken family who is trying to get back together leading to the different levels you encounter. Sometimes this leads to some interesting levels.\n\nThe game also tries to induce a little mystery of if Dawn is real or not and what exactly is she. However, the game doesn't go too far along that route that it doesn't really matter, especially at the end.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are okay. I had to run this on low settings so I cannot testify how great it can be besides online videos and pictures. I also wonder if the lack of some environment is a result of my computer or design. It does lead to some cool views. The shadow style is a pretty nifty idea that helps distract the player. As I was watching the cutscenes, I was wondering if people can be charmed by simply a shadow on the wall and a voice.\n\nSound\nThe game has a Jazz music style. It fits with the setting, and the vocals aren't bad in that respect.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjMxRkKnnOI#t=27\n\nThe vocals are actually fairly good too. Didi can get annoying sometimes, but sometimes her actions actually brought a smile. It's interesting that Dawn is voiceless but I guess that's to keep the player guessing what she is exactly and if she's real.\n\nGameplay\nThis game had a lot of promise. The idea of manipulating shadows to create solid platforming makes it a small thinking game as well. When I was little, I used to contemplate how interesting it would be if you can become a shadow. This game allows me to play with that idea a little bit, but not as much as I would have liked.\n\nYou are given 5 basic controls for most of the game. Movement, Interaction, Shifting, Jump, and Dash. You also have control of the camera, which leads me to controller preferences. You do not want to play this game with a mouse and keyboard if you can avoid it. The camera is controlled with the mouse, which you also use for Dash and Shifting. This becomes a problem when you accidently move the camera while meaning to shift or dash. It has led me to many frustrations. The camera setting with the mouse is also too sensitive even after I adjusted it to get it right. When I switched to a 360 controller, the experience improved greatly. The camera was fine and my hands were less confused with which button was shift and which was dash.\n\nThis game has no action in it, which is good for this style. Since there are no enemies to fight, you can focus on the platforming and puzzles you are given. The promise of the game expands with the different mechanics you find in the different chapters. There is some room for exploration, but not too much freedom. ONe time when I wanted to wander, Didi would interfere and force me to continue.\n\nSpeaking of Didi, this game started to make me think about useless companions in video games; Didi is one of them. While you need to follow her to know what you next mission is, she never really helps you out. There is one occasion where she helps you out in the story and that is it. It's a shame because the image I posted near the top seemed to promise that you can use Didi to create an environment for you. There is one particular scene where I wish I could have controlled Didi to use something she was right next to instead of me doing something more complex than it needed.\n\nOne of the things that could use some fine tuning is the mechanics. I resorted to Gamefaqs for one thing only to find that I was doing it right all along, but the game mechanics would screw it up.  The glitch I'm referring to is the game forcing you or an object to shift out where it shouldn't. Eventually I got it to work, but I was still upset over the whole thing. Unfortunately, the mechanics would still be glitchy every now and then, forcing me to restart multiple times when I should have easily progressed. It's a shame too, because if it wasn't for the occasional glitchy mechanics, it would have been a solid platformer. The game does have some redemption on the matter by giving you multiple checkpoints to restart from when you die and it doesn't take too long to reload.\n\nReplayability\nAs mentioned before, the game is short and you can select specific chapters to play again. However, with the frustrations I encountered with the mechanics, and the story not being so grand, I probably would stay away from it for a while before trying to play again.\n\nOverall\nThis is one of those little disappointments for me. The game has promise and it shows it in sparks throughout the game. Unfortunately, it never completely capitalizes on it's potential. It can give you an interesting experience, but I think I would have more faith if they did a sequel with solid mechanics. This is a game where you might want to wait for a good sale before you buy it (maybe $5-7).\n\nMy recommendation is for platforming fans who want to try something a little different. If you play with a controller and on a computer that can run it smoothly, then it is less frustrating and possible to enjoy.\n\n\nTaken from my blog at http://www.ign.com/blogs/falconrise/2014/02/16/game-review-contrast-for-pc","February 27, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The technical approach is good in how you can shift in an our of shadows, but the problem is that the areas you can do this in are very limited and separated from each other, making each puzzle its own microcosm.   The puzzles that use this aren't that difficult as well, with the most difficult ones being where you can either move objects to change shadows or the location of the light source. Again, with the puzzles being separate entities, these are one-stop problems as opposed to part of a larger difficult mechanism to figure out.\n\nThe story is interesting but it's hard to get into and leaves some questions on getting into the characters. Whether this is a fantasy, a dream, or something else isn't clear, and whether it is a flashback or the like.  As such, the game quickly devolves into just moving from puzzle to puzzle with story getting in the way.\n\nIt is still a decent game, but it's one I'd wait for a sale for, getting about 3 hrs of playtime from it.","March 2, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have any liking for French jazz culture, this is the game for you. It is all about using light in creative ways to solve puzzles, most of which are platforming.\n\nMy favorite pieces are the music which was put together with care. The vocalist they hired to sing a couple songs has the perfect voice for this type of jazz. All of the voice acting is quite solid. The other piece that drew me in was the use of shadows to represent characters rather than physical beings. I think that is explained through collectibles, but I haven't spent much time with it. Contrast also manages to portray a sense of innocence surrounding Didi while giving some very adult conflicts when she's not around.\n\nThe only real issue I had was with either the controls or the design, I'm not sure. Sometimes when something seemed easy to accomplish, like a jump, you'd be force off the wall for some reason and have to start over. Basically I think some of the shadows in the environment were unintentional and created surprise blocks for you to avoid. It could also just be I'm not very practiced at platformers. The puzzles seem well designed and not too challenging to figure out. After figuring out what needs to be done, you may still need to take a few tries at it before succeeding, but it isn't usually too frustrating.\n\nIt is quite a short game if you figure out the puzzles quickly, it took me maybe 6 hours.

The game simply doesn’t work at what it is trying to do and, as such, is utterly unrecommendable.\n\nIt starts… bad, and only gets worse. The game has no rebindable keys, the mouse cursor doesn’t work in every menu (like restarting a checkpoint or leaving the game), but it does offer very lacklustre graphic options. Although I like the style of the game, I really disliked its graphics quality. The textures aren’t pretty, and there is nothing to distract from them, as the environments are lifeless and empty. Even the music doesn’t help, as it is barely even present while you are exploring or solving puzzles. Worse, one of the main mechanics of the game requires you to play with shadows, but even they are barebones at best. In the days of soft focus shadows, that’s a big no-no if your main mechanic revolves around them. All the cutscenes and story bits are shown through the shadows too, so you get to experience bad graphics on top of very stick figure-like animations, not even remotely human. Not that it really matters as the story holds no water, but I will get to that in a minute.\nBut alright, let’s give it the benefit of the doubt, what else is there? Any other nitpicks? Well, even though I’m a native French speaker, I preferred the English dub, but the collectibles, with press articles and other, supposedly, world building information extracts, aren’t fully translated! That’s disappointing.\n\nWhat about the gameplay? Well, the controls aren’t rebindable, the camera is atrocious, -which doesn’t help-, and the animation of the character is stiff and “mechanic”. Clunky really, fast and yet without precision. When the camera switches mode, between locked in 2D shadow world and free 3D exploration, it is feels horrible: during the transitions, it is either too quick or too slow, but feels unnatural either way, jarring. You don’t feel in control, you are at the mercy of the game’s whims.\nSo let me get this straight. It is a puzzle platformer with bad controls and bad camera, where you have to jump on platforms made from poorly rendered shadows, from which you will end up sliding off for the smallest offense. This will lead to some frustration since… well, you character doesn’t move like you want it to or the game just refuses to acknowledge your input, for whatever reason, and getting sacked for it, unfairly, is rather infuriating. It is actually so bad, I landed in a secret area one time, one I hadn’t neither seen nor planned on jumping into. Thanks for that I guess, but it isn’t gonna make up for all the bad jump related deaths.\n\nAs said before, even the story didn’t hold my attention. In all honesty, I had a hard time sympathizing with the dad figure. Because he was trying, although he put his family in harm’s way, that makes every alright? When you stand in the rain, you get wet. Don’t. Stand. In. The. Rain. Or least, don’t ask for my sympathy when you complain about getting drenched. The story didn’t resonate with me.\n\nThe nail in the coffin was one particular moment that is reminiscent of Limbo. Except, you know, Limbo kind of works. So now I have a better game in my mind that I could be playing on top of all this nonsense. Anyway, it was too obvious, with the spider and all… You haven’t earned that game, the right to make an ‘homage’ like that. And even if you did, you have a game that is three hours short (and thank god for that! I wouldn’t have been able to play any more of it), and you basically have so little to put in it that you lift levels from another game. That doesn’t come across as very endearing to me.\n\nThere is definitely an interesting concept at the core of the game, with the change between 3D and 2D platformer, and that’s where the puzzles are I suppose, if you can call them that. It is a proof of concept, sure, but that’s not enough for a good game. And it is actually possible to break the puzzles, making them impossible to solve, forcing you to reload if you aren’t careful enough, which you can’t be because of the horrendous controls! At times, it does feel like an endless cycle of displeasure. Certainly, that concept deserved better. As it stands, the game is a demo I would present to my boss in order to get funding for a project based around the shown concept, not a final product I would charge money for.\n\nAll in all, what I am seeing here is a game that had a great gameplay concept, and a great art style, but failed to get to the finish line with them. The game feels rushed, empty in a lot of aspect, barely functional sometimes, without any form of polish whatsoever, and it makes it all the more disappointing when the game does finally decide to work, when, very rarely, there are some “sparks” and it clicks. From time to time, things work out alright, and the puzzles and their solutions aren’t hampered by the flaws of the game, but those shining moments, where the transition from an open world to one of shadows stimulates your brain and gives you the satisfaction of actually solving a problem in a clever way, without the frustration of dealing with force outside your reach, are far too few to justify any consideration of purchase, no matter the price.","June 21, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is short, puzzles easy and sometimes even tiresome, camera jittery and sticky, and I don't even remember the number of times that I got myself stuck behind some piece of furniture or even in the wall while using Dawn's dash ability because the game didn't plan for it. I'll give that perhaps I was having too much fun with that skill since walking is boring, so most might not run into that problem. Maybe. But since I had to restart multiple times just to continue the game (I even had to take a break at one point), it won't be a game that I'll be 100%ing. I want to, but I can't bring myself to despite it just being a couple more achievements.\n\nStill, I enjoyed the music, especially the opening song, (I'll be keeping that OST, thank you very much.), the voice-acting for the adults (I really liked Johhny), and the alternative dialogue that the game has depending on what you do or don't do. On the other hand, as a character you play alongside for most of the game, Didi was simply too irritating for me; if the game devs were looking for the voice of an annoying child who thinks too highly of herself, they did excellently. The story is predictable if sweet, though I did like the unveiling of the past through collectibles.\n\nGet it during a sale, if you must, but otherwise, I'd say the game is best enjoyed while someone else plays it; there is nothing in the game that I would say needs to be experienced first-hand. If anything, I'd say that the game makes a better show than a game. I had looked forward to some innovative or intricately done shadow mechanics, but it just ended up being disappointing and repetitive which is a shame.\n\nBottom line, I had fun. I enjoyed this game, and I will say that it deserves to be experienced, but not as the player of the game.","May 27, 2015","false","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like most story driven games, I shall begin with the plot and the setting. Both of these strive very well indeed; however, due to the game's short length (roughly four hours for me), the story unravels greatly towards the end. You can see where Compulsion Games were wanting to go with it, but unforunately the developers were told to wrap it up, and it shows in Act III.\n\nIt was disappointing because the noir setting was surperb, and the story soars in Acts I and II. The music and voice acting are top notch. I also loved the idea of Dawn being an imaginary friend and the concept of traveling from the real world to the shadow world.\n\nHowever, the controls in this game is what did it for me. The game is a platformer, which I admit that I am okay at them. Dawn would not stop getting stuck on little things or would pop out the shadow world even when there weren't any conflicting shadows nearby. There were also numerous times in which you should be able to jump onto a simple ledge in the 3D world that was only waist high; however, Dawn would refuse to jump onto it. And due to the game's short length the puzzles weren't that hard to solve. The mouse is what controls your camera angle, and it felt like you had to barely move it or else everything goes haywire.\n\nAll in all, Contrast is a game that had so much potential and soars through the air in the first two Acts. Then, it faceplants in the third act. I did buy this during the Steam Summer, so for just $7.99 (got the soundtrack as well) I did get my money's worth....just wished that there were tighter controls and a longer game length.","June 24, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The execution was fantastic and better than my expectations.\n\nMy only complaint is how short this game was. The ending was a little sudden, and I was left wanting more, at least one more act. I really hope there is a contrast 2 that finishes the story or at least continues it. I think I was offline for maybe half of the game, so the 2.7 hours is not accurate, probably closer to 5-6 hours.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game.","December 15, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a game its nothing special; it would even be fair to say its gameplay is just bad. I often felt as though I tricked trough some levels by takng advantage of the hit-and-miss gameplay like making jumps that would avoid the puzzles. The stories execution is equally questionable, with a protagonist who serves to guide you through the game without any real finesse. And by that I don't mean your character; you seem to serve more as a tool for her tasks but that is the point.\n\nTO THE GOOD!\n\nThis game had a very specific feel about it which I felt made it worth playing. The art style and music marry so well together that I forgave the shaky gameplay (at least for the most part). Depite its dodgy execution, I got what it was trying to show and it made for an enjoyable experience. The story wasn't as linear as what I've come to expect; whether thats a good or bad thing, im not entirely sure. Its fair to say Didi (the young girl) was a bit 'pushy' in trying to force you into the story, but I didnt really mind as my character is there to help her and the interactions of the character felt right for the situation.\n\nTheres plenty to find out beyond the game through exploration. I actually think these bits were what made the game as it added another level of story beyond Didi's life to something more personal for the character Dawn (who never speaks IIRC), also - great name without being something cheesy. I would throughly recommend you endevour to find the 20(I think?) hidden media snippets! It reminded me of Bioshock in that the information you find explains the situation youre in; but in a modest way.\n\nThis game however is by no means difficult! I did the entire story in a single 2 hour sitting and found everything in that time. This wasn't even deliberately to finish it, I just felt like the game never lost traction and felt so, almost, calm to play that I kept casually playing. This isnt to say the story was good; it was weak with the hidden snippets making it interesting but it was solid enough in terms of character and situation.\n\nOverall, as someone who does try to game as much as possible, I can't honestly say its a great game. But for me, it was incredibly playable and I will revisit it again gladly. It was like listening to music, I did indeed just easily loose track of time and do it. I found it quite charming if I'm being honest.\n\nI played it with a controller if that means anything? You wont need the precision or focus of a kb+m but thats just my preference for this game. I would also say if youre on the fence about it, its probably best you wait till a sale comes around. I don't think I paid full price and despite enjoying it, don't know if its worth it. Definately feels like it should be £6.99 or similarly priced. Wouldn't be upset if I did pay retail though.","May 8, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have any liking for French jazz culture, this is the game for you. It is all about using light in creative ways to solve puzzles, most of which are platforming.\n\nMy favorite pieces are the music which was put together with care. The vocalist they hired to sing a couple songs has the perfect voice for this type of jazz. All of the voice acting is quite solid. The other piece that drew me in was the use of shadows to represent characters rather than physical beings. I think that is explained through collectibles, but I haven't spent much time with it. Contrast also manages to portray a sense of innocence surrounding Didi while giving some very adult conflicts when she's not around.\n\nThe only real issue I had was with either the controls or the design, I'm not sure. Sometimes when something seemed easy to accomplish, like a jump, you'd be force off the wall for some reason and have to start over. Basically I think some of the shadows in the environment were unintentional and created surprise blocks for you to avoid. It could also just be I'm not very practiced at platformers. The puzzles seem well designed and not too challenging to figure out. After figuring out what needs to be done, you may still need to take a few tries at it before succeeding, but it isn't usually too frustrating.\n\nIt is quite a short game if you figure out the puzzles quickly, it took me maybe 6 hours. So I probably wouldn't buy it for full price just because of the length, but I would definitely buy it on sale. Also, the soundtrack is a great jazz compilation.\n\nOne last note: at I believe the end of the first act, there are two endings depending on if you just stand and watch, or actively do something (I don't want to give spoilers) If you don't do anything, you'll fail the level and be put back to the beginning of the dialogue, so I recommend just listening first, then actually doing what you're supposed to.","February 12, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a fun game. But way too short. Like the shortest game I've ever played in my life. I just expected a little more story, a little more secrets, a little more wandering, but less cutscenes. you take 7 steps and you get a cutscene, you jump over something, cutscene, Not enough interaction.

It is a game full of character and atmosphere with plenty of fun and extremely creative puzzle-solving missions. The ending is somewhat abrupt at 2 or 3 hours in, and leaves some questions unanswered and open to interpretation, but it is still satisfying while leaving room open for future instalments.\n\nIn short, it could have been polished a bit better, but there's a great gem here full of life and color (despite presenting a world of colorless shadows), and at $15 it's worth every penny.","January 27, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
