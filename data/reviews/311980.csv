The overall premise can be summed as reverse Xcom, you play as an alien force stumbling upon an already habited planet yet seeking to colonize never the less. Starting off with your humble dropship and ten workers, it is your job to survive and thrive in an hostile world. Overall in its inital steam release status, I'd say that Isomer is a very promising game. Currently I feel as though the foundations for a great base building and exploration are present though the content may be too barebones for some. So far I've noticed four diffrent unit classes, a wide array of generated structures for the player to explore and various different building blocks for the player to use. However the selection of middle and late game structures don't seem to be implemented. For example you can build your base to the extent of its layout with lights and lifts to different floors, but there are no doors present in the game nor any sizeable modules and things to fill up these rooms apart from soils to contain reasources.\nCheck out my Let's Play below!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7VcA1f11R8","July 11, 2014","true","5.9"," 47 of 59 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","47","59","0","0"

Things aren't polished, there's a lot of features that we hope to see included, and control limitations take a little getting used to, but it functions, and it's fun.  You play the aliens, invading from another planet, you fight humans, who are also invading from another planet, I guess.  Gather resources, build your base, trade up your inventory, explore, and conquer.  Some simple formulas done properly to give you great gameplay value.\n\nNow the game has tutorials: personally I liked it better without them.  I liked being able just to play the game.  You got attacked in your base in the first 2 minutes of game play?  That's the tutorial.  Worked great for me.  Had some questions about what actions you should prioritize, but learning that is the bulk of the enjoyability of this type of strategy game, and it's not hard to figure out by experimentation.  So it's a great game if you actually like to learn while you play games rather than obliviously carrying out instructions and quests.\n\nTone: 4/5 Simple style, kind of cartoony.  I like that.  Night time is even kind of creepy the first couple times.  Kind of like first play through of Minecraft creepy, but less impending doom.  There's even hints of a developing story taking place.  I sure hope that gets implemented more in the future!\n\nPersonal skew: 2/5 I haven't played this type of game in a long time, and cartoon-y-ness doesn't ruin my emersion.  These are pros for me.  Beyond that you still have a stable game that will bring quite a bit of fun if you are into casual strategy.","October 29, 2014","true","34.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Not just because it is ugly rather someone threw togther a UI after a mushroom bender.  I never thought Well of Souls[www.synthetic-reality.com]  would be high art compared to a pay game.\n\nTrash...there is at least 100 isometric games and dozens of kitty-litter sandbox games that are at least half again better on Steam and floating around the net.\n\nIf you pay $2.50 for this, fine buy it.  Otherwise, there are more free and paid games exactly like this that are better.\n","August 17, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 28 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","4","28","0","2"

It's a cool concept for a good price but the dev left without a word with the game only a quarter finished. Most of the time I have logged was spent either trying to figure out what the hell I am supposed to do or leaving the game running after I stormed out of the room when an engineer tunneled in and took out my core. And who makes a game where the only save feature is to quit?  It was a cool idea that do to lazieness and lack of communication, became crap.","June 6","false","110.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
