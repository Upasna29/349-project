The three main points people bring up for why this game is worse than the holocaust are very easily countered and I honestly don't think can really be used as "cons" at all.\n\n1.  Duke Nukem is too sexist.\nThe fact that this complaint actually gains any traction whatsoever is really, REALLY stupid and it kind of pisses me off to some extent. Really? Duke Nukem being sexist? WHAT A HUGE SHOCK! That's the entire point, don't you guys remember? I could understand if you didn't find the jokes funny anymore, but that's not the devs' fault because they aren't any less mature than the ones in Duke Nukem 3D. If you didn't find the jokes funny then you simply grew up and don't find it funny anymore. Duke Nukem games aren't supposed to be some deep observation of the human spirit or the definition of heroics. Duke Nukem games are about guns, boobs and swearing. You get all three of those in this game, if you didn't like them here then you didn't like Duke Nukem 3D either.\n\n2. The graphics are terrible.\nUh, no, they really aren't, especially for 2011. It looks almost as good as Far Cry 2's max settings or even RAGE's high settings, just without DOF. This game looks REALLY good.\n\n3. It wasn't as groundbreaking as Duke Nukem 3D.\nSeriously, guys? Duke Nukem 3D wasn't very "groundbreaking" either. The engine it used had already been used to make Witchhaven and Powerslave (on the PSX and PC, not on the Saturn) and DN3D didn't do anything with the engine that those two games didn't. Another thing I'd like to point out is that Quake came out before this one did, and Quake is an actual fully 3D game, DN3D is still 2.5D. Hell, Marathon came out a full two years earlier and that game's engine stomps BUILD's testicles.\n\nWas it a disappointment? Yeah, of course it was. I was pretty disappointed with Half Life 2 because the violence was somewhat toned down and there weren't nearly as many weapons or enemies to fight. I felt like I waited too long for something that would have more in certain areas but way less in others. Disappointment does not mean horrible, though. Is Half Life 2 terrible? Not in the slightest. Is Duke Nukem Forever as good as Half Life 2? No, it isn't nearly as good. At the same time, though, Duke Nukem 3D isn't way more amazing than Doom 2 or Marathon or Quake or System Shock. All Duke Nukem 3D ever was was an interactive mid 90's action movie. Duke Nukem Forever is the exact same thing, except this one wasn't released in regular theaters and only got distributed through Grindhouse because there's quite a few ♥♥♥♥ here.\n\nI give Duke Nukem 3D 7.5 out of 10 and DNF 7 out of ten.

No. No it is not.\nIs it what we all wanted to be ? No. No it is not.\n\nGearbox lied about many things. They promised us a campaign that is 12-16h long...I managed to beat the game in 9-10h in the HARDEST difficulty setting.\nSo let's start this off by listing some of the biggest cons:\n-The old Duke is hardly "back". The one-liners are all good but there's few of them...Just put on repeat.\n-The levels are all rather linear not "sandboxy". It's basically a corridor shooter.\n-Regenerating health. What were they thinking?!?! That old-school Duke fans from the 90's really want that ? Yea...Logic!\n-2 gun limit. Later patched-raised the limit to 4.\n\nBasically no ammo, armor, health pickups to look for because of the regening hp. Ammo is thrown at you in boss fights so no need to be careful with ammunition anyways...I guess this also explains the linear level design.\nIt all comes down to this: Lazy work! I blame Gearbox for being lazy and doing just a quick moneygrab on a known and over-hyped franchise/character!\nThe game is simplified. You don't really need to think or be extra careful like in the original Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nThe game's still fun tho. Most people who say it's the worse game ever or the worse game of 2011...Those people are full of shait!\nThe game itself runs very well. I didn't encounter any glitches, bugs or crashes during my 15 hours of playing. It can hardly be THE worse game of the year if it's not even broken, right ? I mean...There's so many broken pieces of s***y "games" out there!\nThe game runs well and can be fun! Duke is still Duke and the one-liners take you to a nostalgic trip. Boosting this game up is a joy! All the iconic guns are there and they are and feel amazing! Yes, the game is linear. Yes, you do have health regen and yes, you can only carry 4 guns at once...But as a fan of fun and Duke...I don't really care 'cus the game is still A LOT of fun.\nMost people who hate on it are just dissapointed because they hyped it up so much. Actually if the game would have sandbox areas, no weapon limit and ammo/hp pick-ups, people would still be mad and dissapointed. The game was hyped to a point where Gods themselves wouldn't dare to release it.\n\nImagine gunning through a bunch of aliens while listening to the badass one-liners. Your Devastator runs out of ammo so  you change to your trusty shotgun and keep going...Sounds good ? That's what this game is all about. Duke is still badass and still sounds like one aswell.\n\nIt's not a bad game but it's an over-hyped game. Ignorant people are just too blind to see it. There's a difference between DISSAPOINTMENT and a FAILURE.\nSure the game was dissapointing but it's hardly a bad game because of it.","June 9, 2015","true","17.1"," 230 of 275 people (84%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","84","230","275","10","20"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996760307/recommended/57900/","76561197996760307","Dennis Stamp","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996760307/","106 products in account","I wanted to like Duke Nukem Forever. I really did.\n\nWhen early reviews criticized the game for poor graphics, crude/outdated humour, dumb AI, and linear levels, I gave the game the benefit of the doubt and hoped that the bad reviews stemmed from unrealistic expectations - expectations that were inflated to reflect the 10+ years that the game was supposedly in development for.\n\nHaving spent many, many hours with DNF, I regret to say that the game is indeed a disappointment. It isn't all bad. Aside from inexplicably playing too much like a Halo/COD clone for my liking, I find the game's biggest issue to be the technical problems that have put me in a position to constantly replay the beginning of vehicle-based levels because something about those levels significantly ramps up the extent to which the game locks up/freezes on my computer.\n\nHere is an analysis of the major factors that comprise this game:\n\nPLOT: There is a plot, but it's pretty weak and uninspired. If anything, it gets in the way of the action that this game revolves around since there are instances where you're foreced to wait for NPCs who are blocking your path to stop talking until you can proceed to your next objective. Listening to these NPCs should be optional!\n\nGRAPHICS: For the most part, they look fine for what they are. Duke Forever never aspired to be the graphical successor to Crysis, so it's silly to compare it to such graphically astounding titles. Although the enemies look cool and much more menacing than they did in Duke Nukem 3D, some of the backgrounds seem very bland (i.e. Duke's Hotel) or feature details that stand out as very, very pixelated (i.e. Sunshine reflecting off of the wall of a large barn in the 'Ghost Town' map). The game looks a little too dark and gritty for my liking.\n\nSOUND: The reworked theme song notwithstanding, the game's music is nothing to write home about. The sound effects, on the other hand, are very well done. Jon St. John's voice acting for Duke is superb; it lends the game personality and makes me laugh because it is just as buffoonishly over the top and anachronistic as it was when Duke first started speaking in 1996.\n\nCritics who whine about how dated Duke Nukem comes across in DNF need to get their heads checked. Telling anonymous women to "Shake it, baby!" wasn't politically correct in the mid- to late-90s, but most of those who condemn Duke for continuning to objectify women in a similar fashion in 2011 incorrectly imply that his behaviour was excusable in D3D because it was in-line with the times. It wasn't. Duke was - and remains - a parodic embodiment of sex, drugs, violence, and machismo taken to absurd extremes.\n\nMy favourite element of Duke Nukem Forever is the re-worked Holoduke accessory. Whereas it was conceptually cool but not very practical in Duke Nukem 3D, using it in DNF cloaks you in a Predator-style skin and produces a holographic replica of Duke that messes up his catchphrases. These botched lines ALWAYS crack me up! An added bonus is that the holographic image of Duke is now genuinely distracting to human foes: it moves around and appears to shoot like an actual multiplayer opponent would.\n\nGAME DESIGN: Sadly, DNF's maps are super linear. Whereas levels in D3D could be navigated a multitude of ways and were chock-full of secrets that encouraged and rewarded exploration and taking chances, navigation in Duke Nukem Forever can usually be summed up like this: move into a corridor; defeat all of its enemies; move into the next corridor. Rinse and repeat.\n\nOne of Duke 3D's very best levels - Hollywood Holocaust - was recycled into DNF as a multiplayer-only map. The redone map gives away all of original's secret areas; you literally need do little more than walk or fly around to discover virtually every inch of this map. Now there are no switches to trigger, no walls to blow up, and practically no skill is involved to see everything there is to see. This remade level is a microcosmic representation of what what you get when you compare the spirit of D3D's level design to that of DNF's.\n\nThe game's shooting mechanics are solid, but the weapon, ammunition, and health systems they are closely linked to really detract from my enjoyment of the game. Because the game arbitrarily imposes a low weapon limit, most enemies will become sources of ammo or new weapons once they're slain. Players feel no incentive to fight carefully, conserve ammo, or seek it out in hidden places, because they're practically guaranteed to have an ample arsenal whenever the dust of a skirmish settles. The health system is even worse; Duke's health regenerates over time. You can be completely careless about the way you fight and have the confidence of knowing that you'll come out with 100% health so long as you're patient enough to wait a few seconds before advancing to take on the next batch of enemies.\n\nTo the credit of DNF's developers, they found a creative way of excusing the shift from a traditional health system to one aping that of Halo/COD: It's not Duke's health that gets hurt in battle, but rather, his ego. So long as Duke's over-confident, over-inflated sense of self worth remains above a set threshold, he keeps on going. He doesn't need to pick up health packs; he just needs a few seconds to clear whatever abuse he just withstood from his mind to feel as good as new. I don't like this new system, but I like the logic that went into implementing it into Duke Nukem Forever.\n\nCONTROL: For the most part, the game controls fine. I really only have two gripes about it. First, in-game VoIP Chat is spotty. Whereas I can count on Left 4 Dead to always broadcast my voice when I'm wearing a headset and I have the game configured to read any input from it, I have had mixed results getting others to hear me in DNF. On a more serious note, I recently gave up on playing the game because of a long-standing conflict between some of 2K's titles and Steam: a bug triggered by the Steam Overlay prohibits you from moving around. I have spent considerable time trying to un-do this bug, and have given up - mainly because I have already spent tons and tons of time struggling with a problem that has plagued me since I first started playing the game: Intermittent freezing.\n\nTECHNICAL QUALITY: DNF freezes on me. A LOT. Every time it freezes, the game's window locks up, the sound stutters, and I have to manually launch the task bar and force DNF to abort its operations for my system to be useful again. The freezing symptoms seem to happen at random, but occur a HELL of a lot more frequently when I have to get around by monster truck rather than on foot. Because players are forced to spend the first half of "Ghost Town" zooming around in a truck, I spent way more time loading, aborting, and restarting that section of the game than I would like to admit. It would almost always freeze within 3 seconds of playing the stage, and fiddling with the game's graphical and sound options didn't make a damned bit of difference in terms of reducing the problem.\n\nMy computer's hardware is  more than capable of handling DNF on max settings, yet no game I've attempted to play has handled anywhere as poorly as DNF. My drivers are all up to date. I've tried compatibility modes. I even reluctantly made the switch from Windows 7 to Windows 8, yet not even that resolved the freezing issue.\n\nCONCLUSION: Duke Nukem Forever is not a great game in its own right, but I still enjoyed it enough to want to reach its climax. However, the crippling bugs I outlined not only soured my impression of the game, but convinced me to never, ever spend money on another PC port by publisher 2K Games (The freezing bug also affects Bioshock).\n\nQUICK RECAP: Mostly good graphics. Superb sound. Mediocre music. Lame level design. Servicable plot. Decent AI. Tarnished by regenerating health and low weapon limits. Crippling bugs. Skip it unless you are a die-hard Duke Nukem fan.","November 16, 2014","false","50.4"," 296 of 402 people (74%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","74","296","402","12","26"

The truth is though, 5-10-15-20 years it wouldn't have mattered. The problem here isn't lack of development, it's the direction of the development.\n\nAll the fluff is there though. Playing this game you will never doubt that this is a Duke game. Scantily clad women are everywhere and you will rarely walk more than ten feet between the various pop culture references, jokes and other nonsense. If anything Gearbox deserves some credit for getting that part of the franchise right. The humor is there, the silliness, the crazy. What they got wrong, is the mechanics.\n\nPlaying Duke Nukem Forever is like playing every FPS made in the last 10 years. Gearbox certainly did. They added every cheesy feature the genre has ever experimented with. You got your vehicle sections, your turret sections, your button mashing quick-time events and so on and so forth. Any sense of the fast paced, old school style of FPS that made Duke Nukem 3D the icon it is today is long gone. Instead we have a Duke that's become old and arthritic. This Duke isn't the badass Duke of old. This Duke leans on stamina bars, regenerating health, limited weapon slots, scripted events and linear maps.\n\nInstead of the sprawling maps of Duke 3D, that had you running, jumping, flying and swimming all over the place, looking for secrets and keycards you play through entirely linear and fully scripted sequences and fights you do not allow you to progress until you've killed what the game wants you to kill and listened to whatever irrelevant dialog the game wants you to listen to. The entire experience is slow and dull and there is little to look forward to besides the naked ladies and the occasional proper joke.\n\nDuke Nukem 3D was a masterpiece of adolescent insanity, of old school fast paced shooting, of innovative map design. Duke Nukem Forever has captured the adolescent part but lost everything else in the shuffle. What's left is a mediocre shooter with a bunch of nudes thrown around.\n\nDuke Nukem Forever is not a very good game. It's a game that doesn't stay true to it's old school roots doesn't even compare to the original. Even by modern standards it brings nothing new to the table, just a bunch of rehashed concepts and ideas. Nothing is new, nothing is better than what's been already done.\n\nAll in all. For those that have been waiting, hoping for a good old school style shooter, this ain't it. And for those that just want a decent modern shooter to pass the time, this ain't it either. They might get the crude humor right but everything else, just ain't Duke.","May 24, 2013","false","162.4"," 118 of 158 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","118","158","0","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/57900/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Like a hyper-violent, over-sexed Peter Pan, Duke Nukem refuses to grow up. Though 12 years have passed since the events of Duke Nukem 3D, he's the exact same trash-talking, cigar-chomping, muscle-bound man of action, still rocking that '90s-style buzz cut and red tanktop. The source of his superhuman action-hero powers is his own ego, which doubles as a literal recharging shield over his (also recharging) health. It's reinforced by an entire world of people who worship him as an infallible man-god and sex idol—women want him, men want to be him. He's the stereotypical teenage boy's power fantasy personified and turned up to 11. Sure, he's a ham-fisted action hero parody, but Duke remains one of the most memorable characters in gaming history for a reason: he's simply more fun to play as than SERIOUS FACE ARMY MAN.\n\nAs two-dimensional as Duke himself, the story gets right to the point: intergalactic sex-criminal aliens are re-offending, and Duke must defy orders and step in to defend Earth's chicks. Even that flimsy B-movie tribute plot is resolved (sort of) half way through—DNF becomes simply about shooting aliens 'cause they're ugly, and bits of the script are little more than profane Mad Libs. Lazy writing or pointed critique of the state of story in first-person shooters? I prefer to think of it as the latter.\n\nAction-wise, the single-player game fulfills its obligations as a successor to Duke Nukem 3D. It's fast-paced run-and-gun battle against diverse, love-to-hate 'em monsters, using weaponry ranging from conventional boomsticks toover-the-top sci-fi, and fought through a long series of corridor levels where there's almost always something unique to see and interact with. Almost every original weapon (except Duke's boot) returns—and after taking the Shrink Ray and Freeze Beam for a spin, it makes me wonder why few shooters have appropriated the joy of killing enemies in two-step attacks. Sure, shrinking enemies and then squashing them or freezing and shattering isn't as efficient as double-tapping to the head, but it's more fun. There's also the Devastator, a ridiculously powerful, double-barreled, rapid-fire rocket launcher that never pauses to reload until it's spent.\n\nDuke's trusty pistol, shotgun, Ripper chaingun, and rocket launcher may not be anything particularly unique or special (and certainly not realistic, lacking even a hint of recoil) but they're loud and potent alien killers. The new weapons, a rail gun sniper rifle, an alien laser, and a triple-missile-launcher called the Enforcer Gun are pretty ho-hum—no new classics here. The biggest sadness is that DNF has adopted the Halo-style two-weapon system, which frequently forced me to abandon my beloved Shrink Ray for lack of ammo. Even with all of that heavy weaponry, I still died quite a bit—despite the regenerating health system, Duke Nukem Forever is one of the more challen­ging shooters I've played in years.\n\nAt least the signature remote-detonating pipe bombs, laser tripwire mines, and Holo-Duke decoys (plus melee-enhancing steroids and pain-mitigating beer powerups) exist outside this limitation, allowing you to set all manner of devious traps in the diverse range of linear, corridor-style levels and lure enemies into them. Duke battles the aliens through his high-tech Duke Cave, his self-styled opulent casino, the aliens' disgustingly organic hive (complete with Prey-style sphincter doors that open when tickled), a Vegas skyscraper, a Dukeburger restaurant, Hoover Dam, construction sites, Nevada canyons, underwater, and more.\n\nThe old-style design is probably due to the fact that DNF should've come out years ago. (Hell, 2K's recommended PC is built from five-year-old hardware.) Here and there, it shows; while alien monsters look pretty cool—particularly the iconic Pig Cops and flying, tentacled Octabrains—humans and many of the environments look well behind the curve. But thanks to the aliens' comical massacre of EDF (Earth Defense Force) troops, you don't spend a lot of time looking at people, so it only really offends when the incompetent President waves his unarticulated fingers in your face.\n\nPop culture references are similarly out-of-date—even growing moldy. Considering that the freshest ones I caught date back all the way to 2004's Team America: World Police (excluding reenactment of Christian Bale's 2009 meltdown in the opening and a crack at Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare tacked on at the end), most of Duke's one-liners were probably recorded in the early half of last decade. Though Duke still delivers several chuckles per level by quoting '90s films like Pulp Fiction and Starship Troopers and jabbing at Halo, it's noticeable that he's been living under a rock for quite some time.\n\nThe most innovative puzzle gimmick is shrinking Duke down to a few inches tall and sending you scurrying through levels made for man-sized play. Being action-figure sized gives you a new and interesting perspective on the world—jumping around a vast kitchen battling rats and mini Pig Cops among the shelves while using mustard jars as cover is a very different experience, and one encounter in particular makes an epic battle of what would normally be a one-shot kill. However, running any significant distance on tiny legs can get tedious.\n\nAction is also varied up with frequent turret-shooting scenes, most of which are thankfully short and punchy, and two separate driving sequences: one as mini-Duke in an RC car, one in an oversized monster truck. Both are longer than they probably should be, as the uncharacteristic lack of guns on Duke's cars limits you to repeatedly running over enemies and turbo-boosting over jump after jump.\n\nOne category in which DNF has surpassed its predecessor by leaps and bounds is in its uncensored nudity, particularly in the first half. Breasts abound, some attached to shapely but dead-eyed ladies, some to other, less appealing things. If that kind of thing bothers you, you've probably already been warned away by the long-as-your-arm ESRB rap sheet—but my personal taste threshold was exceeded only once, by a mid-game incident that goes just a little too far in mixing boobs, comedy, and gore.\n\nOther points of pain are the checkpoint-only save system, which is at least courteous enough to only rarely respawn me farther from the point of death than I'd have liked, and mercifully brief quick-time events—mostly just tapping Space bar for feats of strength.\n\nDNF is a throwback to the age when shooters were long single-player experiences first and multiplayer games second, and as such the eight-player multiplayer modes aren't going to challenge Call of Duty or Battlefield for the competitive crown. It's often hilariously effective at showing us a good time, though—the 10 maps, which are diversely designed with the same wide range of locations as the campaign, are built to create goofy and memorable moments when combined with Duke's weapons.\n\nIt's a healthy chunk of game, too. The Steam clock read “10 hours played” when I'd finished the single-player run on normal difficulty, and that's without devoting time to posting a high score on the pinball machine or conducting a thorough search for secrets. Completing the game unlocks classic, why-doesn't-anyone-do-this-anymore cheats like character head scaling, and I might have to replay at least part of it just to see that absurdity in action.\n\nI'm sure that years of anticipation will spoil Duke Nukem Forever for some—there's no getting around that at the end of that long road is only a good game and not an amazing one. It is what it is. He may not be at the top of his game, but even after all this time, Duke still knows how to party.\n\nRecommended Despite All The Hate It Gets\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 9, 2014","true","12.8"," 181 of 260 people (70%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","70","181","260","35","3"

Well, when DNF was released in the early summer of 2011 it was probably one of the most hated games i've ever seen released.\n\nThe game had some serious issues. It didn't feel like Duke Nukem 3D, it was slower, it had a 2 weapon limit, the graphics were rather poor and reminded me of something you'd have seen prior to DOOM 3, the bosses were lame bulletsponges and contained qte's and so on.\n\nYet still i happen to like this game.\n\n"Why?" you might ask, the reason is simple.

Due to this fact, many of the original ideas planned for the game didn't make it to the final product as can be seen in its many trailers.\n\nBut then, when all hope was lost (with 3D Realms closing) Gearbox appeared and saved the day buying the Duke Nukem license. And then the game was released. Was it groundbreaking? No. Was it awesome? I wish... Was it bad? No, and that's what it's important.\n\nIf you don't know the history of its development, the final product (at least the bulk of it, not counting the makeup and multiplayer Gearbox added later) was finished by 2009, and due to budget and legal problems, the game felt a little old even for that time. So probably most of its ideas were nice and new for 2005 maybe, its not bad! But not as impactating as they wish they were (if they decided to change it, it probably would have never been released).\n\nPlot wise, it isn't something jaw dropping, it is something you would expect from a Duke Nukem game: Duke is loved and desired by the women, men admire him, and kids want to be like him, it's all going well until an alien mothership comes to Earth. The problem is, they're not being hostile... yet. As the story unfolds (doesn't take too long actually) everybody finds out that the aliens plan on abducting the women, and kill everyone else, ESPECIALLY Duke Nukem, so it's up to the King to go rescue the babes and save the world once again.\n\nGraphically, it isn't outstanding by any means, but Gearbox did a really good job poilishing it, the blur and depth of filed effects are really well implemented. You can notice a few low res texture here and there (most noticeable on the console versions) but it shines at times like in the Cycloid Emperor fight at the start of the game or in the Mothership battle a bit alter on. What really is kinda of ugly, it's the animations, the characters move unnaturally and don't have many facial expressions, reminded of Quake 4 NPCs. On the other hand, the enemies are very detailed and in general really well done.\n\nIn the Sound department, it lacks a more compelling soundtrack, but the voice acting is really well done, Jon St. John returns as Duke doing a really great job. The other NPCs sound a little ridiculous sometimes, but that's intended. The one-liners return and (fortunately for me and unfortunately for others) the old ones come back too. There aren't many good ones within the introduced in this game, but some really have the spirit of the franchise.\n\nGameplay was one of the most controversial things about this game, I thought it was too linear run and gun with regenerative health (ego) as most FPS games are nowadays, and that's what disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to play, but I expected it to be more open ended like Duke 3D. I was hoping for something that would really differ (in a good way) from all the games we have today. There are puzzles here and there and I enjoyed them, to reduce the pace a little to not get too repetitive. The other games references were funny and not offensive like most people think they were, Duke Nukem 3D featured a "dead space marine.." (Duke's voice) and played just like it, guys at Id found it hilarious and not offensive, it's more of a homage than an offense. The guns for the most part don't feel very powerful (with the exception of the shotgun), and the classic funny ones can't be used as they were in Duke 3D because of the 2 weapon limit (4 as an option with a later released patch), the Shrink Ray is overpowered, since it's almost One Shot One Kill, but the Freeze-Ray is underpowered because it takes a lot of time to actually freeze the enemy and puts you in harm's way since it only works in close range.\nThe loading times aren't as huge on the PC as they are on the console versions, but it is still a little big when you are dying constantly in a specific part of the game. You can't save whenever you want, instead the game uses checkpoints, which actually makes the game more challenging (too much at times but oh well).\n\nMultiplayer is old school. Features deathmatch, team deathmatch, CTF (CT Babe in this case), and King of The Hill. All old school fast paced, not many people play it, but its fun for a while. Weird that when any player dies, they blow up instead of having ragdolls, probably because the guys at Gearbox didn't have time to implement it.\n\nAs a game released these days, I'll give it a 6, which is fair, it shares a lot of similarities to other popular FPS games these days (including the complaints). But knowing that it was supposed to be released a long time ago (talking of the actual build, not the old ones), when the ideas were actually "new" for the time, I would give it a 7.8. I think that after all that the developers been through, they deserve a little understanding.","January 26, 2014","true","39.6"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","50","63","0","0"

It was all over 'the promise that was made 12 years ago' was finally going to be fulfilled. So people got excited, suddenly people that didn't even know Duke Nukem became a Duke Nukem fan just to be on the 'Hype Train' by knowing the game took 12 years to develope they skyrocketted their expectations, what wasn't known was that The Game Company actually went bankrupt in the process of the making of the game and had to postpone it.\nEven in the game you can see in what conditions they developed the game.

The gameplay is mediocre, unsatisfying and generally not fun. There's no exploration in the levels, no secrets and nothing beyond linearity. The weapons handle badly and are limited to a two or four weapon limit, but the levels have all been designed with a two-weapon limit in mind, which means no ammo and the mandatory use of some weapons in certain sections. The game wastes its energy with a poorly written, poorly thought out story that shouldn't even be there. The graphics are horrid and the post-processing (which is the only way to make it look decent) will ruin your eyesight. Seriously. The multiplayer isn't much to write home about, either - it's based on the singleplayer so you have the same terrible weapons, and the level design is generally pretty awful.\n\nThe fact that Gearbox considered this fit for release tells you volumes about what sort of developer they are. And the fact that 3D Realms went from a perfectly great game ready for release in 2007-2008, to spend even more time and money to port this game to consoles, redoing all the levels and mechanics so it'd play best on an Xbox, tells you much about how this game ended up taking over 14 years in development. If you can get it for cheap, give it a try, but keep in mind that this is Duke in name only.","May 13","false","35.1"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","34","46","0","13"

Of course not, don't be ridiculous. How could any game possibly be worth waiting 14 years for, especially one that only ever aspired to be a low-brow comedy first-person shooter? There's no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur. More than anything, Duke just wants to party like it's 1997.\n\nCheck unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers before you even consider buying this suddenly corporeal ghost of PC gaming history. The development-time-to-awesomeness ratio isn't impressive. If you can do that, Duke Nukem Forever can at least mostly succeed in its aspiration. After all of its tumultuous history, it's ended up as an entertaining FPS wrapped in juvenile, smut-laced humor. Its gameplay is a hybrid of old-school and new, and it won't wow players with stunning visuals—its window of opportunity for that passed years ago—but it does put on a good show of alien ♥♥♥-kicking by working what it's got.\n\nThe Cycloid is one of the cooler-looking bosses, but his bark is worse than his bite.\nLike a hyper-violent, over-sexed Peter Pan, Duke Nukem refuses to grow up. Though 12 years have passed since the events of Duke Nukem 3D, he's the exact same trash-talking, cigar-chomping, muscle-bound man of action, still rocking that '90s-style buzz cut and red tanktop. The source of his superhuman action-hero powers is his own ego, which doubles as a literal recharging shield over his (also recharging) health. It's reinforced by an entire world of people who worship him as an infallible man-god and sex idol—women want him, men want to be him. He's the stereotypical teenage boy's power fantasy personified and turned up to 11. Sure, he's a ham-fisted action hero parody, but Duke remains one of the most memorable characters in gaming history for a reason: he's simply more fun to play as than SERIOUS FACE ARMY MAN.\n\nAs two-dimensional as Duke himself, the story gets right to the point: intergalactic sex-criminal aliens are re-offending, and Duke must defy orders and step in to defend Earth's chicks. Even that flimsy B-movie tribute plot is resolved (sort of) half way through—DNF becomes simply about shooting aliens 'cause they're ugly, and bits of the script are little more than profane Mad Libs. Lazy writing or pointed critique of the state of story in first-person shooters? I prefer to think of it as the latter.\n\nIncoming canned goods!\nReloaded\n\nAction-wise, the single-player game fulfills its obligations as a successor to Duke Nukem 3D. It's fast-paced run-and-gun battle against diverse, love-to-hate 'em monsters, using weaponry ranging from conventional boomsticks toover-the-top sci-fi, and fought through a long series of corridor levels where there's almost always something unique to see and interact with. Almost every original weapon (except Duke's boot) returns—and after taking the Shrink Ray and Freeze Beam for a spin, it makes me wonder why few shooters have appropriated the joy of killing enemies in two-step attacks. Sure, shrinking enemies and then squashing them or freezing and shattering isn't as efficient as double-tapping to the head, but it's more fun. There's also the Devastator, a ridiculously powerful, double-barreled, rapid-fire rocket launcher that never pauses to reload until it's spent.\n\nI just want to be looooooved!\nDuke's trusty pistol, shotgun, Ripper chaingun, and rocket launcher may not be anything particularly unique or special (and certainly not realistic, lacking even a hint of recoil) but they're loud and potent alien killers. The new weapons, a rail gun sniper rifle, an alien laser, and a triple-missile-launcher called the Enforcer Gun are pretty ho-hum—no new classics here. The biggest sadness is that DNF has adopted the Halo-style two-weapon system, which frequently forced me to abandon my beloved Shrink Ray for lack of ammo. Even with all of that heavy weaponry, I still died quite a bit—despite the regenerating health system, Duke Nukem Forever is one of the more challen­ging shooters I've played in years.\n\nAt least the signature remote-detonating pipe bombs, laser tripwire mines, and Holo-Duke decoys (plus melee-enhancing steroids and pain-mitigating beer powerups) exist outside this limitation, allowing you to set all manner of devious traps in the diverse range of linear, corridor-style levels and lure enemies into them. Duke battles the aliens through his high-tech Duke Cave, his self-styled opulent casino, the aliens' disgustingly organic hive (complete with Prey-style sphincter doors that open when tickled), a Vegas skyscraper, a Dukeburger restaurant, Hoover Dam, construction sites, Nevada canyons, underwater, and more.\n\nThis little piggy is coming for blood.\nOh yeah, and there's a shameless strip club level with no combat—it's mostly a showcase for boobs and a playground for the many interactive games (pinball, air hockey, billiards, video poker) and gross-out moments in the bathroom. No two settings are alike, and with plenty of Easter eggs scattered around that boost your health when interacted with, exploring the world is a frequently rewarding high point.\n\nBlast from the past\n\nAt the end of these levels lie some old-school-tough boss battles. Almost all of the hulking beasts took me out at least once before I figured out and exploited their attack patterns (notable exception: the final boss). Fights against a mothership, a massive alien queen, an underwater leech, and others are more about the spectacle of fighting huge unique monsters (plus an excuse for Duke to nut-punch something for an ego boost) than creating interesting gameplay.\n\nIt's Duke vs. Goliath.\nThe old-style design is probably due to the fact that DNF should've come out years ago. (Hell, 2K's recommended PC is built from five-year-old hardware.) Here and there, it shows; while alien monsters look pretty cool—particularly the iconic Pig Cops and flying, tentacled Octabrains—humans and many of the environments look well behind the curve. But thanks to the aliens' comical massacre of EDF (Earth Defense Force) troops, you don't spend a lot of time looking at people, so it only really offends when the incompetent President waves his unarticulated fingers in your face.\n\nPop culture references are similarly out-of-date—even growing moldy. Considering that the freshest ones I caught date back all the way to 2004's Team America: World Police (excluding reenactment of Christian Bale's 2009 meltdown in the opening and a crack at Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare tacked on at the end), most of Duke's one-liners were probably recorded in the early half of last decade. Though Duke still delivers several chuckles per level by quoting '90s films like Pulp Fiction and Starship Troopers and jabbing at Halo, it's noticeable that he's been living under a rock for quite some time.\n\nEh, it's Vegas. They were probably going to tear that hotel down and build a bigger one anyway.\nMeatheaded\n\nI encountered a lot more puzzles (of the jumping, physics, and switch-throwing varieties) than I'd expected, and few are befitting of Duke. Dropping barrels into one end of a shipping container to tilt it and create a ramp is too mundane a task for a super badass—Duke's not making fun of the puzzles other shooters started using a decade ago here, he's imitating them. Poorly.\n\nThe more innovative puzzle gimmick is shrinking Duke down to a few inches tall and sending you scurrying through levels made for man-sized play. Being action-figure sized gives you a new and interesting perspective on the world—jumping around a vast kitchen battling rats and mini Pig Cops among the shelves while using mustard jars as cover is a very different experience, and one encounter in particular makes an epic battle of what would normally be a one-shot kill. However, running any significant distance on tiny legs can get tedious.\n\n80/100","January 29","true","2.8"," 47 of 70 people (67%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","67","47","70","7","0"

Why? Because you fight hordes of space aliens that blows up just right under your assault,and it's good fun to realize that any gun is good, not only rifles or RPG's.This means that you can actually carry your golden pistol the whole game because it's that useful\n\nFor a current-gen game,Duke falls short.But for an experience coming straight from the past, it's a blast to play.I wouldn't say it's a must-buy,but definitly a rent. And bring friends along,you'll laugh until the credit rolls\n\nIf you were a real Duke fan back in 1996, you will love Duke Nukem Forever.","June 23, 2011","true",""," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The game attempts to reference Duke Nukem's past, and they do an alright job of it. The storyline itself is rather longish, with different puzzles, interactive scenes and boss fights to keep you occupied along the way, The voice acting could have used more work (especially the way they made Duke Nukem generally sound), and even though the storyline is longish it still seems like once you've finished the game it was too short.\n\nThe DLC "The Doctor Who Cloned Me" gave the game a bit of a boost along with it's nearly dead but still alive multiplayer community. These two should give you a bit more gaming time. I would recommend getting this game when it's on sale because the normal price to buy it is currently too much in my opinion for what this game offers. Hardcore Duke Nukem fans would probably enjoy this very much, but younger gamers or gamers that are not familiar with the Duke Nukem series would not understand the raunchy references this game makes or the style of humor that Duke Nukem has always used.\n\nOverall, this game on sale + the DLC and multiplayer would be pretty fun for a casual gamer to play. There are also many references to other games that came out around the time that Duke Nukem Forever came out; casual gamers would definitely enjoy that.","June 27, 2014","true","26.8"," 55 of 91 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","55","91","0","0"

For those that have been living under a rock the past... decade, DNF is a game that has been promised, over-hyped and even killed off and brought back from the dead for YEARS with hundreds of thousands of avid fans from all over the world hoping and praying for its eventual release. Did this game live up to all the hype from delay after delay? (Did Colonial Marines?) I think the general consensus is "NO." but even with that in mind, lets take a look at the game and see what it's got going for it.\n\nDuke Nukem Forever is the long awaited sequel to the FPS Classic Duke Nukem 3D. It has all the crude humor, over the top violence, and macho-man attitude its predecessor is known for, but its lacking some things that helped previous titles become hits: Charisma. This game might have the violence and T&A the series is known for, but is lacking in charisma, class and not to mention the humor is far too low brow (even for a duke nukem game) to be funny. Now, at times it does have its funny and witty moments (driving around in a remote controlled car for example) but these moments are too few and far between, not to mention the level design can be incredibly frustrating and even dull at times. There is a multiplayer aspect to the game, but it's the most bare-bones pathetic excuse for multiplayer that nobody wants to play it, and speaking of multiplayer, this game made the ultimate sin of NOT HAVING CO-OPERATIVE GAMEPLAY. Many people wanted to like this game, but its makes itself very hard to like, is that dukes fault? No. If i had to put the blame on anything, its remaking the game too many damn times. The original trailers for the game looked nothing like this, and honestly, probably would have been better. But who knows? The companies responsible sure as hell didnt.\n\nPROS:\n> Duke is back\n> Delicious Uncensored Boobs\n> Customizable Penthouse\n> Occasional fun\n\nCONS:\n> Multiplayer is horrible\n> No Coop\n> Incredibly low-brow humor\n> Confusing level design\n> Waiting 15 years for a lukewarm game\n> Unrewarding gameplay\n> Far too expensive for price of admission\n> Only a deranged individual could like the infamous "Hive Level"\n\nVERDICT: Bargain Bin.\nBOTTOM LINE: This game should be sold for $5 and thats the end of it, this game isnt worth full price, never was, never will be, and no amount of apology can excuse what this turned into, we can only hope that this isnt the end for Duke and that he'll find his way into a better, funnier game in the future. Go buy Duke Nukem 3D. 3/10 Not Recommended.","January 27, 2014","false","22.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

I picked this one up really late because honestly I avoided it a lot, and after all this time, after the dust has settled, lets just see how this game truly is.\n\nFirst of all, prior to writing this review I decided to investigate a bit in the 15 years it took this game to be developed and the whopping 20-30 milion dollars invested in this (Wikipedia source: While the game neared completion, the funding began to dry up. Having spent more than $20 million of their own money, Broussard and Miller asked Take-Two for $6 million to complete the game. According to Broussard and Miller, Take-Two initially agreed, but then only offered $2.5 million. Take-Two maintained that they offered $2.5 million up front and another $2.5 million on completion. Broussard rejected the counteroffer, and on May 6, 2009, suspended all development.")\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥. All that money, all that hype, all the promise, all those expectations....all for nothing.\n\nDuke Nukem Forever starts things off fairly sily, with the endgame boss battle from D3D recreated here, the game starts you off in your penthouse doing...nothing. It starts out guns blazing, fighting the Cycloid Emperor, but then things start to slow down, drasticaly. Why? Wtf. Also, the first joke in the game, literally the first line of the game is the only funny one "After twelve ♥♥♥♥ing years it better be good". They knew they ♥♥♥♥ed up. They ♥♥♥♥ed up so royaly they could never, ever live up to the hype and expectations. Especially with a game that looks and plays like this. This is the main problem, this is what SUCKS. You start the game, walking like a jackass, looking at backgrounds that look so ♥♥♥♥ing horrible, even the 2001 demo had a better looking Las Vegas, you wait for people to move out of the way, listen through boring dialogue, you walk, you walk, you wait for the President to talk to you about some ♥♥♥♥ that you don't care anyway, you punch a few aliens and FINALLY you get a gun. Wow, talk about a slow start, about 30-40 minutes without any action. And after the "action" kick in, you realize something. Hey, wait a minute, why do the guns feel so lame? Why don't enemies react better to my shots? Why is there such a low ammo cap? Why am I regenerating health? Why is there NO GOOD MUSIC IN THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME? AND WHY IN THE HOLY MOTHER OF ♥♥♥♥ AM I DOING PLATFORMING AND DRIVING SEQUENCES IN A ♥♥♥♥ING DUKE NUKEM GAME? No, there is no excuse for this mess. No wonder 3D Realms collapsed after this, they invested 20 milion dollars in a game that was announced in 1997, 1998, 2001, 2007 and released in 2011. They ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their fans. "When it's done" ♥♥♥♥ you, seriously, worst thing about this whole fiasco is that Duke Nukem is probably DEAD FOREVER. This may have been the final nail in the coffin. But I could rant about this for hours and for pages, let's just break things down into what I enjoyed and what I disliked and give it a personal rating.\n\nThe good:\nInteractive enviroment\nFairly decent alien design\nThe shotgun is really fun to use\nSome, not all Duke jokes are "fun" to say the leastThat's it, I can't think of more, honestly.\n\nThe bad:\nRecycled jokes/enemies,guns - No real new additions to the formula\nLinear corridor levels set on predetermined paths\nVisuals that represent the original release date planned for 2006-2007\nLong, boring and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ platforming, driving and puzzle solving sections that drag on way too long\nLack of variation with enemy ecounters\nLame boss battles\nLimited ammo cap\nRegenerating health\n♥♥♥♥ plot\n♥♥♥♥ voice acting(aside from Duke)\n0 enviromental story telling, 0 characters to be remembered\nLack of a kick ♥♥♥ soundtrack\nBoring overall to playFor the 6 bucks I spent on this, through all the frustrating moments, this game is downright Boring to play. It's just not worth it, I had to try it out for myself to see exactly all it's flaws, but man, does it suck big time. No reedeming factors here. I was expecting a bit more fan service to say the least, but nope. It's just a linear, ♥♥♥♥♥♥, corridor shooter that makes fun of other "modern games" but plays exactly like one. The irony is amazing. ♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ 3D Realms, ♥♥♥♥ Gearbox and ♥♥♥♥ this game. 3/10","March 25, 2015","false","7.9"," 75 of 133 people (56%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","56","75","133","14","3"

Apogee Software was once a great MS-DOS Company that I miss so much, their once inovation of DOS Classics via BBS became a tragedy in all of Gaming History.\n\nIf this game was released back in 1998, Apogee Software would have continued proudly.

And then, Gearbox stepped in to save the day in 2011 by completing and Releasing Duke Nukem Forever. We all thought that Duke Nukem would never see the light of day. So, I agree with Gearbox: "Duke Nukem Can't Die". And so, thanks to Gearbox & 3D Realms, Duke Nukem is back from my MS-DOS Childhood Days to Next-Generation HD & he is here to stay!\n\nAnyway, Duke Nukem's got more One-Liners, Weapons and more Cool Features than You can ever ask for.

The 2001 trailer showed that there were some awesome ideas in the making...\n\nEventually I think we all knew the game was rushed just to get it done. Nothing that made Duke3D so awesome is left. There is a lack of humor, color and only in the first few levels will you find some useless interactive stuff. What's left is a very boring shooter that was released way passed it's expiration date when it comes to graphics and gameplay. There's only a handfull of different enemies and the "you killed everything" sound makes it quite obvious that you're safe for now, and that's just boring. Then there's the obvious console-targetted menus and controls. This was once supposed to become another epic PC shooter to mock all the standard boring shooters... instead DNF became a boring shooter itself.\n\nThe story sucks, the graphics are mediocre at best for a 2011 game, the gameplay sucks and there's nearly no Duke-humor.

A game that, somehow, survived perpetual delay limbo. As a game by itself, it's not worth the price of admission. It brings nothing new to the table, serving more as a small tour through popular genres that evolved through the decade of development, from its release. As a Duke Nukem game, maybe. Given the lack of actual games between this and Duke Nukem 3D, besides spin-offs, it's potentially worth for a bit of modern nostalgia. Though, such reasoning is rather fleeting, as its gameplay mechanics contrast the seemingly dated theme to try and seem modern, which drags itself down significantly.\n\nIf you're fond of Duke Nukem enough that you need a fix, go nuts, but pick it up on a sale. For anyone new to the character an story...

I had heard the game was terrible and, as I didn't want to ruin the nostalgia that I felt for Duke Nukem, I decided that I was going to avoid this title.  I was so, so wrong to judge this game before experiencing it first hand.\n\nThe game may not be perfect, but it is definitely fun.  I found it to be as enjoyable as any first person shooter that has been released in the last few years.  Duke is back in all of his glory and the gunplay is a blast.  His crude one-liners are more than welcome after the decade plus that I've waited for a worthy return and I found myself laughing frequently.\n\nThe mechanics of the game run flawlessly.  I didn't experience a single issue the entire time I played and the aiming and character controls are top notch.  Every single death and missed shot in the game felt like it was 100% my fault and not some aspect that was overlooked by the developer.  Another aspect of the game that I enjoyed was that, although the number of weapons to be found is about on par with the other games, all of the remained viable throughout the game.  They all have their pros and cons that you can use to your advantage for each situation that you find yourself in.  It also should be mentioned that, unlike the vast majority of FPS games out there, the game never felt monotonous to me.  One moment you'll be running and gunning, the next you'll be platforming after being shrunk down to the size of a can of soup, and the next you'll be manning a turret as hordes of alien ships and reinforments are en route to kill you.\n\nThere are two parts of Duke Nukem Forever that keep it from being an absolute gem, however.  First, is the restriction on the number of guns that you can carry.  Duke Nukem used to be a walking arsenal.  Every weapon that you found in the game you kept for the rest of your campaign and could use it at any time as long as you had the ammunition for it.  The second improvement to the game that could have made it a classic would be the vehicle controls.  Driving Duke's monster truck, while fun to run over aliens with, was a bit more of a hassle than I would have liked.  It wasn't absolutely terrible but it was enough that I was less than excited when I saw it ahead of me and knew that I would be driving instead of running and gunning which I would have preferred.  Fortunately, you don't spend very much time in it.\n\nI recommend this game to any first person shooter fans and especially to old Duke Nukem fans.  I had a blast and played it from start to finish in about ten hours over the course of four days.  This -is- the worthy successor to Duke Nukem that I had hoped it to be and I had to get the word out about my experience!","December 23, 2015","true","10.0"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sok4R/recommended/57900/","Sok4R","Sok4R","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sok4R/","877 products in account","Duke Nukem Forever ist probably best know for its development history: after numerous changes of engines, faked trailers, a long silence and a lawsuite, Gearbox Software (today probably best known for the Borderlands games), finished the game. It was probably not the best for their reputation as the game is average through and through. Die graphics is roughly on the same level as Half-Life 2, without the great systems for animations and facial expressions. It follows the blueprint of a classic first person shooter, which includes puzzles in the levels whch are all well done. The rest ist mostly standard fps level design, only in very few instances the genius level design which made Duke3D a masterpiece shines through. I noticed that quite a lot of arenas are in the game, where the player is trapped and has to defend multiple waves of enemies. The weapons are part standards like a pistol and a shotgun and part crazy weapons like the ice- and shrinkray, but nothing that veterans of Duke3D aren't familar with. But they are not as effective (or should I say: overpowered?) as their counterparts in the predessesor. Since only four weapons can be equipped at the same time (two if the option is deactivated), I decided not go for the exotic weapons but more for the standards to be prepared for most situations. The number of emeny types is quite low, also mostly well known foes. But their behaviour has change quite a bit, making them a new challenge. But some more different ones would have been good. The driving stages are no highlight as especially the buggy with its huge tires is a agile as a rubber boat. The game has though bossfights, which range from very good like the one against the alien queen (which does not only require fast fingers but a bit of thought) to average like the one against the Octaking.\nBut that can be the summary for the whole game: nothing is really bad, but the highlights are far and few, making the whole game quite average.

Exploration is non existant there is only one path if you deviate away and find some alternative way like see a little hole drop in (like seriously 2ft deep) die, instantly. Huge gripe, TURRET SECTIONS I really dont think anybody enjoys these and this game has alot of them. Has mouse accelerate or something on, the mouse reacts too much and isnt very accurate, playing with the settings helps but it still doesnt fix the over compensation, PC versions of games really should do away with those settings I think they only annoy people like myself.\n\nIt does have some redeeming quality's the humor is bang on the mark for Duke, i liked the ego system somewhat but its not quite the same as say having secrets they are always infront of you and you'll find you just click anything you can 'use' to see if it gives you ego, most of the weapons are fairly lame but there are a few like the shrink ray and the triple shot rocket launcher thing.\nIt has alot of mini games you can take a go of but that doesnt interest me, i came for Duke not to play pinball.\nIt has alot of variety in levels but in most cases its tedious and annoying, the driving parts are really mind numbing like the casino shrink part it loses its novelty really quick, then your using your pick-up truck to get to various places along the linear path and it just gets really annoying.\nSome of the puzzles arent too bad.\n\nWould I recommend it? as a game no, if it didnt have Duke Nukem in the title it would have tanked hard, the selling point here is in the brand name. A bland FPS with honestly not that much shooting in parts, alot of turret sections and completely on rails action from the get-go with a few tedious mini-games.\n\nHowever if your after a trip down memory lane with Duke and some of his classic humor it may be worth the price tag when its on 75% off, i bought it on 75% off, i didnt feel ripped off i got a few hours out of it but i really did have to force myself to play it out, very mind numbing game.\n\nOverall score 3.5/10","January 26, 2014","false","8.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There aren't many new guns that are worth using *three new ones in total i think* and really the only one thats good is like some alien sniper rifle which doesnt really fit Duke's personality.It's very linear and they didn't even bother to hide it, or maybe they did but screwed up. The little mini-Game like things you do to gain more ego are cool at first but get boring after a while do to lack of creativity with them *one of them being....wall boobs?*. The boss battles are pretty anti climatic as you always have infite ammo lying around in an ammo crate and they always supply you with a rocket launcher or an explosive weapon,because thats the only thing you can use against them,except for one where you use a mounted minigun that for some reason Duke Nukem cant tear off.There arent any secrets lying around that will help you, i mean whats the point when ammo is lying around everywhere. The 2 weapon thing is in this game which i hope dies off in FPSs soon. The multiplayer isn't that great either. You all play as Duke on red team or blue team with the only differences are some shirt colors and hats that make you look stupid. The multiplayer is the same as most MMS multiplayer modes with the shrink ray and freeze ray changing up a bit.

This is not the game anyone hoped for or wanted.\nThe game should have been buried along with 3d realms. Duke Nukem Forever\nis not fun, it is not entertaining. The gameplay is actually awful, the combat is\nembarrassing. I love Duke Nukem 3d, it is a phenomenal game. It was revolutionary\na triumph for the first person shooter genre. This game ♥♥♥♥♥ on his memory and\nno matter how much you love Duke Nukem, you will be hard pressed to try\nto enjoy this new entry into a franchise that should have died with fondness\nand in the accolades of PC gaming.\n\nSadly gearbox decided to cash in on the hopes and 12 years? Of hype behind\nthe fabled “Vaporware” title DNF. It should have been buried along time ago, this\ngame is not fun, it is not funny. There is nothing here for anyone. The highlight\nof my 10 hour playthrough (second to hardest difficulty) which was absolute\ntorture throughout. Was microwaving a rat, that was about it. In addition to about\n3 new quips from John Saint John (voice of Duke) that made me smile, there is\nnothing here.\n\nJust buy Duke Nukem 3d Atomic edition, that is what you want. There is even\nan HD pack widely available for the game now so it doesn’t look THAT awful.\nSo buy that instead of this waste of hard drive/virtual space.\n\nAvoid like the black plague.\n2/10","February 24","false","10.9"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","22","40","0","1"

Duke Nukem Forever is not the super duper trainwreck people say it is.\n\nBut is it a fantastic game?: No, no its not that eather.\n-------------------------------------------------------\nFor a game so long in development, there is no doubt Duke Nukem Forever is underwhelming and far below the content we expected and should have received. But if you take off your DN3D tinted glasses and come in with a "low budget, cheap" game mindset, you'll actually find its decently enjoable, enough to atleast warrent 1 playthrough.\n\nThe game IS plauged with flaws, again its not exactly perfect, but at the end of the day though: its Duke Nukem. If you want more of his cheesy, politically incorrect personality, he's here and just as amusing as it was in DN3D. It'll satisfy you.\n\nI won't lie. I really did enjoy Duke Nukem Forever, and for the longest time i felt like one of the few people on the planet who did. I can accept why people won't like this game, and i agree with most reasions. But if you put yourself in a proper mindset, you'll find something fun about it.\n\nDon't EVER buy at full price. But do pick it up on sale if you want more Duke.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smkabish/recommended/57900/","smkabish","DeadCrescendo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smkabish/","573 products in account","First off, my credentials:\n\nI first played Duke Nukem in the form of Duke Nukem 2 Shareware on my AST Advantage 386mhz computer running on MS-DOS and Windows 3.1, shortly after, I went to spend the night at a friends house - he had "Duke Nukem 3D", It was a shooting game he said, like Wolfenstein 3D or Blake Stone, but better. With ♥♥♥♥ and explosions.\n\nWell being that was just reaching puberty this sounded wonderful. I was hooked, like everyone who played DN3D I was a fan for life. To this day I can go back and enjoy it the same as I did on day one. But this isn't about DN3D, this is about Duke Nukem Forever. And the introduction is the base problem.\n\nI just drowned in nostalgia over Duke, and expected a game in development hell for over a ♥♥♥♥ing decade was going to be anything similar. I didn't just buy Duke Nukem Forever, I pre-ordered. I spent a whopping amount of money on the initial release on console, (Xbox 360), only to be greeted with a two weapon limit, dodgy graphics and horrible load times that made Gen 1 PS1 games look fast. It was awful.\n\nI sold Duke Nukem Forever soon after reaching the "Octaking" boss, but was gifted the game and DLC by a long time friend who wanted to make sure "I gave it a fair shot"\n\nHe was right.\n\nThe PC version of DNF is substantially better. Does this mean it's a great game? No. It's not. But it's something many games fail to be these days. Fun. It's a good game. Not great. Good. It's like 7 dollar 4 hour porno DVDs you buy from the gas station with a pack of jerky and a six pack. You know it's not going to be the prettiest or cleanest thing, but you get your fun out of it and you didn't have to spend a lot.\n\nIf Duke Nukem Forever had been released in it's current form with DLC for a lower price point no one would be complaining as much as they are. But first impressions are everything. And I can honestly say - yeah. I hated it when it came out. I hated the turret sections (Though, I like the monster truck, Gearbox driving is never a bad time) I hated the attempts to out-edge the original Duke Humor (The twins are just outright cringe worthy). Shadow Warrior is a much better example of how to update a classic FPS to the modern day. Same with Rise of the Triad. I just feel like Duke Nukem got too big for it's britches.\n\nIf I were to rate the original game, no DLC, no patches. It's a 1/10. Easily. It's up there with ♥♥♥♥ games like Cosmic Race or Bubsy 3D.\n\nBut the PC version, with improved textures and lighting, better weapon capacity, and overall a more pleasant experience? It's a 6/10.\n\nI recommend Duke Nukem Forever for the sheer fact that it's a lesson in how not to develop a game. Passing it off to a bunch of people like a Thai ladyboy at a bachelor party to whoever wants to take a shot at it next. In the end we're all left a little dirtier and devoid a few bucks. But we had a good time in the process.\n\n","February 27","true","8.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Let's find out with this late review.\n\nDuke Nukem Forever is not a bad game as everyone says, but it's not good. I see what they wanted to try, I really do, bring back the good 'ol classic shooter game 1999 style. But let's focus on the good things before and then let's point out the problems.\n\nThe game itself doesen't even look so bad, the textures are really good, and the graphic it's good looking, and can run smooth even on not-so-great pcs with high settings.\nThe gameplay it's fun.. for most of the time; there are many weapons, from the classic pistol to the weird alien ones. Not a lot of renovations of gameplay, and not everyone of them are actually good. Why does game desingers think that water level where you can drown are fun to play?\nThe game it's pretty long, and haves a lot of different locations. The map desing it's pretty good looking, but it's mostly a hallway for most of the game, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it, I never had problem with invisible walls, but here I couldn't reach almost nothing becouse of them. Jeez.\n\nAnyway, can't think of anything else. Let's focus on the problems.\nAs I said, this game is a straight up line, expecially at the beginning. The enemies aren't so much difficult to kill, and fortunatly the power ups are hard to find.\nThey added cars, but that didn't help much. Seriously, a monster truck? What am I, 6 years old?\nThe Humor it's terrible: maybe it's just me, but an alien with 3 boobs on his chests just gross me out. It seriously looks like the humor of Saints Row, stupid, childish and immature, and I hate it. But it had a few funny moments.\n\nI don't wanna waste more time finding all the little problems, but I just wanna point this out: this game doesen't have the main thing: it can't be 100% Duke nukem. For lot of parts I was feeling like playing another game; I don't know if they was references, probably yes, but lot of stuff was like ripped off from Doom 3, Half Life 2, Halo and for god sake, even Call of Duty. Easter eggs or not, that doesen't make the impression of a original game.\n\nFinal Score: 5+/10 for effort.\nAnd mostly understanding. 12 years in the making, 3 different games developers's houses.\n\nAt least it wasn't so much glitchy. And some boss battles where actually interesting.","January 28, 2014","false","13.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Duke is the main man and he doesn't deal with weapon limites.\n\nMistake #2: Ego Health. Completely changes the dynamics of the game. The orignal health and armor was good for\nbuilding the tension in the game. Ego bar... run, dodge and hide until you health comes back. (Anyways that\nego bar plus weapon limits makes him feel more like Halo and Duke is too cool for that.)\n\nMistake #3: Half of Duke's items. No more reusable health packs? No more jet packs?! No more scuba gear?!?\nNo more protective boots!!!! Half of Duke's cool toys are gone...\n\nThese might seem to be minor but add it all up and Duke is missing a cornerstone that made him so cool but they did do some things right in this game too. Too bad it wasn't enough to forgive the first three sins.\n\nPlus 1 - Duke Nukem Forever retains the look of a Duke Nukem game looking a hundred times better.\n\nPlus 2 - Duke keeps his orignal voice with it's orignal humor. Without that trademark now it wouldn't be a Nukem game.\n\nPlus 3 - Duke retains his naughty ladies in the game except now in high res.\n\nPlus 4 - His enemies never looked so good at being bad.\n\nNow you are saying that the positives outnumber the mistakes. Realize my friend that those three basic mistakes completely change the dynamics and play of the game from Duke Nukem Meltdown that all the hard-core fans loved. Duke Nukem Forever only has a familiar face and voice of Duke but with the changes feels more like Master Chef or Chief or whatever that Halo character name is. Problem is it feels more like Halo than Nukem and as big as the Duke Nukem fan base was, lots of us were miffed to say the least. Personally I think Duke Nukem would of been better of doing Meltdown as a Retro Game than what they made with Forever. On a seperate note though, as miffed as I was at Nukem Forever, given time I got over my anger and like Duke Nukem too much to even let go of this sad excuse of a Nukem game. On that note I barely recommend this game but only because I find it hard to part with any Nukem game, even badly made ones.","July 21, 2015","true","7.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

That said, it's an ugly game that cribs from other shooters without any understanding of why certain things work and why they don't... Rather than allowing puzzles to function as a break from action, it interrupts them for more tedious "here's two enemies, now here's two more, rinse, lather and repeat" action. The "execution to restore life" idea never pays off because the player never knows if they'll actually get to perform an execution unless they get the freeze weapon... And though they finally included an option to increase the stupid two-weapon limit to four, the player is still going to end up mostly using the weapons that ammo is actually provided for on a given level. The "interactive" elements, like pinball tables and computers, mostly serve to try to distract from the obvious narrow linearity of the levels (and fail to do so). The humor is flat and off-putting, drawing an irate "you thought I would laugh at THAT?" from the player. The use of ugly green dark-vision through much of the game suggests a lack of confidence in the work of the texture artists. And perhaps worst of all for those who fondly remember Duke Nukem 3D, this iteration of Duke is a wuss... Drunk on one beer, constantly having to run for cover in every encounter, and departing more than one major fight flat on his back and passing out. I understand why some people might feel compelled to bear witness to the train wreck when the game is available at a sale price, but honestly... Spare yourself the time and go watch some of the video reviews of DNF online instead; there's probably a lot more genuine entertainment value to be found there.","January 26, 2014","false","15.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Duke Nukem Forever was a blast to play! Everything from the strip club mini-games to the hardcore gunning action to the anti-air missions. For those of you who aren't familiar with the textbook case of "Development Hell", Duke Nukem Forver was a sequel planned almost immediately on the heels of its acclaimed predecessor, Duke Nukem 3D. Unfortunately, stuff happened, legal stuff happened, and a game was spat out around 2011. After seeing bits and snippets and reading up on some negative reviews, I finally bought it and played and, like I said, LOVED IT! Duke Nukem, having accumulated fame, fortune and everything else (a casino, a restaurant franchise, a strip club, etc.) from saving the Earth, gets his mood ruined when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aliens show up with less than diplomatic intentions. Duke Nukem has aspects of the Gears of War, HALO, Doom 3 and every other big name shooter instilled into its mechanics and is peppered with mini-games on the side (some pointless, some cool, some kinky), all the while staying true to its original origins of one-liners, violence, machismo and BABES. The mechanics were smooth, the gameplay was a little hard but not too hard, the graphics were beautiful, the weapon selections was great and the setup for everything was beautiful. So why did it get negative reviews? Not sure, but if I had to nitpick what may have been wrong with it, I'd say it was a little too linear. It had a very clear plot and story that the player has little choice but to follow along with. It's reminiscent of games like (2006 sleeper) Prey and Bulletstorm in this sense. Aside from that, it's everything you'd expect from a Duke Nukem sequel, so give it an honest try. It'll be in the bargain bin for the rest of its days, so what have you got to lose?!","April 2, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MercuryCrusader/recommended/57900/","MercuryCrusader","WAR!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MercuryCrusader/","507 products in account","Alright, I'm re-reviewing this. As somebody who has put 36 hours into the game and has gotten every single achievement for it, including the DLC stuff, I am fully qualified to make the most correct review of the game.\n\nPros: -\n\nCons: Duke Nukem Forever is like playing the history of first-person shooters, specifically the decade leading up to Duke Nukem Forever's release. Shades of Half-Life 1 and 2, Halo, Call of Duty, any game-changing FPS, all thrown into this game. Unforunately, it's all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aspects of those games lazily mashed into an extremely boring and forgettable title. Limited amount of weapons on hand? Halo. Chest-high walls and cover shooting? Call of Duty. Physics puzzles and platforming? Half-Life 1/2. Level design that consists of linear hallways and the absence of exploration? Call of Duty. Vehicle segments? Half-Life 2 and Halo. Triggered events that play out when you reach certain parts of stages? Call of Duty and Half-Life 2. A lot of interactive environment fluff such as operating a microwave? Half-Life. Pipe bombs (grenades) and melee being a separate button? Call of Duty and Halo. Regenerating health? Call of Duty and Halo. Unskippable NPC dialog you have to listen to for story reasons before you can progress? Half-Life 1/2. I can go on and on. The game is a mish-mash of several concepts that first-person shooters have used as the genre evolved, and yet the game impliments them poorly. Nothing in the game is original, it's all borrowed ideas, the brainchild of George Broussard playing other video games and deciding to shove their original ideas into his game without wondering if it'll make Duke Nukem Forever better because of it. The writing is just as terrible and half-♥♥♥♥♥ as the rest of the game, which fluctuates between having outdated humor, stilted dialog, and occasional bouts of eerie misogyny that tries poorly to pass as jokes. The story is so disjointed that it feels like each chapter was written 2 years after the previous one, and it carries over to the level progression, where you jump from one environment to the next with no logical explaination as to why you are where you are now. And the gunplay wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't deliberately cribbed from Call of Duty wholesale, and with pacing even worse than Half-Life 2. Do you like walking down hallways, occasionally having to solve a physics puzzle, and then once you reach a room full of chest-high walls to use for cover, a bunch of aliens show up and you shoot it out with them, and then repeat your hallway/physics puzzle progression onto the next shootout? Because that makes up a good chunk of the game. And when they try to break it up with vehicle segments, they are, at minimum, twice as long as any vehicle segment in Half-Life 2, and with the same progression flow of "drive to obstacle, get out of vehicle, shoot enemies until you get obstacle removal item, drive to next obstacle" that Half-Life 2 had. Nothing in this game is original. It's all cribbed from better games, executed poorly, and you'll wish you were playing any of the other games it was ripping off instead. Or maybe you'll be burned so bad that you won't even want to play another first-person shooter again.\n\nOther: I bet on Duke. And you don't welch on a bet. I made a promise that I would 100% Duke Nukem Forever if it ever came out. And it did, and I made good on it. I wanted to stop playing it, but I kept pushing on. I learned a lot about why the game is bad. And I hope I can educate others into why it is bad.\n\nF\n\nA lot of people can say Duke Nukem Forever is a bad game, and it is. But when you dig deeper into the game, you realize why it is a bad game. Not just a poorly-made video game. It's a poorly-made, unoriginal, boring mish-mash of complete ♥♥♥♥. Duke Nukem Forever is literally the embodiment of all the worst parts of the first-person shooter genre shoved into the most banal, boring game to ever be given a decent budget.","July 21, 2013","false","35.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

Back in the 90s most of us fell in love with Duke 3D. Not for its movie cliches or paying women for money, but for its non linear levels with a lot of exploration and guns. Well Duke Forever took away the non linear level design. Now Duke is stuck in some one dimensional levels. You'll visit the desert, a damn, a bar, an alien hive, his underground complex, get shrunk in a Duke Burger all on your journey to a tower. Duke isn't as fast as he used to be, so now he has vehicles every so often. You'll sit on and drive remote controlled cars and a giant monster truck that squashes enemies and uses nitrous boost for the jumps.\n\nI think my issue with this game is the first two hours felt like everything but first person shooting. The game throws a lot of distractions at you. An interactive museum dedicated to Duke, punching, playing pinball, driving, first person platforming and a turret section. It just seemed like the shooting was 15% of what Duke Forever was.\n\nOnce you get over the giant hill of the first two hours, the game feels like a Half Life 2-ish game and that's good. Duke's world has been taken over by aliens. If it didn't sound Half-Life 2 enough for you, Duke walks and drives his way to a massive tower with a beam of light extending to the sky. There is a checkpoint system and no exploration or secrets. There are a few simple physics puzzles here and there. Moving barrels to weigh things down. Stuff like that.\n\nThe game uses a typical Unreal / Gearbox with controls to thumbstick crouch, thumbstick sprint (forward only), weapon switch, grenade, trip mine, zoom aim, fire, melee, jump and actions / reload. There are quick D-pad controls for Duke's night vision, holovision (duke clone to distract enemies), steroids and beer.\n\nYou can only carry 2 weapons and switch between them. There is a good variety of weapons. A laser sighted pistol, alien laser, shotgun, triple barreled ripper machinegun, rail gun to snipe, RPG, chaingun, devastator, freeze ray, triple stinger missile launcher, trip mines, grenades and so on. Nothing feels like it has impact.\n\nThe enemy intelligence is pretty good. Berserker pigs will charge, pig soldiers will shoot at you, and if you hide, they will grenade you. Alien soldiers hover, teleport in and out and actually try to flank you. It makes for a nice dynamic. The only problem is a lot of the maps are so straight forward, they don't allow for being flanked. The boss fights are pretty easy and that's not a complaint. Just RPG them until they're low on health, run to them and uh button mash them to death.\n\nOther enemies from the franchise make their return. Octobrains swim, hover and shoot projectiles at you. Preginators jump and face stick onto you so you'll need to button mash to take them off. Hovering assault commanders that fire missiles at you. Overall, it seems like there aren't that many enemies, just different versions of them.\n\nThere are a few sections that confine you to an area and just have enemies flood in. It feels like a cheap way to extend gameplay, even if it does highlight enemy intelligence. Some enemy rooms are so simple that you see the enemy dropping in, so you can be there to shoot them point blank, taking away any kind of challenge or fun.\n\nIf this game wasn't Duke, I would have kept playing to realize there is an enjoyable game here past the first 2 hours.","April 2, 2014","false","14.9"," 32 of 61 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","32","61","0","0"

By Lucifer's beard, this is not the worst game of 2011, but the worst game of our lifetime!

Duke Nukem Forever begins with the best of intentions, and the first hour or so is actually moderately entertaining. But in short order, what begins as a dead average first-person shooter degenerates into a series of platform jumping puzzles with little in the way of actual combat or action between them. A drought of weapons simply highlights the fact that this game is a shooter in name only. Progression means enduring one stale problem-solving exercise after another, occasionally punctuated by a horrible boss fight. By the time you realize that these aren't just intermittent elements but are in reality the entire game, you think you've sunk in enough time already and that the game will be over soon, so you press on. But the game doesn't end. It plods on so ridiculously far past the point where an ending would have been a welcome reprieve and only becomes less bearable as the player's patience wears thinner and thinner. For sure, Duke Nukem Forever earns a lot of scorn simply because as a long-awaited entry to an otherwise great franchise, it fell far short of lofty expectations. But the game is horrible even when you try to set it aside from its predecessors and analyze it on its own precious few merits. The fact that this frustrating, disjointed abortion probably killed an otherwise good series off only adds a slightly superficial complaint to a long list of valid reasons to hate Duke Nukem Forever with the intensity of a thousand suns.","December 13, 2013","false","14.8"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

They try WAY too hard to the point seems phony, contrived. Makes you want to puke.\n-Duke in Duke 3D was bad-♥♥♥ and offensive but in a "kick-butt/chew bubblegum way". Here, he is such an A-hole and uncool, you wish he would die.\n-Too many linear "scripted" levels incuding mind-crushing monotany and boredom\n-Cheating computer AI, cheating boss-fights, and super-lame "jumping puzzles" (I thought we grew out of that in the 90s????)\n-Weapons waaay to underpowered.

I assume if it wasn't we might have seen the return of the 'mighty foot' as an actual action - though it only returns as a suped up mega-truck.\n\nAnother thing I sort of disliked was the fact that the game felt too much like Half Life or Portal - I didn't come to play this game for the puzzles with a side of alien killing now.

Another Gearbox game that is not Borderlands where you are a marine from some space colony and must fight aliens (except most of the time, you fight other humans).\n2.

That is how much you should pay for this game (or maybe less than a burger).\n\nThis game isn't GOTY material like these games where:\n1. You are Troy Baker and must defend Ellen Page from zomb-, er, people on mushrooms.\n2. You are Troy Baker and must protect Ken Levine's daughter from the internet (or otherwise Ken Levine will cry).\n3. You are not Troy Baker and have gone home to some house in 1995 without enemies or puzzles and and will probably leave in 2 hours (or speedrun the whole thing in minutes).\n\nOnce you realize that DNF is a bit more old-school than your modern FPS and come to accept that this game has no dog, what you'll find is a okay, average, generic game that doesn't do anything revolutionary or unique but can be fun nonetheless.\n\nI only recommend this game because there are far worse games you could play than Duke Nukem Forever, like:\n1. Another Gearbox game that is not Borderlands where you are a marine from some space colony and must fight aliens (except most of the time, you fight other humans).\n2. A game where you control rodents who are bad and do horrible things to cats.\n3. A game where you are a biker on a ride to hell, which consists of riding from hell in a ring road with no way out.\n\nWhat's the worse that could happen if you play Duke Nukem Forever during a Steam sale, in which case it's the price of a "greasy hamburger" you'll finish in 5 minutes anyway?

Many reviewers over exaggerated this game's terribleness. The reality is that with nearly 13 years of hype, I can't say I blame them though. Duke Nukem Forever is an "okay" game. It's no 5 star blockbuster like everyone wanted, and it's sure as hell not the pile of trash people are claiming it is. The gameplay is "okay", there's nothing special to it appart from the item system featuring cans of beer and steroids. Graphically, this game is horribly outdated; games from 2008 looked better than this. The story is terrible but then again, it's Duke Nukem; were you really expecting Metal Gear Solid quality story telling? The game's only saving grace is Duke Nukem himself. He's a loveable character even in these tough times. Spewing out silly one liners and owning a business empire centered around himself has made him even cooler.Jon St. John returns once again to play the voice of Duke and as always does an amazing job at portraying him. Now that the initial wave of hate has passed over, I can safely say that this game is worth giving a try if it's on sale or if one of your buddies own it.","August 11, 2013","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Duke Nukem 3D helped shape the FPS genre. It's totally fair to say Duke Nukem Forever had some serious shoes to fill.\n\nYou have no idea how much I ♥♥♥♥ing wanted to love this game.\n\nI badly wanted, nay, badly needed to love this game! and the good news - it is a fun game. In parts.\n\nThe game opens with you replaying the classic 1996 Football field Boss Fight. As the one liners start flowing I breathe a sigh of relief. it's clear they haven't missed the mark too much, but this leads to one of Duken Nukem Forevers' core problems.\n\nIt hasn't advanced much at all since the 90's.\n\nMaybe this was the point you may say, but I don't think so. Duke pokes fun at moderns shooters then uses features taken directly from them, such as an Unlimited regenerating health pool and only being able to carry two weapons at any given time.\n\nYou can't take the ♥♥♥♥ out of a game then directly use features from it.\n\nAt it's core Duken Nukem Forever is an old school run and gun game. The levels have little coherence and could just as easily be a selection of random events that Duke comes into shooting and shouting one liners.\n\nThere are good parts, the combat is entertaining and has a 'classic' feel, the weapons are fun to use (even with overly large models) there are lots naked women, Duke ripping aliens heads off, Ball punching, Beer drinking, and crude humor that the child in me did enjoy.\n\nHuge mini boss encounters are also fun but then you are soon back to some filler moment, when all you really want to do is blow up more aliens with a Rocket launcher.\n\nTo it's credit this game has no cut scenes. everything happens through the eyes of Duke. This is important, and I'd like to see more of this 'Half Life' approach in other FPS's.\n\nThe really bad moments in the game come from a driving level, broken up with a pointless "Oh no I've run out of gas" moment... and horrible and unavoidable control a shooting turret sections, mixed wioth lots of filler moments.\n\nYou have no idea how much I ♥♥♥♥ing wanted to love this game.\nDuke - it's great to have you back, but this isn't the game we deserved.","January 30, 2013","false","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

He is, and always will be our beloved hero. For starters, and even newcomers who never have seen duke before, there will be some real problems here. We all know what it means. Duke back on 96 was the blast. And now we are seeing something awful, but, to newcomers, that are used to BF 3 or COD, with all those grapics and so, well, don't expect something so "good shape lookin".\nThis game does not features the best graphics ever, and does not have the same freedom you had in 96. Yup, that's true. But keep in mind you are playing duke nukem. People play this game for it's gameplay, and for the fun. It's nice to ride cars, something impossible in 96, or even have some new weapons. Of course the game is not perfect, but we have Duke, and he makes the game better.\nAll the dlc's and the game core are pretty nice, and you are always going to have some good moments with friends in MP. Yes, there are not many players there, but, we the little number of players there are good persons, mostly nice persons with true gamer spirit, not like the community from L4D or TF2, with mic spam or trolls every now and then.\nRemember that if you are here because you are a Duke fan, you will be in the perfect place. And if you are not, and think the game is bad... Well, give it a try, and instead of looking for the "bad" things on the game, take a good ride with a monster truck, dismember someone with the shotgun, melee kill someone and kick all the alien asses on the way. That's the spirit.\nSo, depite all the things the haters say, give it a look for yourself, and if you think nooe is there to play mp, well...

But not only that there were constant engine changes too not to mention the directors constant editional features wanting to be added. It's still an all time great game and I've played from the first to the last, I think now that they've gone past Duke Nukem Forever. They'll now be able to focus on a game with no ties or commitments to make the Duke game that was ment to be played by the start. Many people complaining duke is an out dated character. I actually don't think so, Tomb Raider went through many different body shapes and features. So I think it's only fair that Duke gets the same treatment. Sure the game was a flop due to the graphical blops and limited gameplay features, Without a doubt it's still a funny, fun action packed full blown american in your face game with an epic character to boost. Long live the duke may he return back to our screens again for another adventure!","July 4, 2014","true","17.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its a game development story that almost makes it necessary to play the game, heck - should I get a kid interested in playing games, I'll make sure he/she plays this. Not for the game itself, but for what it represents (Older duke games included in the "must play" of course).\n\nBut in regards of the game, we get a completely decent experience with a decent amount of content. It features a large variety of stuff, the good old duke comments (more or less liked pending on your view) and it is a nice play through. Biggest letdown was the 2 guns carry limit, but other than that I had my fun and felt that I got my moneys worth - even though I pre-ordered it and as such got it along with all the hype.\n\nBiggest shame is that 3DRealms didn't manage to release this themselves, they had a lot of it done and I cannot help, but wonder what went wrong. This game marks the end of a special era in video game history, before it became incredibly commercialized and big money. The whole way of doing business as 3Drealms was unique and I feel somewhat saddened looking at their website now and remembering what could have been if they hadn't spent 12 years on a title they ultimately never finished themselves. Its a darn shame, but Duke Nukem Forever will always represent the spirit of the old - though more in name than in game.\n\nBuy it, play it and consider what it went through. Its a slide down in memory, that features multiple roadbumps, but its a slide worth taking in my opinion.\n\nIf you got/get it on sale, then you have a nice deal of a game :)","August 31, 2014","true","18.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Most game reviewers gave it a 50  for numerous reasons , such as mediocre level design,  adding nothing new to the genre , and my favorite one to discuss , , duke's attitude.  Yes people, stupid game reviewers actually blasted DNF because duke acted more like duke than he ever did before .  Mysoginistic ?  not really imo, male shovanistic, definitely.  insulting to gays , women , or any one that wasn't a strait alpha male .. most definitely it is duke after all.  does that magically make the game less fun .. no.  on the average the reviewers were right about the level design , most of it is a bit mediocre  but many parts jump out as sheer classic fun . If you loved the original duke , and you arnt shy about humor , give this game a try.

Stop getting hyped people, expect what you can expect, not what you think the trailer promises or what you would like to see in the game.\n\nOf course, this game is far from perfect and doesn't even come close to what it could have been, but in the end, it's a new Duke Nukem game and I, for one, am happy it's here. It's Duke Nukem. Stop comparing the game to similar titles because similar titles do NOT have Duke Nukem.

Put in a bunch of zero-@ssed internet jokes that any autistic intern could have gathered in an afternoon. The internet isn't funny. We've all seen every meme ever "Created" i.e slapped together on imgflip or quickmeme in .9 seconds, at least 6,000 times. They were funny one time. One.\n\n2. Slap in some obligatory attempts at crude humor like picking up poop, drawing a d1ck with a marker, or attempts at being "misogynistic" like having two girls blow Duke while he plays his own video game.\n\nEven if you ignore the absolute lack of soul of personality that went into the humor itself,  Duke Nukem Forever was a boring, uncreative piece of ♥♥♥♥ game whose best moment was in a video game parody of the franchise itself which took place before the game even started. DNF was nothing but a Frankenstein's monster of mishmashed gaming concepts which had proven popular in the years and years the game spent in development limbo - with GOOD games. Like Counter-Strike, or Half-Life, or Halo. The vehicle segments were buggy and boring. The combat was braindead. The Duke quips were 14 years out of place. The levels were uninspired, as was the level progression, and the game's one true callback to the original was a juvenile level full of alien anuses that eventually resulted in a three titted alien who took zero effort whatsoever to kill. There weren't even strip clubs or nudey mags, and the captured human women were irrelevant.\n\nThe fact that this game has 67% positive reviews would be amazing, if it weren't simply more proof that gamers have no taste or sense. It has no playability, and that's a stretch to say it even had playability the first time.","June 3","false","32.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I expected a Duke Nukem game. I didn't get either.\n\nI've always been a Duke Nukem 3D fan because it was my first game I've ever played. I've played countless hours of DN3D through the years and was finally hyped for DNF. I've preordered DNF and even thought about getting myself the Balls Of Steel Edition. I've counted every day, hour and minute for its release. When it was finally released, nothing else in the world did matter.\n\nI finished the game in just ONE sitting, in the hardest setting. Got 60% of the achievements in one swoop. I wasn't even rushing, I was taking my time to enjoy the game. I was dazed and confused. What went wrong?\n\nWell, I got it down what went wrong AS A DUKE NUKEM GAME:\n\n- The game offers no challenge whatsoever. Everything feels easy.\n- I could only use two guns per time. TWO guns. Screw you, you're only holding 2 guns at a time.\n- The game is linear. No keycards, no switches, nothing. Just straight forward.\n- No puzzles. I only got like one or two of these and they weren't memorable. You won't be spending your time with them.\n- The level design is just awful. As I said, the game is a corridor, so don't expect those rooms and layers you're used to on a normal Duke Nukem game.\n- The soundtrack didn't seem fitting. I miss that bassy MIDI songs.\n- Health recovery like CoD or Halo games killed 50% of the fun. You won't be begging for medikits, you just get behind a cover and wait.\n- Gun impact felt bland. Gunplay was very dull.\n- Shooting sections feel cheap. They lock the room and throw enemies at you. That's pretty much it.\n\nAnd what went right:\n\n+ I like the new guns.\n+ Multiplayer was a fun mode but it was condemned since day one.\n+ It's Duke Nukem. He's that guy full of one liners and wrong jokes.\n\n\nBut that's about it. Duke Nukem Forever feels and plays like a unfinished and unpolished game. It feels like a beta through the whole game.

As a result, when I first decided to play Duke Nukem Forever (a game which was released 20 years after Castlevania IV) I expected to see the same innovative ideas. To my shock (and horror) I discovered that Duke Nukem Forever does not feature 8 directional-whips, in fact, Duke Nukem Forever doesn't have whips at all! This was most disappointing because I was really looking forward to whipping in 16 different directions but maybe 20 years isn't enough to create digital whips that whip in that many directions.\n\nWhereas Castlevania IV has the player advance through various themed (and spooky) stages until you arrive at Dracula's Lair and defeat him in a climactic end to the only good Castlevania game, Duke Nukem Forever has you save American pornstars from Kotaku writers. Personally I think that saving the world from Dracula is more important than saving American pornstars but I am not a cis-gendered feminist so what do I know.\n\nIn conclusion I would recommend Super Duke Nukem IV over Castlevania Forever because there are a lot of innuendos and sexual jokes about ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and those are my favourite types of jokes.","December 9, 2012","false","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

There are noticable weird stuff like monsters ragdolling after being shot and stuff like that. And - yeah, it's cheesy as hell.\n\nBut the thing is - it's Duke Nukem. He is a badass, he has his trademark one-liners, he knows who he is. And it just feels good to be a badass. It feels good to be Duke Nukem, to just kill everything with some ridiculous guns. And what I like most about this game - is that it's not serious, and it knows it. God dammit, those aliens steal and impregnate our women - how the hell is that supposed to be serious?\n\nAnd for this - I like this game. It kinda even feels like old Duke Nukem (well, compared to modern "military simulators"). Many people would disagree - but I enjoyed this game. It's great, and if you can ignore first 30 minutes of "what the hell?" - you may probably like it too.","January 8, 2015","true","8.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The 4 weapon system is fine with me, since borderlands also did 4 weapons. Most bosses have to be taken down by explosives and turrets. No mighty boot, but you can smack your enemies with your gun. The handgun, shotgun and railgun are my favorite weapons. The game is split in killing all the enemies, puzzles, driving, and boss fights.\n\nMultiplayer is corrupted with hackers, but there are some good runs. Multiplayer is also corrupted with toxic people, (Alessio/Frau Blucher) that point at people of being hackers just because they got killed once. He would then leave the game, and load his hacks and come back to be a jerk. Living in North America, the servers are mostly laggy (~200 ping) because most of the players are from Sweden or Austrailia.\n\nYou can level up in multiplayer which upgrades your dig, do challenges and unlock wearable items. You unlock chicks in your dig when you can talk to. Challenges are best way imo to level up, stuff like "Kill X amounts of players with Y gun" or " Run X miles." You can customize your Duke in multiplayer with the wearing items i.e. 3D glasses, headphones, and others.","March 13","true","254.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is fun, it is sarcastic, it is women, beer, and boobie magizines.. But then again most of the kids now-a-days probably don't even remember when there were boobie magizines.

That is me trying to be as objective as possible. The game was in development for years and drove it's parent company 3D Realms completely out of business. I followed it like a hawk and was extremely disappointed with what little Gearbox did to it.\n\nDuke Nukem Forever has a lot of flaws and many people incorrectly assume it's because "Duke Nukem is outdated". Infact if this game had been a Serious Sam style old school first person shooter, I would be defending it til the day I die. That is not what this game is at all. It has all the outdated elements of Duke Nukem 3D along with a lot of modern concessions. While the game does implement new elements to the design they tend to fall flat. You have new weapons you don't use, new quotes you don't enjoy and new elements you dislike. What we get is regenerating health, and a two weapon limit. Yes Duke needs to hide behind cover and stop feeling depressed when he gets shot.\n\nThe game is certainly not unplayable, fully patched it runs at a stable framerate with FOV options. Since it's an U3 game it generally shouldn't have too many bugs. It's just not the game we wanted and that's what utterly kills me with it. It doesn't appeal to new players and it alienates old ones.\n\nI actually feel the one thing Gearbox could have done to fix all this was to add modding support to the game. Duke Nukem 3D had a very large map editing community that still survives to this day. Fans could have created their own Duke Nukem Forever in it's former glory.","May 16, 2013","false","2.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The real tragedy is the mouse control - forced mouse acceleration even when disabled in the menus, mouse stuttering for no apparent reason. These really ruin the experience for me, and as someone who really prefers to play FPS games with mouse/keyboard it's almost unplayable.

No offense to anyone, but I personally think that games like Halo and Call of Duty can NEVER live up to this degree of awesome!\n\nUnlike most FPS games of today, DNF strives to be original and interesting. There was never a moment where I was bored or uninterested, the game was action packed, hilarious, and all around entertaining from beginning to end. It was even more fun than Duke Nukem 3D, and that's really saying something too!\n\nUnlike these so called "critics" who complain about everything, I can honestly say that I can find ABSOLUTELY NOTHING major wrong with the game! Sure the storyline is simple, the graphics are outdated, and the game is slightly perverted, but everyone seems to have forgotten one crucial fact, THIS IS DUKE NUKEM! and when you play a DN game you're not out to embark on a emotional, heart-wrenching, sad storyline that ends with all of your friends and you dying (MASS EFFECT 3). Nor are you out to learn about the philosophy of the human mind (BIOSHOCK). You play a DN game to KICK @$$! END OF STORY!\n\nCritics, fans, and people in general want games that are full of ridiculous plot twists, branching storylines, compelling characters, and amazing multiplayer. All of that is well and good, but sometimes you have to throw all of that out the window and just relax and have fun (AND NOT PLAY AS SOME BORING FACELESS CHARACTER!).\n\nI really don't know what people wanted from this game, but I personally think that it is the best FPS game I have played all year! Not because of a bunch of next-gen stuff, but because IT IS FUN!\n\nI have only one minor complaint, Duke is as near-sighted as I am without glasses!\n\nDon't listen to the critics and fans with unrealistic expectations, buy a copy and kick some @$$!\n\n10/10 STARS(I HAVE EVEN PURCHASED THE DLC!, THAT'S HOW GOOD THIS GAME IS!)\n\n(NOW GO KICK SOME @$$!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarCraftZergling/recommended/57900/","StarCraftZergling","StarCraftZerg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarCraftZergling/","102 products in account","After rewriting this review for the 1000th and last time, I finally give to you: Duke Nukem Forever!\n(With a dash of humor)\n\nHoly Mother Teresa ♥♥♥♥ing a rhino for goat milk, what the hell happened in that 12 year development time!?! (This is the campaign I'm talking about) Who the hell said it would be a good idea for dumb ♥♥♥ turret sections and monster truck rally to be in Duke Forever??\n\nHonestly, I want to defend this game because I'm a die hard fan of Duke Nukem, but I just can't give DNF the love it deserves. (Do make note of my time played on this game) Duke Forever's campaign simply goes like this: Duke get's ♥♥♥♥ sucked, aliens come down for coffee/scones, Duke ready to kill, Duke has no jetpack/must use elevator, aliens go pew pew pew, Duke go pew pew pew, Duke smacks ♥♥♥♥ on wall, Duke smacks ♥♥♥♥ on girl, Duke shoot turret, Duke drive truck, Duke punch big alien in ♥♥♥♥, Duke bungie jump off Hoover Dam, Duke do moar pew pew pew, Cycloid gets deaded. Duke (SPOILER) deaded by Nuke #Irony....... What the ♥♥♥♥....\n\nDuke Nukem Forever was a great concept back in the late 90s/early 2000s, sticking to the Duke 3D routes and keeping it as close to the original while adding new elements of gameplay into the mix that, by the trailers, seems to work out well for it. You got to keep all of your weapons, there was a health and armor system, levels weren't linear, and there was a ♥♥♥♥ING MOTORCYCLE!!! I don't mind a monster truck, but a motorcycle? That's the badass's main ride right there! You don't see a Hell's Angel member in a Honda Civic, just like Duke should be on a Harley rather than a truck. But anyway, Duke Nukem Forever 1998-2004 seemed to stick to it's original roots and not add all of that unneeded Halo garbage that it has now! The Duke Nukem Forever of 2011 was such a Halo and Call of Duty knock off, you could of slapped "Call of Nukem: Halo Battlefield" on there and the gameplay would still match the title! What the hell happened to Duke being able to carry 10+ weapons at a time and having to constantly save the game because you don't want to die and restart the episode, or how about how there was a health system?? Oh wait, don't let me forget to mention one of the worst parts of this game: Turret sections.\n\nIf there is a reviewer out there that hit the nail on the head, it was Angry Joe when he stated that "The game had BEAUTIFUL turret sections... EXCEPT I CHECKED THE ♥♥♥♥ING BOX ART AND IT SAYS I'M SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING DUKE ♥♥♥♥ING NUKEM!!!"\n-Duke Nukem Forever Review by Angry Joe.\n\nI couldn't have said it better myself, the game does NOT deserve to have turret sections, monster trucks, PLATFORMING, recharging health, 2-4 weapon limit, linear level design, bland outdated textures, buggy AI, and boring missions. I guess I could say that some of Duke's jokes made me chuckle a bit, but it seems like the game is trying to be more serious than funny...\n\n"So, this is how the anticipation ends. First show of the long awaited comeback tour and the singer has hanged himself on the microphone chord, trying to sing anyway, forcing out a smile and choking out lyrics between grotesque spasms and you're wondering whether it's kinder to cut him down or swing on his legs to help him on his way."\n-DUKE NUKEM FOREVER: FOR REAL THIS TIME by Escapist\n\nI feel like the reviewers do a much better job at explaining this than I do, so you might as well check out Angry Joe's video and Escapist's video because they more accurately describe DNF. I'm tired of writing really goofy ♥♥♥♥ about this game. There isn't much to write because the biggest joke is the game itself. Just go and watch those reviews and tell me if they are true or not.","January 21, 2012","false","724.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/57900/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","First if you want to see something hilarious, go online and look up PC Gamers review of this game. It is pretty funny. They gave it a 80/100 which is a huge joke. If anything, because of that mistake, their editorial license should be permanently revoked.\n\nBuy this for $5 or less in a sale or not at all. I'm giving it a thumbs up only because the combat is satisfying enough to be enjoyed for one playthrough. As far as the game sucking goes, people are not wrong. It has good sound, the enemies are cool, and the weapons are all decent. One of the biggest problems in the game is level design is lazy and just sucks. It is not a great game because it just feels like generic crap compared to other much better fps games. The graphics are not good at all and there are sections where your fps will drop randomly from 60 to 50 for no reason at all other than bad coding. But it doesn't happen often so the game runs smoothly for the most part. It is a run of the mill decent time if you get it for $5 or less like I did because that is about all this game is worth.\n\nWithout yet going into what everyone already knows, I can say that the gameplay could have been done much better, more specifically the level design and interaction in the game. The level design is amatuer at best and feels forced, like they were on a time constraint (which they were). The levels are bland and boring at best. Interacting with something usually consists of pressing E to start opening a door then tapping spacebar repeatedly a few times to pry it open. This mechanic has always been pointless in games and does not need to exist anymore because slamming a key on a keyboard is not considered actual gameplay, so stop using it. Pressing E once is all it should take. Other kinds of interaction include being able to pee in toilets, look in the mirrors to trigger one-liners from Duke, and some other things, all feel pretty pointless and extremely juvenile. Not that the original Duke 3d was sophisticated or anything, it just seems like they took extra pains with this game to make it embarassingly juvenile and goofy. You can also be shrunken down and have to navigate a section of a level while tiny, figuring out what to do, or even drive a RC car at one point while shrunken early on, and none of the gameplay while being shrunken is very well done or very fun at all. One thing that helped ruin the game was its self-awareness. It starts up with Duke playing his own video game then the camera pans back to show two hookers raising up as if they had been sucking him off and they say that the game looked like fun or whatever and Duke quips "after 12 ♥♥♥♥ing years it better be". Oh the irony. If Duke could have seen this game he would have kept his face shut. The game constantly refers to the original Duke Nukem 3d and all that does is make us wish we were playing it instead of this mediocre game. Duke also says quotes throughout the game taken directly from several cool movies, but it is not funny and is just awkward. The timing is really bad and it just feels juvenile and does not fit the situation. I could just see the writers for this game sitting and snickering like two 7th graders in class talking about boobs and weiners and laughing. Unlike Duke Nukem 3D, nothing he ever says in this game is funny or feels like it even should have been said at all.\n\nThe main reason this game failed is that if it were another title rather than using the Duke Nukem name, it would be a solid lesser known game, probably even a cult hit like the game Bulletstorm was. Well, probably not. Like I said this game is just average at best. But the fact that they slapped the Duke Nukem name on a only average game was a slap in the face because the original Duke 3d was so awesome. Doom was the reason I got into PC gaming back around 1996 and then I discovered Duke Nukem 3d and was instantly blown away and it left a lasting impression on me that I will never forget. Then they released this ♥♥♥♥ and I was mortified.\n\nIt is certainly not worth the $20 price tag it normally has but if you can catch it on sale for $5 like I did and just forget about it being anywhere near as good as Duke Nukem 3d, then you can have a somewhat enjoyable playthrough. Comparing it to Duke Nukem 3d which is easily a 9/10, it would only be a 5/10. Or a low borderline 6. If it were named something else and did not have anything to do with Duke Nukem, it would maybe be a 7/10. But comparing it to some other games that I have played recently, it is a 10/10. I'm talking about God awful games like Dark Sector, Velvet Assassin, and Alpha Prime, just to name a few horrifically bad games. Compared to those dog turds, yea buy this lol.","March 1, 2015","true","9.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

Thanks goodness the game wasn't very long so I could actually bare finishing it.\n\nThe multiplayer is very fast paced and rocket based, just like the old duke multiplayers, though I don't know how popular the multiplayer is outside of a few close friends.\n\nIf you really love duke to the point his one-liners can carry you through a game, pick it up, if not...well...don't!","December 6, 2013","false","7.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

(And also for those who just want to know what DNF is really like)\n\nFirst off: Duke Nukem Forever HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT for 12 years, but that does not mean Gearbox has been developing it for 12 years. Got that? Good, let's go.\n\n1. For the Graphics Players:\nThe game is not Crysis. It's not Far Cry 2. It's not even CoD. So, if this is what you base a game on, then don't even bother. DNF is more Serious Sam HD meets HL2 in my opinion. Some textures look awesome, some look really old. Overall, IMO, it's acceptable. I like eye-candy, make no mistake, but this is not what DNF is about. It never was, nor will it ever be.\n\n2. The Profanity, Toilet Humour:\nDuke is a dirty SOB. It's been like that ever since he first got voice. It will always be like that. It's part of the Duke Nukem "thing". It's even rated for it. Expect cursing, expect spending 20 minutes throwing poop around and jarateing on ♥♥♥♥. It's how it is. Get over it.\n\n3. Gameplay:\nThis is where I have a serious issue with the game. So, I have broken it up into parts:\n\n3.1 Linear Gameplay\nThis is my first problem with the game. WTF Gearbox? All DN3D maps were never linear. Sometimes you had to backtrack your way. There were also several ways to get to an objective. From what I have seen so far, there is only one way to get to your current objective and this totally ruins it for me. TotalBiscuit has a video which you can watch of the first 45 minutes of the game, be careful, it might contain spoilers.\n\n3.2 Scripted Events\nAlthough all games have scipted events, there're few things that jarate me off more than a developer who forces you to watch or listen to them. Gearbox will actually block your path so you HAVE to wait for the scripted event to finish. Because it's a linear game, there's obviously no way to skip the event.\n\n3.3 Only 2 Weapons\nDN3D and all older FPS games allowed the player to carry all the weapons with the player. At the start of the game, the load screen says: "Duke Nukem can bench-press 600 pounds". Yet, he is unable to carry more than two weapons...\n\n4. Mouse Smoothing\nYou can scale it down, but you cannot disable it completely. I assume that once we actually delve into the config files, we should be able to. Although, this should be doable in the optons menu.\n\n5. Regenerating Health\nThanks JoeB for reminding me about this. Regenerating health isn't really such a big deal to me, although, it's way off the bat when it comes to Duke Nukem. We're used to health packs to bring our health back up. The game did amuse me with it's own "health packs" though. To regain health, you need to boost your ego. There are several ways to do it in the game. My favourite is admiring yourself in the mirror. This really gave me a laugh. I really think that's one of the game's true Duke Nukem elements. Duke is a narcissist and you get to be one in game.\n\n6. Saving the Game\nKudos lagrenouille for bringing this to my attention. You also can't quicksave in the game. Or save for that matter. The game is based on checkpoints. Yes, isn't that meant for consoles?\n\n7. FOV (Field of View)\nSomething has been bugging me and I couldn't put my finger on it until just now. The FOV is really annoying. I believe it to be around 70-75. I think 90-100 would make this better. Probably easy to change in the config files, although I haven't checked yet and just couldn't be bothered to be honest.\n\nFor now, this is what I have experienced. Not to happy about it and I hope Gearbox actually listens to the community and undo the f-up that they have caused in the game.\n\nOverall, I think this game is not too bad. It's by no means the next Half-Life, but it's playable and I think the modding community is what's going to give this game a longer life.","December 6, 2013","false","4.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Two weapon inventory and regenerating health destroyed a massive portion of the experience, which took away the "Duke" feel and the graphics, tech and animations felt very dated in a kind of Postal 2 sort of way, if Postal 2 were linear.  Past all that, however, the levels and events in the game were very nicely varied and interesting, and the game had plenty of pacing, splitting up the combat with physics puzzles and hazardous terrain that kept combat fatigue away perfectly.  The combat itself was responsive and satisfying enough, despite the lousy gore effects, plus the enemies really packed a mean punch if you don't count the easy bosses.  Finally, with a weak story and a forgettable soundtrack, the game winds down to being a weak and pretty tame 7 hour experience.  It's not a BAD game like Metro 2033 and it's more fun than Halo and "Medal of Duty" ever will be, but even those games had things that this one was lacking.  It kept me playing, though.","June 14, 2011","false","10.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","9"

Where to begin, where to begin... ok, how about the beginning of the game.\n\nYou start the game (after a stupidly easy "boss" fight) by having your ♥♥♥♥ sucked by two clones of the Olsen twins with zero facial muscles and incredibly annoying voices. You then attempt to play pool with balls that defy all known laws of movement. A quick strut down an ego-hall leads you past a bunch of women (who still have no facial muscles) grabbing their boobs at the sight of you, down to a TV host (who still has no facial muscles) who tells you your interview has been cancelled due to aliens lining up to get a hamburger. No, seriously, the first thing this intergalactic menace does is go pick up some burgers.¹\n\nAfter this, you get about 20 hours worth of incredibly linear shooting galleries with brain dead AI, poorly executed sex jokes, and one of the dumbest ideas in video game history, which I will describe after the line break for emphasis.\n\nOK, that was the line break. Now, one of the major selling points of this game was the variety of weapons. All the trailers up to the ones just before release advertised the huge variety of weapons. Well, Mr. Pitchford, if you're so proud of the game's wide weapon variety, WHY THE FLYING ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU IMPOSE A TWO/FOUR WEAPON LIMIT?\n\nOK, that's the single player out of the way. The multiplayer nearly - NEARLY, you understand - made the game recommendable. Good maps (mostly), fun mutators, a wide range of customization options, low lag (mostly), quite fun. Now I know what you're thinking: "But you seemed to like it, why would you not recommend the multiplayer"? Well, it's quite simple. I liked the multiplayer because it reminded me a lot of Unreal Tournament, one of the greatest multiplayer games ever. It then struck me that it would be a much better idea to just go buy one of the Unreal Tournament games instead of buying this for its multiplayer component. Plus, unlike this, the Unreal Tournament games still have a strong playerbase.\n\nI've heard that the 'Doctor Who Cloned Me' DLC was decent, better maps, actual funny jokes, facial muscles, but... I dunno.\n\nTL; DR version: Meh at best single player, good multiplayer, but you'd be better off buying Unreal Tournament for multiplayer purposes.\n\n(Oh, in case you're wondering, no, there is not a single facial muscle in the entire game.)\n\n¹ - OK, I admit, that bit was funny.","July 2, 2014","false","49.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/recommended/57900/","PrimalHunter_779","PrimalHunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/","383 products in account","Duke Nukem: Forever is the sequel to Duke Nukem 3D, a classic game from the 1990's that inspired hundreds of games, mostly due to it's entertaining gameplay, well designed levels, and humour. Duke Nukem: Forever had big shoes to fill, and while it doesn't live up to the hype surrounding its release, it's definitely an enjoyable game despite the flaws.\nThis game has you once again playing as the Duke, living life as a celebrity after crushing the alien invasion in the previous game. The intro of the game has you reliving an awesome fight from the previous game before navigating your house and heading to an interview. While you'll notice the dodgy animations and skewed voicework, you'll also notice the astonishing amount of interactivity and abundance of items in the environment. Numerous posters and various memorabilia concerning Duke Nukem is scattered around the levels, and displays an enormous amount of fan service. You can interact with a large number of items in the environment, including pool tables, telephones, DVD players, toilets, vibrators (?), food, arcade games, weights, basketball, frisbees and even an actual turd (?). This lends itself to the novelty and humour of the game and was definitely one of the standards.\nWhile the actual combat in the game isn't awful, it does feel clunky and dated by today's standards. Many of the weapons lack punch, and end up feeling as if you're firing a glorified water gun. The only satisfying gun in the game is the shotgun, which is relatively to find and locate ammunition for. The rest of the guns are clumsy and spongy to use on enemies.\nUnfortunately, the level design is also quite linear. There's little exploration to be had, and it's relatively easy to find objects like ammo pickups. The constrictive and repetitive level design gets repetitive pretty quickly, and the blandly grey environments don't help this very much.\nThe boss fights in this game are surprisingly solid, and reminded me of old school games like Doom 3. These fights are entertaining and bombastic, but frustrating in that you can only damage them with a single weapon type. This limits the players style and actively forces you to play the game in a specific way. The game's real problem is the lack of creativity and restrictive mechanics, which contradicts the content found in Duke Nukem 3d.\nThe best way to experience Duke Nukem: Forever is the same as a popcorn action movie; turn your brain off, play it once, and don't look too carefully into it. The fun moments in this game make up for the bad ones, and the nostalgic value of this game probably elevated my score slightly. 7 / 10","August 1, 2014","true","29.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Then again, I was around when Duke 3D came out and it was the fratboys who loved it. In the end, the poor reception of Forever is less that the game is genuinely poor (though it is quite uninspired) but that it hasn't grown up. The fratboys who loved it have either gotten jobs and kids and moved on, or they have matured. The audience which loved the crassness of the Duke 3D, the offensiveness of Postal, the schlock of Blood and the gleeful carnage of Carmageddon isn't really there anymore. And those other compatriates of Duke 3D have similarly not survived. Seen in that light, Forever is a way behind the times, and I wish I could say at least the game is solid. It isn't. It's vague, unreliable and frequently comes to a halt because of unclear objectives. Yet when this dinosaur works, it can be somewhat of a spectacle, but one which needs to be kept away from human populations. There are some moments in which the potential of Forever shines through -- perhaps these were Gearbox's efforts to elevate the material -- but you can't spitshine, if not a turd, a rusty old relic indicative of its day but better suited in a museum.","January 27, 2014","false","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Because there were no other shooters. So playing the first ever 3d shooter while constantly sprinting and blasting at warhogs while carrying tons of weapons as well as having an occasional laugh at what the Duke or his enemies were doing was a blast.\n\nBut on the other hand, how do you make an FPS interesting wherein you simply mow down rows of enemies? I don't know, Serious Sam did it and that game had co-op. Bulletstorm did it. To tell you the truth, when I was watching the gameplay trailers I was trying not to think: "what? that's IT?" because for some reason I was believing that there was something more to the gameplay and the game itself that was being kept secret, some spice. That was denial at its best. The game turned out to be a mix of Quake 1, Serious Sam (minuses various and funny enemies), some random kindergarten puzzles thrown in the mix and.....that's pretty much it. And sorry devs, Duke's supposedly hilarious quotes and outburst just don't cut it. Sure, there are some non-cliche moments in the game but they usually last a couple of seconds.\n\nHowever, at least you can only carry a couple of guns at the time, which is supposed to add more realism - if only that was not overshadowed by so many other things. For instance the AI is either charging at you or simply standing still and shooting you from afar (think Killzone 2,3 and how smart your enemies were, the smartest AI in all gaming in fact). The driving stages are okaish, except you are always confined to carefully crafted small areas that are either canyons or areas blocked off by garbage and other nonsense. The Big boss battles are the same: keep on moving, shooting, collect ammo drops, keep running in circles and the enemy won't hit you. No tactics required.\n\nThe aliens of course are kidnapping the white blonde hot-bodied chicks only. No other ethnicity apparently exists on Earth at the time. The whole sexism and overt insecure alpha male heterosexuality shows with almost each one of Duke's outbursts, but I guess there just has to be one game that has its own niche to fill. So I can't comment to negatively on this, I'm just glad that it's only one game that does this sort of thing.\nSome things I can't complain about however. You actually CAN see your legs and you DO cast a shadow and you DO have a voice, and what a voice that is! if only all shooters had those extra three things I usually ask for. But in this case, this rare treat is absolutely wasted on this horribly pretentious game.\nI bet that new Serious Sam (which only took a few years to develop, I reckon) is going to have a similar run'n'shoot hordes of enemies premise, however I think it's going to be pulled off better than this Puke.\n\nUltimately, most of us have grown and matured since 1998, some of us didn't. Some jokes aren't as funny anymore. If this game were released the mere years after the last game, then the similar age-minded audience would clap in awe. I understand the whole old-school nostalgia thing which CAN be delivered with so many recent 2-D platform remakes of the old NES classics. However this game is not a re-make nor does it feel like Duke Nukem part 4 or 5 or whatever. I'm not sure if this is a re-boot either because I doubt any more Duke will be made.\n\nRest in Peace, Duke. It wasn't the aliens, it was the fanbase killed the Duke.","November 27, 2013","false","0.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

There's pieces of Alien and Matrix, plus Schwarzenegger movies. The one-liners are delivered to perfection--creative, witty, and absolutely vulgar in every way.\n\nThis game must have annoyed the hell out of the early reviewers because a 30 metascore out of the gate is just unwarranted.

This meant I was able to go in without any bias and bad impressions the press have been doling out to the game. Now, I'll get the obvious out of the way, this doesn't look like a 2011 game, it looks more like a game from when 3DRealms went under in 2009. This is not to say it looks bad since there are few games that have pushed the envolope for graphics in years. The gameplay is like a mix between Half life 2's scripted linear cinematic presentation and level design and Duke 3D's gun combat and action. Sexist humour permiates this game in the same way it did in Duke3D but the nudity has been pushed even further. If you didn't like this type of humour the last time they did it you'll probably be offended by this. Otherwise you'll find yourself loving Dukes new quips and the bizarness of Duke Vegas.

It definitely doesn't play like Duke Nukem 3D and has some weird things thrown in like regenerating health and a weapon carrying limit. There are also some serious problems with the way Duke's character is written in the base game, especially regarding issues like misogyny, notably The Hive level. Moments like these understandably upset a number of people, but I blame it more on poorly executed writing and design during that section than any malice on the part of the developers. However, I urge all of you to give the DLC "The Doctor Who Cloned Me" a thorough playthrough. Not only is it more fun than the base game, it also contains a moment where the writers completely redeem Duke's character in regard to the aforementioned issues, something that greatly and pleasantly surprised me. Recommended to fans of Duke, just don't expect Duke Nukem 3D all over again.","August 15, 2014","true","38.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/recommended/57900/","AroNocebo","- Aro -","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AroNocebo/","415 products in account","Duke Nukem Forever, probably one of the most anticipated and hyped up games of all time, but did it live up to the expectations of Duke Nukem fans? Not exactly. Does that mean Duke Nukem Forever is a bad game? No.\n\nUnfortunately, Duke Nukem Forever was not very well received by critics and fans when it was eventually released in 2011 after 12 years of on and off development. The most popular places to read PC Gaming reviews all shunned Duke Nukem Forever shortly after it's official release and it was deemed as the worst game in the series. Despite all of the negativity and bad reviews surrounding the game, I decided that I would try it myself to see whether or not it is as bad as everybody makes it out to be... After playing it through a good number of times, I do not think this is a bad game at all, in fact, I truly believe that this is a game worthy of the Duke Nukem title, even though I seem to be very alone with that opinion. I believe that this is a really great game, flawed mainly by it's release date, if it was released back in 2004, it would have been considered a much better game as it doesn't really meet todays standards.\n\nSure, it's not the most phenomenal game ever released, nor is it revolutionary like Duke Nukem 3D or DOOM were, but it's not a bad game either. When it is looked to as the "successor" to Duke Nukem 3D, the game will naturally be compared to it's originals, but if you look past that, Duke Nukem Forever is a good game within it's own right.\n\nIt's lengthy, fast-paced and very interactive single-player campaign is an example of what modern games should be looking to set as their goals, it's very, very rare you will find any singleplayer games with any more than 8 hours of singleplayer game-play in this day and age, so that is a big bonus. The game is also very atmospheric, comedic and  varied, you can tell this game has come from an era from the past, though unfortunately many years too late.\nAll of your favourite weapons from Duke Nukem 3D make a return, so there is no problem there, excluding the fact that you are limited to how many you can carry now (more about that below), there are a few more new weapons to play with such as the Railgun and the Enforcer Cannon which are both satisfying to use, there are a few more but nothing glorious.\nGraphically, the game isn't exactly groundbreaking but it's still a very pretty and well-made game, you can tell that a lot of work has gone into it. The humour is the same as it's always been, cheesy and crude, but funny (most of the time). There are also endless references and easter eggs that you will come across throughout the campaign that are bound to amuse you.\n\nThe game has it's flaws, as most of you will already be aware because the critics love letting you know about it, but there are only two things that spoil this game for me. The first issue is that some of the maps feel linear and relatively simple, especially when compared to Duke Nukem 3D... General exploration is limited and there are little to no secrets to discover in the game, which is a shame given how much fun it was to explore in Duke Nukem 3D, but health bonuses are non-existent anyway now so finding a secret area may not be as great as it once was.\nSecondly, the two weapon limit is frustrating and can ruin the experience more often than not, there is an option to enable a four weapon limit as opposed to the two, but this is still an issue, the reason being is that some weapons are mandatory to destroying certain enemies, with a limited inventory, you are constantly made to pick and chose between the weapons you want on the spot rather than keeping everything at once like you could before. This ultimately damages the singleplayer quite a lot, it also makes exploration and any secrets feel a bit pointless as ammunition and hidden weapons are now more of a burdening choice than they are a bonus.\n\nSo, flaws aside, I will stand by and defend Duke Nukem Forever by saying that it is a good game. Rather than avoiding it based on what most critics had to say, you should ultimately decide for yourself if you like it or not after playing it through, I know lots and lots of people are on a bandwagon preaching hate to the game when they haven't even given it a chance, and that's just lame. Rather than paying full price, I do recommend buying the complete set (DNF & DLC) during a sale. Don't believe everything you hear, try things for yourself before you make assumptions.\n\nThe short version: This game is not as bad as people make it out to be.","February 13, 2015","true","48.3"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Infact i really enjoy DNF even though i havent finished it all quite yet. I never played the original duke nukem's so i have nothing to compare them to, but i have loved this version. The reviews complaimed about graphics, linear gameplay, and innapropriateness, but thoser factors are not what i look for in this kind of game. I bought this game to have fun, not for a serious hardcore experience. So wether if the gameplay is liear, of if the graphics are a bit dated, it doesnt effect the fun experience. As for graphics, i cant say anything abotu the consoles, but personally for 13 years of development, with multiple restarts on the graphics, they look pretty damn good maxed out. As for the innapropriateness, i thought that was the point of this game? People said duke took it to far thsi time buti guess thats just personal oppinon.\n\nAll in all i am glad i bought DNF, and have had a blast with it, with more to come.","July 3, 2011","true","12.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The graphics are pretty good in my opinion, considering the ancient engine its running on, I would have preferred to see it on something better in terms of game engine, but I'm content with what it is. I paid full price for this game, and I have no regrets, it is exactly what it promised to be, a Duke Nukem Game.

Understand what kind of game this is, and you'll enjoy it.\n\nAllow me to elaborate: This game is not the pinnacle of game design, or full of fresh ideas, or show-stopping in any way. What it is is a fun shooter with plenty of throwbacks and references to the 90's/early 2000's. It's not without its flaws, but it is plenty of fun and worthy of a collection, especially for a tenner.\n\nGraphics- No, they aren't great. No, they don't push the limits of anything beyond a low-midrange computer. But they get the job done and do look good while doing so. Pigcops, certain cars, certain weapons, octabrains, and bosses are modeled very well, and you can definitely tell what they are and what they were modeled after (meaning you'll recognize a battlelord right away if you've played Duke3D). Plus, since this game doesn't push high-end setups, it's accessible to everyone.\n\nSound- Not much to speak of here. The sound is done well. Guns have enough punch. Music is done well. Stereo separation and directional audio does what it needs to.\n\nGameplay- Honestly, this is where it matters most. You do buy a game for gameplay, not to just look at graphics. Again, don't expect this to rule the gaming world with fresh, innovative play. But, if you're looking for a shooter that's fast, precise, and doesn't do much of the cover mechanic, this is it. Plenty of stuff to shoot, plenty of guns to use, plenty of bosses to fight and die against.\n\nOverall, good for several playthroughs and some multiplayer. This is a basic 2011 shooter with 1998 roots, and they show. I happen to like gameplay like this. If you also do, buy and enjoy. If not, go ahead and move on.","February 20, 2013","true","34.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This meant I was able to go in without any bias and bad impressions the press have been doling out to the game. Now, I'll get the obvious out of the way, this doesn't look like a 2011 game, it looks more like a game from when 3DRealms went under in 2009. This is not to say it looks bad since there are few games that have pushed the envolope for graphics in years. The gameplay is like a mix between Half life 2's scripted linear cinematic presentation and level design and Duke 3D's gun combat and action. Sexist humour permiates this game in the same way it did in Duke3D but the nudity has been pushed even further. If you didn't like this type of humour the last time they did it you'll probably be offended by this. Otherwise you'll find yourself loving Dukes new quips and the bizarness of Duke Vegas. Give this game a chance if you're a Duke fan, Hail To The King. 8/10","June 19, 2011","true","109.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A new Duke Nukem game. I laughed, killed things, slapped boobs, took a photocopy of my ♥♥♥ during massive firefights to keep myself healed. Great game. It isn't Half Life 3, stop excpeting Half Life 3. It is duke for ♥♥♥♥ sakes.\nOnly complaint is the lack of oldschool weapon system, you only get two at a time, but it definitely added challenge for ammo scrapping and having to use weapons you don't like on occasion. I ♥♥♥♥ed myself over a few times, didn't expect octobrains and had no shotgun and wound up in an area of nothing but octobrains for example. I found myself playing through different areas rather differently than the last just because of the ammo layouts. Keep Duke's gold pistol for the whole game it really is your best side arm.\n\nMULTIPLAYER IS AWESOME.\nSingle player 4/5\nMultiplayer 5/5. It is amazing. This is how the ♥♥♥♥ you 1v1 or have lan/party games. So much fun, and when you are in free for all it allows you to decorate your Dukes a bit and doesn't stop you from mirroring another player.

I actually found this game to be very entertaining, and here are the reasons why.\n\nFirst of all, it's Duke! That should be enough for you right there. But in all seriousness this game is not as bad as people claim. It all depends on what you are willing to accept to play as your favorite over the top macho man again. It is an oldskool shooter that will remind us that was gaming in the 90's of a simpler time. When you dident need a gripping story about how everything was terrible and serious, you just wanted to have some fun!\n\nAnd fun it is, from the very start where you can walk around your palace like appartment and interact with the environment to the over the top action scenes with monsters big as houses eating your RPG one rocket at a time. The nudiebar is one of my favorite places since it gives you a break from the normal gameplay and lets you interact with stuff in the world. Beeing able to flush a toilet or use a pool table is such a throwback to the good old games before Call of Battle: Russia must die!\n\nBut ofcourse there are faults with the game. You can notice that there have been lots and lots of different people working on this over a long period of time. The vechicle parts of the game are terrible and the turret sections makes me want to point the gun at myself instead. But it's not worse than say the CoD single player campaigns or the Battlefield ones.\n\nIf you can relax and just take this game for what it is you will have a good time with it. But if you have problem with slapstick humor, full frontal nudity and double-entendres, this is not (and has never been) a game for you.","December 3, 2013","true","13.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Pointing out the good and bad of the game.\n\nAhh, we've been waiting forever for Duke Nukem Forever. An game that's been In developement hell for 12 years. And the squeal to Duke Nukem 3D, and DNF basically Ignored the past Duke spin-offs like Zero Hour, Land of the Babes, and Time to Kill. Since THIS IS, a squeal to Duke3D.\n\nNow, this game Is known for being an pretty bad game, reviewers mostly point out the flaws Instead of the good. There Is some good, there Is some bad. The Good, Is Duke himself, he hasn't changed much, not one bit. The Babes are back (they do look souless xD), the weapons from Duke3D return once again, and the combat Is pretty good. The Bad, Is the wall boobs (yes, there Is wall boobs, you can slap them), the jokes aren't as clever anymore, they're more Immature once and a while. The regenerating health, and two weapon thing (there Is an option to expand the Inventory). They tried mixing classic FPS and modern FPS, the two. Really don't go together, but DNF kind of done It right. The game was pretty fun, It's kind of addicting also. Specially the Muiltplayer. But, there IS some hackers In the Muiltplayer. Which kind of makes It, not so fun at times. So, I'd suggest getting out of a game If you spot an hacker.\n\nWell, the story feels more like a rehash or retelling of Duke3D, Ailens have returned to Earth once again to capture the women, and Duke yet again has to save the world. Simple story for simple fun! The levels are an bit linear at this time, but they're fine.\n\nThe game also has an DLC which gives you another campiang called The Doctor Who Cloned Me. (I haven't tried this out yet).\nAnd some Muiltplayer DLC which adds more maps.\n\nWould I recommend DNF? Well, sure It has some flaws and It's hated on deeply. But Hey, It's better than Postal 3, which Is an game RWS doesn't want you to even buy! DNF has some good In there, and It's totally recommended.

It definitely doesn't play like Duke Nukem 3D and has some weird things thrown in like regenerating health and a weapon carrying limit. There are also some serious problems with the way Duke's character is written in the base game, especially regarding issues like misogyny, notably The Hive level. Moments like these understandably upset a number of people, but I blame it more on poorly executed writing and design during that section than any malice on the part of the developers. However, I urge all of you to give the DLC "The Doctor Who Cloned Me" a thorough playthrough. Not only is it more fun than the base game, it also contains a moment where the writers completely redeem Duke's character in regard to the aforementioned issues, something that greatly and pleasantly surprised me. Recommended to fans of Duke, just don't expect Duke Nukem 3D all over again.","August 15, 2014","true","38.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

IT'S DUKE. Period end of story. Problem is, most people are looking for a "new" style experience with open levels, top notch graphics, PC acting and situations... but that is not Duke. Never was. This feels like when I first sat down with Duke Nukem 3D so many years ago. Everything is campy, over the top, straight linar gameplay with well defined goals. The graphics are poor by todays standards, but I honestly do not believe that Gearbox tweaked the engine very much after prying it from 3DRealms hands. (the game did go through more than 3 engine changes since it was first announced way back in 1997! ) Though they are functional and work for the Duke universe. Do not expect a deep game from DNF, the series was never deep and this is no different.\n\nDNF is a relic, but some of us older gamers would like to see our relic; in all his mysogynistic, foul mouthed, gun toting, narcissistic, alien killing glory.","February 26, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sfelink/recommended/57900/","sfelink","findioth8r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sfelink/","144 products in account","I really really tried to give this game a chance despite so many negative reviews. I loved the originals, even replayed them on win7 with some 3rd party tools. Despite how much I liked the originals, this game is terrible. It's so bad that I will not buy another game by Gearbox.\n\nI played the original games when DN first came out.  Duke Nukem Forever is a crappy imitation, with slightly better graphics. I say slightly better graphics because most of the game is too dark, and using Duke Vision of course, takes out the color. I'd bet they made it too dark so we WOULD use duke vision, thereby removing the need to colorize. It's not funny enough, more importantly it JUST ISNT FUN.  Too many stupid stupid puzzles wasting time, and NOT ENOUGH GIBBING!. Every short level seems to have 3 or 4 stupid stupid puzzles to solve before one can proceed.\n\nThe interaction with in-game items is clunky. Running/jumping is awkward. Even something as simple as auto-stomping shrunken enemies is inconsistent. I hit two pig cops with the shrink ray and ran over, around , and back and forth and the auto-stomp didnt work (it did work on the first two I tried). OH, and there's also way too much time spent shrunk. In one area we have to jump from one box across to another box. Due to the shortcomings of the way the character runs/jumps, I wasted 20 minutes trying to get across. Each time I fell, I would have to climb boxes on one side of the rack, run across to the other side of the rack, climb more boxes, AGAIN run across to the other side of the rack, then try to jump and fall, only to repeat the pointless exercise again. I finally noticed, on the far side of the opposite rack, the back corner had a different texture so we could climb it. Immediately after that room there was yet another stupid puzzle that involved mini-duke running and jumping and trying to not get electrocuted.  Again, they got too cute with all of the STUPID STUPID puzzles.\n\nAlso there are new weapon restrictions. One of my favorite weapons, the rocket launcher, is limited to 5 rounds total. Additional problems: too restricted in game-play. Most of it so far is clear one small area with only one path to proceed, move on to the next small area with a very limited set of options.\nIt's like 3-D arcade play. Or playing a game in a long twisting turning hallway that's painted with different scenes.  And in keeping with the arcade/console gameplay, the ability to manually save a game has been removed. Yes, they've now added checkpoints, so saves happen at random intervals and we can't save before we try to do something jumping across a gap in one of the stupid stupid puzzles.\nOne other asinine "feature". I guess ol' Duke hasn't been keeping in shape. If you run, he starts panting LOUDLY after about 3 seconds. Not so macho, I guess...\nThe whole purpose of a game is to have fun. If you want to play this while getting a root canal to distract you from the pain, AND the game is less than $1, I'd say go for it. If you want to buy the game to play for fun, don't buy it, unless you actually like things like root canals, meaning you're a masochist.\nNOTE: The DLC game was MUCH more enjoyable than the main game. It was actually more like Duke Nukem instead of computerized sudoku.","March 23, 2015","false","22.1"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","15","30","0","0"

Till this day I like me some Duke3D so I was hoping for some good times here.\n\nTurns out the game isn't that bad, it's by no means great, the visuals are dated and there's some silly parts but it's more amusing than the slew of games trying to be as real as possible. Is DNF a dumb game? Heck yes it is, it's dumb as hell and that's why it's good- it's not trying to be story driven, it knows what it is and rolls with it like a good b-movie.\n\nSince it came out it's clearly been updated, 4 weapon limit instead of 2 (that's a nice fix there) and I've not had many crashes so far. The guns have a nice feel to them, the alien weapons less so but the guns really feel powerful, and if that's not your thing you can always hurl weights into the faces of aliens which looks even more hard hitting.\n\nThe visuals are dated but that's how Duke 3D was, Quake was out shortly around Duke 3D and that didn't stop it from being fun eh? The game looks fine, I don't get the hate for this stuff especially with the slew of retro games that GoG puts out that get so much love. Yes this game came out looking like a slightly nicer Doom3 years later but screw it that's not what makes a game.\n\nFor 60 the game would have been a major let down, but for 3? I'm MORE than happy and I'ds say even up to 15 it's not a bad time. I'm not saying this game is great, I'm saying it's good, it's not bad and it's certainly not as crap as the reviewers lead you to believe. See it on sale?

Obviously, I would try to procure this game on sale certainly as it has been out for quite some time.\n\nBased on the low critic score, I had low expectations.

I am also enjoying this game. I believe the metacritic score, along with most of those reviews of which it is comprised, is misleading. Better to read the Steam user reviews in this case. I would certianly score it somewhere in the 70-80 range for a FPS. Obviously, I would try to procure this game on sale certainly as it has been out for quite some time.\n\nBased on the low critic score, I had low expectations. But as I play the game, I am pleasantly surprised and am finding it addicitng. Even though, as I play, I find myself forgetting what my objectives are, the flow of the game is good, the graphics are good-enough, it is broken up into nicely timed auto saves, there always seems to be something new and different with each level, different scenarios allow for the applications of different weapons, and fighting the Bosses is fun.\n\nThis is the first review I wrote, mainly because as I am about 30-40% done and I think it is a good game from a good series that seems to have gotten misleadingly smeared a bit by the metacritic community.\n\nThe DLC Doctor Who Cloned Me is better. I am really enjoying playing it. Dylan is a great sidekick. The visit to the Burning Bush is refreshing.

The latter didn't work too well in DNF due to the power structure of the game's weapon set, though upping the carriable weapons to 4 in the game's option menu resolves any issues. The game featured lots of variety throwing in driving, platforming, turret & minigame sections, which were actually excelently placed, alternating nicely with the standard first person shooting gameplay sections so you never had too much of one thing at a time. Wolfenstein: The New Order notably had a problem with doing just that as the game threw non-combat after non-combat section at you in the middle portion of the game in a maybe 4:1 ratio with the first person shooting & bundled up all of the game's fps at the beginning & ends, so kudos to 3D Realms/Gearbox for getting that right.\n\nForever's FPS component is actually a lot of fun despite the regen health, limited weapon capacity & the slow movement speed. Shooting aliens is still shooting aliens, & DNF does it well.\n\nStory wise, it's whacky & expected. Basically the aliens from 3D come back to earth, attack & abduct all the women, & you, being Duke Nukem have to defeat them & save everyone. The writing frequently makes nostalgic references to not only DN3D but also other games from the time period like Doom & System Shock 2. The one liners are also enjoyable in the game, as always. One particular segment I liked was where Duke, shrunk to the size of an action figure navigates across a pantry shooting shrunk aliens.\n\nThe multiplayer is reminiscent of arena shooters. Despite having a 2 weapon limit in a set clearly not designed for such a thing, it also works quite well, the teamplay mode in particular can feature some cooperation between players using different weapons to their advantages.\n\nOverall, DNF isn't a work of art, no one really expected it to be, & it doesn't live up to 12 years of hype, or the awesome 2001 trailer, or its predecessor Duke Nukem 3D, but if you were to use one word to describe it, it would be fun. DNF is just that, a whole lot of whacky fun to be enjoyed for the right price. I payed $7.50 & don't regret it.\n\n6/10","October 8, 2015","true","19.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I myself was an avid fan of Duke Nukem 3D on the N64, and played it regularly with my brother anf friends for a long period of time. So, being familiar with Duke Nukem myself, I can say that my review will be based a little on my appreciation for Duke Nukem franchise, however I will try to be as unbiased as possible.\n\nDuke Nukem, having previously saved the world from the alien invasion, is now regarded as a celebrity and world superstar amongst the global population. The aliens once again attack the earth and steal the babes (only the hot ones) in search of revenge against their nemesis and planet earth. As a result, Duke Nukem goes back into action to save the world from the aliens once again.\n\nWith a really nice graphical update from its predecessor (this game has been in development for a very long time), as well as Duke's classic inappropriate wit, I definitely enjoyed reliving the Duke Nukem experience. Some may say it goes a little over the top, however Duke's personality as well as those of other character such as Captain Dylan, make this a very comical FPS experience, with plenty of cheesy lines and film references to boot. Although a simple storyline (very typically Duke Nukem style), the FPS experience is still enjoyable, with classic weapons such as the shrink ray, expansion ray, trip mines, holo Duke etc. Ego boosts such as lifting weights, or shooting hoops can increase your ego (which acts as a health bar) as you progress through the campaign. As well as ego boosts, there are also other hidden Easter Eggs to find, making the levels fun to explore. A game worth getting for any Duke Nukem fan in my opinion, especially during the sales, and also worth playing for those new to the franchise.\n\nPros\n+ The full Duke Nukem experience with bucket loads of comical quotes and references\n+ Classic enemies and weapons\n+ Hidded Easter Eggs (Ego boosts + more)\n+ DLC for an extended storyline, which is also great fun for those who love the base game (cheap on sale)\n+ Achievements\n\nCons\n- Fairly standard FPS mechanics\n- Some frustrating and tedious section (such as using a turret against incoming ships)\n- The occasional bug can make AI enemies and companions become stuck\n- When pig cops jump at you they kind of float in mid-air towards you rather that having a fluid jump\n\nMy Score: 7/10","December 9, 2015","true","42.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

But you cannot avoid it, as they are only hurt with the explosive kind, and their ammo is VERY limited\n- they raised the limit of weapons from 2 to 4, like most games nowadays do. I rather be in a less realistic, more fun world, where you can carry all the weapons you can find, like the old games did.\n- it's less of a stage-exploration game, and more of a puzzle game.\n- no co-op game.\n\nReview 2: From the game itself, without comparision\na parody of FPS Games, full of quotes and references. the stages are a bit weird, and quite linear and sometimes short. the game focuses alot on puzzles, and if you ever are in a combat area, the music can guide you as to when it ends and when the puzzle part start.\nThere are very few times that you are in danger while in a puzzle sequence, and most of the time if you do indeed die, you automatically respawn.\n\nAside from that, death means loading screen. A.. VERY.. LONG.. AND.. BORING.. LOADING.. SCREEN.. THAT.. MAKES.. UP.. FOR.. THE.. GAME.. NAME.. AS.. IT.. TAKES..... FOREVER!!!! bwahahahaha, this joke never gets old!!!\n\nPros:\n- graphics are good.\n- dukematches are fun if you have friends to play with, and it gives you props for your delight :b\n- puzzles, alot (if you like them)\n\nCons:\n- linear stages.\n- props gained from dukematches cannot be used in the main game.\n- no co-op, but then again, the game is quite short.\n- your allies (if any) never die, except when they do.\n- boss mandatory weapons, you cannot stick with your favourites, you gotta use what the game wants you to use.\n- puzzles, alot (if you hate them).\n- using freeze weapon underwater kills you.\n- beer, holoduke, steroids drop all the time, but you never really need/use them.\n- the freaking turret stages are annoying.

As Duke says himself near the beginning of the game “after 12 ♥♥♥♥ing years, it better be (good).” Sadly, the game was thoroughly mediocre and nobody was impressed. Strangely, DNF has a 55 metacritic rating which is rare for a big name game but the Steam player reviews for the game are “mostly positive.” I’d guess that’s because no matter how disappointing the game is, it still isn’t “horrible.”\n\nIt’s been so long since I played the old DOS game Duke Nukem 3D (Or Duke Nukem 1 & 2 before that) so I can’t really recap it. Fortunately, you don’t need to have played to older games to get what’s going on in DNF. An alien fleet is looming over the Earth and the US president is confident that peace negotiations are going well. It’s a good chance these are the same aliens from the previous Duke Nukem games so the president is worried that our hero Duke is going to pick a fight and start a war. Naturally, the aliens attack (and start stealing Earth’s hot women) so it’s up to Duke Nukem to kick their asses once again.\n\nGameplay for Duke Nukem Forever is straightforward first person shooter with no real innovations, except a few places in the game where you get shrunk down to the size of a Barbie doll and need to navigate terrain puzzles while avoiding the huge (normal size) aliens. The puzzles in the game are not too difficult to figure out, which is a good thing because DNF doesn’t have a “hint” system (where you hit a button and it shows you where you’re supposed to go next). Usually the door you’re supposed to go through has an orange flash, but it is still possible in a few places not to know what to do next (like one level in particular involving a crane wrecking ball).\n\nWhen I first played through the game about a year ago, one of the gripes I had was the limited weapon inventory. For a first person shooter there’s actually an adequate variety of guns to choose from, both human and alien (pistol, shotgun, machinegun, rocket launcher, etc.) The problem was that you could only carry 2 weapons at a time like in Halo 1.  When you run out of ammo, you can drop the gun you’re holding and pick one up from a fallen enemy. This would have been fine except that one of the game’s Steam achievements requires you to carry the pistol for the entire game, leaving you with 1 other weapon. I believe the developers patched it though, so now you can carry 4 weapons at any given time. The game’s health system is the now standard regenerating life system except that instead of being called health, it’s called ego. You can raise your maximum ego by doing various environmental things like looking a porno magazines or lifting weights that you find lying around on various levels. Most of your ego boosts will probably come from killing bosses though.\n\nPros:\n+Fights with giant alien bosses are always a plus in my book. Unfortunately, only a couple of these fights involve outside the box thinking. For example the giant alien queen requires pipe bombs and dodging alien impregnators. Most boss fights just require spamming rockets and circle strafing. All bosses can only be hurt by turrets and explosive weapons.\n+Decent variety in enemies and environments. The game’s graphics aren’t bad when it comes to the grotesque alien enemies that you’re facing. You get an up close look at a few of the melee enemies. I wasn’t a big fan of the alien hive level because of the weird night vision system that the game uses (Duke Vision) but at least  it changes things up a bit. The underwater level was kind of fun where you need to swim from air supply to air supply.\n\nCons:\n-Outdated humor. The game makers tried to keep the feel of the old Duke Nukem games by having Duke constantly spit out one liners and other macho stuff. The problem is that he seems to say something every time you kill an enemy so some of the quotes keep repeating over and over (“Wonder how many pork chops I can make out of you” after killing a pig alien which is one of the most common enemies in the game). Since you’re killing aliens every few seconds a ton of the quotes are heard about a hundred times by the end of the game. Have you seen the Expendables movies with Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger? You know how all the old washed up action heroes keep using quotes from their successful movies? The DNF humor feels kind of like that.\n-The game just doesn’t stand out in any way. If this wasn’t supposed to be the glorious return of Duke Nukem, the game wouldn’t have been such a disappointment. People would have just said, “meh nothing special about the game. Play it and forget it.” But of course the fans seem to feel like the 12 years since the previous game should have been spent perfecting Duke Nukem Forever.\n\nA friend was using the Steam family sharing thing to play DNF off of my account and I asked why of all the available games he would be playing a game so mediocre. He said it was because he hadn’t tried it but had played the previous Duke Nukem games. I guess it’s like the Aliens vs. Predator movie franchise. Everyone seems to think the movies suck, but I like Aliens and I like Predators, so might as well see the movie once. Make sure that you don’t pay too much for the game though (less than $5). As for the game’s DLC “The Doctor Who Cloned Me,” the DLC is actually pretty long (about 5 hours I think) and doesn’t really add much new to the experience. I think there’re only a couple new weapons, but there are a few new bosses to fight.\n","January 7, 2015","true","22.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So reads the catchphrase to the manliest of men's latest outing. A testosterone fueled rage across the state of Nevada in search of serious payback. An unrelenting rampage of gunfire, one-liners, dismemberments, eviscerations and urinating on your foe's cerebral cortex. Nothing quite like it. Except that I wouldn't bet on it.\n\nThe thing about Duke Nukem is that you're looking for that 90s feel of a game. Where you shoot before asking questions and where cover if for the weak. You go, face first into the fray, killing and disrespecting the invaders of earth as you brutally reduce them to porkchops. Which makes it so weird that Forever holds you back for what seems to be a large portion of the rather short game. The first hour is spent toying with lewd buttons, curling dumbells and drawing ♥♥♥♥♥ on whiteboards. The following shooting section is to brief to qualify for a jump in adrenaline and all the subsequent shootouts are few and far between.\n\nI mean, think about it; You're Duke Nukem, the blueprint of masculinity. Any blogger from Tumblr would cry in irreversible horror at the binary gender appropriation this man radiates. Yet the game makes you look and play like what Arnold "The Governator" Schwarzengger would refer to as "a girly man." You are weak; you can't take a lot of punishment, and when you add up the score you don't really murder that many aliens. It gets worse. As the game progresses, you're sent into more and awkward set piece stages that have no place in a testosterone fueled shooter. It even sends you to fight a boss underwater. Something the game wasn't calculated to handle as the swimming controls are set in stone and you're even weaker than before.\n\nForever does have its moments. Usually in the form of banal comedy or the sudden change up where you're shrunk to seven inches and you have to ride an RC car through a hotel while dodging kitchen appliances. At times you'll have fun with the physics engine while playing a game of pool or you spend a good few minutes listening to Duke's baritone giggles as he slaps a set of mammaries that are attached to wall (true story). However, Forever is lacking in so many areas, and in particular the design and refinement that you'll be glad when it's over.","May 24, 2015","false","9.9"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","49","25","51","7","0"

Not at all a game that deserves a metascore of ~50/100.\n\nThe interaction with the game world is great. You can lift weights, play pinball or pool, sign autographs, drink beer, take a leak, etc. Especially the beginning and the strip club level shine in this regard. This interaction with the world makes the game pretty unique. The action is solid and the fights are pretty challenging (I play on hard mode). The only thing that's not fun is the driving: The game is filled with driving sequences and they get a little annoying over the time.\n\nPros:\n\n- Great interaction with the environment\n\n- Silly Duke Nukem humor\n\n- Solid shootouts\n\n- Simple retro fps: No unfitting skill/experience system (The new Shadow Warrior is doing this unfortunately...)\n\n- Lenghty campaign: Much longer  than your average modern fps\n\n- Cool weapons: Shrinking cannons, freezing cannons, etc. The game keeps the cool weapons from Duke 3d\n\n- Variety of different environments: Casinos, deserts, organic alien environments, etc. The levels don't get boring\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Dated graphics: especially outdoors, but the game has its moments (sometimes it actually looks good).\n\n- Almost no blood! This really bugs me. Enemies often explode into meaty pieces, but leave no blood decals. I would expect much more blood from Duke Nukem.\n\n- Unfitting weapon restrictions / regenerating health: Strange modernizations in an otherwise old-school game. It should use health packs and it should let you carry all your weapons at the same time. While initially you were only allowed to carry two weapons, a patch changed that number to four. Still: This shouldn not be restricted at all.\n\n- Tedious driving sequences\n\n- No mod support: Duke Nukem 3D had a great modding community, and it even has today. Not supporting mods for this one is just stupid.\n\n~75/100 would be a fitting score, I would go as far as giving it 80+.","November 2, 2014","true","21.6"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

It's nothing game breaking, nor is it anything revolutionary, but what it does do fairly well is Duke Nukem. If you are expecting Duke Nukem, you will get Duke Nukem, in all his updated graphical glory.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/recommended/57900/","stragglerastic","Lagg&","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/","292 products in account","Finally finished this a little while ago but only just now decided to write a review because it's hard to talk about this game in a way that doesn't make me seem like a double standard making jackass. Plus the standard negative stuff about DNF has been beaten to death over and over again in a way that would make Duke himself blush. So I'll try not to fall into that trap.\n\nIt's hard to talk about Duke because the games and the man himself is 80% gimmick and 20% one liners. This was no exception. So I can't just say it was too gimmicky. Because no ♥♥♥♥ Sherlock,  it's Duke Nukem. Problem is, there was 98% gimmick, 10% one liners and 0.5% things to kill. That was the big negative to me. There was too much focusing on memes that were sometimes not even duke related. There was too much gimmick happening and not enough shooting stuff. Like the minigames that are almost memes themselves at this point. It was like the game was trying to make up for lost time in the self-referential humor and thus you got huge spans of non-action sequences like the strip club. Make no mistake, Duke has always been about being cheesy and awesome and killing swathes of enemies. But this didn't have much of that all things considered.\n\nNow let me get something straight, I'm a straight man and like any straight man I like women and I like boobs. I've seen and touched many of both in my time. So believe me when I say that there were way, way too many instances of "omg look boobs!" Just way too many, it's what you'd expect either a kid or a sexually frustrated adult to put into a video game. Like I said before lots of boob is perfect for Duke because he's Duke. Which is why the strip clubs in the original games were just fine. It was over the top and just great. But this is over the top to the point where someone fell down and broke their neck.\n\nOther thing that almost made me create a review just to rant was the ♥♥♥♥ing hoover dam underwater ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Holy crap. This level frustrated me almost to the point of just stopping right then and there. I don't like underwater levels in 3D games in the first place but I do acknowledge they can be done right. This wasn't. It brought the pace of the game to a screeching halt even worse than the non-action sequences. I died more times in the leech fight and the area near it than anywhere else in the game including the final boss (which I actually died 0 times on so that should say something). Simply because I couldn't move fast. I know you're  thinking "you just have no skill". Maybe that's true, but this was not a matter of skill. Skill cannot be used when you move like a bug through taffy. It gives you little opportunities to artfully dodge like you could in just about every other game.\n\nThat said, the final fight made up for it and it was suitably epic. Still, not sure I can recommend it. Even though I think the absolute nail biting hate towards it is kind of silly I do understand to an extent. It's not faithful to the material. Even though I love hearing Jon and all that. It just lacked the gameplay. Which was a gigantic part of Duke 3D and such. If you liked those there is no real guarantee you'll like this one. There's just not enough gameplay and too much pandering and meme-whoring and not enough of what made the series great in the first place: Killing things. Killing lots of things and killing lots of things in a smooth and flowing manner.","July 7, 2014","false","15.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","3"

And, just like the old games, each map could fit on an old 3.5" diskette.  I mean, on the one hand you can rest easy knowing you're *never* very far from a checkpoint / level warp... but on the other, the maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ small.  It's like traveling the world... 10 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feet at a time.\n- The game is old (4 years as of this writing), and plays even older.  Same stuff you heard at release - graphics are dated, engine is clunky, mechanics are simplistic.  For a Duke Nukem game, it's just fine.  For a "game we waited 12 years for", its an astounding disappointment.\n- It's short.  It took me 10 hours on "standard difficulty" to just plough through the whole thing, and that was with me wasting time to do stuipd sh!t like "Win an air hockey game 7 - 0 at the strip club".\n- The production values are rough.  The few cutscenes look like PS2 era graphics, or are literally "flash animation" type moving pictures.  After its done you can see that the "Triptych Offices" were an abandoned condo with a kitchenette and two chairs.  The game is an accurate reflection of what those kinds of resources get you.\n\nSo, why is this a positive review?  I enjoyed it.  As I said, I have no vested interest in the Duke Nukem franchise (trust me - I understand why they're upset), and I got the game for practically nothing.  As such, it's easy for me to simply not care about a lot of things.  If you're of a similar mindset, or can snag this during one of STEAM's sales (or both), I think it'd be worth your time / money.  I mean, there's an alien monster-boss with three ♥♥♥♥.

After 15 years of development hell the first true masterpiece in video games is here.\nThe game takes a lot of cues from modernist fiction. Much of the game is about topics such as sadness, loss, addiction, alcoholism, failure, family, mental health, morality, PTSD, fame, chaos, masculinity, spirituality and isolation. The structure of Duke Nukem Forever reinforces this and the entire game is split up into vignettes all structured like a recursive fractalic ionizing radiation symbol.\nThe game is set years after the first alien invasion and chronicles the post-war life of duke much in the same way the Greek dark age poem The Odyssey talks about Odysseus' struggle with post-war life and the hard transition for him. The game picks up shortly after the alien war. Duke has fallen on hard times, after an unsuccessful spout in politics, his failing business ventures leave him facing bankruptcy. The game switches then to 7 years later, duke is no longer remembered as the savior of earth and is forced into private life as a used car salesman married to a woman who doesn't love him and who is cheating on him. Duke falls into a deep depression and visions of his past haunt him at night, slowly the visions creep into the day and this vignette ends with a violent outburst in which duke believes the aliens have come back to earth.\nNow it's 3 years later, duke is an a mental facility dealing with the horrors of his past. His wife has left him and he struggles with a lot of health problems in this chapter. One of the patients in the facility recognizes duke but slowly over the course of the vignette the player realizes that the patient thinks that Duke is the great king Gilgamesh a champion of masculinity from the ancient near eastern epic poem.\nDuke next transition is into the desert, set only a year later duke is living on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Duke is forced into an emasculating job as a male ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who is forced to do disgusting acts for peanuts. Duke is slowly drinking himself to death in an attempt to kill the pain in his life. At several times during the course of this phase in his life he wanders drunk through the desert, in the last of this section Duke is lost in the desert for 40 days before reaching civilization and being tested with addiction by a strip club and gives into his desire. This section mirrors the temptation of Christ but twists the ending.\nThe next section takes place only 3 days later, Duke is an emasculated, mess of a man make impotent by the drink. Duke jumps off the Hoover Dam but fails and lands onto a child.\nDuke wakes up in a prison hospital missing his left leg. Duke has been sentenced to life without parole for drug possession and killing the child at the end of the of previous chapter. In the hospital the doctors discover Duke has prostate cancer from the steroids duke took during his youth. Duke loses all masculinity after his surgery and develops into a fat, sexless man confined to a wheelchair. Duke yet again falls into a deep pit of depression and wants to kill himself but just can't do it. It's implied that Duke is bottom to his cell partner. Duke dreams of the aliens from Duke Nukem 3D returning and him regaining his former glory and fame. Duke wakes up and starts crying, he reflects on his life and all the paths that brought him to his current state. Duke hangs himself in his prison cell.\nThis game is a truly bold move for the franchise and has entered gaming into a brave new world of creativity and story telling.","July 25, 2015","false","13.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Used to play it a lot and run a dedicated server but haven't really spent much time on it in a long time.  It's not the best game on steam but it doesn't suck either.  I really enjoyed playing the single player campaign and the DLC.  Played a lot of Duke Nukem back in the 90's and this game is what brought me back into PC gaming after not gaming for a long time.  I think the graphics are decent.  Not exactly anything realistic and jaw dropping like Crysis 3 but still not bad.\n\nThe multi-player is what I spent the most time on.  It was an absolute blast for about a year after it came out.  You have to run your rear off pretty much non-stop.  It's easy to kill and be killed.  Weapons are pretty powerful and it's common to score a fast kill.  Getting all the achievements in the game takes "FOREVER" and to get them done within your lifetime takes friends helping you get them.  The multi-player is extremely solid except the main problem is lag and at times a ton of it.  So much so people can kill you before your gun can even touch them.  If you host or have really low ping you for sure have a big advantage over players who don't.  Try hosting and see what a difference it makes.  Unfortunately, this fun game got taken over by some hackers and/or people with such massive egos that it ruins it for most others.  Now it's only fun playing with friends.  Not many purchased the DLC packs so unfortunately when you have multi-player maps on full rotation lots of people fall off when the DLC maps come up.\n\nI hear they plan on releasing more Duke Nukem in the future.  I'm looking forward to it.","December 2, 2013","true","527.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","3"

So you end up gunning down aliens mostly with the triple cannon machinegun.\n\nThe story is purely decorative and the characters flat as a carpet. Half of the time the soldiers are coward and stupid, but that does not make Duke intelligent or brave.\n\nIt could have been a decent shooter but the game is blatantly sexist. Of course it comes with the character, but as far as I remember, all the female characters are either : horny at the mere sight of the Duke, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ providers, incapable of saving themselves, sex workers, alien surrogate mothers begging you to shoot them. I don't recall any female soldiers, scientists or civilians worth noticing. The developers pushed the envelope up to the following point : aliens are only abducting women, so you have to save them!\n\nIs there an irony here? Maybe aliens are in fact abducting women to protect from the Duke? That would have been a hell of a twist!\n\nSo if you're confortable with that level of sexism, Duke Nukem Forever deserved a 6/7 as a shooter. Otherwise it's preferable to ignore it.","February 7, 2015","false","15.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I gave it every chance in the world, and ignored every bit of criticism the game got. First, I'd like to say that at no point was it ever going to live up to the hype that was around the game. It could have came out and been the GOTY and still wouldn't have lived up to the buildup.\n\nWhat the game does right is make long time fans of the franchise nostaligic for the classic games. All of the things that made you love Duke as a character are back. Sadly, the game is tedious to play. It's not fun or that challenging, but it's infuriating for all the wrong reasons. I don't care when games ♥♥♥♥ me off because they're hard. This one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off because of the poor controls and glitches.\n\nI can't recommend buying this game at full price. I would only buy it during a sale at a steep discount, and you'll probably regret not buying one of the other better Duke Nukem games.

The environments and enemies look well enough, certainly not cutting edge but well past the limits of the sixth generation. There's even a small bit of platforming and puzzle solving, such as the remote control cars, running around in miniature, and bouncing inside an alien mother ship. There's lots of items strewn about with which the player can interact, like a fully functioning pinball machine, and boss fights usually depend on some gimmick instead of firepower.\nUnfortunately, none of these distractions are fully realized or satisfying, and only serve to interrupt very claustrophobic gun-play through narrow hallways and trenches. There a plenty of scripted set-pieces that reinforce this sense of linearity, creating spectacle at the expense of freedom, like being lifted by a crane or manning a turret against enemy spacecraft. I enjoy linear games, but the level design here did little to excite me.\nThe other big strike against this game is its personality. For instance, in Duke Nukem 3D, the titular protagonist was fairly quiet except for the occasional musing. Forever is packed with quips, but without any restraint or comedic timing. Lines like "I've got balls of fail" or "Strange silicon-based life form" wear out their welcome immediately, and the title is full of such groaners.\nOther stabs at humor and shock value are more questionable. When playing through an organic alien lair, the walls are decorated with disembodied breasts. Here, the player finds abductees who have been implicitly ♥♥♥♥♥ and thus impregnated with enemy fetuses. The player may either euthanize these women or allow said monsters to incubate. While I can appreciate the "No-win" scenario, the whole scene felt extremely sadistic and underscores the problems with the game's mean-spirited attitude. I didn't buy Duke Nukem Forever to watch women suffer, and after having experienced that I generally feel worse as a person.\nBetween tedious game-play and troubling jokes, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. It's a functional if not boring game stymied by what I consider to be poor taste. If you find yourself defensive or dismissive while reading my review, then you'll probably enjoy this game in part or full. I would not recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Duke Nukem 3D.","December 1, 2013","false","5.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The mythical game that was never to be released.\n\nSadly, it shouldn't of been. Duke Nukem had his time in the 90's; when his particular brand of macho humor was well appreicated and seen for the comedy it was. These days, however, Duke's practically trademark sense of humor is as outdated as it is offensive.\n\nThe game itself plays host to a variety of other mechanics seemingly lifted from other games; mechanics that have since been refined in others, but kept in a very raw form in this game. The overall impression being that the developers ran through a list of potentional game mechanics in a pick'n'mix fashion. That said, the developers have done a wonderful job of keeping the game stable, with no crashes or other problems noted.\n\nBut, if you can look past the seemingly poor gameplay mechanics, and the humor that is so awful it's actually insulting everyone rather than trying to make them laugh...you wind up with a liner first person shooter filled with the reanimated enemies of games long since past and very large amounts of womenfolk who really, REALLY need to put on some damn clothes. It feels like I've been sucked into a 14 year old's wet dream, to be frank.\n\nThis, it seems, is Duke's swan song. He needs to go back into retirement alongside his troupe of scantiliy clad women (that may or may not be aliens) as the gaming community wishes him well.","February 16","false","12.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If you are to pick this game up, you really need to pretend that it came out back in 2009, or maybe even earlier if you want to give the game considerable leeway.\n\nTry this game when it becomes a bargain bin title, as some concepts like the shrunken Duke sections are really neato, but in reality, the game becomes rather defunct once you've beaten the game.\n\nDon't even bother with the multiplayer as dedicated servers haven't even been working since launch, which shows enough how much they cared about it.","June 12, 2011","true","9.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","14"

The major problem with this game is that the unapologetic, brutish and ham-fisted experience is backed up with no substance or any sort of artistic direction. Full of pathetic jokes, flat and blind references, tasteless ignorance and disreputable design choices, this is not worth a sane person's time. While playing this game, you can tell there are 12 year olds out there giggling and clapping as Duke slaps a pair of ♥♥♥♥ on a wall. And that's all this is. It's not true misogyny when it's blurted out by some gun-totting man child with more ♥♥♥♥ jokes than sense. It's a painful, insulting experience that never holds water. Duke is made to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ himself for no reason. He's an ignorant, brash and plain dimwit of a character with all the charm and charisma of a room full of shaved bears covered in ♥♥♥♥. The once golden humor of a man in a silly world filled with quirky enemy designs and kick ♥♥♥ weaponry has all but disappeared. Now it's simply distasteful and rushed. Gameplay is repetitive and boring, guns hold no weight, voice acting is meh (never liked the 'Duke' voice), animation is lack luster and story is near unbearable. I've found strains of plague that are far more appealing.","December 29, 2013","false","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was a joy to see this back in action. Duke still had flare and style that only Duke can have. The Singleplayer  Campaign didn't take very long and was a joy to beat. To be warned there is nudity in this game and adult humor so if your sensitive to that kind of stuff then stay away from this game. The Multiplayer aspect of this game is still active and alot of fun to play with. There are separate in-game achievements for the Multiplayer side of the game. The graphics look not as crisp as today's game but it still does the job. The game is a must have for any Duke Nukem fan, it brings the old enemies into this game and puts more character into them. This was awesome to play and I really enjoyed it.

And to everyone else, even so-called "Duke fans": what more do you really want? 12 more years of waiting? You should be happy that we get to experience any new Dukes at all.\n\nWe get to hear the original voice of Duke, (the amazing) Jon St. John, spout off some more memorable bits of hilarity as you blow chunks of alien viscera all over the place. So what if you have to solve a few harmless puzzles and spend 10 minutes visiting a strip club for a little R&R... because seriously, it's not going to hurt to spend a few moments to rest your thumbs while you either poke around with some mini-games or just see some harmless polygonal t!ts . I mean, comon... polygons or not... enjoy the fact that we're able to enjoy some uncensored entertainment in this twisted country.\n\nMaybe it's because I've been a biased Duke Nukem fan since the days of MS-DOS, or that I really like good old classic non-military-simulating games, because this title is pretty much beyond what I expected for a good modern sequel of an old pixelated classic (not that there's anything wrong with pixels... of course :P).\n\nIf you read all the negative reviews you'll also notice nobody gives a genuine reason why this game is terrible - so why trust their words over mine? All the people I know IRL who bash this game have played it on an outdated, low-perfoming console such as the xbox360 or PS3 (don't even think about correcting me: compared to a good PC, even the xboxONE and PS4 still suck immensely).\n\nIf you're still unsure, then wait until the game is on sale ($5 as of writing this review) or quit being a cheapskate and see what YOU think for yourself. If you've played and enjoyed any of the other Dukes in the past, be it on PC or console, you won't regret your experience with this one.

I can see that this game was rushed out and could have been amazing as some parts are extremely polished, but most are lackluster. The graphics are ancient, the levels virtually empty, half the gameplay is absurdly stupid, the voice acting can't really be called acting and it's the most sexist games I've ever played.

The critics say horrible things about it. But I don't care! The single player story was really fun and varied. It's designed as a continuous adventure, like Half-Life 2 and other modern games (so it's not split into levels). It puts you in the heat of the action with many big guns. It has some puzzle-ish elements too (again comparing to HL2), so it's more than just shooting. Not boring, nicely varied. Examples include driving a monster truck or jumping from a burger to burger in a kitchen while being shrunk. People seem to complain the most about being able to carry only 2 weapons. First of all... they've already added an option to carry 4 weapons, you can find it in the menu. But the game is completly playable and fun keeping the limit set to just 2. You find a lot of guns as you play. Rather than carry it all, find a new one, replace your low ammo weapon. You'll get enough opportunities to fire them all.","July 12, 2012","true","17.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was everything I expected from it. A dumb, over the top shooting game. I'll admit, most of the stuff is boring, it has its moments. The best parts is the stuff between the shooting. Taking down the bosses in an epic way or exploring the areas to see what the developers added for "ego boosts".\n\nWhile I had fun, I have to mention that yes, the platforming was boring and straightforward and that the enemies repetitive and predictable. The bosses were annoying because they can only be hurt by explosive and turrets. So now you have to use weapons with very limited ammo or stay in one play for longer then you would like.\n\nI haven't played any of the previous Duke titles, but you don't need to. If you come into this game expecting a video game equivalent of "The Room" where half the fun is making fun of it, then you'll have a good time. Get into the over the top macho way of thinking and it becomes a fun game where you're left thinking "yes, I just did kick a field goal with a bosses' eye."","August 22, 2014","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are overall not something to write home about, but sometimes I did find myself pleasantly surprised by a certain scene or effect.\n\nFor those of you who played it and didnt think it lives up to the hype, remember, this game was more than a decade in the making, went through a lot of developer issues and outgrew 3 different game engines. Were lucky to have this at all. Also, I invite you to replay the original, it might give you an appreciation for how much they improved some aspects.\n\nBuy it and support Duke, he's gonna need it if we want another one!

If you liked the "old" Duke Nukem games (beginning with Duke 3D), you'll like this one. It's full of manliness, explosions, boobs and humor. Shoot aliens, drive cars, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, and of course ♥♥♥♥ in the sink.\n\nA solid FPS with a good variety of weapons. The one problem I have is (of course) the controls. By default, the "mouse sensitivity" slider is cranked all the way up, and the mouse is nowhere near sensitive enough for shooting aliens. What you have to do is turn off "mouse smoothing." Then it gets a whole lot more sensitive.\n\nAlso: you can only carry a few guns at a time. In the old days of Duke 3D and Doom 2 (I just sat at my keyboard, numb for a full minute, remembering Doom 2), you could carry all the guns at once. Doesn't ruin the game, but makes you play it a little differently.\n\nAnyway: this is my new "I just wanna shoot stuff" blowing off steam game. If you like explosions, boobs, manliness, laughing or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the sink, try the demo.\n\nSeriously. If you don't love boobs, don't play this game. It's not for you.

Not as great as old action movies but sometimes close.\n\nI loved the old feeling - the old level design, weapons, and being stuck for some time which resulted in asking Internet for help on 2-3 occasions - which I really loved, reminded me of good old times. Also, game is quite hard, not like today's games are. Plus, million ingame minigames (pinball etc.).\n\nOh, and how much you will love boss fights!

I do feel that it spends way too much time screwing around instead of letting you actually go out and shoot things.  There are entire chapters of the game that have no shooting and instead just have you wandering around looking for stuff or exploring an environment, and those can get boring very fast.  But when the game remembers that it's supposed to be a first person shooter and lets you shoot some aliens, it's still pretty fun for the most part.  I found the difficulty curve to be a bit off with the bosses;  one boss at around the 3/4ths mark was insanely hard, but then the next boss and the final boss were easy.  Overall, there is some fun to be had here, so if you see it on sale, grab it.

We waited 15 years for this mindless slog. Maybe it's my age maturing (NAHH!!!), maybe it's that the game tries to be DUke Nukem 3d with modern graphics? Maybe cause it was terribly written, terribly directed and terribly made game that would have been more entertaining if never released so we can continue to speculate and make our own stories up,\n\nthis is just a bad game. Be prepared for limiting weapon choices that don't make much sense, don't actually work well and are so boring. Be prepared for running down straight corridors with no choices of any direction in a world that seems to be overly infatuated with Duke and his sexual exploits.\n\nits very rare that a game was better off as vapour ware. But this is one of them.\n\nIf you're a Duke Nukem die hard, Find it on sale so that you can experience it. But the experience will leave you scratching your head wondering "is this really how I remember him?". The one liners here are forced and overused. the sexual innuendo isn't remotely subtle like the first game, and the world is uninspired and unimaginative.\n\n","December 28, 2013","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Campaign took me 11 hrs on hard to finish. The game takes a while to set the pace as the 1st couple of levels have you interacting with the environments/ playing mini-games but it gets progressively better. Difficulty feels uneven at times as there are some difficulty spikes here and there that slow down the pace at which you progress. The game throws a lot of references/ jokes at you with mixed results. Just don't expect highbrow humour from Duke.  All in all if you want to leave your brain at the door and play a fun game that has you chuckling along the way then this title is a prime candidate.","January 17, 2012","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do feel that it spends way too much time screwing around instead of letting you actually go out and shoot things.  There are entire chapters of the game that have no shooting and instead just have you wandering around looking for stuff or exploring an environment, and those can get boring very fast.  But when the game remembers that it's supposed to be a first person shooter and lets you shoot some aliens, it's still pretty fun for the most part.  I found the difficulty curve to be a bit off with the bosses;  one boss at around the 3/4ths mark was insanely hard, but then the next boss and the final boss were easy.  Overall, there is some fun to be had here, so if you see it on sale, grab it.  I got it for $10 and wasn't disappointed at that price.\n\nThis game does earn its M rating though, so be warned if any of the content mentioned in the ESRB decription would offend you.","October 18, 2011","true","22.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are overall not something to write home about, but sometimes I did find myself pleasantly surprised by a certain scene or effect.\n\nFor those of you who played it and didnt think it lives up to the hype, remember, this game was more than a decade in the making, went through a lot of developer issues and outgrew 3 different game engines. Were lucky to have this at all. Also, I invite you to replay the original, it might give you an appreciation for how much they improved some aspects.\n\nBuy it and support Duke, he's gonna need it if we want another one!

What can I say, well the answer to that is that it's a HUGE disappoinment.\n\nWhen I first played the game I was heavily blinded by nostalgia, thus ignoring many of the games issues until I played through it the second time, to which only then did I realise what a colossal piece of sh*t this game was.\n\nNegatives:\n.Low quality textures for a modern game which is not surprising considering it uses the Unreal 2.5 engine but even than I've played games (such as MK vs DC universe) that have utilised the potential of the engine to higher standards\n-For those who are console users I've heard that the console versions of the game suffered from texture pop-ins (essentially the textures are not rendered fast enough on whatever you appear to look at the time.\n.Gameplay, rather than have the fast paced gameplay from its predocessor, DN Forever moves at a more sluggish pace similar to that of most modern FPS such as Halo or Call of Duty, even worse considering that when Duke sprints he tires out within 8 seconds.\n.Regenerative health, aka. the Ego bar.\n.Two weapon limit.\n.Linear level designs, which eliminates level exploration.\n.Boss battles are ridiculously easy as you are essentially given limitless supply of ammunition for the either the rocket launcher or the devastators.\n.Terrible driving mechanics (not surprising since Gearbox were the ones to develop the driving mechanics)\n.Terrible ending.\n.Wall b**bs, WTF!\n\nPositives:\nMost of Duke's one liners are still awesome\nFrom what I've seen from the expansion pack "The Doctor who cloned me" it actually looks fun.\nThe fellow who is friends with Duke is rather funny even if some of his lines are vulgar.\nThe "Content" that a lot fans have wanted to see again in the series.\n\nOverall the game was just a let down and I hope that when 3D realms (The creators of the Duke Nukem series) make the prequel to Duke Nukem 1 known as 'Duke Begins' that they learn from their mistakes so as to avoid making another DN Forever because every fan of the series does not want a bad Duke Nukem game, no fan does.\n\nOverall a 4 out of 10","February 6, 2015","false","24.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ComradeZed/recommended/57900/","ComradeZed","Comrade Zed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ComradeZed/","176 products in account","So, here's the thing... It's Duke Nukem. You can't expect it to seem good to you if you're expecting something serious.\n\nWhile I wasn't a fan of the Duke Nukem games before, because I was born a bit too late and I missed the "Golden Era of DOS Games", I became a fan now. I had finished the game once before, when it just hit the market, but I wasn't very impressed, mostly because of the reason mentioned earlier.\n\nHowever, the game grew on me, and I decided to buy it for myself and finish it on the hardest difficulty - which I'm currently working on.\n\nI always choose to play 3D shooters on the hardest difficulty because the harsh challenge makes the game extremely fun, and the more difficult it is to finish the game, the more rewarding the feeling you get when you finally manage to do it. Besides, even when played on "Come Get Some", the game seemed pretty easy to me, most of the time. The real challenge comes when you're able to play it on Insane. A piece of advice: arm yourself with a very good weapon besides the rocket launcher or the devastator when you're going to fight the Octaking. It is by far the most difficult boss battle in the entire game.\n\nSo, why didn't I like the game when I first played it? Well, like I said, it had to do with the overall immature style of it, but I wasn't aware it was supposed to be immature. If that was also your first impression, give it another chance and play it on a hard difficulty. Trust me, you'll love it! Played like that it's an old school shooter at its finest.\n\nOh, and by the way, I think the shrink ray is actually trying to make another reference - like many others you will find during your playthrough, and it's intentionally made to look like something right out of Portal. It's Duke Nukem humour... I guess you have to be a fan to understand it. :)\n\nBeing a fan of old school 3D shooters, I'd give it a 10/10.","January 7, 2015","true","25.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The basic shooting mechanic was a lot of fun.  I never got bored during the enemy encounters.  Some were really frustrating, but I was always able to get through by changing tactics.  It's full of great interactive bits like working air hockey and pinball games.  I was laughing so hard when I started drawing on a whiteboard and an NPC commented on it.  The later half of the game that was all about fighting aliens and making references to games and movies I like was great.  I wish they'd just done that.  Then I could give it a whole-hearted thumbs-up.","November 8, 2015","false","60.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wanted to LOVE this game. 20 minutes in I figured I would settle for just liking the game (after all there was a lot of promise of T and A). But there is a serious lack of oomph behind anything in this game. In a genre that is as saturated as FPS you need more than just nostalgia for 10 year old game. The dialogue... it's hard to describe how flat it is. I remember when the original first came out. I was blown away by the sound effects and Duke Nukem talked! It was amazing, but standards have changed since Duke first came on the scene and the devs fell short. I hate giving a thumbs down to a game especially one I haven't completed but with all the games in my library and my limited time to play. I just can't force myself to play something I am not enjoying at all.\n","November 6, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And that is saying a lot for a sequel to a decade and a half old video game. Unejoyable, contrieved and hackneyed, with boring nad unispiring gameplay & level design.

You have a game with uneven pacing, poor animations and dated graphics, iffy sound design and questionable levels of polish. The reality is that if this did not bear the Duke Nukem name it would be on no one's radar.

What can I say, well the answer to that is that it's a HUGE disappoinment.\n\nWhen I first played the game I was heavily blinded by nostalgia, thus ignoring many of the games issues until I played through it the second time, to which only then did I realise what a colossal piece of sh*t this game was.\n\nNegatives:\n.Low quality textures for a modern game which is not surprising considering it uses the Unreal 2.5 engine but even than I've played games (such as MK vs DC universe) that have utilised the potential of the engine to higher standards\n-For those who are console users I've heard that the console versions of the game suffered from texture pop-ins (essentially the textures are not rendered fast enough on whatever you appear to look at the time.\n.Gameplay, rather than have the fast paced gameplay from its predocessor, DN Forever moves at a more sluggish pace similar to that of most modern FPS such as Halo or Call of Duty, even worse considering that when Duke sprints he tires out within 8 seconds.\n.Regenerative health, aka. the Ego bar.\n.Two weapon limit.\n.Linear level designs, which eliminates level exploration.\n.Boss battles are ridiculously easy as you are essentially given limitless supply of ammunition for the either the rocket launcher or the devastators.\n.Terrible driving mechanics (not surprising since Gearbox were the ones to develop the driving mechanics)\n.Terrible ending.\n.Wall b**bs, WTF!\n\nPositives:\nMost of Duke's one liners are still awesome\nFrom what I've seen from the expansion pack "The Doctor who cloned me" it actually looks fun.\nThe fellow who is friends with Duke is rather funny even if some of his lines are vulgar.\nThe "Content" that a lot fans have wanted to see again in the series.\n\nOverall the game was just a let down and I hope that when 3D realms (The creators of the Duke Nukem series) make the prequel to Duke Nukem 1 known as 'Duke Begins' that they learn from their mistakes so as to avoid making another DN Forever because every fan of the series does not want a bad Duke Nukem game, no fan does.\n\nOverall a 4 out of 10","February 6, 2015","false","24.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Duke is the least PC mainstream franchise, and it's akin to hanging out with that ex-jock dude from high school that hurls awful jokes all the time. But no matter how you wouldn't introduce the guy to your parents, SO, or people from work, you can't deny you mostly have fun with the guy. Sure, you switch your brain off, and you're not going to have any meaningful discussions with the guy any time soon, and it won't overall, turn you into a better person, but you have fun with the guy, and that's all that actually matters, that's the whole reason you hang out with him.\n\nTL;DR: Critics want you to hate this game, so they can appear more sophisticated, mature and "feminist". Overall, more PC. This is not true feminism though; to focus on one aspect and single it out without pointing out the whole premise, including the main character, is a parody of stereotypes is witch hunting, not feminism. The game itself is above mediocre. Not the best shooter of all time, but it's very far from the worst.\n\nPS: Ignore the playtime, I've completed the game on a console.","January 2","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, Gearbox probably tried their best to save this trainwreck, but so many years of development and the cult status of DN3D/Atomic meant only thing, this will not live up to the hype. And it didn't.\n\nDuke Nukem Forever is a huge step backwards and does not even live up to the quality standard of its predecessor.  And that is saying a lot for a sequel to a decade and a half old video game. Unejoyable, contrieved and hackneyed, with boring nad unispiring gameplay & level design. This attempt to remake Duke as a modern 21st century action hero is not worth your time or the effort.","November 6, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are many flaws, like the fact that the single-player is full of useless things, the health (ego) recharges by itself, you can only carry 2 weapons and there is for sure not so much action like in Duke Nukem 3D. But it's fun to play.\nThe multiplayer was not designed for competitiveness, but for having fun when you have nothing to do. In fact, everybody can kill everybody.\n\nIn other words, if you want to kick asses, play Duke Nukem 3D.
