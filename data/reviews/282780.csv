Holy moly, I can't tell you how good it felt to be clapped after each level, I haven't been clapped to that hard since I was 12, and the woo's. what joyous woo's.\n\nThis game, I personally consider, to be somewhat of a cross between Metal Slug (with less enemies) and that 2005 flash game, stick adventure or whatever, y'know the one. It takes the elements of a stick adventure, adds guns and explosions and then slaps a helicopter with a rocket launcher in your face, in 5 minutes of playing. Although the enemies could have been harder and more diverse this game still put up a challenge for me as I failed miserably to land on a bunch of god damn whales that didn't want any of it. Along with these juicy elements it also ads in the ability to ride freaking clouds (sort of) and to deflect bullets with a sword. You can also change the colour of your stick man and his clothes which ads the slightest personal element of sorts to it.\n\nAlthough the game isn't a Final Fantasy length release it's still a bunch of fun while you're playing through it, if you'd like to have a look at this game before you purchase it yourself I made a 10 minute video showing you the action of this game and the good times it brings as I enjoyed it so much, if you'd like to view that feel free to here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7rULqOtXZM&feature=youtu.be","July 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 43 of 59 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","43","59","8","1"

As long as the developer keeps working on the game it will always keep me playing. Looking at the game, I think a level editor would be amazing and could really help keep people in the game with nonstop levels from the community.

The first Stick 'Em Up game was an Xbox indie game. Of how quite cheap it was, it offered a lot of things. It featured a somewhat long campaign, as well as a level editor, which with the level editor, there was so many opportunities.\n\n..Well, unfortanetly, Stick Em Up 2 is completley different. Although the game looks much better than the first one, it pretty much abandoned the reason why it was good; It's level editor. They removed the level editor, as well as shortened the campaign. The first game had about 12 levels or so, this game only has 6... Like really? 6..? I literally beat the whole game within 20 minutes, and I feel that I won't want to play anymore, when I could play the first game for tons of hours.\n\nAn update better come soon featuring that level editor, otherwise, don't waste your money on this game. The game's story is fun, but it's definitely not worth $2.99..\n\nUntil they bring the map editor back, I won't recommend this game. Taking away something for what a game was best known for is a pretty bad move.","July 28, 2015","false","0.5"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","24","45","4","0"

The next day, I bought the game, and 20 minutes later I am writing this review.\n\n\nI'm going to start by saying that the rest of the game is nothing like the demo. In the demo you get a machine gun and you get to fly a helicopter with rockets. You don't see these again for the rest of the game.\n\nNext level you have stars which become a span fest.\n\nThen you are driving forward for a minute in a space buggy (That's the whole level, holding down right and tilting a tiny bit. And if your buggy gets wrecked, you get to do nothing but run for a while, all the while, things are falling from the sky to kill you.) At the end you get a rocket ship which all you do is fly up and that’s you done. (If the game even registers you as completing the level).\n\nThere's another space buggy level.....less this time, nothing to kill you and no rocket ship, just drive right.\n\nA level where you have to jump across pirate ships while deflecting bullets and slicing through baddies. In reality, you are just swinging every few seconds while guessing if the whale is there or not.\n\nThe final level was a nightmare, you are climbing through trees armed with a spear. A spear that is very annoying to use, but the AI seem to have been training with them all of their life. Also, the glitchyness of jumping often sends you off the edge. The game goes from super easy to hard in just one level.\n\nI really wanted to buy this game and get a game where I could just sit back and have a bit of silly fun. I didn't expect a long game, but 20 minutes to beat it is bad. I wanted to enjoy his, I really did. If there are updates to the game adding future levels then I will happily come back to the game to play some more.","July 28, 2015","false","0.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","1"

I used to have this on the Xbox so was pretty chuffed to play it again here. This is my first purchase on Steam too and so far im pretty impressed with how it works. Stick Em Up 2 is a primarily a platformer but there's actually quite a lot of variation to the gameplay, you get a different weapon on each level and they really dictate the way you have to play the game.\n\nThe first level opens with a quick tutorial and a few basic jumps to get you used to the controls and then its straight into the action. The controls took a minute to get used to (Im playing on my keyboard and mouse) but I soon found myself galloping along and unleashing a sea of bullets on the unsuspecting stick-baddies. The weapon you start with is a machine gun with unlimited ammo, which is pretty handy. Half way through you get to fly a helicopter with a rocket launcher which is obviously extremely badass. The second stage is set in Japan and the soundtrack is really cool, ancient Japanesey music. The weapon here is a ninja star and you have to change your tactics a little bit, if you try and rush through like you did in the first level you'll be massacred in no tiime. The trick I found was to progress slowly and pick the enemies off one by one like a ninja. Theres a massive house at the end of this stage which looks like something out of a 70s Kung Fu flick and you need to scale your way right to the very top to get off the level.\n\nSomehow the next level takes place on the moon. Stars are falling out of the sky and these stars are not your friend, they hate you and they want to kill you. This level is all about firing a continious barrage of missiles up at the sky at the falling stars and running past whenever you get a tiny gap. Level 4 has our stickman fighting pirates at sea. You jump from ship to ship, via whales, slashing the armed occupants to smithereens with just a trusty sword and your wits. Again the weapon really dictates the gameplay here, it IS possible to kill the baddies hand to hand with the sword but the safest way is to use the sword to deflect their own bullets right back at them. I like the idea that our stickman is so incredibly hard he can kill 20 badguys with guns using just a sword. He is a double-hard barsteward and no mistake. Oh yeah and theres a canon on one of the ships which you can comandeer. Its not exactly fair to shoot the enemies at point blank range with a canonball, but it IS fun.\n\nLevel 5 finds us back on the moon, thankfully there's no stars this time but there is a moon buggy for us to drive. It's pretty much a straight time trial race against the clock. I can't stress how awesome this level is, blasting along with the accelerator planted to the floor trying to keep the buggy on its wheels. Each difficulty setting gives you a completely different track too, so theres sort-of 3 levels built into 1 here. This is one of those mini-games that you accidentally spend an hour or 2 on, especially in multiplayer. The last level is this weird kind of Ewok treehouse city and the weapon is a javelin thing that you can charge up. It takes a second to get to maximum charge and it's pretty satisfying unleashing it close-range on the poor unsuspecting stick baddies - its goes straight through them - and if theres 2 or 3 standing in close quarters you can kill all 3 with one spear, which aside from being great fun also shows our stickman is very frugal and even in these violent times, has one eye on the environment. The other theme of this level is BIG jumps. Some of them seem only just possible, which I personally really like in a platformer.\n\nOne of the coolest things about the game for me is the varied gameplay, each of the 6 levels really has its own unique vibe and you need to adjust your playing technique accordingly to progress. The other thing that stands out is the sound which is truly EPIC, these tunes will stick in your head (In a good way) and I actually hope they put the soundtrack out at some point, I would definately pay another $3 just for the tunes. Some things I would really like to see updated in the future: More levels, especially the moon buggy levels (This needs its own game) and maybe some more flying in the moon rover, that was over way too quick. I found the difficulty level was gauged pretty good, theres 3 settings and the hardest really is very challenging - you get one life and you cant take much damage at all - but even so, its not impossible so you never get too frustrated. Also theres the various achievements to unlock, which I havnt really gotten into them yet but they seem to range from amusing to insane, like the pacifist one which you get by somehow going through the entire game without shooting anyone!\n\nAnyway a very good game & totally worth the $3!","July 29, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Xbox controller works, but the aiming is really hard to do and you cannot rebind, you have to jump with the left trigger. So I tried playing with keyboard and mouse, but I hate WASD and you cannot rebind those either. There is some potential here with the variety in each level, and the silly humour with the moonbuggy and the jumping on clouds, but all in all my conclusion is: NO.","July 28, 2015","false","0.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"
