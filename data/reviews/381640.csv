Ask anyone of them you know, or just trust me with this purely honest opinion.\nIt is pay 2 win. That's it, the most iconic and terrible example of such business model. Anti-control PvP buffs? Check. Increasing your damage output and protection with real money? Check. Cash-only mounts and food for them, to just make them move(!)? Check. This list goes on an on, but i think you got the point.\nOn the other hand, it has a unique art style and absolutely amasing music, both made in russian and soviet folklore style and looking/sounding just wonderful. But if you somehow manage to get futher starting zones - pay 2 win waving his hand to get your attention. And it will, no doubt.\nI honestly DO NOT recommend this game to any person who still in friends with his mind. Though you can try it just to get a glimpse of a music and art. After that - "RUN, YOU FOOLS!"\nI rate this game 9 runes out of 40 billion donated "crystals".","January 27","false","0.1"," 735 of 882 people (83%) found this review helpful 84 people found this review funny","83","735","882","84","44"

With a big budget, nice graphics and an interesting storyline it promised to be a great and riveting adventure. And so it was, but only during the 1.0 version of the game (as I like to call it "vanilla" allods) because at first there was no cash shop. It got introduced later into the beta, but it didn't upset the balance that much, yet.\nThen comes the first big expansion which forced quite a lot of cash shop stuff into the game making it borderling unplayable for non paying players. Even if you decided to be supportive, and buy the cash shop currency from time to time, you usually found yourself wondering if its worth it. Cash shop aside, at least the content was fun during this phase! But that was quick to change.\nSoon further expansions arrived, making the game more and more into a unfun tedious grind which required even more money invested than before to play properly, or nerves of steel if you were a free player (farming is not fun I tell you).\n\nIn my opinion the game is now a shell of its former self and not worth getting into. Yes it is true, many people spent thousands - some even 10 thousands of euros/dollars/whatever currency on this game.\n\nIf you are a new player looking for a fun temporary MMO then I can recommend this game to you. Download it and play it (but don't bother paying). Levels 1-40 will probably be the most fun, and then you'll feel the fun gradually drop off as you climb towards the max level, and then you quit. That's the only thing this MMO got to offer.\n\nI guess the original devs leaving early on did make an impact after all...\n\nTL;DR - Pay2win concept taken to the extreme, probably one of - if not the worst example of pay2win (or should i say pay2lottery and pray4win?) ruining a good game which had a lot of potential","January 27","false","0.1"," 257 of 303 people (85%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","85","257","303","14","2"

The game was really fun, good music, good characters and classes.\nWhen they introduced the cash shop, everyone recieved a nerf. You were pretty much 40% less powerful then the day before, and the only way to get back to 100% was to go with cash shop items. And they were on a time limit.\nMost people bailed at that point and some stuck around to see if it would be rebalanced. But I left when it was pretty certain not to happen.\nSeems like it was put on steam to try and milk a few more dollars from people who aren't aware.","January 27","false","0.1"," 171 of 214 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","171","214","8","1"

Well, I updated my review:\n+ story (+references in game on russian history).\n+ graphic (it looks really nice).\n+ gameplay (it comfortable and practical).\n+ race (I just love only gibberlings from all races).\n\n- donations (this ♥♥♥♥ is killing all game, because if you want to rise in PvE/PvP you need waste money, if you want anything you need buy it for real money, other people doing it and you need to be competitive in game; it's a trap, where there is one exit - delete game).\n- content (content is really small and you cant enjoy this: all you have are raid(including old with skills for you), astral (local main element), solo dungeon (if you dont have friends(joke)) and battlegrounds (as in any mmorpg) and it is all, no anymore).\n- system requirements (you can have lags on strong machine).\n\nIn general, game is not bad, but I can say honest,your play without real money will not interesting absolutely, but now, when server started few days ago, you can play without hard problems with other people. Just wait, when people will start to donation in game.\n_____________________________________________________________\n\n[My story in this game, it is my way.]\n\nI'm old player in this game. I started to play since 2010, when was OBT.\n\nIt was perfect, I wasted so much hours, that I cant calculate it. So many people I saw, so many events was in game and it was amazing.\nI cant fargot world PvP on locations (it was funny, very funny), where now you cant meet people, because people not playing anymore.\nI had guild, where I rose, where I met people, who came in my life and became friends.\n\nI really lived in this world, but MONEY. Money killed all, that I appreciated in game.\nNow, I have character with good donat things, but game is rip for me. I'm not playing anymore in this game, but I really tryed to return so many times.\nAs I see, you cant return if you want, because you havent so much money, you havent people with this, you havent time for this and wish.\n\nI really hope, that you will not play in this game. Today game is not good for players, you need to have 50 000 dollars, if you want to be someone in this world.\n\nP.S. Good luck, if you want to live in game, but remember, that gold times were in 2010-2011 years.","January 27","false","0.1"," 100 of 129 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","100","129","6","0"

Allods Online is one of those games that starts out great and slowly and, seemingly inevitably falls pay to win. As much as the peak time for playing Allods has passed, lower pop, more pay to win days ahead you can still find fun in Allods. The style is something I don't feel anyone has really replicated well, one of the more unique free to play MMO's from around 2010.\n\nIn Allods you start by picking your race, the two factions each have three races. The races of the Empire are Orcs, Xadaganians (Empire Humans), and the Arisen (aka Russian Necrons). The races of the League are the Elves, the Kanians (League Humans), and the Gibberlings. These Gibberlings need a bit of an explanation. You see the Gibberlings are one of the most unique races I have seen playable in an mmo because you play three of them, at once all animated together! Gibberlings are pretty much tiny 2 foot tall badger people, they fight and live in groups of three, so for every action they work together to accomplish they each have there own role to play. As an example if you chose a sword and shield class chances are your Gibberlings will have be carrying a sword, one with a shield and one running around doing anything else!. Don't worry though, Gibberlings are not "micro" heavy, its only the animations that are fun and exotic, otherwise they play like any other character.\n\n\nThe classes of Allods Online are broken down into archetypes, each archetype reflecting a slightly different class per race. the archetypes are Warrior, Paladin, Scout, Healer, Warden, Mage, Summoner, Psionicist. Not every race can play every archetype.\n\n\n\nA bit of background lore now, in Allods an a time long past there was a terrible cataclysm that sundered the worlds into islands and nations that float through the "Astral". The Astral functions like a primitives idea of space, filled with energy that you can traverse with Astral ships, sailing from one world or island to the next. This is one of the more attractive features of Allods Online, and while I wont go into it heavily here, it has much bearing on end game. You will learn more about Astral and the history of the world if you play Allods.\n\n\n\nOverall I have to say I really do enjoy Allods even if it is pay to win now in 2016. I hope at some time in the future we get the english version of the game available on Steam!","January 27","true","0.3"," 68 of 151 people (45%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","45","68","151","6","6"
