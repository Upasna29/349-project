The only real thing on my mind? Firing up the Commodore 64 and rejoining the bunch of Desert Rangers that have just escaped from their first encounter with the Scorpitron. Clips of various calibres were burnt through, LAW rockets fired, two mortally injured - but the team survived. Just.\n\nHow had this game got to captivate me so much? To this day, Wasteland ranks as my No.1 game of all time. Not a maybe, not a floating possibility amongst five other great games - but the clear front runner and sole contender. One that I doubt will ever be usurped in the immediate and all-consuming effect that wandering into the radioactive barrens of the American mid-West had on me.\n\nWasteland is a top-down RPG that follows the 'good guys' of Desert Rangers - attempting to put right the wrongs and work out what strange events are happening in post-nuclear desert around Las Vegas. Fully customisable characters are still fun today, but in late 1988, this was unheard of. Brawlers, pistoleros, ranged specialists to hi-tech geeks were all here - including murderous cyborgs, dodgy gamblers, bar owners and lethal, radioactive vermin. Wasteland introduced the options of restraint, or over-kill - depending on your mood and temperament. Do you carefully take a single shot at your target? Or burst fire of a trio of bullets? Or to hell with accuracy and lead count and simply rip through a magazine? Your ammo, your choice.\n\nA newcomer to Wasteland in 2014 will be woefully unimpressed. What's all the fuss about? It looks archaic has virtually no sound and the main storyline can be completed in a very short time span. But a quarter of a century ago, this game shattered the adventure genre apart and set a whole new level of benchmark. The highly influenced offspring of the Fallout games show plenty of direct lineage back to the original game. But none enthrall in quite the same way that Wasteland did.\n\nEven Steam refers to Wasteland 1 as 'The Original Classic'. For those lucky enough to have been around on its first release - that phrase sums it up perfectly.\n\n10 out of 10.","May 9, 2014","true","0.1"," 181 of 204 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","181","204","6","0"

This game brought rpg's from the dungeons to bombed-out cities and deserts. This was one of the first games to have memory and be able to save your progress, so when you made a change in the game world by killing someone or doing a mission it stayed that way! If you've never played this game I'll tell you about it. You're going to need imagination, like a lot of it. Because of limitations of Commador 64 this game relies on descriptive writing to give you a picture of whats happening in and out of combat. You'll need to when fighting with your party to find the right rhythm of attaking, dodging, and relaoding. Just like the first fallouts and most old rpg's, don't get to mad if a rat takes you down early on.\n\n\n\n\nOver all if you want to play this make sure you know what you're getting, this is 26 years old.

Wasteland surprisingly has a good atmosphere and sometimes I can actually imagine the rangers fighting off hoardes of robots or leather jerks; I can really immerse myself in this game despite how "dated" it may be. You have a wide variety of skills and attributes to use at your disposal for any situation you may find yourself in, and this being an Interplay game, there are some weird spots you'll find yourself in. The variety / diversity helps make the world and your characters feel more immersive and more in-control. An example is at the bar in Quartz. You can hop onto a stage and get into a battle sequence, only to be forced to preform for the audience afterwards. So you have your charisma attribute and some skills like knife throw to entertain the audience before they let you back down, but if your skills are too low or if you're just unlucky, you're going to find yourself being pelted with tomatos and beer bottles.\n\nI love the quirkiness of the game, it reminds me of the Fallout universe which is inspired by this game and also made by Interplay. The wastes are a strange place, with settlements ran by strange people, such as Faran Brygo. (obviously referencing Brian Fargo) You'll even find yourself dealing with the occult in this game, something having to do with an item called the "bloodstaff". I won't spoil anything though.\n\nDid I mention you can get Wasteland Herpes from a 3-legged hooker?\n\nThe combat in this game is nothing special. It's simple and entertaining enough, but sometimes you find yourself running into encounter after encounter and it's so annoying. Also, if you don't memorize the keyboard shortcuts or put the macro creator to good use (ctrl+function), you're going to find yourself dealing with an annoying, clunky layout. Besides the minor annoyance, it won't be hard to learn.\n\nThere's not really much to say about this game, it's a classic and rightfully so. I'm not a huge RPG guy but this is an RPG I find myself coming back to every now and again because of how much fun it is. It has an easy to follow story, atmopsheric enviornments, great music, great characters and dialogue, and that wasteland quirkiness we all know and love. I definitely recommend this game to anybody looking to play a great retro RPG, or anyone who's interested in the origin of Wasteland / Fallout.\n\n\nAlso, if you haven't picked it up already, be glad it's $5.99 and not the $14.99 I spent when it was first released on steam... well, I'd say the $14.99 was well worth it.","September 8, 2015","true","77.4"," 58 of 64 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","58","64","5","1"

No clerics to raise your dead back to life, no instant magical healing and no one to hold your hand and tell you where to go. Wasteland had no qualms about letting you try to go where you please and if you could survive then by all means break the sequence and go exploring.\n\nThe storyline may seem simple compared to gems that came a decade later, but it still stands up far better than most other rpgs of its era and indeed a good deal of the ones we've seen today. It was hard, it was unforgiving, it expected you to think and take your own notes and it was great, this is what rpgs were in the late 80s and it's defintely not for everyone especially if you've been raised on modern games the whole time you've been playing.\n\nBut, if you're patient, if you can look beyond 16 color Enhanced Graphics Adapter art, if you can handle having to read things and keep track of information on your own, then maybe, just maybe you're cut out to be a Desert Ranger.","November 25, 2013","true","7.7"," 75 of 94 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","75","94","0","4"

For whatever my opinion may be worth, I hereby go on record to state that this is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. Of course, that bold statement does come with a couple of caveats: first, my thoughts may very well be colored by nostalgia to a fair degree; and second, I haven't actually played this game in over 20 years, so it's entirely possible I am just forgetting all the bad parts. At any rate, if you are into RPGs, classic games, or at all interested in revisiting the early days of PC gaming, this is one of the very few games that should be near the top of anyone's "must-play someday" list. While I can't guarantee playing this game will captivate and inspire you the same way it did for people back in the day, I am at least fairly confident that the game itself is probably fundamentally solid, even if the underlying technology and graphics don't hold up. So definitely give this a look if you're open to embracing "the classics", or if you're just an old man like me pining for the good old days.","November 14, 2013","true","0.1"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","44","57","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, it was par for the course at the time. But compared to it's spiritual successor Fallout and basically any modern game. Playing it today will make it apparent how dated the game is.\n\nWhile dated is a very strong word to throw at this game, if you've played a tabletop RPG in your lifetime and have an afternoon to kill Wasteland is a fairly engaging game. It portrays a post apocalyptic wasteland fairly well, and it has a lot of personality.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DOT44/recommended/259130/","DOT44","[DOT]Fox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DOT44/","623 products in account","Review: So here I am playing a RPG Text-Adventure game from 1988 (I guess I should mention that I have not yet played too many CRPGs) - and well, i knew games from back then were rather complicated compared to the newer games and it happens that you get stuck and dont really know what to do to go on. But surprisingly it only took me a while (okay to be honest i watched a gameplay video or two :p ) to get into the game mechanics and I started to really enjoy the game. The game plays pretty well and compared to the original DOS version the steam version has nicer Aesthethics like redone artworks (sadly not animated like in the DOS version tho) and Built-In game documentary (that even gets read to you). From the Game mechanics side, I did not experience any Bugs, only some difficulties (my party missed alot in the beginning and there are places where the direction that you use your Skills in matters where - in my opinion - it shouldnt. Also when the mayority of your party is unconcious you end up in a never ending cycle of a fight until you eventually die). The game Dynamics went pretty smoothly aswell but you kind of have to know what skills you need have in the beginning whn creating your own characters.\n\nSo here are my personal Pros and Cons about the game:\n\nPros:   + What the game lacks in graphics it makes up in Storytelling and Gameplay\n+ Alot of fun and addicting gameplay\n+ For the read-lazy people: The Game-Documentary has voiceovers (but then again: Is a game like this for read-lazy people at all? Either way I like how they did the Voiceovers :3)\n+ Its the Grandfather of all Post-Apocalyptic RPGs... i mean that should be reason enough to play it!\n+ Good Humor\n\nNeutral:  - Needs some getting used to but honestly you cant really blame the game for it\n- You get pretty much thrown into cold water at the beginning and have a hard time figuring out where to go but hey cant go wrong with the nearest visible town, right? (Cold start is kind of like in Skyrim to give you some example to compare to... Good for emergent gameplay and I like that but I would just like to atleast get to know a bit of background knowledge PRO-TIP: The documentary gives you some hints about what is going on)\n\nCons: - Small tileset because they wanted to save up on disk-space back when the game was created... i was told it fitted onto 2 Floppys (why do bunnies look the same as opossums tho ;w; <- and yes these are enemies, and no they dont want to be cuddled, trust me i tried and died)\n- Like I mentioned in my Review above there are parts where you can get stuck if you dont know some things (simple things mostly but you really need to know them)\n\nTips and Hints:\n\n>Try to get a high IQ-stat when creating your character and skill them wisely (the highest of any stat is 18)\nfor example the Perception skill lets you "see" things that you cant see directly...\n>Your CON (Constitution/Hit-Points) regenerates over time. You should search for safe places to "rest". Time passes\nwhen you do any Action: this includes Moving, "View" whatever that does, holding down ESC.\n>Dont get frustrated when you get stuck... it happens occasionally. Try to search the web and/or try things out.","January 18, 2015","true","12.2"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","1"

Me and my friends would huddle around the computer and play coop before it even existed. Each of us created unique characters inside of Ranger Station slamming on the SPACEBAR forever to roll up the best stats and get the best points. We essentially would play cooperatively on 1 computer where we would take turns actually using the computer. The player would type and move around, while the other people simply watched the game and spoke aloud what they wanted their characters to do. "Attack, Burst, Leather Thug to the left". "Disband, move up." This last statement our close combat character would literally say 100 times each session. It  was all part of the fun, and while it sounds  painful, it was actually a blast. We'd make our party consisting of a "gun guy", a "brawler", a "doc", and a "nerd".\n\nThe gun guy we'd load up with gun skills like SMG and Assault Rifle (M1989A1 NATOs baby!) and AT Weapon, this guy was clutch for making sure he shot and actually hit stuff in the game, where even if you have a really good DEX stat you might not hit what you shoot unless you take the skill too.\n\nThe brawler would get pugilism and melee weapon skills (basically a tank in close quarter combat) and of course he'd get dibs on the Manglers and Clubs and stuff. Of course he never really relied only on melee and could take out some punks at a distance with a .45 or whatever. The doc is well, a medic with loads of Medic skill and a ridiculous INT stat, and the nerd was a well-rounded character that had a maximum INT but took skills that were not medic; forgery, metallurgy, lockpick, etc.\n\nIT IS NOT EASY\nI can't tell you how many hours of my life I spent huddled in front of the glow of my color composite monitor swapping disks playing Wasteland. It is a brutally difficult game by todays standards with permadeth period. No options for ressurection unless you save your game ahead of time, when you die you're dead. Perhaps part of what made this game so compelling to me and my friends was that we actually had to focus, use our brains for team work, and have a strategy instead of just mindless button mashing like we were doing on our NESes with Rush'n'Attack, Rygar, and Ikari Warriors (among others). We would die often and we would regroup and rethink of our strategy. We would pick better skills learn more about the attributes and when they played a role and for what and this whole time we were actually having a boatload of fun. I can remember TPD (total party death) once we reached Las Vegas (♥♥♥♥ I remember this happening in Quartz too, the game is freaking hard and the deck is definitely not stacked in your favor) as we got shredded to pieces by a cyborg with energy weapons (up until then we didn't even know energy weapons existed). It took hours to rebuild, start over, and level up to be strong enough to get back to Las Vegas and actually take those bots down.\n\nAND WE CHEATED\nWe used to build 4 characters in Ranger Station, only 1 of which would we actually try to make decent. This character was the "courier" he would be escorting the cannon fodder other 3 characters straight to Quartz, where they would sell EVERY piece of gear they owned, then he'd Pool the money and walk them back to Range Station, and we'd delete them. Do this 100 - 300 times, and you can amass an enormous cache of weapons, armor, money, etc. Then when  you have your loot and gear all sorted, you build 3 other characters and you give a ♥♥♥♥ about them too. After those 3, we would give the couriers ♥♥♥♥ to another remaning character either kill the courier to create a better character, or sometimes we'd just keep him. We used macros to automate most of this. In essence, this is cheating against the spirit of the game, but it was ♥♥♥♥ing  hard and we were young and thought we were clever. I can tell you even then it wasn't always easy after. Yes we might have SMG's and NATO Assault rifles with boatloads of clips and TNT and Kevlar armor, but we still got our asses handed to us in Vegas.\n\nWE NEVER BEAT IT\nWe got ver close to beating the game, but we could never find the Sleeper Base to make it to space.\n\nIT IS OLD THOUGH...\nI know, right? It' s pretty old, and it doesn't age super well. If you didn't grow up playing this game you might hate it. If you can get past the old-ness of the game, the graphics even with this re-release are not great, the SA antialiasing helps, but I kinda like the crunchy pixels better. The music and the voice overs are pretty awesome in this version; we had a paragraph book we'd use to read from (which doubled as a form of copy protection).\n\nIf you like oldschool RPGs that are top-down (like Ultima, or 2400AD) and you are ready to commit to actually trying to win (if that's your thing) and don't mind getting your ♥♥♥ whipped until you learn some tricks and techniques, this game will reward you.\n\nThere is a lot of game in ths small package, and there is a lot of personality and character that this game had that no other game did. EA innovated on many fronts with Wasteland, and not just in the computer but the paragraphs really added a ton of story and immersion to the game that other RPGs of the time lacked sorely. It was like living in the best "Choose Your Own Adventure" (don't get be started about how awesome those books were in my childhood) computer game ever made.\n\nTHIS WAS WHAT STARTED THE FALLOUT(s)\nIf you're a fan of Fallout at all, you will probably like this game. It takes time and dedication, but this is the precursor to all the others. For that reason alone you should check it out, but the game has tons of merit as well, and the re-release really does try to polish an old title to a more modern standard. I think it does a pretty good job, but I had some issues getting the mouse to work. The keyboard is the way to go and it works no problem.\n\nGIVE IT A SHOT I RECOMMEND IT\nYou needed an imagination in the old days, and you still need it today, but the voice overs really do help make this game a lot better than it was. The music is OK too. Is it going to blow your mind? Probably not. Is it going to keep you coming back, maybe. Is it going to make you work for the reward of the story? Without a doubt.\n\nWasteland is one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it.","November 30, 2013","true","1.9"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","5"

This is because that game was released in the era of computing known as The Bad Old Days, where you had to manually configure your PCI/ISA cards to avoid IRQ conflicts, where you had to make DOS Bootdisks to free up enough memory just to get the damn video game running, where you could write a little graphical menu in DOS where you could park the heads of your incredibly expensive 10 MB hard drive. You know, just in case the FBI comes around to ask you why you've been pirating so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ software to the rest of your Warez buddies on the BBS networks. Computer users had to put up with a lot of ♥♥♥♥ just to get games like Wasteland running, and so games like these were walks in the park compared to knowing the exact DOS commands to Telnet into the Matrix or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that.\n\nThis version of the game runs entirely in a custom emulation environment. It includes a custom soundtrack written by a fan which is pretty cool. The game also allows you to read the paragraphs inside the game (complete with voice overs) when it asks you to read paragraph 38 or another random arbitrary number. The storytelling is pretty good. Other than that, it's pretty much just like the old PC version, which is as accessible to new players as noise music is to regular people. It will definitely make the old, bearded crowd sigh and reminisce about The Bad Old Days.\n\nI recommend you give this about five hours, read a summary and the paragraph book, and then wait for Wasteland 2 to finish up.","July 7, 2014","true","5.0"," 47 of 71 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","47","71","0","2"

You can open closed door with the lockpicking ability, or you use the climb skill, or force it open with a crowbar or blow it up with a rocket launcher.\n\nYour group starts with four people and can be extended to seven members by recruiting certain civilians and creatures. And you should do it as fast as possible, because this game has a high and sometimes unforgiving difficulty level.\n\nMost people will be discouraged by the outdated graphics and initially rough gameplay. But if you are willing to give this game a chance, you will experience a classic role-playing game with all its charms and challenges.\n\nFun fact: Wasteland’s general concept and setting became the basis for Interplay’s RPG series Fallout.\n--\n\nMy rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:\n\n-	Atmosphere\n-	Combat & Controls\n-	Details\n-	Tactical gameplay\n-	Characters\n-	Story\n\nBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading:\n\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).\n--\n\nAtmosphere: A-Rank\n\nCombat & Controls: B-Rank\n\nDetails: A-Rank\n\nTactical gameplay: S-Rank\n\n(Dummy!

There were no 3D graphics cards, or surround sound features. There was just a glorified text adventure with a few pixels of color to give you an idea where you were, what you were doing, and what that giant robotic scorpion that just destroyed your entire group 'sort of' looked like.\n\nComputer games were more tabletop than arcade - the best parts of them took place entirely in your own imagination. When Wasteland appeared, it was from another world. No wizards and swords and dragons. There were guns, goth chicks who spit on the ground, and horribly demented bad guys named after Donald Duck's nephews. The game only gave you 10 words to describe each and every one of them, but in the world of the imagination, they were tough, gritty, and completely bad ♥♥♥.\n\nTechnology and the capacity of the human mind to always make things better than they once were has left this classic behind - to the degree that it is now sustained purely by nostalgia than actual contribution. To speak of Wasteland to today's League of Legend's addicts is to listen to the haunting tails of the first appearance of the motorcar, whose alarmly breakneck speed of 10 MPH was fueled by the doomed souls of hell hosted sinners.\n\nSo I do recommend this game - but only if you approach it as an automated, self-mastered table top RPG. You will be given brief snippets of data, and your imagination will be expected to fill in the gaps. Essentially, this game is only as amazing as you are willing to make it.","September 23, 2014","true","2.3"," 29 of 48 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","29","48","0","0"

For a game that came out in 1988, this sure has some things going for it. For one, it's the godfather of the Fallout games... but don't let that fool you. First of all, this came out 9 years before Fallout 1, and it shows. Graphics quality is low, of course, and combat is the type of turn based Pokemon had in the first generation, but instead of showing you and your enemy, it just shows a profile of what you enemy supposedly looks like, just to show you something other than text. Second of all, the differences in Fallout and Wasteland are very obvious, story-wise. I'm not going to go into details here, but the apocalypse in Wasteland happened in the late 90's. The 1990's that is. So yeah, that's just some perspective.\n\nOverall... most parts of this game have not aged... well. They haven't aged badly, per se, but they have aged. Graphics quality is low, as you should expect from a game in the late 80's. The combat is, as I said above... iffy. The story, however, is great. The writing is also great. But then, comedy and satire always age relatively well.\n\nFor me, having not played this when I was younger like most people who will buy this game (people born in the 80's, or earlier I mean), and only having messed around with it in DOSbox (not a very... shall we say, fun situation), I think it's done well enough over the years for me to say that this is still a good game. The addition of the paragraphs and voice over also make this game so much easier to experience than in DOSbox, seeing how most people don't actually have copies of the original Paragraph booklet anymore.\n\nBut yeah. I'm going to say this game is still fun, almost 30 years later, and reccomend it to everyone who wants a taste of what Fallout was before it was Fallout and/or want to experience an old game with some new updates.","June 25, 2014","true","1.3"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Hopefully this saves one person from grief...\n\nThis is a fantastic game and should be played by everyone that has dedicated gaming to their PC, it is an experiance and made me buy an actual boxed copy of Wasteland. Bugs and all, it is so awesome. My tip for those who are new is to play with a guide, just to make sure you dont run into any game breaking bugs! Thanks for reading!::\n\nWasteland!\n\nI have amazing memories playing this with my dad back when I was just a child; creating our characters with our names and different skills and tools, to help us survive the Mojave and Arizona deserts. It is so great to be able to experiance it again as an adult, and actually be able to appreciate what it has done for today's day and age of gaming for western RPG's. It helped spawn an amazing post-apocalyptic genre for everyone to enjoy, one of the first (I'm pretty sure) to come out with a persistant world that changes with you and your choices (and this is all in 1988!) While I have my nostalgia fix on the review, I will be honest with it also.\n\nThis. Game. Is. ♥♥♥♥ing. Buggy.\n\nI had a game breaking bug. It really sucked to. It was underneath the sewers in Vegas. To advance the story and get a key item and location to be revealed on a map, you have to build a robot. The tables you build it on, for whatever reason, decides to not respond to my characters  actions when trying to put items on it.\n\nTwenty hours into my adventure and I'm stuck, against my own ♥♥♥♥ing will, because of a dumbass un-built robot. Underneath Vegas, in the ♥♥♥♥ing sewers. ♥♥♥♥ that. And ♥♥♥♥ this awesome game.\n\nThere are others bugs in it as well, like the engine it is built on being extremely easy to exploit enemies on. The "Super Loot Bag" trick that I refuse to use. But besides this, I can't personally say there is anything else wrong with it. People will obviously state that the graphics haven't "aged" well, and to that I would say that they are an idiot because this was made in 1988. Don't play a game, that is dated to begin with, and try and compare it to something newly released or released in that particular's game next decade.\n\nPlay this game. Bugs and all. It is a peice of gaming history. But ♥♥♥♥ you Max, the un-built robot. I'm glad those cyborgs tore your ♥♥♥♥ing body apart and used your spare parts on themselves.

Yes, back in the days of yore with the Apple 2e and the Commodore 64.\n\nThis is an old school game.

I've wondered about older, more text-based games and the aforementioned Fallout series grasped my attention and pulled it towards the post-apocalyptic RPG.\n\nWasteland, like many PC games in the 1980's, seems to warrant more of an adventure through text and its complicated gameplay, rather than its graphics. The game's graphics give you a basic idea of your bearings, but that's about it. Your crew of, at the beginning, four is identified by a single nonmoving sprite, the world moves in semi-real time--where every time you make a move an NPC or a group of them on your screen move as well. The gameplay has many tabletop elements, and uses complicated stat systems for its battles. This can be somewhat frustrating, especially when your teammates come under constant attack and you can't land a single hit. I also feel less in control, as the combat system works by having you select your attacks, then watching it occur next to a portrait of the general enemy type.\n\nThe story, though? It's interesting. To make up for the lack of graphics, Interplay managed to put acute detail into the wording of descriptions. Fall into a creek in a small town? It'll describe how you did and how you became embarrassed as kids nearby started laughing at you. Run into the wall of a building? The game will give you a full description of the building and the wall type.\n\nI feel the modernization of the game was welcome. Sure the graphics look a little plastic and odd, but they do the job overall.  I haven't gotten very far, but the outdoor desert theme provides an unsettling ambience for your rangers exploring a desolate wasteland.\n\nOn the surface, it's the slight revamping of a complicated, PC RPG which, without a manual, will leave you in a darkness you can never escape. But once you get into it, and begin to understand the wastes and its story, you might be hooked. That is, if you're an intent reader. So, if you're curious about games like Fallout, take a look at this, afterall, FO is Wasteland's spiritual successor.","April 9, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","5"

Your melee and fisty specialists can waste a round switching to fists if it turns out that you encountered Bambi instead of Vanadium Vultures.\n\n#2) Always hide and rest up, even if you are *only* at 90% health - yes, it makes a difference.\n\n#3) Try to wander around and find simple things to do before going into a known encounter.\n\nI'm giving thumbs up because there are a few fun things to do, like the PROTON AXE! But mostly because I played the game long enough to be hypnotized by it. I can't tell you how many times I reloaded saves because I died in the DOS original.","April 12, 2015","true","13.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well I did play games back when C64 was the hype. Even before that when pong was the best thing there was. Done some text games as well and did enjoy them back when they were the best thing there was.\nToday games this old just don't appeal to me anymore. If I wanna use only my imagination for visuals I read a book. Fallout 1 barely gets over that bar of old games I bare to play.\n\nDo I recommend or not? Well if you never played games like these you should give it a go. Just to see how far games have evolved. Specially if you're of the younger gamer generation for whom really old gaming is Playstation 2 or even PS1. Definitely try it. This game is brilliant piece of gaming history after all. :)\nIf you are like me who was a kid back when this game was new and played games then.

I've wondered about older, more text-based games and the aforementioned Fallout series grasped my attention and pulled it towards the post-apocalyptic RPG.\n\nWasteland, like many PC games in the 1980's, seems to warrant more of an adventure through text and its complicated gameplay, rather than its graphics. The game's graphics give you a basic idea of your bearings, but that's about it. Your crew of, at the beginning, four is identified by a single nonmoving sprite, the world moves in semi-real time--where every time you make a move an NPC or a group of them on your screen move as well. The gameplay has many tabletop elements, and uses complicated stat systems for its battles. This can be somewhat frustrating, especially when your teammates come under constant attack and you can't land a single hit. I also feel less in control, as the combat system works by having you select your attacks, then watching it occur next to a portrait of the general enemy type.\n\nThe story, though? It's interesting. To make up for the lack of graphics, Interplay managed to put acute detail into the wording of descriptions. Fall into a creek in a small town? It'll describe how you did and how you became embarrassed as kids nearby started laughing at you. Run into the wall of a building? The game will give you a full description of the building and the wall type.\n\nI feel the modernization of the game was welcome. Sure the graphics look a little plastic and odd, but they do the job overall.  I haven't gotten very far, but the outdoor desert theme provides an unsettling ambience for your rangers exploring a desolate wasteland.\n\nOn the surface, it's the slight revamping of a complicated, PC RPG which, without a manual, will leave you in a darkness you can never escape. But once you get into it, and begin to understand the wastes and its story, you might be hooked. That is, if you're an intent reader. So, if you're curious about games like Fallout, take a look at this, afterall, FO is Wasteland's spiritual successor.","April 9, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","5"

This doesnt mean that it is bad, but ends in many clueless approaches into the game and frustrational situations. I kinda like the game itself, many aspects of it, but wouldnt recommend it to other people.\n\nThe hud is very awful, the 4 given characters are very awfully skilled and there is no mission briefing or something like that so you start infront of the HQ. Anyways you should just create your own party, but the problem is that you wether not know how to use many of the skills, or when you can use them(and how useful they are) Example: there is an abillity called combat shooting, that, you probably think lets you get better with all weapons in general at battles? Well no, that one has no porpuse at all. Really annoying is that many abillitys just got like 1-2 uses in the whole game.Some things i like are stuff like, either breaking doors with strength, or lockpicking it with the skill. The character creating is damn annoying because you have to roll all your stats in one go, problem is that if you want to do an brute like person, that has much strength and life. But they random all of the stats at the same time, so it could take much time to get in both stats much points.\n\nThe price itself for a port like this is well, okay. But the only part i really hate about this game is that it autosaves every time you enter / leave a town/place and then you end up with low life infront of an enemy after loading a game. The game works on my pc(windows 7) without any problems.Minimizing the game then coming back doesnt really work for me. There are many people complaining about ingame bugs, but i didnt encounter any of them yet. Also the music added is fantastic, and gives you an awesome atmosphere.\n\nIt is an experementing game, quite unique and fun to look into, but playing trough is a little torture , either you trail and error and waste tons of hours(not much fun) or looking into the wiki to know what skill actually do etc(also after some time not very fun). After many approaches iunderstood most of the basic features and then i could actually do something proper, even tough i couldnt make it(wasnt patient enough) without a walktrough or atleast help at some areas.\n\nIf you can oversee that and like to have an open world that lets you do what you want, but still have somewhat a story, the game is yours. Otherwise its a waste of money.(sorry for the pun). For me it was a fun game, and also good to see how wasteland 2 changed, since it scrapped many of the experementing parts(like having skills like mining, simming or climbing etc), but replaced them with very good and mostly balanced elements.\n\nWith the (gamebreaking) bugs and unbalanced gameplay i would give it a 5/10 since the story, freedom and atmosphere(with the added sountrack) made the game really unqiue.","January 3","false","29.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I got it for free with Wasteland 2, and as a fan of Fallout 2 I could still enjoy gameplay, combat, locations, and all the stuff the game had to offer. The RPG system was cool, and the character creation gives a cool style that almost has this game revolve around ironman rather than spamming load-save. Locations weren't polished, but had effort and style that was really nice. All of that was great, and I can't insult anything the game was *intended* to be. Now, the game-breaker here is the bug problem this game has. The most notable one, one I dealt with >:(, is that the game autosaves when you buy stuff, and if you don't save afterward you can't trade with the merchant anymore. Now, this isn't a problem early-game, but when you get to Quartz and Needles your entire gamesave is screwed because you can't trade and get really important items. Along with this, you have buggy scripted events that happen that also screw up a lot of things, perks and skills not working, and so many other things that just make it unplayable. Kind of frustrating having to repeat the game because of poorly made mechanics and bugs, and it happens a *lot*. If you can find a guide to fix all that, be my guest and get it, but otherwise don't get it.","October 3, 2015","false","9.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","2"

If that means anything to you at all, then you have no need for this review.  For everyone else...\n\nWasteland is a classic that provided the foundation for not only the Fallout series, but for more open-ended, realistic gameplay.  However, the graphics are terrible: a block man on a map, pictures of robots, useless UI flair.  The sound is terrible: a small bit of music, nothing for everything else.  Controls are terrible: tons of menus, a few hotkeys, not enough macros. The gameplay is terrible: literally useless skills, little reason not to kill everyone, 30 matches takes as much space as 30 assault rifles.\n\nWasteland is a great game for anyone with the nostalgia or appreciation.  However, the latter is lacking among most, so the game cannot be recommended.\n\n9/10","July 24, 2014","false","9.0"," 11 of 52 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","11","52","0","0"

Sure, I can see that, but fallout is a type of game that takes a genre and defines it. This game just happened to be first. Sometimes being first to the genre doesn't mean you're the best...\n\nIn 2014, however this game is literally a joke.
