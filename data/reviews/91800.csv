You won’t find anything groundbreaking in it or much innovation at all, but it is a fun game.  If you enjoy casual puzzle-platformers, and you want a new experience, then you will probably enjoy Cloning Clyde.\n\nIt’s a simple game, with the main system to solving levels revolving around the 2 basic mechanics: splicing your DNA with animals to gain abilities (flight, underwater breathing, better jumping, etc.); and creating clones of yourself which you can then take control of.  The puzzles are simple, and the platforming is easy.  It is a very casual game.\n\nEach level has some collectibles and a par-time to beat; they are very generous and easy to achieve.  It won’t take very long to earn 100% completion in the game, and after that there isn’t really much replay value.\n\nThe graphics are mediocre, and there is not really a story or anything.  However, the controls were good for me with a controller, and there were no frustrating parts.  I experienced no glitches/crashing.\n\nHaving said all that, I enjoyed my playthrough of Cloning Clyde.  It is certainly far from the best game in the genre, but I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys casual, side-scrolling puzzle-platformers and is looking for some novelty.  It is a short game, though; but if you get it for a good price, it is worth the playthrough.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","January 29, 2015","true","4.9"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","37","43","0","0"

I played the crap out of the demo on Xbox 360 (came pre-installed) but never bought it for that system. Years later and it's on a steam summer sale and I say "to hell with it, buy the damn game" and have not regretted it since. I may not get all the clones back, or all the secret action figures, or play on anything harder than easy mode, but I still love the game.

The puzzles themselves vary in difficulty and all revolve around your ability to clone yourself and use your clones to manipulate certain puzzles on the gamefield.  My only   minor gripe about the game is the fairly low resolution graphics which on a widescreen monitor when stretched to fullscreen result in a lot of jagged edges on the screen.  The music is sparse and limited to flourishes and the intro screen, but I would still recommend this game to puzzle lovers who want a little bit of arcade action.  Platform arcade enthusiasts though may find the actual twitch aspect of the game lacking, and the enemies are really only their to delay the completing of the puzzles rather than representing a serious threat.  All in all it's a competent game though, and worth recommending to most Steam gamers.","May 31, 2012","true","0.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I didn't regret picking this up durning DailyDeal and now after finishing it, I can say that it is even worth it's full price :)\nControls are responsive and get the job well done.

Unfortunately, however, there are no redeeming qualities to make up for this. There are a decent amount of game mechanics and levels to keep the total playtime up to 6 hours. The levels however are in no way challenging.\n\nVisuals: It's pretty disappointing. It looks very unfinished.\n\nAudio: It's not the worst audiowise. I can say that the sound effects match the disproportionate cartoon-like theme that they were aiming for. The soundtrack would get  repetitive as the amount of songs they had didn't match the playtime it took to beat the game.\n\nReplayability*: There is none. I have no desire to go back and play the game. All the levels are the exact same and often times the "perfection" mechanics (collecting all of the X) can usually be done on the first run through.\n\n*This varies A LOT from person to person, so only rely on this category from me if you've agreed with my other reviews' replayability sections.","November 25, 2013","false","5.6"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

It's a platformer puzzler where you navigate your way through well-designed levels to find the exit, with the catch that to get past certain obstacles you will need to find or make clones of yourself, or mutate into different forms (bomb, frog, chicken, monkey etc.).\n\nOnce you have clones you can switch to any clone anywhere else on the level at any time.  There is very little combat or chance to fail, with just a few robots on each level you must destroy to open the exit.  You're not timed, but there is a par time on each course you can try to beat.  You also have the option of saving all your clones by exiting them through vents before you exit the level using your last one, and there are several collectibles to find on each level.  All of this is optional and tied to some easy achievements.\n\nDozens of fun levels, not frustrating at all and plays great with a gamepad.  A little too easy, though.","December 2, 2011","true","6.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
