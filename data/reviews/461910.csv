This style of gameplay isn't as common as other types of games within the Mobile market, but it is present.\n\nThat's about as much good I can say, however. There's definitely many more bads to goods to this Steam App:\n\nWhen I played the game, the game felt a bit laggy while controlling my characters or navigating the menu. I don't know if it's my OS that caused this, but it very quickly got irritating.\n\nThe UI doesn't feel modified for a PC. Often, I have difficulty selecting the unit that I want to move, which doesn't help considering the already-present lag. When I try to click a unit above another, I'll end up selecting THAT unit instead. There's also grammar and font issues, as well, which is something one SHOULD fix when porting a game from the Mobile market.\n\nFinally, when I tried closing the window with Alt+F4 or the corner button, it instead kept bringing me to the Gem Purchase menu. I get that the game is free-to-play, but this seems like a very underhanded move, especially when all I wanted to do was close the game. This part here was the nail in the coffin towards my feelings about this game; it felt less like a legitimate attempt at a good game and more like an attempt to desperately harvest money from players.","May 6","false","1.2"," 119 of 138 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","119","138","2","1"

The game is simple enough to pick up, just press "Go". All you need to do is setup an army evolve and fuse them, place them in a formation on a 3x5 grid, then press "Go" the whole way.  Archers in the back, melee in the front. This game is meant for the mobile community with the incessant pleading to buy beginner's packs. There is a very strong Pay To Win Mechanism, refer to CONS for more details. It's like one of your Facebook games, don't forget to add your friends. It's not supposed to be on Steam.\n\nPROS\n1. 8 Chapters\nThey put in the effort to make 8 stages.\n\n2. Simple to Learn\nJust press "Go"\n\n3. Collecting Sets of Creatures\nEasy enough to do. These things come automatically as you progress in the game.\n\n4. Artwork\nAll the monsters look good even though there is repetitive artwork. E.g. Wolf, big Wolf, bigger Wolf. Blue Frog, Red Frog, Black Frog.\n\n5. Castle\nThe castle is pretty good, you get to build stuff, though it's like Farmville upgrading. You need to farm Wood, Stone and Magic Orbs to upgrade every single building in the Castle.\n\nCONS\n1. Repetitive and Boring Mechanic\nThe game isn't just Press Go as you can move units around mid battle, heal, cast spells, items and add more summons. However, casting spells, reviving and items require cash shop items that totally ruin the experience. E.g. Thor's Hammer Deal 900 damage to all enemies is a cash shop item.\n\n2. Paywall\nYou need to pay to get more meat for more energy to play the game. There's a $2.99 Beginner's Pack for a Tier 5 Elite Dragon and a Tier 4 Elite Lion, 500,000 gold, 250 gems, 5 Thor Hammers and 5 Ruby Stones. This just sets  a precedent for more Pay-To-Win\n\n3. Not All Creatures Can Evolve\nSome creatures like the slug can't evolve.\n\n4. Pay To Win List\na. $99.99 for 7500 gems\nb. VIP Powers. VIP Level 25. Buy 2,500,000 Gems (They call it Eternal Overlord)\n+25% Gems for Bank Purchases\n+500,000,000 Gold\n+1200 Food and 170 Chili\n+2000 Time Turners\n+15 Golden Keys\n\n5. Time Turners\nUsed for Auto Mode on stages. They actually sell you things for automating pressing "Go". 4 Gems for 1 Time Turner.\n\n6. Fast Forward Button\nThere isn't a need to play the game. Just press Fast Forward and it's all over.\n\n7. You need to be Rank 5 for Multiplayer Combat\nEverything from Rank 1 to 4 is just tutorial.","May 7","false","1.4"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","0"

In fact it's even fairly enjoyable for the first couple hours of gameplay.\n\nProgression's smooth, there's a good balance between whatever army you can build (for free) and the campaign difficulty, RNGesus' a ♥♥♥♥♥ but that's something we're all used to... BUT once you get past a certain point it gets more and more difficult to advance without spending money or mindlessly grinding like hell hoping for some good RNG procs.\n\nPVP gets totally unbalanced quickly since buyers gets in the way (A single rank 5 unit which is part of the beginner's package, NOT maxed out, can take down your whole army nearly singlehandedly, warlord included, even though you have 3 times your opponent's level / army value... seriously?) which prevent's you from building up winning streaks, which prevents you from farming energy, a necessery component to upgrade your army / items efficiency. In other words, you NEED it, but you CAN'T get it if you don't pay.\n\nSame goes for evolving your troops; grinding is all well and good as an alternative for smoking your credit card, but if you can't beat the level in which you can get the units you need and not some useless or sub-component grunt, what's the point?\n\nThose are the reasons why I can't recommend this game. If you aim to waste a dozen or so hours it's fine, but don't expect to progress any further without spending something (not necessarily hundreds of bucks, but at least some).","May 13","false","71.8"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","24","37","0","4"

You have played this game before even if you haven't played it under this specific name. You know the type, collect low ranked monsters and merge them together to create higher ranked monsters then merge even more of those but watch that you don't run out of 'stamina', which is named food in this game, for some reason.\n\nA google search showed their used to be cheat engine codes to bypass that draconian measure but all I could find were viruses which is kind of a shame really, if they got rid of the stamina system you would still have a boring time, but it would be less boring as you grind stage one ad infinity. Well, you would if you could since every time you do the same stage, the rewards diminish which strikes me as odd. The rewards are not stellar anyway and its in your best interests to keep moving forwards but then this isn't a game in the traditional sense anyway.\n\nThe cash shop bombards you frequently as you try to play and try as I might to ignore it, it just adds more clicks to get things done since you need to shove the cash shop out of your face every waking moment. So since its always around why don't we take a look at whats for sale shall we?\n\nYou can buy stamina, because of course you can. You can also buy lottery tickets for a chance to get cool monsters. You can buy temporary boost items for PvE/PvP\n\nThat's it. Yup, the shop that they shove so hard in your face, doesn't even contain all that much anyway and you know something else? It isn't because they wanted the game to be 'fair' or anything like that, its because the game i that shallow that they don't have anything much to sell you. So even if you wanted to spend money on the game their isn't much point.\n\nFinally PvP...Doesn't exist. Its the old, you play against a AI controlled 'player team' and if you caught it earlier, you can use items during it but they can't, since they are AI controlled. Player vs AI is NOT Player vs Player but steam (and other such app stores) allow these games to market themselves as such but if you were expecting to lord over peasents then I am afraid this game isn't for you.\n\nIts not for anyone really unless you enjoy CCG, which I do. Sure it doesn't say its a CCG but lets be honest, collecting monsters, merging them, how mny F2P games use this forumla? Most of them are card games and regardless of how this one presents itself its basically a card game despite what it says on the store page.\n\nAs far as a CCG goes, they are all the same for their is only 1 CCG in the known universe with every other type being  derivative off it.

So, playing in general.\n\nThe game clearly gives you a lot of cool things for a good first impression and then says "Okay, throw money at me now. Please." Lots of microtransactions for literally everything, and the game constantly reminds you of that. They're not straight up required, but the game would be a lot more enjoyable if you did just because of the grinding in general.\n\nThere's clearly a bunch of content with evolutions for your characters which is really nice and a thing to look forward to, but the grinding required to get the component characters to that level (Note: You would have to get those component characters first), as well as getting your account to the required level, is a big turn off. Or it was for me, at least.\n\nArt style is that art style you would normally expect from a browser game. It's not horrible, but it's not beautiful nor distinctive.\n\nGameplay is just click a thing and ocassionally move your characters in an attemp of strategizing since different characters in your formation, as well as enemy units, all have different stats and passive effects. I'm sure that last part gets a lot more complex eventually, but the gameplay is still the game. Click a button to move ahead and kill dudes. I don't have an issue with it, but that's just how it is.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a fun game to play if you're bored and don't feel like doing anything, but have in mind that it requires time and commitment in order to reach most things that you want, which is not the kind of game I'm looking for when I look for a game to play when I'm bored and not feeling like doing anything.\n\nBut again, that's just me. If you like playing browser games and spending a lot of time and effort (Or money, even) then you should try this.","June 4","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've played a lot of MMOs in my time and two of the most fun aspects for me in MMOs were crafting and PVP. This game sort of combines those two elements. You gather monster to essentially crafter bigger and stronger monster and you put your creations up against other players creations and see who wins. I've put a total of $25 dollars into the game and I have access to everything and there is plenty to do in game for a couple hours a day if you dont want to buy more energy.\n\nIt is grindy, but I love when I grind a zone looking for that rare elite monster and it finally drops. There is no better feeling. There is no instant gratification in this game, and to me that is part of what makes it fun.\n\nThe developers are always around in the discussion area and on other forums for the game.\n\nThere was a recent PVP tournament that had a few bugs and players were awarded $30 worth of cash shop gems. I love that type of customer care. They know they messed up and they tried to fix the problems quickly and awarded the players who had to deal with the bugs.\n\nIf you like crafting , pvp, and dont mind a little grind.

You have in-game currency and premium currency that allows you to buy a chest (like CS: GO) that have a chance to drop greater monsters.\n\nThis game is based on team composition that you need to build a team with different type of roles and monsters, each one with their strength's and weakness's. Early game you receive few rare monsters to help you with your progress, but later on it's basically grinding for them or lucky RNG with the chests.\n\nThis also includes a VIP System that gives you an advantage, not noticeable at the begging, but it will be a huge gap between a VIP and a Non-VIP player the longer you play the game. Nothing is really Pay 2 Win, except the part that you can buy the chest but still, that's a random chance to get good stuff. What you can do with the premium currency is to advance your progress faster.\n\nIs you are in to these type of games, go ahead and try it, probabilly you will enjoy like my self.","June 5","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is not a time waister. It is a waist of time.\nDevs do care care about cheaters, but not here (blame the facebook and mobile version).\nSince the game is well polished from the start (like every f2p game), things get horrible as you move on.\nYou will meet paywall after paywall after paywall.\nWait 3 hours here and after that you wait another 7h there.\nAnd while you are waiting you could spent some of your money to at least get a shot a the top notch.\nThe game has two energy bars... Food (or so) for PvE, which feels fine with a recharge amount of 3 mins.\nAnd one for PvP. It refills after 30 minutes. 30!\nAnd you only got five of them.\nTo use them in your guild wars, your daily PVP rank AND your tournament progress.\n\nOverall the game is not bad. Not at all.\nBut is never meant to be on Steam.\nIt is a Facebook game, play it there.\n\nForge of Gods is another mobile game, which made it to Steam.\nCollector game, with a nice little strategic gameplay, but don't expect to much from "RPG" in the title.\nYou collect creatures and evolve them. Not a real RPG, like equiping items and puting points into stuff like strenght or so.\n\nBut what so ever great time waster.\nAnd NO... you don't need money to have success in the game. No pay walls, no unbeatable-because-money stuff.\nBut... it has the energy system, and of course you can fill up the bars (yeah, game has two bars - one for PVE and one for PVP) by spending money.\n\nLet's list it up\n\nPros:\n\n- accessive gameplay\n- addictive collection system\n- graphics are okay. It is a mobile strategy port, what you expect!?\n- PVP including guild wars\n- every level comes in three difficulties, so you got something to do\n- It is for free\n\nCons:\n\n- Energy system, it fit the overall design of the game, but.. we are on Steam\n- No chat function. You got a message board in your guild, but thats all\n- ♥♥♥♥ing friend codes. The whole ComHub is filled up with those codes + no function to add your Steam friends.\nYou just got those damn codes\n- I just can speak for the german localisation. This is so bad, I have to play the game in english.\nIt seems to be translated with the Google translator. Biggest problem is, that you have to play the tutorial before you can switch the language\n\n\nOverall:\n7.5/10 for a mobile game\n\nGive it a try, it is addictive, it is for free.\n\nUpdate (28th of May):\nWith the latest update, the devs finally made it to Steam, adding an ingame- chat.\nYou can't choose between you guild, or friends or whatsoever, just puts you into the generall, let's call it 'world'- chat, with a Steam layover and stuff.\nBut hey... Devs are very, very close to the community (the god sent man, who has to take the blame for everything, even added me to his friend list) and they are new to Steam, but they are working on the game with the community.. Extra plus here.\n\nAll little deeper now into the game... we have to add new pros and cons...\n\nPros:\n- Guild Ranking\nAs we are drawing to sunday midnight, this stuff really is getting intense. One more rank for weekly guild ranking, or not. IF you are in an active guild, with good communications, the game really starts to kick off. You are even searching your friend list for some guy to kick off, just to add one of your guild fellowships. Depends on your guild. I guess.\n\n- Creature Leveling\nAs you are on the never search to put more power into your army, you will find yourself backpacking. In a good way. So you wanna level up your Tier 4 monster, you go back to capure a level 2 monster. And again. And two more, because you will need a copy of this tier to level up and so on, with an extra monster of a weird chosen point.\nYou are on a quest for your own. I like that. A lalalalot.\n\n- Deeper Tactical Gameplay\nAfter I switched my Xenia- lika useless amazon.. amazone... the ♥♥♥♥♥ with a bow and red hair warlord (this is your big boy, and you can switch it at any time with no regrets) to big bad orge, with bad teeth and a big belly and chance for any beast creature to double attack with a 30% within his range... You start to think about your... loadout.. army. PVP is getting harder with your progression... and here is the big contra...\n\n- Trails\n.. can only competed with a special troop. Only beast or demons within it. Or just females (yay, feminism) for a special remark. It adds varity into your standart set up.\n\nCons:\n\n- Exploiters\nThey are already here. They are in every game (The Division), they use bugs and ♥♥♥♥ and they aren't even cheating. Biggest problem here is, the devs are working for multiple platforms and their support is not mainly focused on Steam, even if they are dead serious about those persons.\n\n- Progression\nI am now at lvl 19 (with a total of 300), things are getting hard.\nIf you do not wanna pay... grind. And that is not good. Never.\n\n----\n\nOverall... still a thumbs up.","May 23","false","30.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love quests!\n> I like it that you can check what the enemies stats are while in a battle\n> There are multiple characters to pick at the beginning, giving variety to the play styles\n\nCons-\n>  The intro video doesn't tell you ANYTHING interesting about the game.\n> I thought the quests would be decent, but they're REALLY not.\n> The music might as well be wake me up inside ear ♥♥♥♥\n> The music is muffled, making it very unconfortable to play levels slowly\n> The tutoriel kinda ends quickly and leaves you in the dark for a while, giving you blinds tips every few minutes,\n> Ok ok ok, wtf is up with spiders, like seriously its difficult to get through the third/fourth level with them against you\n> Your character/any of your people can be countered EASILY\n> 'Collected' souls seem to be able to flee, how are they collected if they're going to flee?\n\nBut the thing that bugged me the most, was not the music, not the ads begging for you to spend some of your money (don't), but the thing that made me stop playing the game was the tutoriel.\nThe tutoriel might aswell just give you the first level, show you where you can see our army  outside of battle and then leave. It COMPLETELY defeats the objective of a tutoriel. Also, by the time you get to the end of the fourth level, all of your army members get either one shot by the mobs at the first wave, or deal NO damage what so ever, let alone the giant just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you like there's no tomorrow.\n\nNow, like I said it's a free game, so you cant say it's a waste of money, however it was a waste of my time, just clicking the 'go' button about 1000 times, please if you are considering to atleast try this game out you need to be calm at the beginning otherwise you won't get anyway (without buying anything with  real money)\n\n~I hope this review helped you (if you actually read it)","May 10","false","0.5"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","3"

This is one of the WORST games I've ever had the displeasure of wasting 10 minutes of my life on(even more when you count the time it's taking to write this)\n\nLet's start of with the gameplay...there is none. Don't believe me? Try it,you press one button "GO!" that's it let me explain.\n\nSo the game works like this,you have a squad of heroes that you move to the right of a grid based map by pressing the go button and they instantly attack enemies for you! you do nothing but watch,the most input you can make is dropping pick ups on them or selecting a main target,which doesn't seem to matter because they still attack anything in their path willy nilly.\n\nNow you're maybe saying "HEY! that's not that bad you mean like an RTS right?"\n...nope..there's no thought process at all it just happens wether you want it or not it's not turn based you litterly can just spam the "go!" button and win in like 2 seconds it just happens and you get overly rewarded for it too.\n\nYou also can earn heroes and chests on the grid simply by clicking them and there doesn't seem to be a limit on what you pick up,I would have liked "well here's three heroes but you can only pick 1." Actually when I think about it doesn't even matter then too since,oh I don't know,THERE IS NO STATS just classes with different skins this is one of the most dumb downed piece of feces I've ever put on my pc.\n\nAnd let's not forget the most important part...IT'S....BROKEN.\nThat's right the display doesn't even work right it constantly rips and tears with the map skipping over it self and your steam notifications being forever burned onto the screen when they apear.\n\nI would not touch this game with a ten foot pole and I suggest you do the same.","May 28","false","0.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","4","11","2","1"

While I appreciate their gesture of kindness, the game, sadly, is lackluster. The story doesn't give you much reason to continue playing and attempts to hook the player by stating something along the lines of "if you get far enough, we'll tell you what's going on" but that didn't interest me. The gameplay consists of pressing a button to send your troops forward a square, or pressing the same button to attack. You can drag and drop your troops into different positions to attack enemies and you can have your troops target one specific enemy. But the problem I faced with this was that it wasn't fun for me.  Perhaps it gets better later, but after 40 minutes of playing, I just couldn't care less about advancing the plot or leveling up. Another problem I found is that the game advertises payment options frequently. I can appreciate a developer needing to continue to eat and provide for their family, however to the average person, advertisements are annoying. Now, to give the game credit, payment is not necessary to have decent troops. Finally, the last problems I encountered. Firstly: When encountering a new enemy, a description will flash about the enemy's stats. However, when closing this description, part of the screen will glitch out. Secondly: There doesn't appear to be a way to close the game without alt+tabbing or turning fullscreen off and closing out of the program that way. Perhaps I simply missed it, and if so, my apologies, however most games have an option to shut down the game inside of the game itself usually located in one of the top corners or in a menu in one of these corners.","May 29","false","0.7"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","1"

The best part is that you can buy any almost any microtransaction or pack with in-game currency and it's fair priced. It's a game built on loot addiction, so much so that early in the game it offers the option to auto-play every fight stage. As expected, you start kicking butt, taking lots of units for your army, upgrading, smooth stuff, and then it gets muddy, slow, grindy, very grindy. And that's okay. You can buy stuff with real money, or devise a strategy to find the best early stage with high amount of loot and keep grinding. It can be fun, if you like browser games like Candy Crush Saga mixed with kinda Heroes of Might & Magic type of gameplay, but neither production value. It's okay looking, the drawings are nice, don't expect animations.\nHere's where I got with the game: you kinda have to upgrade your army, even after you max level every unit, that's where the game drags. To get more units, you need to capture them, and some of the units flee, unless you pay with gems (in-game currency). Everything has to be paid with gems to progress, otherwise just wait and wait you will. So in trying to evolve one of my units, I had to get eggs. Just damn dragon eggs or something like that. But here's the fun part: the eggs fled. How the hell does an egg flee?

As if all ftp games are bad by default. It's not like this. I've played a lot of ftp games without paying anything and enjoyed a lot of them.\n\nThis game is one of those that I enjoyed. I played it on Kongregate and got to level 40 before I got bored with it.\n\nAbout the game: you make a team of different units with a lot of passive skills and clear dungeons in turn-based combat where you press forward button and see your team moving one step forward (unless they are blocked) and turn actions resolve - archers shoot, healers heal, some abilities trigger, some units die, etc. You can change formation of your units in a team, you can use some one-time boosts, you can order everyone to focus on one enemy. When enemy units die they sometimes drop souls that you can capture and have them join your team. Outside the battle you can evolve units by combining several lower tier ones into higher tier ones. Depending on certain circumstances (time, level, elite status) units gain a certain bonus to their stats after evolving. Later in the game you can also upgrade your castle that gives minor boosts to units/skills/evolution and provides some extra daily income.\n\nThere are several types of stages that are available in the game: campaign stages (each node has 3 difficulties and has a certain setup of enemies so you can farm them for units that you need), daily challenges (each map requires a certain team composition and provides special rewards), weekly portals (they have certain enemies required for higher tier evolutions and access to them changes depending on the day of the week), pvp (these are just battles against other player's teams).\n\nSpecial currency: main currency that you buy for real money can be easily acquired while playing the game. You gain small amounts for finishing each campaign mission for the first time, you gain small amount from the mine in your castle, you gain some for daily logins and most important source - you gain some for finishing several daily missions. You will need that currency mostly to unlock extra slots for your army, but even default amount of slots (50) is enough to keep a good amount of captured units if you don't suffer from "I must keep them all!".\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn (but rather intricate due to a lot of passive skills) turn-based battle system\n2. Interesting evolution system\n3. Easy access to special currency\n4. Interesting process of farming/grinding for units to evolve if you enjoy such things\n5. You can continue to max unit stats after evolving the unit by doing daily challenges for special units that boost them slightly\n\nCons:\n1. Energy (Food) system that I personally hate in such games (though it's is not very restricting in this game)\n2. PVP had a lot of enemy teams that were really strong and you could not understand it before choosing to attack them (this may have changed after I stopped playing the game)\n3. Farming/grinding for units can become rather boring after a while because chances to get exactly what you want (a certain type of unit with an elite status) and then to be able to capture it were really low (this may have changed too after I stopped playing the game). I remember there was an item that allowed to breeze through the level by auto-advancing and giving a huge boost to attack power. Even with that item, that allowed to clear a map in less than a minute, it took a lot of time to farm for certain types of units.\n\nAnyway the game was really good and enjoyable for a while, so I recommend trying it.\n\nForgot to mention: on Kongregate this game has 3.8/5 rating with almost 2m players (it's amount of players who tried the game, not the current amount of players I believe).","May 7","true","0.2"," 14 of 35 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","14","35","2","6"
