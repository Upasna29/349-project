"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/12500/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","291 products in account","Puzzle Quest: Challenge Of The Warlords is an addicting puzzle game with an added roleplaying element. The title was developed by Infinite Interactive and published by Namco Networks America. Anyone who has played Tetris, Bejewelled or any similiar game will be quite familiar with the puzzle portion of this fantastic title but for me, as a heavy R.P.G. fan, it was this part of the game that really makes it stand apart from the others in the genre.\n\nAs in the start of a typical roleplaying game you select your character and class before the terrific story sends you traveling across a vast fantasy world in search of quests, battles and loot. I found the story to be extremely compelling and at times humorous. It definitely keeps your attention and makes you want to wander about and converse with any person or beast that would cross your path. The combat, of course, takes place in puzzle format and tasks you with matching pairs of colored gems, skulls and other items while casting spells as well as a variety of other attacks and moves against your opponent. As you battle you earn experience points which you can spend upgrading your skills as well as accquiring gold and loot with which you can better outfit your character. You also have the option to capture opponents and hold them in your dungeon. You can then learn new spells and combat tactics from your prisoners as well as use the captured beasts as mounts as you traverse the world.\n\nThe game is presented very well with a combination of fantastic hand drawn manga-like art for the cut scenes as well as an old school top down "Legend Of Zelda" like world map. Shockingly one of the best parts of the game in my opinion is the music. I can't stress how great the soundtrack is in this title as it expertly captures the fantasy theme of the game. I fell in love with it after just a few days of playing the title. The sound effects during the puzzle battles are terrific as well. You never get tired of hearing the explosions, coin drops and other tell-tale effects when you successfully connect a line of gems and cause a cascade that devastates your opponent bringing them to their knees in defeat...absolutely priceless. I never thought I would be a fan of puzzle games but the Puzzle Quest series has, no pun intended, cast a spell on me. Highly recommended! I think I like this one better than Puzzle Quest 2 which I adore.","September 7, 2014","true","107.6"," 75 of 80 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","75","80","0","11"

This is an RPG after all, albeit a linear one - with quite a lot of sidequests and the main quest is lengthy, my game play time at the moment is pretty much an indicator of a single playthrough, which was ~36 hours.\n\nSo what's the quirk of this game? The battle system. The battle system is based on Bejeweled, and as you match pieces, you get mana, gold, exp or deal direct damage. With mana, you can cast spells. And if you put 4 in a row or stun the enemy or the like, you can get extra turns and it can get quite crazy if you have a Frozen Rod, have 1% chance of stun for each of your blue mana (so with 41 blue mana you have 41% chance of stun on every instance of dealing damage), and some other stuff. As you can tell, there are items that manipulate the gameplay on both your side and the enemy's.\n\nYou can also capture monsters and use them as a mount (and gain an extra stat based on their level and get an extra skill to use in combat), or you can research their spells. You can also craft your own items with runes you can collect. Each of these uses a system that is a variation on the base battle system.\n\nVERDICT: If you like strategic gameplay and you're oddly addicted to Match-3 puzzle games, and enjoy a decent (even if not the most unique nor the most complicated) story, and decent music, then this is definitely a good game. It really depends on whether you enjoy the combat or not: because you'll do a LOT of it in this game. But hey, I enjoyed it.","November 9, 2014","true","35.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

I could be mistaken, but I believe this is the game that was the catalyst to the creation of so many puzzle-rpg hybrid games.\n\nIt does a great job in tuning out the monotony of a Bejewled game by adding in rpg elements. Each gem color signifies mana, which are used to cast skills, which you learn as your character gains levels and completes side-quest puzzles. Each match is a battle against an enemy that you encounter on your quest. Your character traverses a map that is similar to the world map in Final Fantasy Tactics. Certain locations on the map can be captured as your territory, and then upgraded to provide you with gold revenue and other benefits. Items can also be found and bought for your character to grant additional perks.\n\nTo compare this to other bejeweled games, such as: Puzzle Quest 2, Legend of Fae, Bejeweled 3, Marvel Puzzle Quest...\nI enjoyed this game the most.","January 14, 2014","true","0.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","1"

It was something new and fresh in the field of "match 3 gems" games. It had story, fantasy background, skills, spells. And then it got even overwhelming. Too many stuff to know, handle. Too many side quests, too many spells, skills, items, town management, mounts, followers, etc. Yeah, you didn't have to do all, but if you wanted to be good and fight even more powerful foes, you had to improve on all fields. So i've got tired and didn't want to launch it again. Even more annoying thing was, that while traveling through a huge map of a world you didn't only had to confront creatures tied to the quests, but on those paths between towns and towers there were same creatures and they were constantly randomly respawning. So if you wanted to go across the map to solve some quest, you had to fight them over and over again and then on your way back.. It became boring and frustrating very fast.\n\nBut after completing Gyromancer and not liking it much i've decided to give this another try and finish a story. So i did. Though the last boss was haaaard. And i had to go to the map and grind for more experience, doing every side quest i could and improving skills, getting better items, etc. And finally i've beat him!\n\nThe story was fine. Mechanics are interesting. So i give it a Yes, but i won't be getting back to it, and i hear that sequel is even more boredom and grinding without a decent story, so i'll probably pass.","March 15, 2015","true","27.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/12500/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","It's basically Bejeweled with RPG elements thrown in.  Every colored set of gems is for a different element, and you have to spend these element points to cast spells to damage the enemy.  Otherwise you can match 3 skulls and damage the enemy directly.\n\nWinning a combat round gives you experience towards your next level which in turn grants you access to new spells, and gives you some skill points to distribute towards making certain elements more powerful, or to give you an overall boost in the game.  You also have equipment that adds certain effects such as reducing the amount of damage you take, increasing the damage you can do, or even reducing a certain element from your enemy when you fulfill certain conditions.\n\nIn a way the game reminds me a lot of "Gyromancer" except you do the matches directly instead of doing the "bejeweled twist" style matches.  The only thing not "bejeweled" about this game is that there are no special exploding gems created for doing complex matches.   You do get a free turn if you match 4 in a row, and if you match 5 in a row you get a free turn + a wildcard piece added to the board.\n\nThere's also some gold pieces to match for more money, and "purple stars" for experience. In addition, certain stats increase the likelihood of these non-element matches giving you a free turn, so sometimes it's worth giving it a shot even if you'd rather be collecting the elemental pieces (red, green, blue, and yellow).\n\nThe music is decent, the graphics are kinda flat but it does the job, and the story is.... there.  I mean, so far it hasn't added that much extra to the game but it's not cheezy either. If you're a fan of Bejeweled and puzzle games it's worth checking out.  If you're dying for some real action or deep strategy, you should probably look elsewhere though.","January 25, 2014","true","4.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

On mechanic level it have item forging, beast capture, and three different types of "simple" puzzle fight (but all three with the same rules).

Enemies can be captured for mounts or to learn new abilities/spells from them that are not available to your selected class (a mount comes with an ability of its own, too). And of course besides the main quest to get rid of Big Evil you get plenty of side quests, helpful companions, and there's even some gossip in taverns to enrich the lore.\n\nExcept the core game mechanic of resolving any kind of challenge that pops up is... a puzzle game of the type "match 3+ pieces in a line", possibly best known from Bejewelled.\n\nDuring standard combat you go in turns with your enemy, gathering different pieces for mana and executing special moves if you have enough, or there's a type of piece to deal direct damage (skulls). Some challenges slightly differ, like training mounts has time limit for turns, capturing enemies is a static puzzle to clear up the whole board, and learning spells is about matching enough different pieces (sadly for the latter it's a failure when you're out of moves, so the hard spells are pretty much impossible to learn from captives or at least not really worth it).\n\nThis mashup works pretty well and is quite addictive, you always want to have just one more battle to advance the story and maybe okay just one more... and the time flies.\n\nGame has some balancing issues though, designers maybe get a bit carried away and some choices of gear/mounts/spells are clearly superior than others, whereas some even work against you if you use them. But of course you don't have to play with a min-maxer attitude for one, and secondly it doesn't really impact the game just makes it bit less complex than you'd think if you decide to ignore most of the choices. But you still have to get to proper levels to use some, and figuring out the real deal is part of fun too :]","January 8, 2013","true","39.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

When I was younger, I had an affair with a married woman. She was late forties, and I was not yet twenty, and oh, man, was she hot. She made Mrs Robinson look like a hippo and made Marie Curie look like a dowdy housewife. She taught me so much, not just about sex, you understand, but about EVERYTHING. She had such verve, and she wanted it all - nothing stood in her way, and if she wanted something, she just took it. That wasn't even her best feature, that was her insatable curiousity. Once she got into something, she got into it and didn't rest until she worked everything out about it. 'Course I realised I wouldn't have her for long, but that was just about the best time of my life\n\nOne thing'll always remind me of her. And yes, it's a sex story. Well she liked to live a little dangerously, let's say. She rarely wore knickers, like, ever and nowhere was too risky for a quick one, shall we say. Anyway, we were shagging in her family home, and her husband was due home in about 10 minutes. Needless to say, we went a bit 'overtime' and we were barely finished when in walks her husband. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself of course, but she just purred - and she really purred - "Doesn't matter, keep going". Well, what could I do? I kept going.\n\nWhen we finished I was really wary about how to make a dignifed exit. Turns out, I didn't need to worry. I should have expected it, but her husband was a beaten man. His expression was blank and empty, and his whole posture just seemed to say oh, another affair? Well, I shoulda guessed a perfect tigress like his wife wouldn't settle with just me. I mean, I don't have self-esteem issues, but she was just something else. So as I walked out, head held high thinking I was just really amazing, like I just invested sex and all, and brimming with afterglow and he said some words to me. Words I'll never forget.\n\nHe said "Puzzle Quest is a pretty amazing mash-up of match 3 and RPG, shame we never got the DLC the consoles did though". And you know what? He was right. But I had just banged his wife, so, y'know, I win.","January 23, 2013","true","89.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","7"

There's a lot i liked about this, but... holy hell, I didn't expect such a massive amount of grinding in a puzzle game!\n\nJust about anything you want to do involves the puzzle grid. Want to make an item? Battle. Want to research a spell? Battle. Wander around the world map? Battle. Talk to a person who only says "who are you?" Battle.\n\nMy first game completion showed 300 games won. Considering some matches can last 10 minutes, this gets old painfully quickly. Whereas Might and Magic Clash of Heroes felt short on battles, this game is the exact opposite. It really is obnoxous, especially when some quests will perpetually throw battles at you until you decide a different option. It almost sickens me to think that there's a bunch of other character classes I have yet to complete.\n\nAs the game goes on, you'll swear that the computer cheats. It almost always does an optimal move, and it finds ways to crank up its mana in few turns. Fortunately you can also become pretty godly, but it takes a long while to reach that point.\n\nAnnoyingly, most of the enemies scale to your own level. This basically means you aren't getting stronger, if your enemies are keeping up with you.\n\nNote that there is an expansion available on the Steam forums for the game. Since the original company basically no longer supports the game, you can grab it for free.\n\nOverall, fun at times, frustrating in many others. I'll give it a 8/10. It certainly kept me busy, and one day if I'm bored I'll probably revisit it for the hell of it.","January 2, 2013","true","34.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My second time buying this game and sixth time playing it through. (A+) 10/10 Killed Lord Bane in three moves, WOULD CRUSH DEMI-GODS AGAIN.\n\nIroniocly the fact that PuzzleQuest: Warlords is almost abandoned is a good thing.

You can play this game for six months on one character campaign, and you still will be willing to play through a second time.\n\nThere are six Puzzle games by Infinite Interactive. This is still their best one. There is an X-pac (Revenge of the Plague Lord) currently not available on Steam at the time of this post, but there is a PC mod for it out there somewhere.

This one also happens to be the first.  I will also note, that at the time of this review I only have 5 hours of gameplay, however have played the first Puzzle Quest on numerous platforms.\n\nI has been ported many times, and has not suffered at all from it.\n\nThe game blends classic RPG elements like leveling, stat building, parties, main and side quests, shops with items and more with a simple match-3 puzzle game concept. It executes it very well.\n\nThe colored gems represent mana, aside from the purple stars and stack of coins which yield experience and gold upon matching. There are also skulls to match that damage your enemy. In puzzle quest your objective is to damage your enemie's health down to zero by either matching skulls or using the mana gained through gems with offensive spells. There are also other types of spells, meant for healing or a form of crowd control so the pace and complexity rises there and can add some fun gameplay and combinations to your moves. There are also the mechanic where if you match more than 3 of anything in one move, you gain an extra turn. The combination of all these makes for exciting, strategic gameplay.\n\nThe cons are that the story is rather stale, but this is firstly a puzzle game before anything else and can easily become overlooked. That is the only negative thing I can really come up with. Clever game; good fun. Highly recommended.","January 4, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Basically it is a match the color game with RPG concepts.  You level up, gain skills/stats, collect items to add passive traits, and by all accounts the story mode is at least 30 hours long (I played 9 hours.)\n\nIt has quite a bit of depth for this type of match the color puzzle game:  You basically battle AI or a person to cause damage to each other by matching skulls or casting spells by matching colors.\n\nThe reason I am not finishing it... 9 hours in and I do not feel like playing anymore because it feels like Color Match Grinding.  Interesting but the random aspect can someone skrew you over or make a boss a joke.  The random stuff can be frustrating that actually makes it boring after a few hours.\n\nWorth it if you like this sort of thing!~","March 10, 2012","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The twist is the jewels you match translate into the mana you use for skills, and many skills inflect statuses on the field itself. It comes down to a surprising mix of casual and strategy, as you wonder if you should clear all the blue tiles to make other mana easier to collect, or if you should remove all red to keep your opponent from unleashing his best attacks? Where's the best place to remove a 3x3 area? If I remove this one, will it start a 4x chain? Will doing this avalanch?\n\nThe battle system is better refined in the sequel, Puzzle Quest 2, but future itterations of Puzzle Quest (of which there are a surprising amount) all fail in one major thing Puzzle Quest nailed: The sheer variety of things to do. Puzzle Quest has mechanics for taking over cities, capturing monsters, learning their spells, acquiring allies, and several other features that future games simply don't have. It is for these varities that make Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords the best in the series.\n\nThe last point to mention is that Puzzle Quest works with mods. It is extremely important to mention, however, that Steam's support for these mods is limited. While mods for the game work fine (and are easy enough for me to make, say, a new class in a day or two) and are generally pretty neat (the new items mod adds several items, each of which can completely change the strategy you use throughout the game), Steam Cloud undoes most of this effort as any backed up modded files will be automatically downloaded sans mods to any future computer- causing frequent crashes and problems for future itterations.","December 27, 2011","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my review. I've actually played the game.\n\nTHIS GAME IS AMAZING!\n\nFirst off, the MUSIC! The music just gets you right into that "match things" mood. If you are kicking behind, it ramps up with your adrenaline and you push yourself to an epic win. If you are losing... well, let's just say you'll know that tune and when the announcer chimes in that your hero is near defeat it's totally okay to start sweating.\n\nNext, the actual game play is so smooth! Some matching games can be kind of jerky or have a slower response time. Puzzle Quest does not! It is smooth and seemless. The battle load screens don't last too long and walking about in the RP world isn't cumbersome or annoying. You can even rapidly click through dialoge if you don't care and just want to fight!\n\nDid I mention the music? Because this is seriously some of the best music.\n\nAlso worth a paragraph is the strategy aspect. If you play correctly and put some thought into it, this game can be as intense and engaging as a game of chess. I have logged my 600+ hours on almost exclusively my druid, who should be one of the wimpiest in the game. However, using tactics and planning, she can whoop any enemy. Pick your skills, items, spells, and mounts carefully. Know your enemy's weaknesses. Know the board mechanics. Manipulate everything to your will and you will surely master Puzzle Quest.\n\nOf course, after 600+ hours you would think I would be bored with the game, right?\n\nNOT AT ALL! I return to PQ faithfully on a regular basis when I want a respite from the world of MMOs, MOBAs, and RTSs.\n\nSo go on, what are you waiting for?\n\nThe original sucky review by my husband who has NEVER PLAYED THE GAME: It's like Bejeweled except you fight and the music is way more epic than it should be, but it's still a wonderful game.","July 10, 2011","true","722.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I mean I knew it was going to be pretty good because of all the positive reviews over the years, but wow. Exceeded expectations tremendously.\n\nThe more I play it, the more features I find, the more I appreciate it. At first I logged a few hours with a warrior, got a decent hold on how to play, and then started over with a wizard and was amazed to find that, compared to the warrior, playing as a wizard feels like playing as a wizard, despite it being a match 3. And then the different items and spells and stats I choose can allow for very different strategies on the same character.\n\nAnd then I found the citadel stuff. You solve different kinds of puzzles in order to capture enemies, forge new items, learn new spells. That's also pretty neat.\n\nAlso the story and dialog is pretty good.\n\nThere are two drawbacks though\n- The music gets repetetive\n- The random element can get out of hand, in a frustrating way. For example, one time a boss comboed me for 80% of my health before I even got my first turn. I quickly lost thereafter. Then in my next attempt he only did a more typical 10% or so before my first turn.\n\nAnyway great game, super fantastic. 99/10. amazing","July 22, 2015","true","68.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The twist is the jewels you match translate into the mana you use for skills, and many skills inflect statuses on the field itself. It comes down to a surprising mix of casual and strategy, as you wonder if you should clear all the blue tiles to make other mana easier to collect, or if you should remove all red to keep your opponent from unleashing his best attacks? Where's the best place to remove a 3x3 area? If I remove this one, will it start a 4x chain? Will doing this avalanch?\n\nThe battle system is better refined in the sequel, Puzzle Quest 2, but future itterations of Puzzle Quest (of which there are a surprising amount) all fail in one major thing Puzzle Quest nailed: The sheer variety of things to do. Puzzle Quest has mechanics for taking over cities, capturing monsters, learning their spells, acquiring allies, and several other features that future games simply don't have. It is for these varities that make Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords the best in the series.\n\nThe last point to mention is that Puzzle Quest works with mods. It is extremely important to mention, however, that Steam's support for these mods is limited. While mods for the game work fine (and are easy enough for me to make, say, a new class in a day or two) and are generally pretty neat (the new items mod adds several items, each of which can completely change the strategy you use throughout the game), Steam Cloud undoes most of this effort as any backed up modded files will be automatically downloaded sans mods to any future computer- causing frequent crashes and problems for future itterations.","December 27, 2011","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you even remotely like those types of games to begin with all the extra stuff this adds to it to make it more of an actual game plus the RPG aspects+story on top of it makes it great especially for the cheap price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/recommended/12500/","Deimenried","Deimenried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deimenried/","240 products in account","This is quite a difficult game to truly love, but it was certainly more than enough to hold my interest. It can only be described as an RPG crossed with Bejewelled. So I guess in effect it is Bejewelled with a purpose, utilising a system of coloured gems to fill mana reserves to use special abilities and attacks, skulls to deal direct damage with your weapon or gold & xp gems to boost your cash and level respectively.\n\nMuch like an RPG it involves a class system which doesn't limit what equipment you can wield, but affects what abilities you can use. The class also determines the nature of your powers - Warriors will generally gain abilities to increase attack or deal direct damage while mages can change gems on the board or remove them entirely.\n\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking that this is a dream union of two very different genres, but it's in the storytelling which lets this game down. The story is the same old recycled "Dark Lord guy comes back from the dead.. again.. and wants to kill everyone" RPG cliche. This in itself isn't a crime, but the fetch/kill side-quests don't really do much to appeal to your adventurous side with often difficult fights combined with relatively poor rewards, coupled with the "random encounters" which are merely the same monster appearing and disappearing on the same route. Free roaming is not on the cards, but rather a system of clicking on destinations on a 2-D overworld map linked by lines to represent travellable routes. The Tavern system isn't that cracking either with the "rumours" not being worth the coin you pay, mostly as they are things you'll figure out yourself by PLAYING THE GAME or have absolutely no useful information whatsoever.\n\nNow, if there is a dealbreaker in choosing this game it is without a doubt the AI. It is painfully obvious when the computer "player" makes a mistake (eg. forfeiting a turn bonus by missing an oppertunity for 4 or 5-in-a-row, a row of skulls etc.) that is very very obvious. Also, when they make said mistakes they seem to have some kind of uncanny luck, as these mistakes seem to trigger big combos dropping down from the top, almost as if they know the order of the gems above the top row in play. You will often find you fumble and struggle for similar combinations, or any good combinations at all.\n\nAll in all, the game isn't bad. If you can overlook the dialogue, the rigid "exploration" and the AI, which if it were a person would have won the lottery a dozen times over, you will find a largely enjoyable experience with some nice artwork and visuals. If it's going cheap, get it!","July 13, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat and puzzles are surprisingly deep, though there is an element of randomness that can hand you a match... or hand you your ♥♥♥ if the patterns fall in the CPU's favor.\n\nThere's no real start up time to the game and it autosaves between every match, so you could definitely use this as a time waster inbetween work or whatever. Just don't get it if you're easily absorbed -- you might end up spending hours playing match three.","February 3, 2014","true","44.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am a lover of all types of bejeweled games and love the aspect of having it be a turn by turn elimation game. There are some things that aren't so great about it though. Like for some enemies, unless you know exactly what you are doing, you are going to lose, multiple times. Also I think there should be a difficulty settings for people so that you can set if you just want to casually play or super strategically think about every move. It is so much better than jsut trying to click as many as 3 or more sets together. Also having powers to use gives it an even more interesting aspect so you are not just trying to grind skulls the whole time.\nOne thing I wish you could do was better selection for your character, so being able to be the monsters that you face would be kind of cool.\nSidenote, I think the AI is always super lucky. And also I try to attempt to not do any of the 'hint' moves because I always get screwed over, like taking the hint and getting 3 yellow, then it drops so the AI gets a X9 multipler with a 4in a row then a 4 in a row skulls, then a 5 in a row.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChrisDaPatriot/recommended/12500/","ChrisDaPatriot","Vintage ChrisDaPatriot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChrisDaPatriot/","323 products in account","Puzzle Quest is a fantastic little ''gem'' of a casual match-3 puzzle game with some RPG elements thrown in. The story is the typical fantasy fair with orcs, ogres and the like, the characters are usually stereotypes, but can be interesting at times. The game really shines in its blending of match-3 puzzle mechanics with RPG spells and stats. There's also a few different modes that come from different actions you can take, such as interesting puzzles you have to solve in order to capture creatures to learn their spells, or a modified version of a standard battle where you have to match anvil shaped gems to craft items  It really helps break up the monotony of random battles. The game can get really intense and there will be times when it feels like there's a ton of things going right for the computer, but make sure to always think ahead when mathing certain gems and it will make things much better.  The one gripe I have with the game is the constant random battles you can't avoid unless you train your mount to the appropriate level, which takes a lot of grinding in and of itself, so it can drag on, but when that happens you can always just quit and come back later.\n\nThe music is also something I wanted to touch on. It's surprisingly good. Some of the tracks are a bit "eh" in terms of sound quality, but what some lack in sound quality others make up in composition quality. Many of the songs are exceedingly catchy and really help to convey the mood of a certain location or bolster the feeling of winning/losing in a battle. The boss battle theme and the Dwarven theme are probably my favorites.\n\nIf you enjoy match-3 games with a surprising bit of depth, RPGs with a twist, or both, then you'll probably be able to sink many, many hours into this addictively fun game. It's a great time waster, especially since it can run on most any rig, I personally play it on my laptop in class sometimes. It's a game that's been on everything from the DS, PSP, Xbox 360 and even old, mobile phones, I've owned it on my old circa 2006 Nokia and fat DS, even, and definitely do not regret picking it up a third time.","April 13, 2015","true","343.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my review. I've actually played the game.\n\nTHIS GAME IS AMAZING!\n\nFirst off, the MUSIC! The music just gets you right into that "match things" mood. If you are kicking behind, it ramps up with your adrenaline and you push yourself to an epic win. If you are losing... well, let's just say you'll know that tune and when the announcer chimes in that your hero is near defeat it's totally okay to start sweating.\n\nNext, the actual game play is so smooth! Some matching games can be kind of jerky or have a slower response time. Puzzle Quest does not! It is smooth and seemless. The battle load screens don't last too long and walking about in the RP world isn't cumbersome or annoying. You can even rapidly click through dialoge if you don't care and just want to fight!\n\nDid I mention the music? Because this is seriously some of the best music.\n\nAlso worth a paragraph is the strategy aspect. If you play correctly and put some thought into it, this game can be as intense and engaging as a game of chess. I have logged my 600+ hours on almost exclusively my druid, who should be one of the wimpiest in the game. However, using tactics and planning, she can whoop any enemy. Pick your skills, items, spells, and mounts carefully. Know your enemy's weaknesses. Know the board mechanics. Manipulate everything to your will and you will surely master Puzzle Quest.\n\nOf course, after 600+ hours you would think I would be bored with the game, right?\n\nNOT AT ALL! I return to PQ faithfully on a regular basis when I want a respite from the world of MMOs, MOBAs, and RTSs.\n\nSo go on, what are you waiting for?\n\nThe original sucky review by my husband who has NEVER PLAYED THE GAME: It's like Bejeweled except you fight and the music is way more epic than it should be, but it's still a wonderful game.","July 10, 2011","true","722.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

A bejewelled clone that tries to be an RPG but forgets that RPGs are traditionally games of skill and strategy and Bejewelled is a game of chance. There's a reason these two styles of gameplay shouldn't be mixed and that reason is on brilliant display in this game; Because the matches are adversarial, and you play against an enemy AI, it is not only possible but inevitable that the game is going to spend a lot of time punishing you for not having a good move when the game gave you no good moves to make. You're going to lose, a lot, and through no fault of your own.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the game cheats. Like, a lot. It's not unusual to have a match where you get two or three moves in and then you're just buried under a chain of like 20-25 enemy free turns. Enemies with little or no spell resistance will resist 5 spells in a row, or resist a spell that uses fire and earth mana with air resistance. Enemy items and spells have bonuses written by people who don't understand how math scales. The AI always behaves as though it has perfect knowledge of all moves on the board and perfect knowledge of all gems that will fall as a result of those moves, whether you're fighting a level 1 rat at the beginning of the game or the big boss.\n\nThe only way to enjoy this game was to trivialize it. To grind gold and farm skills until I could generate damage so easily it almost didn't matter that the game could seemingly win matches at will. Even with a highly optimized wizard with rediculous stats and a meticulous battle strategy, I still managed to only win about 70% of fights. Otherwise you're in for 300-400+ boards of head-banging frustration.\n\nIf you like casual puzzle games like Bejewelled, you're probably going to be much happier finding a pure puzzle game instead of this hybridized pile of misery.","September 29, 2015","false","33.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where to start? Nobody really seems to know what Puzzle Quest is whenever I bring it up. I stumbled upon this game thanks to my partner who had already purchased the game on ps3 and coaxed me into giving it a go. Side note and rant: The pc version is a mangled mess. Playing with real human opponents is where this game shines the most... but because the developers screwed up the net code so bad, online multiplayer is a total bust. I've never been able to get it to work - ever. If I am missing something please let me know!!! I'd love to have a working version of this game on my pc. Anyway, so I spent the most time playing this game on ps3. It is a game I still enjoy and hope to pick up again this Fall. It never gets boring to me. I primarily play this game in couch coop mode utilizing the same screen as my partner. We have a variety of level 25 through 50 characters and one must really strategize which spells to cast on your opponent and the best time to do it. It is much more than a puzzle matching game. Again, it comes to live when you have a friend to play it with and you move beyond the lower levels and you start obtaining powerful spells. Looking forward to a TRUE sequel to this (if they ever make one) and no, I do not mean PQ2 which was cheapened and much of the game world uninspired and lackluster.","August 28, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean I knew it was going to be pretty good because of all the positive reviews over the years, but wow. Exceeded expectations tremendously.\n\nThe more I play it, the more features I find, the more I appreciate it. At first I logged a few hours with a warrior, got a decent hold on how to play, and then started over with a wizard and was amazed to find that, compared to the warrior, playing as a wizard feels like playing as a wizard, despite it being a match 3. And then the different items and spells and stats I choose can allow for very different strategies on the same character.\n\nAnd then I found the citadel stuff. You solve different kinds of puzzles in order to capture enemies, forge new items, learn new spells. That's also pretty neat.\n\nAlso the story and dialog is pretty good.\n\nThere are two drawbacks though\n- The music gets repetetive\n- The random element can get out of hand, in a frustrating way. For example, one time a boss comboed me for 80% of my health before I even got my first turn. I quickly lost thereafter. Then in my next attempt he only did a more typical 10% or so before my first turn.\n\nAnyway great game, super fantastic. 99/10. amazing","July 22, 2015","true","68.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
