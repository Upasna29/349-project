Yet, there's no story, and outside the "quest", there isn't much to see.\nIt is well done and entertaining enough to keep you hooked a bit. Although, this edpisode suffers from the same problem as the previous episodes : it doesn't like when you play too fast and the game doesn't detect all the totem triggers (matching the same color twice in a row).\n\nThere are 70 "stages" to play through, overall, plus 3 without number (some bonus stage to collect "marbles", "tablets" and I don't remember the third one).\nThere are achievements in there, albeit not "steam" ones. That's where the playing time will be spent - replaying the same stages over and over to reach one or another achievement.\n\nI'm running this on Win7 without problem, save the bonus levels: "Marbles" and "tablets" simply hang the game at some point, going back to Windows. No error message, no warning, no nothing. Just the loss of any progress since the last time you were in the "menu" of the game. I wasn't able to detect a logical reason save, maybe, when those stages are played too long - it is set up for 1:00 minute, however, with the totems and bonuses, it can last way longer. Not sure this is the reason, though.\n","March 12","true","12.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Worth buying.\n\nNote: doesn't seem to have full steam features yet, but with this dev - they usually come later.\nThe game is about 7 hours long. When you finish it - you play again and do some achievements. So bear in mind that is quite short.","March 10","true","15.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game is a gem matching one with a variety of game modes: destroy tokens, collect gems(which is the most used one), collect flasks, find artifacts, collect fireflies, collect golden lizards, collect gold nugets and collect ancient amulets, and a total of 70 levels and 3 bonus level: destroy colored stones, destroy marbles and collect gems(can also be called classic mode) which have a basic time limit of 1 minute which can be extended via totems or bonuses.\n\nIn the last sentence I mentioned totems and bonuses. For each 5 completed levels you unlock a totem or a bonus(they come in the totem-bonus sequence). There are 7 totems, one for each gem color, and 6 bonuses, which can be upgraded four times in the store. The currency for the store is gems, which can be obtained by completing levels, completing the in-game achievements, from chests and from the slot machine. The rewards for completing achievements are gems and tokens for the slot machine. The chests each reward you with 150 gems and 3 tokens for the slot machine and require five golden keys which can be obtained by beating a given score for each level. The slot machine have 5 symbols: 10,20,30 gems , a token for the slot machine or a montezuma masks, making 3 masks giving you a jackpot, and 3 reels.\n\nThis is the first game that I play from the game series so I am unable to compare it with its predecessors.\n\nThe game doesn't feature a notable story. At the begining of the game you get informed that you get close to the ancient city of Aztec where Montezuma ruled and stored untold riches and that's all of it.\n\nThe music is good for concentration.\n\nIf you are interested in this aspect, the game feature trading cards, but lacks achievements.\n\nNote - This game was reviewed using a key provided by the publisher.","March 16","true","6.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It seems like they tried to add some story, but abandoned that idea after obnoxious mobile-level restricting tutorial. Playing field is still cluttered and noisy, but super-score now is not that intrusive, on the flip side, now it's not as obvious as before, so you have to use audio cues to track it. Also it seems like it has a lot of f2p rudiments. Core scoring system became much easier, there are several money-grind levels, so you can buy more power-ups before retrying failed main level. But again, because of that, green statue became super OP on the early levels.\n\nWorks fine with nvidia surround. Unlike 3rd game this one works very stable.\n\nDespite all the flaws it's one of the more challenging and complex games in the genre, while being definitely finite, which pleases my inner completionist and gives me incentive to play it. Finished it in one 7 hour sitting.","March 11","true","7.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
