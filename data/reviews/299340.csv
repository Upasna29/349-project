It suffers from the sadly all-too-common problem of being unable to decide if it wants to be serious or funny, and in trying to do both it fails to do either.  The plot is so thin that, if it is ever discovered, will revolutionalize the world of particle physics.\n\nGlueing random stuff together to make funky spaceships seems like a winning formula and it would be if it meant anything, but it doesn't.  The glue is a system of support beams to make sure that nothing ever actually touches, so your dreams of a hodge-podge junk ship quickly dillute into a flying, 3D flowchart.\n\nThe missions, combat, and trivial amount of other gameplay elements cannot hope to hide that they were all added as an afterthought to the main game, and the main game is a one-trick pony.  A gimmick.  A novel idea, sure, and one that is being used in other games out there.  But it is still just a gimmick, and gimmicks do not make for good gameplay cores.\n\nSo what is there besides attaching random modules to a space station, flying it around and doing a few random things to advance the "story?"  Well, let's list them all:\n\nSo now that we're done with that list, I will conclude by saying that if this is what a "complete" game feels like then I give up.  This would make a fine Smartphone distraction to goof around with while sipping a beer and waiting for your date to arrive and probably worth the $5 you paid for it, in such a context.  In the context of a PC game in the 21st century?  Let me put it this way: If a good PC game is like an order of nachos deluxe with all the toppings, this is game is a few saltine crackers with some cheeze whiz on top.  Not bad as a snack, but not very filling, and certainly not a real meal.","January 27","false","10.7"," 46 of 57 people (81%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","81","46","57","21","0"

The flight is really difficult, though made a little easier by proper booster placement and hotkey assignment. Maybe some kind of inertial dampening block would be handy to stabilise your ship. (Edit - an "emergency full stop" isn't really inertial dampening...)\n\nAs far as the combat goes, you clumsily maneuver yourself into a position where you MIGHT be able to attack a station and then fire your lasers - the station is dead more or less immediately without putting up a fight. You then realise your next target isn't that far away, were it not for the difficulty in getting that short distance - you will spin all the way around at least 2 or 3 times. Once you're there, same story. There isn't much incentive to build beyond your initial working ship - maybe an engineer limit based on habitat pods would be more of an incentive.\n\nOh yes, the ship will also bump into nothing, causing a change in trajectory, when you had only just got it pointing the way you wanted.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's fun and it has a fair amount of potential but at £11 the price is much too high for a game which offers little at this stage and has no save feature.\n\nEDIT: It's worth pointing out that by now this review is fairly old and the game will continue to develop with time. I had felt that at the time my review was fair but should have been taken with a pinch of salt because I am more than aware of how games in alpha are. It is also worth keeping in mind that with early access the old "alpha/beta" defining lines are somewhat blurred and "it's an alpha" is not a blanket excuse for exclusion of basic features. This game is fun, keep an eye on it - but be aware of the limits of early development.","July 17, 2014","false","0.9"," 169 of 261 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","169","261","0","10"

At first it seems very simple, but a few minutes in and the depth of the experience is unavoidable.  This sandbox spacestation construction set is very slow paced but so obviously full of potential.  Be warned, if you are not a patient person, don't bother with this title.  On the other hand, if you have a little patients, and are the type of person to delve into a sandbox and make your own fun, you'll love this game.\n\nEssentially, you fly around a 2D section of space collecting garbage and attaching it to your space station.  The junk you find will range anywhere from burger joints to old retired satilites.  Within moments of firing up the game I had already attached an old sherman tank to the front of my station.  What's better is that this junk isn't just garbage, they are upgrades.  I could use the tank to fire cannon balls at other debre floating through space, for fun and also to clear a path.  Later, I found a lunar lander and tossed it on the back of my station and used it's engines for some extra speed.\n\nMany elements of Habitat remind me of RTS games.  You have resources that must be collected/generated, such as Omni (money), Electricity (power), and Fuel (more different power), and the amounts you generate depend on how you've built up your station and what junk you've attached to it.  So, rather than sending some peons to go gather coal, I attached a solar array to the back of my station so that I generated more electricity.\n\nPart of the strategy involved in this title is balancing your ship build.  If you have too much weight/mass on one side or the other, the ship will fly crooked.  This ultimately lead to constant corrections by firing my boosters on one side of the ship in bursts while the other side remained at full blast.  I realized later that I could actually adjust the individual output of each of my boosters so that all the engines could be left on simultaniously and the station would still fly straight, that is until I added more junk!\n\nDid I mention you can also control where the power in your station is distributed?  There are three catagories, Weapons, Boosters, and Power.  More energy in weapons... actually, I haven't tried that, so I don't know what it does, but more power in the Boosters makes you go faster, and more power in Power, gives a bonus to your resource generation.\n\nIt is a unique experience and a lot of fun, but it definitely takes some time to get used to, and it takes even more time to accomplish anything!  As of this writing, the game is still in early release, so hopfully the pacing is tweaked a little before release, but even if not, I still wouldn't pass it up.  Good game, great experience, and I'm looking forward to watching this one come along as it gets closer to release and beyond.\n\nTL;DR?\n\nIf you're patient and enjoy playing in a silly space sandbox full of junk and potential, then this game is definitely for you.  If you're not a patient gamer, and/or sandboxes and making a bit of your own fun aren't your thing, then give this one a pass.","December 18, 2014","true","3.2"," 43 of 55 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","43","55","0","0"

The general idea — welding together random space junk to make a funky spaceship — is a lot of fun. But the controls are rough — you can add lots of faster engines, but you have to turn each of them on and off individually, so it makes steering and controlling your speed difficult. And when enemies attack, they don't fly in from outer space, they just appear — often in the middle of your ship! I can fight off pirates when they pull up alongside me; it's a different story when they materialize inside my ship, wiping out half of it before I can make a move. Worst of all, there's no clear way of saving the game, so you lose progress constantly. All of these issues taken together suck the fun out of what would otherwise be a terrific game.","March 11","false","15.1"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","1"

A full review will be published once Habitat has released. By the way, I have a lot more hours than it says, it just wouldn't calculate any of the time for me while it wasn't on the Steam Store.\n\nHabitat is a real-time, physics-driven orbital strategy game where you build, fly, and fight with the unique space stations that you create out of space debris orbiting earth. In its simplest terms it is a strategic space survival game. It is being developed by 4gency and being published by Versus Evil. It's available on Steam's Early Access - as stated above - for $14.99.\n\nHabitat was one of my most anticipated indie games of 2014 when I first saw the Kickstarter. From then I followed it to where it is today. I was able to have a review copy to review. Saying that, there were of course some bugs that have been squashed out, but none of the bugs prevent it from being playable.\n\nHabitat feels like a space sandbox where you can literally make whatever you want with the space debris orbiting around Earth. That includes thrusters, boosters, dinosaur heads, Statue of Liberty heads, anything that's there you can add. This gives players total freedom on what they want their ship to look like. For me; I put the dinosaur head on the top of my rocket ship, with boosters on either side and a controllable booster near the top.\n\nThe controls are very easy to learn and do not feel clunky. Graphics are alright, but nothing spectacular, as they aren't the focus of this game. The focus is to have fun building a space ship that YOU made as well as fighting various enemies in the game. Can't wait to see what some of the people's ships look like as well as hoping for Steam Workshop!\n\n9/10 - Brilliant!","July 8, 2014","true","19.1"," 102 of 172 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","102","172","0","10"

An engineer camera?).  It technically works, but still feels broken and unfinished.\n\nEven after improvements to the controls and tutorial, what systems there are in the game seem obtuse, and controlling your crafts is still too finicky and unpredictable to take seriously or strategically, and too slow and management-intensive to be silly and fun.  The constant building of your ship is equally too detail and control heavy to be light and easy, while the constant RE-building of your ship quickly saps at any enjoyment from the design and strategic planning (struts are not fun!).  Thankfully many of the tasks for the engineers are automated to some degree, but ordering them to do anything specific becomes an exercise in frustrating hunt-and-click vs the camera.\n\nIt might still be worth it to pick up (on a heavily discounted sale) and play around with in the sandbox, but the campaign is a farce.  Which, considering the tone of the game and what little I was able to glean of the 'story' in-game, could actually be intentional in some brilliant meta-design by the creators, but I very much doubt that.  One can only hope that this game's developers will continue to support their game and all the promise the idea had, and perhaps reevaluate some of their design decisions.\n\n\nI'm incredibly bummed I can't get a refund for this.  I guess this is my own personal lesson on supporting Early Access games on faith and interest in a concept.","February 1","false","2.0"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

A quick and dirty description of it would be an arcade game.  The game is not intended to be a long term play and you will restart the game multiple times just trying to figure out what everything does.  It isn't super intuitive which in the beginning will lead you to believe you can accomplish a number of things which will then result in you blowing up your station just because you didn't know you couldn't do that.  That kind of learning process is getting more and more common in games though (not happy about that really).  It is a good 5-60 min game that will entertain.  My rating of this game is a $4.99 game that could be worth $9.99 to someone that really likes the game.  Just remember that at $9.99 that's a roll of quarters at an arcade (i'm showing my age here).  Personally, i'd spend a roll of quarters on a different game.","September 30, 2014","false","2.0"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","29","44","0","0"

That lead (in my case) to a total confusing start in the real game.\n\nSame in the 2nd tutorial ... it is a bit awkward to be shown rockets on the side and later not to know that isn't possible ... and the unlink function is disabled (aka. completely missing).\n\nThere is also the issue of the camera angle ... everything in this game with this gameplay screams "I am meant to play top down" but the camera won't let you (probably a objection from the artist: "but think about all those great 3D models") ... leaving your ship in the way all the time.\n\nThe other not great thing is that ship parts towed by your crew can be towed through your ship ... which should be changed in later versions so that is moved under or above your ship. ... That shouldn't be too hard.\n\nThe game ends up starting throwing you unprepared in middle of literally one million things from what are more than enough enemies.\n\nThe circumstance that you have to do one million things and that there is no way to slow it down seems to me as preperation for making it multiplayer. But multiplayer can lead to all sorts of problems in this kind of game.\n\nSo what I am missing is a third part of the tutorial in which is everything present, but no enemies ... so that you really can learn how to build and how to use the UI.\n\nOr at least an easy mode for the game ... a "slow" start (in which you won't encounter enemies for at least a while after starting the game) would also do.\n\n","June 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 35 of 55 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","35","55","4","0"

That's not this game.\n\nInstead, this game is a wacky space comedy where you have to lash together floating cruise ships (how the hell does that happen) and mount a floating Statue of Liberty head that comes pre-fabed with lasers in her eyeballs to make an intrastellar battleship that you must send forth to attack unnamed incoming aliens.\n\nThe joint system was on the fritz for me so some of my ships tore themselves to pieces and there's no plot to speak of yet.  But then again, it's Early Access.\n\nI think they should have a hanger where you can build ships out of resources you recycle (metal, solar panels, plastic, etc) from the space crap and then send the ships out to do combat on their own.  I should not have to control the ships and build their replacements all at the same time.  I'm a simple man with simple thoughts.\n\nI'll reserve judgement, but it's not looking good.

You can build multible ships which is cool and toggle between them. theres a few bugs, like my engineers dying from lack of living space when i have 4 living towers, but not many major game breaking bugs.

Until they realized that they didn’t need us. We dug this hole. Now our choice is to either fight our way out of it, or to lay in it.\n\nHabitat is an Early Access single player, and soon to be multiplayer, space survival game with an emphasis on strategy and a bit of action sprinkled on top. Brought to us by developer 4Gency and its publisher Versus Evil, the main idea behind this game is that you’ve been given the task of constructing and maintaining an orbital base for humanity out of the thousands of years of space junk that now surrounds the planet. Why, you may ask? At some point in the future, humanity builds nanomachines, which then turn on us. They’ve managed to nearly take over the entire planet, forcing humanity out into space. If that weren’t enough, they’re smart enough to send out little clouds of nanomachines into space to come and wipe the rest of us out.\n\nAs mentioned before, this is primarily a strategy-survival kind of game. When you first start, you’re dropped off with your Habitat in a procedurally-generated sandbox full of scrap goods to use. You might find small things like a random burger shop floating around, or even the head of the Statue of Liberty (complete with fully-functional laser blasting powers!) that you can junction to your ship and use as a weapon. By junctioning this junk, you are able to provide your ship with more resources and weaponry, which you will need if humanity is to survive. In addition to adding things to your ship, you must manage your team of engineers, who are the ones who actually go out and drag and attach the various items to your ship, as well as keep maintenance.\n\nIn terms of enemies you face, there’s currently not much. You have the hunter clouds that the nanomachines send, and other enemy habitats. Hunter clouds originate from the nanomachines down on Earth, and as far as I can tell, the machines just fart them out into space to kill you. They’re pretty relentless, too. Enemy habitats function similarly to you, but instead of cramming the first piece of junk they see onto their space station, they come pre-built and ready to mess up the first person that floats their way. Like I said before, 4Gency confirmed that they would be adding multiplayer later on down the development road, so it will be interesting to see how terrible other players are at controlling their habitats compared to me.\n\nOne of the main problems that I ran into while playing was the lack of an in-game tutorial, so that those of us with a smaller attention span are forced to actually learn exactly through gameplay what it is they’re supposed to be doing. As of this moment, the only explanation you get is a “How To Play” option on the main menu, which just flat-out tells you through text what you are able to do. Personally, I learn gameplay mechanics better when I’m taught them during the course of the game. Another issue I had was aiming. Currently, if you have all your weapons on say, one side of your ship for some reason, and the enemy comes the opposite side, you’ll need to slowly spin your ship all the way around to face them, and then carefully line up your shot before you can begin firing. Even then, you probably won’t hit them because even after you disable your ship thrusters, your ship will continue spinning due to the fact that you’re floating around in space. It would be great if there were some way to ease up the whole process.\n\nAll that aside visually the game looks good enough. The models and textures look nice, and it seems to be decently optimized, so performance shouldn’t be too much of an issue. The music is rather soothing, and the rest of the sound in general is pretty good in quality. Overall, Habitat is something that has a bit of potential as long as the developers continue working on it. You can currently find Habitat for sale on Steam for $14.99.\n\nhttp://wtbfun.com/habitat-an-early-look/","October 15, 2014","true","1.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

Sandbox meets space battles is the best one could do. The game requires alot more thought than I originally imagined. It seems simple in concept, grabbing random space debris to make a ship, then you find yourself attacked with calculations and math theory just to get your ship flying straight, Sure you can get by with guessing and such, but for the engineer wanna be, you have power levels to control, and energy to creation/expenditure manage, andmultiple ships. This game is very indepth, and with the updates this game continues to get better. I see great things for this game.\n\nNow, don't take this review as the game is extremely stellar either (See what I did there :) ) There is a fwe things still needing some work, this game is in early access, so keep that in mind. You will find somethings hard to click on, I'd say this is the worst part in the game so far (Which is rather a small thing, you have to rotate the camera a little bit sometimes) and the movement can feel a little slow at times.\n\nFor a note on the best things in the game, the quests are decent challenge for starting off, and progress to mroe difficult, the tutorial is done well, and the enjoyment of finding new objects and figuring out hwo they work, with the ocassional item damaging your ship cause you didn't think it through very much is humorous.","December 17, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay starts off a little slow, but that's to be expected when you're colonizing space and wading through centuries of junk.\n\nOverall, I'm very impressed with the game as-is, and would consider it a complete sandbox. I'm excited to see what the future brings for Habitat. I did not have any issues or bugs while playing, and in-game tutorials and hints were measured but informative. My only issue with the game is that on creation of a new game, you are plopped right into the mix with no warning or opening. That's an opinion thing, though.

The game is being developed by 4gency who were formed in 2011 and the game itself was successfully kickstarted to the tune of $64,000 as of May 2nd 2014. The game is still currently in Alpha and as such things are subject to change.\n\nHabitat places you in the role of ensuring humanities survival in orbit of the now inhospitable planet earth. By leading a team of engineers you are able to build space stations from an array of space debris and salvage. You'll have to manage your resources throughout the game making sure you have enough fuel to move and more. That being said currently in alpha resource management is very easy and means little once you've built up a big enough habitat as you'll be gaining more resource than you'll be able to spend.\n\nBuilding your space stations is simple and straight forward. Each piece of debris has connector points that can be connected to adjacent buildings. There is an array of debris to use to build up your habitat including some comedic pieces including the Eiffel tower, burger restaurants and lady liberties head which has been transformed into a laser cannon. There’s no right or wrong way to build your habitats, you have the freedom to create all shapes and sizes. However movement is somewhat difficult as you'll be using an assortment of rockets and boosters which in turn with the size of your habitat could make fast manoeuvres impossible. Its often best to outfit your habitat with an array of weaponry facing all sides to make sure the enemies don't catch you in a blind spot.\n\nExploration in habitat is currently not the easiest task to take on. The way the physics in the game work coupled with having to activate your motley assortment of rockets and boosters individually means that movement is quite slow and clunky. Precision flying is very difficult and often you have to come to a complete stop much of the time to face the direction you want to go. As you explore you'll encounter more objects to add to your ships as well as enemies to fight, some will be other space stations and others will be a insidious cloud of nanites bent on tracking you down.\n\nIn terms of combat thus far in alpha there's an hilarious assortment of weapons to choose from. Everything from full battle tanks to dubstep spewing speakers are available and all have specific purposes. Combat can at times just be a complete mess especially with manoeuvring being the way it is. Its often best to build smaller attack vessels that are easier to move around and often faster so that your not just a hulking mass ready to be destroyed. With the most recent alpha update you can also send your engineers over to sabotage enemy ships though they are sitting targets that cannot take many hits.\n\nWhat’s good about Habitat thus far is that’s its fun, despite its current issues there is a good degree of  fun building up your wacky ships out of statue heads and school buses. Habitat does hold a certain amount of potential however whether it manages to reach that potential remains to be seen. There’s still a good amount of content yet to come into habitat including a campaign mode something which I certainly would like to see. There are a couple of things the game certainly requires at this point including more objects to build your ships with, better rockets and boosters to improve travel and ultimately I would like to see the resource management part expanded.\n\nThe idea that people are living on your habitat should come more into focus. Population issues, food issues and more would be a really good thing to come into play. An example of this would be that when the population reaches its max, you need to find more debris that people can live in or when food is low you need to find debris that produces a food resource. Management aspects like this would go a long way to making the experience better overall and provide a better space simulator feel.","July 30, 2014","true","1.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

While it may be a very simple game in its current state, with objectives able to be beaten in under an hour, it has all the basics of a game capable of being nearly as big a game as Kerbal Space Program.\n\nSo what does this game currently have to offer?  Well, in its current state, not much.  I've only got around 3 hours of game time under my belt as of writing this, but that's with completing the main objectives twice and screwing around for about an hour.  There's a distinct lack of things to do right now, other than strapping debris to your ship and blowing up 5 enemies.  If you're skilled, you can actually make two ships for yourself and try running two battles at once, or fight yourself to the death.  I'm not skilled.\n\nWhat will definitely improve this game would be things along the line of resources that your habitat constantly consumes that you would need to replenish (which is something planned for in the future of the game).  I know the first update they're applying is going to add electricity and fuel, which will certainly make for more interesting habitat designs.\n\nOne thing I've seen a lot of people complaining about is that there is a lack of a save function, with some going so far as to say that no save option is a deal breaker.  To those people, I ask: what point is there on saving a game that can be beaten in as little as half an hour?","July 18, 2014","true","5.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I like the idea, I like the mix match look to it, but right now there isn't much gameplay to review. Hold off on a purchase until they work out the kinks and whatnot.\n\nBasically what it comes down to is a 15 minute gameplay where you attach some stuff to your ship, maybe destroy another ship, and then get killed by nano clouds. There's no tutorial, it's not easy to pilot, turn or aim (which is mostly by design), and the gameplay isn't really in the game yet.\n\nI would offer at least 3 major changes right out from the get go. As I'm new to the game I'm sure the devs are probably working on it, so this can be taken with that in mind.\n\n1. Allow players to start with a set of different ships, like the statue of liberty head, space shuttle, colony, etc. but something with a basic thruster that can turn, an engineer arm (or whatnot), and some attach points.\n2. Missions - if even a list of little things to follow to get your "habitat" up and running, like attach a generator, or add a gun to protect yourself, either trade with another habitat or attack it and salvage their parts, etc.\n3. Tone down the comic/brightly colored stuff. I like some of the goofy stuff to it, but most of the space junk is out of place and unrealistic. If the game took a more realistic look like slavaging actual space debries like sattelites (like you already can), missles, space stations, etc it would be great. The school busses, ferris wheel, etc are completely out of place. There are some things that kinda fit, like there's an amount of goofy stuff you can deal with like the Statue of Liberty head, but in other cases it makes the game look like junk. But that is my opinion, I can see how others would really like it.\n\nI think I read that the devs are going to (or already do) allow players to make their own space junk. That would be a good idea, cause it would fix #3 for me outright if I could just check a mod site and download someone else making a realistic space junk pack.\n\nAt this time the game isn't really a full enough product to really play so I don't recommend it. I have hopes that a lot of the fixes and such are just down the road, so I remain optimistic about the future of the game.","September 26, 2014","false","1.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Let that soak in for a minute. Habitat is about building a space station called a habitat from space junk floating around Earth. Space junk including the aforementioned Weaponized T-Rex Head, subway cars, tanks, laser cutters, and more is waiting to be combined to turn you habitat into the most badass weaponized platform in space. Once you've got all manner of weaponry, and hopefully some way to control you creation strapped together, there are enemy stations to destroy and deadly nano machine clouds to avoid. Tackling an enemy station can be handled many ways, limited only by ship design and imagination. There are plenty of ready to use weapons waiting to be attached to your habitat, or can go a little less conventional.

I can see where it is interesting to see what kind of a blob you can make. It is one of those time sensitive / creative types though which really dont seem to go well together. I get the need to set up your habitat on the double because it is the end times, but the nano clouds make this more of an inevitable destruction. It's  good for 30 - 40 minutes at a time, but anything after that you're going to be managing too much at once. It is kinda like going to the park as a kid and playing in the sand, then seeing you can make stuff with what is around you, then some asshat kid comes and runs right through what you were doing, you can take it out on that kid or start over, sorta thing. The weight management in zero-g is interesting, and maneurvering the structure and taking care of joints is cool. I would say if they added more consent to the game and trying to either force you to do certain things, or give more prompts when a trigger event comes up would be cool, like when a structure gets split and you have the requirements for 2 habitats. Maybe making it to where you can just have the 1 and a chunk that broke off that you can disassemble and put back together, or click a button and begin a new habitat from the broken off piece, rather than assuming they're two now.\nBut yeah, TL;DR aside, pretty relaxing track that doesnt get on the nerves, weight management and force distribution with make-shift parts makes this easy to come back to, even though theres that fat-kid nano-cloud that comes and ruins the fun.","July 11, 2014","true","2.2"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

But unlike some other early access games, 4gency isn't just going to take your money and never update their game. I recommend you get on board this early access and see just how amazing this game will become.","July 9, 2014","true","0.2"," 30 of 58 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","30","58","0","0"

It's got the apeal of a Sim-style building game, combined with movement and tower-defense aspects that keep it from bogging down the way some Sim builds can bog down. Think Sim plus Civ, in spaaaaace! So far in Early Access, I'm seeing the kinds of things I want to see, and they're done well enough that I look forward to every new release announcement to see what's been added.\n\nI've seen the developers make steady progress during Early Access, adding new ideas and keeping on top of bugs as well. I've run into some weirdness with controls and movement that I hope will be addressed in future updates. The game still needs polish, and they're still trying to balance making the game move too slowly or too fast in the early stages -- I've seen it both ways in different releases. Just lately, each new game takes a little longer than I'd like before it gets interesting. Better too slow than too fast, though.\n\nFull disclosure: I backed this game in Kickstarter and am acquainted with some of the dev team. I'd have tried the game because of those things, but I wouldn't be recommending it unless I thought it was worth your time. It definitely is worth your time.","December 13, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know people are upset about the nano clouds. I figured out the best way to destroy them real easy. build as many engineers as you can till nano clouds get close to your HQ,  when they are close disconnect the 2 Ion boosters and clouds will stop as long as their is nothing connected. once they stop take engineers  and gather mines to put around or directly in front  and as close as you can to the nano clouds. place additional 4 mines centered and in front of the could I.E( second row of mines) once mines are placed around or in front of all three nano clouds reassemble your HQ. clouds will run into mines and blow up. took me a while to figure that out but it does work. There is three screen shots called suicide cloud 1,2, 3 that you can look at to see how to place mines. Hope this helps all those frustrated players and all the new players to come.I have had over 400 hrs of playing this game.

I have played for a few hours and its crashed on me twice. Also, conecting things togther can be very problematic, things wont attach for no apparent reason and I have had habitats just self destruct for adding the wrong piece. I think certain items like the weapons need more nodes to attach too, the way the nodes are now makes items hard to attach where you want them. I like the idea that there are things out in space that you have to protect yourself from, but they need to be farther away from the starting point. I kept getting my habitat the way I like it and it was destroyed before I could arm it. I really feel like this could be a fun game, but it needs more work.","July 9, 2014","false","3.5"," 10 of 35 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","10","35","0","0"
