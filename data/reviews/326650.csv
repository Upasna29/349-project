Unfortunately, all the differences are massive negatives. First up is the fact that you cannot create your own characters...in an RPG. What you see is what you get... but you had better look fast as the torches are on a timer.... a real time timer... in a turn based game. The interface is incredibly clunky and unwieldy.\n\nThe ingame graphics are not bad for this type of game it has to be said but it really is the only positive i can come up with. Monsters attack one at a time... no mobs allowed. Oh and they are also bizarrely proud of their 'Grind' button otherwise known as 'wait for monsters'. Also you cannot use items in combat or change weapons. Ranged weapons are completely useless.\n\nSo its quite pretty but shallow, slow, empty and lacking in character, options and intelligence.

However, I am a huge Turnbased Dungeon Crawler fan since the first Wizardries and Might&Magics, so I ignored the signs and gave it a shot. Unfortunately this game is incredibly weak.\nDISCLAIMER: I only played a bit more than two hours, but judging by everything I witnessed, I can't expect the game would get any better if I continued playing. However, take everything I say with a grain of salt.\n\nLet's begin with the good stuff (And even the pros come with tradeoffs).\nThe opening theme is nice. Too bad you will hear it only once when you start the game. When it stops, there won't be any music unless you restart the game client.\nThe artdirection COULD be nice if the dev's hadn't decided to make every character look exactly the same and paint everything - Walls, floors, HUD, menu - in the same ugly muddy brown-green.\nThe game might have an interesting aspect of resource management: You can't go to the city to stock up on resources, you can't rest, random encounters don't drop stuff, so you have to manage torches, food, hitpoints and spellpoints carefully.And now the bad stuff. I don't even know where to start\nThe story is delivered in textboxes and ultra-lazy. Some mischievous rogues are doing mischief and you take a band of adventurous adventurers to their hideout.\nEven I, as a non-native english speaker notice how shaky the english translation is.\nNo character creation, although that's not even such a big issue in the context of this game because...\n...the character progression system is a joke. Each character has 6 standard attributes and 3 skills. They level up automatically. You can cast spells if your character posesses a spell book.  I have played ♥♥♥♥♥♥ diablo flashgame clones that were more sophisticated.\nThe interface is incredibly clunky. You can move the party with the arrow keys, everything else is mouse driven. And in such an abyssmal way: To load your bow with an arrow, you have to do five specific mouseclicks. And they are not documented, you have to figure it out by yourself.\ncombat is boring. Enemies appear usually in 3 tiles distance. Since your bow NEVER(really!!) hits outside of close combat, you click 3 times on end turn, then they're in melee range. There your frontliners can attack and your backliners can cast/shoot. No special abilities here.\nYou could cast spells on enemies in the distance, they sometimes even hit. The fireball animation for example looks like you throw a tennis ball at your little doggie, and it roughly has the same impact. The good news: This is the only horrible animation in the game. The bad news: This is the only animation in the game.\nWho came up with the incredibly stupid Idea to make a turnbased game, but tie the duration of torches to real-time?\nThe dungeon looks painfully dull. There is one single texture for the walls, and one for the floor, which also is used for the ceiling. Everywhere. Only exception: Doors that lead to empty rooms and staircases that lead to another level that looks exactly the same. Needless to say, there is nothing to explore and nothing interesting to find.\nThere seems to be only one type of encounter per floor (Which you can conveniently trigger anytime with the "Wait for monster" Button). On the first floor, it is a solitary goblin, which is killed quickly but also can hit hard. On the second floor its three goblins and one shaman which will inevitably tear any level 1 characters a new one. So you HAVE to grind levels on the first floor. Now consider this: A goblin yields 20Xp per character. A character needs 1000Xp for level 2. Basic math: You need to kill 50 goblins first. And better do it quick, because torches and real-time, remember?Bugs. Actually, I'm not sure whether I encountered bugs or strange design decisions. These ones seem to be the former:\nIf an enemy kills a frontliner, you have to assign a backliner for the first row. By doing this, it often happens that your complete party skips their turn and the enemy attacks again, possibly insta-gibs the backliner you just sent forward, making you skip another turn.\nWhen a character gets slain, his portrait gets replaced by a skull. If you give him a revive potion later, the skull stays. Considering the quality of the portraits I advocate against fixing this bug.\nNot a bug but a technical issue. The game forces 1600x900 fullscreen. If your resolution is lower it scales down, but if it is higher, it stays 1600x900 borderless window and you can't move or resize it.The Verdict\nI am sorry. But this game is beyond redemption. The best explanation I can come up with is that it is a lazy cashgrab attempt on the Legend of Grimrock bandwagon. The game has nothing going for it, not even any entertaining values that could make up for a Let's play.\nFurthermore this doesn't isn't a project that can be fixed with a few updates. The devs seem to have already taken lots of wrong turns early in the development process and you can't fix bad design from the git-go with a few patches.\nStay away!\n\nIf you're digging the turn-based dungeon-crawler type game, I can reccomend Paper Sorcerer, Lords of Xulima, or maybe Elminage Gothic.","February 13, 2015","false","2.6"," 89 of 93 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","89","93","11","0"

Simply a failure.\nThe game wanna emulate great games like Legend of Grimrock or similar.. but it fails for everything.\n-An RPG in which there is not absolutely any kind of character creation or opportunity to custom them.\n-The plot are exactly ten line of text\n-After these ten line of text you begin to play in a dungeon.. Withouth knowing anything.. You dont know who are two of the four party members and dont know how to play at all.. To equip an item you have to left mouse botton and go on "use" and then drag it on the hand of the character; and if you own many objects of the same kind (like torches) you need to split them before being able to use them.\n-This "game" is just a set of images put togther without sense.. And without ANY kinf of animation..Really nothing! Monsters are seems made of paper\n-About monsters..they are almost only goblin/orcs.. and when you spot them it will take 3/4 turns before they reach you. Paralytic goblins of paper. But if you try to hit them with a bow you ll always miss them.. And you can use just few spells before being withou mana.. So you simply sit and wait for that paralytic goblin to come. Oh yes...one morething about "combats" : enemies will face you one by one.. fat paralytic goblins that cant you two or more at the same time in the tunnel\n-Everyrhing is a problem in this game... Even the doors: I resisted 20 minutes in this game just to understant how they work. You arrive in front of a door and you see a very big lock..you click on it and the game says to you "this door works with this lock" or something similar.. So you spend minutes and minutes to go around all the level for the keys.. But the frustration is the solution: I didnt know if I should crash a book on the screen of my pc, but I just decided to crash the bad face of my character on the door and...I passed!! The solution was walking forward like the door didnt exist! You dont need to open it and when you pass there is no animation.. So why put a door?? I wont say anything more.\n\nPlease, dont waste money on this.\nTry some free to play or real games, but not this.\nThanks for reading,\n-Lonewolf\n\n<< https://www.facebook.com/IlTessitoreDiSogni >>","February 13, 2015","false","1.4"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"

So you have to know to grind to level 2 on wandering monsters to actually progress, and this happens in a few places - there isn't really hard fights in this game, you either win easily or get wiped out, and there is no flee function if you do get in over your head, so save often would be the advice to any but the purist.\n\nYour adventurers are provided to you rather than generated yourself, which normally indicates the predefined characters will have well developed fixed characters/roles which will come out during the game, and thus requiring the player not have flexibility. None of your characters ever speak to each other, only a few interactions with NPCs during special events. The only real advantage then is it means it is faster to get into the game, as in, you start immediately in the dungeon with a formed and equipped party after a one page wall of text intro. You do have a bit of flexibility in that some of your characters start off multiclassed (mage/thief etc.), although once you level up once or twice that option seems to disappear and your choice becomes permanent.\n\nThis attempt to throw you in at the start without any need for setting up doesn't work very well though, as your party is very ill equipped to go adventuring - you are short on torches to light the way, food to eat, potions to heal up/recover mana (only out of combat as you have no inventory access any time monsters are about), etc. Your main fighter has no weapon and starts off attacking monsters with his bare fists unless your archer/mage gives him her dagger. One character has a shield they have left in a backpack while having a hand free to use it.\n\nThe UI is idiosyncratic, you have to nock a first arrow in order to use a bow, which requires splitting a stack to get one and putting it in your offhand. Casting a spell requires dragging upwards from the spell icon. Locked doors tell you they need a key, but in fact the only thing that opens them is the unlock spell, you will never find a key in this dungeon. Changing the marching order requires you to right click one character, then left click the other you want to swap. Unless you immediately go to find a quide of how to play (there is one good guide here on steam that should cover it) you are likely to spend a lot of time being frustrated as the game doesn't help you at all.\n\nThen you have the last and main problem - as noted it has a core of an okay retro-CRPG game. But that is it, it is very bare bones, there aren't any different looking levels, there aren't any puzzles, there are a few NPC encounters through the game but they are very basic text (not even a graphic of the NPC!) with a yes/no option of whether to give them gold/torches/healing potions in exchange for healing/xp (and a couple of achievements). The combat is one dimensional, nearly all mobs are just basic melee with more or less hp/damage. The only exception I can think of is the goblin shaman who curses you (not sure what this does, sometimes I did entire levels with it before casting the cure and it didn't make any obvious difference). There is no story development or plot, you have no choices to make when your characters level up, you have no NPCs/neutrals you can either fight or help for different risks/rewards.\n\nSo there is very little here to recommend it to the vast majority of people. However I did like it a bit myself, as it was a puzzle to be solved of how to actually progress in the game, and given the current £1 price tag for an evenings entertainment for me it was worth it, but I wouldn't recommend it to most people hence the "No" below.","December 31, 2015","false","6.0"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","0"

Wait for a bundle of sime kind where you can get it for few cents. And this is completely reasonable price for it.\n\nThe game itself seems unfinished. Well, you can actually finish it, but mechanics are just terrible. There is no Options in game menu, only thing you will find there is: New adventure, Load, Credits and Save.\nForget about reasonable intro - only one page with cliche story apperas. Yeah, and forget about customizing your party. You are trown to a dungeon immidiately, left to struggle by equiping your party.\nI do have problem with that - I've palyed tuns of grid-base RPGs but those usually came with manual of some kind, where some basics are explained. This manual is a Joke. Few pictures hot to actually do stuff would be nice.\n\nThe only usable keys are arrow keys - forget about WSAD. You can't select hero by number keys, what I find normal in grid-based crawlers. Forget about triggering game menu by ESC. You have to punish your mouse with thousands of meaningles cliks.\n\nIt took me about 20 minutes to figure out, how to use bow in combat and since I've checked, other gamers had the very same problem. Is that a problem to write it to the manual? Or maybe use some intuitive technique how to do it?\n\nAnd what's the matter with the doors? Again, same situation like with the bow (yeah bow, I didn't find any other during the run). Why tere are keyholes? Why on Earth, is there a possibiliy to interact with the keyhole?  You can walk just through it.\n\nWhy there isn't a loot from creatures? I don't find it that important, but it seems to me, thet those keyholes were projected to be used by keys. Maybe keys from some loot? It gives me an impression, that designer were lazy at some point to finish this idea.\n\nWhat about some story? Again, I've played few games without one, but at least it was compesated by game mechanics - puzzles of sime king, different textures on the wall, interaction with NPCs, animation of monsters (and also groups of monsters) or animation of swings during the fight. And again, I have this feeling that at some point designers just resignated to spend more time on the development of the game.\n\nFights are somehow boring, because monsters either kick your donkey badly or you wipe them by two swings. And why? Because you have to literally grind them in the dark corners od dungeons. Otherwise you will get punished badly. This means, you have spent from 10-30 minutes pushing a button: Wait for monster. And it will come! Ant than other, and than other.... So after few hundrets of creeps you are ready to continue you epic journey. And be prepared for encounters. Monsters will appear from nowhere, leaving no loot after killing. Your party will suffer from hunger - but you can feed them bread and apples you will find, or cast a spell thet feed your entire party. And here comes the troube.\n\nYou can't rest/sleep in Candlewind. Therefore do not count with mana regeneration. I find it acceptable, but in connection of random encounters of monsters, you can easily run into a situation, were you will be out of health, mana, you party will be starving and there is nothing, you can do about it. You just lost. There are no hints, how many treasure chest you will find, so you can't plan mana consumption. Yeah, and a lootfrom chest is random...\nDo you need potion of some kind? Forget about it.\n\nI've run across one glitch, when group of monsters was floating in the air, unable to attack me. I was lucky, that i had enough arrows to shoot them down. Ohterwise it would call for alt +f4, because you cant bring up menu during fight. And you cant even open your inventory during hte fight. Run out of mana? Sorry, just wait till a monster will crush all the weak party members.\n\nLast thing. 5th and 6th party member are completely pointles. Only first two heroes can attack by their swords/daggers. All other members have to wait till the end of a fight. Just a magic book can be used and a bow (yeah the 1 vow you have from the very beggining). And a funny thing - as soon I've rescued them, both of theme were dead. But I have interacted with them right before. Creepy, right?\n\nAnd to be fair - there are few thing I liked: The song (yeah, there is no other one), textures on walls, creatures (just animate them!) and the portrait of hero (again the, because it is for the whole party with some slight modifications).\n\nCandlewind is game you should avoid. There are some glitches, mechanics are terrible, dungeons are somehow "empty" and I have an impression, that developers just did a sloppy job of finishing it. Personally, I'll avoid any other game creathed by them.\n\nTLDR tips and spoilers:\n\n- You can use a bow only if you split arrows and put one in your hand.\n- Most of the doors are open - just press the forward key\n- You will regenerat mana when you level up - be prepard for that. Feed our party before you lup\n- Open locked chest by a spell. You can reload a game, if you are not satisfied\n- Take everything you need. Inventory is big enough.\n- Don't read manual. It's pointless.","April 26","false","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaigaKagami10/recommended/326650/","TaigaKagami10","Taiga Kagami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TaigaKagami10/","2354 products in account","This game is an old school RPG where you move your party around with arrow keys through corridors in a dungeon. You encounter enemies in a 1st person view & select actions for each party member such as attack, magic spell, shoot arrow, cast spell and so on. Its decent enough if you find it in a bundle how I did for only $0.30. Reminds me of old-time RPG games and an RPG fan can enjoy it for this cheap price with no worries.\n\nThe graphics are OK, simple drawn art, nothing great but not horrible either. Party members all look the same as if they are brothers/sisters, same hair for everybody as well. Sound is decent with music and effects that do the job.\n\nI would give the game about a 5.5/10, it is better than many indie games I have played, but nothing special. Good for a bundle game IMO.","March 23, 2015","true","0.2"," 7 of 53 people (13%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","13","7","53","3","0"
