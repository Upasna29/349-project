While the games controls are solid and the gameplay functions, its just not the type of game that will keep your interest for too long. Only for those who really need a top-down experience and have nothing else to play.\n\nFor more information and gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf0PcmCNXnE","March 19, 2015","false","1.1"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","18","31","2","0"

The levels are linear and the enemies definitely not the most difficult I've ever seen in a game. However everything works and no bugs make it a nice little game to shoot a bit around in. The story, as seen by the name of your main enemy ;), is not to be taken too seriously with its over the top writing but is at least coherent.\nDon't expect to play it for many hours but in the end for the €0,98 that I picked this up it is well worth its money.","November 26, 2015","true","8.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
