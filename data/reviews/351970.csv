"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imgonnadestroyu/recommended/351970/","imgonnadestroyu","hehah im graduntn fuk u hahahaha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imgonnadestroyu/","115 products in account","You can put a cat on your head.\n\n\nEdit:\nDue to certain induviduals expressing their displeasure with my review, and probably many others as can be seen from one out of every 4 people finding it not helpful in any way, i have decided to expand upon this comment on the game, and give my true opinion.\n\nThis was my first tales game. I have long been a fan of RPGs, mostly in the form of final fantasies, but i have never found the oppurtunity to play from the tales series, mostly due to the lack of them on PC.\n\nWhile this may be common knowledge to some, it will not be to all. To start off, i will talk about the battle system. To be honest, i found it very confusing at first. It's all real time fighting, and everything is based off of combinations of clicks and certain keyboard keys. you use your left click for basic attacks, and your right click for attacks such as special techniques or spells. later, after learning more abilites, you will be able to set certain skills to different combinations of buttons. for instance; right+mouse button = a move, left+mouse button = a different move. when you get the hang of what keys to press for what move, you will have a LOT more fun. It's simply learning the games mechanics. While this takes time, when you learn how, you will have an amazing experience exploiting weaknesses and finding cool technique combos.\n\nCombat summary - difficult at first, but very fun when you learn how to use your techniques well. Doesn't take a lot of time, but be prepared to learn new things. 8.5/10\n\nNow, we come to the equipment and skills it comes with. Each piece of equipment you find in either a chest or an enemy drop will have some ability on it. Examples being; +4% attack, +10% attack against this certain type of enemy, +10 hp gained when blocking, etc. While these may be useful, it does not make or break fights. The certain item you get is far more important, leaving the little perks it comes with to be fairly insignificant. You can also fuse two of the same items together, allowing the new item to be everr so slightly stronger, and with perhaps new abilites. I went through the entire game without fusing a single piece of equipment or trying to find the best setup of abilites. The ONLY time i needed to make custom gear with lots of fusing was for the most difficult, optional, and final boss. Also, it's confusing as ♥♥♥♥. Here's an example of what you can get if you spend 10 hours farming for specific equipment.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=586438763\n\n\nEquipment/fusing summary - interesting, but too confusing to pay attention to. Can easily go through the game without having to worry about it. Unless you're a min-maxer, don't worry about fusion unless you really want to. 6/10\n\nFinally, the story and characters. I've heard many complaints about the characters, and how it's difficult to be attached to them. I, on the other hand, absolutely love them. This may be because i have little experience in the tales games, but i found the main protagonist to be a perfect fit. Naive, courageous, a little innocent, and an incredibly strong willed induvidual. While i don't like some as much as others, there is a lot of variety among the group. you'll get a lot of good laughs with certain interactions and side conversations, while also feeling quite emotional at points. I'm keeping this vague because i would like to keep this review as spoiler free as possible. Which is why, with the story explanation, i will keep it short. I very much enjoyed the story. While the pacing seemed a little weird at times, and some things were a bit rushed, hard to follow, and sometimes never even explained, it was largely unnoticeable due to the large amount of positives you'll find throughout your journey. If you read all of the dialogue (no skipping please), you'll find the storyline very interesting with some very unique concepts.\n\nStoryline/characters summary - against popular opinion, i found the characters to be very funny and easy to get attached to. While the story is a little rushed at times, it's overall a very cool experience. Don't skip the dialogues. 8.5/10\n\n\nWould i recommend this game to a friend? Of course. Would i recommend this game to everyone who is even a little interested? Of course. As long as you're willing to put a bit of time and effort into learning the mechanics, and have previously had an RPG or JRPG that you have played and enjoyed, this is a must have.\n\nAlso, you can put a cat on your head. :3 Love the costumes. Love cats.\n\nAnd you can do this\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=592402361\n\nAnd this\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=592402153","December 17, 2015","true","121.2"," 715 of 901 people (79%) found this review helpful 549 people found this review funny","79","715","901","549","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmb1988/recommended/351970/","prmb1988","Gepetto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmb1988/","195 products in account","This is a great game for JRPG fans. This is NOT good for casual gamers. If you're already familiar with the "Tales of" series, you know exactly what you're getting into. For those of you who only know Tales of Symphonia, this game is very similar, with a very improved combat system, and a bit shorter. If you liked other entries in the series, you'll probably enjoy this one as well. It's a little bit more complicated than the others, though. If you like JRPGs and aren't familiar with Tales games, this is a good place to start.\n\nFun: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nAudio: 10/10\nReplay Value: There's a New Game+ option with extra difficulty modes and other options that you can change from one playthrough to another, so if you're a completionist, you might want to replay up to 3 or even 5 times. There's also a DLC chapter focusing on a minor character. 10/10\n\nLet's get this out of the way first: Tales of Zestiria is a JRPG, but it does not have turn-based combat and is not a grindy game. In fact, your characters' levels matter much less than what equipment they use and how you control them in the real-time battles, both of which are based on some systems that are difficult to understand at first and brushed a lot of people the wrong way (see below for an overview). The lack of a need to grind, the presence of a good Quick Travel system and the lack of needlessly big, empty regions (except for one) mean that the game flows very well, and except for a single bit near the end which doesn't even take 15 minutes total to clear, it never feels like battles and simple puzzles are being tossed at you just to increase play time, as it often does with so many other games of the genre.\n\nThe game's localization was very well-done. One particular character has a thing for puns and "dad jokes", which are very hard to localize because often they can't be translated and you have to come up with a new one along the same lines. The English versions of those might be one of my favorite parts of the game. The English voice acting is also very good for the most part. I don't know Japanese, so I can't compare, but the English language audio and text are on point.\n\nThe story is nothing exceptional, but good enough and well-told. The soundtrack is really good.The game world is immersive, there are interesting NPCs and sidequests, and I had fun just going out to explore places instead of actually following the story on several occasions. A big part of the game are the correlated Skills and Fusion systems, which I enjoyed playing around with, but which also frustrated many people. I'll get into those below.\n\nThere's an unofficial patch that allows the game to run at 60fps if you care about that sort of thing.\n\nSPECIFICS\nAs I mentioned, character levels aren't as important in Tales of Zestiria as they are in the average JRPG. It's possible to take down an enemy twice your level or to be defeated by an enemy half your level, all depending on how you fight and on what equipment you have. Equipment stat boosts are much larger than your stat growth when you level up, but even more important than that are the Skills that your equipment comes with. Two otherwise identical weapons that happened to drop with different Skills on them can be significantly different from each other, depending on what other equipment you're wearing. In the beginning of the game, Skills aren't that important, but as the game progresses, they become more and more relevant. Certain bosses simply can't be beaten if you don't have the right Skills equipped.\n\nTHE BATTLE SYSTEM\nWhen you encounter an enemy, a wide circular area will be closed around you to form the field of battle. You can move around freely,dodge, block, attack and defend in real time, and issue generic commands to the party members you're not controlling directly (spread out, focus on the same enemy, focus on attacking, focus on defense). By pausing the battle, you can enter a menu and order any non-controlled character to use a specific "arte" (the game's name for attacks, special moves and magic). You can also change which character you control mid-battle. There are five elements (Void/Non-Elemental, Fire, Earth, Water and Wind) to which enemies can be weak, neutral or resistant. In addition, each element is associated to a status ailment (e.g. Water to Poison) and a character stat (e.g. Void to Attack). Every single arte you use will have one or more elements, and every arte of a given element has the potential to cause the respective element's status ailment or give you a buff to the corresponding stat when used. Enemies also have Types (e.g. Flying, Armored, Beast) against which certain attacks are strong. An attack that's strong against an enemy type will deal bonus damage even if that enemy is strong against the attack's element. There are three numbers to keep an eye on during battle: your HP, your SC (Spirit Chain) and your BG (Blast Gauge). BG is used for certain especially powerful artes and for a unique mechanic called Armatization. SC is what you use for actually fighting. Your maximum SC is always 100 and everything you do in battle except running and blocking costs some SC. SC recovers over time during the battle, but if you attack too quickly or too often, you'll run out and have to wait. The lower your SC goes, the slower it recovers.\n\nSKILLS\nEach character has five different equipment slots, and each piece of equipment has four Skill slots. There are a total of 50 different Skills that can give you anything from stat boosts to increased HP recovery, protection against an element or status ailment, added damage against certain enemies, etc.  These Skills are organized into a 5x10 grid where each of the 5 lines corresponds to an element and each of the 10 collumns corresponds to a theme (e.g. the first collumn is stat boosts, the 9th collumn is increased damage of the respective types). Every Skill from currently equipped gear will be active on that character's Skill Chart.\n\nSkills can be combined for added bonus effects, which can be even more dramatic than the basic Skills themselves (such as reflecting 30% of all damage of a particular element, having an extra Blast Gauge or gaining a 20% Max HP increase). The Bonus Skills depend on where skills are on the 5x10 Skills chart. There are three types of Bonus Skills: Stack (multiple copies of the same Skill), E-Union (two or more adjacent skills in the same horizontal line) and G-Union (all five Skills on the same collumn). Equipping two of the same skill, for instance, reduces the time you spend staggered by 6%. If you have multiple stacks of two, their effects add up - a stack of stacks, if you will. This means you can become completely immune to certain status ailments by equipping the right skills.\n\nFUSION\nEvery piece of equipment you get will have at least one skill and up to four. In weapon shops, it's possible to fuse two pieces of equipment and combine their skills, while also improving the equipment's stats with each fusion. Slots that have the same skill in both fused weapons, or any skill in one weapon and a blank slot in the other will keep that same skill in the resulting fused weapon. Slots that are empty in both weapons will continue empty. Slots that have different skills in each weapon will end up with a third skill that is different from both. Because of this mechanism, through fusion you can create equipments with the Skill set you want, to match your play style or enable a specific strategy against a particular foe.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf the above description of game mechanics didn't scare you, and you enjoy JRPGs, you'll probably enjoy Tales of Zestiria. If not, then you've probably stopped reading already anyway, but don't buy the game. That is all.","November 24, 2015","true","130.5"," 157 of 178 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","157","178","11","0"

There is no need to defend yourself against me. If you have a differing opinion on the game, I encourage you to write a review of your own. I do NOT encourage you to leave nasty comments and/or personal attacks on this review (nor does the Steam SA). You're welcome to disagree with my opinion, but please be civil and decent.\nFirst of all a lot of the Tales combat will feel very familiar. Characters have regular attacks, special moves called Artes, and magical spells. Regular attacks and Artes can be chained together while magical spells require charge time, so the caster must be protected from enemies who want to interrupt their spells. The CC system appears to have been replaced by something called the Spirit Chain system, which looks like a mix of TP and CC. You spend SC to use Artes, and they replenish as you attack. As with CC, precisely timed side-steps, blocks or dodges can fill the SC gauge.\n\nOne of the more interesting elements of the game is Armatization, a super-powered combat mode that is similar to the Chromatus in Tales of Xillia 2. Armatization requires Sorey and one of the Seraphim (Team Members). Each of Sorey's Seraphim pals is tied to a specific element, and when Sorey uses Armatization, he fuses with them to gain access to new moves and weapons based on their element. For example, Mikelo provides a bow and magic-based arts while Edna gives giant stone fists and earth-based arts. Instead of the traditional Tales character swapping (Like in tales of Symphonia for example), there is a focus on different fusions to change Sorey's play style.\n\nWhen you hit an enemy's elemental weakness or elemental resistance, the game displays a big glowing icon to notify you. This also makes me suspect that enemies can swap resistances on the fly, requiring Sorey to do the same.\n\nThe dungeon exploration in Zestiria feels very familiar. You'll probably have a good idea of what to expect if you've played recent games in the franchise. This game lacks any sort of puzzles in the dungeons, similarly to Xillia. So, for anyone hoping to a return to dungeon puzzles like Symphonia, will once again be disappointed. However, the dungeons are spacious and well suited to the game’s “Real Map Battles” system.\n\nTales of Zestiria doesn't look to reinvent the wheel. The core Tales combat system that people know and love is still there, and while there have been some changes to the basic design, longtime fans will still enjoy the game. There are some new features, such as the Armatization fusion mechanic and the new on-field battle camera, to keep the game feeling fresh, and the story is hella intriguing.\n\nThere are two last things to call attention  to before closing this review out. First, the cutscenes. Every scene with dialogue in Zestiria is actually more like a cutscene. Text bubbles have been removed in favor of the text showing up on the bottom of the screen like subtitles, and the entire scene has motion and acting to it. However, even with that all being the case, you can still press buttons to skip through lines quickly. It’s really implemented incredibly well!\n\nSecond, are the anime cutscenes. Ufotable handles all of the animation for the game, including the cutscenes (of which there are surprisingly many that are animated) and the opening sequence. Every single bit of animation that Ufotable handled in the game looks stunning and absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI'd DEFINITELY recommend it if you are an Tales of fan or newcomer!, unless you find yourself allergic to the typical trappings of such games (you can see the typical zomg 30 fps outrage on the forums already). But it’s still a Tales of game… isn’t it?","October 19, 2015","true","50.0"," 442 of 592 people (75%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","75","442","592","39","31"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alqairu/recommended/351970/","alqairu","OVERWATCH > ST3AM GAMES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alqairu/","89 products in account","I'm a veteran of the tales series and I'm a bit torn about Zestiria.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Combat is GREAT.  Might be the most satisfying combat in a tales game yet.  Every boss has a different feel and you have to constantly change up your combos, characters, and tactics to suit the enemy.  Very rarely do any two bosses feel the same.\n\n-The gear system is non-linear.  At first I was skeptical, but this ended up being a lot of fun.  It offers tons of customizations to suit your playstyle.  I could write an entire review on how great the gear system is in Zestiria.\n\n-The game doesn't feel 'grindy' and encounters occur instantly and in the actual environment instead of teleporting you to a seperate battle scene.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Story.  Tales games are known for aweome stories, memorable characters, and massive plot twists.  Zestiria's story is "You are the chosen one.  Bad dude is doing bad things.  Assemble team of one-dimensional RPG stereotypes.  Go beat up bad dude to stop him from doing bad things."  I've never finished a tales game and felt so dissatisfied with the story\n\n-Camera.  You'll get used to it quickly if you're a veteran gamer, but it can be VERY frustrating in many cases.  The benefit to the old encounter system was that your camera was never in your way and the entirety of the battle was always onscreen.  With the new one, the camera can be obscured and the way it focuses, even when there are no obstacles, sometimes places the camera in FRONT of your character so that you cannot even see what you are doing.\n\n-Silliness.  This sounds weird, I know.  Tales games always have some tongue-in-cheek humor, but it's usually in appropriate places, like optional skits and cosmetic item descriptions.  This one is plagued by it.  Your battlefield sounds like a 9gag meetup as your characters shout out a constant stream of memes and pop culture references and even the skits and main story scenes are sometimes filled with them.  I'm all for humor in a game, but Zestiria takes it to the point where it makes the serious part of the story harder to enjoy.  (And it was hard to enjoy to begin with.)\n\nOverall, I recommend Zestiria, it's still a fun ARPG from a team that makes some damn good ARPGs.  If you're looking for a tales game and the combat is all you care about, then you've found the one.  Bonus points if you giggle at doge jokes, you will be right at home.  However, it is not the most solid entry in the series story-wise.  If you have the appropriate console and have never played them, Tales of Symphonia, Tales of Xilia, or Tales of Xilia 2 will, in my opinion, give you a far more satisfying story experience while still having some great combat.","November 1, 2015","true","55.3"," 99 of 113 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","99","113","9","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/michal_sivek/recommended/351970/","michal_sivek","Sivek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/michal_sivek/","1402 products in account","Kind of a mixed-bag where your enjoyment of this will come down to how much you like the combat and the character interactions.  I found both enjoyable enough to overcome most of the game's flaws.\n\nFirst off, the port is really good.  There are arbitrary resolution options, easy and well-done keybinding, instant switching of button prompts upon switching from keyboard to game controller, graphic options and I didn't suffer one crash while playing Zestiria or experience any kind of framerate issues.  The UI is solid and doesn't have any glaring issues. This is a very pleasant surprise for a Japanese series's PC debut.\n\nZestiria also has a lot of small touches that make it easy to play.  For example, you can save anywhere.  The game calls it a quick save, but it's a permanent save you can use anywhere and doesn't delete after loading it.  You can also line-skip dialogue and cutscenes, which is great for fast readers and for when you just want to hurry along a cutscene without just straight-skipping it.  If you die against a boss, you can just retry the fight immediately after being given a chance to rearrange your equipment/party instead of having to load a save and make a run back to the boss.  Another big thing with Zestiria is you get a bunch of dumb costume accessories that have a ton of editing possibilities and all costume changes are reflected in-game.  This is always a cool thing.  All this adds up to a hassle-free experience and I give the dev team a lot of credit for these features.\n\nYou'll spend a ton of time in combat, so let's talk about that a bit.  Zestiria decided to have battles not transition to an imaginary plane but instead take place in the current environment.  Honestly, I don't really see the advantage to this gameplay-wise, other than as a testing phase for future implementation,  It makes getting a feel for the whole battlefield practically impossible and also can cause the camera to spaz out at times.  While I didn't find the battle camera to be as problematic as most (like 90% of the time it was a non-factor), there will be times when it gets caught on a corner or you get too close to an enemy and it just starts to wig out.  Other than that, the game uses a pairing system called armatization that lets you combine characters, mainly to exploit elemental weaknesses, which are a big thing in Zestiria.  Bosses can be problematic though, as they tend to get incredibly aggressive when weakened and it's extremely likely you'll get a full-party wipe in a matter of seconds a number of times.  I liked the combat and found it mostly satisfying with the above issues plaguing it a bit.\n\nThe character interactions are one of the main draws of the series and it's really good here.  The skits and humor are mostly well-translated, particularly all the puns.  At times the translation gets a bit too meme-y♥♥♥♥♥♥encey at times but on average, it's a very good adaptation.  The biggest problem character-wise is that non-party members might as well be non-existent and don't do anything to make you care much about them.\n\nThe story is bad, and this is coming in with low expectations for it.  The first two-thirds are kind of boringly generic, but not really holding the game back or anything, then the last third of the game comes and suddenly there's a huge emphasis on the story and it's just bad and there's a lot of it.  Even things like quest design start to fall apart, like there are numerous times where the game sends you to some place, only to arrive there and then immediately be told to leave and go someone else.  The home stretch of the game also arbitrary locks some fast-traveling locations so you end up just trying to power through it to get back to killing stuff and doing sidequests.\n\nDungeon and music is uneven.  The parts of Zestiria that feel fully cooked, like the entire middle section of the game, have some decent design, like the shrines for example, and really cool, uninterrupted music.  Other areas, like most random ruins and transitional areas, are rather copy/paste with unmemorable tracks.  The team really dropped the ball by not having Sorey's theme be the generic overworld music because it rules and is insanely underused in the game.\n\nThe last negative is the equipment system, which is terrible unless you love micromanaging between a bunch of screens.  They tried to reinvent the wheel here and just messed up.  I won't bother to explain how poor the implementation of it is, but thankfully you can largely ignore it as long as you're playing on the higher difficulties.\n\nAll in all, if you're interested in JRPG's for the PC, this is a pretty solid choice, especially considering how slim the pickings are.  Yeah, it's about 15 hours too long and the story and equipment system are poor, but ultimately I found it a fun game to play, especially once you get your primary party, all the way through the shrine trials.  There's a lot of replayability here due to how the series handles new game+ features, as well.  So if you're looking for a combat and character-oriented JRPG, Zestiria is probably one of your best bets on PC.","November 7, 2015","true","66.2"," 76 of 86 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","76","86","9","0"

Good job!"\n\nCons\nArtes aren't as in depth as the other Tales games\nSome of the characters feel a bit off and impersonal for me, which ruins the atmosphere.\nNot selling the Soundtrack on steam (Yet)\nTaking out the JP song, issues or not, was still fantastic\nA bit confusing with all the added "things" to fights.\n"Auto" mode (fighting) is fantastic until it comes to a *boss* or *Main mob fight* and it's like it goes stupid.\n\n\nRight now, I can in good faith recommend this game AT it's current price to someone whose interested. I am no where near finished and have spent a bunch of hours running around and checking every nook and cranny trying to find chests, herbs, ect. If you're new to the Tales series, it's a nice place to start. It IS different in degree of difficulty and direction then the others, but for a PC starter, it's perfect in difficulty, exploration and story.\n","October 24, 2015","true","32.0"," 76 of 88 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","76","88","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/recommended/351970/","sarysa","sarysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/","177 products in account","Here's my SPOILER FREE binge review.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the series, Tales (of) games tend to be heavily story loaded throughout the entire game. The newer games easily have 5 hours of main story dialogue at a minimum, and Tales of Zestiria likely continues this tradition. They all feature some variant of the original Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS) which is where primary combat occurs on a straight line, with moves resembling a beat-em up or fighting game. Aside from an early game or two, Tales games also pioneered optional bits of dialogue called "skits", used to flesh out the world or characters, though sometimes used for tutorial purposes. Stories tend to vary from game to game and are always on an epic scale. These are all core tenets of what makes a Tales game.\n\nOf course, since the quality of the port is what most people reading this will care about, I'll start with that. Out of 51 hours of gameplay, the port's quality is pretty strong. The most important aspect is that the game never once crashed -- something TF2 couldn't even claim given the extremely long individual play sessions. Like anything that dares to be 3D on the PC, there are spotted reports of folks having problems, but on an Nvidia 670 with 6 month old drivers, no problem. Keyboard and mouse are fully supported, and both gameplay and wandering the world are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. The menus are also proper keyboard and mouse menus, but they're still ironing out some glitches. (a day one patch fixed some "last menu option can't be clicked" bugs, but there are other harmless but annoying glitches)\nOh, and you can opt to play with Japanese audio, or you can go with the English audio. I have nothing against the english VA's, but some people just love to have the option.\n\nThe story is somewhat run-of-the-mill to be honest. It's not bad by any means, but it lacks the twists and gut punches of many predecessors, especially games like Tales of the Abyss. You're straight up the hero who's saving the world. However, they do take a refreshing take on what would otherwise be a carbon copy plot -- Tales games tend to use humor, characterization, philosophy, fictional history, and fictional geopolitics to good effect, and Zestiria continues this tradition in a way that better lets the player empathize with this classic saintly hero. I do hope that Namco Tales Studio does give us another Abyss-level story in the future, though. The characters are...weird. If you're a fan of anime, you'll recognize many of the tropes and archetypes. The two playable female humans seem to stand out the most, while the rest are fairly formula. (with one almost seeming like a Persona ripoff)\n\nGameplay is where Zestiria shines -- perhaps even above all of its predecessors. This is coming from a reviewer whose last series game was Tales of Vesperia, but the LMBS changes could end up being a love-hate. Whereas older titles typically had you moving left and right, with 3D titles allowing free run, Zestiria has you running forwards and backwards. The two primary movement keys are even W and S instead of A and D, which I'm sure Symphonia will use. You can still free run, but they've added the ability to sidestep around enemies with the unused movement keys. These controls actually do seem to be an improvement, and is a smooth way to dodge enemy attacks and navigate the battlefield. Speaking of battlefield, having battles take place on the map is a pretty fun improvement. You can fight out on the open, or you can lure enemies into a corner or hallway and annihilate them with your team's AOEs. The movesets for both players and enemies are enormous, with many dedicated standard attacks joining the traditional artes and mystic artes. The game's difficulty curve is pretty smooth, and boy does it get hard. There's so much complexity and depth to the battle system that tutorial monuments litter much of the game, and tutorial messages will overwhelm you in the first 5 hours of play. That said, the game is still beatable without knowing even half of that's going on -- but you'll need all that info to master it.\n\nIt's worth noting that the nature of gameplay is pretty limiting in terms of what the writers could do with the plot. They refreshingly managed to make it so every playable character matters (especially on the overworld), and swapping out the Seraphs during a single battle is a core aspect of gameplay. You won't have to worry much about characters running off with your good gear, but the focused gameplay design probably made the story suffer.\n\nZestiria suffers in the graphics department, but I'm easily willing to forgive this one. The characters and towns look pretty good, the fields and dungeons -- not so much. Some of the dungeons look like they were mapped in a 2D editor and generated from said mapping, while the fields' textures are two generations old. That said, the series is the #3 RPG series in Japan and I can't imagine each game having what we currently consider a modern AAA budget. So what did they do? Pile most of the effort onto the gameplay, much on the story and characters, while the graphics are just there. If you can't look past this, though, it's not the game for you.\n\nAll said and done, it's a solid entry that probably wouldn't end up on many top 3 lists for the series. It sets a good PC precedent for port quality -- good job to the folks who managed said port and keep up the good work. With strong music and gameplay, solid story, and touch-and-go graphics, it's still an enjoyable Tales game, and hopefully the first of many ports to come.","October 22, 2015","true","142.2"," 87 of 105 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","87","105","4","1"

Expect to fight a lot of monsters, just about all the time.\nCharacters constantly talk in battle. It can become more noise than wanted, but can be turned off.\nUpgrading equipment can be convoluted, as it technically may not be as simple as buying new equipment in town stores.\nThe camera in battle can get caught in places at times that obscure your view of the battle.\nThere is a lot of optional treasure to be found through exploration, but none of it is crucial or immediately game-breaking.\nThe game's battle difficulty can be adjusted via in-game menus.\nThis game is very anime. By that, I mean the characters are at times very hammy or just act weird for those lacking context.\nOpinions:Firstly, anything blanked out spoils the story and not the gameplay. As this is a JRPG, the story is the motivation for the gameplay. The story starts out simple and cliche, focusing on helping Angels fight off a Ever-Present-Evil and Monster Army, but it does develop into something more. However, the story tends to leave lingering sentiments that left me unfulfilled. Constant vagueness and intentional crypic nonsense from certain characters wore thin quickly, and the jokes character makes regarding such defuse anything potentially dramatic. Questions are posed, and then left either lingering or are simply taken as is despite whatever notion of doubt I felt or saw in characters.\n\nSuffice to say, the main character resolving to save the big bad by doing what he has been doing for the whole game: hit him with a sword made of angels, left me very underwhelmed when I thought that was the heroic resolve climax. I expected something more personal, rebellious, and ridiculing of the Seraphim that have esscentially been using the main character without explaining the whole situation.\n\nWithout spoiling directly, the game's story attempts to subvert cliche by being vague (for reasons that make sense in the game) and while I could understand why they acted in such a way, it was not entertaining.\n\nThe whole reason the bid bad exsists is because of human folly, but angels allowed it to happen despite knowing it could. They demand worship to push back Evilness, but remain aloof and hidden despite the obvious mutual benefit. While the game shows how blind zealous worship can be as bad as greed/selfishness, there is a lack of passion to it and it all became muted. The angels' passive aggresive attitude toward humans, and the main character in general, had me frusterated to the point of wondering how blindingly trusting the main character is to these people. Friends that intentionally hide and with-hold information so he can learn and decide things for himself... while being the only ones to provide him the means to fight monsters and the big bad.\n\nThey let themselves be used as tools, and use the main character as a tool. I do not understand how such trust could persist in such relationships, but they all fall in line with it.\n\nThere is a distinct emotional wall between characters, and the situation this creates in this universe may be lost on people without heavy RPG context.\n\nConclusionI recommend this game for its combat, which is simple enough to get into and there are complexities to master. But such complexities aren't needed to complete the game. The game is made in such a way that battles can be made more difficult to satisfy needs for challenge. Equipment is not hard to gain, but does take time. You're never expected to invest more than you wish to in gaining said equipment.\n\nThe story has strong characters, though I have mixed feelings about the story. With a game like this, it comes down to personal opinion. That in itself is worth reccomending, if you are willing to think deeply about what is typically taken for granted or ignored in games regarding religion and long-lived beings like elves.","December 3, 2015","true","39.4"," 71 of 86 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","71","86","6","2"

The amount of skits is also nothing close to small and they are pretty interesting to see, I often resorted to just listen to them instead of playing.\n-Animation: even with the casual hate for 30fps the game has a great animation you wont even think you are playing at 30fps, the technology behind the game make everything very vivid and inmmersive for an anime looking JRPG.\n-Soundtrack: the music behind the game is astonishing mainly the music from certain dungeons and the song RIsing Up inspired me so much that I have them with me all the time.\n-Story: the history is pretty much inspired in the good vs the bad, its nothing new in the genre however the way of telling is what is different in a world when only a few ones can see the Seraphim race, the telling of the Sheperd becomes a more related one to the tales of Don Quixote de la Mancha, where the Sheperd is fighting a giant golem and everyone sees simply a rock, funny and yet makes you think what lies beyond the common eyes.\n-Tons of quests and customization: from the equipment to fashion, from simple quests to quests that can customize the very influence you have in certain areas of the map that will affect not only the enemies you fight but the rewards you will get.\n\nCONS:\n-Combat: even if the combat is going in a good direction is not one without flaws, the 3rd person camera becomes almost a 1st person one when combating in narrow spaces or when the back of the player is against a big object. Also the camera being so close to the character makes it really difficult to observe your surroundings, a fix is using the Free Run abililty however since it disabled the SC recovery its a double edge sword.\n-Story: even if the telling is amazing the main bone of it is very basic compared to other Tales of games, mainly compared to the next entry in the PC realm, Symphonia, its not bad but for the first entry as an open world is lack lustered, not many inspirational moments will be found in this game.\n-Skill/Fuse interface: the whole game interface is really good however the other side of the coin is when you are going to fuse an equipment it becomes a pain to distinguish how it will affect your equipment skills (which are tremendously important in the game, if you dont keep them checked you are going down), I ended up leaving the fuse window to check which skills I was going to get and back again to check which fusion will benefit me the most, a pain certainly.\n-Open Empty World: even if the world is wide open and big, the empty spaces between enemies is pretty big so sometimes it feels like a very empty world, dont be discouraged by this but be prepared by it.\n-Sorey is your only character outside the map. You wont change it, its a minor thing but since in the other games you could change them I feel like a backstep when I discovered this.\n\nMIXED\n-Party Setup: the party is stucked at the two humans characters meaning you wont move them from the party, the only thing you can customize is the initial seraphims that will start the battle with you, fortunately this can be changed at any point even during battle with ease. This also is influenced by the story of the game, thats why its a mixed opinion. I didnt liked it at first but seeing how the story unfolded I understood it has to be done.\n\nDLC\n*SPOILER ALERT REGARDING ALISHA*\n-Alishas Story DLC: many think this was bad since Alisha should be a permanent character in the main game, but as with the mixed opinion I had with the party setup Alishas Story is also mixed, I think it Alisha should have stayed in the main game however the story unfolded so well I didnt see a problem with her separating from the main cast. This DLC made me realize it was a brave move and I support it fully.\n*END OF SPOILERS*\n\n-Costumes: all the costumes are amazing and hilarious, they are unneeded and they do not affect your gameplay but after playing for many hours you wish you could change your characters a few things here and there, costumes are for that. There are some unlockables in the game but most of them will appear as future DLC, so get your card ready ;)\n-Free Skits: get this DLC its full of funny skits that will make you laugh a lot! HOWEVER! Listen to this Skits only and ONLY when you have finished both the main game and Alishas Story DLC so you wont be spoiled of some elements of the story and characters.\n\nTIME TO FINISH IT: Straight forward 30hrs, with side quests and extra dungeons: over 65hrs\nGAME RATED: 75~80/100 = GREAT\nRECOMMENDED: YES!\nBEST IN THE SERIES? Nope, but its the first being an open world so its understandable that the transition will take its toll somewhere.","November 10, 2015","true","83.5"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","53","59","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lmotaku/recommended/351970/","lmotaku","Yuhirou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lmotaku/","458 products in account","When reviewing this title, I tried to stay as objective as possible, knowing that I'm a fan of two other Tales of titles. Of course, I will end up having a few subjective opinions about the game, but I will try to break down and separate it in a way that allows someone interested in reading the facts vs feelings towards the game.\n\n[Graphics]\n(Objective) The game is utilizing the same engine Xillia used, and at first due to being a PC player, as well as console, I found the graphics to be "Okay." Not truly amazing, but not terrible, either.\nIn the first few areas there is not all that much to look at except ruin/town textures and plains.\nHowever, as you progress from Lady of the lake, things start to look less and less plain until they have too many textures, and some flowers appear to be flat in-game and aren't 3D.\n\n(Subjective) Walking around seems to be fairly slow, coming from Tales of Symphonia/Vesperia, but it might have something to do with the size of the world.\nI couldn't help but feel like I was being limited in some form or another, though. (Later you get a boost from one of your Seraphim, anyway.)\n\n[Items, Weapons, and Boons]\n(Objective)\nThere are tons of customization options, bonuses and more in the game.\nFusion enhances the level of an item, and you can link/stack unison skills and what not, giving your equipment unlockable skills, damage bonuses and more.\nBoons can be set with the Lord of the Land (Completing the story unlocks this for different regions.) You can get things like\nenemy detection, improved healing, replenishing chests, and more!\nLater you unlock something that helps the Lord of the land and you get even more bonuses. (They can also be used on items! You'll see. )\n\n[Battle mechanics]\n(Objective)\nYou have a power (like mana) known as SC. When the blue bar charges you have a choice of using mystic arts and martial arts and your Seraphim companions get Seraphim arts.\nIn larger battles with say 5+ enemies, there is a noticeable chug when monsters spawn, but other than that and the camera going crazy sometimes if\nyou're stuck near a wall, it's very thought out and your equipment really makes a difference more than levels.\n\n(Subjective)\nIt's fun, but feels slow and doesn't represent the damage numbers in a nice way. It'll show your whole combo damage, but not singular hits during a combo.\nI think they would have been better to use a two number display system. Grey to the lower parts and sides of the mob's sprite/texture and total damage overhead.\nThe titling of things seems off, too. Instead of "Blocking/Defense" it says "Restrain." Which, sure, by literal definition it makes sense, but I was more like "Am I restraining it, wtf is going on here?"\nIt may have been a screw up with the group that did the localization on the game. It's fine.. I'm probably knitpicking, but they should just have "Blocking" and "Hitting" rather than "Restrain" and "Power Hit."\n\nAlso, in previous titles it was just guard, guard break, and damage. ie: Shows blocking animation on character, shows reduced or 0 damage. Breaking guard showed a text/animation in the sprite and then hits got through white and bigger/pow area around text when criticals got through.\nI believe ToS and Vesperia is better than the way they did it in ToZ. I still enjoy ToS' battle system immensely, but I also enjoy the new mechanics, just not the way it's represented.\n\n\n[Story]\n(Objective)\nIt's mostly a rehash of other stories, where you have to go about unlocking trials of power(whether it's seprahim, flow of mana(summoning with Sheena from ToS), or whatever)\nThe characters are kinda different, but ultimately it's the same thing. "Reunite the world, vanquish evil, get two races living in harmony again." The archtypes and symbolic of many anime tropes, but I feel Sorey and Edna are a bit different, sure Edna is kinda a trope, too.. but >_<\n\n\n(Subjective)\nI love Edna! xD\n\nThere are many different things to like about the characters, even if it is a rehash. There are a hell of a lot of skits to enjoy, some giving you bonuses.\nThe characters are as friendly as you expect them to be, and I caught myself laughing quite a few times, so it's done it's job at entertaining me.\nThe love of ruins and archeology has been passed from Raine to Sorey, but the goals of Lloyd. Sorey is an okay character. Not someone you can hate or love.\nRelationships of the characters seem pretty normal for this sort of story, but there is a lack of I don't know.. love or admiration?\nSure, there are a few moments where they show that they like a character's methods of thinking, or one being a protector of the other, and a friendly competition between two, but\nutimately I feel no quintessential love between two characters like Lloyd and Colette for example.\n\nMaybe I'm just looking to save everyone/the damsel again? Damn it Dezel, you took my glory from me!\n\nAnyway, they all have a story, they all have a place, and it makes it fun for a JRPG/Anime fan. Although, I won't beat around the bush, I will say how it is:\n\nThere may be one or two fresh feeling characters, but ultimately the tropes force be strong.\n\n[Museks]\nMusic is purely subjective, and I have found a few passable and loveable tracks, namely the earth trial and wind trial BGMs.\nExamples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9GVQjKI_QM & https://youtu.be/PwXRtGeFELA\n\n\n[Battles/Difficulty]\nFor the most part, normal and moderate are fairly easy to cope with if you've played JRPG titles before. Focus on items, finding herbs, beating region bosses that give you orbs that stack up to give bonus HP to the entire party. EXP/Levels increase AP, unlock artes, but ultimately don't do what item proficiency, bonuses, and stronger item links do!\n\n[Puzzles]\nThis is another purely subjective one. I felt that it was very easy to get through every single trial and puzzle thus far. I beat almost every trial, except water and wind(Due to confusing myself xD)in less than 10-20 minutes. Now, of course the puzzles could be more difficult for others, but it felt they were very simple, where I remember much better puzzles in earlier titles! Test me Namco-Bandai senpai! :P\n\n[Other battle stuff]\n(Objective) There are a few battle types in the game. You can get mobs that chase you to stack to proc more difficult encounters, and dangerous encounters have a random chance.\nThese battles are only somewhat more difficult than normal battles, just because there are a lot of creatures to watch. This is where items and party control is necessary, but not always.\n\n(Subjective)\nNot really all that difficult in any sense. Weaknesses, strengths, stop artes casters, gg.\n\nThe only time that it gets hairy is when something is 50% or higher than my level, because they kill the AI no matter how they're set instantly. I preferred the AI in ToS. If I tell them to be defensive, they don't stop blocking and I can go directly to their abilities and cast them or take over ALL of them easily and play them how I want if needed. I could be wrong, but I can only control 2 in ToZ. (Switch between Rose and Sorey in battle.)\nAlso, no heal focus—really? Two Seraphim have healing and I can't seem to get them to prioritize it. I'm the protagonist of the story, if I want all characters to spam heal me as I lay down the hand of judgement, why stop me? xD\n--\n\n[Too long?]\n\n-Would I recommend it?\nYes.\n\n-Does it have interesting characters, backstory, things to do?\nYes and no. Yes. Yes.\n\n-Does it beat xyz Tales of title?\n\nYes and No. Some aspects are better, some are worse, but that is both subjective and objective reasoning.  More stuff to do, less lovable characters.

The story wasn't anything overly impressive, but it felt right. The cast wasn't very strong in terms of personality, most being one dimsenional, though a few stand out like Edna.  Skill system quite complicated, could be a pro or con depending if you like the needless complexity. The amount of content in the game felt shorter than older games in the series, but maybe I've missed a bunch of hidden side quests?\n\nPros\n[+] Tales of Zestiria's combat system was quite different compared to older Tales of games like Vesperia or Symphonia, but the combat system felt fluid and fun with the extra Blasts and possible combos.\n[+] Kamui/Armatization added more ways to play your party.\n[+] Bamco did a splendid job with the music in this game, the music felt perfect for nearly every area/event in the game.\n[+] Everything is voice acted! (at least most of what I remember).\n\nCons\n[-] Locked party, especially due to Kamui and reasons in the story (makes me sad I can't play as four with whichever characters I want).\n[-] Camera angle definitely gets horrendous shots during battle.\n\nBamco tried to push the skill system even further since previous Tales games ( I haven't played Xillia/2), but it got very complicated and a lot of info is hidden. With the world using seraphim and humans, the party is essentially locked due to "story reasons" and limits who a player wants in his party. This is reminiscent of the Xillia series which I've only read about that had locked parties. Seamless battles were added to allow fights to occur in the exact same layout as your party is walking in on the world map. While great, the camera felt terrible at times where it got stuck directly behind your characters back, making it incredibly frustrating to fight.\n\nOverall, the game isn't anything amazing or special in my eyes, but it is fun and I recommend to 'Tales of' fans and others alike.","December 1, 2015","true","171.6"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","34","38","5","0"

Correct actions in battles result in reduced cool downs. Playing fights well earns you grade, which in turn results in rewards.\nItem Customization is great, items offer abilities and can be mixed.\nItems can be fused\nCinematics are awesome\nToS with preorder. :)What is not good, but not bad  Music is okay, there are some songs that are really good.\nStory is okay, is predictable for the most part.\nYou have to constantly change party memebers, or fights will take a long time.... so if you like having a specific party always, prepare for some long fights as your attacks will not be effective. (low damage, no stuns). You have to adapt to the battle.\nWhat is bad  Dungeons feel generic, caves look the same, forests look the same.\nAI is terrible, even though you can assing specific actions to the party, on boss battles the AI will either go fight and die to a SINGLE combo of the boss, or if you assign defense they will dodge everything prefectly...and not attack at all.\nThey removed the overworld from other tales games, now you have to navigate thru a vast empty map.\nFights now take place where you touch the enemy, which is cool except that camera angles are HORRIBLE most of the time when in caves or dungeons.\n30+ hours in the game, you still get "how to play" messages..since you will most likely forget everything the game tells you.\nMy experience/opinion Game gets repetitive after a while, same dungeons with different colors, same monsters with different color palettes.\nControlling your party is hard, the camera angles doesnt let you see what they are doing, and sometimes you will just get to see that they are dead.\nMost bosses are resistant to multiple elements, so if you pick the only element that can damage them, well prepare to see your party going in and failing to stun the enemy and get punished.\nSometimes it feels that the bosses have enourmous amounts of health, fights feel unecessarily long. Even when using the correct element against them.\nItem customization is huge, but it also makes it harder to see what is best to equip.\nOnce you get your second main character  Rose , it doesnt add variety to the group, it just feels like the main character.\nCharacters have plenty of abilities, too bad you will be armatized  most of the time spamming the same moves over and over.","October 31, 2015","false","32.1"," 88 of 132 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","88","132","4","3"

(on chaos mode)\n\nI haven't played all the tales series (played the Phantasia, and the Abyss), but I have to say that Zestiria has done a good job living the series' rep.\n\nHere's my thought.\n\nVisual and FXThe game looks nice vitually, anime-style. Towns and Fields are interesting to explore. Dungeons are a little too plain, not in a bad way, but I feel that they can be more vivid.\n\nCharacters are good, but there is a number retextured enemies. some looks not as good as the original, but they do their jobs as variations.\n\nGameplayThe combat is a bit unique, a result from mixture between controls and camera. It can be engaging and challenging at times.\n\nHowever, the camera kills. On opened field, it works nicely. In closed area with walls, corridors, your camera can be your worst enemy, it will zoom in from the worst position possible, making you lost track of the combat field, and often KOed by it.\n\nBattle difficulty setting changes the way you play the game.\n\nOn Normal or Hard, you won't find much trouble in progressing as long as you don't rush through it. (who rush this kind of game anyway ...)\n\nIntense and Chaos is where the game truely shine. Artes and Skills selection will play significant part on how you perform, especially in Chaos where the game force you to use everything at your disposal. The combat becomes tactical, button mashing often gets you KOed. The needs to adapt your loadouts will put you into the grinding hell. ;D\n\nStoryYour typical janime-style plot. I love it. There are several jaw-dropping moments, and many of smiling-with-yourself scenes (eww, creepy)\n\nSoundEng voice is okay, but cannot compare to the original Jap voice. It has done an excellent job bringing life into characters.\n\nFor the soundtracks, it's ... where can i get the OSTs disk ? ;)\n\nOverallIt is worth the purchase, too bad my rig can't run at a stable framerate while recording though.\n\nIf you are on the fence, and not waiting for other game atm, get it !

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InuIsInU/recommended/351970/","InuIsInU","Inu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InuIsInU/","196 products in account","Bit rough around the edges but I find the game to be pretty enjoyable overall.\n\nI'll start with what I don't like though:\n- Fusion system is absolute donkey butt. It wasn't anything the Tales series needed, and back in Tales of Vesperia, it wasn't intrusive or forced on you unlike in this game. All-in-all, it's not an interesting system, and sometimes is really roundabout when you want specific skills, and fusion is NEEDED if you want to get stronger. That's just a no in my book.\n- AI really needs work. Higher difficulties are fun and all, but nothing can sour you more than when the AI just refuses to guard when an enemy is telegraphing an attack, or doing an unblockable move (denoted by a "!!").\n- Early on a lot of the wide open spaces are pretty bland, and the dungeon design is much the same throughout the game.\n- English Dubbing. More of personal taste thing, but the Tales series dubbing has declined in quality since Symphonia 2/Xillia, and for me, voice acting makes or breaks the game, so I just stick to the Japanese setting.\n\nThe In-Betweens:\n- Armatization. Extremely fun early on, but once you get late enough into the game, the combo variety is lackluster. The overeliance on it to actually feel like you're making a dent sometimes is problematic, but you don't actually NEED it to do significant damage, it essentially gives you the normal stats you would have in a Tales game by combining both characters, ensuring you don't get 2-3-shot, which will happen fairly often. You can force your AI characters into Armatization, but sometimes they'll undo it almost immediately, or undo it as soon as you switch characters, which is INCREDIBLY wasteful and could use a fix.\n- Combo variety. Much different to previous games where instead of having basic attacks and being able to chain artes into each other, you have martial artes, which are essentially just preset combos, and seraphic artes. Every attack is essentially an arte, and the variety leaves a bit to be desired early on, and you have no basic attacks so you're limited to just 4 moves per combo. Feels really limiting and like an attempt at "Devil May Cry"-style gameplay. Stick to what you're good at, Tales devs! Later on though, it gets a bit more fun, and the moves are pretty cool.\n- Banish Blasts. Are these a joke? I really can't tell. While they ARE indeed powerful attacks, they take long to wind up without the proper skills set, and they can be interrupted EXTREMELY easily, so I went without using them 90% of the time as they just usually wound up being a waste of BC. Could use some changes, unless I'm misunderstanding or not seeing something. Cool in idea, but not execution.\n- Weakness system. Could be better explained. In order to stagger enemies and actually do significant damage, you need to hit an enemy with its weakness, or what it is susceptible to in order to get a "Power Hit" combo going. It's not a bad thing, but I don't consider it a good thing either.\n\nThe Good:\n- I'm actually finding the story and characters to be fairly interesting. Malevolence is uttered A LOT, but the cast is a pretty likable bunch. I could've done without a lot of the Alisha-related things, but other than that, it was nice watching the main character, Sorey, grow as a sheperd.\n- The character designs. Initially, I REALLY disliked the designs back when the game was first unveileved, but they're actually really nice and fairly pleasing to look at, and a HUGE step up from the cluster duck that is the transition of Xillia -> Xillia 2's character designs. Holy jeebus those were an eyesore.\n- The soundtrack has been really great, and some songs like Zaveid's Theme or Rising Up really stick out as great tracks overall.\n- Combat. Being a Tales game, and despite the lack of variety the player experiences early on, once you get later into the game and actually have more than just a "Mash the A Button" combo, it gets a lot more fun, and the variety becomes much more pleasing. The spells are pretty fun, and they make you feel pretty powerful as well.\n- The skill system. I actually like the skill system in this game, but the fusion system makes it a pain to actually get skills you want sometimes. You can stack multiples of the same skill to stack the bonuses you get from them, and unlock more skills as a result, or you can fill up a whole row of skills to unlock stat bonuses that'll help you along. Though it does irk me a bit and makes me feel like min-maxing, and can feel overwhelming and like you need to choose too much in the beginning.\n- Lords of the Land system. This time grade is earned through not only battles, but through the Lords of the Land system, and you can level those up for bonuses, and later unlock something in the game that allows you to boost enemy levels by a large margin, and that's one of the things I enjoyed a lot. There are plenty of more bonuses from the system, but that is one of the more outstanding ones.\n\nDespite the bad things I've said about the game, I'm genuinely enjoying it, and if you don't mind a slow start to things, I'd recommend playing the game. It could've used some more thought and polish, but I think it's a solid entry in the franchise, and a solid game all around. Though hopefully they stop with all this DLC nonsense, 'cause that's just not cool mang.","November 23, 2015","true","71.0"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

I have been a huge fan of Tales of "Series" ever since I played their more popular game titles like Tales of "Symphonia" way back on the Nintendo Gamecube with over 800 hours invested in it with god knows how many playthroughs 8-9-10? I am overjoyed to see Bandai Namco reach out to more than just consoles.\n\nThis is why I love them so much.\nThey still follow the old business model for video games no matter what happens.\n(Trial and Error) Example: Their more recent Tales of "Xillia" I'm not going to lie was a bit of a let down BUT it was their first attempt at a more *Dark* focused storyline rather than a few elements of darkness covered up with a happy/joyful theme, which they quickly regained my and a lot of the fanbases support with Xillia 2 and it's dark and twisted as heck plotline, amazing character developement and CATS! SO MANY CATS!\n\nI have since gone back an played a majority of their first games including...\nTales of "Phantasia" (Holy f... so much fun especially for a SNES game)\nTales of "Destiny" (Fing...Passport Finding Simulator...)\nTales of "Eternia" (Those voice actors tho...)\nTales of "Destiny 2" (By far the best sequel storywise that made sense)\n\nBesides these I have also played...\n\nTales of "Symphonia" over 800 hours of gameplay on record.\nTales of "Symphonia Dawn of the new world" It wasn't the best... but it was something new\nTales of "The Abyss" I absolutely hated LUKE for the majority of the game until he grew up, that spoiled brat...\nTales of "Vesperia" Blah Blah Blah TIDAL WAVE! ~Rita Mordio\nTales of "Graces F" so far the BEST combat in the entire franchise\n(Story could have been better...)\nTales of "Xillia" I didn't really get the idea of what was going on, it felt out of place etc\nTales of "Xillia 2" a huge improvement on Xillia with new combat + choice making.\n\nAll of which were  well over 100 hours of gameplay indept storyline and character backstories for a majority of them. Achievments, costumes from the first titles as a nostalgic thing they just had everything down right.\n\nTales of "Zestiria" is the same in that regard hundreds of hours of gameplay, backstory, hidden events, costumes from previous titles, an EX dungeon that houses characters also from the previous titles sometimes with and without the original voice actors (It's normally just text)\n\nWhat surprised me the most is that Zestiria houses many of the old-titles battle themes like...\nPhantasia  Theme song and many others.\n\nAs a "Veteran" of the Tales series you have no Idea how nostalgic it feels even if I only beat Phantasia a year ago it still feels the same.\n\nZestiria this time around brings a new combat system but also keeps some of the previous titles elements like Vesperia interactive combat mechanics, skills as usual from previous titles aswell, and a more immersive gameplay style to the table, that being no screen-shatter to initiate combat or any kind of loading screen it's all done smoothly as one in a real open world environment that being combat, there is still loading for cities and such.\n\nThe game starts you off as a Human boy named Sorey ("So-Ray") who as a child was born of a special resonance allowing him to see, speak and hear Seraphim (The power needed of that of the Shepard a warrior of purification) as you might expect these are the spirits of the world as like Undine, Efreet, Slyph and Gnome of the previous titles this time they are this time around a human-like race who are linked to the elements Water, Fire, Earth and Air able to form a pact and to be merged with the Shepard through a battle system called Armatization which is Zestirias new combat system that grants you resistance to that elements while in that form and also vice versa to the enemies.\n\nOpen WorldBandai Namco said Zestiria would be a large open world they really did deliver on this.\n\nIt's not as say open as a game like say... Skyrim but in terms of in comparison to Tales of (x)\nThis game is massive! Lot's of hidden things scattered about and very large open fields.\nDungeons, Solo-fight pits for specific characters only things like that just waiting to be found!\n\n\nConclusionWhat I am saying is every single Tales game that have ever been released has always been NEW something that wasn't in a previous game, new characters in some of the sequels instead of focusing on the protagonists of the original.\n\nTales is so damn underrated in the RPG/JRPG realm and for them to finally get the recognition that they deserve makes it all worth the wait. Their games are at best reading and following the main stories 30-40-50 hours long and once you beat them they unlock things you can move over onto your next playthrough to 100% achievment run or just to make it helluvalot harder the next time around easier whatever you want to do.\n\nIt's storyrich, combat rich, character developement...rich sometimes. Sometimes hilarious with the skits and cutscene although Lailah sure is punny... really giving you a sense of personality to each character. It's a hit an miss with the trial and error method but it is what makes them stand above the rest of game developers out there with their recycling models and combat styles always being reused and never polished.\n\n\nTL;DR.\n\nI am glad they finally attempted to reach PC gamers.\nThey have been on all? Consoles Snes-PS3(Mainly)-Xbox360 and now finally PC.\nPC Gamers have a lack of JPRG games perhaps this direction will give us more in the future?\nEither way It's great to have this and you should buy it, even if you wait until it's dirt cheap (Shame on you)\nI highly recommend it.\n\nDo you like cats?9 out of 10 cats recommend this game.","October 19, 2015","true","68.5"," 101 of 158 people (64%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","64","101","158","29","31"

How does ToZ manage to elevate itself into what is at least considered a highly-above-average JRPG?\nWell - aside from the mundane story, we should firstly take a look at our cast of characters. Our protagonist, Sorey, is the first major factor. When we start the game, we can't choose his class, name, appearance or anything - which for some may very well be a negative, though it does enable the game to give him an actual persona. The player isn't meant to project himself into Sorey, but to emphasize with him during the game when the albeit few, yet very strong choices come up.\nThis is very important for Zestiria because although the story is as straight-forward and predictable as it gets, the characters are what makes it bearable. Your other party members all fit some sort of stereotype, as I already implied in the Opening, yet the game still manages to keep you interested. It manages to keep the cast on a level which is light-hearted, fitting with the story, yet tries to make you care for each and every member of your party.\n\nThis is were the first gameplay aspect shines: Skits;\nSomething I've not yet seen in many RPG's but may be compared to gameplay elements akin to the Camping of Dragon Age. Meaning: In Zestiria, if you for example explore a cave for some quest or even just to grind you can unlock "Skits" - or Dialogues between your characters by checking out different locations within that dungeon. These dialogues may only be humorous, may convey gameplay-explanations such as equiment fusion or may actually give some insight in the characters themselves. Though every single Skit is absolutely cleverly written and it is what always keeps the player hooked on the story and character progression, rather than violently seperating it's Gameplay from any form of party interaction.\n\nThe gameplay is not as in-depth as you may expect. What the game does is giving you a Rock-Paper-Scissors System which is called Artes. M. Artes > Mg. Artes > S. Artes and so on. Though this Artes System comes down to basically a combo system which you are expected to keep up with by learning needlessly complex Weapon Effects and how the different combat-aspects can be combined with one another.\nYou now might think "What is your problem with that? Sounds to me like a very in-depth system!" - This is only half true, really, as the game not only offers you a simple solution: You can spend AP (earned mainly by exploring) to unlock effects such as "Auto-Sidestep" or Control over your Partners or your actual movement <-- I've got a personal grudge against the last one, as the game arbitrarily locks many of your combat settings behind this AP-Wall. Want to move freely around the battlefield? No can do. You have to learn the Shortcut on your Pad and press it everytime you want to move as you like.\n\nThe thing that really kills this system though is that all this is not really necessary, as the difficulty of the game mainly comes down to micro-managing your party and if you're in a boss fight or not. Generally you can only control 1 character at a time + you can give vague commands to your teammates. Depending on your difficulty and on the enemy, this makes some bosses a nightmare. As the game requires you to learn patterns for bosses which may or may not result in 1-HKO's otherwise. Not being able to control the party AI properly is a big (-) in that case. Otherwise bosses tend to overscale horribly contrary to the laughable trash-mobs you encounter in any dungeon.\n\nIs the combat system inherently bad though? Not really.. but it is definitely not the optimal mix between semi-strategy and action you might hope for, when thinking of buying this game. Many combat mechanics are just impractical, leaving the player to just stick with their standart-combos, which don't require you to learn some new shortcut, to rebind your new combos to any new button and so on. This of course also means, that players who want to get the maximum out of their character can still do so. It just requires a lot of getting used to and is in many cases just a wasted effort.\n\n\nTL;DR\n+ Great soundtrack\n+ Clever character/party interaction\n+ No separation between story/character progression and gameplay\n+ In-depth customization (Gameplay + Characters)\n+ Rewards exploration\n+ NG+\n\n- Generic JRPG Story\n- Too much Info-dumping (Tutorial Messages throughout the game)\n- Camera issues (Can somewhat be fixed by unlocking your movement in combat: See the next point)\n- Some basic combat mechanics have to be unlocked first (e.g. Moving freely)\n- Combat needlessly complex (at least when playing on anything below Hard-difficulty) and bad control over the rest of your party\n\nNow many of these flaws are very subjective. I found myself enjoying the story despite its flaws, as Zestiria just presents itself so well - with the beatiful graphics and the outstanding soundtrack coupled with the character design of which I talked previously. The rest of the negatives are just my personal issues with the combat system which may very well not apply to you. Thus I recommend checking out a gameplay video on Youtube, before buying Zestiria.\nAll in all it is a very good JRPG for a reasonable price. Is it a must play? No. Certainly not. Fans of the genre will still have a wonderful time with it.\n\n\nEdna is best girl and Rose is far cooler than Alisha *Drops mic*","October 24, 2015","true","39.1"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","29","35","7","0"

(Edit)\n\nNot a con but not a pro:\n-There are some markers that tell you where to go, that kills a little the exploration part.\n-Conversations between characters during gameplay sometimes seem like a "subtle" way to tell you where to go next, they don't seem "organic" or "natural"; a little bit forced.\n-Not completely open world.\n-Some assets were taken from Xillia 1 & 2.\n\nCons:\n-The camera while fighting is not that comfortable.\n-Despite the fact that the models look more human on their movements, their facial expressions look odd; and during some moments you'll feel uncomfortable looking at their expressions.\n-Skits aren't as common as in other games of the series.\n-SO MANY TUTORIALS AND TIPS!\n-IT IS NOT THAT EASY TO WATCH THE JIGGLY PHYSICS IN ACTION!!!!

It's just so refreshing to have a tales game not so laden with anime tropes that I am frankly sick of at this point. I also love how straightforward the story of this game is. No world bending plot twists, just the simple story of the Shepherd Sorey's journey with his human and Seraphim friends, with little twists and turns along the way. I know this is a negative for plenty of other players, but it's another thing that I found quite refreshing. I at least enjoyed it more than the other games mentioned above.\n\nP.S.

What do they want? What drives them? In Tales of Vesperia, within minutes of meeting of meeting the protagonist you understood his motivation and got to watch him and his friends grow over the next 40-odd hours. In Zestiria, I still couldn't tell you why the protagonist, Sorey, is even on his adventure. He seems to have shrugged his shoulders and said, "Meh, let's save the world." He's basically the character equivalent of plain, dry toast: inoffensive and uninteresting.\n\nIf characterization is paper thin, the plot is almost see-through. Most villains vanish, defeated, within minutes of meeting them. Schemers will tell you their entire plan at the drop of a hat. Whatever amorphous Big Bad lurks behind the scenes hasn't made so much as a single appearance. The party seems to bounce from area to area without any lead-in or world-building of any kind. I don't care about where we are or what we're doing because the game hasn't given me a reason to.\n\nYes, the combat system is messy, needlessly complicated, and arcane. And yes, the combat camera just loves to point at walls or the enemy's ankles. Honestly, I could live with that.\n\nBut I can't live with the fact that, after half a DAY of play, I don't care about these characters or this world.","October 21, 2015","false","11.8"," 245 of 422 people (58%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","58","245","422","23","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DUFFKING/recommended/351970/","DUFFKING","Duffking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DUFFKING/","179 products in account","I love the Tales series. Every single game in the series I've been able to play has been incredibly compelling from start to finish, and really felt like more than the sum of its parts. Sadly, Zestiria is the exception to that latter part. It's every bit as compelling as most of the series, yet while every element of a Tales game is present and correct, each feels severely undercooked.\n\nThe game's characters are perhaps its strongest points, but still fails to reach the bar set by most of the previous games I've played in the series, coming out just ahead of Graces F. The best Tales game feature a protagonist who is both interesting and develops in something other than power as the plot progresses. Yuri and Luke were great examples of this archetype. Jude was not, but Milla as a joint protagonist meant it didn't matter. Sorey (this game's lead) is a bit of an Asbel (from Tales of Graces) - he's simply not interesting. He exists to be the protagonist. There is a hint of potential for Sorey: he grew up surrounded by Seraphim, human-like creatures most humans cannot see. He's never met another human, but is thrust into a great adventure. The stage is set for an nice traditional "small town kid in big city" sort of arc, then completely ignored from about 2 horus into the game. Sorey pooters from place to place, doing as he is told by exposition with little agency of his own.\n\nThe rest of the party are thankfully a bit more interesting. The best three characters elevate the weakest, and the interactions of even the weakest characters are still enjoyable to see. Edna steals the show overall, toying with the gullability of the other characters and often coming close to breaking the fourth wall with some sarcastic quips. Lailah's sudden switches from seriousness from serious to carefree are well handled rather than jarring. It's a shame that unlike games like Vesperia, we never learn much about most of the cast. They're slaves to the plot, and not a lot more.\n\nSpeaking of that plot, it's all over the place. It's obviously inspired by Arthurian legends - a sword in a stone, round tables, and so on. Yet it doesn't really go anywhere. It's a typical chosen-one-versus-evil plotline for the most part, with few twists. The main antagonist is absent for a huge portion of the game - we're told of their existence, but most of the game sees you trundling about the world Getting Stronger (TM every JRPG ever). For the first third, the game feels as though it *is* building to a reveal, only to send you on a Zelda like quest to 4 temples for the next third and completely ignoring any sort of ongoing buildup altogether, until someone suddenly realised they needed stuff to happen and abrubtly kicks the story into gear again via a bunch of confusing flashbacks leaving me completely confused.\n\nCombat in Zestiria is an interesting one - it's got depths in spades, that much is for sure. You know this, because for the first few horus of the game it resembles a continuous information dump in the form of popup windows explaining things, never to be seen again. It's compeltely bemusing at first, especially as many of the tutorials aren't exactly relevant until later in the game when you have more skills and party members to make use of. A lot of the complexity is wasted on encounters that feel like processions anyway.\n\nThe core is split in two - the first half sees you control a single character in real time. You can perform dodges and attacks in chains of four. Each uses up some spirit chain (SC), which at a basic level recharges when you're not attacking. To reduce the waiting and encourage aggressive play, successful attack dodges refill SC. You can extend action chains beyond four by spending part of your Blast Gauge (BG) to do a special sort of atack, itself refilled by guarding and dodging. It's a cool system that generally rewards agressive battles.\n\nThe second half is the Armatus - spending a BG to combine your controlled character with another party member. You get super powerful elemental attacks, lots of health and it looks awesome. The bigger your combo when you activate it, the more damage you do initially. Sadly, after the combat clicks, we get the procession I mentioned above: for every encounter, your partner with the Seraph matching your enemy's weakness, build a combo then Armatize to win. BG is so plentiful, there's little reason not to Armatize to ease through fights quickly. And you'll want to, because you'll be fighting a lot.\n\nPart of this constant fighting is due to the dungeon design, which apparently exists in 2 types. Story dungeons are at least reasonably unique, especially the elemental temples. They have a few interesting puzzles here or there, and are pretty good fun to get through. However, many are visually similar - there's far too many long hallways and open rooms and not a lot else outside of the elemental temples, and little in the way of interesting visuals. The side dungeons are worse: cut and paste collections of corridors and open spaces that go on, and on, and on. They're dull trudges from easy fight to easy fight, that get longer and longer as the game goes on.\n\nThe visual blandness in dungeons is a shame, as the game can look quite pretty outside of them. The pre dungeon field areas are almost universally home to interesting layouts and fun to explore. Initially gloomy, restoring blessings makes them look alive and beautiful. Pendrago's exterior is a real highlight. It makes entering the average dungeon a disappointment, because it means another hour of trudging through corridors.\n\nFinally, the skill system. I mentioned the barrage of tutorial popups earlier, but the undisputed champion of poor explanation is the skill system. To attempt to explain it, each piece of equipment will boost two stats, and has four slots for skills. Each skill has an element and a group. Each element corresponds to arow on a grid, and groups correspond to a column. Equipping gear fills in your skill grid with the skills on the equipment. The idea is you equip gear such that you fill in 3-in-a-row, 5-in-a-column, or stack multiple of the same skills. This boosts their effects, and bestows powerful bonus skills - fill in the first column for a character, and all stats get a 20% boost. You can fuse together items of the same type to combine their skills and improve their stats.\n\nIt's a cool idea, but hamstrung because the amount of grinding it will take to deliberately make rows and columns makes it far more effective to just equip whatever gear gives the right character the right stats and treat skill matches as a happy accident. Mechanics are in place to boost drop rates and the chance of dropped gear having specific skills, but it's not a fun prospect fighting the same enemies over and over hoping that the right type of gear will drop for the right character, with the right skill for hours at a time, knowing that you'll get stronger gear eventually anyway and have to do it all again.\n\nSo that's Tales of Zestiria. Recognisably a Tales game, and there's fun to be had for JRPG fans. But aside from some cool ideas (seriously, battles taking place on the overworld/dungeon itself rather than in a seperate arena is a great touch), the entire game feels sorely undercooked.","November 4, 2015","false","31.1"," 59 of 94 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","59","94","3","2"

I've played a few in the past, and will just say that this one kept me entertained but didn't knock my socks off.  Worth a play-through (My logged hours are up there from falling asleep while playing, which probably says something about the game). As to some of the other reviews I’m reading on here, I personally really like the equipment customization/fusion aspect of the game.  It gives some breadth and actually easily allows you to manipulate your fighting style should you get bored (not that having 6 characters to choose from doesn’t allow that).\n\nI also didn’t really ever have trouble with the camera as a lot of people are saying.  The combat system was very refreshing, and as someone who loves grinding it didn’t feel like I had to do much, if any, for the game given how much the equipment customization affects you and the regenerating stat herb items that can be found EVERYWHERE.  However, by the end of the game I found myself just fast –traveling and using enemy-repellant holy bottles when I was running around in the fields.\n\nAs for the insane amount of goofy, irrelevant cut scenes that come along with Tales’ games, at a certain point, puns become annoying.  There are other comedic devices you can use.\n\nWhich leads me to my biggest con of the game, the story/continuity…\n\nComing in, I'd expected (Knowing Tales’ games) the story to be convoluted and not make sense at various points.  I was not disappointed. Of the various times I asked myself “What’s going on here?”,  I will say that by the end of the game the story as a whole seems to make sense.  It’s indulging the writers to get there that’s tough.  The game is filled with so many holes and unresolved plot events that ruin continuity I can’t begin to go into them all. But the biggest, most massive, undeniably huge one is its basic premise (semi-spoiler)…\n\nTo not overcomplicate things with specifics, there’s 3 types of characters in the game: Humans, Seraphim, and Hellions.  Essentially, the story goes that Humans (minus our protagonist Sorey and company) are unenlightened, ungrateful, hate-producing low-lifes that normally can’t see Seraphim and Hellions.  Seraphim are enlightened, elementally powered spirit beings who live amongst humans.  Hellions are evil/corrupted humans and seraphim.   To try not go into a long diatribe with specifics on just how many times the game contradicts this most fundamental law it sets up for itself (It’s literally laughable), it is single-handedly the biggest issue I have with the game as it totally screws with continuity and any sane person trying to relate to the story would think that Sorey isn’t some sort of savior, but a bat$hit crazy person that talks to ghosts.  For instance, when he is conversing with secondary characters AND having conversations within their core group, wouldn’t it seem like he is talking to the air or that there are insanely long awkward pauses while our seraphim are discussing amongst themselves?\n\nI’ll also say that character development is pretty flat throughout the game.  Barring the major event to set up the game’s ending, nothing really happens to change any of the characters’ outlook or core values.  And even that event doesn’t change much, as it’s more of a “I know what has to be done now” moment and Sorey continues to go on as a one-dimensional, pure of heart, do-gooder.\n\nLooking back at the game, I’m thinking that the developers probably had a lot more content to put in. There’s a solid game in there but it’s just empty compared to other Tales’ entries.\n","November 29, 2015","true","151.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Just putting this on record since I will mention some bugs that may not be here in the future.\n\nShort Version: I quite like this game. It has some problem here and there but nothing that'll turn me off about it.\n\nLong Version:\nSo 11 hours in, I guess that's a good place to be in for a first impression on a JRPG. So like many JRPGs, it's a slow burn. For a Tales game, it might be one of the slowest burns. In terms of story, it's pretty standered... in the start. That said, it does take a while before it gets intesting. Combat is pretty much the same way. With the initial skills and the enemy difficulty, combat doesn't start too interesting. A suggestion for the start, I suggest using your partner character (Mikleo) and if you're an old time Tales player, try going for the higher difficulties. Ok, with that initial start, lets get into some detail.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks nice. From how the enviorment looks, to the character models there is a ton of appeal to the game visually. There are however some shortcomings. You will notice that the outline for the characters aren't as clean as some would like. It's not too big of an issue unless you're really looking for it though. There are also times when the characters are holding something and it looks like it kinda flouts there but I imagine that's more of an engine problem than anything. There is also one particular part in the first dungeon that doesn't look to amazing. You'll come across a certain door with a certain "seal" and well it doesn't look like it fits into anything else there. Now for some bugs. There are some parts of the game where the background shutters and the character models get streched out. That said, I've come across at most 5 instances of this in a 11 hour period. Any other problems, I either didn't see or mind.\n\nTL;DR: Looks nice, a few graphics glitches.\n\nCombat:  Like mentioned earlier, the gameplay in the START is a little bland. Older Tales players will find the combat simplistic in easier difficulties and New Tales player may find it fun in the start but slowly see it get a little old. This can be remedied a little by playing in higher difficulties or starting out with Mikleo (your first partner Character). NOW I did try to mention and ingrain into those reading this how it STARTS this way, hinting it might not be so later. It does take a while for the combat to become more exciting. This Tales game relies on more dashes and side movements. At a later point bosses will actually become a challenge and simply attacking is a possible stratagy but you will be opening your items menu a lot or replaying the same battle quite often. Learning how to move around in the free space and doing quick dashes is where this particular Tales game shines. As where other Tales games have a nice amount of free movement, this one lets you see how to make use of larger spaces and timing your quick dashes. This battle system isn't perfect though. It does need a lot of work and we can only hope the next installment will have that. Though at this time, there is enough here to make for a fun and interesting experience.\n\nTL;DR: Fun combat that relies on more open movement and quick dashes though starts out very simplistic. Will look forward to this in future installments.\n\nGeneral Gameplay:  As a whole, there is a lot to do and fun to be had but I will say, it's a little simplistic at some parts. First off, the vast open world is great. A lot to look at, a few secrets here and there. That said, I kinda wish there was more. Going back the the fact I'm 11 hours in, I wish I was back tracking already. The map is very comprehensive... a bit too much though. Looking through the world gives you treasure and some hints that give you some Action Points... and that's kinda it. I mean there are some extra places to got to but nothing too interesting or even have access to until maybe quite a while from now. They also easily point out where your next objective is with an easy marker which kinda kills the need to pay attention to some parts of the dialog. It's not entirely a bad thing though. This means that you don't get lost in the map and considering how large it is, getting lost would be pretty easy. It's just a little easy is all.\nAn interesting system at a later part of the game though is being able to unlock new bonues in ther area by fighting or offering items you don't care for. It gives the player some busy work if they decide they just want to mess around of a bit. Most of the other systems are skill there like how you can set how characters act in battle, to some things that your character does while just moving around passively. The way items are handled are nice to in that several of the same item might not actually be the case since some might give a different skill bonus from other ones. Generally the old systems that Tales players have had but made a little bit more intesting. One last thing about the systems, cooking system is non-existent in this game which I personally liked but some of you may not to that's a toss up for good or bad. Ok last thing for this section which is a little bit of a sour subject amoung you all. This game is Locked to 30 fps. Personally I don't mind it. Even in 30, it still looks, moves and plays wonderful. I do understand the points people have when they would like a game to be in 60, but for me if it was on 60, that a bonus not a requirment. This is not to served as a warning or to turn people off on the idea or to accept my or anyones ideals, I'm just pointing out that this game is at 30 fps. Ok, I think we go through that alright... I hope. NEXT\n\nTL;DR: Exploration aspect could use some work, no cooking system, same as many Tales games with some additions.\n\nStory: (Spoilers... actually not really) To Old Tales Players: It's a Tales game with some extra political aspect that I personally like. Story-wise is interesting but what really shines are the interesting assortment of characters. So nothing too new in terms of Tales game but has interesting aspects added in to keep it fresh.\nTo New Tales Players: You're the Chosen hero (spoilers) that battle the evils of the world with your interesting assortment of friends. There's some intersting ways the game deals with some politics though the shine of Tales games are it's characters not as much with the story. Not that it isn't interesting though.\n\nTL;DR: Uhh, it wasn't too long, I don't think I need to add anything much here, though if I must, Boom bam, powers, friendship, done.\n\nConclusion: This is a game worth getting in my opinion. Old Tales Players will find that the combat in particular starts out simplistic and bland but keeping to it will later yield some ways of playing that may vary form other Tales and gives a interesting insight on how later installments may have for us. Newer Players will find the Story a little slow and might become bored of the battle system early on. To them I urge them to do their research on the game. See if you'd like how the game is played and how systems appeal to you. If you aren't sure of what you see, wait for it to go on sale. To those who already bought it keep to it. It's a long ride and it takes a long while before it starts getting good.\nTo Both: Do your research. The game does have some bugs that may have something to do with your hardware. If all else fails, wait for a new patch that might have a fix for you. This game is wonderful and it'd be a waste for you to not enjoy it.","October 21, 2015","true","65.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

It reminds me of JRPG titles such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. On top of the classic JRPG components, Tales of Zestiria added some new elements, such as narratives, customization, and a polished battle system.\n\nStory: The story moves at a pretty nice pace and keeps you engaged. A lot of characters interaction, as well as dynamic events happening in the world around you.\n\nMusic: Beautiful BGM. The Japanese voice acting is great as well.\n\nArt style: Great designs. A lot of details on the characters and the surrounding world.\n\nBattle system: The battle system feels a bit awkward at first, and may take some time to get used to. Overall, the battle system keeps the battle at a fast pace with nice flashy effects.\nOne downside though is that the battles feel a little bit too easy; most of the battles can be won by smashing the buttons. For that reason, I really recommend setting the difficulty to high when you're comfortable.\n\nTL:DR: Great story, music, characters, and polished battle system. However the gameplay is not very challenging. If you are a hardcore RPG fan, you may be disappointed by the easiness of the game. That being said, I still really enjoy my time playing Tales of Zestiria; and I would definitely recommend it.\n\nA good pick-up for any JRPG fan. It is also a good entry title for people new and trying to get into JRPG. However, don't get it if you're looking for a challenging hardcore RPG experience.","October 25, 2015","true","6.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

I thought Symphonia was excellent. I remember Destiny and Vesperia being pretty good. Sadly, Zestiria was a disappointment for me. I didn't start to enjoy it until about 20 hours in when I decided to change the difficulty setting, as I felt the fights were too easy. I would have quit were it not for the combat, as everything else was severely lacking. I wanted to like the game because I have faith in the Tales series, but I found myself pushing for the end just to see what would happen with the story. My feelings after completion of the game can be summed up as "oh" and "that's it?"\n\nPROS:\n\n• Abilties that look and sound cool when executing; you feel strong in battle.\n• Various difficulty settings that can be changed at any time and make defeating bosses feel sufficiently challenging.\n• Good music.\n• The Japanese voiceovers are good.\n\nCONS:\n\n• Very weak and predictable story with no twists. It had potential but felt like an idea rather than a fully developed plot. You are left with many questions and no answers.\n• Characters are flat and don't feel genuine. You are told insead of shown who they are.\n• The villains are a joke and have little to no backstory or motivation.\n• Cringy, forced, repetitive dialogue.\n• Camera issues while in combat.\n• Copy and paste dungeons with little to no puzzles.\n• Constantly shown the same tutorial messages even when you are halfway through the game.\n• Repetitive actions, such as reading monolith stones, which give you the same tutorials previously mentioned.\n• Convoluted equipment/crafting system.\n• Optional content/side quests can be completed very quickly and don't add much to the story. You still don't know who the characters are or learn anything compelling about the world. It feels rushed and insincere, just as the main story does.\n• No incentive to play the NG+ Just more grinding through a vast but lifeless realm.\n\nTales of Berseria looks promising, though it is a prequel to Zestiria.

A lot of these elements aren't throwaway; utilizing every tool you're given leads to a lot of success and satisfaction, unlike a lot of things that I didn't see the need to bother with in past Tales games. There aren't any forced tutorials that are long-winded; any in the game are quickly handled, with a lengthy record and lexicon for players who really wish to sink their teeth in. The armatization ability does get pretty overpowered, sadly. There's also a handful of slipups outside of battle like the obnoxious Water Trial.\n\nWith some fixes, the game runs at a groovy 60FPS, always welcome for a high action game like this. I enjoyed a lot of the nice, fairly open environments compared to past games as well. The way hopping into battle works, directly from where you are in the world, lends to occasional camera problems in combat (and even worse when playing with multiple players). I've found that Zesteria packs the best soundtrack the series has had in quite a while. The story is okayish, par enough with recent Tales games, but like those, the party's interactions is where the series shines.\n\nOverall, Zestiria has my recommendation and I hope for future successes from this series on Steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clessaileron/recommended/351970/","clessaileron","Cless Aileron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clessaileron/","247 products in account","So, I've been around the block with the Tales series since 1999 after playing Tales of Destiny. With the series constantly hanging around the Playstation consoles while also having some appearances on Nintendo systems and one appearance on the Xbox 360, a PC version of a Tales game was something I thought would never happen. But here I am reviewing the first Tales game to appear on Steam. If anything, the game itself, while flawed, isn't as bad as people made it out to be, particularly during the original Japanese PS3 release of it, and as a PC port, does put its best foot forward despite some issues.\n\nThe Tales series isn't really known for pushing system specs to the limit, but the visuals do have a vibrant look to them with small details of leaves blowing in the wind in the fields.\n\nWith the music of Graces & the two Xillia games, I did feel like Motoi Sakuraba was pretty much phoning it in for those installments. Zestiria was a huge improvement in the music department this time thanks to Go Shiina contributing tracks alongside Sakuraba. While I actually hold the unpopular opinion that Go Shiina's previous soundtrack contribution to the series, Tales of Legendia, isn't really all that great, his talent really shines for me this time with some great dungeon music.\n\nThe story had some controversy because of how one particular character was handled. After seeing it for myself, it was nothing to really freak out about. The story itself, for better or worse, does follow typical Tales quality (I did enjoy it though). The character are likable and engaging, though it's also on the typical Tales quality, for better or worse.\n\nNow, for the highlight of the series, its real time battle system. It's like a simplified fighting game, moving the character, linking attacks together to combo the enemy in real time movement. This time, the battles are done on the same exploration screen. However, there's issues with the camera, specifically if the area you're in battle at happens to be a narrow corridor. The camera will be too zoomed in for you to assess the battle field until you move into a better location. There's no way to rotate the camera during the battle (the best you get would be in the menu). It's not enough to condemn the game, but it's going to be an issue at certain times. The battle system is still as fun as ever as you combo the enemies to grind for experience & money.\n\nAs far as the PC port is concern, I'll deal with the elephant in the room and say that it's a bummer that it was locked at 30 FPS but I was able to live with it. Outside of that, the port does have the graphics tweaking option that is supposed to be there, along with keyboard & mouse support to the point where you can navigate the menu using the mouse cursor.\n\nOverall, the game was not as bad as it was made out to be. The story is pretty much not high literature and can be enjoyable alongside the characters with the typical Tales quality. The battle system still shines as bright as it ever has despite some issues. If you can handle that this PC port locked the framerate at 30, I can still give this a recommendation.\n\nWelcome to PC gaming, Tales series.","November 4, 2015","true","141.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm a fan of the Tales of franchise, so I was excited to play this game. After giving this game some time I've noticed lots of points to know.\n\nAs a Tales of game the story starts off rather strong and becomes rather weak around the middle to end. They take their time investing your interest into the initial main heroine just so that they could kick her out of the party and add her later on as optional DLC. You spend time getting to like her and she just leaves without question.. No one tries to stop her..\n\nAs for gameplay, the worst part is the camera angles.. The game doesn't feel as fluid as most other tales of games.. Normally the game lets me know if an enemy is able to block or tank hits or if they are vulnurable to attack, this game is kind of a coin flip. One big defect is the frequent copy paste monsters..\n\nAll in all, I'd play it, I don't know if I would recommend it to other people who havent played any of the games in the franchise though. I look forward to future tales releases though.

With that out of the way, I can honestly say I was blown away by this game.\n\nI really had miminal expectations before playing this game - but I gotta hand it to Bandai Namco, this game is a great way to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the "Tales of" series.\n\nReview - SPOILER FREE:This game starts out kinda slow - actually not kinda, but really slow, but after playing for a couple of hours while you gather all the party members, this game picks up huge steam and goes with that awesome pace up until the end.\n\nStory:The story starts like it's gonna be one of those happy go stories of let's save the world! but the deeper you delve into the game the darker it becomes while still maintaining a lot of fun moments. The story holds well with good backround lore of the characters.\n\nSpeaking of characters, the cast of this game is really great, the interaction between all the main characters is awesome, especially Edna - what a great and funny character.\nBut not limited to Edna, all the characters are fleshed out and great.\nThe game is filled with fun dialogue in the form of "skits", a mainstay of "Tales of" games. The game makes great use of cinematics, both in-game engine and also thhe well animated cutscenes.\n\nThe game is full of moments that make you genuinely smile, while other will make you genuinely tear up. This was only possible because of the well written characters.\n\n\nMusic:In my opinion, having played 4 games in the series, this game has the best OST of any of them. What a beautifully made soundtrack.\nBattles have nice BGM that will pump you up, Boss battles have their own too - but one AWESOME song plays in one of the final battles that really cemented this series as the best soundtrack.\nDungeons have good BGM, but what truly shines is the BGM of the Trial Dungeons which are masterfully done.\n\nCombat:As in any Tales game, the combat is what truly shines. Developed by Namco Bandai, the Advanced Battle System (ABS) is an action based combat that let's you freely move in the battlefield while using combos to fight.\nThe abilities in this game are categorised as Martial Artes, Hidden Artes and Seraphic Artes - these abilies make the basis of the Battle System.\n\nAlso, this game has a fusion system where 2 characters can fuse in battle to gain hightened battle abilities. In addition, all characters have a finisher move that does massive damage called "Mystic Artes".\nthere are 5 elements in this game - Fire, water, wind, earth, and physical. All enemies have specific weaknesses and resistances to these elements - in order to win boss battles and harder enemies, you need to exploit these weaknesses.\n\nConclusion:In addition to the massive content, I'm 58 hours in and still have plenty of optional bosses and dungeons to complete and even a New Game+ for people who are into that.\nAll these elements make this game a great addition to the fabled "Tales of" line-up.","December 17, 2015","true","62.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vitiel/recommended/351970/","vitiel","Poxni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vitiel/","175 products in account","I'm so glad the "Tales of" franchise has been finally hitting Steam, starting off with what may now be my favorite entry in the series.\n\nThere's a lot of good game design nuance found in Zestiria, with a lot of game mechanics flowing into each other nicely. A lot of these elements aren't throwaway; utilizing every tool you're given leads to a lot of success and satisfaction, unlike a lot of things that I didn't see the need to bother with in past Tales games. There aren't any forced tutorials that are long-winded; any in the game are quickly handled, with a lengthy record and lexicon for players who really wish to sink their teeth in. The armatization ability does get pretty overpowered, sadly. There's also a handful of slipups outside of battle like the obnoxious Water Trial.\n\nWith some fixes, the game runs at a groovy 60FPS, always welcome for a high action game like this. I enjoyed a lot of the nice, fairly open environments compared to past games as well. The way hopping into battle works, directly from where you are in the world, lends to occasional camera problems in combat (and even worse when playing with multiple players). I've found that Zesteria packs the best soundtrack the series has had in quite a while. The story is okayish, par enough with recent Tales games, but like those, the party's interactions is where the series shines.\n\nOverall, Zestiria has my recommendation and I hope for future successes from this series on Steam. Too bad how Symphonia turned out, but that's a different story.","April 6","true","187.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Gameplay thats tried and true, but still a fresh take on it. The ONLY thing I wish they had were notifiers such as when you complete an evade properly.

I simply saw the add for this game, saw the screenshots, some PS3 gameplay and bought it for the Art Style and Combat System.\n\nSo far, no regrets for getting this game. Love it!\n\nI am still not done with the game, but the story so far has been extremely fun! Its full of wonder, mystery, and hilarious conversations and skits between all the characters. Their interactions are very charming at times and it practically feels like I am playing an anime. So far, I'd give the story a 7/10 hands down and can't wait to see where it goes!\n\nCombat may look very easy, but it comes with so many stats, systems, combinations, artes, and other aspects that I have to give it a straight up 10/10 for how in-depth it is. The combat down the line gets really comples to the point where I would recommend looking up taking time with it. Also, look out for enemy weakness and exploit it. Also, again, strategize your party and each member so that everyone properly works together.\n\nThe sound is awesome, English voice acting isn't too bad, and the music is so good and atmospheric! 8/10!\n\nCharacters are quirky and fun to interact with! Each one has great diverse personalities and charm to them! Each one is loveable and admirable in their own way. I am certain everyone is going to find a character they like the most. Love each character! 9/10!\n\nThe background and graphics for the game are fantastic! Feels very artistic and anime-like! It blends 2D and 3D really well while still making it feel like I am playing an anime-like JRPG game! The visuals alone get a pretty sweet 10/10 from me for the art style!\n\nOverall, if you find this game on sale, like the Steam Anime Sale, get it! Worth it!","May 1","true","30.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

On high end rigs, and with the mod, it runs at 2160p supersampling 60fps on fairly high powered systems without a hitch. The keyboard controls are never ideal for this type of game but god damn they tried and it shows. No advanced rendering options, but Tales games are always about the art style graphically, not the BLEEDING EDGE GRAFIX!!!1one, it's mostly just LOD options.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty well put together. It's not standard Tales fare, it's a janky beast of its own. Skill won't win the day here, you'll have to overprepare due to the amount of jank and lack of polish. Armitization, dualizing with the spirit characters, eliminates all but the highest levels of difficulty, then the game throws the party systems to the wind at interspersed spots through the game taking the crap from under you.\n\nThe story, oh god the story. Don't even bother. A strong start belies a rampant case of Author Tract. Rose goes from being a mild annoyance to an actual main character. I'm not kidding. Hideo Baby, it's reported, trainwrecked his own story because he got a raging katana over Rose's voice actor, turning the once actually-well-nuanced stories of Tales games into Rose's Mary Sue Adventures featuring Sorey the ♥♥♥♥boy (Who the ♥♥♥♥ Is Alisha Edition). The localization gets amazingly bad and disjointed later on, having people sound like they're having two halves of a conversiation and hinting at things that aren't even relevant concepts.\n\nGo Shiina and Motoi Sakuraba put their heads together for standard Tales over-orchestration for the battle themes, sounding entirely more grand than the next batch of mooks to fight. It's a welcome return to form.\n\nIf you're a Tales fan, prepare to cringe hard. If you're here for the PC port, there's a lot to love with its flaws. Tentatively recommended.","March 29","true","69.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is all an adventure which you may have seen before, and as such, begins with a sword in a stone. Once removed, the questionable spirit guides the schizophrenic shephard as he tends to his lambs- I mean people; and when questions are asked, she dodges with "how nice the weather is" or "look at that pretty butterfly".\n\nHe soon discovers that to create a sanctuary in the first zone, he has a meeting\nwith a priest, right after he gets payed for treatment, in the middle of the street, in squatting positions.\n\nHe then gets holy water blessed by his devoted ice mage who randomly produces ice cream with his talents, and a once underwhelming snake boss angel guy, to bless the land once more.\n-So that he may once again pay money to teleport between save points!\n\nLike all Tales of games: so many plot devices railroad me! Rocks procariously placed, the inability to jump, and invisible walls, I may as well be playing train simulator at this point.\n\nI soon am guided to a round table, after I pull a sword from a stone.\nMight be just me but im noticing some odd similarities here.\n\nIn these areas why are there so many open spaces with nothing in them, like in the first dungeon there are these room that are utterly empty except a bat or two to fight.\nWhat were the builders thinking when the architects told them to make it so?\n"Ey baws, you sure you don't want anythin in here?"\n"Aye, we can just stick some bats here and there, no one will question it"\n-Room Complete!

Gorgeous & immersive scenery all through the game.\nBrilliant storyline and memorable, relatable characters.\nSave points are everywhere, and fast-travel between them (once unlocked) is very helpful.\nQuick-save feature available anytime. (Except for when you're standing in a doorway, oddly enough.)\nThere are very few (if any) "limited window" objectives you can miss. I always found I was able to go back and do something / get something if needed, and never had to revert to a prior save file.\nA character attribute (once unlocked) lets you speed up travel through the world & dungeons.\nWonderfully animated, both in the 3D scenes and drawn character cut-scenes.\nMusical score is magnificently beautiful, setting the audiable ambience for every single experience in utterly perfect fashion. The composer(s) should be nominated for the highest awards, and given expensive top-shelf cocktails upon demand. Absolutely above-par for any "Tales of" series game .... holy s**t, I cannot express my eargasm pleasure enough here.\nOutstanding voice-acting, and PLENTY of amusing akward moments (and some toucing ones, too) between the characters. Excellent humor and comic relief at all the right times.\nEquipment & items can be traded for points toward valuable geographic region perks, rather than having to battle-grind to earn the points.\nMultiple of the same piece of equipment can be "fused" multiple times to create a stronger piece of equipment.\nENORMOUS variety of equipment! Almost too much so if you don't periodically fuse equipment or clean-out your inventory.\nNo "carry limit" on variety of different items in your inventory. (Although you are limited to 15 of each kind of item.)\nHerbs (which improve various character attributes) are located all over the world, and will re-spawn in the same places after a duration of time.\nChests can re-spawn once the required "boon" (perks for geographic regions of the game) is obtained\nGetting side-quests involves simply talking to your companion: Although you sometimes must talk to NPCs to get the sidequest, the NPCs are clearly marked on the mini-map and your companion drops reasonably good hints to where you need to go next. No bulletin-boards or guilds to travel to.\nCurrent main objective is shown on the map screen so you don't forget what to do.\nNo rediculously-difficult storyline bosses or enemies. If you get stuck, you can simlpy change the difficulty level in-game via the settings menu.\nKatz village!\nGRIPES: In-battle control is 97% responsive, and 3% quirks: 1) There are times the character doesn't "lock on" to run toward the targetted enemy as expected. 2) Pressing a direction immediately after targetting an enemy can inadvertently change the target. 3) There is an understandable delay between combos, BUT any button presses during that delay get ignored instead of queued. I got used to it, but having queued actions would've been nicer.\nThe in-game tutorial is provided for by large stone "monoliths" found throughout the world and in dungeons. The explanations that come from them (although funny at times) tend to be overly-elaborate and sometimes intimidating, despite the explained concepts being relatively simple.\nThe concepts behind the puzzles aren't really anything new.\nThe "skill sheet" is confusing, immensely frustrating to comprehend, infuriating to TRY to comprehend, and annoying when you finally learn it's not critical to building highly-capable characters.\nThere's one (and thankfully ONLY one) particular dungeon which isn't well explained, and the penalty for springing a trap is truly rage-quit worthy, controller-throwing and all. Not so bad once it's figured out, but up until then... ugh.\nNo mini-games or gambling houses.\nNo opportunity to develop a love-interest with another game character, and the main character is entirely ambiguous in this regard.\n"Petrify" status cannot be cured, PERIOD. :-(\nFast-travel can be prohibitively expensive.\nSTUPID CRASH BUG: If your system's audio sample-rate is set above 48000 Hz, Tales of Zestiria will crash on startup at the language-select menu. To fix, simply go into Sound > Properties > Advanced in Windows, and set the "Default Format" to 48000 Hz, either 16-bit or 24-bit...  but it's a really stupid bug no less.\nThe point of the "Normin" system was completely lost on me, and added yet more complexity I didn't care for. (Note: Even so, you should absolutely collect the Normins!)\nI found the ending just plain disappointing. Easy boss, long credits, and only a short bit of epilogue: IMO, it's not nearly what the characters nor memorable NPCs of this game deserved.","January 17","true","133.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Saya sendiri cukup menaruh ekspektasi besar pada seri ini.\n\nCerita (7/10)\nBercerita tentang Sorey, manusia yang dibesarkan oleh kaum seraphim. ToZ berpusat pada petualangan Sorey & para seraphim mengalahkan hellion yang disebabkan oleh malevolence dan sumber malevolence, Lord of Calamity.\n\nCerita ToZ sangat berpusat pada Sorey sebagai karakter utama, namun karakter Sorey sendiri terasa kurang di-explore. Hanya karakter Edna & Zaveid yang terasa begitu unik, selebihnya terlalu generic. Hubungan antar karakter pun minim konflik & emosi, pusat cerita ini hanya 1, bagaimana mengalahkan LoC.\n\nAlur plot yang terasa datar, tidak ada yang dapat membuat kita merasa excited kecuali saat menjelang akhir cerita.\n\nNamun di antara itu semua? Hal yang paling tidak bisa diterima sebagian besar fans adalah karakter Alisha yang begitu banyak dipromosikan lewat berbagai media, bahkan dijadikan anime, pada akhirnya akan meninggalkan party kita secara permanen di sekitar 10% awal progress cerita. Untuk apa? Cuma untuk menguatkan konsep cerita.\n\nSatu yang menarik adalah skit dialog yang muncul di saat2 tertentu yang dapat menutup plot hole pada cerita utama. Banyak scene yang bisa di-unlock setelah mengalahkan optional boss tertentu yang mampu menjelaskan sisi lain karakter & cerita pendukung. Beberapa cukup lucu dan menghibur, mengingat cerita utama ToZ cukup 'dark'.\n\nGrafis (6/10)\nToZ ini berasal dari port PS3 yang merupakan engine lama. Tidak ada yang luar biasa di sisi grafis.\n\nBerita 30 fps lock cukup membuat banyak orang tidak mau menghabiskan uang untuk beli game ini, apalagi kaum yang merasa game di pc 30 fps = bad port. Untungnya tak lama kemudian muncul ToZ fix yang membuat game ini dapat berjalan smooth pada 60 fps. Saya sendiri hampir selalu memainkan ToZ pada 30 fps & merasa ini bukan masalah.\n\nSatu2nya masalah ada pada kamera & point of view saat battle yang menyebalkan bahkan terkadang susah diatur.\n\nGameplay (8/10)\nBanyak sekali yang bisa kita explore di sisi gameplay.\nDari segi battle, berbeda dengan seri2 sebelumnya, dengan adanya konsep manusia & seraphim, kita bisa melakukan armatize yang merupakan penggabungan (fusion) manusia & seraphim. Stat kedua karakter akan dijumlahkan (HP, BG, Atk dll). Party terdiri atas 2 manusia & 2 seraphim, namun jika Sorey sendirian, maka hanya 1 seraphim yang bisa bertarung bersamanya.\n\nAdanya skill yang dipasangkan pada equipment (senjata, armor, aksesoris dll). Dengan menyusun skill tersebut menjadi G-Union, E-Union & Stack akan memberikan bonus skill yang dapat mengubah karakter dengan stat pas2an menjadi begitu overpowered, sehingga kita bisa menyusun strategi melawan boss tertentu dengan kombinasi skill yang tepat.","January 31","true","192.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Because there was a time where I got bored with it after like 8 hours and stopped touching it then I suddenly went back to it for another 50+ hours.\n\nNow. Was it fun? Hmm...I'd say yes. I did indeed have some fun with the game which is way I was able to play through the full story.\n\nUnfortunetely that was one of the reasons it fell short for me.  The story was really quite weak. It was a pretty generic chosen one affair.\n\nSome optional bosses gave me a feeling of challenge as you could juggle them pretty well but they could be monsterously hard hitters. Knocking my allies and me down with a single hit half of the time meaning that I had to get very, very comfortable with the defence and dodging mechanics which made beating them feel like an actual challenge and made victory all the sweeter.\n\nUnfortunetely I can't say the same for the story bosses. At all. In comparison they were expremely weak.\n\nBut those low points didn't hurt it enough  for me to not enjoy it enough to play.\n\nBut it does stop me from recommending it at full price.\n\nIf you get it on sale, go for it. It's a fun little thing\n\nOh! And for a final word I did REALLY enjoy a good number of the characters.

The gameplay is solid, and lets you slowly ramp up the difficulty by playing the highest available for a certain amount of time, until you find your sweet spot.\n\nYou can even turn it into practically a visual novel hybrid, as you can set the game to auto-play battles with suprising efficiency, so you can sit back and watch the action and enjoy the anime-esque banter.","May 13","true","169.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uzkniso/recommended/351970/","uzkniso","Uzkniso o.o","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uzkniso/","96 products in account","After just finishing the game, which took me 240+ hours, I thought I'll write a review.\n\nStory, plot, characters\nThe story is fairly generic. I mean, you're a hero, born for one single purpose - to fight evil.\nThere aren't that many plot twists and main character(s) are mostly teenagers.\nStill, I loved all of the main cast. The great part is that they all have strong personalities, and funny stuff happens when they clash. Expect to hear lots of funny convos. Serious ones, too.\nThere's sidequests too, which are pretty important. They aren't fetch quests. They are mostly "go beat that big bad monster" quests. They're important, because of their rewards. Seriously, you don't want to miss them!\n\nLeveling, loot, difficulty\nIt doesn't take long to level up characters and learn new skills. I am not entirely sure, but I think you will have all skills by the time you reach level 50, or around that level.\nIt might not seem like there's a lot of skills in the game, but I think it's a good amount.\nThing is, that if there were more of them, then the game might need a whole different system.\nThere's also titles, which give various bonuses to your character(s), which you unlock in various ways.\nLoot is hard to get, while you don't have drop rate boosts. Once you get those - it becomes a lot easier getting stuff, which you want.\nThere are also exp boosts, which you can get after finishing the game for the 1st time. It can go as high as 6 times the exp.\nMax level is 200 and getting there isn't hard, I would say, because I was still gaining levels at endgame. I finished the game at around level 136.\nThe last difficuly and the hardest one, is called "chaos". Unfortunately, it just increases monster level, damage, hp ... All that stuff. The monsters won't act any smarter, or whatever. They will just be more annoying. Fortunately, you can get the best loot in this difficulty, so it's worth fighting with this setting, if you can handle it.\nThe difficulty of the game depends on how well geared you are. I had a lot of things on +99, so I managed to beat the final boss on chaos difficulty.\n\nSummary in Pros + and Cons - format\n+ Nice art, anime-style movies\n+ Interesting story, just not one-of-a-kind\n+ Interesting characters, all with their bright personallities\n+ Good skill and leveling system\n+ Each weapon features unique design\n+ Nice selection of difficulty settings\n+ Lots of boss monsters, all with different behaviors\n+ Interesting and new "Lords of the Land" system\n+ New game plus option with lots of cool features\n\n- If you want to get great gear with +99 fusion and 3x skills, then prepare to grind. A LOT.\n- Linear story-telling might not appeal to some\n- While you progress thru the story, some areas get locked out and you can't backtrack, for some time\n- The ally AI might be hard to get used to, and setting it up might take some time\n- The battle camera will annoy you, when you will fight in tight spaces\n\nWorth buying?\nIt's worth buying, if:\n\n- you're looking for a new experience. I would say, that, not many games offer such an experience amongst current steam games\n- you like anime","December 17, 2015","true","499.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/recommended/351970/","poopybutts","Andem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/","618 products in account","if you like JRPGs, this game takes the flaws of the genre and multiplies them by 2. There is ENDLESS dialogue for hours and it is not interesting. Most of it is just explaining what you just heard over and over. The characters are absolutely boring. The story is the laziest I've ever seen. There is "malevolence" in the world and you have to cleanse it. Malevolence is literally just evil. No one is held accountable for their own actions because if they do anything bad, it was just malevolence. There are humans and Seraphim, but Seraphim are just humans with some powers that humans can't see and apparently can never do anything wrong and it's always the human's fault.\n\nFor a game about saving the world and being heroes, the characters are all strangely judgemental and elitist. There was a horrible sidequest about following some stupid kids around (which is literally just walking around a small town and listening to 10 minutes of cutscene and barely any animation) and seeing if they're stealing from people because someone told them to. It turns out they were just stealing because they were!! So the game gives you an option. Send them to the knights and imprison them?? Or not?? I chose not to. So apparently that means going up to the kids and saying how evil they are. The kids are like "YEAH SO WHAT WE HAVE NO WAY OF FEEDING OURSELVES" and then the main characters just call the god damn knights any way and send them to a prison or whatever. These characters have no real empathy and don't seem to know how to react like even KIND OF normal human beings to situations.\n\nOkay, so the story sucks, the characters suck, what about the gameplay? I could have let it off the hook, but no, the camera is the absolute worst I've ever seen. Especially if you are playing in multiplayer. I mean it when I say I've never seen a worse camera in a video game. It gets STUCK inside walls, as in you cannot move it out, and you are very often looking at a twitching mess staring at a monsters ♥♥♥. Nintendo 64 games had set up better cameras for 3D\n\nNot only with the camera, but the game rewards you for spamming. I know, I know, a lot of the other Tales games rewarded you for it as well, but this one takes it to a new level. All you do is armatize (basically fuse with a party member) and you will be put in a super form with MUCH much less moves. With almost every form, its best to just spam the spell casting abilities. They do absolutely huge damage and huge AOE and constantly stun the bosses and monsters. Sure, you could try just not doing that, right? But then you're at a huge disadvantage. The monsters tend to flinch way less, most of your moves are not very big aoes, and just are not very strong in general. Basically, every battle goes like this. See what weakness it has. Armatize to that weakness. Then just press your strongest spell over and over till the battle is done. Try to do it without armatizing, and its gonna take a lot longer or just not even be possible. It's just not balanced at all.\n\nI haven't even gotten to the dungeon design. Oh the dungeon design is so, soooooo lazy. Most of it is just completely empty hallways with copy pasted rooms that have absolutely no detail in them. You'll go through caves that look exactly the same, except this cave is blue. You'll go through dungeons and find yourself getting lost because every room looks exactly the same and you have no landmarks to look to. There is absolutely no excuse for this. Previous tales of games, (vesperia, abyss, even symphonia) had better design and better puzzles. I'm not saying the previous games puzzles and dungeons were great, but the fact that this game somehow is WORSE than those is just sad. You're supposed to improve upon your games, not downgrade.\n\nOh, lets also not forget to mention the tons of worthless DLC. DLC costumes for a single player game. Beach costumes, that you used to just unlock in the old games for free, are now 7 dollars. A lot of it was just flat out day 1 DLC as well.\n\nOverall, as a fan of the olderish Tales games like Symphonia, Abyss (well I didn't hate it at least) and Vesperia, this game is just a huge disappointment. I wasn't expecting much from it honestly, and it still somehow turned out worse than I thought. This game is just a soulless, lazy, and greedy cash grab. There was no heart put into this, no effort. They just wanted to make money and pump out a Tales game as fast as possible.\n\nTL;DR. It's boring and bad. Even if you're a fan of tales games and JRPGS, find something better. Even the positive reviews for this game say it's the weakest game of the series so that must be saying something.","November 14, 2015","false","36.3"," 81 of 153 people (53%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","53","81","153","10","6"

(Upon playing 50 hours. It's not extremely deep, but fun)\n\nThe flaws to this game is mainly the lack of replayability and decisions.\n\nThis game constantly has NPC's say.. "Choose, do this or this"\nYou'd think this would mean you can make a decision that effects the story, but no.\nYour character makes that decision on his own. The developers basically mocking you with the fact that there's a decision, but it means jack ♥♥♥♥ to you.\n\nIn the first 50% of the game, there is only ONE decision YOU can make. That your character doesn't make for you.\nThis decision to either build a bridge and night, or day.\nIf you build it at day, people look at you funny for being so powerful, then the same cutscene plays from if you built it at midnight exactly.\nThis decision effects nothing ingame.\n\nYou can argue that the game isn't about decisions, but then the game shouldn't clearly represent a decision to you as if thay planned to add ingame decisions, but rushed it out instead of making the decisions actually be in the game. None of the other Tales of games gave you these fake, illusions of decisions. It's only this game and it's horrible.\n\nNOW. To anyone who says "This game isn't about decisions, yada yada yada"\n\nThe game CLEARLY makes it apear you are making decisions. The game clearly depicts choice and that your character needs to choose to do something, how ever you don't get to make the decision at all. This is probably due to a rushed game. Why else would NPC's literally tell you to decide between two options CONSTANTLY, only to have there not be a real choice.\n\nThere was one decision in the entire game, fix a bridge at night or day (Keeping spoilers out of this) Literally, choosing to do it right away in daylight adds 3 seconds to a cutscene. The same cutscene you'd see at night with different lighting. The end.\n\nThis game is fun, but disappoint as all hell with decisions MOCKING you with their existence, not allowing your input on what happens.\n\nI will also bring up a very random sidenote.\n\nThe 3d models ingame are often hit or miss. The main protaganists walk animation makes him look extremely constipated. (Look it up, you'll have a really good laugh)\n\nThe main character is easily the worst model in the game.\n\nThe 3d models of npc's all over the game aren't animated. In cities there are 100's of npcs that dont even have idle or breathing animations. They are dolls.","November 5, 2015","false","50.3"," 41 of 76 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","41","76","4","4"

I don't fully get the negative reviews for this game. This game has some pretty good humour, both from skits and ingame happenings. That's something that I don't see that much in any other Tales game I played before. The battle system is great, as you can switch out characters during battle. Previously you would likely choose your 4 favourite characters and left the rest to rot in the party, now you can use all of them swiftly, so no obsolete characters.

It is a good solid game although I would have liked to wait for it to go down in price, I don't think it is worth a new game price.\n\nI have played a few of the Tales games, although by no means all of them, and I enjoy the series. This game mostly lived up to its name, although it feels like it is diverging a little from its original formula. It feels a lot darker and more political than the others, although all Tales games have an edge to them. There is a lot more running around collecting things and backtracking, some of which can get repetitive, where the others have felt a lot more linear up until the end. However, it is still as epic and story driven as the others. The music is okay but some of it felt too ambient and subtle, where I prefer more traditional JRPG music (a problem I also had with Graces at times). The battle system is mostly the same sort of thing but felt a little more awkward than the previous games. Strangely, I found this game easier to control with a keyboard and mouse than a gamepad, despite it being from a long line of console RPGs. The button mashing feels smoother with a mouse. Then again, the series is slowly changing anyway and at least they kept a lot of the important things, like the Katz!\n\n","April 14","true","55.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is a tough one.  This is a solid RPG no doubt, with some really interesting characters, and decent combat.  But in no way does this game compare to some of the Tales games that came before it.  Here are the Tales games I beat prior to this:\n\nTales of Legendia\nTales of Symphonia\nTales of Vesperia\nTales of Graces F\n\nSo what are the issues?  Let's start with the camera angle in battles.  This can be absolutely annoying sometimes because you might not even be able to see Sorey or anything at all.  Second the final boss, phase 2, seems a lot on the cheap side, and warrants the cheap way you're going to beat him.  Also the dungeons are very basic, the puzzles are non existent mostly.  Lastly the story is weak.  I mean there's elements that are interesting, but where other Tales games really excel at story telling, this one is pretty plain.\n\nI still recommend.  It's a good game, but not a great game.","May 13","true","62.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game has quite a bit of content, still only on my second playthrough. Between leveling lords of the land, improving my relationship with shop and innkeepers I'm kept pretty busy, let's not forget the insanity chaos mode brings. While the game is interesting plotwise the first time around it can get repetitive on a second run, well even the first run can too, since you get abilities later in game to help you overcome obstacles in older dungeons, even backtracking in quite a few cases.\n\nThat being said theres plenty to keep you busy, I personally loved the skits (especially Edna and Meebo) the fusion system is a bit tricky to grasp at first but you can find guides online, (Also fixes for things like the 30 fps lock) I can't be bothered to do that myself though.\n\nThe only things I'm inconvienced by are the camera angles sometimes in dungeons, and the fact I have to see tutorial messages after my second playthrough. other than that I have quite a blast with Sorey the demon lord and his demonically dressed minions Seraph friends. I love the fashion system.\n\n\n\n\n\ncouple of tips if you get this\n\n- use free & free under battle options so you can move around any direction during a fight.\n\n- before you do new game+ get lords of the land as high as you can, typically 3-4k grade wise on the ng+ page to get all\nthe glorious boons for your second playthrough. It's a huge difference.\n\n- don't throw away the 10 damage/armor joke items, You can carry them over when you sanctify with boons.\n\n- There is a Alisha DLC after you beat the game. Along with a bonus dungeon before the final boss only appears after game completion.\n\n\nThis game is probably best to pick up on a sale, although I don't regret purchasing it at full price, my first tales game but a great experience. (except for the damn water trial) I hate that one oh so much.","May 12","true","135.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Being a JRPG fan, I was afraid the game would be too short or have other types of limitations. Quickly finding myself proven otherwise, I was really stoked at what the game had in store.\n\n+ Overall a great PC port. Very much playable with keyboard and mouse, though I use my 360 controller out of preference.\n+ A decent storyline that is not too overly complicated to follow. It's nothing spectacular or groundbreaking, though it was engaging enough to keep me playing.\n+ The characters are also really good, maybe somewhat static at times but I enjoyed them. They were what made the story keep flowing as well as it did. The interactions between them are really nice as well.\n+ A pleasant cell shaded artstyle that's quite easy on the eyes. Personally, I really loved it as the anime fan I am. Some places look really good, and I loved exploring caves and forests alike.\n+ An astonishing soundtrack. Sometimes, I found myself walking around without doing much progress just to listen to the music. That's not to speak about the trial dungeons, which I find to be exceptional. The OP too. Just remember to patch in the version with vocals.\n+ Solid gameplay, the combat is superb and rightly so as it's what made the game for me. However, the combat might not be for everyone. Look up some gameplay of it.\n+ Good replayability due to the skill system, I'll probably play through the game again on some higher difficulty to try some different options, but I don't think that's necessary to get the full experience.\n+ It's... Very long. Over a hundred hours and I've yet to beat the game, though I assume that's because I'm a tortoise when it comes to gaming. It wouldn't surprise me if you could beat it in 50h or so, probably less.\n\n- Camera in combat can be a bit clunky sometimes, especially in tight corridors.\n- The "open world" is somewhat lacking. You will find yourself running through empty large spaces quite often unless you want to spend money on fast travelling.\n- Level design could've been better. They look good, but are quite linear and don’t give much room for exploration as the map is fully lit and shows you where to go.\n- Minor occasional framedrops during combat.\n- The skill system is really complex, especially the forging part of it and knowing which skill is better for each character etc. After so long of playing, I'm still not completely sure how to properly craft the type of equipment I want.\n- Prepare to be bombarded with seemingly endless amounts of tutorials.\n\nTo sum it up, I can't say anything else but that I recommend this game. Everything just blends so well together and I found that the pros made me forget about the cons almost completely. I mean, who cares about crafting properly as long as you're having fun, right? I suppose one of the main things people will wonder about is the price, and yes, I can definitely say that it's worth it at full price. 49.99€ was a good deal as I got Symphonia as an added bonus, but even without that I personally think it's worth it. If you're still unsure, it might go on sale eventually.","November 15, 2015","true","153.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I don't think I've ever been so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at camera in any game before.\n- Overly complex equipment upgrade system. Even if you understand how it works it still requires way too much micromanagement and memorization.\n- Situationally unaware companion AI.

It's very dull and lacks atmosphere and memorable places.\n- Side characters don't get almost any screen time and antagonists are easily the worst in the series.\n\nVerdict: It's still better than Dawn of the New World and Xillia 2.

The animations, character details and anime cutscenes are great, and smooth even at 30fps, framerate shouldn't be a problem. There is room for improvement for the environmental objects though.\n\nStory\n\nDefinitely not a strong point of this game. The story is quite plain and predictable, even though tales series games are usually more character-driven, they are just OK in this game. If you are not familiar with JRPG games you may find the story and/or characters unbearable even.\n\nGameplay\n\nI finished the game (and ALL sidequests) in 70 hours. However if you would like to collect things and be a completionist you'd definitely need more than that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UpcomingDread/recommended/351970/","UpcomingDread","Maintain3d","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UpcomingDread/","113 products in account","WARNING SPOILERS\n\nGood game with enjoyable characters and fun yet tricky to master combat. On the downside the story was sort of all over the place and there was a serious lack in villians. Also I know the game is suppose to be about exploring ruins but come on every dungeon besides the trials looked the same and were a real bore to run through.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nCombat was a big plus though; being able to switch in and out Seraphims, while switching between characters on the fly is a blast which allows you to takes control of all six characters in a single fight (though you do need to unlock the battle skills first). the AI is pretty wonky like most Tales of games making it so switching between Sorey and Rose using the block + directional buttons a must unless you like seeing Rose get 1 shot in every boss fight. You can easily save Seraphims by switching them out to dodge attacks. The only real negative points I would give to the combat is camera getting stuck on walls/invisable walls and all the invinciblily frames on bosses where you can't damage them making you wait for whatever animation they are doing to end. If they wanted to give the bosses some breathing room I would suggest an instant knockback move or something.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nCharacters were a lot of fun always joking around and throwing out puns left and right. I really enjoyed the group talking about each enemy they encountered. Even Alisha the princess knight who wasn't in the group very long was very likable to bad for her she lost her lead role to Rose an essentric assassin who is creeped out by supernatural stuff (for little while at least). It really is a insane group of characters, with Lailah spouting nonesense, Edna teasing Mikleo and Mikleo overreacting, Dezel talking to animals or giving facts about wildlife, or Zaveid... being Zaveid you'd think they'd give Sorey something to stand out more besides geeking out on ruins with Mikleo.\n\nSTORY\n\nStory can get random, Sorey can't see Seraphims cuz Heldalf said so, and so the now invisible Seraphim to Sorey no longer help him because they don't like being ignored or they were tired idk, Rose was gonna get married (Haha what!?) and Dezel somehow causes the person she was gonna marry to turn into a hellion just because it adds drama, and how about Mikleo being a Seraphim? Did the last Shepherd kill his baby nephew or was it son? Wait did the last Shepherd marry his sister Muse? Guh I feel like they glanced over a lot of parts like that while saying, "What was that? Plot holes? Pshh why fill those in when we could mold the dirt into forgetful boss fights!" Seriously would of liked to see more villians or at least the 3 villians they gave us more often... Come on crazy fox guy you see at the beggining then end, creepy girl is middle then end, I'm not even going to count Alisha's teacher Maltran as a villian cuz you see her like 2 times and suddenly she is a villian which you don't really care about cuz you've only seen her TWICE, and Heldalf is always just standing around letting his purple stench spread all over while I guess he is thinking about what he is going to have for dinner? I'm not saying there weren't any good scenes between the cast and villians i'm just saying interacting with them more instead of a random hellion would of been nice.\n\nOverall Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n-Characters\n-Combat\n-Japanese Audio\n-Equipment System\n-Music\n\nCons:\n-Fox dude wtf is his deal?\n-75% of dungeons look like the same ruin or cave with differen't colors\n-Swimsuits as DLC (Whatever happened to there being hotsprings for this? I thought that was gonna be a thing... this time it was just a random skit...)\n-Boss invincibility frames\n\nEh:\n-Story had it's moments\n-Open maps looked nice but I didn't exactly have fun trudging across them\n-Sorey x Mikleo dat ending\n-Alisha leaving kind of a bummer, I really liked her in skits\n-English dub on my NG+ right now and Mikleo's voice is a little jarring, but I might get use to it\n\nI recommend it to JRPG fans although veterans of the Tales of series MIGHT walk away a little dissapointed.","November 1, 2015","true","79.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's only a little bit of stuttering with maxed out settings. All-in-all it's a very good first port of a Tales series to PC. It follows the Tales formula of innocent youth facing a harsh world that was popularised in Tales of Symphonia and overcoming adversity with the power of friendship (though not Tales of Graces f "FRIENDSHIP"). The characters are written very well and feel like they could be real people facing the struggles within the game.\n\nPros:\nConstant frame rate in battle. There have been no dropped frames inside battles.\nThere is different AI patterns based off of difficulty. I noticed this when I was fighting a certain boss earlier in the game. His attack patterns were more stragetic in trying to stagger me instead of just trying to attack through my combos.\nHumorous dialogue. A lot of the skits have been localised fairly well and feel like they keep the original tone.\nCons:\n30 FPS lock. Before this review is obliterated by the dislike button hear me out. There's noticeable input lag when trying to do big combos during the game. There are times where a combo should have been fired off but it winds up not happening because the input was received on the wrong frame. It is jarring to have this happen repeatedly in a fight where you need to be able to stun-lock/combo-lock your opponent. I really do hope that Tales of Symphonia on PC is not just a direct port of the PS3 version which is similarly locked at 30 FPS.\nLevel pacing. This may just be me playing on Moderate/Hard on my first playthrough but there is a crushing level spike with every new area. Where most of the level spike can be off-put by mastering the dodge system and having a lot of Battle Skills active, the level spikes make it feel like grinding is the answer to a lot of the progression problems.","October 31, 2015","true","103.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Robotlegs/recommended/351970/","Robotlegs","Robotlegs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Robotlegs/","105 products in account","TL;DR This game is amazing. It's fluid, engaging, funny, challenging, and has a great story to back it up. All the little things you can find around while you're exploring really bring you to grasp with the history of the game. 8/10. If $50 is worth well over 100 hours of quality gameplay to you, do yourself a favor and buy it!\n\nOk, so let's get some things straight.\n\nNegatives:\nStill not as awesome as Tales of Symphonia. Don't get me wrong, the story for Zestiria was epic, but Symphonia set the standards way high. You wonder why they're putting Symphonia into steam? Because it's LEGENDARY (and they're going to make LOADS of money off of it). Since it's still fantastic, not taking any points off.\nThe camera angles in combat kinda suck. Once you have something targeted, the camera likes to zoom all the way in so you can't see the rest of the fight, leaving it to hope your allies don't get rekt by monsters you can't see. I'd imagine this would be rectified if you had two people playing the game, so I won't take a point off for this.\nYou'll probably get angry at the story at some point.\nCharacter attachment vs. plot writer's intentions. THIS is directly responsible for taking 2 points off the review. My reasoning for this is in this spoiler, and it really is a spoiler, which is a huge shame because I wish I could tell people ahead of time so it doesn't bother them as much as it did myself. Read ONLY if you both do not care about spoilers and this is the deciding factor of you playing it:  A lot of people complained about the situation with Alisha due to DLC matters. However, that's not my gripe since they made the DLC free after people complained. My issue is that Alisha was a FAR less annoying and more emotionally engaging heroine character than Rose. Yeah, the justification makes sense. Alisha couldn't armatize, making her inherently weaker, and Sorey's attempt to make her see the seraphim through making her his squire required too much from his body, causing him to start to go blind or blank out. And the speed at which she was ejected from the storyline is staggering. Yeah, the party needed to go to the Rolance empire, and having royalty of the enemy in the party probably wouldn't do Sorey much good. I just think they should have done more to accomodate her into the story, because it almost seems as if Sorey and the other seraphim completely forget about her, which is b******t since she is a far more emotionally attached character than Rose ever was or will be. Alisha was the first human for Sorey to meet and have human interaction with, she introduced them into the world below, she was directly responsible for facilitating Sorey becoming the shepherd, and there's clear emotional ties between the two. I couldn't believe how much they totally f*****g ignored her existence until the very end when they finally realized they didn't write her into the story, skits, commentary, NOTHING AT ALL after your trip to the Rolance empire.\n\nThe story had much more potential, even though it was already great.\n\nOh, and did I say that Rose was annoying? *sigh*\n(more) Positives:\nThe art design is fantastic.\nThe characters are varied and interesting.\nCombat can get really cool and has fluid progression, making you notice yourself getting stronger.\nSO many things to find. Really, the game will have you pass through a cave (several times), and it shows you a straight shot route to your destination, but you have the option to go explore it, yielding phat lewt and interesting encounters.\nReplayability.\nBacktracking to areas previously visited isn't totally useless! You can revisit most areas to open things you previously couldn't, and there's a system for buffing monsters in weaker areas to both make them more difficult and drop loot with specific properties.\nThe really cool stuff in the game that's relatively easy to enact isn't godmode, and sometimes you're better off not using them. Knowing the enemy will take you further than anything else.\nIt's a Tales game.\nThe DLC is completely cosmetic, and the one that's not can be obtained in-game via "New Game+"\nSpeaking of cosmetics, there's a lot of cosmetic items in the game that you can find and customize the looks of your characters with if you are willing to seek them out (they are usually fairly well hidden).\nThe game rewards you with plenty of really great skits for the most random things. These skits are much better quality than in other tales games, are fully voiced over, and are generally extremely funny. This is good, since the gravity of the situation you're stuck in would be hella depressing otherwise.\n\nSeriously, you read this entire review? Go buy it already!","December 15, 2015","true","40.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unavailablelink/recommended/351970/","unavailablelink","Gulfoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unavailablelink/","44 products in account","After finishing the game I've decided to put in additional thoughts and provide the perspective of someone who hasn't played any other recent Tales games. I didn't expect a lot about the game and by all means I enjoyed it, some points in this review people might disagree since some of them expects a lot and so on. Nevertheless, here are my thoughts:\n\n+Deep battle system, it does not encourage you to just mash buttons on your way to victory, which is true if you're playing in higher difficulties.\n+Skits are very entertaining and always a thing I look forward to.\n+Lots of character development among the main characters of the game and everyone is likeable in terms of personality. Some secondary characters also provided a huge part in the story.\n+Difficulty system rewards you with better drops and allows you to learn the battle system much faster.\n+There's still post game content once you've finished the game and lots of stuff gets unlocked once you start NG+\n+The music of the game was spectacular, mostly the music inside the trials.\n\n~ I'd stay neutral story-wise as it is a subjective matter on how you take the game, it feels lacking at some point on some characters but other than that it all made sense to me.\n\n- Equipment system is too complex and grindy. If you want to maximize the potential of the system, you need to grind a lot and I find it hard to maximize everything in your first playthrough it would be better if you try to maximize it on subsequent playthroughs.\n- Unless you're really good, some, if not most, battles forces you to use armatization since some monsters/bosses can kill your characters pretty easy. This happens most of the time on higher difficulties (Intense, Chaos) since the level of the enemies grow a lot and damage potential is increased.\n- Armatization can be abused to the point a battle can be very cheap. i.e. spamming a seraphic arte over and over until the enemies die.\n- Camera during battles becomes awkward when fighting in small corners as the camera gets zoomed in a lot to the point you can't see anything. A slight fix would be to use the "Free Walk" button to be able to see your character.\n- The AI of your allies doesn't really help you much in battle, yes, they die a lot for no reason. I find this very frustrating on some boss fights, even on some random encounters, since they tend to target your allies a lot or cast huge spells which your allies just tank. They also tend to split from armatization then die immediately afterwards even if you try to armatize them. In order to alleviate this, you have to micromanage everyone during fights to minimize the deaths and hope that they don't mess up everytime you switch into another character.\n\nGreat overall game, which you can play at your own pace (which I did), I finished my first playthrough by finishing all the sidequests and doing what I can to improve my equipment.","January 18","true","122.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since I've been playing for 3 days and put 20+ hrs into I can say these things:\n\nStoryline 8/10\nI hear alot of negatives about the story line. I don't get why they don't like it. I find the story pretty good. Of course alot of reviews are from those who have played the other gaems in the series. Since this is my firest time playing the Tales OF series and a JRPG type of game I guess I don't get what they mean. I give it 8/10 cuz at some points in the game I lost track of some of the story, of I'm still playing.\n\nCombat 9/10\nI like the combat system it reminds me of Quest 64. I give it 9/10 beacuase man, if you understand right away good for you. But for me, after 20hrs of gameplay I'm still just press random keys lol. You have to puit some time into learning the system to get the right combos and all that.\n\nGraphics 10/10\nI'm pretty much gonna have to say it, but it's nothing special but I give it 10/10 becasus the detail is nice, You can see pretty far away, and I like the animated look of the game. Just don't expect anything close to Fallout 4 graphics if you buy the game.\n\nAnyway, I'd recommend it. I'll just say, the closest game that I've play that this game also reminds me of is FLYFF (Fly for Fun) which is also a great MMORPG and I'd recommend that too.","November 19, 2015","true","40.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Bosses are much easier than alphas(they are monsters in each area that are much more powerfull than the other monsters in the area, only one of them stands in each area )\nBut despite all of this, this game is actually fun, feels nostalgic, has an anime style (which I like a lot).","November 19, 2015","true","51.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's my first Tales game, and it was very fun. I liked the combat, some of the story, the characters, the presentation, and I wasl satisfied with it. I also disliked the stat-system, a lot more of the story, the first-impressions of most characters, the vast, empty-except-for-monsters overworld, and a cople of nitpicks\n\nThe combat system is very, very fun. It's real-time in a small area, and there's a lot of good about it. Your "martial arts" will be your normal attacks, comboing into themselves and coming out quickly. "Hidden arts" sometimes combo into martial arts, sometimes finish combos, or just be stand-alone attacks depending on when and where you use them. They wont be interrupted by martial arts, but the same goes for enemy hidden arts. "Seraphic arts" are charged magical attacks, getting bigger and better and taking more time to charge as they advance. Mixing these up and killing all your enemies is fun, although good luck stringing together constant combos with the AI. Still, I took on the hardest boss in the entire game (Who, by the way, is a side-quest boss) while I was thirty levels under him. It took me a couple of tries, but the combat was so satisfying that I was ok with it.\n\nThe problem with the combat system is the stat system. Equipment changes in each area, becoming better as you go along. Unfortunately, it also doesn't. Each piece of equipment comes with up to four skills, the first of which is constant throughout across all other pieces with that name. Since all these akills are randomized, it tries to fuse linear and non-linear gear together, to terrible effect. There may be a set of skills for each tier of equipment, but I got so fed up with the system that by the end I wasn't really paying attention. It's an overly-complicated system that I ignored, and the game didn't punish me for it.\n\nAnother problem is with grinding. You don't actually have to grind much in this game, but you might want to just to make future bosses easier. I tried grinding a bit, but the enemies didn't seem advance with their levels when I raised the overall level of the area. It's not terrible, but I wish that there had been a more noticeable effect.\n\nThe music was pretty good, although not the greatest. It's good enough for long hours of playing, but not "soundtrack-of-my-life" levels of good. I also just liked the visuals in general, but the effect has worn off after... 75 hours? Where did my life go? Anyway, still one of the better looking games I've played in my life.\n\nNow comes to the most important part of ny JRPG: the story. After 75 hours, I've decided that I kinda liked it. There's a lot of things that it does very well, some that I would normally face-palm at. There's a character focused entirely on puns, most characters are just fun and likeable. For reference, there's a group of "good assassins" in the story. Naturally I thought that that's kinda stupid and contrived. It's now one of my favorite points in the story. Unfortuantely, it's fairly average as stories go, and that's WHEN I did like it.\n\nI may like the story and the characters, but if I had anything else to play at the time I probably would have stopped before the one-hour mark-- If the cutcenes were finally done at that point. For a long time the characters are just stupid and cliche and there si still a 10% chance that I like this story out of Stockholme's syndrome. For far too long, Sorey is "A wide-eyed, naive boy who's just learning about the real world, but keeping his chin up". Mikleo is "Sorey's best friend / Brother in all but blood, who always complains but always stands by his friend". The first time you meet most charaters, they are unbelievably cliche, and the main villain is essentially "The Darkness that lies in everyone's heart, mwahahahahaa". Eventually the characters become likeable, and the story picks up a sort-of theme about deciding taking your life's meaning and purpose into your own hands, but damn does it take it's sweet time getting there, and even then there are times when it's not that great. It's simplistic, somewhat cliche, and only saved by the combat.\n\nRants aside, I still liked this game. I pre-ordered it because it was bundled with a future key for Tales of Symphonia when it re-releases in 2016, and I've heard nothing but good about that game. I also got some extra costumes, which I like but could live without. Overall I'd reccomend this game, but over the Christmas sale when it is (hopefully) under $30. Until then, only Symphonia could justfy that price-tag in my mind.","November 28, 2015","true","75.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For anyone else, if you're looking for effective story moments with likeable characters, satisfying battle mechanics and a vast world full of content to explore without minding some cheese and repetition, then you'll enjoy this game. The story in the Tales franchise never comes down to black and white, and while Zestiria doesn't really shine in the plot or the character department as well as some other Tales games, it does have some genuinely touchy moments as well as humorous ones through its course in common Tales fashion. The artstyle is also clean and vibrant, and the animated cutscenes by Ufotable are pleasing to watch.\n\nThe battle mechanics are a positive trademark of the Tales franchise, focusing on fast, action based real time combat that revolves around evading attacks and locking the opponents into combos by exploiting their weaknesses. It's easy to get into and hard to master, starting out extremely simple and then giving you more and more to work with, although you can also simply transform into a different form and murder everything without that much thought. Battle mechanics have been done better in a couple other Tales games, but Zestiria is still good at creating a system where skill plays a considerable enough role and beating bosses doesn't always have to come down to more grinding. There are also 5 different difficulty settings to work with starting out with 3, with harder difficulties yielding better drops.\n\nAs for the equipment system, you have 5 equipment slots with every equipment having 4 skill slots, and there are a total of 50 skills in this game that you can stack or combine in specific ways to create bonus effects. You get the skills you want by fusing copies of the same gear together, but getting those copies of gear with the specific skills you want before the fusion process is based too heavily on RNG and ends up being way more trouble than it's worth, so for the most part you'll just end up ignoring this whole mechanic, and fortunately it isn't needed in any way to make progress even on harder difficulties. Still, it's an unsatisfying aspect that will hopefully be executed better in the future, as it is a neat idea.\n\nThe world is split into several open overworld sections, towns, dungeons and fight arenas, with unique discovery points, collectibles and optional boss monsters to find in each separate area. The fight arenas are an exception however, as they seem to be designed mostly for equipment grinding. While there's a vast number of optional dungeons, they can be quite repetitive as they're all very similar with each other. Most of the main story related dungeons are fine though unless you're specificaly looking for clever design or complex puzzles, as there won't be much of that here.\n\nNew Game+ system is something that the franchise likes to give attention to, letting you earn points called Grade on your playthrough that you can use to buy bonuses and special traits for your next playthrough. Zestiria game has a new approach to this, letting you acquire guardian spirits called Lords of the Land for each town which you can then level up through battle performance and by offering them items, and the Grade you get after your playthrough is based on their levels. This process also unlocks other advantages, making it an interesting system, although one confusing aspect about it is  that the points used for leveling up the spirits are also called Grade despite having nothing to do with the actual Grade you get for NG+ bonus purchases.\n\nWhile Zestiria falls a bit short of where some other Tales games have set the bar, it's ultimately a good game if viewed as a standalone and as such I can recommend it to any RPG fan.","January 8","true","109.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowRFox/recommended/351970/","ShadowRFox","ShadowRFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowRFox/","225 products in account","This was my first full playthrough of a "Tales" game. I've played some Tales of Symphonia but never the whole game. I know a lot of fans of the "Tales" find Zestiria to be the low point of the series, but I found it quite enjoyable.\n\nThe story is about a world that has been plunged into chaos and darkness due to a lack of Shepherd. Not to be confused with Commander Shepherd from Mass Effect, although that would have made the game more interesting. Shepherds are people who can interact with beings known as Seraphs and purify evil beings known as Hellions. Basically they're the peacekeeper between humans and mythical things. You take control of Sorey, the new Shepherd, as he travel the land gaining Seraphs to help him to end the era of chaos. The story is fairly entertaining, although it can be a little slow to start off, but it start to pick up around the middle point.\n\nThe game play involve moving across a 3D open world. As you move across the map you will see enemies roaming about  and if you run into one you get put into battle scene. Basically in a battle, a small boundary is placed around the player and 4 of his party members until the enemies are defeated. The combat is a hack and slash, but with the gimmick of being able to merge with party members to use stronger attacks. Their are elements in this game, so as you can guess there is a rock-paper-scissor system in place for what type of attacks enemies are weak against. Combat feel good although just watch what level you and your party are. If you're too low then you'll find some enemies beating the tar out of you, but if you're too high then you'll find you're beating the tar out of the final boss.\n\nThe music felt right although don't try to ask me to remember any particular tracks, it just kinda blended into the background for me. The character english voices wasn't too bad (I've heard some horrible dubs before).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Robotlegs/recommended/351970/","Robotlegs","Robotlegs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Robotlegs/","105 products in account","TL;DR This game is amazing. It's fluid, engaging, funny, challenging, and has a great story to back it up. All the little things you can find around while you're exploring really bring you to grasp with the history of the game. 8/10. If $50 is worth well over 100 hours of quality gameplay to you, do yourself a favor and buy it!\n\nOk, so let's get some things straight.\n\nNegatives:\nStill not as awesome as Tales of Symphonia. Don't get me wrong, the story for Zestiria was epic, but Symphonia set the standards way high. You wonder why they're putting Symphonia into steam? Because it's LEGENDARY (and they're going to make LOADS of money off of it). Since it's still fantastic, not taking any points off.\nThe camera angles in combat kinda suck. Once you have something targeted, the camera likes to zoom all the way in so you can't see the rest of the fight, leaving it to hope your allies don't get rekt by monsters you can't see. I'd imagine this would be rectified if you had two people playing the game, so I won't take a point off for this.\nYou'll probably get angry at the story at some point.\nCharacter attachment vs. plot writer's intentions. THIS is directly responsible for taking 2 points off the review. My reasoning for this is in this spoiler, and it really is a spoiler, which is a huge shame because I wish I could tell people ahead of time so it doesn't bother them as much as it did myself. Read ONLY if you both do not care about spoilers and this is the deciding factor of you playing it:  A lot of people complained about the situation with Alisha due to DLC matters. However, that's not my gripe since they made the DLC free after people complained. My issue is that Alisha was a FAR less annoying and more emotionally engaging heroine character than Rose. Yeah, the justification makes sense. Alisha couldn't armatize, making her inherently weaker, and Sorey's attempt to make her see the seraphim through making her his squire required too much from his body, causing him to start to go blind or blank out. And the speed at which she was ejected from the storyline is staggering. Yeah, the party needed to go to the Rolance empire, and having royalty of the enemy in the party probably wouldn't do Sorey much good. I just think they should have done more to accomodate her into the story, because it almost seems as if Sorey and the other seraphim completely forget about her, which is b******t since she is a far more emotionally attached character than Rose ever was or will be. Alisha was the first human for Sorey to meet and have human interaction with, she introduced them into the world below, she was directly responsible for facilitating Sorey becoming the shepherd, and there's clear emotional ties between the two. I couldn't believe how much they totally f*****g ignored her existence until the very end when they finally realized they didn't write her into the story, skits, commentary, NOTHING AT ALL after your trip to the Rolance empire.\n\nThe story had much more potential, even though it was already great.\n\nOh, and did I say that Rose was annoying? *sigh*\n(more) Positives:\nThe art design is fantastic.\nThe characters are varied and interesting.\nCombat can get really cool and has fluid progression, making you notice yourself getting stronger.\nSO many things to find. Really, the game will have you pass through a cave (several times), and it shows you a straight shot route to your destination, but you have the option to go explore it, yielding phat lewt and interesting encounters.\nReplayability.\nBacktracking to areas previously visited isn't totally useless! You can revisit most areas to open things you previously couldn't, and there's a system for buffing monsters in weaker areas to both make them more difficult and drop loot with specific properties.\nThe really cool stuff in the game that's relatively easy to enact isn't godmode, and sometimes you're better off not using them. Knowing the enemy will take you further than anything else.\nIt's a Tales game.\nThe DLC is completely cosmetic, and the one that's not can be obtained in-game via "New Game+"\nSpeaking of cosmetics, there's a lot of cosmetic items in the game that you can find and customize the looks of your characters with if you are willing to seek them out (they are usually fairly well hidden).\nThe game rewards you with plenty of really great skits for the most random things. These skits are much better quality than in other tales games, are fully voiced over, and are generally extremely funny. This is good, since the gravity of the situation you're stuck in would be hella depressing otherwise.\n\nSeriously, you read this entire review?

I guess that makes this a more or less unbiased review in terms of series nostalgia, which may make it more or less appealing depending on who is reading it.\n\nI'll get straight to the point here -- this is my first ever review on Steam, and I am writing it exclusively to say that this game is amazing. Downright incredible. From the very start, it pulls you in with charming designs, likeable characters and interactions, and a battle system that feels unique, flexible, and interesting. And as you go along, this feeling never diminishes, even once. Steam doesn't seem to have clocked all of my hours since I played a good number of them offline, but I have been playing for a fairly good amount of time, and I am still marveling at the novelty of the characters, the exciting variety in the gameplay, and the beauty of the world built around everything this game has to offer.\n\nIf you enjoy action RPGs, I would say don't hesitate for even a second in picking up ToZ. If you enjoy story-driven games, DEFINITELY do not wait. ToZ is largely driven by a charming and engaging story which doesn't feel tedious or exhausting, largerly due to the characters it focuses on. If you like games purely for aesthetic reasons, you have a real charmer here, too, with exciting and gripping character and location designs.\n\nIn short: play Tales of Zestiria. It's wonderful, and you won't regret it.","January 15","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unavailablelink/recommended/351970/","unavailablelink","Gulfoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unavailablelink/","44 products in account","After finishing the game I've decided to put in additional thoughts and provide the perspective of someone who hasn't played any other recent Tales games. I didn't expect a lot about the game and by all means I enjoyed it, some points in this review people might disagree since some of them expects a lot and so on. Nevertheless, here are my thoughts:\n\n+Deep battle system, it does not encourage you to just mash buttons on your way to victory, which is true if you're playing in higher difficulties.\n+Skits are very entertaining and always a thing I look forward to.\n+Lots of character development among the main characters of the game and everyone is likeable in terms of personality. Some secondary characters also provided a huge part in the story.\n+Difficulty system rewards you with better drops and allows you to learn the battle system much faster.\n+There's still post game content once you've finished the game and lots of stuff gets unlocked once you start NG+\n+The music of the game was spectacular, mostly the music inside the trials.\n\n~ I'd stay neutral story-wise as it is a subjective matter on how you take the game, it feels lacking at some point on some characters but other than that it all made sense to me.\n\n- Equipment system is too complex and grindy. If you want to maximize the potential of the system, you need to grind a lot and I find it hard to maximize everything in your first playthrough it would be better if you try to maximize it on subsequent playthroughs.\n- Unless you're really good, some, if not most, battles forces you to use armatization since some monsters/bosses can kill your characters pretty easy. This happens most of the time on higher difficulties (Intense, Chaos) since the level of the enemies grow a lot and damage potential is increased.\n- Armatization can be abused to the point a battle can be very cheap. i.e. spamming a seraphic arte over and over until the enemies die.\n- Camera during battles becomes awkward when fighting in small corners as the camera gets zoomed in a lot to the point you can't see anything. A slight fix would be to use the "Free Walk" button to be able to see your character.\n- The AI of your allies doesn't really help you much in battle, yes, they die a lot for no reason. I find this very frustrating on some boss fights, even on some random encounters, since they tend to target your allies a lot or cast huge spells which your allies just tank. They also tend to split from armatization then die immediately afterwards even if you try to armatize them. In order to alleviate this, you have to micromanage everyone during fights to minimize the deaths and hope that they don't mess up everytime you switch into another character.\n\nGreat overall game, which you can play at your own pace (which I did), I finished my first playthrough by finishing all the sidequests and doing what I can to improve my equipment.","January 18","true","122.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inyongthegr8/recommended/351970/","inyongthegr8","BRILLIANT 2U","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inyongthegr8/","142 products in account","I've finished the game and I can say that the story is impressive, but somewhat rushed and gives little emphasis to villains since the story focused more on Sorey alone being a Shepherd and saving the world from spreading the malevolence. However, I will admit that it's immersive in a way, especially when you start sleeping in inns and discover significant places that trigger skits known as Discovery Points. That's where this game redeems itself in terms of skits through character development.\n\nCharacter Development. Characters are well developed, yet needs more room for improvement as stated above. The good part of this game is that there is a companion that you can talk to, to aid you in doing your side quest (known as Sub Episodes) as well as your main quest (known as Main Episodes) which is a feature I love so I know where I left off in the event I stopped playing for some time. This includes, but not limited to Iris Gems which requires collection to further progress to the story so it would be the borderline of Sub Episodes and Main Episodes since the player doesn't know in the first place that they had to collect Iris Gems. Aside from that, the characters are immersive as well so I do not see that as a problem as a whole, except that, characters needs more emphasis because the party members of Sorey are just supporting him and that's that. Comical relief for the characters as a whole has exceeded my expectations in a Japanese Role-Playing Game.\n\nEquipment System. The equipment fusion system is somewhat confusing because of the learning curve. The learning curve is so high to the point that it will be hard for you to get at first glance. You can do that by activating a skit by sleeping in the inn and by progression. Aside from that, some of the equipments in the shops are expensive from the start, but it will be alleviated as you immerse yourself to the game by encountering more enemies as you play. The summary is this: as you discover more weapons, more properties will be included in the equipment that you find during your playthrough. At the end of the day, discovering possible combinations to further synergize your passive skills to take advantage of the battle will help, especially in dire situations like optional bosses. If you're also planning to increase your stat as you level up, that's another strategy as well if you are planning to focus on a specific stat. Examples are the following: Increasing of Blast Gauge and Increasing of a certain stat as you level up. Some equipments that you obtain provide immunities, and when stacked up, you will be resistant to ailments by half, if not fully resistant. However, Fusion System will break the stack that you created, so it's all about the strategy right there.\n\nBattle System. It's good and it really feels like an action game for me because of how I control my character. The learning curve is easy and as you progress, strategies must be made to further take advantage of your enemy/ies's weaknesses and resistance. Aside from that, taking advantage of the power hits and juggling the enemy/ies is the way to go. This is better with multiplayer because the AI in Zestiria is half-baked and they tend to waste more Blast Gauge than usual in terms of utilising Armatization, this is noticeable in the final parts of the game, especially after tinkering the Strategy menu. But don't get me wrong. The AI is also intelligent and adapts accordingly, this is applicable before the final parts of the game, but it's not as perfect as what you think. Aiming for a no-KO for this game is something you will work hard on, especially when you are under leveled when dealing with high-tier bosses. High-tier bosses are those bosses that roam around the field with the dark smoke at the center of the enemy. Most high-tier bosses will not offer a retry but it's a gamble. However, I believe that issuing AI presets such as Prioritize Defense, Spread Out and Focus Attacks. For the Prioritize Defense, the AI tends to spam restorative and buffs all the way when they could better guard themselves from the enemy/ies's attacks as well as Spreading Out doesn't do its job either because some AIs tend to attack even though the first player ordered the AIs to Spread Out (Taken the consideration of utilizing the Strategy menu). Focusing attacks to the enemy is a lackluster for me, as it's vague whether a) the AI has to focus on the enemy attack or b) the AI has to focus on what the enemy/ies attack will come to further counter-attack the artes of the enemy/ies casted to a specific character. Don't forget the camera issues as well, it will kill your momentum in battle! Battle actions are also a plus to further customize your needs during a battle. I do recommend that you check your battle actions from time to time as you progress the game. You might discover a new battle action that will benefit you.\n\nQuick saves. They are useful especially in emergency situations where Save Points aren't accessible. This is the feature that I am impressed as how Tales implemented it. However, the issue that I find in this game is that, when the player starts loading from the last save data, and the player started to quick save before the boss battle, it will load to the LAST SAVED DATA (where the player saves in the save point) rather than loading from the quick save. The player has to go to menu and will need to load the quick save by themselves.\n\nOf course, some minor but commendable system that needs to be mentioned is that, the encounters are somewhat realistic, such as this one: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=650984631\nBut of course, Sorey didn't fall. There was just a major re-positioning of the characters and of the battlefield.\n\nPorting issues. It's somewhat half-baked as well, but tolerable (thanks to the community fix by Kaldaien, I was able to hit 60FPS with this game but it's almost perfect for a port) because Bamco just ported the game in Playstation 3 up to Playstation 4, that can only hit up to 30 FPS. I hope that they will improve on that more in their future games.\n\nSoundtrack. I love the soundtrack of this game. You will love it once you progress through the game.\n\nSo far, I recommend this game for those who are planning to buy Tales of Zestiria, however, it's better if it's on sale and includes discounts.","March 28","true","164.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since then the Tales of Series has had their fair share of great titles, somewhat good games and then bad games that thankfully for company reasons didn't want those games to be released in the West. Whatever the case these games are known for their entertaining skit sequences, great storylines and characters and enjoyable battle systems which are well loved in the hearts of RPG fans alike. Here we are now with the next new instalment with Tales of Zestiria which was announced and eventually released to celebrate 20 years of the long running franchise. It now aims for an open world landscape design, fusions Dragon Ball Z style as well as brining the best ideas from old tales instalments. Sure it's earned a bit of controversy in Japan for the game's handing of the main characters and has earned some rather unfair reviews over in the West. So what does this new Tales instalment fell in the eyes of a long running Tales player like myself? well I am so glad that I get to answer that question.\n\nThe setting of Tales of Zestiria takes place in a medieval fantasy world where the land is corrupted by a dark source called malevolence which are caused by the negative emotions caused between the people. Humanity's only chance of purifying the land is the power of the Shepherd and the main character Sorey being your every day standard J-RPG protagonist takes on that sacred duty of becoming a Shepherd and gains the power to fight the hellions. The characters of Tales of Zestiria are very likeable and their character development during the course of the game are great to watch. Sorey is the usual kind of J-RPG protagonist who wants to know about the world as well as exploring the various ruins, he also wants to believe that humans should be able to coexist with spiritual beings known as Seraphim which cannot be seen by the human eyes. Mikleo voiced by Scott Manville who also did Lloyd from Tales of Symphonia also tends to enjoy exploring ruins as much as Sorey but also ends up being the cautious type but their brotherly relationship is a cool sight to behold. Lailah is a pun artist who will use them as a way out of telling out her oath but acts a real support for Sorey. Edna tends to make fun of the party and other people's situations and also loves to insult Mikleo by calling him Meebo which is very funny. Later on in the game there is Dezel who vows revenge for the death of his friend and lastly there are Alisha and Rose. Alisha is a princess of Hyland who takes her role as a knight who will do what she can to help out her kingdom but she holds conflictions between understanding what it takes to keep the peace as a princess as well as upholding her status as a knight. Rose a character who fills Alisha's role for Sorey offers support for him but also acts as a boss for the Sparrowfeathers and a merchant who believes what she thinks is right for Sorey and his friends and her members. The writing is really good and the english dub acting is very strong showing the emotions of each of the characters very well, plus there is also the option for the Japanese audio tracks if the players so desire.\n\nTales of Zestiria's new gameplay change is that it goes for an openworld exploration which allows you to explore the vast reaches of the world as you see fit, it uses the same field controls like in the Tales of Xillia games so that you'll feel more familiar. The openworld design allows you to explore the environments freely both without the penalty of having tough enemies that can destroy the player instantly (aside from optional boss encounters) and also unlocking new areas at a reasonable pace as you go through the storyline. Compared to Final Fantasy XII which did use the openworld design before this game Tales of Zestiria has a well executed openworld design that makes you feel like an explorer without the game having to punish you for going of the main path which is a great thing. You'll explore grassy field areas, mountains and plenty of cavern and ruin areas which each have treasure and herbs to pick up and returning from Tales of Graces there are hidden discovery points that can be unearthed.\n\nSome areas will have a puzzle to solve which will involve either lighting up pedestal with fire, making your way through areas without being seen using the water, breaking blocks with earth and jumping past gaps using the wind. The earth and wind puzzles are quite good and can be done without any stress but the fire and water puzzles are the worst the game throws at you. The fire puzzles require you to light up a pedestal in order but the twist is that you need to light one of those from a direction that it wants you to light it up from which can be confusing unless you look underneath the pedestal indicating the direction and in what order you need to light them in. The worst puzzles come from the water trial where you need to use the water power to get past the eyes without being noticed, if you happen to get spotted by the eyes you get warped back to the start of the entire dungeon. It doesn't help that sometimes you'll walk into a room and then BAM! the eyes instantly see you without any warning. This actually forces the player to take it slow and examine where the eyes are and then use the water power to make it past it, however even when you do manage to unlock warp points you still end up back at the dungeon entrance if you get spotted which will force you redo some areas which afterwards it just becomes annoying. There was a sequence where I got stuck after defeating a boss fight in Marlind and I had no idea what to do next and it wasn't until I looked online that I found out that you had to burn those dark cloud hellion things using a fire spell that were placed all over the town. I had no idea that I was meant to do so because I didn't think there was possibly any indication at all during any dialogue at all at that point unless I skipped something.\n\nYou can take a stop in exploration to visit a town in order to rest up and heal up, purchase equipment and items and also get information from NPC's to your next objective or side quests you know like in other J-RPGs of the last decade or so. Sidequests and shopping have undergone a change, for sidequests they are much easier to track down thanks to a new conversation that you have with the character following you, you can talk to the character following you to have him/her remind you of your current objective or for a side quest's destination. Sidequests will range from fighting optional encounters that are hidden all through each of the maps, collecting gems or just for cutscenes and skits to unlock hidden items. Each of the ingame shops returning the levelling up system from Tales of Xillia only that each store has their own set of items and gears and buying each item increases that shops experience, if at maximum they start doing discount sales and also sell out their best item for sale if you have the gald for it.\n\nTo view my full review of Tales of Zestiria visit my channel on Gamespot with this link. http://www.gamespot.com/tales-of-zestiria/user-reviews/2200-12668681/","April 4","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Mainly with explaining mechanics and how you do things, for someone like me who does not own an Xbox controller and is just using a standard USB controller with a PS3 layout the button mappings are a complete mess and some don't work at all. Meanwhile it does not help that in some battles you get a kinda random tutorial and are required to do certain actions and sometimes pressing the button that should do that action does nothing at all. also while this could just be a problem of me not using an Xbox controller but sometimes it does not even tell me what button I should press on the controller to get the desired action and instead tells me what button on the keyboard to press, and during all this, you could be in a said tutorial battle-sequence thing where you can't quicksave nor access your control mappings.(From the little time I used mouse and keyboard, most of this is averted by using them, but who wants to play a JRPG with a keyboard and mouse!?) There is also a lack of settings, when you set your volume, you better be damn pleased with it, because as far as I can tell, there isn't a way to change it, but all that aside, I don't mind just figuring out stuff as I go along as I'll likely end up re-playing this game as time goes on and I get used to the battle mechanics, if you want clear tutorials, this game does not deliver. Speaking of battle mechanics, this game is a cross of Xenoblade Chronicles, and Kingdom Hearts (2 to be exact, there are even drive forms!) Unlike those games though, while this one does have a free roam ability during battles, it does not really offer any tactical advantage besides not being locked to a grid. Meanwhile the actual combat is a mix of KH and Xenoblade, there really is no good way to explain it, but pointing the left control stick or (WSAD respectively) and whatever you have attack set to will do a different attack, meanwhile dodges take up part of your combo, meaning if you dodge once and attack immediately after, you will do the second hit of your combo. On the story side of things, it's pretty normal, kid grows up in some strange circumstance/something that makes him different from the rest some interesting stuff happens in his normally uneventful life, baddies show up, and before you know it, you end up with some mystical power/ legendary role and get tasked with killing what I would presume to be the final boss. Holy ♥♥♥♥, that's one large wall of text, don't worry over time as I learn the game better and have more thoughts I'll format this and make it look nice, but for now, this is my opinon overall. It's worth it for 50% off, I would not have gotten it under any other circumstances, from what I have played it is not worth 40 something bucks, but for 23 or whatever it's on sale for now? Sure why not? From what I see on steam, there isn't much in terms of JRPGs besides Final Fantasy, and who wants to play a turn based game? For fans of the genre? Yes, get it, you will enjoy the characters and the world along with figuring out the battle system, but for more casual players, I would wait for a bit more of a price cut.","April 30","true","43.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, I will admit that it's immersive in a way, especially when you start sleeping in inns and discover significant places that trigger skits known as Discovery Points. That's where this game redeems itself in terms of skits through character development.\n\nCharacter Development. Characters are well developed, yet needs more room for improvement as stated above. The good part of this game is that there is a companion that you can talk to, to aid you in doing your side quest (known as Sub Episodes) as well as your main quest (known as Main Episodes) which is a feature I love so I know where I left off in the event I stopped playing for some time. This includes, but not limited to Iris Gems which requires collection to further progress to the story so it would be the borderline of Sub Episodes and Main Episodes since the player doesn't know in the first place that they had to collect Iris Gems. Aside from that, the characters are immersive as well so I do not see that as a problem as a whole, except that, characters needs more emphasis because the party members of Sorey are just supporting him and that's that. Comical relief for the characters as a whole has exceeded my expectations in a Japanese Role-Playing Game.\n\nEquipment System. The equipment fusion system is somewhat confusing because of the learning curve. The learning curve is so high to the point that it will be hard for you to get at first glance. You can do that by activating a skit by sleeping in the inn and by progression. Aside from that, some of the equipments in the shops are expensive from the start, but it will be alleviated as you immerse yourself to the game by encountering more enemies as you play. The summary is this: as you discover more weapons, more properties will be included in the equipment that you find during your playthrough. At the end of the day, discovering possible combinations to further synergize your passive skills to take advantage of the battle will help, especially in dire situations like optional bosses. If you're also planning to increase your stat as you level up, that's another strategy as well if you are planning to focus on a specific stat. Examples are the following: Increasing of Blast Gauge and Increasing of a certain stat as you level up. Some equipments that you obtain provide immunities, and when stacked up, you will be resistant to ailments by half, if not fully resistant. However, Fusion System will break the stack that you created, so it's all about the strategy right there.\n\nBattle System. It's good and it really feels like an action game for me because of how I control my character. The learning curve is easy and as you progress, strategies must be made to further take advantage of your enemy/ies's weaknesses and resistance. Aside from that, taking advantage of the power hits and juggling the enemy/ies is the way to go. This is better with multiplayer because the AI in Zestiria is half-baked and they tend to waste more Blast Gauge than usual in terms of utilising Armatization, this is noticeable in the final parts of the game, especially after tinkering the Strategy menu. But don't get me wrong. The AI is also intelligent and adapts accordingly, this is applicable before the final parts of the game, but it's not as perfect as what you think. Aiming for a no-KO for this game is something you will work hard on, especially when you are under leveled when dealing with high-tier bosses. High-tier bosses are those bosses that roam around the field with the dark smoke at the center of the enemy. Most high-tier bosses will not offer a retry but it's a gamble. However, I believe that issuing AI presets such as Prioritize Defense, Spread Out and Focus Attacks. For the Prioritize Defense, the AI tends to spam restorative and buffs all the way when they could better guard themselves from the enemy/ies's attacks as well as Spreading Out doesn't do its job either because some AIs tend to attack even though the first player ordered the AIs to Spread Out (Taken the consideration of utilizing the Strategy menu). Focusing attacks to the enemy is a lackluster for me, as it's vague whether a) the AI has to focus on the enemy attack or b) the AI has to focus on what the enemy/ies attack will come to further counter-attack the artes of the enemy/ies casted to a specific character. Don't forget the camera issues as well, it will kill your momentum in battle! Battle actions are also a plus to further customize your needs during a battle. I do recommend that you check your battle actions from time to time as you progress the game. You might discover a new battle action that will benefit you.\n\nQuick saves. They are useful especially in emergency situations where Save Points aren't accessible. This is the feature that I am impressed as how Tales implemented it. However, the issue that I find in this game is that, when the player starts loading from the last save data, and the player started to quick save before the boss battle, it will load to the LAST SAVED DATA (where the player saves in the save point) rather than loading from the quick save. The player has to go to menu and will need to load the quick save by themselves.\n\nOf course, some minor but commendable system that needs to be mentioned is that, the encounters are somewhat realistic, such as this one: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=650984631\nBut of course, Sorey didn't fall. There was just a major re-positioning of the characters and of the battlefield.\n\nPorting issues. It's somewhat half-baked as well, but tolerable (thanks to the community fix by Kaldaien, I was able to hit 60FPS with this game but it's almost perfect for a port) because Bamco just ported the game in Playstation 3 up to Playstation 4, that can only hit up to 30 FPS. I hope that they will improve on that more in their future games.\n\nSoundtrack. I love the soundtrack of this game. You will love it once you progress through the game.\n\nSo far, I recommend this game for those who are planning to buy Tales of Zestiria, however, it's better if it's on sale and includes discounts.","March 28","true","164.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IronHeads/recommended/351970/","IronHeads","KellFromHell (D/S)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IronHeads/","104 products in account","Here is what you need to know:\n\n+ If you never played a Tales game before, you will still feel at home playing this one. Why? Because when you're in the world of Zestiria; the music, the landscape, and the characters remind you of the RPGs you played growing up. It has a 'classic' aura. Best way I can describe it. Now, though it has this feel - you know it's a 'new' game. Little tell-tale signs of such pop up here an there. The detail you'll see up close, the animations, voice acting, etc etc.\n\n+ Optimization. I'll say this, I've had NO significant trouble with this game. I run it all at max and is fine. Only thing I notice now an again is slight clipping. It's rare, it effects the game not at all. So overall, I think they did a wonderful job on this port.\n\n+ Fashion. I like the way they do the outfit system in this game. It's not TOO simple as to say, give you one slot for a head to toe outfit. You can mix things up and give yourself a unique look.\n\n- Combat. It feels tight. Which, most Tales games do to an extent. This moreso. I wish they'd have given more options to adjust your party's AI.\n\n- Skill tree...kinda. Seems like they could have done this easier. I still haven't really understood what it does when it does it. Not completely. I don't mind things being complex, and this certainly isn't the MOST complex system I've seen. It just feels clunky.\n\nMain buying points to keep in mind.\n\nUnless you plan on waiting 5ish years, this game won't drop below 19.99 IF it ever gets THAT low. If you want this game, get it now or maybe wait for a sale to when it's like 10 dollars off.\nIF you like JRPGs, get it - plain an simple. You'll get excited to play it. You'll have that thing where, you can't sleep very well, because you just want to get back on an play.\n\nNow if you like RPGs in general, get it. Same as above.\n\nBUT, if you are the type raised on Western RPGs. You might not be as into this. You won't find this poking through political barriers, or showing breasts. You won't have movie quality graphics. This is more anime style, and like I said - a throwback to older games. Where the world's landscape seems like a more detailed world map.\n\nIf you've never played an RPG or JRPG before - this is a decent one to give a go.  I'm enjoying the hell out of it. And I haven't really enjoyed a JRPG in what feels like forever.\nSo, buy it and enjoy it.","October 21, 2015","true","27.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I play with my bf so we were getting a good laugh specially with Lailah xD\nPre Order things: Cameo Weapons+Skins(that brings the OST in battle wich is GREAT but you can disable it if you don't like it)+Symphona was an amazing deal for just 49.99 but if you didn't buy it yet be sure to get it before the Alisha DLC run out (I think it is around november).\nGameplay/Fighting is quite nice due that you can keep on and on as long you know how to manage your TP.\n\nBad:\nI think my only gripe but for all versions is the camera glitch specially on close halls but you can still move your camera with your right analog stick (if you play with a controller).

This will be partial as I haven't yet finished the game.\n\nVisual: What can I say that doesn't sound as a fan-screaming all over the place? Hahaha, It's beautifully well done, the wide arrange of visual options let you run the game with a good dynamism either on a simple computer or a pseudo-spaceship. Running it on a full graphical option rewards you with excelent definition, lovely colouring and impresive shading in both the characters and the environment. (I still haven't found glitches in any place).\nIt's impressive that the only LITTLE and I repeat "Little" is the walking speed animation of Sorey which seems a bit jumpy and forced compared to the rest of the characters.\n\nAudio: Jeez!, I know the tales of saga is famous for the wonderful soundtracks, scenery audio or background musics, but this one takes the prize! Might sound exaggerated to say it's the best one of the 31 tales until now... But if not, it damn well near the top 3.\nThe fighting music as well as the scene ones are top notch. They are well rounded and you can actually listen to them for hours without even noticing the time you've being doing it.\nPeople have been saying that the Abyss intro song was one of the best around (Karma-Bump of Chicken for the ones interested). But the intro on Zestiria is actually electrifing! (White light-Superfly) I highly praise the selection they did and how good it was merged togethre with the scenes around.\n\nGameplay: Well, here you would expect the game to really shine... And it actually does! The control system is extremely well thought, the battle options are wide and quite easy to understand, and depth enough to be able to give it time to propperly master it. The Artes / Hidden artes options are well defined, the equipement system is extremely original and rewarding once understood. The originality of leaving behind the mana option exchanging it for an action points bar which is dinamically recovered through the battle is simply exilarating.\nIt is also excelent the way it's thoght the interaction between Seraphs and Humans during the battle. The fusion system as well as the tag-battle option is something they managed to comply without loosing the dynamism of the battle itself. Which we can aslo add that they improved the encounter system so much as to barely feel the in/out of each battle (and we can all agree that it's one of the points that weights down any RPG around).\nThe only little downside on this element that I was able to find, is the limitation on free movement inside the battle which is kinda limitating for veterans on the "Tales of" saga (You need to keep a key pressed to be able to do so).\nI could go on and on with gameplay quirks that makes the game excelent, but I don't want to fall in spoil anyone the surprise of encountering them through the game.\n\nMenus: I decided to separate this category from gameplay due a simple detail. With everything as it is planned out the menus and the options they present do not affect the gameplay at all. They could present to be a bit widespread on a keyboard (If you decide to play the game with one, as if you do You will realize the game is completly playable with either controllers o keyboard). But besides that, everything is well presented in a way you can actually understand every option avaliable to you.\nA little downside on the menu distribution could be the small incapacity to check your own equipment perks in the equipment fusion window.\n\nStory: (I refuse to make points on this until i complete the game on 100%, but I can say at least that the character progression and the personalities presented are excelent and completly likeable from begining to end)\n\nMaking a briefing I can say that this game is another Precious jewel and an excelent addition to anyone's library. SPECIALLY for any "Tales of " fan out there.\nGive it a try, then another try... Then loose every bit of free time you can muster on your life to this game!... You won't regret it!.\n\n9.9/10","October 21, 2015","true","99.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I had never heard of the 'Tales of' games before and was very curious about it because of how excited he was to play it. After he explained to me what the games were I figured it was worth a try... and I was not disappointed! The game has a very good story and unique, likable characters (two characteristics every RPG should have in my opinion). Also, the battle system is done very well except for the camera angles when fighting in tight spaces. I think the only thing that I wasn't particularly fond of was how the menu was layed out when trying to fuse equipment. Having to switch back and forth between the fusion menu and the skills menu could get annoying when trying to fuse multiple types of equipment for more than one character, but I think that might just be me nitpicking a little bit. Overall this was a great game and I would definitely recommend it to others who want to get into the 'Tales of' games.

At the time of launch however it has suffered major bugs but kudos to the Steam forum admin who was taking feedback and giving progress on fixes as well as another user who provided his own fix (the individual even helped me personally which was great) but fortunately now the game is pretty stable. It does only run at 30 fps but I don't mind it and sadly it was developed with 30 in mind so increasing to 60 sounds like it wont happen.\n\nThe start of the game isn't very promising, just a warning. It starts out with the same story we have all heard before, hand-holding tutorials, and slow-narrative pacing. Give it time though; the game does improve in all those areas. Combat opens up as you get your party together (most of the games party joins in the first chapter of the game), the narrative and characters become more developed and interesting beyond their trope-like first impressions, and the combat becomes very easy to learn, difficult to master.\n\nAs of right now, my biggest complaint has to be equipment and items. They are overly complex to the point where it breaks pacing. Same name items now may have different stats, they can be fused which could make them better or worse, you have a skill sheet too thats tied to equipment that stacks in different ways with each other, etc. I find myself having to stop and take several minutes at a time trying to min-max my equipment trying to figure out what it will mean, what will work, what wont, etc. and it isn't any fun. True, previous games it was boring simple how they were mostly just flat stat upgrades but it was quick and to the point. Here, I'm several hours into the game and I'm still confused how it all works and it's throwing off the pacing where I'm trying to cure a plague from a town only to be stuck wondering why I have a locked skill on my spear because I missed that note on page 13/80 on how equipment works.\n\nSo far I would say the game is great dispite the drawbacks. The bugs are mostly squashed with fixes available, and the item system I hate can thankfully be mostly ignored (once I figured that the stats at this point weren't that big a deal it helped my enjoyment immensly) and I'm becoming more invested in the story now. Pretty solid so far, would recommend.\n\nAlso on the note of DLC, the game currently has several DLCs in the form of costumes primarily but theres a $19.99 DLC that consists of cheats essentially. Pretty lame but avoidable.\n\nUPDATE: After playing for a while now my opinions haven't changed much but I did start to find myself get into a rhythem and I'm still have fun, so despite the faults it's pretty good overall.","November 5, 2015","true","110.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Combat is not as deep as other entries (Like Vesperia or Xillia but is fun enough to do 100+ hits easily)\n\nBattles takes place in something they call Fusionic Chain Linear Motion Battle System. What does that means? Well, battles are not played in a separate screen or a special stage as usual, battles this time take place in the same space as exploration, so the enviroment and topography can affect the combat this time.\n\nSoundtrack as always is amazing, specially the song called Rising Up!\n\nThat said, there are some little annoyances that can spoil the fun at times:\n- The camera angles break often\n- Some bosses have Artificial Difficulty (I'm looking at you, Eizen, Angel and Turtlez)\n- >30 fps lock in a pc game (can be bypassed by a mod though)\n- Playing with a keyboard can be a nightmare\n- Petrify can't be healed\n- The Item fusion feature is unnecessarily complex (Although not hard)\n\nWith over 50 hours I can easily recommend this game to anyone who likes JRPG or the "Tales of" franchise.\n\nALSO ROSE IS THE BEST GIRL, EDNA IS A CLOSE SECOND, LAILAH IS A FUNNY WAIFU AND ALISHA IS PRETTY BUT KINDA STUPID.\n\np.s: The Im@s dlc is great and so is the Tales of Characters costume set","December 10, 2015","true","76.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've seen playthroughs of Xillia/2 & Graces. I really like most of the characters the Tales of series has presented throughout its many stories. Some of those games do have "cliche" stories, but the saving grace for them all are the characters, you care for them, the many side quests make you involved with them and their quirks.\n\nNow when it comes to Zestiria, the story is so boring an uninspiring I could just not care less about it. But I kept playing because I know "Tales of" and I kept thinking something big is bound to happen, some character is likely to be hiding a big twist for the story. The characters, oh boy, I can't believe it myself but there is literally only one character I like in this game and that is simply because she's my "type" (Edna) as I love sarcastic/ironic characters. I could not care less about any of the rest of the cast, they are so boring and bland, lacking that special something that all other Tales Of characters have.\n\nI bought this game the day it came out, and I havent finished it yet, thats how much I care about this cast and this story. The game felt more like a chore than a game, making it open world didn't help in the least either if the whole place is empty!","May 30","false","53.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There are some minor issues like the game not using the dedicated GPU by default and VSync not working unless you enable it in your graphics card's control panel, but I can imagine those being patched in the near future.\n\nThe (in-combat) gameplay is fun, somewhat intuitive and depending on the dificulty settings quite challenging (duh). There are some details that I really like, like a "have-I-talked-to-you-yet?" icon above NPCs and some about which I wonder why they are even in the game (the so called Treasure Detection triggers at like 3m distance to the chest. Nice.).\n\nCan't say much about the story obviously, but from what I *have* seen so far it's a not too dark story as you'd find it in other JRPGs with spirits, apparently dragons and knight-princesses that wear rather, uhhm, unprotective armor. Well ok, it's not as bad as I made it sound, but it's still a JRPG.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, even the usual "you're travelling around the world" music is great and doesn't get boring.\n\nSo I'd say give it a go if you're into this sort of stuff, and don't if you're not. I am though. Have a nice day :)\n\nEDIT: The story just got a bit darker.","October 20, 2015","true","44.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It support low/med PC or laptop.\nIt's good no lagging or crashes until now.\n\n+ Keyboard+Mouse support.\nYes you can play with either Mouse+Keyboard or controller.\n\n+ Japanese or English Voice\nWell some people is too lazy to read subtitles, so here it is the option you can choose between japanese or english voice\n\n+ Two Player Support\nYou can play single player or two players, where your friend control one of the AI party in battle.\n\n+ Features\nMany features that make this game quite unique such as hidden artes, sephard artes, equipment skill combination,   customes, and many more that I haven't unlocked yet.\n\n+ Grinding\nMonsters will respawn again if you go to the other maps. So yes you can hunt the monster as much as you want I think.\n\nCons :\n- Can't really free run in battle unless you press the  button combined with movemont keys.\nNot a big deal, but just feel quite uncomfortable. Tales of Abyss has the best movement for me coz it's quite familiar. *Edit : okay so this can be reversed after you got Free & Free battle action. So it's fix the problem. I don't know it's a feature in game lol\n\n- Suddenly I got that "program stop working" error, like crash game, everytime after I quit game from title menu. It's quite funny because I got crash for quiting game? never crash or anything when playing the game tho.. soooo it's kinda.. not.. a.. pro..blem? idk lol\n\nI think that's it for my review now.\nHaven't played that far so can't talk about the story and characters yet.

The music, as always, is incredible for the mood. The cel-shaded graphics add to the nice anime feel, and the cutscenes are of incredible quality. The voice acting is hit or miss thus far, but is not distracting.\n\nCombat is as you would expect from the free-motion system, and the customization of items and purifying of malevolence will add a new depth rather than just "get to new town, buy new weapons" that it has often been in the past for Tales games.\n\nThe story is intriguing, and can be confusing if the player is not paying attention right from the start. Don't skip scenes early on, lest you not understand the core communication aspects Sorey has with Mikleo in comparison to someone like Alisha.\n\nOverall, for Tales and non-Tales fans alike, an enjoyable experience thus far that I assume will only continue as I plunge more into it.","October 19, 2015","true","58.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pwister/recommended/351970/","Pwister","Pwister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pwister/","234 products in account","Tales of Zestiria is another installment of the "Tales of" series of RPGs, a series that's been standing since Tales of Phantasia on the Super Famicom in 1995. The series has 2 internal teams that make each game, and this was made by Team Destiny, who also worked on Tales of Destiny, and Tales of Graces, so this shares a lot of similarities with those games.\n\nStory: The land has been corrupted by malevolance, and the Shepherd, working alongside beings called Seraphims can quell it, and purify it back to it's normal state. The Lord of Calamity is the main villain, carrying just way too much malevolance, and the main goal is to become strong enough as a shephard with the help of your companions to defeat him and purify the world.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters, all of the characters are really convincing. Their personalities stick, and none of the characters feel too dumb or naive. Everyone in the group has a great since of humor, and if you like terrible puns then you'll love the skits and banter between the cast.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on the Linear Motion Battle System, a system in which you move on a line between you and your targets, initiating attacks based on what direction you input along with the attack buttons. You can hold down a button to unlock from the line, and move freely around the combat arena to reposition, and you can dash along the line and circle around your target to dodge. The arena is made right on the field map, rather than going into a seperate screen, so things like trees and walls come into count when dodging and running around (although this can make the camera bug out sometimes). Combos are basically put together for you in this iteration, so you can focus on just using the right weaknesses and whatnot. The item management is really intuitive, and once you get used to it it becomes very easy to put together exactly what skills you want to come out of your gear.\n\nThe dungeons and field exploration are a lot more open than what we've grown used to in Tales of Xillia. No longer is the world just a line, just going straight from town to town through copy and pasted valleys filled with recolors of the same enemies. With the adition of the on-field seraph actions, it even manages to intuitively push you in the right direction while still not feeling linear at all.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about Zestiria is that the party feels a lot weaker when you don't throw them all in the same pot. Looking at Tales of Graces, every character had amazing strengths, and few weaknesses. There was even an option to go into fights with just the one character you're playing, without the other 3 members, because everyone could hold their own. In Tales of Zestiria, only Sorey and Rose really feel balanced out as strong characters, but the Seraphs are very clearly just there to cover weaknesses, and to buff the human characters. This kind of pushes you into sticking to Sorey the entire game, and throws the idea of maining any other party member out the window.\n\nWhile not my favorite Tales game, it falls very close second under Tales of Vesperia. The mechanics are fun, the story is nice, and it's overall a great experience. Let's just hope they don't do it again. Everything feels great in Zestiria, but I really hope the next game is even more new things. The open field combat arena battles are cool, but it would be great if that was only a one-time deal. The same with how they managed the party setup and the field actions. Given the past couple games, where Xillia felt like Graces with a different camera angle, let's just hope Tales of Berseria brings something new to the table.","October 23, 2015","true","103.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I love the JRPG style of gameplay and finding loot, exploring, etc. It took awhile to get used to the controls on the keyboard/mouse. I had to find the right rythym to get off the specific attacks I wanted. And while the gameplay is fun to me, I find most other components of the game to be lacking. I find the story to be acceptable though some claim it is cliche and lackluster, I find it to be a different take on saving the world.\n\nMy biggest complaint, is that the main character is supposed to be BIG into dungeon diving and relics. Yet the only thing you will find in the dungeons of this game, are enemies, treasure chests, and corridors. Here is a small example of how barren the dungeons are. After playing 40 or so hours, walking into a dungeon and seeing a torch made me suspicious. I went over to the torch to see if it was something I needed to activate. If a single light source makes me think something is out of place in a dungeon, then you can imagine how barren it is. Literally rooms and corridors. Maybe a decoration bit here or there, but you will always check them because they all scream out of place. All of these dungeons are like this that ive been in except the very first.\n\nThe overworld is beautiful and the skyboxes are quite nice. Yet you will see the same enemies throughout the game just with different color schemes which is a con.

I love the JRPG style of gameplay and finding loot, exploring, etc. It took awhile to get used to the controls on the keyboard/mouse. I had to find the right rythym to get off the specific attacks I wanted. And while the gameplay is fun to me, I find most other components of the game to be lacking. I find the story to be acceptable though some claim it is cliche and lackluster, I find it to be a different take on saving the world.\n\nMy biggest complaint, is that the main character is supposed to be BIG into dungeon diving and relics. Yet the only thing you will find in the dungeons of this game, are enemies, treasure chests, and corridors. Here is a small example of how barren the dungeons are. After playing 40 or so hours, walking into a dungeon and seeing a torch made me suspicious. I went over to the torch to see if it was something I needed to activate. If a single light source makes me think something is out of place in a dungeon, then you can imagine how barren it is. Literally rooms and corridors. Maybe a decoration bit here or there, but you will always check them because they all scream out of place. All of these dungeons are like this that ive been in except the very first.\n\nThe overworld is beautiful and the skyboxes are quite nice. Yet you will see the same enemies throughout the game just with different color schemes which is a con. So although I dont have much Tales experience to say how good this one is in comparison, for being my real first Tales game, I would say I am mostly satisfied. I just hope in the future they take the time to add more detail to their dungeons as it becomes droll very fast.","November 10, 2015","true","63.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

What I can say so far is that the game is far more detailed than past Tales games and by far the most innovative entry since Xillia. It has a great setting and recurring story elements here and there that are borrowed from past tales games. The battle system on the other hand is still linear motion although a bit almost like an over the perspective is used for the camera as opposed to how usually you would be able to see all of your characters at once on screen. It'll take a few minutes or so to get used to but it progressively gets more fun. There is a bit of screen tearing which is completely noticable so if this is an issue turn on the in game v-sync and/or v-sync in your gpu control panel. One final thing which may dissapoint some is that there isn't a whole lot of grinding invloved this time around which is usually apperant in past entries although this does keep the story moving rather than slowing down and speeding up in unexpected intervals. I'm a huge tales fan and I've even sold my soul away to Bandai Namco to consistently keep me satisfied with this series so 10/10.","October 19, 2015","true","31.5"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

The "Monoliths" that are spread throughout the game are an ongoing tutorial that begins to drag forever, and it can be VERY EASY to forget many of the helpful features due to their sheer number. Some refinement could have been used to make the game simpler, though as stated above these features and mechanics are at least integrated well. The big IF here is whether or not you have the ability to coordinate your battle and your character(s) like a symphony orchestra conductor.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game that is barely held back by any of its trivial flaws. If you're looking for a lengthy action-RPG with excellent story, you can't go wrong here. Also, it's an RPG on Steam. Buy more of these, and Steam will have more of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/File2ish/recommended/351970/","File2ish","File2ish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/File2ish/","184 products in account","Tales of Zestiria has it's fair share of problems and the game is slow to pick up the pace in the story, but is overall a good game.\n\nWhile the game is visually appealing, especially for those who like anime art styles, the environments can feel bland and closed off. Especially so for the indoor dungeons. If you've played past tales games such as Tales of Symphonia, Tales of Vesperia, Tales of Xillia, and/or Tales of Graces, you'll find the game is more similar to the latter two in terms of combat and design choices.\n\nThe audio in the game is also pretty good. The English voice cast did a great job, and you might hear some familiar VAs as some of the main characters (such as Caitlin Glass [Winry Rockbell in Fullmetal Alchemist and Cammy White in Street Fighter 4 and 5] and Carrie Keranen [Satsuki Kiryuin in Kill la Kill]).\n\nMatoi Sakuraba's soundtrack is as you'd expect for a Tales game (he composed most of the prior games in the series). Go Shiina also composed for Tales of Zestiria (he previously composed Tales of Legendia's OST), and there is a start contrast in the music. You'll know when it's a track by Shiina. And that's a very good thing in my opinion.\n\nThe battles are fun overall, though I prefer the mechanics in other games in the series more (Tales of Symphonia, Vesperia, Xillia, etc.). One thing that knocks the battle system is the camera. There's no good way to control where it is outside of sidestepping around your target. In indoor areas the camera can be a real issue as it will make contact with the wall and zoom in extremely close to the character you control.\n\nAnd there are some difficulty spikes later in the game. Be prepared to grind some levels or lower the difficulty if you find yourself struggling to kill regular monsters. Learning the battle system is key in this game. You can't mash out regular attacks into an arte in this game, the properties of each skill greatly affect the flow of battle (certain types of artes will make enemies cast magic faster instead of interrupting the cast, elemental resistances heavily hinder your damage output, etc.) and avoiding as much damage as possible will help a great deal (i.e. learn to time your side steps/back steps).\n\nThe story is alright by Tales game standards, even if the pacing is not great and one section of the game makes you explore to find certain items if you haven't already (forces some side quests). However, it's nothing to really write home about when comparing it to other games in the series (which is saying something considering the series isn't known for amazing stories and writing). The characters can be likeable as well, but they each fill a stereotypical role in a very "anime" fashion (innocent main character who grows into a hero, happy go lucky person, very mature for her age/appearance "kid", the "cold, quiet, harsh, yet has a soft side" person, etc.).\n\nThe puns make up for it though. Puns are the highest form of humor and the game loves to throw out puns. The localization team did a great job on that.\n\nThe crafting/fusion system is really tedious, though most players probably won't delve really deep into it. Weapons of the same name can be fused together to combine/create new skills attached to them. If you stack a certan amount of skills you gain more better effects, but if you stack too many of the same you get no effect at all. For those less inclined to figuring it out, equipping the highest stat items might be the best way to go.\n\nUltimately it's a pretty good game. Tales of Zestiria certainly isn't the best game in the series (subjective of course), but the good in the game outweigh the bad overall. Story is okay, certain characters can be difficult to like, some design choices are questionable, but it is indeed a Tales game through and through.\n\nAlso the use of puns is great. Recommended.","November 1, 2015","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/recommended/351970/","mahodo","General Lee Aroused","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/","1002 products in account","One of the weaker mothership Tales of games in the series, right next to Tales of Symphonia 2. Continuing the tradition of introducing something really cool in its previous mothership title (in this case, Xillia/Xillia 2's dual raid battle system), but choosing to not take any of its successful elements and incorporate new experimental elements that is rather shakey in its introduction. It did take Graces F's/Destiny's unique style shift battle system, but severely limiting its options through poor choices, one of which was initially not displaying a numerical value of SC required to attack with a specific move while in battle. This makes judging the cost of which combos you want to pull off to a rather vague sense of estimation, though this can be helped by just keeping your SC high (admittedly not a good design choice though).\n\nThe premise so far for the initial story is interesting, but only for the first 2 hours of the game. You play as Sorey (or later Rose), the main character and the chosen Shepard who pulls out the sacred sword (AKA Excalibur) and is given the task of purifying the world of yomas and unify the human and seraphim race into cohabitation. There's a few parts of the story here and there that try to emulate a moral choice, something Xillia 2 did well, but only because it had a silent main character. Zestiria's main character has a clear personaility and when picking a choice, it didn't seem to have much impact as the character simply brushes it off with an ugly "EH" kind of feeling. Gee, for a hero, you're kinda hard to like. The moral choices presented are also pretty weird, for example, you can fix a bridge with earth magic, but you are given a choice, do you want to fix it in front of the people in distress to try to be a hero symbol, or do it when everyone leaves? I choose the "look really cool in front of everyone" and only ONE PERSON reacted with an "oh, okay". Then everyone tells me I was wrong to try to inspire people that there is hope in piety because they would instead take me for a monster that is trying to help them. Goddammit, what do you people want from me.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Utilizing divine weapons as a focus, your human characters can basically temporarily fuse with your seraphim party members to create a new combat form depending on fusion members, something akin to Digimon. Pretty neat, but I wish the fusion character actually looked different for each form, rathern than just a colour pallete and weapon change.\n- Dual audio! Never bad to have a choice, especially when it lets me run away from awkward English dub, its usually a hit or miss on the voice acting charts (such as Abyss and Symphonia being superior in English over Japanese).\n- Pretty decent PC port, was rather shakey at the start, but easily fixable if you look around. Japanese games rarely have good PC ports, so this was a surprise.\n\nCONS:\n- A weird varying degree of difficulty at the start. Normal enemies are incredibly easy fights that they last only 12-16 seconds on moderate difficulty, but boss fights demolish you in 2-3 hits and take a lot longer. I tried to remedy this by bumping up the difficulty on the field for normal encounters, then down for boss encounters, but not all boss fight encounters are obvious. Difficulty level need some proper balancing to make them fun by lasting long enough, but not ridiculously hard, especially with AI party members.\n- A horrible, horrible, horrible equipment system. Equipment now have random stats and random skills within a certain algorithm that makes it a chore to choose. Not only that, you'll have to do a weapon crafting system by basically fusing the same weapons to make it better, though not all combinations are an improvement as it doesn't display what skills the gear would get until after. Frustrating.\n- Has chosen the poorly done road of forced party members, limiting customization, strategies, and playstyle. You HAVE to have two human characters in your party to fight as a full four, otherwise you will only fight with two. This is pretty annoying, especially when the one human female keeps leaving at random points in the game (and later on NEVER COMING BACK, what the hell, I thought you were the heroine that wants to get their hands dirty to help save the world). I just want my magic knight class back.\n- No jumping in combat. Yep. Goodbye super awesome aerial combos.\n- Characters aren't really likable, they're pretty stiff and stereotypical in their archetype. Hell, Graces F had one of the worse stories, but better (well, selectively) characters that are much more well liked. Jade is top tier husbando material and Pascal is top tier waifu material that forgets who you are.\n- Combat now happens in where you encountered the enemy, rather than taking you to a seperate closed off, but cleared area. This makes it a seamless transition, only...not all areas of the game is designed for combat. More often than not, your camera will get stuck in a wall and you will be forced to look at the ground. Camera control is absolutely rubbish, it completely focuses on your target, rather than zooming out to have view of both your character and the target, leaving you sometimes to be lost, camera stuck in the wall, or the ground, or all of the above.\n- Skits (where characters talk amongst each other on certain situations or points of the story) seem to have been cut down significantly, only happening at save points or map points of interest. Kind of lost the flavour of character interaction and development.\n\nOverall, there's a lot more in the cons section than the pros, but thats only because I've played Tales of games since I was a kid, I had a lot of experience of which one were good and clicked with me and ones that didn't, so don't let the small pros to cons ratio fool you. The game is okay, a solid 6/10, kind of bueno, but nothing that will ever top Tales of Symphonia, Vesperia, or Abyss, the latter being my most favourite for its characters, story, and character development (please play the PS2 version, the 3DS adds nothing but a smaller screen to look at). This game is worth looking into, but probably better to pick it up at a sale, spend the rest of your money on previously mentioned Tales of games for a better experience.\n\nP.S. Namco Bandai, please learn how to properly manage your promotional materials, falsely advertising that Alisha is the main heroine then ditch her in favour of someone else and then blaming the fanbase for their misconception is bad, especially when she was everywhere with Sorey when the game was first announced. The game characters even thought they had started to develop romantic feelings for each other, so much as to visit each other's room at night. If thats not misleading, then I don't know what is.","October 27, 2015","true","57.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashrua/recommended/351970/","ashrua","acev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashrua/","71 products in account","As a big fan of the Tales of... series, my excitement for this game maintained its high ranking throughout the year. Finding out it was going to be on Steam definitely interested me, and I have to say that the inclusion of more platforms proved to be a good decision.\n\nIn general, Tales of Zestiria returns to older Tales of... formulas and improves upon the newer battle systems introduced in Tales of Graces, Tales of Xillia, and Tales of Xillia 2. I would honestly say this game contains a good mix of new and old Tales of... games. Tales of Zestiria contains a much more open world than Tales of.. games of late, which was nice to see after the linear world of Graces, Xillia, and Xillia 2. I actually felt like I was exploring vast areas in Zestiria, which really added to the experience. Unfortunately, the world in Tales of Zestiria still feels smaller compared to older Tales of... games, as I don't feel as I'm venturing throughout the world, moreso venturing through a continent. However, this drawback stems from the style the developers are going for, so it's necessarily a system needed to be perfected, rather than a flaw in this particular game.\n\nThe battle system in Tales of Zestiria certainly expands on Tales of Graces rather than Tales of Xillia, as evidenced by the lack of TP or another MP-based battle system. In addition, A-Artes and B-Artes return as Martial Artes and Hidden Artes for humans, and Hidden Artes and Seraphic Artes for Seraphim. This makes the battle system seem awfully familiar to Tales of Graces, and really, it's a fun system. In addition, the game allows Seraphim and Humans to combine, creating a stronger playable entity which will completely destroy certain enemies. This game isn't easy unless you master this battle system, so the overpowered entity really assists the difficulty curve. Unfortunately, the camera definitely does not agree with many battles, and while the seamless transition from field to battle is nice, I don't believe the game was ready for that transition until the camera issue was solved.\n\nThe overall gameplay system also really expands upon itself, mainly stemming from the fusion system. The fusion system in this game, which allows one to work with different skills, really expands upon the battle system. The goal to becoming stronger in this game lies more in what skills one has, rather than how much attack or defense a certain piece of equipment holds. Until one learns this system, the game can be penalizing on harder difficulties.\n\nThere's so much more I could talk about, but really, it all comes down to personal preference. Tales of Zestiria really boils down to whether one wants to have a fun time playing an RPG with a fun action battle system, or not. While I found the story to be entertaining, I can see why many don't care for it, as it's a commonplace Tales of.. game story. However, the characters are enjoyable to watch, the story was fun to watch unfold, and the gameplay was phenomenal. I definitely recommend this game if you enjoyed any other Tales of... game, or if you enjoy real-time battle systems.","October 29, 2015","true","68.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please beware!\n\nStarting with the cons:\n- 30 FPS, for some it is, for some it isn't a con, decide for yourself.\n- Bad combat camera.\n- Overall unintuitive combat and skill system.\n- Some characters are just bald and unmemorable, sadly.\n----SPOILER-----\n- No real plot twist i came to expect from tales games? If you're just paying a little attention you'll know whats going on, no big shocker.\n---- END SPOILER -----\n\nPros\n- Tales of Game on PC, want to see more hopefully better\n- Soundtrack and Cutscenes are well done.\n- The memorable and likable characters make up for the opposing ones.\n- Skits are good but their placement is... not so good.\n\nAll in all, even if this review seems rather negative, i REALLY enjoied the game. Of course it isn't the best Tales of Game there is, but it is solid, with a few flaws.\n\nI also have to say I had no techincal difficulties besides sometimes a bit of screentearing.\n\nI'll give it a solid 6.5-7/10, there are better games, but there are far more bad games!\n\nHope my review helped you!","October 25, 2015","true","46.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the other reviews explain what is great about this game very well.    So in this review I'm going to summerize the major issues.   I feel these issues hurt the game-feel and break immersion.  Hopefully this could help people determine wheather this game is still worth it to them.  My biggest gripes with this game are down to the  environments, animations, gameworld interactivity.\n\nThe environments are terribly bland in most areas.  The ground and wall textures are very low resolution most of the time apart from the stone floors of ruins, which have designs and patterns on them.  The character models look great it's just a shame the rest of the world doesn't.  The lack of any foliage and loosely scattered trees was very unexpected coming from a ps4 game.  It would have made the world feel a lot more vibrant even with some more general foliage.\n\nThe animations of monsters outside and (sometimes) inside of battle a very abrupt.  Landing a preemtive strike was nearly impossible for me the first 20 hours of the game until I got used to the jerky animations.  If your playing ToZ vanilla at 30 fps, it can be pretty hard to predict enemy movements in battle.  This is an essencial part of the gameplay mechanics since dodging and blocking at the right moment gives you huge benifits in battle.  Plus playing at 30 fps can be really diffcult since you have even less time to react to the very fast enemy attacks.\n\nI enjoyed interacting with the various party members and listening to their mediocre (but punny dialogue).  On the other hand the gameworld itself has very few ways you can interact with it.  Most of the interactable objects throughout the world will be question marks, (???) these are 4 abilities you gain later in the game that help you progress past whatever obstacle was in your way.  Besides talking to people this is your only way to interact with the world.  This system reminds me of a metroidvania style game but very, VERY, poorly done.   Press a direction on the d-pad, and you've solved the puzzle.\n\nSorry for the little rant, just though it would be important for people to understand some of the issues with this game, although I would recommend it for its combat.","December 3, 2015","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You kind of take this amount of time to get out of the first zone.\nThe overall quality of the game seems good, but not as good as I was wishing for it to be.\nI feel like they could have done a better job with the shading and if you look at some characters, their faces are painted on and it feels just off to see them in their clothing then. The clothes stick out so much, that's not how it should be.\n\nI really like the battle-system in the game, huge variety there for each character. So there is pretty much nothing I can think bad of as of now.\nThe fact that you can find cosmetic items in the standard game is really nice and not only via DLC.\n\nGame runs butter smooth, had no lag issues/frames issues at all and I don't think it will ever get to this point, because the game environment is low poly and only certain characters have high res textures which is fine.\n\nThat's it so far from me, thanks.","November 10, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Live action combat tied with a combo system like no other. The equipment system is also really well done. Only problem is sometimes in environments the camera can lag a little behind. Last but not least I would play this with a controller. I am using a DS4 which has a slight issue with this game. Sometimes while still connected to the program I use to use it, it will just stop working in game until I plug it in. 3rd party problem most likely the cause.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/recommended/351970/","mahodo","General Lee Aroused","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/","1002 products in account","One of the weaker mothership Tales of games in the series, right next to Tales of Symphonia 2. Continuing the tradition of introducing something really cool in its previous mothership title (in this case, Xillia/Xillia 2's dual raid battle system), but choosing to not take any of its successful elements and incorporate new experimental elements that is rather shakey in its introduction. It did take Graces F's/Destiny's unique style shift battle system, but severely limiting its options through poor choices, one of which was initially not displaying a numerical value of SC required to attack with a specific move while in battle. This makes judging the cost of which combos you want to pull off to a rather vague sense of estimation, though this can be helped by just keeping your SC high (admittedly not a good design choice though).\n\nThe premise so far for the initial story is interesting, but only for the first 2 hours of the game. You play as Sorey (or later Rose), the main character and the chosen Shepard who pulls out the sacred sword (AKA Excalibur) and is given the task of purifying the world of yomas and unify the human and seraphim race into cohabitation. There's a few parts of the story here and there that try to emulate a moral choice, something Xillia 2 did well, but only because it had a silent main character. Zestiria's main character has a clear personaility and when picking a choice, it didn't seem to have much impact as the character simply brushes it off with an ugly "EH" kind of feeling. Gee, for a hero, you're kinda hard to like. The moral choices presented are also pretty weird, for example, you can fix a bridge with earth magic, but you are given a choice, do you want to fix it in front of the people in distress to try to be a hero symbol, or do it when everyone leaves? I choose the "look really cool in front of everyone" and only ONE PERSON reacted with an "oh, okay". Then everyone tells me I was wrong to try to inspire people that there is hope in piety because they would instead take me for a monster that is trying to help them. Goddammit, what do you people want from me.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Utilizing divine weapons as a focus, your human characters can basically temporarily fuse with your seraphim party members to create a new combat form depending on fusion members, something akin to Digimon. Pretty neat, but I wish the fusion character actually looked different for each form, rathern than just a colour pallete and weapon change.\n- Dual audio! Never bad to have a choice, especially when it lets me run away from awkward English dub, its usually a hit or miss on the voice acting charts (such as Abyss and Symphonia being superior in English over Japanese).\n- Pretty decent PC port, was rather shakey at the start, but easily fixable if you look around. Japanese games rarely have good PC ports, so this was a surprise.\n\nCONS:\n- A weird varying degree of difficulty at the start. Normal enemies are incredibly easy fights that they last only 12-16 seconds on moderate difficulty, but boss fights demolish you in 2-3 hits and take a lot longer. I tried to remedy this by bumping up the difficulty on the field for normal encounters, then down for boss encounters, but not all boss fight encounters are obvious. Difficulty level need some proper balancing to make them fun by lasting long enough, but not ridiculously hard, especially with AI party members.\n- A horrible, horrible, horrible equipment system. Equipment now have random stats and random skills within a certain algorithm that makes it a chore to choose. Not only that, you'll have to do a weapon crafting system by basically fusing the same weapons to make it better, though not all combinations are an improvement as it doesn't display what skills the gear would get until after. Frustrating.\n- Has chosen the poorly done road of forced party members, limiting customization, strategies, and playstyle. You HAVE to have two human characters in your party to fight as a full four, otherwise you will only fight with two. This is pretty annoying, especially when the one human female keeps leaving at random points in the game (and later on NEVER COMING BACK, what the hell, I thought you were the heroine that wants to get their hands dirty to help save the world). I just want my magic knight class back.\n- No jumping in combat. Yep. Goodbye super awesome aerial combos.\n- Characters aren't really likable, they're pretty stiff and stereotypical in their archetype. Hell, Graces F had one of the worse stories, but better (well, selectively) characters that are much more well liked. Jade is top tier husbando material and Pascal is top tier waifu material that forgets who you are.\n- Combat now happens in where you encountered the enemy, rather than taking you to a seperate closed off, but cleared area. This makes it a seamless transition, only...not all areas of the game is designed for combat. More often than not, your camera will get stuck in a wall and you will be forced to look at the ground. Camera control is absolutely rubbish, it completely focuses on your target, rather than zooming out to have view of both your character and the target, leaving you sometimes to be lost, camera stuck in the wall, or the ground, or all of the above.\n- Skits (where characters talk amongst each other on certain situations or points of the story) seem to have been cut down significantly, only happening at save points or map points of interest. Kind of lost the flavour of character interaction and development.\n\nOverall, there's a lot more in the cons section than the pros, but thats only because I've played Tales of games since I was a kid, I had a lot of experience of which one were good and clicked with me and ones that didn't, so don't let the small pros to cons ratio fool you. The game is okay, a solid 6/10, kind of bueno, but nothing that will ever top Tales of Symphonia, Vesperia, or Abyss, the latter being my most favourite for its characters, story, and character development (please play the PS2 version, the 3DS adds nothing but a smaller screen to look at). This game is worth looking into, but probably better to pick it up at a sale, spend the rest of your money on previously mentioned Tales of games for a better experience.\n\nP.S. Namco Bandai, please learn how to properly manage your promotional materials, falsely advertising that Alisha is the main heroine then ditch her in favour of someone else and then blaming the fanbase for their misconception is bad, especially when she was everywhere with Sorey when the game was first announced. The game characters even thought they had started to develop romantic feelings for each other, so much as to visit each other's room at night. If thats not misleading, then I don't know what is.","October 27, 2015","true","57.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The "Monoliths" that are spread throughout the game are an ongoing tutorial that begins to drag forever, and it can be VERY EASY to forget many of the helpful features due to their sheer number. Some refinement could have been used to make the game simpler, though as stated above these features and mechanics are at least integrated well. The big IF here is whether or not you have the ability to coordinate your battle and your character(s) like a symphony orchestra conductor.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game that is barely held back by any of its trivial flaws. If you're looking for a lengthy action-RPG with excellent story, you can't go wrong here. Also, it's an RPG on Steam. Buy more of these, and Steam will have more of them.

Did I enjoy it? I'd say yes but no Tales game has such a disparate list what it did well and what it did poorly.\n\nCombatZestiria's combat is similar to most 3D Tales games. You move either closer to or further from your enemy as you attack them with a diverse range of attacks and spells. Like Tales of Graces, it allows for sidestepping and does away with TP. Instead, all attacks are flashy artes that deplete a stamina meter.\n\nCombat itself is deep and thoughtful. There are several enemy archtypes and each requires a different approach. Each individual playable character controls differently and you can switch between them in combat to adapt a fighting style.\n\nZestiria features a pair up mechanic similar to Xillia but vastly improved. Rather than one character just following the other's lead, they act independently. Instead, they can fuse through a mechanic called Armatization. It opens a lot of interesting combat options up. Whether it be fusing to exploit a weakness, consolidate into a stronger enemy target, reviving a partner through a fusion, or splitting apart to dodge an attack, it all feels great.\n\nStill, there are a few flaws. New attacks are unlocked and it really makes the variety feel lacking in the early game. Additionally, magic seems more overpowered than in previous iterations. Sometimes an attack will interupt magic, other times it will only speed up the cast.\n\nMost importantly, the friendly AI is probably the worst I've seen it. Your teammates have no sense of spacing despite strategies. They rarely show an inclination to block and get themselves killed frequently. That they can fuse and cause 2 deaths for the price of one makes it all the worse. It can get incredibly frustrating to watch and I ultimately found myself setting them to not blow their combat resources and healing them frequently. It makes me think this game would be far more fun as a co-op game.\n\nGameplayZestiria uses an open world approach that feels amazing. Traversing the world feels good and cutscenes require no transitions. Rather, the camera elegantly shifts and lets the action unfurl from where your characters stand. Entering combat similarly happens by touching an enemy and hopping back into a combat stance. It ends up feeling beautifully cohesive and is something I hope future games keep.\n\nCharacters develop in the classic RPG fashion. You gain XP/Levels through fights and equip better equipment as you go. As you level you unlock more moves, making combat more interesting and varied. The big gripe here is the skill system. It's convoluted, grindy, and not the easiest to manipulate. Each piece of equipment comes with skills attached. As you stack skills of the same name, type, or element you gain either bonus stats or a bonus skill. Manipulating these to get what you want requires grinding, use of a item fusion mechanic that doesn't seem to obviate how skills transfer, and finding one time use NPCs that can confer a specific skill on a piece of equipment. It's excessively complex and is probably the worst element of the game.\n\nDungeons are for the most part right angled ruins. There's occasionally a clever puzzle here and there but there's generally not much to write home about here. Gameplay wise I don't feel like they subtract much save the water dungeon. It's a dungeon built with motion detectors that warp you back to the beginning of the dungeon. The quick save mechanic reduces the pain, but it's still horrendous design.\n\nA fast travel mechanic helps drop the trek time which is appreciated. It's occasionally unavailable, but that's always due to needing to encounter a cutscene on the way to your goal.\n\nSidequests are easily accessible by simply talking to your party members. You also get the flavor of the world and where other sidequests might be from banter you hear in town as you walk around.\n\nPlotThe setting of the plot is probably one of the most novel in a Tales game. The world is comprised of ordinary humans and spirit like creatures known as seraphim that most humans are oblvious to. Sorey, the MC, is a human raised in a village of seraphim and is the rare human who can perceive seraphim. This ultimately leads to him becoming the Shepard. A figure of legend who mediates between the two races and purges the world of malevolance caused by fallen humans and seraphim alike. It's a different player perspective than any other Tales game has provided and it feels fresh.\n\nThe character unfortunately mostly underwhelm. Sorey is a competent and sometimes surprisingly mature main but there isn't much of a character arc nor is he terribly interesting. In being the Shephard, his design is that he's a near uncorruptable, pure, and just character. He has some personality which helps, but he's basically shackled from any meaningful change. Other human members are better as while similarly uncorruptable, have interesting spins on why. They're also pretty charismatic.\n\nThe seraphim party members on the other hand are all pretty bland. They all experience next to know character development so what you see is what you get. They mostly devolve into trope-like caricatures which hurts. A lot of them had setup or back story to be genuinely interesting but ultimately none of it was capitalized on.\n\nThe story itself is about average. It does a good job of taking you through a variety of locales and rationalizes near everything that happens with the plot extremely well. It also presents a lot of epic scenarios that were a joy to play. Still, due to the lack of development in the characters there's no real feeling of gravity for the player behind the events.\n\nAgain, it's a competent but not great story. I didn't feel it hurt the game but I also don't think it added much.\n\nSoundThe sound direction for this game is outstanding and easily the best in the entire Tales of series. It's strong praise but it's deserving. The orchestration is beautiful and small decisions like not switching to a different combat theme in dungeons goes a long, long way. Several of the dungeons were legitimately more enjoyable due to atmosphere and tension and music underscores them with.\n\nThe fire dungeon's energetic theme meshes with the lava filled environment. The water dungoen's piano heavy orchestra fits with the more intellectually based challenge posed in the plot to Sorey. The final dungeon theme leaves the area dripping with a sense of ominous tension.\n\nConclusion\nZestiria isn't perfect. It has a lot of flaws and some of them are major. The skill system feels bad, friendly AI performs poorly, and plot isn't the best offering of the series. Still for all those things it does so very much right. The open world is beautiful and cohesive. The combat is one of the most varied and legitimately fun entries in recent memory. Not to mention, the soundtrack is the best of the series hands down.\n\nFor all the things I disliked, I loved the things it did well enough to brush those issues aside. It honestly gives me a lot of hope for the future of the franchise. If you enjoy the Tales series or are just itching for a JRPG, it's worth playing.","November 7, 2015","true","46.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, the story is not particulary captivating but at least it gives you an adult vibe. There are no characters whose only role is to repeat last said words with a puzzled look on their faces when everything is decided by others. Nothing is done blindly because someone said to do it, everything is evaluated and actions taken with consequences in mind.\n\n2. Battle system might seem overcomplicated, especially in the beginning but later you start to appreciate its flexibility. A lot of different monsters require different tactics so there is a necessity to adapt. There is also an easy mode if you only want the story.\n\n3. All girls are best girls.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Graphics are bad, like very bad. The game looks worse than FF XII, yes, twelve. Giant bland levels which you have to travel across over and over.\n\n2. Speaking of traveling. The game forces upon you an insane amount of backtracking. I lost count how many times I visited more populated central regions. It's common to travel for 15 minutes to see 30 seconds cutscene and then go back the same way. It wouldn't be so bad if the game looked decent but... see 1.\n\n3. Overlocalization and mistranslation. A lot of lines are mistranslated for no apparent reason. The message is delivered but overlocalized. Just a couple of lines from memory: two guards say to each other: "Let's go drink" - "Ah, with pleasure" but it's translated as "Let's go drink" - "Anything to get off this armor". Why? No reason at all. Lailah often compassionly repeats the protagonist name but it always translated differently, like "that is so" or "you do, don't you" etc. The game is full of humour but it's not delivered due to horrible translation job. Puns fall flat because lines make no sense or just simply not funny. Also it's the game in medieval settings, why put so many modern idioms? It breaks the immersion.\n\n\nOverall I give it 6/10. After all I've said I still like the game, I just wish I knew japanese better to play without the subs, I would have definitely enjoyed it more.","November 8, 2015","true","55.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Zestiria plays dramatically different than what you are use to. Although the changes at face value don't seem that different, it certainly will be a culture shock to say the least. I enjoyed Zestiria all the way through, it was well written and a welcome return to the series. If I could point out one flaw I would say that it feels like it's lacking something. Compared to the previous Tales of Titles there is quite a bit less game to play. The major cities are smaller, some minor characters had more buildup than party members, and some party members disappear due to plot reasons and never reappear again. Previous Tales of Titles have done the disappearing party member sure, but they always returned in time for the end of the plot. Unfortunately Zestiria doesn't do this, and at least to me, it kinda feels like I was cheated just a bit. Now don't get me wrong, Zestiria is a fantastic game, I enjoyed every moment of it. However it falls flat when compared to its predecessors. I’m glad to see the Tales of Series get a reboot, and I'm excited to see more. But we should demand more. Buy this game, play it and enjoy. But make sure you remind the Development team what you want. Remind them of the standard they have set in the past, so with the money they get from Zestiria, they can get this reboot back to the quality it should be.","November 6, 2015","true","36.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So far the game is really good. The music is really good, I've found some tracks I like a lot. But...I can't say this is my favorite Tales Of game, and from what I know, I don't think it will become it either. The battle system isn't as good as Hearts R or Graces F (Those are my two favorites of the series. Still really want to play Vesperia but haven't had the chance) and I'm not a fan of the human/seraphim difference.....but the biggest problem lies in how Alisha leaves the party (And early on to boot). This leaves the game giving you only 2 humans. That's not even enough to switch to someone else. Not to mention I don't really like Rose much.\n\nThe story is great but the gameplay seems kind of bland compared to others Tales games. In others, you must switch party members and do without people for a while....here....well you don't really have that except for the crucible locations. Also, for some reason, I just don't feel a desire to try playing the other characters in this game. Xillia 2 had Gaia that was fun to play as, and Xillia 1 and 2 both had Elise which could be fun if you get good at toggling Teepo. (I had an interest in Muzet but forgot why. I think it was a good balance and good aero combat character). Hearts R and Graces F both had a bunch of fun characters. But Zestiria, they don't really work so different from each other (At least as far as I know).\n\nHopefully the next 2 Tales Of games in development will turn out better. Please don't make this mistake again. I'm ok with a party member leaving, but give us enough different people to replace them with. Two humans just doesn't cut it.  Still a great game but there are better Tales Of games out there for people getting into the series.\n\n*Edit*\nI have now beat the game.  I'd say it's the best game for 2015.  But still not as good as Graces F or Hearts R but still great.  Now I'm trying to find things to do post game outside of the DLC (I do have it though).","November 6, 2015","true","72.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Abyss and Vesperia are still tied for my favourite, Tales of Xillia 2 coming in close second, this game's probably 3rd place. It's good, but not great. Biggest complaint so far is the seemingly arbitrary choices AND the main character Sorey is kind of lame, his fighting style is incredibly bland and generic until you get the Armatus's, then it opens up a little bit, but the combos are still pretty spammy and lacklustre, The mystic artes are just plain laughable compared to previous titles,\nin other games you summon like a ♥♥♥♥ing tsunami followed by dropping THE SUN on someones head, in this it's like:\n"I hit you with my sword..... Twice! Really Hard!"\nThankfully the game makes up for it with pretty hillarious and witty dialogue and fantastic humor, it's a fun game, but if you aint a diehard fan like me, you might want to wait til it's on sale.\nOn the plus side the music is ♥♥♥♥ing FANTASTIC, I'd even go so far as to say it has some of the best music in the series, the dungeon songs in paticular are so memorable and FULLY orchestrated, Symphony of the Night-tier here people.\nSpeaking of dungeons, the dungeons puzzles suck, we're talking Ocarina of Time Water Temple kind of suck.\nNot even remotely hard in the slightest, just tedious, boring and obnoxious.\nAlso, here's a quote:\n"Hell yeah!

Most of the other reviews explain what is great about this game very well.    So in this review I'm going to summerize the major issues.   I feel these issues hurt the game-feel and break immersion.  Hopefully this could help people determine wheather this game is still worth it to them.  My biggest gripes with this game are down to the  environments, animations, gameworld interactivity.\n\nThe environments are terribly bland in most areas.  The ground and wall textures are very low resolution most of the time apart from the stone floors of ruins, which have designs and patterns on them.  The character models look great it's just a shame the rest of the world doesn't.  The lack of any foliage and loosely scattered trees was very unexpected coming from a ps4 game.  It would have made the world feel a lot more vibrant even with some more general foliage.\n\nThe animations of monsters outside and (sometimes) inside of battle a very abrupt.  Landing a preemtive strike was nearly impossible for me the first 20 hours of the game until I got used to the jerky animations.  If your playing ToZ vanilla at 30 fps, it can be pretty hard to predict enemy movements in battle.  This is an essencial part of the gameplay mechanics since dodging and blocking at the right moment gives you huge benifits in battle.  Plus playing at 30 fps can be really diffcult since you have even less time to react to the very fast enemy attacks.\n\nI enjoyed interacting with the various party members and listening to their mediocre (but punny dialogue).  On the other hand the gameworld itself has very few ways you can interact with it.  Most of the interactable objects throughout the world will be question marks, (???) these are 4 abilities you gain later in the game that help you progress past whatever obstacle was in your way.  Besides talking to people this is your only way to interact with the world.  This system reminds me of a metroidvania style game but very, VERY, poorly done.   Press a direction on the d-pad, and you've solved the puzzle.\n\nSorry for the little rant, just though it would be important for people to understand some of the issues with this game, although I would recommend it for its combat.","December 3, 2015","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I wasn't playing second player off of my friend's ps4 and played single player on PC I quickly realized this game is much better solo as it realies on the armatization and seraphim for the majority of the games combat and that the main character Sorey ultimately becomes more likable after the first anime cutscene. I can think back to my favorite tales of game in the series; Symphonia and the main character Lloyd Irving. Now Lloyd wasn't the brightest guy and hell he couldn't even make a sandwhich, but what he lacked in sharp smarts he made up with his undying morally strong ideals. He believed in a world in which everyone could live happy and that no one was born for the sole purpose of dying. I have to say a little bit of Lloyd I can see in Sorey even if he isn't my favorite character in the game (Edna). So the point is if you like RPGs and you never played or know of the tales of series, definately give this one a try.","October 23, 2015","true","57.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed it a lot! The plot is (kind of) standard RPG fare but (like a lot of Tales of games) its characters are basically what keep you playing. It's what kept me playing at least! The battle system is like a lot of Tales games - it can be really repetitive and you could button mash half the time and still do okay... but you know, it's addicting in its own way if you're into grinding and all that.\n\nThe only con I'd have for this game is the AI - it's super terrible. It's made even worse by the fact that you're rewarded Grade based on how you did in a fight and... you (or your Ai-controlled buddies) getting KO'd takes a good chunk out of that Grade.\n\nOh and OST is great....","November 1, 2015","true","71.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much of this game consists of overly large areas with high ceilings, but said spaces feel empty when there's little but one or two enemies to occupy them. The cities look all too uniform, with no real distinguishing features to set them apart from one another, and this only gets worse inside building-dungeons, where the color schemes of the walls/floors/ceilings are so similar that you feel like falling asleep just looking at them.\n\nThe game is locked at 30FPS, and this doesn't have much effect on the game. However, there are times when it's quite noticable, like in the animations of distant enemies, as well as a close up few enemies with particularly fast animations (bats for instance). Minor graphical glitches are evident, but not more than you'd expect from a new release. Aside from that, it performs well. As an added bonus, the game supports resolution scaling tools like NVidia's DSR flawlessly.\n\nThat said, this game is a worthy successor to the "Tales of..." series (as well as a solid JRPG, something Steam is short on), and while it isn't my favorite of the lot, I feel like my money was well spent here. There's plenty of things to collect around every corner, from stat-boosting herbs to equipment-improving creatures called Normins. Difficulty can be raised or lowered at any time, and range from child-friendly levels to unfairly difficult.\n\nAnd in true JRPG fashion, don't sink too much love and grinding into the Aerith, because she leaves you at the end of disc 1.","November 1, 2015","true","72.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I spent 8 hours playing already today, and only took a break to get some food and write this review.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, this game has the best soundtrack I've heard in a long, long time.

The only way I could get this game to run is with a 3rd party community patch. A game IMHO should never be released in any such form! You have been warned. Go to the discussion board and get the community patch first.\n\nI have trouble reviewing this game because it divides me so much.\n\nI'll start with the positives by saying the game has a fantastic story and set of characters. All characters (annoying or not) are voiced well and likeable. The story is complex and so are the characters and there is a lot to love when the two coming together. This game does a great job of telling a story, as I think an RPG should.\n\nThe game has lots of great cut scenes, or mini cut scenes called skits. They do a great job of giving characters thoughts, ideas, and expressions in a fun anime like way. It's kind of a unique system that I've never seen and it just adds a lot I think.\n\nThey also have an Anime based on the game in the works, would totally watch.\n\nAs great as the story and character are, which really hold the game together, the game has issues.\n\nEven with the community patch, the game does have some graphical issues during combat. Certain effects cause massive graphical slowdown on a GTX 970, which shouldn't happen. Then again the game wouldn't even run for me without a community patch.\n\nThe camera in the game does not work exactly as you would expect. It turns super slow. You will adapt mostly, but it's just something that is so weird it's worth mentioning because you will battle it all game.\n\nOne thing that was kind of good / bad is you lose a major character like 1/3 of the way through the game. It's not that it really changes anything it's just a really bizarre thing like they started making the game and decided they didn't really want this character to be in the game and then hastily wrote them out. Although the game's director downplays this, it seems almost evident.\n\nThe combat system is overly complex, but here is an “easy mode” if you wish to take some of the complexity out of the game. It gets easier the more you play it but sill takes a bit of time before you can really confidently fight “epic” type monsters and survive. The few strong enemies will clean your clock though, and it drives down the fun value.\n\nThere are a few times where you will not have clear goals and need to basically wander around until you discover where you are suppose to go. Some better hints would be nice rather than wasting literally hours of my time trying to figure out where to go. Wasting players time should not be considered good. It is a tactic used by bad games to extend their play time. It really kills the pacing of the game.\n\n\nTLDR;\nOverall the game is above average in terms of story, and the characters are great. It's a shame however that the game suffers from poor pacing and other problems that really just make it a mediocre game. The game tries to do too much and stretches out too long for the content included.\n\nI'd say play it with tempered expectations going in, it's an interesting game but it's not going to probably make your “greatest RPGs ever” list.","January 31","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A hero shall come forth, and save us all!" It´s probably debirately made like that to be like a throwback to older games with a "simple and basic" plot. It´s nothing new, but it is executed nicely. Feels old school, made to feel old school. Typical? Yes. But that isn´t the same as bad. I do think that it tries too hard with the "Not everything´s black and white" thing, but it´s plainly obvious to see who´s bad and who´s good.\nAs for the characters, even if some cliché and cookie cutter for some people (see that Sorey´s the typical MC, a goodie two shoes that can´t stand to help others in need), they were made like the story, to feel that type of nostalgia. I personally enjoyed the characters, and specially their chemistry together, and there is memorable characters, and they had some quirks that made them sort of unique. Yes, it may not have better characters than other Tales of games, like Tals of the Abyss, but the cast was enjoyable.\nBattle system didn´t appeal to me much. Just me probably? It´s quite simmilar to Xillia´s, but... The camera angles made it a bit hard to keep up wit the battle, and the armatization made it mandatory for the party to be made of two seraphim and two humans, wich takes away variety.\nSoundtrack was great, but not many tracks are memorable, except maybe the Trial Shrine´s and Artorius Throne´s. The opening (with vocals, as I replaced the instrumental version with it) is one of my favourite Tales of openings. "But it doesn´t fit Tales Of!" Just my taste in music.\nAnimated cut scenes are amazing, but this is Ufotable we´re talking about, so...\nGraphics are one of the best I´ve seen when it comes to JRPGs, and the 30fps lock can be removed with mods. Best Tales Of Graphics so far (obviously, it´s the newest game, so it clearly was gonna have better visuals.)\nAs many flaws it has, it is enjoyable, and a lot of fun. Starting a New Game + will give you a new set of dungeons, and cameos from other entries in the series, wich adds more fun.\n\nIf you like JRPGs, you should really buy this game. Not the best out there, but really enjoyable! If you want to get into Tales of, maybe this is where you should start.","December 13, 2015","true","69.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It isn't my first pick for a game to play, but I'd play it for days when I do. If you don't like some monotony/grinding,  then why are you playing RPGs?  this game is not for you.\n\nIn comparison to other Tales games, this is missing somethings and has some issues. However, it does have a place, and it will comfortable sit in my Tales collection, racking up hours like nobody's business, just like every other Tales game.\n\nI'm happy with my purchase, but I'm on the fence with recommending this. Like I said, it can get grindy, which puts people off. But there is plenty of content in-game and post-game. I'm going to say yes, I recommend this, but be prepared. I would actually say that you wait for a sale before you decide to pick this up.\n_________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nStory:\n\nJourney through the continent of Glenwood, purging evil in the land! You play as Sorey, a bright-eyed, ruin-loving youth, his adoptive brother, Mikleo, and others who dare to purify evil with them.\n\nThis is a fairly basic story. They set out to cleanse evil, and they do so. What more could you want?\n\n...Well, actually plenty. But it's a servicable story, and there is nothing wrong with it. I just wished it had some more to it.\n\n5/10 (Average)\n\n\n\nCharacters:\n\nIn a humorous statement:\nWe've got a ruin maniac, an invisible ruin maniac with control over water, Princess Not-Mary-Sue, a plucky assassin, a rocking sarcastic loli, Pun-Mistress Turbo (She's on Fire), Professor Wind, and that funny guy that's simultaneously awesome.\n\n\nBut yeah. These characters, while summed up rather crudely, are quite memorable for their interactions, as are most  Tales of  games. I've thoroughly enjoyed my time with these characters, and I'll probably remember them more than others in other games/VNs I've done so far. I just wished that they would have fleshed them out some more.\n\n7/10 (Pretty good stuff)\n\n\nLore:\n\nWe've got the paragon of good, and the epitome of evil; the Shepard and the Wolves that threaten it. Well its actually not wolves but that's the idea.\n\n\nLORE DUMP INBOUND!!!\n\n\nThere are three beings that exist on the continent of Glenwood:\nHumans (SURPRISE!! :D)\nSeraphim\nHellions\n\n\n\nHumans are what you expect. You know, because we are human.\n\nSeraphim are beings who are similar to humans, possessing great powers and significantly longer lifespans but only perceivable by a select few who are capable.\n\nHellions are either Humans or Seraphim that have become corrupted by evil; malevolence. They can be purified of their evil by a certain group of humans and seraphim.\n\nThese humans who can purify are referred to as Shepards. The Shepards use the power of the Seraphim to purify malevolence. There are two categories of Seraphim in reference to the Shepard: the Prime Lord and the Sub-Lord. The Prime Lord is the one who enables the Shepard to purify, and Sub-Lords are those who have bound themselves to subservience to the Prime Lord, allow the Shepard to wield their power and giving those Seraphim the ability to purify as well. Other humans can gain the power to purify in addition to the Shepards. They are known as Squires - they only make pacts to become bound the Shepard.\n\nIt is the duty of the Shepards to quell Hellions by quelling the source: the Lord of Calamity - your wolf to your Shepard.\n\n\nI think it's fairly solid lore. Wish they would expand it some more, but this is plenty enough for decent lore.\n\nLore: 7/10\n\n\nOverworld:\nHoly crap this is an actual overworld! Everything is scaled up to match the player models on screen. It can feel lifeless at times with the lack to fauna skittering around, but that's where the Hellions come into play - they appear on the world as the fauna, and can be engage in combat.\n\nLast two times I saw an expansive satisfactory overworld was in Skyrim and Middle-Earth: SoM\n\nOverworld: 7/10\n\n\nCombat\nI'm not going to get detailed here.\n\nIt's servicable and I had fun with it, and what crazy combos you can pull off. Try it for yourself. If you are a returning Tales fan, it closely resembles Graces/f\n\nThing to note though:\n\nIt's a triangle advantage/disadvantage system for the artes.\n\nMartial > Seraphic > Hidden > Martial ...\n\n\nIf you were wondering about the keyboard controls vs. controller feel, it works. The controls in-game can be rebinded to different keys/buttons. Its actually surprisingly intuitive.\n\nCombat: 6/10 (Above Average)\n\n\nPerformance\nThis old beast of mine runs smoothly without the uncapped FPS mod at 30 FPS. I'm satisfied.

Its a good mix of light hearted fun and character development, plus  I was always wanting to explore and uncover the story.The variety of enemies and optional boss fights and dungeons really helped extend my playtime. The character interactions were a treat as well. There is at least one good Wifu.\n\nThere are a few things though that really makes the game suffer.\n1.The weapon mechiancs of the game (Fusions) are pretty uninteresting, reading  around it looks like no one really gave a crap about them and you dont need to pay any attention to them to beat the game\n2. The difficulty settings were really a step in the wrong direction, the harder the difficulty you select for the game,the less EXP you will earn,you will earn more gald but you will just spend more time farming enemies to get to a higher level, the only challenge this creates is whether or not you have the patience to keep playing the same things over.\n3. I guess this was a big deal in Japan and resulted in the game getting enormous refunds, you dont get the best wifu..in  fact she's only with your party for a short time and then thats it...\n4. If you don't get the DLC for free or less then a few dollars, you are going to have a very disappointing time\n\nOverall if the game drops to a fair price like $20-25 , I would say without a doubt get it, you should enjoy it!","January 31","true","139.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a great Tales game to pick up if you're new to the series as it's not too long or grindy (Compared to some of the other games, you will still drop lots of hours in to complete this game) the combos are really easy to string together. Lots of different difficulties. I found the normal mode to be too easy.\n\nThe characters are alright, I'm enjoying the full cast more than the full cast of Vesperia. The AI is pretty awful in boss fights, I generally have to tell them to defend while I solo the boss. The story is a little lacking as well, not as long or as "compelling" as some of the other Tales game.\n\nAll in all though, this game is a fun time. There's lots of humour, lots of little side quests you can do. Combat flows pretty nicely. Good entry level Tales game, but keep in mind it's a long game compared to some others, and there's some stuff you'll have to learn when it comes to equipment and the 3 different types of "artes" and what it effective against what.","December 15, 2015","true","183.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll give you all the pros and cons based on ratings out of 10 Note: I'm writing on my mobile.\n\n- Art: the art style on the characters are on point. I believe that some textures on walls could be updated though. 6/10\n- Combat: this is a hard one, the combat is extremely confusing as there's so many different buttons to press. It's also good that you have to learn combos as most of the time button mashing deals little to no damage. The main problems is the awful camera controls. You have to keep pressing the RB (if using 360 controller) to lock onto the nearest target otherwise it looks a mess. 6/10\n\nCosmetics: they're pretty funny. You're allowed a suit and a hat as your main outfit then you can have accessories to go on top of the outfit such as wings etc. There's a lot of cosmetics from DLCs and by looting from chests. 8/10\n\nArmour: this is probably the most disappointing part, the armour doesn't display on your character. Bummer. All armour is basically the same name with a different prefix. 'Old' to 'Amber' etc. The armour at beginning game doesn't do a lot, I haven't progressed far enough to see if it's better at late game. 4/10\n\nWorld: The world is extremely large but this games world reminds me of a game called last revenant where it's all instanced, the instances are very large though. The world's can be very bland with a few scattered chests and trees but sometimes they can be very beautiful with castles etc. The dungeons are all different but are still all extremely empty. 6/10\n\nEnemies: There's a massive variety of enemies, from large bosses to small animals. All have their own attack patterns, weaknesses, strengths. 8.5/10\n\nCutscenes: there's two different types of cutscenes, one of them is from in-game and the other is the classic anime style. I can tell you now there's LOADS of cutscenes, almost around every corner, they are all skip panel though. They don't bother me too much as its a story game. The cutscenes art is glorious, sometimes the in-game cutscenes can be buggy. 6/10\n\nFPS: it's at 30, a very noticeable 30, there's already a fix for this. -/10\n\nProfessions: there's not really any professions in the game, you can choose a small selection of what you can do but it does everything automatically. 2/10\n\nExploration: Not a whole lot of exploring, the lands are very similar. 4/10\n\nReplay value: this depends, if you enjoy these games it can have an extremely high replay value. I can't see myself making more than one character. 7/10\n\nSaving: strange, there's saving points scattered on the map yet you can go in the menu and select quick save. The save is also not done by characters but by overall, so if you made s new game it would overwrite the previous save. 5/10\n\nStory: It's very generic and here's the rundown 'guy takes sword from the stone, finds then kills a guy'. There's a lot of background story and lots of elements so I make sure I watch every cutscenes. It might be generic but it's very manipulative. 6/10.\n\nUpgrading: to upgrade you have to either play with your equipment and it upgrades overtime or you can take it to a blacksmith and combine it with the same type of clothing. No weapon customisation. 4/10.\n\nI made it a thumbs up as for a JRPG it's the best non turned based you're going to get. Is it a dissapointment? Yes but no. I expected the game to look better and more current gen, it reminds me of an old xbox360 game called 'last revenant'. Is it worth £40? No way but it's 100% worth £20. This JRPG could have been made way better.","May 21","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I wouldn't say there's anything special about it. As a Tales game, it's probably one of the weaker ones. What I liked was that it was surprisingly dark. Children die, often the only redemption possible for people is through death, light doesn't triumph over dark, and humanity is generally awful. It makes for a really nice change. So, if you like JRPGs and the Tales series you will probably like this. It also has puns. The sheer amount they manage to fit in should be commended.\n\nDetailed:\n\nThe overarching plot is very simple, a village boy leaves home for the first time and is later tasked with defeating the Big Bad, which is done through trials to get the power necessary. Where this game shines is in its characters. Maybe due to the game's battle mechanics, but every character feels necessary. They also have unique personalities and their personal stories are explored throughout the game. The voice acting is decent and you really learn to love the characters. However if you play with English audio you'll frequently notice the character will stop talking but their sprite's mouth keeps moving for a good five seconds, which can be annoying.\n\nThe battle system can be pretty complicated at first, but it's very smooth once you get used to it. The new enemies are called 'hellions' and your job is to purify them (which gameplay-wise is just defeat them). There's the usual fire, water, earth, wind strong/weak system, but the hellions also have their own categories to consider. For example, a hellion might be a beast type, and you can get equipment which is more effective against beasts. The unique battle system here is 'Armatisation', where you combine with another person to get more HP and special powers. Combat can be challenging as often you can't just hack and slash your way through battles. but the amazing invention of the quick step (back step, front step and side step) make them feel fun.\n\nThe worst part of combat is the camera. Sometimes, it's a real ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf you're not smart, like me, the equipment system is very complicated. The basics are given to you, but its only through skits a lot of the information explained. To put it simply, one piece of equipment can have a maximum of 4 skills on it. You fuse equipment together to make it stronger and get better/different skills. By doing so, you can comfortably take on enemies which are 5-10 levels higher than you. There's also another dynamic, all about bonus skills which comes from E-Unions and links and other nonsense, but you don't need to know it well to play the game. Just randomly fusing everything together works well enough.\n\nIf you like skits, this game does have them, but they're only viewable in certain places and it's quite easy to miss some. My advice is to frequently stay at inns.\n\nRegarding the New Game+, the best thing to do to is to make sure your Lords of the Lands are at the highest level you can be bothered to get them to. Their level affects how many points you get at the end of the game, which affects what bonus things you get in New Game+. However, there is a lot of replayability in this game, like all Tales, as you get bonus dungeons and bosses.\n\nAs this game isn't as popular as the others, if you encounter any problems you will often struggle to find a solution and wind up having to work it out yourself. For example, I accidentally activated local co-op (which is only in battle) but I had no idea how I'd done it and there was no support anywhere which told me how to turn it on, let alone turn it off (FYI, you have to change whether their moves are auto, semi-auto or manual in the artes menu).\n\nOtherwise, it's okay.","May 25","true","138.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having 9 to 5 jobs, a kid who needs attention and household chores tend to do that to you, heh.\n\nAnyway, this would be my fifth Tales of - games since I entirely skipped PS3 Tales games library. I do tend to have Vesperia and Abyss standard concerning this franchise, and it ends up undermining (imho) other Tales games since Vesperia did almost everything so well with its stories, characters, and overall gameplay.\n\nNow, Tales of Zestiria is not bad, per se. But it somehow lacks in some areas. Don't get me wrong, the combat is great, that has been the highlights of Tales series RPGs, and it is, in my opinion, the best aspect of the game. I like the Normin system, weapon crafting (or fusion), how the world is presented in the game, and the graphics is quite good. The game runs flawlessly on my GTX 950M, where I played it mostly (my GTX 970 rig is not actually portable). The main flaw of this game, maybe the for most of the Tales of - games is the story and how it is told. Zestiria somehow has this problem. The characters are quite likable, but I can't help feeling that there should be more character development. And some EXPLICIT romance would be nice. But that's just me.\n\nI have to mention that the music in this game is superb. Especially on the Trial shrines and opening Japanese movie. There are numerous tracks, and battle musics somehow just pump up the already hectic battle system. Some would argue that it's all about button mashing, but without proper strategy and just pushing buttons haphazardly one would not get the best out of its intricate battles system. Oh, and be careful when fighting in tight spaces. The camera angle just goes bonkers in those cases.\n\nLastly, I cannot overlook how the game initially delivered. I'm talking about stuttering, choppy frame rate and audio problems. I have no problem with 30 fps, really, although I do prefer it to be in the sixties. It has all been fixed as of this review, but the bulk of the fix comes in the form of a third party patch. I REALLY think Bandai Namco can do better. I hope Berseria will not have these problems.\n\nAll in all, a good game, but I would say that it comes up short in some of the key aspects. I do recommend this for all Tales fans and Action JRPG fans. For newcomers to the series this would not be a bad start, but I do think they should start with the other games in the series.\n\nFinal score: 7.5/10","May 17","true","85.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you don't understand the storyline, you probably won't like this game at all. I feel like it's definately a game you would have to have the taste for to play. The battle controls are a little confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it they aren't so bad. I also like how there's always a challenge in every new area. They just help you to see how much you improve throughout the game. If you fight a challenge monster when you first enter an area (if you aren't over-leveled) it WILL kill you. Go back to that area later and the moster will still be there. The best part is, they don't attack you; you have to attack them first. Anyway, enough of that excited junk. If you feel like it sounds like your kind of game, give it a shot. The worst you can be is wrong.","April 18","true","77.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I play with a controller so i have no idea how the pc controls work but the controller settings are wonderful. (Though the battle camera gets stuck on walls sometimes) The decisions you make are actually quite interesting, SPOILERS: In the beginning of the game a merchant asks you if you want to sell a royal knife for 1000 gald, DO NOT SELL IT!!!! Trust me it saves you the hassle, with the knife you're able to bypass the guards blocking you're way into the church, AND the knife was used as a key to a dungeon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/howlingwind88/recommended/351970/","howlingwind88","Howling Wind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/howlingwind88/","112 products in account","So, Tales of Zestiria. First of all, I'll inform you that I'm a bit of a “Tales of” fan, but with them being scattered across various consoles, I've played only 3 of them before Zestiria: Symphonia, Abyss and Vesperia. Given the background, I'll make some comparisons, but I'll try to stick to the game to itself.\n\nI'll start right away with my overall impression, then if you'll like you can read the details behind my opinion. Tales of Zestiria it's an okay game: it's fun, it has interesting characters, the music is awesome, the battle system is quick paced. However, it's a bit of roller-coaster, with highs and lows, hits and misses; some aspects of the game are too simple, while other are too complicate. I'll stick on a 7,5/10 as a numeric value. If you're a “Tales of” fan, prepare for many changes; if you never played a “Tales of” game, this is a really nice JRPG, that needs some work on some things. In both cases, it will be a good experience!\n\nSo, why 7,5? Let's find out\n\nZestiria is a JRPG, so it's the usual mix of exploration, puzzles and battles, which are in real time: you command directly one of the characters in the party, while the others are guided by the CPU, that follows a series of guidelines customizable by the player. It's basically an action game, quick paced, fast, fun and enjoyable. However, you can still coordinate the attacks of the whole party, giving specific commands if you want to take on the battles with a more strategic approach.\n\nNow, the system has really changed from the previous “Tales of” games: you don't have a mana bar, but rather an action bar, that depletes when you attack or when you dodge, but it refills automatically if you defend or simply stand still. You don't have 'basic attacks' as in the other “Tales of” games, but rather different techniques (Artes) that you can use. Point is, the close combat Artes common to all the characters (the Martial Artes) are 'linear': you can do four attack in a combo before being forced to reset it, but the possibilities are very limited. At the first attack, you'll have to pick one of two specific Martial Artes, at the second one one of four specific Martial Artes and so on; at the second attack you can't pick a Martial Arte that triggers only at the fourth move. And it's a bit of a pain, since every enemy has weakness related to specific attacks. There are ways to break their resistance of course, you are playing with four characters after all so one of them will be able to strike hard the enemy when you can't. But aside from that, the combos you'll be able to create are impersonal and limited: back in Vesperia, it was GORGEUS to see the characters fighting... I made a 300+ hit combo in there! That was SO fun! Zestiria, however, becomes too repetitive too quickly. Of course, you have other types of melee attacks (the Occult Artes) and the classic long range magic attacks (the Seraphic Artes), so there are still possibilities, but still... This battle system feels like a bit of step backwards in order to make new things. They also added lots of battle rules and specific actions that are simply too many: it's nice to improve a fighting system by making it deeper, but I think they got too far. They also added a range of 50 skills bound to your equipments: from them, it comes most of the fighting power your characters will be able to acquire; you'll also be able to fuse equipments to either power up existing skills or making new ones. But even here, it's a bit too much: as I said, 50 skills. You really need a guide to understand how to get the desired result.\n\nIn short, they took many risks, some paid off, some didn't. It's still enjoyable, but it feels like they added too much to renovate the system.\n\nThe characters are enjoyable; we've seen better in the “Tales of” history, but we've seen worse. Overall, I liked them, some more than the others (Edna, Dezel, Zaveid), but I didn't actually dislike any of them. They're good, they work well. The plot is a bit traditional (chosen hero needs to defeat the big evil guy), but the characters interactions and developments make the story interesting and enjoyable. The game world feels a bit small, compared to other “Tales of”, and it needs more sidequests... But, credit where it's due, they gave you a hint system to tell you where you need to go to trigger the sidequest... In the past, you needed to be at the right place at the right time and they rarely gave you a hint about it.\n\nThe music is AWESOME, I really loved it, it pumps you up during the fights and it makes you feel the emotions of the characters.","December 5, 2015","true","121.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

During the first few hours of the game I was absolutely captivated. The world of Zestiria had the classic Tales flair with many Arthurian style elements, but that enthrallment slowly faded away due to the lack of character development and the story plot.\nGraphically the game is very beautiful despite being outdated PS3 graphics, and the world and character design are all magnificently executed. I really liked the characters in the beginning but as the game progressed I felt that the personalities they had become static. The story went from being interesting, to painfully predictable. The only thing that really kept me going was the battle system, which had some new wonderful implements, and my love of the Tales series.\nMy absolute biggest complaint was that I felt that the game was extremely linear due to the lack of side quests compared to that found in other Tales games. The side quests present in the game always felt like they were oddly timed between the few important story quests, and always revolved around optional dungeons. I did enjoy how optional dungeons were peppered into the newly improved world map system, but any quests that involved them were merely “go and fight X here.”\nDespite these complaints I would still recommend this game to any Tales fan. It won’t be your favorite Tales game ever, but it’s a solid entry in the series.\n","December 5, 2015","true","49.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Regarding the latter, I still dislike Mikleo's clothes and Soreys stupid ear feathers, but after our 70 hours together I love them far too much to care. I loved them enough after 2.\n\nHowever, The game does seem have Lower Production values than Xillia. The Field environments are far better spatially designs than the blobs of land seen in Xillia, but in parts are very, for want of a better word, polygony. The town and dungeon areas dont seem as well designed as Xillia but they arent quite so polygony. Possibly because most of the dungeons are ruins which could be made from repeatable rectilinear assets which would reduce the work needed.\n\nThe battle system is a bit of a departure from previous games. The battle system has been gradually become more are more 3 dimensional in each installment, and using the battle ability 'Free and Free' completly removes the 2d axis you traditionally fight on. I didnt. The ability to fuse with the different seraphim characters in your Party is good to really mix up the playstyle, whether it's for defensive reasons, in order the withstand a bosses blows, or just for when you get surrounded by enemies weak to water and want to maelstrom them into oblivion. The camera is not great. It is what it is.\n\nOne thing that has come under fire is the abilities on a grid system. It is quite complicated. There are 50 abilities which all occupy a grid. Line up 2 or more horizontally you will get different elemental bonuses, or of you get all 5 in a collumn vertically you get a stat boost. For example for the first collumn grants you 10% boost on all stats. However I was fearful of losing this bonus after I had gotten it and as as a result by characters were wearing 1st and 2nd tier equipment far too late in the game for them to be doing so. I later opted for equiping all the strongest equipments for their various strengths and making small consessions for certain abilities to make up for a characters weaknesses or provide abilities beneficial for certain bosses. For example I equipped Sorey with 3 peices of equipment with the Lindwer ability, providing 45% more damage against dragons (15 each), and the bonus for stacking 3 was adding an extra unit to my blast gauge (blast gauge being expended for fusing and special attacks).\n\nThe Strong point in this game in the characters. They are so likeable. I didnt think anyone would replace Jude Mathis of Tales of Xillia at the top of my list of most likeble Tales Protagonists but Sorey may have done just that. Theres lots of skits that expand on the characters, and even the enemy information is full little tidbits of Lailahs puns, Edna's snark and insults directed at Mikleo, and Sorey being so enamored with the little gun carts the goblins ride that he wished to be the first Goblin Shepherd (all the while being lightly chastised by Mikleo). Theres something quite refreshing about opening the enemy info mid boss and have rose making a Joke. Theres also a fair amount of fun in the item descriptions as well (Soreys not allowed to touch Mikleos hair, not since the incident) and its these little touches that really make Tales of Zestiria.\n\nTheres also a good soundtrack, a few pieces being outstanding, an overall improvement on previous games in the series.\n\nIf the question comes down to whether its better than Tales of Xillia then the answer is no, but that comparing an excellent JRPG with a very good one. If you have a PS3 play Xillia first. If you dont this is still worth your time and money.\n\nI only meant to write a short few words to show support. Whoops.\nAnd Meebo is my Precious Angel.","November 12, 2015","true","146.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love these games due to their active combat, good story, and not over-the-top art style. Many people want realistic games these days, but this series send it off to the side and give you +80 hours of gameplay with a good New Game+ system and replayability.\n\nNow lets break this game down. Tales of Zestiria is....not the best tales game.\n\nThe story follows Sorey, a boy/young man (age 17 but should be more like 14/15 I think) as he leaves his home and becomes the savior of the world. He grew up as the only human in a village of Seraphim, Magical human-like beings that cannot be seen by people who do not truely beleive in them, The world outside of his home is filled with "malevolence" and he must become the Shepard to harness the power of the Seraphim and defeat the Lord of Calamity...and monsters...and dragons.\n\nSo I am going to start with the bad things about this game:\n\n1. The world is very linear. I mean the map doesnt show it, but it is almost a straight line between towns and fields with dungeons to the side.\n\n2. Learning skills is again not great, you level up titles and get skills but not the same way like Graces F. The title helps you select which skill you get, but it is a small pool.\n\n3. Purchasing/customizing equipment is fairly staight forward but not great. Limited stocks, an annoying upgrade system, and how equipment bonuses combine is not explained well.\n\n4. Cut content is clear. Some parts of the map, like a field towards the end of the game shows a fortress wall that it looks like you need to pass though and explore the world more, like another nation. Nope, this was cut from the game. It might have fixed some of the linearness but it was deemed unnecessary. You can find small bits here and there around the game.\n\n5. Characters are not great. Example: Sorey, even though he is 17, seems to lack any libido or desire beyond friendship. Now, I am sure this is somewhat understandible but there is almost no, if any, relationships in the game. For a "story rich" game, I am sorry, but there should be some kind of relationship between ANYONE beyond friends.\n\n6. The story. Well the story is okay at best. Unlike other Tales games, this is extremely straight forward. Xillia you couldn't hate your enemy and even respected all of them for their reasons, Symphonia was also complex, Graces was again another complex story where you end up respecting or atleast accepting your enemy. Here in Zestiria though, you are pushed to feel bad for your enemy but....I just can't do it.\n\nNow the saving graces of the game:\n\n1. The active combat of the game like other Tales games, weaknesses, resistances, and your need to guard/quickstep.\n\n2. Replayability\n\n3. Each equipment has it uniqueness with skills to it\n\n4.The Armitization in the game, where you merge with a seraphim and change your combat style.\n\n5. you can make weaker enemies more powerful by equiping "normin" which give you an augment party wide (like 4% def) and boosts enemy levels. up to 3 types of boosts and +30 levels to enemies. Makes weaker areas decent to farm in - if that is what you like.\n\n\nAll in all: It is not a bad game, it is a good game and fun. Gameplay is great though the plot could be better. Cut material from the game really makes is sad how much is lacking from what could have been. Battles are fun to play and can be avoided if you want (for the most part) as it is not random encounters. Not a game I will sit for hours on end playing, but I will play a couple here and there with breaks in between.","November 11, 2015","true","71.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I felt as though my library was in need of more JRPG's and I made a bold choice purchasing ToZ without any idea of what the game was about or any insight of what to expect it was a pure jump in the deep end which luckily paid off.\nI won't lie, the game is not perfect, I felt the story wasn't as rich as it could have been but the gameplay was flawless, the character interaction as good and I really enjoyed the battle system even though at first it felt a bit overwhelming you quickly pick things up as you go along.\n\nStory\nThe story is about a teenage human boy named Sorey who has lived amongst seraphim (beings with power unseen by natural humans) since he was a baby, events transpire that takes him on a quest in search for an unknown force that is causing great malevolence (a darkness that is created by the evil within humans and seraphim), taking on the role as the Shepard (ancient heroes that can take on the power of seraphim and purify the world of malevolence) he crosses the world with his companions bringing peace and light to all.\n\nI felt the story as a whole was written well, it was straight forward and left no questions unanswered.\n7/10\n\nCharacters\nWithout giving too much away of possible playable characters I won't name them all but in total you get a party of 6 players which of only 3 or 4 may battle.\n\nCharacter development is my biggest problem regarding to the characters, I just didn't really feel emotionally attached to any of them as much as I should do when playing an JRPG (That FF7 moment with Aeris still haunts me to this day), not to say the characters are boring or flat in fact the characters Edna and Zaveid will probably go down as some of my favourite, again that is all I can say about that without ruining a part of the game.\n\nThe quirky interactions they have during battle or when resting in inns is brilliant and does bring some light hearted comedy into the equation which makes sleeping at the inn worthwhile!\nI enjoyed the characters and found some parts amusing however I do feel as though the characters could have been developed a bit better to give the players more of an emotional attachment.\n6/10\n\nGameplay\nThe game handles well, probably what you'd expect from a JRPG, open world exploration countless battles, be prepared for ultimate grinding I was taken into a false sense of security in thinking levelling up was easy until I hit break point and spent ages farming exp (and gald, plenty of gald).\n\nThe weapon system is easy enough to understand and with fusion if you start to horde weapon equipment (as long as they are the same item) you can fuse them together (for a price of course) making the weapons stronger and transferring any abilities they may have.\n\nThe use of Artes is easy, again once you get the knack it's a case of carefully coordinating your attacks leading to some killer combos!\n\nOne thing which is also helpful are across the world are these things called stone monolith's which when interacted with just give basic tips on the game itself, if like me and you're not a fan of this then you really don't need to read them but you do collect AP points which become helpful as you use these to spend on battle actions.\n\nBattle Actions are a series of automated instructions you can give to the main protagonist Sorey, things like Auto backstep which (obviously) automatically backstep evades attacks at the cost of some SP points, which I think stands for Stamina points?\n\nThe battle camera is probably THE worse aspect of the game, it can become annoying when pinned into a corner and the camera zooms right into the battle and then to make matters worse a tree branch gets into your line of sight, it's very frustrating and has killed me a few times, I'd like to say you get used to it but you don't you just learn not to get pinned into a corner. Even when it's not zooming in its spinning out of control, it sometimes feels someone is recording the battle on a mobile phone or video camera and can't keep still, I'd like to point out it's not always like that though, but when it does you will rage.\n\nThe gameplay is great and my favourite thing about the game but it loses points on the battle camera part which is a shame.\n9/10\n\n\nI feel as though I've covered most things vital, Tales of Zestiria is a must have for any JRPG lover, I've played under 64 hours completed it and now I've started my second play through on Chaos mode (they have a New Game+ feature).\n\n\nOverall score\n7.5/10","November 14, 2015","true","63.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

If you've never played a Tales game before and are an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to pickup one of the best RPG series you've probably never heard of. The Tales Of games are a series similar to Final Fantasy but have never reached the same level of acclaim due to many of the games not being localized in English or only being released for specific consoles. Despite that, the Tales Of series has been going strong since the SNES days and is one of the greatest RPG series of all time. Combine the action-oriented combat with deep character customization, great narrative and plot, and for the first time ever, branching storylines with choices that impact the game as you play along.\n\nIf you are a Tales fan, you are about to experience one of the best games in the series. I have not beaten the game, and as I said am only 3 hours in, but I will update this review as I progress. But I can already tell this is THE defining game in the series. Want the best of Tales of Graces without the quirky combat, the cool and memorable deep characters from Xillia, the unique story of Phantasia, the epic feeling of Symphonia, and the awesome graphics of Vespiria all in one game? That's what I'm getting from Tales of Zesteria, and at only 3 hours in. There is so much depth to the battle mechanics, titles, equipment, collectibles, skits and more.\n\nYou need to play this game. Technical issues will be ironed out, this is the first PC Tales game... EVER. So they are surely developing on a new platform they haven't worked with before. Please support the game and encourage this great series to cater to PC gamers in the future.","October 20, 2015","true","41.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When you switch the game to surround sound it's actually creating seperate channels for each audio type and a lot of people are saying they lose the voice sounds.  I plugged in my Logitech Z506 5.1 Surrond Speaker system to my computer it had been sitting stagnant for awhile as soon as i plugged it in and turned them on my voice sounds were coming crystal clear through the center channel with no problems what so ever.  If you're using one of those gaming headset that says Dolby 7.1 surround they only actually have 2 speakers with drivers making them sound like 7.1 so you're not going to get all the sound channels in them stick to stereo for the game.\n\nTo get back on topic.

Regarding the latter, I still dislike Mikleo's clothes and Soreys stupid ear feathers, but after our 70 hours together I love them far too much to care. I loved them enough after 2.\n\nHowever, The game does seem have Lower Production values than Xillia. The Field environments are far better spatially designs than the blobs of land seen in Xillia, but in parts are very, for want of a better word, polygony. The town and dungeon areas dont seem as well designed as Xillia but they arent quite so polygony. Possibly because most of the dungeons are ruins which could be made from repeatable rectilinear assets which would reduce the work needed.\n\nThe battle system is a bit of a departure from previous games. The battle system has been gradually become more are more 3 dimensional in each installment, and using the battle ability 'Free and Free' completly removes the 2d axis you traditionally fight on. I didnt. The ability to fuse with the different seraphim characters in your Party is good to really mix up the playstyle, whether it's for defensive reasons, in order the withstand a bosses blows, or just for when you get surrounded by enemies weak to water and want to maelstrom them into oblivion. The camera is not great. It is what it is.\n\nOne thing that has come under fire is the abilities on a grid system. It is quite complicated. There are 50 abilities which all occupy a grid. Line up 2 or more horizontally you will get different elemental bonuses, or of you get all 5 in a collumn vertically you get a stat boost. For example for the first collumn grants you 10% boost on all stats. However I was fearful of losing this bonus after I had gotten it and as as a result by characters were wearing 1st and 2nd tier equipment far too late in the game for them to be doing so. I later opted for equiping all the strongest equipments for their various strengths and making small consessions for certain abilities to make up for a characters weaknesses or provide abilities beneficial for certain bosses. For example I equipped Sorey with 3 peices of equipment with the Lindwer ability, providing 45% more damage against dragons (15 each), and the bonus for stacking 3 was adding an extra unit to my blast gauge (blast gauge being expended for fusing and special attacks).\n\nThe Strong point in this game in the characters. They are so likeable. I didnt think anyone would replace Jude Mathis of Tales of Xillia at the top of my list of most likeble Tales Protagonists but Sorey may have done just that. Theres lots of skits that expand on the characters, and even the enemy information is full little tidbits of Lailahs puns, Edna's snark and insults directed at Mikleo, and Sorey being so enamored with the little gun carts the goblins ride that he wished to be the first Goblin Shepherd (all the while being lightly chastised by Mikleo). Theres something quite refreshing about opening the enemy info mid boss and have rose making a Joke. Theres also a fair amount of fun in the item descriptions as well (Soreys not allowed to touch Mikleos hair, not since the incident) and its these little touches that really make Tales of Zestiria.\n\nTheres also a good soundtrack, a few pieces being outstanding, an overall improvement on previous games in the series.\n\nIf the question comes down to whether its better than Tales of Xillia then the answer is no, but that comparing an excellent JRPG with a very good one. If you have a PS3 play Xillia first. If you dont this is still worth your time and money.\n\nI only meant to write a short few words to show support. Whoops.\nAnd Meebo is my Precious Angel.","November 12, 2015","true","146.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love these games due to their active combat, good story, and not over-the-top art style. Many people want realistic games these days, but this series send it off to the side and give you +80 hours of gameplay with a good New Game+ system and replayability.\n\nNow lets break this game down. Tales of Zestiria is....not the best tales game.\n\nThe story follows Sorey, a boy/young man (age 17 but should be more like 14/15 I think) as he leaves his home and becomes the savior of the world. He grew up as the only human in a village of Seraphim, Magical human-like beings that cannot be seen by people who do not truely beleive in them, The world outside of his home is filled with "malevolence" and he must become the Shepard to harness the power of the Seraphim and defeat the Lord of Calamity...and monsters...and dragons.\n\nSo I am going to start with the bad things about this game:\n\n1. The world is very linear. I mean the map doesnt show it, but it is almost a straight line between towns and fields with dungeons to the side.\n\n2. Learning skills is again not great, you level up titles and get skills but not the same way like Graces F. The title helps you select which skill you get, but it is a small pool.\n\n3. Purchasing/customizing equipment is fairly staight forward but not great. Limited stocks, an annoying upgrade system, and how equipment bonuses combine is not explained well.\n\n4. Cut content is clear. Some parts of the map, like a field towards the end of the game shows a fortress wall that it looks like you need to pass though and explore the world more, like another nation. Nope, this was cut from the game. It might have fixed some of the linearness but it was deemed unnecessary. You can find small bits here and there around the game.\n\n5. Characters are not great. Example: Sorey, even though he is 17, seems to lack any libido or desire beyond friendship. Now, I am sure this is somewhat understandible but there is almost no, if any, relationships in the game. For a "story rich" game, I am sorry, but there should be some kind of relationship between ANYONE beyond friends.\n\n6. The story. Well the story is okay at best. Unlike other Tales games, this is extremely straight forward. Xillia you couldn't hate your enemy and even respected all of them for their reasons, Symphonia was also complex, Graces was again another complex story where you end up respecting or atleast accepting your enemy. Here in Zestiria though, you are pushed to feel bad for your enemy but....I just can't do it.\n\nNow the saving graces of the game:\n\n1. The active combat of the game like other Tales games, weaknesses, resistances, and your need to guard/quickstep.\n\n2. Replayability\n\n3. Each equipment has it uniqueness with skills to it\n\n4.The Armitization in the game, where you merge with a seraphim and change your combat style.\n\n5. you can make weaker enemies more powerful by equiping "normin" which give you an augment party wide (like 4% def) and boosts enemy levels. up to 3 types of boosts and +30 levels to enemies. Makes weaker areas decent to farm in - if that is what you like.\n\n\nAll in all: It is not a bad game, it is a good game and fun. Gameplay is great though the plot could be better. Cut material from the game really makes is sad how much is lacking from what could have been. Battles are fun to play and can be avoided if you want (for the most part) as it is not random encounters. Not a game I will sit for hours on end playing, but I will play a couple here and there with breaks in between.","November 11, 2015","true","71.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The gameplay mechanics have evolved with the "Armatization" system and the RPG elements this game have to offer are widly dependent on your equipment and the way you choose to upgrade them. I think these were both great changes made to the game!\n\nOn the downside though...the story is very plain and the characters are very forgettable. I was very dissapointed with this aspect of the game and hope that future installments will improve upon this.\n\nOverall: 7/10","December 4, 2015","true","49.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First of all, I'll inform you that I'm a bit of a “Tales of” fan, but with them being scattered across various consoles, I've played only 3 of them before Zestiria: Symphonia, Abyss and Vesperia. Given the background, I'll make some comparisons, but I'll try to stick to the game to itself.\n\nI'll start right away with my overall impression, then if you'll like you can read the details behind my opinion. Tales of Zestiria it's an okay game: it's fun, it has interesting characters, the music is awesome, the battle system is quick paced. However, it's a bit of roller-coaster, with highs and lows, hits and misses; some aspects of the game are too simple, while other are too complicate. I'll stick on a 7,5/10 as a numeric value. If you're a “Tales of” fan, prepare for many changes; if you never played a “Tales of” game, this is a really nice JRPG, that needs some work on some things. In both cases, it will be a good experience!\n\nSo, why 7,5? Let's find out\n\nZestiria is a JRPG, so it's the usual mix of exploration, puzzles and battles, which are in real time: you command directly one of the characters in the party, while the others are guided by the CPU, that follows a series of guidelines customizable by the player. It's basically an action game, quick paced, fast, fun and enjoyable. However, you can still coordinate the attacks of the whole party, giving specific commands if you want to take on the battles with a more strategic approach.\n\nNow, the system has really changed from the previous “Tales of” games: you don't have a mana bar, but rather an action bar, that depletes when you attack or when you dodge, but it refills automatically if you defend or simply stand still. You don't have 'basic attacks' as in the other “Tales of” games, but rather different techniques (Artes) that you can use. Point is, the close combat Artes common to all the characters (the Martial Artes) are 'linear': you can do four attack in a combo before being forced to reset it, but the possibilities are very limited. At the first attack, you'll have to pick one of two specific Martial Artes, at the second one one of four specific Martial Artes and so on; at the second attack you can't pick a Martial Arte that triggers only at the fourth move. And it's a bit of a pain, since every enemy has weakness related to specific attacks. There are ways to break their resistance of course, you are playing with four characters after all so one of them will be able to strike hard the enemy when you can't. But aside from that, the combos you'll be able to create are impersonal and limited: back in Vesperia, it was GORGEUS to see the characters fighting... I made a 300+ hit combo in there! That was SO fun! Zestiria, however, becomes too repetitive too quickly. Of course, you have other types of melee attacks (the Occult Artes) and the classic long range magic attacks (the Seraphic Artes), so there are still possibilities, but still... This battle system feels like a bit of step backwards in order to make new things. They also added lots of battle rules and specific actions that are simply too many: it's nice to improve a fighting system by making it deeper, but I think they got too far. They also added a range of 50 skills bound to your equipments: from them, it comes most of the fighting power your characters will be able to acquire; you'll also be able to fuse equipments to either power up existing skills or making new ones. But even here, it's a bit too much: as I said, 50 skills. You really need a guide to understand how to get the desired result.\n\nIn short, they took many risks, some paid off, some didn't. It's still enjoyable, but it feels like they added too much to renovate the system.\n\nThe characters are enjoyable; we've seen better in the “Tales of” history, but we've seen worse. Overall, I liked them, some more than the others (Edna, Dezel, Zaveid), but I didn't actually dislike any of them. They're good, they work well. The plot is a bit traditional (chosen hero needs to defeat the big evil guy), but the characters interactions and developments make the story interesting and enjoyable. The game world feels a bit small, compared to other “Tales of”, and it needs more sidequests... But, credit where it's due, they gave you a hint system to tell you where you need to go to trigger the sidequest... In the past, you needed to be at the right place at the right time and they rarely gave you a hint about it.\n\nThe music is AWESOME, I really loved it, it pumps you up during the fights and it makes you feel the emotions of the characters.","December 5, 2015","true","121.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

During the first few hours of the game I was absolutely captivated. The world of Zestiria had the classic Tales flair with many Arthurian style elements, but that enthrallment slowly faded away due to the lack of character development and the story plot.\nGraphically the game is very beautiful despite being outdated PS3 graphics, and the world and character design are all magnificently executed. I really liked the characters in the beginning but as the game progressed I felt that the personalities they had become static. The story went from being interesting, to painfully predictable. The only thing that really kept me going was the battle system, which had some new wonderful implements, and my love of the Tales series.\nMy absolute biggest complaint was that I felt that the game was extremely linear due to the lack of side quests compared to that found in other Tales games. The side quests present in the game always felt like they were oddly timed between the few important story quests, and always revolved around optional dungeons. I did enjoy how optional dungeons were peppered into the newly improved world map system, but any quests that involved them were merely “go and fight X here.”\nDespite these complaints I would still recommend this game to any Tales fan. It won’t be your favorite Tales game ever, but it’s a solid entry in the series.\n","December 5, 2015","true","49.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I felt as though my library was in need of more JRPG's and I made a bold choice purchasing ToZ without any idea of what the game was about or any insight of what to expect it was a pure jump in the deep end which luckily paid off.\nI won't lie, the game is not perfect, I felt the story wasn't as rich as it could have been but the gameplay was flawless, the character interaction as good and I really enjoyed the battle system even though at first it felt a bit overwhelming you quickly pick things up as you go along.\n\nStory\nThe story is about a teenage human boy named Sorey who has lived amongst seraphim (beings with power unseen by natural humans) since he was a baby, events transpire that takes him on a quest in search for an unknown force that is causing great malevolence (a darkness that is created by the evil within humans and seraphim), taking on the role as the Shepard (ancient heroes that can take on the power of seraphim and purify the world of malevolence) he crosses the world with his companions bringing peace and light to all.\n\nI felt the story as a whole was written well, it was straight forward and left no questions unanswered.\n7/10\n\nCharacters\nWithout giving too much away of possible playable characters I won't name them all but in total you get a party of 6 players which of only 3 or 4 may battle.\n\nCharacter development is my biggest problem regarding to the characters, I just didn't really feel emotionally attached to any of them as much as I should do when playing an JRPG (That FF7 moment with Aeris still haunts me to this day), not to say the characters are boring or flat in fact the characters Edna and Zaveid will probably go down as some of my favourite, again that is all I can say about that without ruining a part of the game.\n\nThe quirky interactions they have during battle or when resting in inns is brilliant and does bring some light hearted comedy into the equation which makes sleeping at the inn worthwhile!\nI enjoyed the characters and found some parts amusing however I do feel as though the characters could have been developed a bit better to give the players more of an emotional attachment.\n6/10\n\nGameplay\nThe game handles well, probably what you'd expect from a JRPG, open world exploration countless battles, be prepared for ultimate grinding I was taken into a false sense of security in thinking levelling up was easy until I hit break point and spent ages farming exp (and gald, plenty of gald).\n\nThe weapon system is easy enough to understand and with fusion if you start to horde weapon equipment (as long as they are the same item) you can fuse them together (for a price of course) making the weapons stronger and transferring any abilities they may have.\n\nThe use of Artes is easy, again once you get the knack it's a case of carefully coordinating your attacks leading to some killer combos!\n\nOne thing which is also helpful are across the world are these things called stone monolith's which when interacted with just give basic tips on the game itself, if like me and you're not a fan of this then you really don't need to read them but you do collect AP points which become helpful as you use these to spend on battle actions.\n\nBattle Actions are a series of automated instructions you can give to the main protagonist Sorey, things like Auto backstep which (obviously) automatically backstep evades attacks at the cost of some SP points, which I think stands for Stamina points?\n\nThe battle camera is probably THE worse aspect of the game, it can become annoying when pinned into a corner and the camera zooms right into the battle and then to make matters worse a tree branch gets into your line of sight, it's very frustrating and has killed me a few times, I'd like to say you get used to it but you don't you just learn not to get pinned into a corner. Even when it's not zooming in its spinning out of control, it sometimes feels someone is recording the battle on a mobile phone or video camera and can't keep still, I'd like to point out it's not always like that though, but when it does you will rage.\n\nThe gameplay is great and my favourite thing about the game but it loses points on the battle camera part which is a shame.\n9/10\n\n\nI feel as though I've covered most things vital, Tales of Zestiria is a must have for any JRPG lover, I've played under 64 hours completed it and now I've started my second play through on Chaos mode (they have a New Game+ feature).\n\n\nOverall score\n7.5/10","November 14, 2015","true","63.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

No one I truly hated, except maybe Alisha because she's kinda cliche,whiny, pink color-coded and easily manipulated, but she redeemed herself, kind of. I also liked how she was treated as another hero, instead of just a supporting heroine, albeit much of her story dlc revolves around Sorey. Lailah's voice kinda annoys me but it grows on me. EDNA&ROSE BEST GIRL COMBO, srsly I usually hate hitting on female characters because I'd rather hit that abs instead but gimme rose and I'll be hey baby wanna go get some cake. Edna is so much like me I'm really grateful for my friend's patience hahahah Mikleo is my son and Sorey's his boyfriend the cinnamon bun too pure for this world. Their relationship and Bamco's devotion to subtle details confirming it deserves an essay but I'm busy coz finals so considers yourself lucky :9\n- Ending, because my son gets a happy ever after with his dearest ;----; plus he looks so pretty with his fluffy ponytail. I don't wanna spoil anything, but I think he's the one who suffers most, so I'm really happy he got his well-deserved happy ever after\n- Extensive battle systems, but if you're lazy you can also leave it up to the character\n- BGM. Personal favorite is the water temple theme, nyan cat song, Zaveid's theme and Journey's End\n\nNeutral: - story, albeit its pretty cliche, it still have twist so its not really deus ex machina perfect ending\n- Costume DLC, because I can only gaze at them when they're in battles or FEELS scenes :( at least let mikleo be the one to follow me so I can gaze on him in swimsuits :< but the design is so adorable 10/10 would cosplay so I give it neutral.mthe school ones with glasses hnngh\n\nBad: - Camera, but still tolerable\n- I don't know if it's just me,but I kept getting lost because the character just said "we need to go to town C" but HOW DO I GET THERE THROUGH WHEREEEE but I'm pretty blind with directions, both irl and in games, so perhaps it's just me\n- The 15/items cap :( perhaps I'm just too used to x99 cap in most rpgs..... But the 15 items caps sucks especially when I'm in a dungeon for grinding and there's no turtlez nor a save point in sight\n- Easily missable skits, especially ones with vital character developments and very specific unlocking requirements\n\n\n- kinda unrelated but THE MIKLEO FIGURE IS KINDA BAD IM CRYING ;____; srsly bamco you could have my money but now you don't. Mikleo is the most popular character so how could u do dissssss think of the lost money.His hair should be half-transparent, his pose is awkward, the colouring feels dull..... I wish there's a mikleo nendo or another figure, this time a better one plz. GIMME A DOLLFIE VER (to dress up) AND ILL THROW MY MONEY\n\nNot recommended for those MAH WAIFU TYPE, go back to To Love Ru or Nisekoi if you want those kind of stuff\nRecommended for Tales fans, RPG fans, fujoshi (hay thar my brethren feel free to talk to me if u have any doubt regarding TOZ), those who loves to customise their battle\nThose who don't really like gays (well I'm also not a yuri fan but I like madoka), don't worry because this is like madoka; the romance is not really in-your-face, but there are enough hints so I can say with conviction that yes, mikleo is the heroine, sorey and mikleo is the most canon relationship (another one is perhaps Dezel x Rose, but they're can also be interpreted  as father-daughter), but it's subtle enough so people who don't like it can still enjoy the game. Well, Tales series never have super in-your-face romance anyway\n\nP.S: if you're a crybaby prepare tissues I cried at least 6 times yes i counted","December 4, 2015","true","21.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

The combat elements are fairly simple yet enjoyable. The only downside to Zestiria is the fact that the story is incredibly mediocre. After 30+ hours of gameplay I can hardly stand to finish the game even though I am close to the end. If you require an enjoyable story to muddle your way through a game then I do not recommend this game. However, if all you want is button mashing combat with a few Artes thrown in to take advantage of a weakness then you should enjoy this one.","January 8","false","31.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I was accidentally running it on my Intel i5 processor instead of my Nvidia and it STILL ran great on around medium graphics!\n\nBut aside from that, Tales of Zestiria is really shaping up to be a top-notch JRPG and a good entry into the Tales series. The environments are beautiful, the story so far is pretty intriguing, and the characters are diverse! The battle system is your typical Tales Of fare, with the Armatization mechanic to mix it up. Yes, the camera is problematic, but it's an easily avoided one in most cases.\n\nI've listened to some of the soundtrack before release, and the Zestiria soundtrack is probably one of my top soundtracks to date. Each song has richness and depth that you rarely see with atmosphere soundtracks these days, and the special tracks by Go Shiina are just incredible.\n\nI'll update this review as I play, but I don't forsee my current strong recommendation changing throughout!","October 19, 2015","true","96.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

They're literally everywhere and according to the game they even eat food, yet somehow most people don't acknowledge or believe in them despite what I assume has to be a extremely high number of floating and disappearing food reports. The whole thing is a completely unnecessay plot device in my opinion.\n\nThe other part of the lore is that whenever a human, seraphim and even animals gets mad or hateful enough they become powerful monsters, who then apparently live forever unless the chosen one kills them, which turns them back, unless they're still angry or get angry again in which case they'll apparenly turn back into a monster. So instead of being a badass warrior of justice the game makes you feel more like an anger management counselor.\n\nPLOT\nEverything is pointless. There's several times where you will get to choose one of two seemingly important options in dialogue, but you get the same result no matter what you pick. The only difference is that you occasionally get a slightly different cutscene on some of them. And speaking of dialogue, the word "malevolence" literally shows up in almost every sentence from every character.\n\nAnother example is a character doing something in a cutscene just to show how cool you're supposed to think they are, such as one character trying to fight an enemy on their own because they're immune to it's special ability, only for you to have to fight the boss with the rest of the party like normal anyway with absolutely no changes to the fighting mechanics. So the entire cutscene was basically just that one character saying "Look how cool I am.".\n\nThere's also several times in the story where the party does something completely pointless and unsatisfying, such as confronting a major and extremely dangerous villain who intends to kill a lot of people, and then letting them calmly walk away as if they were just players on different football teams or something. Literally every time that there's a confrontation, the solution that's forced onto you is to go somewhere and do something to get stronger first regardless of what might happen in the meantime.\n\nDespite the MC supposedly being the "chosen one", there's multiple other people that can do everything he does, only with less whining. Also, near the start of the game he pulls a legendary sword from a stone (super original) to become the chosen one, though immediately after the sword isn't shown anywhere and is inexplicably never mentioned again. Yet another completely unnecessay plot device.\n\nCHARACTERS\nCompletely uninteresting and generic anime archtypal characters. There's no character developement or flaws to speak of, the MC is your standard naive good guy type who generally has about as much to add to the situation as a Buzz Lightyear pull string doll. And the bad guys are equally one dimensional, they're all just flatly evil and want to do evil things because they're evil for no reason other than because they're evil. And just in case them being evil is too much for you to keep track of they all have dark colors, clothes, and auras to make things simple for you.\n\nGRAPHICS\nStandard anime style characters and medieval fantasy style world, the lack of imagination isn't that big of a deal on it's own, however the graphics are late Xbox or early 360 quality at best. Before I played this I recently played Tales of the Abyss on PS2 and the change is pretty minimal, which is inexcusable considering they're a decade apart. Aside from the quality the lack of originality and overuse of immersion breaking anime cutscenes make looking at the screen more of a chore than it needs to be. The game sports a little bit of character customization, though extremely limited, however they're all shown as their default setups in any of the numerous anime cutscenes. So it's pretty bad for the immersion.\n\nCOMBAT\nThe combat is bad, it's extremely awkward, boring, and one-sided. There is zero strategy involved, you can't assign any roles to your party members such as healing or tanking, and they have no problem repeatedly walking into a lingering attack that is killing them. You'd think that would make it more of a hack and slash style game, however any time you get a few good hits in on an enemy they inexplicably become invincible for a random amount of time. Which is especially annoying when you finally get one of the super moves to work, only to have it completely wasted on a basic monster who decided to turn on god mode. The whole thing could be compared to playing rock, paper, scissors but everytime you throw the right one your opponent ignores it and says that they win anyway.\n\nSo combat generally consists of you running around in circles, hitting an enemy a few times, and then running away while your party members get murdered and then automatically revived via the ridiculous super saiyan mechanic.\nAside from all that, the camera is really bad, it's more focused on following the enemy than your character and there's no way to not be locked onto something. Actions such as dodging will leave your camera where it was, leaving your character to end up off-screen while the invincible enemies curb stomp your super saiyan brains in.","May 17","false","40.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vosse/recommended/351970/","Vosse","BONKERS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vosse/","428 products in account","Tales of Zestiria is a decent port marred by frame limiting issues that they refuse to fix\nI will admit, I came into this with low expectations after they announced it'd be 30FPS only.\nInitially I was impressed with this port as it does a lot of things right that others fail to do. But it has a lot of issues that they just are completely ignoring. They are willing to fix some issues carrying things to the side DLC, but dont' give a ♥♥♥♥ about anything else. At least not yet, and not that they have communicated. Which is irritating as all hell. It doesn't inspire faith for Symphonia on PC.\n\nThe only reason this is getting a "Yes" and upvote is because of TZFix picking up the slack and fixing a lot of problems.\n\nLook at the Alisha DLC issues, they swooped in and fixed those STAT. The rest of the problems? AT LEAST the damn frame rate limiter causing constant stuttering? NOPE. That's a non-problem.\n\n\n\n\nPros Arbitrary Resolution Support\nDecent amount of Graphics Options (Including Texture Filtering,even if it is completely useless on some textures.)\nDX9 meaning we can force better Anti Aliasing! I made a guide here ! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539008816 (Might still be waiting to be approved)\nRetains Local-CoOp\nLocal-CoOp supports two controllers or KB&M+Controller\nButtons are fully remappable\nSeparate Sound Sliders\nWell optimized (I can run 5464x3072 on a 980 and only be hitting just over half GPU usage)\nKB*M and Controller prompts (Though it does not auto detect between the two. You have to set it in the main menu first)\nSurround Sound\nEnglish and Japanese voice overs______________________________________________________________________\n\nCons  Does not natively support any resolution other than 16:9.\nFixed with TZFix\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/351970/discussions/0/490123938441506815\n\nVsync is partially broken. It will only apply when you turn it on in the Main Menu and then quit the game using the "Quit" Button. And then restart the game. (If you Alt-F4 it will not work)\nForcing Vsync is not an option, at least in my testing. Any forced Vsync from the Drivers (including 1/2 refresh Vsync on 60hz which is 30hz sync) will result in constant microstuttering and judder every so many rendered frames.\nAnd as it turns out, the in game Vsync has Microstuttering as well!\nTZFix can fix this in a few different ways.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/351970/discussions/0/490123938441506815\n\nThere are currently issues with different Sound Sample Rates than 48.0Khz or even 44.1khz, from crashing to crackling audio. You will need to set your output device's SR in shared mode to at least 44.1khz.  A fix is included in this larger utility/fix https://steamcommunity.com/app/351970/discussions/0/490123938441506815/\n\nIt uses Bink video for the Anime FMVs *Uck* it's 2015 people get a damn clue and quit using this low quality crap. The PS3 version used BDMV for Blu-Ray quality video, IIRC it was like an additional 16GB just for video. Which is nice.\nFinal Fantasy Type-0 uses x264 videos. Something MORE games should start doing if you are going to include FMVs.\n\n\n30FPS cap. This is not a port of an old game, something that can be excused for games like Grandia 2 or Type-0. Not for a new game. Though Honestly i'd be just fine if they fixed the damn stuttering and reduced latency more.\nTZFix has 60FPS WIP, it's not perfect mind you. We'll see how it turns out.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/351970/discussions/0/490123938441506815\n\nThe configured analog stick dead-zones are kind of on the poor side. Using a wierd OEM 360 controller here.\nNo Playstation Icons for DualShock4 users\n\nInput latency feels a bit on the sluggish side. You can improve this a little by forcing 1 Maximum Pre-rendered frames in the driver.\n\nOriginally included the Japanese OP song with vocals by mistake. They rushed to patch this literally day 1. So I don't think you can get it now unless someone is redistributing that file. (Which may be illegal as silly as it is. The Japanese are weird when it comes to licensing man) But seem to be taking their time with other things that are painfully obvious to everyone that should've been patched already. (Vsync for example)\n\nAs an optimization left over from the PS3 version, distant animated characters/models have their framerate reduced to 20 or 15FPS (I can't remember). The same happens when there are a large amount of characters on screen at once in battle IIRC. This looks really jarring and I don't see why it wasn't removed. As this is an optimization thing where they just reduce the Refresh beyond a certain threshold. I don't see why they can't just add that as an option in the menu to disable it completely.\n\nSome Z-Precision issues. If you see bits of textures or geometry sort of flickering back and forth between two totally different textures. It's Z-Fighting.  It doesn't even have to be very far away. Character's Hair or Eyes at a short distance can have Z-Fighting\n\nThere is secondary bloom PP that is run at a fixed scale of 512x256 or so that looks beyond ugly at high resolutions. On character models it's like a secondary drop shadow that flickers and crawls constantly. On the envronment this causes flickering.\nTZFix's PP Ratio can fix it. https://steamcommunity.com/app/351970/discussions/0/490123938441506815\n\nThe Shadows setting only affects Environmental Shadows. They are 2048x2048 at max and highest LOD. But you wouldn't be able to tell that by looking because the LOD and Draw distances are super short. And the filtering is some of the worst i've seen in a modern title. The filtering solution is extremely poor. Adding to the joy of this is that Character Shadows have really good filtering. But they are insanely low resolution. Sorey gets like 128x128 and everyone else gets 64x64 IIRC.\nTZFix can increase character shadow and environment shadow resolution, but it can't fix the filtering of environment shadows, or the distances.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/351970/discussions/0/490123938441506815\n\nSome textures (especially distant grass textures) seem to either have no MIP MAPs or are forced on with point filtering no matter what. This looks beyond awful, those areas just become a noisy mess of flickering 100% sharp pixels. TZFix's option to force load all MIPs doesn't solve this.\nAnd not even brute force 16xSSAA can fix the flickering completely. (Though some SSAA+SGSSAA can).\n\nThe easiest way to see it is in the intro of the game at the top of the Ruins.\nThere are some bugs with Alisha's DLC. They have acknowledged these but have ignored all others.\nThe LOD setting seems to do absolutely nothing that anyone can see.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's Tales man. I don't think i've ever NOT enjoyed a Tales game. At least not a Mothership title. Not even the original Destiny or Phantasia, which are almost a bit painfully sluggish to play these days. Even if they have issues or a rough spot, they are always worth playing for console RPG fans.\n\nI tend to mainly comment about technical things when it comes to ports, rather than the games themselves. As I find this is a more important matter. It is 2015, and there are basic standards that need to be met.","October 21, 2015","true","25.4"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eighttailedfox/recommended/351970/","eighttailedfox","Shadow Esper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eighttailedfox/","273 products in account","Long review, so skip to the bottom, for the TL:DR\n\n\n\nFirst off the PC port of this is amazing, while yes it only runs at 30 fps, it has all the other settings required of a PC port.\n\nNow, for a year I completely remained ignorant to any of the story from the japanese release, as such, going in, I knew nothing, except for the alisha scandal. I can safely say, that Zesteria is a good game. Not a great game, not a bad one.\n\nThe Xillia games were a mess of incoherent ideas with no clear focus. Decent characters, but the motivations, story turns, and overall plot were far underwhelming and dissappointing for long time Tales of players, like me. But it had wonderful set pieces.\n\nZesteria on the other hand, is much the same. Except with a lack of memorable set pieces. So why do I consider it better? Zesteria is a sort of first for the Tales of series, an experiment to see if certain things work, and while some do, others don't.\n\nIn order to get the full experience out of the battle system, you are forced to play one of two characters, the rest of the playable cast will be used merely for buffs. So unlike previous titles, you can't really specialize with one character that aren't the two humans. Not to mention the party formation is NEVER saved. So you cosntantly have to switch to your prefered parties after every cutscene.\n\nThe characters, while enjoyable, are lacking in growth. It feels like the game is only 2/3rds of what it should be. The villains and heroes don't get the development needed to have a concrete emotional connection on why they do what they do.\n\nIt took me 29 hours to beat the main campaign, the first time. A decent length, but many of those hours were hollow, running around, trying to find where to go next. Searching every crevice just trying to know where to do. And there's two of these sections in the story. They give you a goal, you can do them in any order, go do it.\n\nVesperia is my favourite in the series, followed by Graces F and Symphonia. And I am one of the few that enjoyed Symphonia 2. All four of these games set up their characters and play out their stories in a natural and understanding way.\n\nEven Xillia 1 did this, and for the most part it worked, until they introduced a character that made no sense within the context of the world. Xillia 2, well, It had a character so good, so well thought out, that it was amazing. Then they throguh it away.\n\nZesteria is lacking as a Tales of Game. Just as the Xillias were. And the only reason I consider it worse then Xillia 1, is because Xillia 2 is technically the second half of that story. Xillia 1 is better then Zesteria, but only because the plot is a tiny bit more coherent then this one.\n\nThe base characters, are good. They interact with each other well, and their skits and dialogue are spot on, but the lack of growth and compentant story, feels like they're jsut going through the motions.\n\nAnd that's what this comes down it. Zesteria is bandai namco, going through the motions. It's a technical marvel at the technology for creating a battlefield from the terrain, but that's where it seems most of their efforts were laid.\n\nThere is a god awful lack of extra content. There is no hot springs side quest, no cooking challenge.\n\nAnd what I cannot forgive, is that some side quests are locked off if you proceed with the story too much. Making them increable hard to complete without prior knowledge of when they're safe to complete.\n\nNow. I've complained for a few paragraphs of why this game is lackluster, but it despite all this, Zesteria is a good game. My eyes as a Tales of fan, may be blind to the needs of a new player, and it's a solid game. I whole heartedly recommend it.\n\nBut there are better Tales of Games. Symphonia comes out next year, and it's a much better, more solid experience of a game.\n\n\n\nTL:DR\n\nA technical marvel as an experiment on Tales of technology. The story and charcters are lacking in  meaningful development, with a plot that contradicts itself.\n\nThe combat is fun, and later on deep with layers.\n\nRecommended for the combat, but not the story.\n\n\nEdit: With a few months of reflection on my feelings for this game, I don't recommend it. Not going to do into detail about it.","October 22, 2015","false","38.9"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","16","31","2","0"

Characters development was ok, although I think they could have expended more like the other Tales game do. The plot is straight forward. Chosen inocent boy grows strong to save the world... No plot twist no nothing. You meet the main antagonist early on and you try to get stronger to defeat him. The main story isnt that bad but it falls a little flat.There are a lot of side quests and are fun but the loot isnt that mehh.\n\nLeveling up is kind of weird. It is either grind millions of boring minions or fight mini-bosses who can 1hit or combo you down instantly (Although most of them have obvious attack animation). Equipments menu is weird and have confusing bonuses but you dont need to figure it out how it works. I beat the game with picking random equipments.\n\nVoice dubs is great and it has an option of japanese voice which duhh is always great. Dialogs are well written with a lot of jokes between the characters. Graphics are good and the game barely has any lag. Dont let the 30fps scare you.\n\nI still have the ex- dungeon and the Alishia dlc to finish","October 19, 2015","true","53.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Final Fantasy VII has nothing to do with Final Fantasy XIII but XIII-2 is related to XIII) so you can easily get into this game without playing previous entries. The "Tales of" series isn't well known for their stories in fact I find them all to be pretty weak but one of the strong points is the characters in each story and how they interact with on another, what they do on their adventure, and their overall chemistry is entertaining. The anime cliches can be a turn off for some and unbearable for others but if you can look past that the "Tales of" series offers fun gameplay and is the major reason I became a fan. All the games aren't your traditional turn based rpg game but rather real time "fighter" in which you control a character and attack doing normal attacks and specials to create combos.\nThis time around in Tales of Zestiria you find yourself fighting on a 3d plane similar to recent entries in the series however to cut down on load times instead of encountering a monster and getting put onto a battle area you instead fight on the overworld map itself fighting from wide open planes to narrow corridors with obstacles here and there every now and then. Overall I think Tales of Zestiria is an ok entry into the series and is a nice little title to get a taste of what "Tales of" has to offer but there are older titles I would highly recommend in its place.\n\nFor "Tales of" fans:\nIts not PS3 Vesperia or DC Destiny","October 19, 2015","true","77.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If you're a fan of the tales series it seems to be more of the same.  I expect the same tropes and new twists on some things.\n\nThe skits are a return to Tales of Graces with full character models instead of the usual boxed heads.  The combat is focused more on the main protganist with the other characters able to enhance him better (without spoiling too much of the plot).  It is an interesting mechanic.  Xillia 2 locked Luger in place for the entire game (allowing you to play anyone but he had to stay in the party of four).  In Zestiria while you can control any character you choose (just like most other tales series) it's in your best interest to stick with the main protagnist as you add more members to your crew.  Additionally you have to have a human in control and there are other limiting factors to potential party make-up.  I'm taking a "wait-and-see" on how much this ends up bothering me.\n\nI haven't had any issues with the PC port and have been using my PS3 controller with no issues.  I also switched to the keyboard/mouse controls for a little bit and those worked fine as well.  English voice acting is also well done.\n\nThe equipment/crafting portion of the game seems to be a bit more convoluted then it needs to be, but I think as time wanes on I'll figure out my way around it.  Also the addition of being able to slot things into the zone (eventually this happens to avoid spoilers) that level up the monsters might give the player control to keep any zone relevant to your level.\n\nI will say that the motley crew didn't start to round out really well (even skit wise) until Edna came along for me.  So if you're finding the crew to be a bit dull or not your cup of tea... tough it out until her.\n\nI look forward to losing more time to this game!","October 19, 2015","true","90.5"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

So far seems decent, better than most of the ports of recent times.\n\nThat said there are some issues I find annoying, some will be fixed, some won't.\n\nThankfully keyboard/mouse work, and they actually play overall smoothly and well. Although I have a controller, I am thinking of not bothering with this title, as I do like the feel of K/M in it. That said there are some issues.\n\nMost problematic is that instead of actually taking a good look at the UI and figuring out a decent control scheme, they just went for the brute force approach. Notably it does have reasonable mouse driven functions. However when using the keyboard every option is mapped to varying keys, in no logical way. Plenty of options could have been reduced to a single common set of keys, but aren't. In this sense keyboard layout for game menus is horrendous. It does thankfully display the keys to use at all times, but it is still annoying given it uses the full spread of the keyboard, when it is not a keyboard only game.\n\nApart from that I would recommend to save often. There are currently some game breaking bugs with no way out, so if you get trapped in one without a recent save, arrrrrrrrggggghhh... One I just experienced was where on opening the merchant sell screen some key bindings failed. So that although I could sell stuff, I couldn't exit the screen and get back to the game. Who would have known a merchant was the final invulnerable boss.\n\nOn the graphics side I have had no particular problems apart from reasonably bad screen-tearing which is fixable.

Runs great on my shitbox laptop. Visuals are crisp, Japanese voice acting is solid, and although I am only 4-5 hours in, the stage is set and the story is beginning to build nicely.\n\nAdd to that a battle and ability system that has the potential for a large ammount of versatility and, thus far, this becomes a game that would belong in any collection, and an absolute staple of a JRPG one.\n\n9/10 so far, with a point docked for some truly ridiculous skits in the DLC.

Setting Vsynch in Nvidia/Amd control panels works perfectly. Xbox One controller works without issues. I did start it up and then quit and restart just to ensure it would run fine.\n\nThere is plenty of difficulty settings (Tried Moderate but it was a bit tough and went back to Normal) and alot of other nice options like subtitles on/off, long or normal time-windows for performing combos, satisfactory Graphics options and more.\n\nIt runs at a constant 30 FPS without stuttering or framerate-drops I've found and the steam overlay works fine with it.

It's got a good range of resolution options, even going up to 1440p for my monitor. Preset graphics selections, FXAA support, draw distance, and a few other things to modify for graphics on top of that. It runs smoothly without any signs of stutters or crashing.\n\nThe biggest caveat for some would be the ugly textures in places and 30 FPS lock. However, I'm able to forgive them as it's a port of a PS3 game.  Allowing higher than 30 FPS would have broken the combat system, according to the developers.\n\nStill, hopefully with this game successful, they'll see PC as not a place to port, but as a primary release for future Tales games. And maybe those games will be designed around 60 FPS from the get go.\n\nFor the game itself, I can't judge. Only 30 minutes in. But so far, it seems to bring the standard Tales flavour, with its own unique charm.  If you love Tales games, you'll love this game.\n\nEDIT: After 3 hours of playing today, I've experienced a few graphical issues. Screen tearing and flickering happens extremely rarely, but it's noticeable when it does. However, this happaned maybe once an hour.\n\nThe battle camera can also be an issue: But only in the specific instance of battle starting while you're in a cramped area (like a doorway).\n\nStill, these two problems are not nearly enough for me to not recommend it. In those 3 hours, most of my experience was good. The battle system is deep, and a good flow of tutorials and new mechanics means that it won't get stale for awhile - even once they stop I'll still have a lot to learn.","October 19, 2015","true","35.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It is the first game that I actually decided to take a risk and preorder it. I was not disappointed. Unlike some of the people here I didn't have any issues with the game and it runs really smooth(I have really bad PC for 2015). The game itself is story driven and even  tho I didn't get far into the game story managed to suck me in already. Every now and then you will encounter an cinematic. Cinematics are like a short anime. They are really detailed and well done and they greatily contribute to story telling. Combat is okay, it is action based and  you can choose if you want it to be automatic, semi-auto or manual so it woud appeal to more people I guess. Characters have regular attacks and this so called "Artes" which can be chained together in a combo. With equipment you get more combos and different attacks.\n\nKeep in mind that this is my first game in franchise so I don't know how better/worse it is from its predecessors. I will probably update this review once I finish the game but until then I highly recommend the game.","October 20, 2015","true","31.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This series of games always has that unique feel that is truly immersive with their storyline, characters, environment, battle style and music that all comes together to make one great game. Tales of Zestiria so far has still met these standards after all this time.\n\nGranted I haven't played much of the game yet, but so far I can tell its going to be incredible. Very few bugs at launch, all fixable (which I did not encounter any so far), and overall a great port as far as I can see. The game runs amazing, and the story looks like its going to be a great one. I'll definitely be playing this game until the end. Whether you are a fan of the Tales series, or looking to jump into this JRPG for the first time, you're going to love it.","October 19, 2015","true","38.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I loved the old Tales francise and this game doesn't disapoint the kid inside me... movement around the map is smooth controls handle properly( Xbox controller). Voice overs are excellently done, kinda cheesy but welcomed. I am sure this is a ps3 port and I saw this on steam and could care less I was more excited the tales games are coming to PC.\n\nIf you like JRPG's  and looking for a game to sink 30+ hours into this would be the way to go. My only problem is the battle system starting off it's just mashing the B button and hope for the best... The old style tales games had more flow to them... I am only a couple hours in and I haven't done much yet so I can't comment on the FULL combat system.\n\nOverall 8\10 so far.","October 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldreactive/recommended/351970/","coldreactive","coldReactive (Iyeru)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldreactive/","313 products in account","Dear Bandai Namco Entertainment of Americaz,\n\nThis iz my sincere review of Talez of Zestiria for both PlayStation 4 and the Personal Computer. The first thing I would like to congratulate the developer teamz on, iz being able to deliverz a solid PC port of a Talez game. It haz great controlz, and graphical settingz (though it would've been nice if it had Fullscreen Borderless.) However, there are some thingz I would like to point outz that have given me some annoyance or troublez. The first of which being that the game has no minigamez, at allz. When I camez to Katz Korner, I was expecting at least one minigame or something, but I waz saddened to find nothingz. Gone are the dayz of being able to play Talez of DB on Talez of the Abyss, and limited to only listening to an epic cat songz, re-watching Skitz, Re-watching anime cutscenz and beating up a Toitlez for the good of making a point. This isn't the only issue I have thoughz, I'd like to point out that the game'z new equipment direction iz a bit strange, giving only HP on orbz obtainment, or via Sage, is a bit annoying, and making levelz practically meaningless iz even more so for casual playerz of the franchize.\n\nFurthermorez, the game'z story is a bit lack-lusterz in comparison to prior talez gamez, and seemz to be slightly rushed. The game also copiez a lot of the story designz from a game known as Legend of Legaia, and I'll admit, I preferred that game more than this one. Even after all that, I did get a healthyz 45+ Hourz out of it on PS4 before pushing the game to itz limitz by forcing everyone'z statz to maximum on PC, this caused the game to be shortened to about 20 hourz or less, far less if you just skipz all the cutscenez. While I admitz, Talez of the Abyss is the longest Talez game title in the seriez, it would be nice if we got something on that scale again in the futurez. I really liked how Talez of the Abyss was able to make uz think there waz a final boss coming upz, but then it waz like "Nopez, we liedz, this iz only aboutz 1/3 the gamez." I hopez you will readz these wordz with utmost seriousness. While It lookz likez this iz a silly response, this iz a serious review of the gamez.\n\nSincerelyz,\nIan Carlsonz\nMadisonz Wizconsinz, USA\n\nP.S: Toitlez, Katz and Cowz for life. Alsoz, do considerz a more darkz talez in the futurez, one wherez the worldz is destroyedz like Final Fantasyz Six (Threez in Japanz.) Or Likez Wildz ARMz.\n\nOh alsoz, I only reccommendz this game if youz want to supportz the developmentz of more Talez gamez for PC. Otherwisez, get it on PlayStation 4.","November 1, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I've played a lot of tales games and this game plays a bit differently. The combat and battle encounters feel nice and a bit more simplified than other tales combat systems, which isn't to say it's bad. The combat encounters have no load times, attacks are done in a flow chart for comboing and there are different elements. Your stats and passive abilities come from your equiptment which you can combine to make better equiptment etc. Your artes are unlocked from your titles and leveling up. Dungeons can get boring. The story is what kept me playing, I really enjoyed it. On the surface it seems like a happy and fun game but then the story's tone dramatically changes dark unexpectedly/randomly, which I didn't mind too much. The tone varies a lot at times. It didn't exactly feel too forced and they were able to tie in the dramatic dark tone changes in the story. The unexpected reveals are what kept me thinking about the game long after I beat it, especially the entire ending/aftercredits. Even the little things in the game's story like the subtle characters interactions with one another kept me thinking about it. I figured the english voice actors would be mediocre  and sound annoying so I switched to japanese. The game was overall a lot of fun and the characters were great. I feel like a few things might have been/were lost in translation but I'm okay with that because I enjoyed the game and got what I wanted out of it. 8/10","December 27, 2015","true","53.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Characters development was ok, although I think they could have expended more like the other Tales game do. The plot is straight forward. Chosen inocent boy grows strong to save the world... No plot twist no nothing. You meet the main antagonist early on and you try to get stronger to defeat him. The main story isnt that bad but it falls a little flat.There are a lot of side quests and are fun but the loot isnt that mehh.\n\nLeveling up is kind of weird. It is either grind millions of boring minions or fight mini-bosses who can 1hit or combo you down instantly (Although most of them have obvious attack animation). Equipments menu is weird and have confusing bonuses but you dont need to figure it out how it works. I beat the game with picking random equipments.\n\nVoice dubs is great and it has an option of japanese voice which duhh is always great. Dialogs are well written with a lot of jokes between the characters. Graphics are good and the game barely has any lag. Dont let the 30fps scare you.\n\nI still have the ex- dungeon and the Alishia dlc to finish","October 19, 2015","true","53.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I've played a lot of tales games and this game plays a bit differently. The combat and battle encounters feel nice and a bit more simplified than other tales combat systems, which isn't to say it's bad. The combat encounters have no load times, attacks are done in a flow chart for comboing and there are different elements. Your stats and passive abilities come from your equiptment which you can combine to make better equiptment etc. Your artes are unlocked from your titles and leveling up. Dungeons can get boring. The story is what kept me playing, I really enjoyed it. On the surface it seems like a happy and fun game but then the story's tone dramatically changes dark unexpectedly/randomly, which I didn't mind too much. The tone varies a lot at times. It didn't exactly feel too forced and they were able to tie in the dramatic dark tone changes in the story. The unexpected reveals are what kept me thinking about the game long after I beat it, especially the entire ending/aftercredits. Even the little things in the game's story like the subtle characters interactions with one another kept me thinking about it. I figured the english voice actors would be mediocre  and sound annoying so I switched to japanese. The game was overall a lot of fun and the characters were great. I feel like a few things might have been/were lost in translation but I'm okay with that because I enjoyed the game and got what I wanted out of it. 8/10","December 27, 2015","true","53.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm from Europe (United Kingdom), so I got the game yesterday. Here is my review SO FAR of what I have experienced.\n\nSIDE NOTE: I thought the game was called "Zest-ria" rather than "Zest-iria" until I loaded up the title screen. Pleb of the year = ...me.\nThe game itself is unbelievable. I definitely recommend it to everyone who likes any sort of JRPG, and to new players of this diverse genre. The Open World aesthetics are fantastic, however the graphics are amazing in my opinion although some people say they're a little outdated, but thats no reason to miss this game at all really.\n\nThe main reason to buy this game should be the Gameplay, Storyline and the Characters with excellent development and I just have to say ultimately that Tales of Zestiria presents them all throroughly.\n\nAside from a few of the DLC packs (e.g. Adventure Items) which have partly no use in the game, because it only REALLY takes a little bit of grinding to achieve the same outcome xD, I am very satisfied with the outcome of this beautiful game.\n\n10/10, thanks for reading! :)\n\nALSO: If you're going to buy the game, I'd reccomend following   this   Discussion post to acquire some free Storyline DLC for a limited time only!

This is my first tittle in the series so I do not carry the fan-bias of the series. In clarity the last time I enjoyed a JRPG this much was when I played Legend of the Dragoon back on PS1 funny cause in both the  wind element dude dies. =)\n\n\nThe story was a lot of fun and the NPC's have a lot of character and interaction with one another and there are a few plot twists which help keep you pumped for what is coming up next. I even really enjoyed some of the commedy after each fight as your comrads talk to eachother.\n\nUnlike Most JRPG the game features an action oriented combat system, it starts off very slow in the begining of the game however it builds up in complexity quickly after you begin to pick up skills and battle techniques. To the extent where you may spend some time trying to figure out the deep mechanics in this game as they start to get thrown at you very quickly at an overwealming rate especially if you are new to the series.\n\nThere are a few porting technical issues the game has common issue with Bandai however a great modding community has a easy to install fix that makes it run well.\n\nThis is one of the few JRPG I have ever put this much time into and would recommend anyone interested in a fun story, challenging combat system and enjoys high replayability to try out.","May 16","true","80.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

We quit pretty friggin soon, because the first 4 battles made it clear, the camera will center on your enemy target and swivel so you can't see yourself or your enemy. Fighting with your camera stick is as unintuitive as it could possibly be, because I literally cannot make it include both of our characters at the same time. Really hard to enjoy an action rpg when you cannot view your character during the fight, let alone figure out how to walk into where the camera is looking.\n\nI very well might continue the game one day, but honestly I don't have a work-around for such a basic function in a game, and it made it so innane, I just can't imagine forcing myself to deal with it.","May 22","false","0.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The story is what you expect in a typical series, but there\'s numerous problems with the game and you\'d think that a company that has been making these types of RPGs for nearly 20 years would be learning from their mistakes. First and foremost are the controls. They haven\'t been adopted to fit the 3D style. Holding down now often means holding back, and your character runs backwards when you try to use down + attack or down + arte. Another problem with the game is that you only have 2 human characters to use at a time. One human character can only be partnered up with one of the Seraphs, spirit like beings that only some people can see. The result is that even though you have four characters in your party, you can only use two. I also hope you don't get too attached to the heroine of the game because she gets replaced halfway through.\n\nA serious issue I had with the game is the fact that Lailah is somehow bound to not speak about the past. The emphasis of learning your own answer through a journey is important, but the fact that she withholds crucial information throughout the game makes me feel like everyone is an idiot.\n\nAnother problem with the game is that the enemies have huge amounts of super armor and invincibility frames. Super armor is when the enemy breaks your combo and become immune to stun and knockbacks for a period of time. Invincibility is when they are immune to all damage while they are performing their attack. This occurs far too frequently in the game and many enemies activate it after a fixed number of hits, automatically ending your combo, even if they are airborne at the moment. Ironically, many of your character\'s powered up transformations hit very rapidly and very quickly, allowing you to make high hit combos. The problem is that this automatically triggers the enemy\'s auto response that makes them invincibile, largely making this feature useless.\n\nThere are some massive changes in this game compared to the other ones. Levels mean nothing in this game as it only gives you additional HP and the ability to equip more Skills (you can get more of those points from finding stupid monuments in the game than leveling up though). Stats are acquired from new equipment and killing bosses, not from leveling up. They also changed Grades and Skills to be unlocked by acquiring achievements. There are hints as to what you need to do to unlock them, but it quickly becomes something tedious. For the first time there is also no dedicated healer. Instead, everyone has a bunch of small heals, nothing that is meant for the entire party. Compared to the previous installments of Tales of Xillia and Tales of Xillia 2, this game has a worse story and worse gameplay.\n\nThe only good thing about buying this game was that I received Tales of Symphonia for free because I pre-ordered a terrible game. Hopefully Tales of Bestiria will improve on the combat and the story.","May 31","false","25.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The combat system is awful from a Tales standpoint.\n\nComing from other Tales games, I recall the combat being fluid, and all about stringing together long combos. It was simplistic, but exciting. While playing Vesperia, I found myself performing long 100+ hit combos from somewhere near the midpoint in the game, and capping the whole thing off with a Mystic Art. The battle system was simple enough to pick up and learn that you could start exploring the kinds of Arte combos available to you quickly.\n\nZestiria's combat is anything but simple. Attacks have been split into three categories. Martial Artes (your basic attacks), Hidden Artes (Your Sonic Thrusts and your Demon Fangs), and Seraphic Artes (Spells.) These have been given a rock, paper, scissors style interaction. Martial Artes interrupt spells, Spells cast faster when struck by Hidden Artes, and Hidden Artes cannot be interrupted by Martial Artes. This isn't so bad, except for one glaring fact. This interaction is rarely relevant.\n\nThere are five elements in the game. Physical, Fire, Wind, Water, and Earth. The vast majority of enemies are resistant to most of these. If it's resistant, it takes very little damage and doesn't stagger regardless of what Arte you use. To make this worse, most of your attacks are now imbued with elements from the start, so you have to pick your combos based on what will deal damage, rather than what you think will be fun.\n\nThis cuts out some of the freedom to build your own fighting style that was present in past Tales games. But this is just the beginning of Tales of "No Fun Allowed."\n\nYou can only have 4 party members at a time. Two of them are permanently set. Sorey, and his human partner. Despite being perfectly capable of doing things normally, your other 4 party members require a 1/1 human/seraph ratio to participate in fights. So gone is the ability to choose 2 half of your party based on personal preference and combat style.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The four other party members each correspond with one of the four non-physical elements! I remind you, most enemies resist all but one or two elements, so you'll be forced to pick and choose which of those members to include in the party based of their element. Again, removing yet another element of choice from you.\n\nSo the game already goes out of its way to force your hand in choosing specific parties of characters throughout the game, but what else is wrong with the battle system? Surely it's still a classic example of Tales gameplay, right? Nope.\n\nEnjoy your Over The Shoulder camera angle and full 3D combat arenas. In older Tales games, battles were mostly fought on a linear plane. You frequently had the option to move yourself around the battlefield, but the actual combat tended to take place in a straight line. Left to right. With the changes, I find a lot of my attacks just straight up missing. Sword cuts flying off into the ether and accomplishing nothing.\n\nAnd I've saved the worst for last: The SC system.\n\nIn previous Tales games, mashing the attack button was a free action. It cost nothing. In Zestiria, that attack costs SC. SC replaces mana in this game, but where your mana pool could be increased in past games, your SC bar is permanently set at 100. And some of your Artes cost 25+ SC to use. You see where I'm going with this?\n\nOne SC intensive combo can drain your bar entirely. Hell, there are some combos you can't even perform because it will empty your bar before it's finished. So how do you refill your bar?\n\nYou WAIT.\n\nSC refills very quickly, but the short 2 seconds where you're told "stop" by the game, over and over again, is infuriating. Past Tales games, you had to manage your mana if you wanted to perform a long combo using your Artes, but this was only an issue if the fight dragged on. SC becomes a constant problem every few seconds during fights with boss enemies.\n\nYou can refill SC alternatively by blocking or dodging attacks, but both of these abilities are slow to respond,\n\nIn addition, even if you're managing your SC well, enemies tend to obtain Super Armor after you've combo'd them once or twice, thus making them immune to a second combo even if they're in the middle of an Arte yours SHOULD in theory interrupt.\n\nThe game is, in essence, slapping you on the wrist for trying to play it in any way it doesn't deem acceptable. Compared to the freedom of previous Tales games, I personally found this awful. I never discovered a way to circumvent these problems in my 60 hours of total playtime, and  as a result, the game was a slog. At every turn it felt like the game was actively preventing me from enjoying myself.\n\nTL;DR:\nThe Bad\nBland dungeon design\nWeak plot\nTerrible combat system\n\nThe Good\nSome of the music is fantastic\nZestiria has better characters than Abyss\n\n4/10\nComing from past Tales games, this was a major letdown. It's not unplayable, but I wish I'd just replayed Vesperia.","November 14, 2015","false","62.1"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","21","43","0","2"

Even without unfair comparison, Zestiria is not a great game. Thankfully the port runs smoothly and looks great (a promising sign for the future) but almost every facet of the game is disappointing.\n\nGoing for the low hanging fruit, the plot and characters are hideous anime cliches through and through. The protagonist is wide-eyed and bushy-tailed but naive and idealistic, one of the female protagonist is kind of the same but calm and royalty while the other one is kind of wild and energetic. All the seraphs are just different shades of anime: mother figure, cynical one, older realistic brother figure, dark mysterious dude. Really tiring and boring garbage.\n\nCombat is frankly a pain in the ♥♥♥. Without barfing a dissertation onto you, there are three different types of attacks that break each other in a rock-scissor-paper fashion which is often obnoxious to put to any use. Combat often felt like a cluster♥♥♥♥ of getting the right combo off at the right time and praying the enemy didn't start channelling an attack that opposed yours. Bosses require that you armatise with their elemental weakness in mind otherwise you will straight up get stomped every time.\n\nEquipment sucks as well. No learning neat abilities or artes, they just have various stat boosts and other assorted passives. You can only fuse the same pieces of equipment to produce higher leveled versions of that (e.g. vest + vest = vest +2!) and the boosts, of which there can only be a max of four, interact to make new stat boosts. This interaction further depends on whether the equipment is mastered or not either. Mastering equipment does nothing outside of fusion. It's pretty tedious and extremely bad.\n\nSo yeah, there is little to really like about Tales of Zestiria. I very stupidly tried to push myself through this game and at 35 hours I realised I still couldn't see the end in sight and was completely sick of every single aspect.\n\nTL;DR? This isn't Tales of Vesperia.","January 4","false","38.3"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","6"

The story is your "standard" JRPG fair, with some unique twists and some design element changes, although much of the content can be seen to be borrowed from predessors here or there. The game looks graphically stunning given the choice of cell shaded sprites and environments, not on par with other notable modern JRPGs, but will likely stand the test of time quite well. Its battle system is contrived however you can simplify it down to the point of a few button mashing combos and occasional artes change, although in truth there is great depth to the combat system and you could spend a fair amount of time invested in it as well as the equipment/progression. Overall the game is good, definitely worth a play for JRPG enthusiasts looking for something new, although it likely won't be an iconic classic like others in the Tales, or in other series. Full recommend regardless, if you like JRPGs, look no further....if you don't like JRPGs...you are looking in the wrong place.","October 19, 2015","true","106.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

What a day to be alive.\n\nAs a longtime Tales fan, I'm glad to see Tales of Zestiria on this platform. It has many features that fans of the series like me can appreciate, such as dual audio support (Japanese voices!), and full controller support (how would playing this on keyboard and mouse even work?). Don't forget steam trading cards, who can forget those valuable gems?\n\nThere are some potential drawbacks though. The dreaded 30fps cap exists here, and I can safely say it has had no negative impact on my experience so far. Could my computer run a PS3 port at 60fps? Probably. Will someone remove that cap eventually? Most likely. Is it a big deal? Not at all. This game also has no online co-op or anything. I personally figured that was given and didn't expect it, but I saw a negative review mention it so I figured I'd throw it in here.\n\nThe game itself plays like any tales fan would expect it to, combat is action based and you bump into (or smack) enemies on the overworld to start battles. A new feature is that the battles actually take place on the overworld, which means no loading times and immediate action. That's pretty swell. Skits make their return, and goofy character interaction between the more serious plot elements is abundant.\n\nTales of Zestiria has met all of my expectations so far, and I look forward to delving deeper into it. I hope any tales fan reading this does too! This game looks to be a good entry point for anyone wanting to try out the series as well, so give it a shot everyone and anyone!","October 19, 2015","true","29.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I can't believe it! I played another 2 hours or so (with breaks to play Cities skyline and Battlefield Hardline on my Xbox) and it's working perfectly fine with a few ploblems in game. Other than that, I'm loving it!\n\nThe character developments (Sorey's development especially), The fighting scenes especially that Fox guy, the scenery, EVERYTHING! The opening in the eng version was great too (Pumped up!!). There are plenty of things to do (I haven't reach that part yet) Which doesn't make you feel bored\n\nHowever, there are some downsides with the game at the moment as many of you know.\nI've noticed in some scenes that whenever a character speaks, they take a little longer to speak like in other games i play. This also goes for movement as well. It's just.....weird. It just feels....sluggish and they may need to improve on that\nThe camera. Yep. I have to complain about this. Especially in battle. Switching camera types doesn't help at all (I use Xbox one Controller but the game reads it as Xbox 360).\nI just can't trust the quick save at all. Sometimes it works somethings it doesn't.\nIt can get boring really quickly if you are someone like me who prefers exciting things. (I get bored real easily. Just look at my list.\nFPS locked at 30fps isn't my problem.

But this time it's on PC! Who would of guessed we would see the day?\n\nIt's not a perfect port but by no means is it a bad one. Just make sure you go to your Nvidia control panel and turn on Vsync (or however you do it with AMD) because the in game option doesn't seem to do anything. Also unfortunantly the game is capped at 30fps, I'm assuming it's mostly because the game was about 95% developped as a PS3 exclusive before they randomly decided to put it on PS4 and PC (not that I'm complaining), so most of the mechanics and animation are designed around a 30fps lock so unless they pretty much rebuild the game from the ground up any higher that 30 will just break the game. Good job Jap devs..\n\nBut if you can look past that and you love to play as a hero that has a sword and powers and stuff and has a very JRPG/Anime way of doing things you'll probably enjoy the game. Also Troppy Animoo stuff.\n\n\n[EDIT] Also it's the first time I booted a game up and it's like: Wow senpai, your PC is pretty good why are you only playing in 1080p?

My favorites include Symphonia, The Abyss, and I enjoyed Vesperia for the most part.\n\nKey aspects of enjoyable "Tales of" gameplay include immersive environments and narrative, unique and tasteful dungeons, and rewarding combat. I will discuss each of these in comparison to past Tales games in order to evaluate Zestiria.\n\nTales of Zestiria has already shown me that the dungeons and environments are both an eyesore and mindless. Even the massive towns and cities don't have the graceful and fantastic architecture and layout we've come to love. The heights of Baticul in The Abyss come to mind. Zestiria features Ladylake, the spiritual successor to Baticul, and besides sharing a similar sillhouette, Ladylake comes off as an empty shell of a town. The wide expanses of town are over-textured in order to hide bland and recycled geometry. All pathways are marked by walls and posts. Nothing but knee high walls to dictate where you walk and what qualifies as "town". The shops and inns dont even have signage or unique features. They are just a door you are allowed to go through amidst dozens of fake doors. In comparison, Tales of the Abyss featured obviously marked inns and shops. Looking at my minimap for a tiny icon indicating the door is an inn breaks immersion hard.\n\nI am just reaching the first moment in the first dungeon, and I cannot recommend this one. At this point in the story in Symphonia, we were in the holy tower which featured unique architecture and a two-level block puzzle. The puzzles were unique, and we even got to fight big stone golems, the first large/tough enemies that weren't bosses. In contrast, Zestiria has me walking through greebled hallways with no unique architectural features fighting nothing but bats and slimes. Rectangle hallways into square rooms into more hallways. I have not encountered a single puzzle.\n\nIn terms of story, Zestiria was promising to me in that it directly draws from Arthurian Legend. I am a big fan of the legends of king arthur and his holy knights. You are a king-arthur like character with a galahad agenda, and it seems the world is based on medieval times. I was even intrigued by the inclusion of story-changing choices. For example, I had the opportunity to give away a personal prized posession, or the prized posession of a friend in order to get into a forbidden area. I really weighed my morals before choosing, but in less than an hour the item I gave away came back to me. It was senseless. Why did I care at all?\n\nThe combat is Zestiria's only saving grace. It is tactile, wieldly, and pretty. It's complexity must really shine in the late game, but I won't find out because I don't want to play the game anymore. What do I care about quality combat if the world and story I do it in are bland and poorly designed? As much as I want to give Zestiria a second chance, I cannot stomach the obviously uninspired world anymore.","May 5","false","5.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I'm already enjoying it a lot more than I did the Xillia series.\n\nThe graphics are BEAUTIFUL! The English voice acting is amazing and so far I haven't run into any major problems with the PC port. I did have voice problems, but simply setting the sound option back to Stereo from Surround sound fixed that.\n\nThe only complaint I have with the game at this point is that it seems to like to hog my computer's RAM and it has gotten so slow a couple of times that I just had to restart the entire game. Other than that it feels amazing to play on the PC rather than the Playstation.\n\nLooking forward to the rest of the game! :)","October 20, 2015","true","52.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So far only put about 5 hours into the game. It plays very smooth and has been a great game.  Only thing outside of the screen tearing that I have had has been a bug during combat were I have gotten stuf not doing damage nor recieving damage from enemies, but it isn't really a bug so much as user error on my part for not realizing I am stuck in certain tutorials long after being well into the game.\n\nThe game is huge, 5 hours in and I am still getting tutorials and still often haven't a clue what I am doing and I love that about the game.  I can see that 50 hours into the game I will still be learning and most likely 100 hours into it I will just be getting the hang of the gameplay.  This isn't a 10 hour game and that makes me very happy.\n\nThe plot is normal for a JRPG.  But the Anime cut-scenes are great and the over all quality is awesome.   I am super digging the game.

Frankly I don't care and its been stated enough at this point.\n\nif this is your first tales game please don't even think for a moment that the story is going to be good. In fact they introduce possibly the most important mechanic in the game in a mundane battle with no build up and try to make it out as an emotional battle scene- and fail miserably.\n\nThis isn't to say the story is complete rubbish- its a JRPG for heavens sake it can use almost as many cliches as it wants, though i must say they didn't resort to 'chosen one' here, rather 'one who chose' if that makes any sense.\n\nThe battle- Its a tales game! of course its good!\n\nthe controls- By far the weakest point of the game is using a generic controller. if you have a PC compatible xbox controller it will make your life a whole lot easier. if not, your going to have to set up each individual button to make sure you don't get lost.\n\nanother thing about generic controllers and this game is that some buttons think they are the same, thus meaning you have one less button.\n\nDespite all this you will eventually configure everything to your liking and figure out how character changing works (You need to go into the in battle item/arts menu and press the button you assigned. Don't see why to bother outside of battle.)\n\nOverall i'd say its not got the best story, even for a tales game, but the things that make tales games good- their selling points: Skits and awesome combat are still strong... If you can get the skits button to work.\n\nIf you don't have an Xbox controller I'd say use the keyboard, in fact the keyboard might even be BETTER.","October 20, 2015","true","30.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I like that the game doesnt use TP, and really love that there is Japanese/English options for VA. (I prefer Japanese).

So far only put about 5 hours into the game. It plays very smooth and has been a great game.  Only thing outside of the screen tearing that I have had has been a bug during combat were I have gotten stuf not doing damage nor recieving damage from enemies, but it isn't really a bug so much as user error on my part for not realizing I am stuck in certain tutorials long after being well into the game.\n\nThe game is huge, 5 hours in and I am still getting tutorials and still often haven't a clue what I am doing and I love that about the game.  I can see that 50 hours into the game I will still be learning and most likely 100 hours into it I will just be getting the hang of the gameplay.  This isn't a 10 hour game and that makes me very happy.\n\nThe plot is normal for a JRPG.  But the Anime cut-scenes are great and the over all quality is awesome.   I am super digging the game.

First and foremost before you read this reveiw I am going to openly admit that I have never played a Tales game before and that this was basically the best title to start the series with since I only have a 360 and my PC. So longtime fans of this series that for whatever reason are reading this reveiw keep in mind that i'm completely new to this series.\n\nTL;DR VERSION AT THE BOTTOM.\n\nI'll go into gameplay and mechanics first and this might be lengthy so prepare:\nThe gameplay is honestly really fun and exciting. Not only do battles start without any loading and takes place right where you encountered the enemy (giving it really good immersion) but they also have this really hectic and fast pace feeling to them. Firstly the battle zone is surprisingly big (unless you get caught in a corner, narrow corridor or god forbid doorway) so you have a lot of room to move around to cast spells or to heal party members or to simply recouperate your SC. Now what is SC? Well it's basically the limiting factor put onto you to keep you from just steamrolling everything. You see, instead of giving you a mana bar to limit your spell casts and giving your basic attacks infinite uses they give you SC which is drained with every action you do besides blocking and running. While this might sound very annoying at first I actually think it's a brilliant system since now I can freely cast spells and combine them with my basic attacks to have insane combos. Also since even your basic attacks drain the SC they don't need to make your martial artes (basic attacks) weak or underwhelming compared to your hidden artes (basically the spells.) In fact with some characters it's actually more pleasing and satisfying using martial artes instead of hidden artes (Sorrey and Dezel). This is even more apparent when you use the armatus which is basically a superform in this game and apparently a new feature in the Tales games. When you use the Armatus two of your characters that are linked together will combine and make a stronger form that has it's own moves but has the combined stats of both previous characters. However as I said everything you do drains SC and because of this you must control how much you do in a short amount of time otherwise you'll find yourself in the middle of a group of enemies without anything to do and just take a bunch of hits.\n\nI would go into the other mechanics but I'll sum up the gameplay and battle system as interesting and strategic since there is a lot of things you can do in a single battle to rack up some massive damage and combos. However it should be noted that there's no way to control the camera and there can be times where it seriously ♥♥♥♥s up.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is quite lively and colorful. It has clear contrast so that's its really colorful without being too bright and annoying and this really fleshes out a lot of the areas since almost everything sticks out by itself while also blending in with the background. The towns could use a bit more work on them but ultimately still feel like they're actual towns and cities. Open feilds (my favorite areas honestly) are suprisingly big and gives you a sense of vastness and that you're actually traveling across the continent. This is enhanced even further with the draw range of the game. They really seemed to take the time to make sure that everything physical in these areas would look good both near and far which again makes it hard to tell where the wall of the area is without looking at the map which I believe is good. Dungeons however are painfully straight forward and small. You'll find yourself kinda bored and unexcited about what you have to do there when you're not fighting the mobs.\n\nNow the chracters and story is what kind of makes this and oddball for me. On a personal level I like a few of the character Edna being my favorite closely followed by Alisha. However there are a lot of archetype characters that are pretty unamusing sadly with a few of them painfully stereotypical (I'm looking at you Dezel). While on the other hand you have characters that simply don't act accordingly to what they do (specifically Rose) and then you have Laliah who is just queer, sometimes I really like her and other times I find her annoying or stupid. This gives the party a schizophrenic feeling and gives the player obvious favortism. I always try to use Edna and Laliah as much as I can while keeping Mikleo and Dezel on standby unless I need them or they simply make the battle easier.\n\n[SPOILERS IN THIS SECTION!!!]\nAs far as the story goes it's...well...it could be better honestly...a lot better actually. It's pretty stereotypical and can be summarized as a more cliche version of Ocarina of Time without the time travel and more characters which I can deal with and even enjoy since a lot the of character interactions can be funny. However one character in the game pretty much ruined the entire story for me and that's Rose. You see before you meet Rose it's implied and almost blatantly explained that only the Sheperd can use the armatus however within literally 10 minutes of interactions with Rose it's established that she can use the armatus too which really breaks the whole story. You see apparently Dezel was messing with her mind and body since she was little so that he could use her as a vessel for the armatus however this made her very easily controllable when using it and also gave her the ability to see and speak to seraphim as well. Now the biggest problem I have with this is that it makes no freaking sense on how or even why she uses the armatus. Okay maybe she does have a lot of resonance but the reason why the Sheperd can use it is because his power is linked and intertwined with another Seraphim. Not only that it's up to the human to use it in the first place so how is it possible for a seraphim to force her to use the armatus and is the reason why she can use it at all when it requires the human to say their name and to give them access to it. The explanation for her power was really weak and story breaking but going even further beyond that is that she joins the party for literally no reason whatsoever other than "sure, why not." and everyone just goes with it from there on.\n\nWell that was pretty lenghty.\nUltimately I would recommend this game. I find the combat fun and exciting and it makes it a blast to grind through. The enviorment and atmosphere can be beautiful and colorful and the interactions between characters is quite charming.\n\nTL;DR VERSION\nFun gameplay. Good graphics. Good atmosphere. Some characters are good others are bad. Story is cliche and not really good but neither is it really bad. Dungeons are too linear but feilds are great. Camera can be really stupid sometimes. I'll give this game a 7-8/10.  It could definitely use some work in a few places but the gameplay is the best part and it's really fun.","October 31, 2015","true","59.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I end up investing heavily in stats I would otherwise ignore in order to keep them alive.

Especially as a veteran [Tales of] fan. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n(Fans of this game on STEAM are probably going to vote me down. Ok look. This might be the only Tales of game aside from Symphonia you've played. I understand. But I've played more than 10 titles in the franchise so I'm just speaking from that perspective. You can love the game, I just can't despite how much I want to.)\n\nTales of Zestiria is an alright game. It's worth about 45 hours of content on one playthrough. The game pans out like an action RPG, the plot is alright (some girls might like it a lot though), the graphics are pretty, and the gameplay is...\n\nWell, that's what I really don't like. About 10 hours in I was only onboard for the story and acheivements. There is nothing else I think is worthwhile about this game past that. I'm sure this is highly rated on Steam, but I found the gameplay to be terrible. The story is pretty entertaining, but a couple horus of cutscenes cannot hold up the entire game for me.\n\nThe writing ToZ is just not quite up there either. It's fujoshi bait. I'm a fujoshi. But I'd rather watch someone else play this game, really.\n\nThe game tells you about this amazing world, and how there's such a rich history behind it, but we don't ever get much of a glimpse at it past the main plot. There are monuments in ancient writing scattered throughout the world, and they use it for tutorial, not world building. For 30 hours.\n\nThere are stretches of dungeons that is too big, too empty, and brain dead. The Great Camelot Bridge takes you a full 3 minutes to go through, and that's a straight line.  Tutorials are constantly telling you how to play the game even 30 hours in.\n\nThe dungeon design in this game is absolutely asinine. Since the battle system takes place EXACTLY where you run into the monsters and the battlefield is huge, the map in turn has to be obscenely huge. All you get is huge rooms and boring corridors just because they wanted to shoehorn that poorly thought out feature in. This is even worse in the Alisha DLC. $15 and two hours worse. You run through a dungeon for TWO DAMN HOURS. (Look up youtube.)\n\nThe battle itself is aggravating as well. But some people like it. I found myself fighting against the camera most of the time. The battlefield is usually so huge that you can't see enemies to your left or right. Which is trouble since the battle plays out like a game of rocket tag. If you don't defend on the higher levels, you will die. You want a messy challenge where your party members get KO'd 26 times in a single boss fight because of that? Try this, then. Of course, there's AI stupidity at play too.\n\nThe balancing here has some pretty strong MMO grinding feel to it. The padding I felt from this game is incredibly bad.\n\nOnce again, I found this to be an ok game. Playing through this made me so angry and disappointed I wish I was playing Tales of Vesperia on the console which is exponentially better than this garbage of a Tales game.\n\nTL;DR: I consider this to be the worst Tales of title aside from Tempest due to all the poor design that went into this, and I think people should give the other Tales of a try to see what I really mean.","April 30","false","75.2"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","3"

There were far too many pop-up tutorial/information screens (even for the most basic of mechanics like what HP is). I don't like this approach as I would much rather explore menus and discover things for myself instead of constantly feeling as though the devs thought very little of the player's intelligence.\nThere were some seemingly complex features and a lot of it I found unintuitive... I get the game has to teach them to the player but surely there are better ways than this immersion-breaking method.\n\nIn the short time I played I also found the dungeons and locations very static and uninteractive (and sometimes needlessly big and open). Walking through empty uninteractive room to empty uninteractive room with little to no interesting sights became quickly grinding on my experience.\n\nOn a plus side, great animated cut scenes and decent character graphics.

The fights are really smooth even for "30 fps".\n\nNo crash or audio issues so far (only problem I had is no voice over if I selected 5.1 but I don't have a true 5.1 setup so it might be on my end, but stereo sound works fine).\n\nEdit : After some hours in, the game is really FUN, I'm killing every monster I encounter, it seems pretty confusing at first but its not the case.

Zestria has none of that (so that I have experienced so far); focusing on pure fantasy elements, and I like it. The scenery is enjoyable to look at (ruins and cities in the distance especially, despite that the graphics feel "last generation") and the soundtrack gives you an epic adventure embarkment feeling.\n\nI look foreward to playing through the rest of this game!

English voice actors do a good job, great music, and decent story. Is it the best port ever? No. Is is a BAD port? I wouldn't say so. The 30 fps lock may bother some, I hardly notice it. The only con for me so far is the screen tearing, which apparently is an easy fix if you force v sync, and I'm sure the little bugs will be patched soon. Japanese studios are notorious for thier really bad PC ports, and this is good in comparison to many. No, it's not perfect, but hopefully this game paves the way for more Japanese devs to bring thier games over to PC. If you are a fan of JRPGs and want to help support more of them coming to PC, I would recommend purchasing this game. It is definitely worth the money. It's a great game with some minor annoyances on PC, all in all I would heavily recommend the game for fans of the genre.","October 19, 2015","true","11.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It is however , still primarily a Playstation 3 game so don't expect anything you will see from the triple AAA games in 2015. One of the major complains from the fans is the game is still locked in its good old-fashion 30 Frame rate . It shouldn't be too notice-able unless you are a graphic and performance police  , but even by the general standard in 2015 , a 60 fps solid port will make your fans much happier  , Namco Bandai.\n\nAdditionally , there is a fan-made mod that seems to enable 60 fps but I have had occassional game crashes with that , so I wouldn't recommend installing it ( at least at the time of writing this review )\n\nAnd what makes this Tales game special ? This is apparently the Tales team first effort go Open-world with Tales game , the world map are pretty large to explore and traveling from town to towns may take a while , with the occasionally interesting discovery . Despite of having a larger world map  , most of the location are still somewhat boring and bland to look at .\n\nThe combat system itself is pretty fun  , your typical Tales - smash N smash . Easy to play , hard to master . And great thing is this time you get to quick-switch among all your active party members in the combat , nobody is left behind.\n\nSo why wouldn't I recommend the game ? Because the Game Story is a complete mess.\nAnd that is actually an understatement . Not only the writing is a disaster , the story presentation is boring , plot progression is terrible , it is a trainwreck and make less sense than your local music channel.  To be fair , The tales team did tried to grow out of the jRPG stereotypes and attempt new things . While the open-world seamless combat transition works pretty well here , the story presentation just couldn't make the cut.\n\n\nPerhaps Bandai Namco should hire a proper writer  , because they are not only getting old but getting worse.\n\n\nIt's a jRPG ,  many may argue the recent jRPG don't really has good story , but this one has probably one of the worst out there.\n\nTL;DR : good port from the ps4 version ,  with pretty fun combat at first which eventually gets too complicated , grinding for high end equipment takes years , story doesn't make senses , plots a mess .","February 5","false","48.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I'm writting this review to serve as a warning, Zestiria is a masterpiec that has suffered a terrible accident, it recovered enough to limp back to life but is forever crippled for it. That's the best way to describe the travesty of this game.\n\n*As a notice the following may contain spoilers*\n\nZestiria is a tales game, a member of one of the few JRPG linages to survive to the modern age. It was hyped as most of it's kind is of being the greatest new thing. Beautiful open and traversable areas, HD graphics [ though since I played it on a modest laptop most of that was turned down to avoid inducing a computer anyersum],  and flawless control - there were problems with the PS3 release, the system was just not powerful enough and the game was poorly optimized for it, but that's a a different can of worms. For the most part it delivers, accompanied by the as usual amazing Tales Soundtracks.\n\nThe Characters are a blast and have that classic interaction and quirky fun that one expects from Namco, and the expected interactions are all there.\n\nBUT... that's pretty much all of the good parts.\n\nWhile it is a vast, and beautifuly expansive world, it is rather empty. There are a grand total of 7 towns in the entire game   in addition to 4 destoryed villages (that are simply desolate areas related to simple side quests ) and the final dungeon which is a town in a similar state as the other four - destoryed houses little to explore and no soul living or dead inhabiting it.\n\nMuch of the game consists of vast open plains with few sights and the forest dungeons are all horrendously similar to the each other similar to repeats of the maze area before the bladlands in Xillia 1. The actual dungeons are even more depressing, save for the 4 shrines and the beginning and ending dungeons, each one is identical in features differing only in the color of the walls  - from blue, red, gray and purple metal/stone among other colors - and their basic layout. The remind me more of fallout out bunkers than any ancient ruin.\n\nAnd here is where it gets frustrating, because Zestiria isn't just bad, it has a lot of good, which makes the bad worse. The first Dungeon, is an amazing stone ruin featuring a theme of South American temples and shrines, most closely resembling - at least in my view - Mayan, Incan and Aztec architecture. Since this was the first dungeon and I had seen nothing else, going off what I had heard of the game I had hoped the future areas of the game would continue this trend and take various styles of native ruins from around the world or perhaps just the Americas even. I was wrong, and it is quite possibly the best designed and most colorful of the dungeons.\n\nThings unfortunately get worse from there. A JRPG has many unique elements but the essencial one is the story. And that's where Zestira drops the ball... HARD.\n\nI'm not going into a ton of detail but basically the story is abysmal and barely makes sense. It's full of more plot holes that Swiss cheese. Further the story seems to just shift around a lot, I don't know how to describe it more than that, that it's unstable.\n\nA big complaint is that the first Female MC gets replaced 1/3 or the way through the game by another girl who remains the Female MC for the rest of the came. It was poorly advertised and handled. It feels that either the second character was either shoehorned in or her role greatly expanded at the last hour without changing the story to compensate. Some have suggested that perhaps the game was meant to in the second half alternate back and forth between both female protagonists and their respective wind elemental partners, there do remain some parts of the story that might suggest that. The second female MC and her wind element partner are part of a group of assassins that feel like they were forced into the game. You could take at least the assassins if not her and the her partner out of the game and make a few small changes and nothing would be really different.\n\nFurther it's clear that the story was cut appart and put back togeather several times and at diffrent stages either to adapt for gameplay or differing ideas. It gives the feeling of several versions of a story from roughest draft to final copy un paper cliped and tossed around then reassembled without any regard that page 44 is from the final draft page 22 from the first and pagest 31-8 from various middle stages.\n\nBecause of all of this other segments of the story suffer. A history with most Tales villains is that they are well intentioned extreamists, they do what they do because they sincerely believe it is the key to utopia or a better life for all, even of many must be sacrificed along the way. This is charactistic of Mithos, Van, Ratatosk and Richter, Richard, Nachtigal and Gaius. The villain of Zestiria has none of that, he was basically cursed, by a corrupted god and an insane priest for being a pragmatic miliatary leader. Horrible things happened to him, so he turned evil or rather finally gave into evil and wants to destory the world as it is now his job to do so, if anyting the real villain of the whole story is never really given much back ground and it's just hand waved that he died after cursing the bad guy.\n\nFurther evidence of rushing with the game can be found in mentions of a third "northern" region that pops up in conversations towards middle of the second half of the game. This region is never visited but had ample map room, further more in a desert area in the end of the game there is a giant castle like gate covered with markings similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics. It is never mentiond by the characters or the game and appears as but a piece of scenery. It's attention to detail howerver shows that it must have clearly served a purpose and it is in the perfect position to be a gate to these northern regions that form a large blank spot on the world map.\n\nFurther, there seems to be no Tales twist, the ubiquitous event near the middle of the game that turns the player's and often the character's notion of the world completely on it's head. For Symphonia it's the existence of Te'thala, Graces Fodra, Dawn of a New world Emil is Ratatosk, Abyss the world is floating over an ocean of miasma and Luke is a clone. Xillia, the existance of Elympios. There is no such twist in Zestiria, yes there is the idea that you come from the so called "doomed town" but that has no importantance on the story's plot and is found out at the end of the game.\n\nAnother thing is all the tales games seem to have some sort of "moral" or center to them. Abyss is "you define who you are" Symphonia is "what is best may not always be right" Dawn is "Walk a mile in another's shoes" Graces is "Friendship conquers all" Xillia "compassion and understanding can build a better world" (it also had an underlying enviromental message). Zestiria ... I don't know what I got out of it..."Killing is okay if the person is evil." And okay I somewhat jest but there's really not much there... maybe "self-sacrifice or don't carry burdens alone" if you squint a look at it at a 42 degree angle in the right light.\n\nSo, in the end from a play and visual standpoint Zestiria is a rather good game. But the lack of elaboration given the visual capabilities the game had at it's disposal, and the train wreck of it's story make it a disaster that at least at it's current price I cannot recommend in good conscience.\n\n-JHEE\n\n","February 5","false","76.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

You'd think at least the pure-hearted main character would object, but really, he doesn't. I guess Zestiria follows up on Xillia 2's trend of becoming "Drakengard lite", since, among other things, most of your party consists of dead people. No, really. Either way, if you assume the game that was released for the 20th anniversary of the franchise has amazing, complex and interesting plot, then you're in for huge disappointment. Zestiria's story is absolutely terrible. It's like they've written a solid storyline initially, then realized it was too dark and edgy and self-censored it to oblivion and beyond, thus dropping all the imaginable plot points, character development and progression, making it an absolute chore to follow the game through and actually complete it. Pacing is weird, and timeline is all messed up and can't make up it's mind about how many years have passed since "certian events". At least the gameplay is pretty fun... for a 30 fps game, and the main cast of characters is quite charming and has amusing interactions.\nOverall it's a JRPG that holds together better than some of them, but isn't really worth your time and money unless it's your first Tales game or you're a diehard fan of the series who collects merchandise like a maniac and has approximately 100 straps of your favourite gay ship attached to your cell phone.","February 3","false","54.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","3","2","0"

You'll be wanting to block but will be stuck in a several second long attack animation.\n\nThe dungeons are awful. Most of them have absolutely nothing interesting besides the combat. And that gets old fast, especially when the camera gets stuck looking into a wall when fighting in tight spaces.\nThere's almost nothing in the way of puzzle solving, something that was a staple of dungeons in previous 'Tales of' games.\n\nWhen you use a Holy Bottle to avoid combat, and find yourself running through dungeons with absolutely noting to do in them besides run to the end, that's when you know the designers utterly failed.\nNot just because there's nothing interesting besides combat but also because the Holy Bottle doesn't fade away until you rest at an inn. And since you aren't getting into combat, that could be for a long while.\n\nThis game has too many flaws for me to recommend it.\nGo play Tales of Symphonia instead. Graphics may be older but it's so much better in every aspect.\nDon't bother with Zestiria unless it's on a really good sale.\n","February 1","false","30.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The only way to become stronger really is to invest your time in the weapon levelling system, which is..... not fun.\n\nSay goodbye to regular attacks, EVERY attack you make now consumes TP, and the only way to replenish TP is to stand still for a couple of seconds, completely breaking the flow of combat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/almajo/recommended/351970/","almajo","weisslightning","http://steamcommunity.com/id/almajo/","401 products in account","I've played almost every Tales game released in English and I have a pretty high tolerance for their typically awful stories and narrative so long as the fighting is good.\n\nDespite that this is the second mainline game I haven't reached the end credits in, the first being Legendia. The combat, and especially the boss fights, are really poor and the story is possibly the worst I've seen; nothing interesting happens in the middle, maybe, thirty hours of the game. For context, this is a forty hour game. Usually these games have some sort of plot twist to keep things engaging, but nothing unexpected happens here. Plot progress is almost entirely relegated to your characters learning about things that have already happened. Despite war being a theme of the game, war doesn't actually happen outside of the designated Ravaged Battlefield area, and even then, only twice in the game.\n\nThe combat should have been the game's saving grace but they really trashed the combat from Graces F. Stamina (SC) replaces CC, and it acts similarly but as a gauge rather than a number. This gives more granularity to the system but I'm not sure that this is really necessary. It doesn't limit you as much as Graces F early on, but you're still limited by how long it takes to learn your basic artes. In the end I feel like the CC system gives you a much more concise indicator of what you can do, and was implimented in a way that made it more visible to the player.\n\nArmitization allows you to merge with one of your party members to make a super form relating to one of the four elements. Armitized forms have only three moves per basic combo, rather than four, and are focused on elemental damage whereas normally your basic combo incorporates elements in different branches eg. second right is fire, second left is water etc. What this means is that you are going to be doing the same few attacks over and over, without regard or thought for which you're using, with fewer characters active and less potential for heavy comboing. You're encouraged to use this form a LOT in boss fights because they often are the best way to do damage. Incidentally, bosses have a lot of health so you'll be spending a lot of time doing this, probably thinking about other, better things you could be doing given the remarkable complexity of the human mind.\n\nI'd like to clarify something before I finish. I've finished Phantasia, Destiny, Eternia, Symphonia, Abyss, Vesperia, Graces F, Xillia, Xillia 2, Hearts R. Yes, even Hearts. I didn't really enjoy Xillia that much but it at least got me to the end credits. Early in the game I expected Zesty to pull itself together, like Graces did, and get way better but that point didn't arrive. Nothing happened. If anything, it got worse.\n\nProper credit to Namco for the port though.

The story is a traditional terrible Japanese anime information dump of pointless names, senseless jargon and utterly meaningless connections that interrupt the flow of battle and story at irritating consistencies.

It get's worse too; Key story points for obtaining certain party members are dropped and never mentioned again in any fashion after an hour. And to top it all of there are NO sidequests of any kind. Each and every one of the "optional" quests you can do turn out to be not so optional within minutes and are forced upon you to progress. The story itself, for what it is, is also rediculously short. Synopsys (Ya ya spoiler warning)\n-you save woman\n-you follow same woman to save her again\n-become hero by necessity (also the cliche that you are the only one who can do it BS)\n-lose to boss man\n-complete 4 "trials" that are not trials at all\n-forced running around to complete the "side quests" to learn the past of the boss man\n-beat boss man.\n---> As previously stated it looks like it would dive into some good psychological depth early on but it's all dropped in 5 minutes.\n\n\nNow for combat:\n-Limited to 3 attacks at a time NO EXCEPTIONS. Enemies are not limited thusly.\n-Also limited by "fatigue" (called something else). Not sure if enemies have this or not.\n-all magic only costs fatigue and nothing else\n-Magic is convoluted, especially healing\n-all magic is uselesly long to cast unless the caster goes mellee, completely making magic pointless as your casters get mauled because their AI is so derp no matter the settings. Casters also don't have the health, defenses, or physical attack to do any good as non-casters. (starting to see the problem?)\n-Enemies gain magical-Jesus-BS-armor randomly, even mid juggle, and become immune to all stagger and take massively reduced damage. This usually results in a party wipe as the AI stands there and dies one after another as you try in vain to pull the enemy off of them.\n-Some enemy attacks are stupidly broken: For example one enemy throws his spear at you, bu instead of being a line attack it is battlefield wide AOE that instagibs the entire party. This enemy is just regular world type too, not even a sub-sub-boss.\n-all in all combat is difficult because of poor design, not legitimate dificulty.\n\nThere are possitives though:\n-the world is pretty nice looking and so are all the entities. Though graphics don't at all make a game in my opinion it is nice to look at.\n-character names are very original and most character in your party actually have a personality.\n\n\nI cannot recomend this game to anyone who wants more than a hack-n-slash; but it can befun on those rare ocassions that all the BS stops and you stop caring about the lack of story. Even though I don't recommend it and will not play it solo any longer I could see it actually being a pretty good multiplayer combat experience for most of it.\n\nTL;DR:\n-Go back and read it, I won't enable your lazyness.","December 28, 2015","false","61.9"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","4","13","2","0"

And since then has only improved upon and critiqued it's unique style of gameplay over the years. It is hands down, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite game series of all time.  That's because with each installment in the series it delivers what I've come to love and expect from all the Tales games , with added improvements. So here are a few things you can expect when playing a Tales game.\n\nWhat to expect -\n\n*Free Motion Battle System- A combat system where you actively move around in the battle and can attack freely in real time, using lots of cool combos and skills. The technical name for the  battle system has changed with each improvement so I'll just call it the free motion battle system.\n\n*Engaging character's - What really brings the Tales games to life is it's characters and their interactions together. Even the small chit-chats they have, or skits, make the characters feel alive and the conversations feel real.\n\n*Story - A story driven game over several hours with lot's of side quests to do.\n\n*The world - Exploring the vast world, the towns, the npcs and all the hidden things within that world.\n\n*Longevity - The Tales games are long, great, games. Not  short games you can just blast through in one sitting. And if you plan to unlock everything then it's even longer. Yay!\n\n*NG+ - A feature rarely seen anymore these days but Tales has kept it alive in every installment.\n\nNow I know it's a bit early to post a review since the game just released, so I will edit this review as I play through the game. But in the mean time I just wanted to show some love <3","October 19, 2015","true","3.5"," 24 of 55 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","24","55","0","0"

The best way to sum up this game is an ambitious game that didn't have enough time, money, or talent to fully realize what the developers were going for.\n\nIn the past, battles that the player encountered would take you away into an instanced battle map (think of the Final Fantasy series). ToZ decided to make the battles take place where you encounter them which in theory sounds great but design decisions behind this choice influenced the maps of the world so much so that the open fields became at times 10x bigger than past games with nothing interesting populating these desolate fields. This is not mentioning how the camera fights you in combat to the point where you are unable to fully survey the battle. The camera will get caught on just about everything making battles just the pits sometimes.\n\nGrinding in ToZ isn't for exp but for gear. While you receive exp for killing monsters on the field the exp gains are designed to give the player very little exp but instead you need to kill monsters for the gear that they drop so you can fuse it into other similar gear to level them up to make your characters stronger. This wouldn't be so bad if the AI partners in the game weren't some of the worst programmed in the modern series.\n\nAI partners are brain dead and at higher difficulty settings severely limit the player because of how awful they are. This is because the game is designed around the two human characters to fuse with the four elemental "seraphs" and to balance this if you are not fused you have a smaller hp pool and your attacks don't do as much damage but you have 4 characters on the field as opposed to 2 in your fused forms. Because HP is so low and enemy boss encounters will always be about 15+ levels higher than you your AI partners will get beat down very fast because they lack the ability to defend themselves.\n\nThe story has many plot holes, plot lines that are picked up and dropped off whenever, and pacing that is downright bad. The game never ups the ante because of the initial premise of the story which makes it very hard for the tension to escalate which is your classic "demon lord going to destroy the world scenario". This wouldn't have been so bad if you cared anything for the characters but it is so hard to care for these characters when they offer very little.\n\nThe point in the story which I literally yelled at my screen because of how stupid it was is when a villain who is introduced very early in the game and then vanishes for 50% of the game only to reappear because the writers forgot about him and they needed someone to do something to make character development happen. Mind you, in the time of this villain's disappearance nobody has mentioned him even though the main character, Sorey, would have every reason to ask the other human partner because of the relationship between the villain and her. I can not reiterate it enough this character was completely dropped and picked up because a bad person needed to do a bad thing.\n\nCharacter development in ToZ is baffling there is no other way to put it. Instead of slowly building up characters they either give a huge character dump all at once, let the character keep hitting the same one note, or very small character development which doesn't get furthered. I cared nothing for these characters save maybe 2, 3 if you really push it.\n\nDungeon designs save for the four elemental trials are very repetitive and force the player to fight in confined spaces because they are a dungeon. This means that the aforementioned bad camera does the player no favors.\n\nThe reasons why I can not recommend this game comes from both a long time fan of the series having played over 10+ of their titles and as a gamer. The fan in me says it a difficult sell to other fans of the series but to them I still wouldn’t recommend it. The gamer in me says that if you took away the “Tales of” and if this was just some random game I would honestly say that it is bad.\n\nAfter playing the other games in the franchise I can say that this is the only game in which I put down my control got cheat engine and turned on super speed because the nonsensical story, characters, grinding, and battles broke me.\n\nEdit: 5/4/2016\n\nAfter beating this game I can safely say that the story is plagued with plotholes and pacing problems.\n\nI understand what they were trying to go for but ultimately the story was poorly told. There is a decent story hidden here but it never fully came out. The story for the first 8 hours is great but after that it starts going downhill.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game at a 50$ price tag wait till it goes down to 20$ or lower. As for the DLC I wouldn't recommend paying for it at all. Watch it on youtube if you are curious.","April 28","false","41.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

Forgive me if I miss something hugely different when playing on a decent system.\n\nThe Big Problem The major issue that I had with this game, and what I feel most people had problems with but were unable to articulate, was that it failed to be engaging. I would rather sit and watch all of the skits than actually play the game. The visuals are beautiful, the characters are charming, the story is interesting; however, Zestiria failed to engage me. To put it simply, I would rather watch someone play this game  than play it myself. And even then I would expect them to do a lot of skipping around to get to the important parts that people actually want to see.\n\nJust comparing it to another JRPG I'm going to compare this to what I believe is one of the greatest JRPG's in recent years, Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade is very similar to Zestiria is a lot of ways, but Xenoblade just does it better. The world is immersive and much more interesting than Zestiria, the visuals are fantastic for a game on the Wii and even better on the 3DS, and the characters are so fun that the people in your party are more often decided by how fun they are to have around than their combat potential. And Xenoblade engages the player, much better than Zestiria ever does.\n\nIn Zestiria, the combat felt really lackluster to me. Not to say that it wasn't flashy, but  I felt no need to spend my time caring about the combat.  If I felt particularly lazy, I could just set my characters to auto combat and let them take over. And even if I wasn't lazy I didn't have the ability to participate in the story. Sure, you play as Sorey learning about your Shepherd powers and fighting Malevolence but I felt more like an observer than a player.  It wasn't engaging.\n\nBack to Xenoblade, the combat requires the players full attention. Rather than just spamming the attack button (which is an entirely viable strategy in Zestiria), one must pay close attention to which character has the enemy's aggro and what arts your partners are using and what status the enemy has. And the story requires more than just walking places and watching cutscenes. Plus,  Xenoblade has side quests, which Zestiria has none of.  When the story progresses no matter what decision you make, and there aren't any side missions to take your mind off of the endless cutscenes, the game just becomes a slog of walking to the next set of cutscenes and scripted battles.\n\nZestiria should be an anime Now, Zestiria is not a bad game. It's a good anime. Seriously, if Tales of Zestiria were an anime I would watch the entire thing like three times. But when the game says walk here, which takes twice as long as it should on my slow computer, just to watch another cutscene it really bothers a player who expected to do something during this game.\n\nTo conclude, Zestiria has a lot of potential as a game. It has wonderful characters, a really good looking world, and a story that I wish I had time to experience. But this game fails to recognize the players role in advancing the story, aside from walking to the next objective on the map. So I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who wants to play something. But if some studio decided to make Tales of Zestiria as an anime, I'm very interested.","January 19","false","31.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

But even as a fan of the series, it's been difficult for me to sit down and play the game for more than an hour.\n\nStory-wise, the game is...ok.  Tales series are not necessarily known for their wonderous stories, but I've always found them a bit less stereotypical than most typical RPGs.  This title however just feels a bit more forced - you see the gears grinding too hard, and the games nearly 3-hour long tutorial doesn't help.  The plot is also confusing - some characters can't be "seen" by most of the characters, but then you still fight with them...it's just confusing, and I feel that it takes too much hand-waving and exposition to setup.  The characters don't help the game along. Unlike some other titles in the series, the characters are very stock, almost perfect, and cling around one or two traits which just get tiring to play listen to. The lines are basically exposition, the jokes are flat, and cring-moments are high even for a series that takes it as a given.\n\nCombat wise, as a fan familiar with the series, I just wanted to get in and learn the system while fighting in actual combat. But the game holds your hand for so long, it just gets boring.  Yet, it's difficult to just zone out during these moments; the game's combat system is very complex, so complex that I feel newcomers will be put off, and old fans will have to sit through the monotonous basic zones in order to pick out the more complex systems that come during these otherwise trying segments.  Still, if you are into micro-mangment, it can be fun. But to perfectly min-max your combat battles takes a level of computer-controlled player management and menu-screen fiddling that makes you question why you're not just playing a turn-based game in the first place.  Playing with friends locally, however, really enriches the experience if you have some buddies who will actually put up with the dialogue and down-time.\n\nHonestly, just wait until Tales of Symphonia is released on Steam.  Its a far, far better game despite being so much older.  It's a much better example of the series being done right. The storyline is as cheesy, but its characters feel human, and and the heart of its gameplay and story beat lies a complex moral question that just feels much stronger than "angels saving the world."\n","December 20, 2015","false","4.8"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Oh The world needs saving? better not give a back story" I cried in nearly every tales game. But i felt no emotional connectivity for this game. Considering it's a Rpg. 60% of the game became dead to me.\n\nMystic artes are a let down - The artes in this game are not flashy at all. Ranging from 1.3-4 seconds of animation. with little to pathetic damage. In most instances it's really not worth using it as to save your party from dieing.\n\nLack of devil arms - Yeah you heard me. No devil arms. Just some paper weaponry that has zero stats. Can't scale and you can only equip skills on it. ( which trust me, only means 10% increase on damage or so. really worth equipping a higher tier weapon)\n\nSeperah - Yeah. The magical beings are a huge let down. They are litterally just humans. I don't know how characters can tell them apart. They don't have any physical features that let you know they are devine beings. Come on namco atleast give them elf ears or something!\n\nIn conclusion: If you played all the previous tales games go for it. it's going to be a long wait for the next game but please please please consider getting a previous titles. the gameplay is less grapical then xillia and less interesting then paint drying. sorry to say of course.","October 28, 2015","false","56.8"," 14 of 35 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","14","35","3","1"

The skits and the soundtracks at times make the game seem better than it is. However, the gameplay is very boring. The combat is okay, but you spend a lot of time walking around from place to place. You do this until you are able to save-point travel, but even dungeons have a lot of pointless walking. A lot of the areas are really empty and are just big for no apparent reason. The AI is also very terrible for your teammates. They do the most stupid things and do not follow commands a lot of the time. The camera in combat is also terrible. You can't control the camera manually during combat and it tends to point towards walls and you are unable to see what is going on until you reposition your character. In conclusion, I would not reccomend this game for the current price, it should have been priced around $15 rather than $50.","November 5, 2015","false","47.7"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Being 2015, with the gaming advances we've made, and seeing how this game is being sold for $54.99 (CDN), I expected a lot more than the usual cringe worthy and awkwardly spaced dialogue we've seen in the past as well as a very stiff combat system. id still give this game a 5/10, maybe higher if the content matched the price.","October 28, 2015","false","0.6"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","1"

I like the idea of being able to customize your party's clothing and hair. The new system where you combine with seraph and gain special powers is a cool idea. The newest Tales game I played was Tales of the Abyss, so the new way to get around the map is appealing. I think if you can't find a decent newer game to play, this might be for you.\n\nBut on the other hand, I personally think the characters are very flat and hard to get attached to. Like I said before, I like character interaction, but there is a ridiculous amount of cutscenes in this game so far. I find myself zoning out whenever a cutscene plays now. The main story of the Shepard's duty and defeating malevolence is good and all, but that side mission about "following your dreams" and exploring ruins to keep the main character happy is pretty lame. It doesn't even seem like the main character and his life-long friend are that excited about ruins now. Also, the characters joining the party did mention their reasons, but they still seemed so complacent about devoting themselves to a cause and putting their life on the line.\n\ntl;dr For me, it's a boring game, but it's not completely terrible. I'd say if you're really curious about playing it, don't bother buying it and just pirate it.","October 25, 2015","false","14.2"," 17 of 42 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","17","42","0","1"

After playing Vesperia and Symphonia, I have a decent standard for the tales series and this game doesn't come anywhere close to it. So here is my opinion on the game after 7 hours before uninstalling it.\n\nPros:\n- Cover art is pretty.\n- Skit quality and their full body animations were the freshest thing about this game. (Crache)\n\nCons:\n- The story is hard to play through because it's so bland and predictable.\n(I feel like I'm gonna sleep for 3 days ohwowIsleptfor3dayswhathappened.)\n\n- None of these characters that you meet or play have any depth to them.\n(Except Sorey. He's got feathers for earrings wow.)\n\n- Overworld design is so empty that it's depressing.\n(But don't worry because there's some completely not-out-of-place glowing Saffron next to this bush.)\n\n- Monolith placement and their exceptional skill at awkwardly breaking the 4th wall.\n(Ancient words of wisdom is to not buy this game.)\n\n- The camera in combat is frustrating especially if you're in a dungeon hallway.\n(Where am I)\n\n- The equipment skill system is so unnecessary and cluttered.\n(Difens -> Defense)\n\n- Combat is all about spamming your armament until you see 'Power Hit' appear.\n(Up on the d-pad isn't the answer. Try left.)\n\n- Post-combat dialogue is cringe-worthy.\n(Purification Complete!)\n\n- Trying to hit an enemy to start a pre-emptive attack is frustrating when your hitbox is at elbow length.\n(SuperSneakyA+yeah)\n\n- Every NPC has 1 of 2 designs. Brown/White shirt with Brown/White Pants. Or a Royal Knight.\n(Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V)\n\n- The name "Shepherd"\n(Seriously?)\n\nVerdict:\nI would rather spend this money on cheese sticks. At least cheese sticks would keep me in suspense of whether or not the cheese was melted.","October 28, 2015","false","7.1"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","38","12","32","4","8"

What a waste of money, a huge disappointment.\n\n-------Negatives:\n\nConstant interupts of ingame cutscenes that take away the control of your character for trivial dialog that doesn't progress the plot.  Ever watch an Anime and find yourself skipping ahead 2-4 seconds to get past boring ♥♥♥♥?  You'll be doing that a lot in this game.  Mashing X to ship 20 lines of meaningless dialog.\n\nAnimation of so poor for a $55 usd game thats been in development for 2+ years...  with the past experience of previous Tales games.  Main character walks/runs like theres something wrong with him.  Water flows in ways physically impossible.  Lifeless actors in the world, unblinking eyes.  Limited facial expression in dialog,  THE UNCANNY VALLY is strong in this game!\n\nThe story, good god the story.  The hero of the game is an ordinary human that lives among the invisable guardians of the realm.  Why? Who cares!  The evil returns to the world, and a new saviour must be chosen.  Why?  Who cares!  Plot!  Our human main character assumes the burden of being the new saviour because he's a good guy and wants to save humanity!  He doesn't do a THING to earn the blessing of guardians.  Maybe 20m after being branded the Saviour he aquires the ability to go ♥♥♥♥ing SUPER SAIYAN after fighting a pack of blob/slim monsters that are literally of no threat to him.  He does NOTHING to earn this incredible power thats ment to save the world.  And this all happens in the FIRST ♥♥♥♥ING HOUR OF THE GAME.\n\nThe game does nothing to ease you into an unnessesary complex combat system, and has all avenues of difficulty thrown at your face 20% into the game.  I understand they do this so you grow into it so your prepared for tough battles when they hit you .  It's overwhelming and unnessesary, especially considering combat mechanics of past Tales games.\n\nWant to play the game in English?  Prepair to laugh your ♥♥♥ off, while cringing until your face stays that way.  It's dreadful, missmatched voices everywhere.  A cultural difference not accounted for.\n\n-------Positives:\n\nThe art is stellar.  The textures of the assets in the world not so much, but the backdrops in the world are beautiful.  The starting area when you begin is up in the clouds, I got lost in the scenary right from the start.","November 15, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","6"

Fusion system at first sounds like huge pain since i got overwhelmed with so much info , i spent alot of time just reading about it on web so i can ace it, which sadly was just a huge waste of time since you will only need to deal with fusion for the last boss and you only need dragon slaying capabilitys combined with seraphs respective element to roflstom him into the ground, on the other hand if you like to waste alot of time to make uber gear which might take you few days to make just so you can kill him several seconds sooner have fun with that. I was hyped about fusion , i figured there would be alot of optional super hard bosses that could be only wasted by creating special set of gear for each of tham but sadly no. My second playthrugh combat tactic was instant cast fire armatized hidden arts spamage.( right click, right click , right click so yea BORING)\n\nGood stuff: skits , music, normins trying to hump seraphs leg, failed cooking comments, watching ai geting killed over and over again if you can find some fun in that as i did.\n\nI got two games for the price of 1 so back than this wasnt such a bad deal i guess .

I'd have loved to have got further to give the story a chance, but it was all too much for me to handle.","December 4, 2015","false","1.7"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","1","11","2","0"

Tales of Symphonia left me feeling so good about the series that I have been ever so eager to play this game. Upon release the hype for the game carried over into the awesome graphics (in comparison) and battle mechanics. I was feeling the plot, mainly from the hype, up until the second half of the game. It just became lackluster. A lot of the plot to me became really underwhelming. The reasoning and just philosphy of their entire mission was just unfulfilling. In comparison to the Tales of Symphonia, the plot was short and just plain.\n\nIf you want to play another "story rich" game, go for it. It's alright and what you would expect from a better than normal jrpg, but if you are looking for something at all like Tales of Symphonia, be prepared for a lackluster game.","October 29, 2015","false","119.1"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"
