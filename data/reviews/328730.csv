"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/328730/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Letter Quest Grimm’s Journey is a casual, turn-based RPG word game with light RPG elements. It’s very similar to the Bookworm games from PopCap Games, but is harder and also has more content in it. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the better game between the two, but let’s dig deeper and find out, shall we ?\n\nYou start the game by ‘controlling’ a grim reaper named Grimm. You don’t actually control him directly; the game automatically moves the character forward if necessary. Later on you can unlock and control another grim reaper, a girl named Rose. Both characters use separate stats, so it’s not just another design. They actually impact gameplay.\nThe game works with levels, and each level has additional, separate/optional challenges that can be completed. There are 40 levels in total; technically 160 if you count all of the challenges, of course.\n\nSmall tutorials (tips & hints might be a better description, though) are gradually introduced during gameplay. Most things speak for themselves, but there are a few things that are important. There are levels where you have to use a certain amount of letters (or avoid using a specific amount), use letters in corners, start words with a vowel, et cetera. These challenges are usually used in challenge levels and in boss levels. Normally you can just create the words that you want, as long as you have the letters for it. But these have to be in English, which might be a bit tricky for international users who hardly speak the language. Don’t worry though, you can play the game just fine by creating smaller and easier words; it’s just that it might take you a little longer. That’s right, there’s no time limit. Since it’s turn-based there’s no need to rush (unless it’s a challenge). You can take your time, but once you submit your word you’ll be immediately attacked by your opponent.\nWord tiles will also change from time to time; there are poison tiles that will poison you (really !) if you use it in a word, and there are duplicator tiles that you duplicate certain letters (really !). There are even more of them, but I can’t remember them all, especially with my terrible memory.\n\nThere are books that can be unlocked that might give you more health, or do more damage, but these have to be bought from the store with crystals. Crystals can be found by defeating enemies, opening chests and getting to the end of a level. Earning these takes a lot of time and you’ll be frequently doing challenges and replaying levels in order to earn more of them. But you can also complete challenges. There are 70 in total and each one that you complete grants you 200 crystals.\n\nMore stuff can be bought from the store; there are weapons with different stats (one that heals you a little for each word that you submit or one that does more damage), and these can usually also be upgraded. You can also buy potions, better gear and books to improve your skills in combat, which is almost a must, because the game gets incredibly hard fast. But even failing levels will upgrade your equipped books so, again, you will still be able to beat them, it will just take a tad longer.\nStill, it could have used a little more fine-tuning in this area, because I can’t count the amount of times that I had to replay a level, or had to do a(n earlier) challenge in order to be able to buy something better from the store.\nIt’s always wise to take a potion (or two) with you but it’s even wiser to not use it if you’re playing a new level for the first time.  I’ve also spent a ton of crystals on potions that were eventually just wasted because the difficulty ramped up halfway through a level. It’s unfortunately very unbalanced sometimes and that will no doubt impact people’s experiences. The game relies heavily on using items and upgrading your gear, which makes sense, but for a casual game it doesn’t seem to be all that casual on that front.\n\nFor a two-man company the game is extremely well polished. But it isn’t hard to see that some aspects didn’t get the same treatment as some of the other parts of the game. I’m talking about the animations and the difficulty spikes here (which I already shortly addressed in the previous paragraph and won’t get into any further).\nThe graphics all look sharp and detailed, and everything is nicely animated, except for the enemies. The enemies just stand still and when they attack you might see a flash or something but except for that nothing else is moving. I understand it would’ve taken more time to animate all of the characters but it’s slightly disappointing and certainly noticeable, especially when the rest of the game feels so polished.\nThankfully the user interface is clean and user friendly. There’s also keyboard support so that you don’t have to click on of the letters you want to use. A simple idea, but really clever and I’m sure many people will appreciate it.\nThe music itself is retro themed, and up-tempo. I didn’t really enjoy it just because of that, but that’s personal and I wouldn’t ever say that it’s bad. It’s just not my style. I did find the sounds good with selected tiles making noises, and a sound that can be heard whenever a word can be submitted.\n\nThe description of the game states that it will take at least 6 hours to finish the game and I personally think you can at least add several hours extra to that number. I think 10 hours, give or take, would be a good estimate to do most of the things. For a word game, that’s pretty lengthy and, even more important, worth the money.\n\nLetter Quest Grimm’s Journey is a game that I very much enjoyed. There are plenty of word games out there, but nothing like this one or Bookworm Adventures. This is also one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. This genre hasn’t been oversaturated yet. Sure, it isn’t as popular as RPGs or FPSs, but that doesn’t make it any less fun. Who knew playing with words could be fun ? (well,… I did)\n\n[Rating: 76/100]\n\nSmall note: if you enjoy word games give Typing Of The Dead a try, too (that is, if you’ve never heard of it). It’s just as much fun and deserves more recognition and attention.","November 20, 2014","true","6.6"," 73 of 82 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","73","82","0","4"

Not only that, but the cherry on the icing on the cake on the plate is that the wordplay is nestled neatly in the trappings of an RPG, like a Jimmy Dean sausage patty in a light fluffy croissant.\n\nThe ability to equip gear, raise your stats, and even drink potions all contribute to the RPG feel, while various special and less than special types of letter tiles force more strategic play than simply 'what's the longest word I can find'.  If that isn't enough, each level has challenge modes such as time limited, or words must be longer than your arm, or you can only win if you live in Iowa.  Letter Quest is a pretty cool game is what I'm saying here.  Think about trying it.\n\nI'm Otter Chaos, and I approve this message.","November 20, 2014","true","21.9"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","39","48","10","3"

It boasts 40 different levels each providing 4 different challenges for the player (giving you a grand total of 160 challenges). If that's not enough for you, the expert mode unlocks once you've completed the game on the regular one. The RPG elements allows you to customize your character and allow for a natural progression since the challenges become tougher as the game progresses.\n\nNot being a native English speaker, I consider the game the provide a decent challenge while not pushing me away. It actually has that "just one more" quality that will have you engulf many hours in it without really noticing. A real word aficionado might find the regular mode on the easy side but will certainly enjoy the more challenging expert mode. It took me about 10 hours to complete the main quest and roughly 75% of the overall challenges. Depending on your level of vocabulary, you can probably complete the whole thing (including achievements) on normal in 10 to 15 hours.\n\nOverall a really enjoyable game that's easy to pick up and play for a quick session or to really dive into for hours at a time. I suggest you give the demo a try even if you're not usually a fan of word games.","November 21, 2014","true","39.4"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","0"

There's a good amount of playable levels and you can expect to sink about 20 hours into it (which is great for the asking price). One thing I quite like about the game is the mild challenge it provides by having special conditions on the crystal levels. You won't just be relying on the same words over and over again since you'll be asked to spell palindromes, use corner letters, use a minimum of 5 letters per word, and a lot more. Right now they just need to add more definitions from various sources but other than that the game is quite good. I would definitely recommend it especially since the price is quite reasonable.","December 6, 2014","true","19.0"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","1"

IM SO CRAZY about it in all seriousness I love it I want to buy the soundtrack\nEDIT\nOMG The dev replied and apparently the soundtrack is in the game's folder included with the game itself, thats so awesome thanks guys : D\n\nThe monsters, level and all designs are totally adorable and the animations are outstanding.\nThere are a lot of achievements to grind on, And a lot of levels and you can play every level 4 times so yeah that can give you more time to play, I am pretty sure I have around 4+ hours in the game than it shows here but they're all offline mostly and steam does not record that.\n\nTHIS might interest many people out there, there is no timer when you're typing the word or thinking it so you can take as much time as you want no need to hurry up and mess up.\n\nA lot of monsters to fight, some with special conditions   EX : only takes damage from words with 2 vowels or more. And moooore that makes the challenge even more crazier than it is.\n\nSo summing it all up\n\nPROS\n1 - Great game, awesome artwork and music.\n2 - A lot of levels that are replay-able, great designs on all of them.\n3 - A lot of monsters to fight, countless words to spell and special letters.\n4 - Kill monsters and finish levels to get crystals to buy upgrades and weapons and more from the store.\n5 - Quests to finish as you carry on and you can upgrade yourself and spellbooks.\n6 - Up to 40 levels, And after finishing the game you can start new game with expert mode that adds new stuff.\nCONS\nAbsolutely nothing. I am being 100% honest here, in all my reviews even when I fall in love with the game there's always cons but not this one, There's a good reason why this game has 100% positive reviews, the devs ... you guys did an outstanding job and my goal is to be one day as good as you guys are in game developing\n\nTL;DR\n- This game is 100% worth it for anyone who likes word games or slightly interested in them, Its tough and takes a lot of time to finish, Has a lot of content, achievements, leaderboards and cards so you cant go wrong, The 7.99$ price is so unfair for this amazing game\n\nA must buy if you're even slightly into this genre.","May 5, 2015","true","6.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","23","28","3","8"

Are you on the hunt for another and different RPG?\nThen Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey might be for you!\nDeveloper: Bacon Bandit Games\nPublisher: Digerati Distribution\nRelease Date: 20 November, 2014\n\nLetter Quest: Grimm’s Journey is a different kind of RPG which I happened to enjoy greatly.\nSo what’s the deal?\nWell you combine random organized letters which appear on your screen and use those to from words like Minotaur and depending on how many letters you used you deal some damage to the evil creature which dares to stand in your way. Some might take one or two words and others take literally a dozen and you might crush under their bulkiness. One can not always be victorious.\n\nIf you beat a stage you’ll notice that you only gained one star. Those stars aren’t your rating on how well you’ve done but just an indication that you’ve beaten this level of the stage. Every stage has four level and the last one is a so called Crystal Star level. I doubt I have to tell you that those are actually very hard.\nEvery Stage has the same levels. Level one requires you to defeat all monsters, level two is a time trial while level three is a special challenge and well level four is an ultra tough crystal star challenge.\nSo there’s enough for you to do.\n\nOnce you progress through the game you’ll encounter various figures on your way to slay all evil!... with the help of words of course.\nAnyway. Those figures will aid you in your battle against the vile creatures of evil!\nWell for some gems. Nothing in this world is free. Sadly.\nWhether you’re in the need for some more health points or you want a bigger and therefore stronger scythe, they have exactly what you want.\n\nBesides the obvious health points, armor and weapon upgrades you can also buy certain Books which will give you specific bonuses. One let’s you deal 20% more damage with double letter words like Bubble or Battle. Monster drop 8% more gems with another book. You can also upgrade those books. For every evil creature that you spell to death your current book gains experience points. Sweet ain’t it?\n\nMoreover you can also go ahead and buy a health potion so you can take a beating for some longer.\n\nQuests? I read RPG. So there better be Quests!\nWhat would any RPG be without Quests? Well no RPG … I guess.\nLetters Quest has a ton of Quests for you. With every Quest you complete you gain a certain amount of gems which you’ll need to upgrade yourself or buy some potions.\nQuests require you to do certain things like take 200 damage or use broken tiles twice.\n\nThere’s just one thing bugging me … The game’s only playable in english.\nSo if you’re not fluid with the English Language then I’m afraid you either have to have a Dictionary besides you while playing or you better brush up your English skills.\n\nWell if you’re either a native speaker or rather fluent in English I’d say this game is really worth your time. It’s fun, addictive and can be quite frustrating at times. You’ll feel the pain once you look at the random Letters on your screen and you can’t come up with a specific word in order to kill a ghost which takes only damage from 6-Letter words.\n\nEven if you’re not too fluent in english this game could also be a good exercise to brush up your English. Especially since the loading screen gives you some hints on what to spell with the letter Q for example. Like Qua.\n\nSo that’s pretty much it.\nGo ahead and use the random Letters on your screen to spell words in order to slay those vile creatures! I’ve said pretty much all that I wanted to say at this point.\n\nIf you happen to be a spelling bee …\n... then this game is definitely something for you. I greatly enjoyed the game and despite its rather cute looks it can be rather challenging at times.\nDespite all that I highly recommend it. Especially for you spelling bees out there.","May 28, 2015","true","1.6"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","28","37","3","2"

It’s not so much that the games are bad, but more that you’re taking a game that’s normally for non-gamers and trying to pitch it to the dedicated gaming crowd. Games like Cut the Rope and Angry Birds aren’t typically well-regarded by the people who constantly browse Steam for indie gems or AAA behemoths. So Bacon Bandit’s Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey has its odds up against it as a mobile-turned-PC game. With words as your weapon of choice, it looks as casual as can be, but Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey is more than meets the eye.\nLetter Quest: Grimm’s Journey follows the comical adventure of young reaper Grimm who is simply out to make cash and eat pizza. Along the way, he enlists the support of young female reaper Rose, and the two are out to collect treasure and defeat dastardly ghouls around their ghostly realm. A simple story? Absolutely, but it’s boosted by a great amount of visual charm. Grimm and Rose are downright adorable and their victory poses are sure to make you crack a smile. The presentation in general drips with cartoony appeal, from the various enemy designs to the witty descriptions of each monster. The sound design is chock full of catchy themes, and while some tracks tend to overstay their welcome, they’ll keep you entertaining with their upbeat, almost retro-inspired melodies.\nGrimm and Rose’s main weapons are not swords or spells, but letters. Yes, Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey is a word game. Using the letters on screen, players must spell out words to earn points and deliver damage to enemies. Taking cues from classic word games like Scrabble and Boggle, the longer the word or the more uncommon the letters used, the better the damage dealt. Defeat enemies to get treasure, which can be spent on power-ups or upgrades. This all sounds incredibly focused on a more casual gaming audience, but Letter Quest is relentlessly addictive.\nLetter Quest: Grimm’s Journey does throw some curveballs into the mix as well. Different enemies can cause various effects with their attacks, like poisoning your letter tiles so using them causes damage to you or flipping them upside-down to make it more difficult to spell words under time limits. Some of these power-ups are great, but there are just too many of these effects. Some are pointless, others feel like copies of others. Still, Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey likes switching things up when you least expect it, keeping you on your toes at all times.\nAnd it’s not a short game either. There is a ton of content in Letter Quest: Grimm’s Journey. Each stage has a basic challenge to earn a Star, but finishing that challenge offers new missions to earn more Stars for the stage. Some missions require you to complete the stage within a certain period of time, meaning you better be fast on the word-building. Others throw alternate conditions like increased enemy health or require you to spell words of a certain length or beginning with a certain letter. The last challenge is the Crystal Star, a super-hard challenge that could require some external grinding for proper preparation.\nLetter Quest: Grimm's Journey is fun, challenging, and charming, all things that make for a great word game. This is a journey well worth taking for fans of word games.","July 25, 2015","true","10.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

A 15-letter word bank with less RNG smoothing than BA creates a slight bit more difficulty inherently, and the game pulls no punches, expecting large words and smart item-purchasing decisions from the very start.\n\nOne downside compared to Bookworm Adventures is that specialized / bonus tiles are given at random, with gear and passives to improve your chances, as opposed to being rewarded for creating high-length or high-value words. The game also seems to favor a grindy approach to building up your resources, as the gem flow in the early-to-mid game is a bit unstable, and the potion costs are exorbitant. A larger variety of chest minigames would not have gone unappreciated, for that matter.\n\nUpsides include a MUCH larger array of modifications, gear, and enhancement items, as well as a more robust dictionary. There are some sly references here and there, and a very good stable of achievements and challenges.\n\nMusic tracks are regrettably short, and sound effects have punch but unique ones are few and far between. The end result is audio that can become somewhat grating after a straight hour or so of play.\n\nAll in all, it's an extremely solid and welcome addition to the genre, but not without its flaws. I'd recommend it over any other game like it that I have played, however, despite those issues.","November 21, 2014","true","3.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","2"

Essentially, you're a grim reaper-looking dude who's on a quest to get pizza - a much more relatable story than many other games I can think of. On the way, he has to fight monsters, such as ghosts, snakes and giant rabbits - just like going to the corner pizza place in real life. You defeat monsters by spelling words on a Boggle-like board, doing more damage for longer words or words with less common letters. Then you earn points that you can use to buy upgrades.\nThe game does get a tad repetitive after a while, but it's a fun thing to play for a little while here and there. My only serious complaint is that the game is a mobile port - not a problem in itself, but there are a few cases here and there where it really shows, with instructions to "tap" a button, for example - just little things not exactly meaningful when you're playing on a PC instead of a tablet or some such.","December 13, 2014","true","12.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The protagonists in the game has different base stats that determine evasion, hp, critical chance, and more. These affect the battles in significant ways and are able to be upgraded in the in-game shop. There are also hangman sections where you guess the word to get the treasure in the chest and merchant sections that allow you to buy items in between battles. It's been quite the bug-free experience too.\n\nThe game recognizes a fair amount of words. You can spell slurs, but the game will not recognize them unless they have a non-vulgar definition. Every now and then, an odd definition might pop up (definitions are provided for your perusal after spelling and submitting a word).\n\nThis game favors people that are familiar with English. For non-native speakers, I suggest using some aids due to a possible "grindy" nature the game can take on if you can't spell 4-8 letter words regularly. Keep the "ings" and "eds" in mind for increasing word length like winged and winging or touched and touching.\n\nThe art style is clean, clear, crisp, and cute. And maybe another c word. Clover? Anyway, some of the special tile sets that you can use vary in their readability. I like the default one and the transparent style. The Word With Friends style made my eyes water when trying to decipher the font. I suppose I'll never play Words With Friends.\n\nI had a good amount of fun with this title as I do enjoy words. If you like spelling and enjoy Scrabble (this is a single player game with some leaderboards, I believe), then feel free to pick it up. You'll get hours of enjoyment and challenge for a fair price. If you ever see this game on sale, then you can definitely pick it up without doubts.\n\nP.S.\nIt's far superior to its mobile version. It's always a wonder to see triple A ports that can't even support proper resolutions.","December 8, 2014","true","8.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You can use health position, upgrade your health.. word damage.. armor, get books that have buffs ect ect... There is a lot to upgrade here, which you need to get 4 stars on even the first level. The upgrades are not that impressive, its all do x% more that or this.\n\nDo not be fooled by the art style, this game is hard! .. i mean really hard!\nMaking words seem easy. But it is really not that easy to get good words that do a lot of damage. A variety of negative letter tiles makes it even more challenging, but also keeps it interesting. There are also buffs in the letter tiles that make it a bit easier, if you use those letters. You also need some luck in getting the right letters.\nThe hangman mini games are really hard... i got just 1 and only by guessing and it was "trillium" i never heard of that, apparently a name of a flower... k\n\nI probably find it so hard because english is not my mother tongue. Yes it is only in english which is a shame. I guess it could improve your english somewhat because it does give you the definition of the word you played, but then again you already knew that word because you played it. Unless you randomly put in letters and hope for the best... which i found myself doing for time to time.\n\nI has time challenges, boss "fights", hangman mini games which keeps the game from getting repetitive, but it still can become repetitive. I think this game is best played in short bursts... which makes sense because its a mobile port(a very well done one though). It looks like they forgot or didn't bother to animate the enemies! Grimm has excellent animations, your enemies have none at all..\nIt could use a local VS game where you battle a friend with words in a turn based game of letter quest, a missed opportunity.\n\nAll in all this game makes a word game fun and interesting and it gets a thumbs up from me for doing that.\n\n+Music\n+Art style\n+Unique game concept(i never seen anything like it anyway)\n+Challenging\n+Well done port\n\n\n-Enemies have no attack animation!?\n-Can get repetitive\n-Sharing anonymous data on by default\n-Only has the english dictionary\n","February 26, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Of the two recent titles that resemble Bookworm Adventures (the other being Words for Evil), this is the more RPG of the pair. It's turn-based, so you can take your time in assembling words and figure out what to do.\n\nThat said, while it's not a bad game, I found myself enjoying it less and less as the game went on and it began adding in more and more conditions to the enemies, or the "challenge" stages that consisted of nothing but "enemies have 2x HP". This is a game that expects you to replay earlier levels for more currency to unlock new items every once in a while, and maybe return to them to unlock new paths on "Hard Stages". If you just play the "required" levels, the game actually ends quite early, and there's a bonus world at the end which is sort of an HP sponge slog.\n\nI will also admit I dislike this game's dictionary - it feels incredibly limited, which is ill-suited for a game wherein you need to create words it recognizes as such to play. I know I'm being negative here, but I'm just pointing out that this is not my jam and maybe look at that other title I mentioned if it doesn't click for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BajiNaji/recommended/328730/","BajiNaji","Spiral","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BajiNaji/","244 products in account","A cute game that is best described as a light RPG using mechanics from popular word games.\n\nProgress through zones and defeat monsters using a Scrabble type system of creating words from letter jumbles, enjoyable if you like the idea of a single player Scrabble and taking your time. Additional challenges are condition based such as time limits or letter limit caps which serves to increase variety and challenge difficulty.\n\nThe role playing aspects are fairly light. Clearing a zone or additional challenges in each zone yield gems which are used to purchase both cosmetic and equipment upgrades, increasing your stats or limited use buffs. Chests that may appear in each zone are solved using a system analogous to the popular word game Hangman.\n\nOverall the art style is cute and well designed, and serves as a strong word based puzzle game. Grinding might be an issue for some as some challenges are gated by equipment and your stats. A great addition is the inclusion of word definitions after playing a word, though at present some definitions need some tidying up, something the developers seem keen to do. I can certainly see the potential for this to be used as a useful educational tool after tightening the definitions, but it is equably just as enjoyable as a casual game for those that enjoy word puzzles and word challenges.\n\n\n","November 24, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Certain letters are worth more damage, corresponding to their point values in Scrabble actually.\n\nBattles give you gems which allow you to upgrade various aspects of your character (more damage, more life from potions or more specific things like 40% extra damage from words containing double letters), and it's quite a nice little system. Earning plenty of gems and upgrading your character will make the game a lot easier, but at no point totally break it to the point of being too easy.\n\nThe "story" goes through a grand total of 40 stages as you follow Grimm's titular Journey to get a pizza. It's utterly forgettable, but cute enough I guess. Do not expect to play this for the story though. Each of the 40 stages has a normal mode, the first star, a time trial mode where you have to be fast, the second star, a challenge mode where enemies have special traits (like not taking damage from 4 letter words). Getting all three stars in a stage unlocks the hard version, which has stronger enemies and another set of special rules (like not having 'A's in there).\n\nAll in all there's plenty to do, and the core gameplay is fun enough to last you through it.\nIt's not the most innovative or deep game in the world, but I'd still recommend it.","May 27, 2015","true","9.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Happily Letter Quest has found a winning formula. A combination of humor and tried and true RPG-lite mechanics incentivise and distract from the fact that you're essentially doing primary school English homework.\nThe aesthetic is decidedly cartoon-ish and crafted with a younger audience in mind but it shouldn't be off-putting to older players. The story is silly, lighthearted, and sparse but is punched up by the amusing and word-play filled enemy descriptions. Finally the sound track is fun and energetic but it only plays one track per level so the looping can get in your head a little if you spend more than a couple minutes on a given level. If you enjoy them though you're in luck as the soundtrack is included with the base game.\nSpeaking of school work and a younger audience, it was nice to see the developers not pass up the educational opportunity inherent to this genre. Every time you type a valid word you can choose to see the definition and it displays the definitions of every word you actually use. At first this seems pretty useless, for the most part you'll only be typing words you already know, but it's actually a clever bit of forethought by the developers. As anyone who regularly plays word games or does crosswords can tell you, it's very easy to "cheat" at a game like this and use program to come up with the best words given your letter set. By displaying the definitions of all the submitted words it almost makes using an assist like that actually more educational than just typing words you already know. What I'm saying is expand your vocabulary by embracing the urge to cheat.\nAs far as the RPG mechanics go they've definitely been paired down for both general simplicity and with the intended audience in mind. You can upgrade several aspects of your character (damage, armor, health), apply various passive buffs that are upgraded though an XP system, unlock weapons, buy potions, and even unlock more characters. Another interesting mechanic is the weaknesses that the bosses have. Things like multiplied damage from double letter words or words with both an E and a S, force you to really think about your word selection. Several of the enemies also will restrict your letter choices by poisoning tiles, locking them down for a few turns, or even changing several after every attack. It's a fairly unique mechanic that helps keep what could be very repetitive battles fresh.\nOverall, Letter Quest is very well made, especially for a two man team, and can be enjoyed by most any player but will especially be of interest to fans of the spelling genre and those looking for a light educational experience. It doesn't take terribly long to complete the main levels, 4+ hours, but the inclusion of some hard levels, special objectives to complete on each level, and a number of unlocks definitely make the non-sale price point fair.","June 4, 2015","true","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're a gamer (casual or overall) and love scrabble or boggle [anyone remember that game?], you will LOVE this game.

You play as Grim (or 2 other characters that you have to unlock) and have to spell words to beat a variety of monsters. The more monsters you beat, the more gems you earn. Gems are used to buy different upgrades, books (kind of like spells), and potions. The RPG element adds a little extra oomph to this word game, which makes it shine.\n\nOf course, I love word games, so I played all 160 levels. Each level accomplished earns you a star. There's a little story line (displayed in comics), but the focus is on the word game and fighting of the monsters.\n\nI truly believe that this game is great for all ages.

It has the same basic build-words-to-attack mechanic as Bookworm Adventures, but I still feel that that title was more accessible and enjoyable.\n\nThe protagonist Grimm here feels quite weak in the beginning, and a few levels into the game the difficulty spikes, requiring upgrades to be purchased to progress further. This is unfortunate, as I feel the game could have added a number of extra quests without much effort to give a feel of constant progress.  Instead it felt like I was constantly retreading old ground on a grind quest to earn gems. This is where it becomes quite obvious that the title was a mobile port (gems = in-app purchases).\n\nAlso, as the difficulty increases, the special debuff/damage tiles begin to clutter the board early on.  That gets a bit frustrating to deal with, especially with the quantity thrown onto the board in one turn.  I do believe their presence helps make the game a bit more dynamic, but this could have been tweaked a bit, along with the aforementioned difficulty spike.\n\nDespite those concerns, I still feel the game is easily worth a few bucks and is a good casual game to pass the time. It seems the developers have been cool about updating the game and listening to customer concerns, so that is a plus.\n\nOne thing I'd personally suggest to the developers is to fix the fiddly way that the 'Help' button needs to be pressed to find out what a special tile is, or what the current quest is, or stats and other info.  This is where 'tooltips' would be useful.  Hovering the mouse over an item for a second or two could display relevant information somewhere on the screen.  Also, easier navigation with the keyboard would be welcome.\n\nOther than those concerns, I feel this is a pretty nice effort overall.\n\nP.S. The music may get on your nerves after a few loops, so do yourself a favor and lower/mute it in the Options menu!","June 22, 2015","true","20.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I've never been able to properly engage in a game of Scrabble, I love the gameplay that this particular genre of game affords.\n\nWhen I first heard of Letter Quest they were trying to get onto Steam via Greenlight. After much deliberation I picked up a copy of this game via the Humble Store. I fell in love with it instantly.\n\nI didn't have much time to play through this game though, so after playing a while put it aside and waited for Valve to greenlight this. It sure took Valve an inexplicably long wait, but here are the fruits of two men's (and a lot of Greenlight voters') hard work!\n\nAs the store page states, it's a combination of Scrabble and RPG. It's a very light-hearted tale of a very hungry Grimm reaper looking for pizza and battling monsters along the way - the story is told through rather whimsical-looking comic strip scenes. Yew spell wards een awder too keel anemees...sorry. Proper words, I mean. None of the words in that terrible sentence (barring the proper homophones) would work. :P\n\nThroughout the level you get gems for killing monsters and finishing levels (breaking gem piles). This is where the RPG aspect comes into play - kill more enemies, finish more levels, and you can use the gems to better upgrade Grimm's books, attributes, etc. in order for him to better survive the trickier stages.\n\nNearly everything about this game is just perfect. Perfect cartoony visuals. Take a bow, Jake Macher! Perfect soundtrack. Can't find out who did it, but the chiptune style soundtrack, which you can find in your game files, is gorgeous and fits the game - one of the rare times where it works SO well. Finally, perfect gameplay mechanics. Okay, nearly perfect. While the difficulty scales reasonably well, some of the monsters are rather tough to kill unless you can come up with words that are longer than 4-5 letters consistently!\n\nOtherwise, CTO Mark Smith has done an incredibly solid job on the coding front. It's rare nowadays for a game to be released on day one with no discernibly game-breaking bugs, and for this game to do so despite being coded by practically one person is a monumental achievement. Integration with Steam features like leaderboards, achievements and even Cloud save are also huge pluses. Not to mention that he (at least I presume it's him) is very active in the Steam forums responding to all sorts of questions, bug reports and suggestions regarding the game, and also pushes out updates as well. Rarely do you ever find developers with this kind of enthusiasm and candour.\n\nThis game can stand its own against Bookworm Adventures and the ilk, with its own unique brand of wit and charm. Give yourself a pat on the back, Bacon Bandit Games. You guys deserve it.\n\nWhen to buy: The game's been bundled a few times recently. The remastered version has recently been released - you can now buy both the remastered and old version in one package! I'd still recommend a pick up at any price point.\n\n9.5/10\n\nLike indie games? Want to see how some games play before deciding whether to buy them? Like game giveaways?

For pizza.\n\nAs if a whole horde of monsters guarding pizzas wasn't odd enough, I could have just dialed for a pizza delivery instead of questing for a slice of pizza at the end of the day. Putting that aside, now for the very long game review.\n\n__________________________\n\nWhat's there to say when it's basically a word game? As long as you have a good vocabulary you're good to go... but not quite. Throw in the idea of RPGs, and you'll need not only your wits, but strength to overcome this arduous journey. The game itself is like scrabble, but it isn't a crossword puzzle. Consider it boggle, but you don't have to link the letters in a line to form the word. That's freedom, and I like the idea of it. Given a set of 15 letters, you try to form words 3-letters or more.\n\nYou think that forming longer words makes you smart and powerful, but I say "That's rubbish." On your quest for pizza, you will find yourself facing some 'smarter' monsters that can only understand certain words you throw at them. If you had the brains but know not how to use it, you will definitely find yourself dead, no matter how much time you spent investing in forming a long word. Naturally, long words do more damage, but would they always? No. Some 'wittier' monsters can only understand baby talk, so insulting them with witty words proves no help in your quest. But I'm sure you are smarter than these monsters guarding pizzas.\n\nBy RPG elements inclusion, it isn't you being a hero and saving the day since you're just out hunting for pizza using your trustworthy guide.

Think Bookworm Deluxe with RPG elements, essentially.\n\nIt helpfully gives you a description of the word you just typed out too, though some oddities were spotted. Didn’t look ‘em up though, so for all we know, they might be right.\n\nThe sound work is decent, the graphics are good (and adorable), and the gameplay does what it has to, and even teaches you stuff. Definitely recommended!\n\nKouen & Lasharus rate this game 8/10\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=357886518","December 18, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That said I think this game is amazing.\n\nYou spell words to fight monsters so that you can earn gems to level up so that you can spell more words and fight stronger monsters. The game is playable in short bursts or long sessions. The challenges are varied so that even there are 40 levels each with 4 stages it never feels like a grind. The story is almost non existent but the humor and aesthetic are very enjoyable.\n\nLetter Quest is very fun to play and I've enjoyed it immensely.

For pizza.\n\nAs if a whole horde of monsters guarding pizzas wasn't odd enough, I could have just dialed for a pizza delivery instead of questing for a slice of pizza at the end of the day. Putting that aside, now for the very long game review.\n\n__________________________\n\nWhat's there to say when it's basically a word game? As long as you have a good vocabulary you're good to go... but not quite. Throw in the idea of RPGs, and you'll need not only your wits, but strength to overcome this arduous journey. The game itself is like scrabble, but it isn't a crossword puzzle. Consider it boggle, but you don't have to link the letters in a line to form the word. That's freedom, and I like the idea of it. Given a set of 15 letters, you try to form words 3-letters or more.\n\nYou think that forming longer words makes you smart and powerful, but I say "That's rubbish." On your quest for pizza, you will find yourself facing some 'smarter' monsters that can only understand certain words you throw at them. If you had the brains but know not how to use it, you will definitely find yourself dead, no matter how much time you spent investing in forming a long word. Naturally, long words do more damage, but would they always? No. Some 'wittier' monsters can only understand baby talk, so insulting them with witty words proves no help in your quest. But I'm sure you are smarter than these monsters guarding pizzas.\n\nBy RPG elements inclusion, it isn't you being a hero and saving the day since you're just out hunting for pizza using your trustworthy guide. You equip yourself with books that actually aid you in your journey which automatically writes new experience for itself as you battle your way to the delicacy. You upgrade your stats to aid you in your long battle. You find a new girlfriend and you decide to let her battle for you in the frontline while you take the pizza for yourself.

Your job is to come along for the ride and use some fancy words to get your way out of difficult situations. Better the vocabulary, better the chance of you winning and sometimes it really isn't as easy as it looks.\n\nHonestly, at first glance it looks like a bit of a childish game due to the animation and bulky look of menus, playable blocks and just the general idea that follows this, but it's honestly perfect for all ages as a casual puzzler to lay back with and get yourself really thinking to try and get passed certain levels.\n\nI enjoy that the difficulty is set in the middle somewhere - Not punishing, and not dead easy. It's pesky in mini-boss fights as well as certain levels (Also hard levels), while not being impossible to get through. It makes winning feel rewarding and for a game to get that right, it has a lot of brownie points from me from the get-go.\n\nGraphics: Cute, smoothly animated, nicely cartoony, all round really nice.\n\nSoundtrack: Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the soundtrack to the levels, menu etc. However, it does tend to grate a bit after a decent amount of play time as there isn't enough variations to how it sounds. I found myself turning the music down if not nearly completely off after the 3 hour mark hit as that was my limit.\n\nMenu: Isn't really much of one, but for what there is of it; it's nicely set-up, easy and simple enough for anyone of any age to navigate around.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Wonderful little blend of RPG and a family favorite (e.g Scrabble/Boggle/etc), It blends together really nicely for a game that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. It keeps you thinking, possibly even teaches you new words you had no idea even existed while feeling both engaging and rewarding.\n\nBrain teasers and adorable-ness, how much of a better combo can you get out of a relaxing puzzler?\n\n","January 29","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Whilst the story is almost non-existant, the gameplay is thoroughly satisfying and somewhat addictive, in a way that a lot of casual games tend to be.\n\nYou proceed through mulitple stages, coming up against differing enemiesand bosses in a turn based combat system, where your attacks are determined by the words you can create from a random set of letter tiles; essentially Scrabble. Spelling longer and rarer words rewards you with higher damage. RPG elements are thrown in, in the form of upgrades to your character and their abilities, such as increased damage, resistances, critical hit chance, and so on. There are also unlockable weapons, and two further characters with slight attribute differences.\n\nThe premise of the game is excellent, though I feel it lacks a little depth at times. I would love to see the RPG elements of the game expanded upon if there was to be a sequel; maybe having a party of characters; being able to cast status effects rather than just attacks all of the time; less linear progression, etc. There is certainly a lot of potential here.\n\nUltimately, if you were expecting an RPG like experience, you will probably be disappointed by this title. If you enjoy word puzzle games however, this game is a pleasant change and has an interesting core mechanic that will keep you playing for hours.","July 4, 2015","true","19.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","3"

Longer words and rarer letters make for more damage, and you go back and forth until either you or the enemy falls over. Simple enough. I'm a big fan of that genre (what few games exist for it, anyway), but unfortunately, this game doesn't really do the genre justice.\n\nThis game is a lot easier than Bookworm Adventures or Word Realms, though. For one, you have a massive hand of tiles (20 at once!), so it's not at all hard to spell words. Second, enemies rarely do anything especially bad to you—they do sometimes mess with your tiles, but none of the things they do to you are particularly problematic. You can purchase all kinds of numerical upgrades (increased health, increased damage, etc.); some of the challenge missions basically aren't possible until you do this, but that's more due to strange enemy design than due to actual challenge. Also, letters don't have specific point values, but instead are just ranked into three tiers. This makes it easy to spell words that score decently high, but it also means that there isn't much reward for using really obscure letters.\n\nOnce you beat a level, you'll have to go back over it three more times, with different rules each time. There's a time trial, which is exactly what it sounds like. There's a challenge level, which either beefs up the enemies or puts restrictions on what kinds of letters you can use. And there's a "crystal star" level, which is where the real gameplay happens; in crystal star levels, different enemies have different attributes that actually affect what words you can or should use against them (one might take extra damage from words beginning with a vowel, and one might be only damaged by words that involve letters from the corner of your grid). Crystal star levels are actually fun, since the different monsters feel different and are more than just blocks of tofu for you to spell words at. (Outside of the crystal star levels, the monsters feel very, very similar—they might do slightly different attacks to you, but they don't feel differentiated from each other at all.)\n\nAs far as presentation goes, the game feels half-♥♥♥♥♥. The music is awful, the graphics are boring (the monsters are all basically recolors of the same five or six sprites, and they aren't even animated), and while you're not playing this game for a gripping plot, even the paper-thin story is lackluster. This game lives and dies on the gameplay (which isn't really a bad thing, since the gameplay is the most important part of any game, but still), since it doesn't really do anything to make itself pretty.\n\nOverall, this game's only real strength is the price. If you're looking for a word-combat game that actually feels well-made, you're better off playing Word Realms. If you've already beaten Word Realms and Bookworm Adventures and just want something else in the genre, this game will keep you amused for a couple hours, but it won't reinvent your world in any sense. I don't regret the few dollars I spent on it, but neither am I clamoring for a sequel, at least not without some kind of assurance that said sequel would have a lot of improvements to it.","June 21, 2015","false","8.9"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

The setting is cute, the art is cute, but besides that it's not very interesting. It's also somewhat punishing where I think when you die you have to restart the level and early on (or the entire game) there's no reliable method of healing. If you really want a game based around using spelling/words as a puzzle just go buy Words of Evil. It's over half the price of this game and better in every aspect.","May 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 2 of 26 people (8%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","8","2","26","0","0"

There are character upgrades, weapon upgrades, multiple weapons, all the currency is in-game, you can grind if you really want to but probably don't need to, there are special conditions that affect the letters you choose to give them a little bonus (crystals) or a detriment (like whirlwinds, reversal, cloners, etc.), and each of the 40 levels has four variations on how to play it. It's fun, challenging but doable, and just...a damn fine game. I'm ridiculously picky most of the time, and this game is seriously good stuff for the price.

The longer the word/more valuable the letters used (think Scrabble rules, where using 'Z's, 'X's, etc. nets you more points than 'E's), the more damage done to the monsters.  As you defeat monsters and beat levels, you earn gems, which you can then use to purchase various upgrades.\n\nEach level has four "stars" you can earn: the first is simply for defeating all the monsters on a level, the second is typically a time trial, the third is a unique challenge condition to beat the level, and the fourth is a much harder version of the level.  This adds some replay value, as do the achievements.\n\nThe story is almost non-existent, but that's not really the point of playing something like this, so it never bothered me.  Graphics are serviceable, and I did not encounter any bugs.\n\nAll in all, fun little word game.

The difficulty of game highly depends on your vocabulary.\n\nOther than the word-spelling part, the mechanism of which is traditional, the game incorporates some RPG elements, such as you battle through various scenes to defeat enemies with different abilities to modify the letter board, you are given quests involving spelling during battles, you can buy upgrades to improve your hero's performances and you can level-up your books to receive bonus under specified circumstances. All these elements and factors are integrated into the game smoothly so that the word-spelling puzzles become very attractive and addictive. Although grinding may be needed at some point, this game is not hard overall. 15-20 hours are needed in order to complete all the stages, achievements and buy all upgrades in the store.\n\nThis one is much better than any other word-spelling games on the market, and it might be great game if the producer could bring in more contents (e.g. an intriguing story, NPCs, more weapons, items, foes, etc.).","April 7, 2015","true","18.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I knew that there needed to be greater challenges, more powers, more wordcrafting and more stats. Grimm's Journey a firm addition to that genre and delivers on all of the above.\n\nPROS: This game takes most of the core elements that made Bookworm Adventures great and expounds on them.\n\nThere is a lot of content: Each individual level has 3 more challenges to add both depth and varied game play. So each"level" is really 4 as you attempt to collect all 4 stars. The first star is always a standard play-through, the second is usually a time challenge, the third is a run-through where each monster has special restrictions or weaknesses, and the fourth is hard mode where the monsters are high-powered. This provides a decent amount of extra playtime and provides more choices on what type of game play you are feeling during any session.\n\nStats are awesome: The game stats that are tracked are comprehensive. Max damage with and without bonuses, palindromes spelled, the number of times you have used each letter, how many times have you spelled bacon...that is just a few. The list of tracked data is huge and is lots of fun to look over.\n\nCONS:  I really wish there were still even more powers. The "books" that you can equip can help both form a strategy or just generally make your character more powerful. I feel like more options in this category should have focused more on that strategy element\n\nIt is difficult to craft a strategic run during a given level because they are mostly short (2-5 enemies) and a decent number of enemies have powers that can change tiles or prevent you from using certain tiles. In bookworm adventures 1 you could carefully spell short words using left over letters as you purposefully work toward collecting the necessary letters to spell "Nonproliferation". A mode or "book" that protects your tiles from alteration or lockdown would go a long way toward empowering the overly calculating player.\n\nOVERALL:  This is an awesome game that exands the niche RPG, word-game genre. This game is worth every penny and has been a great addition to my "regularly played" game collection.","November 27, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You spell words based on random letters (ie, like Bookworm) and deal damage to monsters based on the complexity of your words. You earn gems over time that will let you deal more damage, take less damage, or other miscellaneous effects. There is a story, but it is frankly not very good (Grimm is looking for a pizza...).\n\nNormally I am quite critical of free mobile games being ported to PC with a big price bump. Thankfully Letter Quest is very well done and is worth the price. The mobile version is free, but supported with lots of IAP - the PC version is balanced so that you can play normally and get enough gems normally to afford to upgrades that you need. Plus you can directly type in words and such, so in many ways I feel that the PC version is going to be superior for input purposes.\n\nThe developers, who are still active (~9 months after the launch of the game), actually support the game and make it quite fun. The game is going to be a challenge for those who don't have a big vocabulary, but if you play enough the power-ups will help you out a lot. I actually learned a bunch of new words by trial and error and I like that it shows the definition for most words that you can spell (apparently the game dictionary is ~190,000 words).\n\nThe graphics are repeated a lot but are vibrant and cute. If there is any constructive feedback I can give, it is maybe that a easy mode can be added for kids. Once you are through the first dozen or two stages you really need to be spelling 5-6+ letter words or you are going to be spending forever grinding for potions.\n\nIn all a great find and I hope the developers make some other cool games in the future.","June 8, 2015","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a Scrabble junkie who has run out of opponents (no one wants to play me anymore for some reason...), this scratches the Scrabble itch. It also has charming graphics and tolerable music. There are a few issues, but don't let them dissuade you from buying it, as they really are not game-breaking. First, it occasionally "runs into an error" and has to close. Since everything seems to auto-save constantly, this isn't a big problem. Second, I disagree with some definitions and/or word inclusion. But it's a big language out there, after all. Third, it's a bit grindy. Now, that complaint really only applies if you look at it from a "speed thru and never look back" perspective. If, like me, you want an eternal Scrabble board, it isn't going to matter. Just don't expect to beat the game without some standard RPG resource grinding.\nIn summary, it's worth every penny.

I love that it gives you a modern dictionary. Most word games still use old definitions and don't allow more modern words. Great game","January 28","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Although the Remastered version is the exact same story, it really doesn't cut down on the enjoyment of either as long as you truly enjoy these kinds of games. Otherwise, a good reason to play them both is because they have separate achievements and trading cards.\n\nBuy it at full price, it's worth it.","February 4","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hadn't used ♥♥♥ before, and though it would be a really cool way to try it out. This game was one of the 10 that I got.\n\nI really like this game. It's everything word games used to be before 'in-app purchases'. It's ballanced very well, you never really feel like your over your head. You feel challanged, not frustrated. That's really rare for a lot of games like this these days.\n\nThe game itself runs very smoothly, it's extremely well optimized. It's like a whole can of WD-40, no stuttering and no real loading screens. Most games aren't this optimized these days, even games like this one typically have the occasional stutter or tear. None of that here, pure butter smoothness. I'm not playing on a gaming PC ether, i have an i3 with an IGP.\n\nThis game is one of those rare ones, and I really have no idea why more people don't know about it. It's pretty sweet, and I usually don't like this kind of game.","May 7","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
