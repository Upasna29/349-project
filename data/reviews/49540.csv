Once, on Christmas Day 1989, I eagerly ran downstairs and gasped at the sight of what was clearly a crudely but lovingly wrapped skateboard. A skateboard that I had wanted ever since I had seen Marty McFly cruise through the streets of Hill Valley as a stowaway behind an unsuspecting SUV driver. A skateboard with a custom deck, with artwork that would cause my fellow skaters to shout "rad". A skateboard whose wheels would send me gliding across the streets as I headed for the nearest half-pipe. A skateboard of majestical proportion.\n\nI grabbed it, and with shaking hands and a heart beating against my chest, I tore that festive wrapping as hard as I could. Through an intricate web of sticky tape, ribbon and ever expanding wrapping paper, I dug through. Years later, I wondered that this is what Andy in The Shawshank Rdemption must have felt like as he dragged hinself through the tunnels. My own redemption was in sight. My prize was near. Finally, the last shred of packaging fell away to the floor. And there it was... a plastic skateboard from the local store. With stiff plastic wheels. And a picture of a clown on the deck.\n\nThat's what playing Aliens: Colonial Marines felt like.","June 13, 2014","false","10.8"," 3,757 of 4,072 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","757","4","6","135"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/recommended/49540/","Azundris","Azundris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/","247 products in account","MORALS AND IDEALS\n\nAs most of you know, this game was basically announced as an AAA game with next gen graphics, and ended up a (at the time) bug-ridden B-list game with last gen graphics. Many people were understandably upset about this, especially those who pre-ordered. If you don't wish to do business with a company that found itself in a lawsuit claiming false advertising, more power to you for your ideals.\n\nTHE GAME\n\nI played this in Jan 2015 after some massive patches, and after the game was on sale for $5. At this point, I experienced the game as practically bug-free, except for the astonishing fact that the game still won't let you go: When I quit the game, it is immediately restarted (wrong exit code or something?). Restarting Steam too helps, but it's a bit ridiculous. On the upside: no game-breaking or fun-killing bugs while I played.\n\nSTORY MODE\n\nThe game is pretty straight forward in that there are no optional side-missions, and the level design is such that in campaign mode, it is extremely rare that there is more than one way to get from A to B. Gameplay-wise, it's a squad shooter in that your avatar is hardly ever alone, yet you cannot give orders to non-player squadmates. The campaign is open to 1-4 players, but incomprehensibly, players can't configure their avatar; they're assigned a premade one even though only one of them appears in cut scenes or has any dialog. The loadout however is still configurable.\n\nVERSUS\n\nTwo teams of 1-5 players each can face off in various aliens vs marines modes; for this, you can configure the look and loadout of your avatar (including male/female - there's also a Movie Characters DLC with 4 chars none of which is female. Maybe Ripley was too expensive to license, but where's my Vasquez??).\n\nCHALLENGES\n\nApart from Steam Achievements (some of which are for the sole story DLC, Stasis Interrupted), ACM features challenges. Proceeding in the story or meeting challenges results in more customization options (some purely cosmetic, others ways to make the various guns more powerful, though squads with players on different levels seem unproblematic).\n\nThese suffer from having a required order -- you won't get credit for a challenge that isn't up yet. Also, there are challenges that require other players outside the "Versus" challenge category, implying that as a single player, you can't even finish the "General" category. Meh.\nYou'll revisit a lot of the story for the Challenges/Collectibles, but since you can only jump to Chapters but not savepoints within them, you'll waste a lot of time getting to the scene you need.\n\nTHE GRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are serviceable. The texture resolution could be a little bit higher, but then, it could always be a little bit higher. Considering that this is after a 4 GB patch that included better textures, I'm scared to imagine what the game may have looked like at release. Now however, it does its job; as long as you don't expect Alien: Isolation, you might be satisfied; just keep in mind that this is Dead Island to Isolation's Dying Light. There are some enbseries presets for this game that amplify bloom and color grade in favor of blues, as you would expect from an '80s movie -- especially Aliens. (Apparently, one preset even adds a "VHS look".) I find this to slightly improve the graphics, but only so much -- nothing like the drastic results I had with presets for e.g. Fallout New Vegas etc; it may or may not be your thing.\n\nTHE SET\n\nWe meet pretty much everything you'd want from an Aliens game in ACM: loaders, dropships, the Sulaco, various types of alien including the queen, and hey, you get the shoot the pulse rifle. (I'm easily satisfied that way.) You also get to deploy auto-guns, use the smartgun, etc. You get to shoot aliens in Hadley's Hope on LV-426, in the space jockey ship, on the Sulaco, and various other beloved sets. You pay for this with some inconsistencies -- some understandable and even welcome  (for you to frolic in Hadley's Hope, they had to downgrade its destruction level from vaporized to condemned); some incomprehensible (the dropship and consequently the APC look subtly, but noticeably too narrow, and so does the Sulaco's hangar). I remember Aliens very, very fondly (while at the same time not being enough of a fanatic to notice that e.g. the individual crewmembers' cryo-sleep booths on the Sulaco weren't in the same order as in the film, or that someone's locker opened to the wrong side), so for me, the set alone was worth the price of admission. (The engineer's ship is a bit boring, but then, we never really saw much except for the space jockey and the eggs in Alien, either. It's big and empty, and I guess it's supposed to be.)\n\nTHE STORY\n\nThe story isn't outright horrible, and it ticks the expected boxes (some people get "impregnated", some people get cocooned, lots of people and lots of aliens die; the marines are good, the company is bad, and the usual gear is used etc.), but it is hardly material for a movie that might stand alongside Aliens. The main plot motivates a lot of shooting, and traversal from one set piece to the next, but does little for me beyond that; the story ends very suddenly, giving away what might have been an emotionally satisfactory coda; and it can be a little non-obvious in the heat of battle which of the identical twin ships your captain is on at any given moment. It's not horrible, but it could have been so much more. It could, arguably, also have been longer, with the main campaign clocking in at less than 10 hours.\nSome plot points are cleared up in the prequel DLC "Stasis, interrupted", thus continuing the worrying trend where you have to pay extra for closure as it's no longer part of the main game (cf. "Broken Steel" for "Fallout 3", Tina's DLC for Borderlands 2).\n\nVERDICT\n\nSo, is it justified?\n\nAs an excuse to revisit beloved sets, it certainly is. As an excuse to do much shooting with fun guns, it is, too. As plot and production values go, it is a wasted opportunity, though in all fairness not on the level of Alien^3 which instead of taking us to earth, or the home planet of the aliens, or that of the engineers, gave us the stakes of the lives of few dozen ugly killers and rapists, and then didn't let us root for the alien because the SFX looked so pitiful.\n\nWhile I'm normally a "strictly co-op" girl, some of the vs maps and modes were surprisingly fun. Due to the lack of maps, you'll need DLC quickly: Bug Hunt is a fun new mode with 3 maps and a friendly community.\nIf you're an online player, factor BH into your budget; it's where the game shines. If you're strictly single-player, get Stasis Interrupted instead, to beef up the very short story mode of the main game.\n\nIf you want to shoot fun guns in familiar, beloved sets and you can get the game on sale, ACM should be fun for a few hours -- as long as you don't expect a AAA title with brilliant writing and next-gen graphics, which I'm sure nobody does after the massive backlash. It's definitely a can-have, but no must-have. In the end, it's down to whether you believe that after the massive backlash and financial losses, the industry got the point that all the foul play of the early days wasn't on, or whether you believe we still need to make a point. In the former case, you may want to curb your expectations and give it a go; in the latter, you'll be right to give it a pass.\n\nSteam forces me to tick yes or no, so I'll go with "no", by a whisker, simply because while I had fun, it falls short of its announcement, there could have been more multi-player maps, more/better plots and graphics, etc. -- the patched version is never horrible, it's actually fun enough, but it's also noticeably lacking, just a bit, but in every category. "No" to lack of closure, "no" the charade around its publication, "no" because of what could've been, and now likely won't ever come to pass, or at least not for a very long time.","February 2, 2015","false","220.4"," 615 of 667 people (92%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","92","615","667","18","37"

Absolutely terrible.   If you were a fan of the Movie, you could get alot out of it just for the nerd-out factor of being on-set, but other than that the gameplay was like a bad COD rip-off, the aliens were NOT scary or hard, and the WY Mercs were frustratingly good at soaking up bullets. The graphics were occasionaly pause-and-look-worthy but most of it was a letdown.\n\nI have now been modding the game for 2 months and I am up to version 4 of my mod at this time.\nI've fixed alot of the graphical issues with how the game was configured, removed Console related restrictions, and set things to match todays computers (this is an Unreal game). I've also spent time with some of the cooler set-pieces to make them even cooler.\nI have reworked the Xenomorph AI to be fast, smart, sneaky and deadly, the Merc AI to be less robot like and more vulnerable and the Ally AI better at combat and positioning.\nWeapons have all been reworked to feel like real world weapons and more varied and powerful.\nHow you move, and how the first person view functions has been changed to give a better sense of motion and urgency, the HUD no longer shifts around the screen moving your cross-hair, and you can turn the whole HUD off.\n\nYou get the Smart-Gun about 5 times now. That alone makes the game heaps better!\n\nIf you are a fan of Aliens and see this on sale, buy it, install my mod and enjoy a fantastic Aliens experience","March 23","true","189.9"," 268 of 292 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","268","292","9","31"

You'll walk the halls of the U.S.S Sulaco, you will land at Hadley's Hope, you will explore Operations and in the end you will even visit the Engineer ship where the franchise began.\n\nEach area is pretty much a giant easter egg filled with tiny easter eggs.  You'll stumble over the spent sentry guns from the Aliens director's cut, one still containing 10 rounds.  You'll find the room where Burke, Carter J. met his cowardly end.  The medical bay where Ripley and Newt were attacked by face-huggers is here as well, with overturned beds and bullet-shattered glass.  While crawling through the sewers you can even find the head of Newt's doll that we last saw floating sadly on the water.\n\nThat said, a lot of plausibility of those easter eggs was sacrificed in the name of coolness.  Sure, it's cool to pick up Hicks' shotgun but why is "No Fate" carved into it?  Sure I get it, same actor but why would Dwayne Hicks scratch that on his darling for close encounters?\n\nAs far as the gameplay itself goes, it is clunky but passable.  You will either overlook it because you like Aliens that much or you will turn the game off after 5 minutes.  Or perhaps you will do both - I myself played for 5 minutes before putting it down for a year.  When I played it again I beat it all the way through just out of curiosity.  Found myself slightly entertained though, I admit, more by the settings and the little things than the actual story.\n\nOn that note, the story - if you have played an Aliens game or watched an Aliens movie than you know the story already.  Weyland-Utani are bad guys, they want the alien and will stop at nothing to do their experiments.  Nothing new here.\n\nThis is basically a game for fans of Aliens who can also overlook the disrespect towards that very movie's canon, shown over and over again via easter eggs.  If you fit the bill than I recommend this title to you!","December 1, 2014","true","16.3"," 535 of 645 people (83%) found this review helpful 102 people found this review funny","83","535","645","102","18"

Are you one of the many gamers that eagerly awaited the release of this game since it's announcement in 2004? If yes to the above, prepare to be severely disappointed.\nAliens: Colonial Marines is a first person shooter that acts as a sequel to the 1986 sci-fi classic, Aliens. The game follows a USCM Marine named Winter, along with his utterly boring and unmemorable companions. The plot has Winter and the Marines of the USS Sephora returning to LV426 to investigate the disappearance of Ripley and her companions from the original film.\nThe story of this game is a senseless mess, and at times, makes no sense whatsoever. A character that was explained dead in the film makes an appearance in this game ( his magical reappearance isn't explained at all by the way) and ridiculous events will occur to keep the game moving at Michael Bay pace. None of the characters are remotely likeable or memorable, and they certainly frustrated me to the point of turning the game off. All of these problems could have been fixed if more attention had been paid to the writing process of this game. Or the whole game for that matter.\nThe gameplay doesn't fare much better than the writing of this game. Most of the guns feel like airsoft equivalents, and the shooting in question feels tedious and lacks tension. The enemy AI is woefully poor, and most of the time you'll face off against human enemies rather than the xenomorphs themselves. The level design is boring and linear, and all the indoor locations feel like the same grey corridor you went through just a few moments ago. The outside levels impress you at first, until you realise they are just as linear and restricting as the indoor ones.\nThis game's only saving grace is its multiplayer mode. There are a variety of game modes, many of which are creative and innovative for the FPS genre; but although these are alot of fun, they're let down somewhat by the overall poor gameplay mechanics. It's a shame this doesn't provide the quality that'd easily help it compete with the likes of Natural Selection 2.\nAs an Aliens fan, I am very disappointed. Save your money eveyone, there's an awesome Alien game coming out in 2014 called Alien: Isolation. Save your money. 4 / 10.\n","January 23, 2014","false","50.6"," 308 of 357 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","308","357","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/49540/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","This one really hurts.\n\nAs a lifelong fan of the Alien franchise, I've had to put up with some terrible uses of the license. The first film I watched was Alien 3. I willingly paid money for the Playstation version of Alien: Resurrection. I've gone through the janky platformer/shoot-em-up versions of Aliens on the earliest consoles. I even suffered through Prometheus.\n\nYet, for all that, there was one game I was absolutely convinced would be quality - Aliens: Colonial Marines. On the surface, it seemed like such a sure-win proposition - Gearbox Software helming an FPS that pays tribute to all the militaristic aspects of the Alien universe, wrapped up in the kind of quality they're known for. You can't miss with that, right?\n\nWhat a shame, then, that the final product is such a mishmash of ideas. I know about the accounts of development - the multiple developers all having a hand in it, the half-baked storyline that was rewritten continuously through production, the lies and disingenuous marketing - but for all that, is there any good to be found in the game?\n\nColonial Marines puts you into the (combat) boots of Cpl. Christopher Winter, an everyman protagonist who is part of the crew of the Sephora, a combat warship that is dispatched to intercept the USS Sulaco after receiving a distress call from Cpl. Dwayne Hicks, one of the survivors of Aliens. Sent into the Sulaco to rendezvous with other members of the Sephora Marines, Winter not only discovers another xenomorph infestation, but also the influence of Weyland-Yutani, who are working to breed a queen for their own needs.\n\nHonestly, that's all the plot you need to know, because the following ten levels are an intermittent battle against the xenomorphs coupled with Call of Duty-lite shooting galleries against W-Y mercs in settings from the film. There was a lot of potential here - fighting through the bowels of the Sulaco (in locations that were built from production notes and sketches), going back to the now bombed-out Hadley's Hope colony - but it's all wasted via terrible AI, weak story hooks, weak graphics, etc.\n\nThis truly looks like a game that could have been made in the late 90's - and it shows. All the worst vices of FPS games from that era are on full display here: armor pickups that inexplicably restore it, even if you pick up seven chestpieces in a row; a weird hybrid between "only being able to carry a limited amount of weapons" and "every weapon is on you at the same time anyway"; enemies that make a beeline towards you and act like morons in melee combat; enemies that have health pickups explode like a pinata out of their body when they die, etc, etc.\n\nThe characters aren't any better. Bella is already a dead (wo)man walking when you first see her, and you don't have any reason to give a s*** about her plight. O'Neil veers between being alternately whiny and arrogant, and his bored facial impressions do nothing to endear him to the player, even though he's your main squadmate for the majority of the game. Reid's only defining action is that she gets depressed after being saved when the xenomorphs try to cocoon her, and becomes a hollow stock character that pretends she's amazing for the rest of the story. Finally, there's...\n\n***SPOILERS AHEAD"""\n\nCorporal Hicks himself, who apparently returns from the dead. He's adopted a dour and sarcastic demeanor due to his experiences between the film and the game, but I can't tell if that's legitimate character development or just Michael Biehn's bored line delivery. He handwaves his apparent survival with a nonsensical explanation that it's a "much longer story", and even the explanation we do get in "Stasis Interrupted" is at odds with just about everything we saw in Alien 3.\n\n***SPOILERS END***\n\nThat's not to say it's all bad, though. Going through the various environments and finding audio logs, collectible weapons and Easter eggs is a treat, even if it's short-lived. There are a few moments that evoke a far better game, like the "Raven" level, where you're forced to stealth your way through boiler aliens that explode if you make too much noise, and some of the battles against the Queen. There's also patches that greatly increase the difficulty level, finally putting it up to the level of a modern shooter.\n\nFor all that, though, they still horribly squandered the license. The new alien types look like something that were ripped from the Kenner toyline, without any sense of originality or thought process (you can't tell me that a Alien faction multiplayer mode wouldn't have been better over the bog-standard gametypes we got). The use of voice actors from the film (including Mark Ralston, Al Matthews and Biehn) feels half-hearted and unappreciated. There's all these references to events from the film, but it's mired in mediocrity and/or so easy to miss that you don't care half the time. The lethargic and floaty animations (on both sides) take you out of the action and make you focus on the bugs, janky graphics and weak gunplay.\n\nIn the end, A:CM is a terrible use of the license, and is only worth picking up if you find it on sale. I only paid $2 for it during an Amazon sale, but I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy this game at full price.","April 14, 2014","false","24.3"," 289 of 352 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","289","352","0","4"

I've loved the alien franchise since i was 4 years old (26 now) so for me to say no on this hits home quite hard on this one. I shall explain why through pros, cons. and overall at the end.\n\nBefore i start, let me say this. I Recommend this game but only for the die hard alien franchise fans and people that love playing the role of a colonial marine and also only if you are prepared to see the worst 'official' canon to a franchise in history (Seriously, the storyline is that bad).\n\nNow, onto the Pros and Cons.\n\nPROS:\n1. It's in the alien universe. Between colonies being based on moons, exploration into space, and the fact that the alien is such a terrifying creature by nature it's fun to have a go at killing them. And your a Colonial Marine with a Pulse Rifle and array of weaponry. Cool!\n\n2. Revisiting places form the 2nd film is cool (Even though the blast would of cleared everywhere that the game is set.)\n\n3. The music and sounds are true to the film and do slightly absorb you into the atmosphere (Where there is any).\n\n4. The multiplayer (If you can find a game) is actually quite entertaining and fun. It's slightly more biased to the alien side in my opinion, however it is fun. It is truly the saving grace of this game.\n\n5. Stasis Interupted and Bug Hunt are actually quite good pieces of DLC. Although many argue Bug Hunt should of been part of the actual game and not DLC it's actually worth the price (Fans + New Game = Money money money)\n\n6. The Co-op Campaign is actually decent fun with friends/randoms.\n\n7. If your a massive aliens fan, you bare the game out (Pulse Rifles baby! lol). You go on the Sulaco, LV-42, the Derelict e.t.c. which is pretty neat.\n\nCONS:\n1. The storyline (from the viewpoint of a hardcore alien franchise view) is pitiful and pathetically executed at best. It's disgusting to think that gearbox could do what they did to the franchise.\n\n2. The gameplay is basic - it's a 'too linear' shooter which has nothing original or new to offer the aliens series or gamers in general.\n\n3.  The mulltiplayer died after 2 weeks of release. This was the games saving grace (As mentioned in pros) The only surviving Multiplayer is lingering among steam groups and they are only hosted here and there at best.\n\n4. Nothing like it's demo trailer. This has been said over and over again website to website forum to forum - but really when it was released and your expecting this kick-♥♥♥ segment and it turns into poo...come on gearbox.\n\n5. Graphically it looks good...if it was released in 2007. This really isn't a pro or con, but come on SEGA/gearbox, the hell!\n\n6. It's such a cop out to the franchise. The alien is surposed to be this creature of terrifying appearance and presence, yet you do not feel scared by it at all. I get it, it's a shooter, but...the alien...and also the different types of alien are so bland (Drone Spitter Lurker) - i mean come on, AYFKM (Are You F**ing Kidding Me) SEGA/Gearbox.\n\n7.Given it's development history, it's no surprise that the game was in shambles. Between going from one company to another company to another company not all the blame can be put on gearbox, just 90% of it.\n\n8. To this day, i still say that the lack of dedicated servers are what lead to the true demise for the multiplayer. People copped the lack of authentic weaponry for the marines, the lack of not feeling like the same alien no matter the class, but some dedicated servers guys!! They could of at least done this for us.\n\n9. Sweet lord, the AI is absolute rubbish. I mean it's Daikatana meets COD AI. It's just.....ugh. The AI in the 1999 AVP was better than this.\n\n10. If your like me, and paid full price on release day for this game, you felt jipped.\n\nOVERALL:\nIf you like/love the aliens franchise, you'll bare this game. It's worth $10, The DLC is great, the multiplayer is fun, but there are so many drawbakcs that it will halter the good time you have on it.\n\nP.S. - F*** you Gearbox.

But in the end what we got was another generic modern FPS. Aim-down-sights? Check. Fighting against generic humans? Check. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ regening-health? Somewhat check. Boring story? Check.\n\nThe gameplay is repetitive, boring, generic, and painful. Like shooting at bland enemies with weapons, that sound like ♥♥♥♥, in a bland level that offers so little in terms of design that in order to incentivize exploration the developers had to place pointless collectibles like dogtags, audio logs, and 'legendary weapons'?! (HA! Gorman's pistol and Frost's flamethrower are considered legendary weapons... like most people would even know who Frost is XD. Not to forget Gorman is far from anyones favourite Aliens character.) If you like any of this stupid ♥♥♥♥, you'll love CM. But I don't!\n\nThe AI in this game is garbage. Xenos just sprint in a straight line at you. Sound fun? Sound challenging? It isn't. Xenos'll even sometimes just stand in the middle of a room, staring at you, doing nothing. Great... not like the human enemies are much more challenging.\n\nYes, you heard me right. You trade shots behind bland cover with bland, generic, human soldiers. At least half of the game is spent fighting these guys. Instead of... well... you know... THE XENOMORPHS.\n\nThis game is way too easy. Did I die? Sure. But was it hard? No. Like I said before, the AI is stupid. Since the Aliens just run at you there is no challenge, just click on the bad guys a few time.\n\nYou may be asking: "What do you mean by '♥♥♥♥♥♥ regening-health? Somewhat check'?"\nWell... You have 3 health bars, and each health bar can regen, but it can't regen above it-self. So let's say you are at half-health (in the second bar), you will regen the second bar full, but you won't regen the third bar. You can pick up medkits to regen lost bars. This is the same system from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AvP3. And yes, it sucks ♥♥♥.\n\nSo how is the story?!\n♥♥♥♥.\n\nSo Colonial Marines takes place after Alien 3; and once again Weyland-Yutani are stupid (SHOCKING?! RIGHT?! It isn't like at this point in the series this must be like the fourth time they've failed at using the xenos... if we count Alien: Isolation of course). But I'll start from the beginning. So Hicks (voiced by Michael Biehn, who sounds as bored as ♥♥♥♥) sends a distress call after the events of Aliens. So then a bunch of marines from the USS Sephora or some ♥♥♥♥ like that (This story is so forgettable so bare with me I don't remember much) are sent to investigate. They find the Sulaco, over LV-426, and are sent over to the Sulaco. They find the cryotubes holding Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop, which are ejected. (Oh yeah I forgot to mention that the Sulaco went over to Fury-161 then the pods were ejected. Then the Sulaco went back to LV-426 because we have to go to LV-426... Yeah this game's story is just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid) So then of course (SHOCKINGLY) we find out the Sulaco is infested with Xenomorphs. I won't spoil anything but just know the game's story is painfully predictable and boring. (kinda like... Alien: Isolation)\n\nNow does this mean there isn't any good parts of this ♥♥♥♥-teir game? No. I do actually like the part where you go into the derelict from Alien (Even if you do fight humans in this part), The Egg cargo hold is huge (And Awesome!)! You also get to see the jockey! (Which I mean... we've seen a thousand times in AvPClassic and AvP2... but it's still cool). I also enjoyed the level where you get to explore Hadley's Hope (even if that makes no sense... because wasn't it blown up?).\n\nBut the negatives outweight the postives. The 3 dollars I bought this for, during a sale, wasn't even worth it. I haven't had the chance to play Multi-player yet, but I doubt it'll be anything special. The only game based off of Aliens I think is worse than this is AvP 2010.\n\nI can't even justify this game to hardcore fans of Alien(s). If you want a better FPS based off of Aliens pick up Aliens vs Predator Classic 2000 on Steam, not this generic modern-day garbage (or maybe even AvP2 if you can find a copy, just for the single-player though, the multi-player sucks in that game).\n\n♥♥♥♥ Aliens: Colonial Marines.\n\n-MandatoryAlcatraz","June 25, 2015","false","14.6"," 136 of 167 people (81%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","81","136","167","22","3"

If you´re not an ULTRA BADASS Alien Fan don´t waste time and the money for torturing yourself. I have to admit that in the beginning the game was fun. Really it was but the game has some technical issues.\n\nI don´t wanna talk about the graphical issues we all know about. Sometimes the level design is scarier than the Xenos themnself. The Weyland mercs are just a pain in the ♥♥♥!!! I don´t mind fighting against Xenos all the time, even if they look always the same that is what Aliens the movie was about. There were no mercs that look like a cheap copy of Half-Life2 Combines... Some levels are so long and boring just the achievements kept me moving on. Yeah the game features achievements lots of them some are quite easy to "achieve" some are insanely hard to get.\n\nThe sound is quite good and sometimes the sounds down in the sewers are quite frightning. The Aliens in the sewers by the way are just a bad joke. They walk with a limp - that´s weird. I like how they crawl along the ceiling and the floor but you better not turn your flashlight on down in the sewers - this part of the game is just a joke and not funny at all.\n\nThe voice acting from the main characters is quite cool - Bishop sounds best IMHO. Steam shows me a play time of about 18 hours I haven´t checked the time before I started my playthrough but I think it must have been about 6 to 7 hours I needed.\n\nIn the end I have to say that I will not reccommend the game due to the many flaws I encountered during the playthrough.\n\nThanks for reading!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/49540/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Out of curiosity to see how bad this really is, I got it for $5, played it, & have now lost a lot of respect for Gearbox. It is easily one of the worst games I have ever played. I see why it got bad reviews and it deserves every one. This is a unacceptable tragedy. If it were given another name and marketed as a low priced generic shooter, it would still be sickening. My advice, forget about this even if it goes f2p and play the Aliens vs Predator game from 2010 which is decent, around a 6.5/10. This game was $50 or more when it was released back in Feb 2014, and now as of August 2014, only six months later, it is only $15 and you can find it constantly on sale for only $5. That is how horrible this game is. It is the prom night dumpster baby of Aliens games.\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥ this game is something else. It would be a decent game with some fun shooter elements if it weren't one of the buggiest, most poorly coded, generic games of all time. Example of its incredibly poor design: fighting through a level in the dlc Stasis Interrupted, which despite some people saying that it is much better than the regular game, sucks equally as much as the normal game does, with no health packs, then when the next level loads, there are 4 health packs at the beginning which is completely pointless because it gives you full health at the start of a level and you don't even need them because you have to walk a ways to even see any enemies. What they did to this game is laughable and becomes more of a joke the longer you play. I have alt+tabbed out of the game to amend this review probably about thirty times, each time adding more and more bad things about the game, never once to add anything positive. It just gets worse and worse the more you play. One of the biggest flaws and one of the dumbest coding problems I have ever seen in any game in my life, and actually this is the only game I have ever seen do this since I started PC gaming back in 1997, is that when you close the game, it instantly relaunches all by itself... lol. The only way to close it is to alt+tab out, run task manager with ctrl+alt+del, and force close steam then force close aliens........ what a dumb sick joke. In-game is glitchy too. Achievements reset for no reason. I was near the end of a mission and had 3/5 melee kills for a achievement to get 5 in one mission, which is hard as fk since melee sucks bad and you can't get close to anything without dying quickly because only a couple of bullets or bites from a alien kills you, and I died and when it reloaded me at a previous checkpoint the achievement progress reset... So I got 3 melee kills again from the checkpoint, died, and they reset again...\n\nI am skipping every cutscene because not only do the character models have god awful movement like puppets and their mouths look like puppet mouths, and the voice acting is some of the worst of all time and the script is one of the worst of all time, the game is just so generally awful I just want to hurry up and finish. That and the cutscenes also perform horribly, very stuttery and jerky.\n\nFriendly AI in single player is broken. Sometimes they follow me to an objective, sometimes they don't. I know it is broken because many times I will be going to an objective alone and when I die and restart at the checkpoint, the marines will then come with me, basically letting me know that they should have came the first time but didn't because it is broken. Enemy AI is almost non-existent. They charge at you blindly or stand still and fire.\n\nThe game engine is very generic. It feels EXACTLY like the Blood 2 game engine which is very old and horrible. It is also only about 6 hours long (thank God) which is a 100% ripoff when it first came out, and even still at $5 since the game sucks balls and you will not find even one online game going at any time, ever. You need to go to video options first thing and turn the field of view option all the way up because anything less is way too low. The pulse rifle is gargantuan and takes up the entire bottom-right 1/4 of the screen, and then some, even on the highest field of view. That's right, changing the field of view does not change the weapon size lol. The pulse rifle takes up more of the screen than most giant rocket launchers do on some war games. You unlock all of the primary weapons quickly and they all suck nuts save for the pulse rifle and tactical shotgun. I bought the sawed-off double barreled shotgun extra for 99 cents and it is one of the worst weapons I have ever seen. It sounds like a BB gun when you fire it and while you are reloading it you get killed. You might unlock a few more later like maybe the flamethrower but who cares because the game sucks anyway. You die randomly and you die alot just because of how powerless you are to how extremely generic combat is and them flooding you with aliens. And the enemy AI is non-existent: they run straight at you with no thought or care in the world. The most laughable part of the game is when you die. The death animation on your guy is the worst I have ever seen. When you die it turns black and white, goes into third person, and shows you dying and the animation looks, every time, like a kid pulling the strings on a puppet flopping him around awkwardly. The Alien just gets in your face and gently swings his arm at you all prissy like "myeh!" then you die. Sometimes there isn't even a death animation; the screen just goes black and white and you are laying on the ground dead. And even when you have full armor and health, you can still die in a couple of hits from a alien. Dying in the game really only comes from trial and error. I have only ever died because of one single reason: being flooded with so many enemies to the point of not being able to reload fast enough to keep up then they get in close and I'm dead. On the second or third try though I get through it, but it is still the only reason you will die in this game. Zero skill is involved. You do NOT want to die because it will usually set you back pretty far and having to redo something in such a bad game is a cruel joke by the developers. It is a trend with all bad games: poor checkpointing. The checkpoint system is half broken as well: on mission 10 when you have to survive the attack of the queen, I died once and it put me back to the checkpoint, I died a second time and when it loaded it glitched me to the next checkpoint past the queen without having to beat her... I consider it a blessing. The way enemies gib is awful and looks very primitive and amateurish. The way they gib looks EXACTLY like Blood 2 and that is a game from 1998 and it blew hard. The sound and music are instantly forgettable. If you were listening to someone play and not watching, were it not for the sound of the pulse rifle and radar blip (when you press Q to hold up your radar, it isn't automatic like every other Alien game) you would never know it was an Alien game. Dead enemies sometimes get stuck in a doorway and start flipping out. I die constantly from the enemies just doing instant dmg whenever you are in view of them, instant massive dmg usually. One or two hits from any enemy wipes out the armor that you just scavenged for, and then your health drops very quickly as well. Ranged enemies with guns have pinpoint accuracy so your only hope is to run and dodge behind obstacles if there are any and close the gap to get close enough to hit them. Or stay back and snipe. Graphics suck bad, character animations suck bad, voice acting is God crap awful and their words don't match their mouths, effects are garbage, sounds are crap, and so on and so on. And when combat is this generic and dull it is very distracting.\n\nThe fact that 54% of all the steam reviews for this game are positive just shows that there are a ton of easily impressed people out there and that you can't ever, ever trust the review system. A long review was needed to give this the bashing it deserves. 3.5/10","October 13, 2014","false","16.3"," 139 of 203 people (68%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","68","139","203","13","0"

So to say I had high hopes would be an understatement. I love the Aliens films and had yet to find a good Aliens game unless there are also Predators involved that is. Unfortunately this game stayed true to form. The story mode is okay and you can play co-op but it is a game on rails (unlike Borderlands). There are upgrades you can earn for multiplayer deathmatch but most of the Aliens vs Marines games I played always ended up being one sided affairs with people just holding key points Zzzzzzzzzzz. Also the story doesn't really make sense (correct me if I'm wrong) when linked to the films. I think with a bit more thought and input from fans of the Aliens franchise this could have been vastly improved.

It spawned a 1986 sequel Aliens that gets regarded as one of the best sci-fi horror action movies of all time. Aliens: Colonial Marines is a first person action horror shooter that follows five new marines on Acheron (LV-426) after the Aliens movie. You'll take the roll of Winters fighting off both Xenomorph aliens and soldiers from Weyland Yutani ('the Company') as he goes from the spaceship Sulaco to the planetoid's surface, through Hadley's Hope and into the furthest reaches of the alien hive.\n\nThe sound design, music and voice acting are high points to the experience. Music that feel straight from the Aliens film if not late 70s space travel movies. You'll visit scenes straight out of the Aliens movie even if a lot of it was blew up before your arrival. The effects, lighting, fog, sounds and atmosphere blend together to put you in a place that fits the Aliens franchise. The blue planetoid, the white sterile walls of 'the Company,' exhaust in the narrow corridors aboard the space ship and even the fog layer over greenish black resin made by the aliens. Luckily the 'video feed filter' can get turned off so you can see the game without having a grainy fuzz like in the movie. In cut scenes the game doesn't have the video feed filter, so why should you?\n\nChained with you throughout the game are your allies. Sometimes none, sometimes one, and other times five of them. They'll do their best to kill enemies, but they're inefficient. Enemies will sometimes walk right by them and head straight for you. The best part about your allies is using them to distract enemy soldiers, so you can flank them. The game makes good use of flanking with cat and mouse maps. But not with the Xenomorphs, they're usually in hallways or out in the open with them running straight at you. Thankfully, your allies cannot die, since they're part of the story. When the enemies are dead, they'll always be ready to show you the way waiting at whatever door you're supposed to be at next. You can clip right through them, so they're never in the way.\n\nYou have three bars of health in the game. Each bar regenerates unless you've lost the bar completely. Then you need med kits that give you full health. Over that you have armor that doesn't regenerate. You just need to find more armor lying around or from dead soldiers. Heavy soldiers drop full armors, so its easy enough to find it and lose it. Its a good system.\n\nYou'll face off against a variety of different aliens. For the most part they'll climb on walls and ceilings. Then drop down and run at you or lunge a great distance. They can be deadly up close, but a shotgun blast takes them out. The rifles don't feel effective at all. There are acid spitters that stay away while spitting from a far. The lurkers are the intelligent ones. They'll use stealth to attack you. Climb through vents, disappear into the darkness and they take more damage. Then there are the Weyland Yutani soldiers. They can do everything you can do. Flank, hide, reload, shoot and throw a rare grenade your way. They drop random health, ammo and armor.\n\nThe bosses are big and need you to outsmart them than just taking more damage. You'll fight one in a power loader, you'll outrun one torching all the doors behind you. The bull alien will chase you in circles, letting your allies shoot him in the back. Finally the queen is the most meh battle of them all. So meh I literally could clip through her and speed run the final battle of the game, doing all that was needed of me.\n\nFor better or worse, the weapons are straight out of the Aliens movie. There is a variety of shotguns, pulse rifles, assault rifles, pistols, flame throwers and even the smart gun that tracks enemies to shoot. Throwable things like grenades are easily forgotten, because they need to be armed like a weapon and can't be quick thrown. To make throwables more forgettable is the fact that most weapons have alt fires. Assault rifles have incinerators, pulse rifles have grenade launchers and even those that don't can be upgraded later. There are a lot of upgrades for each weapon such as scopes, skins, alt fires, clips and so on. They unlock as you rank up from completing 'challenges.' These challenges are things like kill 20 enemies with any rifle. Get 5 melee kills in a single 'mission.' Headshot 5 enemies with the service pistol. They do switch things up, because otherwise I'd use a shotgun through the entire game. Damage > accuracy.\n\nBy the end of the game you'll have an entire arsenal, complete with weapons found from characters in the movie. Each weapon has its own ammo so if you run empty on one shotgun, the pump handle might still have some shells. Since you have so many weapons, the game makes use of a weapon wheel. Every weapon has its own stats: Damage, accuracy, rate of fire and so on. Shotguns have more damage, but less accuracy. Pulse rifles have less damage, but high rate of fire. The problem is the rate of fire is weak, you can't just hold it. The gunfire will stop, forcing you to play in controlled bursts. The assault rifle will only shoot two bullets at once. Weapons can get upgraded mostly to increase accuracy, clip size and reload.\n\nThe thing to most take into account is the accuracy stat. You need to aim to shoot with any accuracy. Not just that, because of the accuracy stat, you can shoot things head on and they have a chance of going straight through. To prove that, the game has DLC with a firing range. Aim straight on, fire and sometimes things just go through. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it might kill you. Speaking of killing you. There is acid blood, but its never enough to kill you, even standing in it on the highest difficulty. What will really kill you is aliens clipping through you. Becoming you so your gun is outside of them. When you fire it will miss, because the alien has clipped through you. Since they can run faster than you. It caused frequent deaths.\n\nIts not all guns though. There are a few brief moments where you need to use stealth. First unarmed you'll have to quietly sneak past a new form of blind aliens that explode. Then you'll have to sneak past lights and sentries that will spot and shoot at you.\n\nOther glitches have been fixed with some patch a year into the game, but even when they were patched I still noticed glitches that had been fixed were still a problem. Nothing game breaking, just noticeable. Things like an alien coming off a wall and getting stuck in the floor. Getting hit by an alien while shooting only to have the gun still shooting. Texture popin was still here and there, mostly when reloading a level from a death. I guess its a way to speed up load times.\n\nThe controls are simple for the most part. Aim, shoot, alt-fire, move, look, jump, squat and run. Use the D-pad for flashlight, grenade ready, weapon ready, pistol ready. There's a whole other button to switch between two weapons even if you can hold a dozen or so. Sometimes it didn't feel intuitive, but the game lets you bind keys and controls. While there is melee, it felt useless. Most things on soldier difficulty will easily kill you at close range. You also have a motion tracker, but it only feels useful when I was trying to find the location of the next checkpoint. Sure it tells you where enemy movement is, but when you can't use it and shoot it felt like a handicap. Plus, you hear a sound when you're in range of a new hostile.\n\nThere is multiplayer, but there's nothing going on at this point without being scheduled. Overall, it was a good experience, even if its not the best first person shooter. While people call it the worst game of all time, it could have been much worse. The end left me with a sour taste. At the end of Star Wars, they blew up the Death Star and that was that. They didn't start the next movie and end it.","November 27, 2014","false","22.7"," 72 of 102 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","72","102","5","1"

As a matter of fact, I even completed the game in short bursts, which is saying a lot if I look at the current state of my game library.\n\n\n\n"So, how is the game" - you ask sceptically?\n\n\n\nFirst, forgot all about what the other reviewers here wrote: this game has been patched up so much that nearly all bugs are gone. Team-mates will not block doors, aliens will not walk through you, you will not become stuck, there are no crashes, ... The guy who wrote you only get to operate to power loader exo-suit for 2 seconds obviously got not far into the game, as the suit returns for a boss battle halfway. Seriously, some reviews here - even recent ones! - look like they are talking about a completely different game.\n\n\n\nWhat remains is an OK first-person shooter set in the Alien universe. Its best aspects are:\n\nFairly good depiction of the colonial marines and the aliens. Marines operate in teams and that is exactly what you will be doing here.\n\nSounds are excellent, especially the weapon and door SFX that sound like they were taken straight from the movies.\n\nLots of fan-service: you will visit the movie-sets, find tons of easter eggs referring to the movies, music from the movies, ... Picking up the Smartgun had me giggling like a schoolgirl every time.\n\nGameplay is fluently and entertaining, even though very simplistic.\n\nIt is interesting to see how the game links "Aliens" with "Alien 3" and beyond.\n\n\nThen again, the game is by no means perfect:\n\nIt is annoying that almost all aliens zerg straight to you, often completely ignoring your team-mates.\n\nGraphics were outdated even on day of release.\n\nWhile some sets are epic, there are also lots of levels that are forgettable and just plain boring. I mean, how many times do we have to walk between near-identical ruined buildings or through caves?\n\nThe story is fairly rubbish and at some points hard to follow. The "Weyland Yutani is evil" card is being played far too much and becomes boring very fast.\n\nDifficulty is unbalanced: even the easiest difficulty still includes very high difficulty spikes.\n\n\nOne common complaint is that at some point, the alien enemies are replaced by human enemies. That is simply not true: it is correct that about halfway, human enemies are added to the game, but you will be battling aliens until the very end. The aliens also remain the biggest threat at all times, while the humans are mostly pushovers for anyone with even a tiny bit of FPS experience.\n\n\n\nAs to the DLC, most of it is garbage. I only care about the singleplayer part and found that all I needed was the base game + Statis Interrupted. The latter DLC starts of with a nice "Alien" vibe (seriously, it is a wonder that the makers of Alien: Isolation were not sued ...), before going back to the "Aliens" setting. Its FPS part is even more back-to-basic than the base game. If you prefer slightly more modern FPS gameplay and don't really care about the link between Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection, you can just as well skip Statis Interrupted.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I recommend the game to everyone who is even slightly fan of the Alien-universe AND who likes straightforward first-person shooters. No, it is not a horror game. And yes, it is an almost old-school FPS with health packs, point-and-shoot gameplay, secret hunting and not much else. But if that is what you are looking for, you will not be disappointed for 5$/€.\n\n\n\nHowever, if you want the ultimate Aliens-experience, I still recommend Aliens vs. Predator 2 over Aliens Colonial Marines any day of the week.\n","February 16, 2015","true","21.0"," 66 of 105 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","66","105","3","1"

Sadly I can't really recommend this game. I had low expectations for this game so I just wanted to go through the story. But even on the easiest level the game is quite tough and very frustrating. A single alien or grenade or head shot can kill you instantly. Although the game supports a controller, you simply can't react quickly enough to survive between checkpoints. I had to play with mouse and keyboard to get through the chapters.\n\nI had to replay some scenes again and again learning where the aliens or humans are going to jump out at you. It is like a survival horror game (limited health, ammo and armour) but with tons of enemies that need to be killed to progress. It is mostly a very linear corridor shooter with scripted monster closets. There are 11 missions, but they look and feel very similar.\n\nTo me it feels like there is not enough ammo for you to kill all the enemies. So I tend to hang back and watch the AI characters play the game, which is pretty boring. Even on easy the AI characters get killed again and again and again, but luckily they always get up again. My other problem with the game is that it rarely actually feels like the aliens universe. The only good things are the motion tracker, pulse rifle and ending cut scene. They have even invented new types of aliens which just feel very, very wrong. The graphics are OK but are very generic future sci-fi. This is totally at odds with the aliens films which have a very retro sci-fi appearance.\n\nI forced myself to finish the game, but basically I did not enjoy it at all. I kept hoping the next chapter would be better, but is never really was. I did try and play multiplayer but I never managed to get a match even though I tried lots of different settings. The DLC is a little bit better and more interesting.","February 1, 2015","false","20.9"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","28","39","2","1"

Kinda. It has some good aspects to it. I really liked the map design of the maps that takes place on LV-426, the maps that take place on the sulaco have some great parts but aren't really that statisfying, they've added a cool new alien called the Spitter, the other new aliens are sh!t (i'm kinda hard to statisfy when it comes to new alien designs) and the weapons are cool, the all of the traditional weapons are there including some new ones that actually aren't that bad, and the weapons used in the movie Aliens can be found as collectibles and I love them all except for Hudsons Pulse Rifle witch is a burst rifle for some reason but the weapon itself looks great. and the Pulse rifle finally sounds like a Pulse rifle, it might not sound like a big deal but to me it actually is. the graphics aren't that great but I don't really mind, I play games not graphics.\n\nBesides all the things i just mentioned there isn't much to write home about. the AI can be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, especialy the AI of the weyland yutani mercenairies, and thats another thing, there are way too many weyland yutani mercenairies. I know fighting other people isn't new to an Alien game, Alien Trilogy and Alien Ressurection had some human enemies in it and AVP 2 also had a level where you had to fight humans, but why so many. there are a few boss battles witch are really, really bad, the ending is terrible. and there's the story, witch has been approved by Fox (probably by some f*cker who couldn't see past the dollar signs in his eye), it's just terrible.\n\nSo what about coöp and multiplayer,\ni've heared a lot of people say games are much better when you can play them with your friends, but I liked A:CM more when I played on my own, multiplayer actually was really great, i really enjoyed playing multiplayer but unfortunately it took less than a month before the multiplayer was dead.\n\nunfortunatly the game wasn't quite what i expected, I kinda enjoyed playing through the campain once but once that is over there isn't really any fun in it, and the multiplayer was great but now it's dead, therefor I give Aliens: Colonial marines a 4,5/10","November 26, 2013","false","15.6"," 51 of 80 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","51","80","0","2"

I surley can understand why Xenomorph-Enthusiasts and people who bought into the Hype hate it. The pictures from the Storepage are more or less fake, the Alien-AI is except from some rare scripted behaviour poor and the Story is nothing to write home about. It feels like a game published from a low or medium-tier developer or something scrappy, unattractive standing for ten years in your shelf.\n\nBut if you can ignore all this and get it for a dicount(75%) than it´s worth the ten hours the campaign may take. It´s a fun mediocre shooter, best played in coop. You may forget everything about it afterwards but just running down a linear path, shooting at dumb Xenos and waves of corporate badguys is something of a guilty pleasure. Also it will give you some untold Alien-Storyline!\n\nIn short.. don´t expect too much.. 65/100","May 4","true","12.9"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","2"

We're talking "they barely fulfilled their legal obligations with the season pass DLC" bad. "We released story DLC as a final patch for the title and abandoned it forever" bad. "Game now reboots on an endless loop whenever you close it and Gearbox doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥" bad.\n\nThe gameplay's arguably worse. Ever wanted to be a marine who had to grind for weapons IN SINGLE-PLAYER? Seriously, though, you can't carry more than two guns until you start hunting for audio logs or other things to trigger XP gain. That is how bad this gets. It is also, and maybe this is my sucking at FPSes here, just hard in some mean ways. I'm pretty sure some enemies spawn out of midair in certain fights. Even using the motion tracker (hope you like juggling about 6 keys to do anything at a time, by the way) I'd be eviscerated when something was suddenly on top of me. Like, literally on top of me, it came off the roof or from the sky somehow.\n\nThere's much, much worse in here. Let's not get into how dumb the plot is, or stealth segments where you hide from blind xenomorphs (this is a real thing and the animation is SO BAD), or that the only things you will remember when the game ends are going to basically be "remember X from the movies? we did that but you're nowhere near as cool as Ripley".\n\nI made a bet with a friend that we'd start this at the same time and see who'd beat it first. She uninstalled it a few levels from the end and never regretted it for an instant: I was much, much stupider to finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Don't buy, don't play, do not even think about this game, because it's not even the funny sort of bad, it's the painful, needles in your eyes bad variety, where every level is like pulling teeth.

Having never played the original unmodded version I can only comment on the modded version I am now playing.\n\nI've been playing on "faster weaker soldier" mod mode and the game has proven an addictive and satisfying followup to Aliens. The modded Alien AI has proven a wicked challenge and really makes it feel like you're reliving the film. I haven't finished the title yet, but there are a fair amount of bugs left, and another complaint would be the balancing issues that are the result of ACM Overhaul's tweaks. You're sometimes left with too little health or ammo for a "Normal" difficulty setting. Some of the alien gameplay definitely needs to be tweaked for optimal playability but I hear things are improving constantly.\n\nThe story line is relatively straight forward and could have been executed better. The characters are pretty shallow, but this overall it doesn't detract from the game too much.\n\nI haven't put down the game since I've started playing and I recommend it to fans and non-fans alike with the ACM Overhaul mod installed. It looks like it's finally given this game the justice it deserved from a rushed release.

A few of the reviews are daring to say that this game didn't deserve all the negitive attention but trust me this game is f^cking awful. I'm a huge Alien fan and this thing should be nuked from Orbit!\n\nThe story is complete sh!t and destroys the Alien universe. I would say its like a bad fan-fiction but that would honestly be an offense to fan-fiction writers.\nThe gameplay makes Call of Duty look like a work of art.\nThe graphics have been patched up a lot but it still doesn't look good.\nSound design makes me want to tear my ears off.\nVoice acting is just terrible and they constantly repeat the same lines. "WINTER, MOVE!"\nAI is god awful and is not fun to play!\nI finished the game in 4 hours on normal!\nMultiplayer is dead, the only way to get a game is to join a group and gather people up at set times.\nMichael Biehn (Corporal Hicks) is 59 years old and not a voice actor so he sounds hilarious. Also his in-game model looks like a bad wax figure.\nYou spend most of the game fighting humans...\nWeapons look good and fit in the universe but they don't sound or feel good.\nDON'T BUY THIS","March 11","false","5.2"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","19","25","2","11"

Dont get me wrong, there are worse FPSs out there (like Day One) and the game has some enjoyable moments but the game itself is crap.

For everything it does right, it does atleast 3 more things wrong.\nThree examples:\nThe game makes you have to pull out your motion tracker to use it, rendering you unable to fire, but the motion tracker detects infront and behind of you, negating all tension as you don't need to co operate with your teammates at all.\n\nYou can customize your weapons, making them your own, but you can carry them all with you at any given time, (and even edit them in mid mission!), meaning there is no real strategising in customizing.\n\nUltimate badass difficulty attempts to give you more immersion and atmosphere, which it actually succeeds in doing. Ultimate badass difficulty removes all hud and makes the game more difficult, meaning you have to remember what you do (and don't) have. This goes well with the design and score, but is completely pointless as your teammates can teleport, and the aliens appear to be of a bootleg variety, with no acidic blood (it seems more like they are just spewing lemonade), facehuggers that cannot subdue anything, and aliens that forget they can climb on surfaces and use stealth.\n\n\nThe game is also so contrtadicting in it's nature, it gives a "no marine left behind" flick, wherein the beginning of the game you and your squad are almost killed due to a fellow marine blowing himself (and others around him) up because a chestburster ripped through him.\nOr making it that marines don't know what facehuggers are, yet they somehow can identify different types of xenomorphs (even in pitch black).\n\nNot great, not bad, just unrelentingly disappointing.\n\nIf you're looking for a action FPS, go look at AvP, a much better entry, not only allowing you to be a colonial marine, but also a xenomorph or predator.\nIf you're looking for a more true to the series entry, go look at Alien: Isolation, as it gets almost everything right.","November 27, 2015","false","57.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","16","20","3","1"

That being said I did purchase this during holiday sale off Amazon for $1.99 and several months have passed since relase date.  Gearbox has patched the game up to eliminate and improve some issues.  I can understand people that pre ordered and spent $60 on this game, I would def be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and upset as it is nowhere near worth that money, but for 2 bucks it surely is.\n\nBeing a fan of the Alien franchise and growing up in the late 70's/early 80's I can appreciate the tone of this game and the sense of art style seems to be a throwback to that era.  Graphics are terrible by todays standards and what we should be getting, however I thought the Alien models looked really well done and were true to Alien lore.  The sound was failry bad to, mostly the dreadful voice work, the ambient sound and alien hisses were good though.  Gameplay is really straight forward to the tune of run n gun, with a checkpoint save system.\n\nI have certainly played a lot more trash garbage games than ACM and in my opinion should not be labeled as such, just a game that was falsely advertised and was way below potential on a galactic level - BUT if you can pick it up cheap its worth a run through, which I thought was fun and ok.","January 1, 2014","true","27.9"," 265 of 475 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","265","475","0","15"

I DID buy this on sale knowing it had recieved terrible reviews. I decided to give it a go anyways because I guess I had to see for myself exactly how bad it truely was. So this is my literal 25 something minutes of playing this absolute ♥♥♥♥ game.\n\nStart the game and have a feel for the controls for the first time. I was getting use to the iron sights and started customizing the controls to better fit my liking. I discover a marine all snotted up on the wall, telling me to cut him down.  The cutscene plays of my character using his torch to cut this guy down. I hear the alien making noises during the cutscene and the alien just crawls up next to my character FNAF style and grabs my hand, then hisses.  The alien then glitches out on the wall spinning around in a circle allowing me to shoot and kill him really easily.... Lets just say that wasn't a very good first impression. Something I was supposed to expect in future battles im guessing.....\n\nSo we reach a landing bay area where there is a big dropship sitting in the center. Theres two Aliens on top of some cargo containers next to the drop ship. There were also TWO marines, 1 with a smart gun and the other with a pulse rifle behind some cargo crates shooting at them. The person I had cut down decides the best corse of action is to throw a grenade at the ship...... Seriously? For two aliens you think to throw a grenade when you could have just shot them. The grenade blew up the whole drop ship..... It was such a stupid plot idea that Sega should be sued for writing such a terrible plot line.\n\nAfter I save the day with about 45 seconds of none stop aliens runing towards us while some idiot marine tries to unlock some door behind me. We finally set back off back to where we started this ♥♥♥♥ mess of a game. While traveling down this weird long space hallway..... The marine that I had cut down earlier starts having his predictable spaz attack before the chest burst. And im sitting here thinking. OK....The alien is going to pop out and run off towards the Marine's ship or something. NOPE!\nThe Dude Alu akbarz himself with a grenade. Completly destroying the bridge and killing like 2 other marines with me..... You and some other loser survies the blast. Say some corny ♥♥♥♥ to each other, and I quit the ♥♥♥♥ing game out of RAGE.\n\nThe end? No! You see.... After I quit the game, it had started itself right back up again! Steam kept telling me that it was "running AVP" and would launched the game every time I would try to quit. Took me 4 times just to be fast enough to click "delete local content"\n\nThis game is a ♥♥♥♥ing virus. I do hope whoever was in charge of this games devolopment was fired and sued for the companys losses.","January 12","false","0.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","78","14","18","9","3"

Screw you Gearbox.\n\nOriginal demo gameplay which should of been the gameplay but wasn't.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fHv4wQJfSY\n\nI bought the PC version on a whim, only because I had extra cash to burn. I played the PC version about a year later after the release of launch date. They did patch the game and with slightly better graphics. Still not as good as the suppose demo of the game but at least it was better than on launch.\n\nThe graphics are passable but at times the game texture looks like a late stage PS2 or original Xbox game. Even with the improvements, the game still looks a bit choppy. The controls are actually very solid, mind you I played with mouse/keyboard. The enemy AI was improved from launched but still needs work.\n\nThe gameplay on this game is just average and you don't really feel any tension like you should when playing a game like this. What I really didn't like about this game was half of the stages you are fighting Wayland mercs instead of aliens. Even Aliens vs Predator (2010) did a better job of this when you played the marine. Multiplayer co-op is at least fun but I would crank it up to the highest difficulty to get the most out of it. The game is rather short and the storyline is forgettable. As for online multiplayer matches, it's pretty much dead unless you find a Steam group or have a good amount of friends to play with.\n\nI would not buy this game unless you really really like Aliens or have friends to play with. If you are undecided, I would wait until it goes on sale for $5.\n\nOverall I would have to rate this game a 5/10, even with the improvements and patches.","June 14, 2014","false","10.9"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","23","36","0","0"

I do want to mention however, that I bought this game on sale for $1.99 and after many of the patches that fixed the early glitches, which made playing through the story mode pleasant. The graphics are OK, but could be better. The gameplay can be sometimes unforgiving, but once you get the hang of it (don't let the aliens sneak up on you), you'll increase your odds of staying alive. Soundtrack: awesome. Story: great. A lot of people complained about the story in this game as well, but I think they forget that this is based off a simple action movie. If you want more story, play a game that ties into aliens 3 (definitely more drama and story driven) than the action driven Aliens 2. All in all, for $1.99, I have no regrets and I'm glad I purchased and played the game that brought back many good alien killing memories.","December 25, 2013","true","14.1"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

I immediately recognized the characters and especially the buildings I saw in the movie.\n\nThe story connects directly after the movie, when a second team of marines answer to a distress call from Cpl. Hicks, one of the survivors of the movie.\n\nThe story is simple. You are a marine and there are aliens. There are also evil humans you should "only fire at when fired upon". Those orders stand for almost full 10 seconds!\n\nIt is very fast paced and the AI isn't too challenging. The aliens are not that good at hiding and prefer a simple assault, which makes them the inferior race. On some occasions the game has a little twist which made me quite enjoy it. Some sneeky parts for example where funny, especially in Coop.\n\nI played it with 2 of my friends on Hardened difficulty and we managed to finish it in about 6 hours.\n\nSome of the menus are quite hidden and I would've loved to play an alien campaign.\n\nAll in all solid.

The game took so long to release, was so hyped every step of the way and every change in developer, and was so rabidly sought after from the moment it was announced to be in the works that it was doomed to bad press the instant the overhype and anticipation were not 100% sated. People expected a masterpiece of modern gaming based in the Aliens universe, what they got instead was a decent example of more old-school shooter style gaming based in the Aliens Universe. Not the greatest, but good none-the-less and fun. Sadly seems too many people overlook that in favor of complaining that its not the Alpha-male of a game they expected.\n\nThe story, while full of the passing plot hole here and there if your a devoted enough Aliens fan to even notice them, is par for the course when it comes to Alien franchise games. The conrols work, the xenos are relentless when they appear, Weyland-Yutani corp are ♥♥♥♥♥ and so are their mercs, and the multiplayer is fun as hell and lets you play as both Aliens and Marines with upgradable weapons and evolutions and unlockable costume bits for cosmetic appeal.\n\nGameplay is the older shooter style when your marines, no cover-shooter mechanics here just straight up crouch and shoot logic where anything you can fit fully behind is your cover if it stops bullets or buys you a few seconds to reload while swarms of xenos decend onto you. Yeah I said stop bullets, good ol Wey-Yu has sent mercs to secure the place and elimate you pesky and nosey UMC Marines and while alot of people complain about that I point out the following: EVERY ALIEN GAME AT SOME POINT HAS HUMANS KILLING OTHER HUMANS. Why? See above: Weyland-Yutani Corp is a ♥♥♥♥ and Mr. Yutani himself is the biggest ♥♥♥♥ of all. Don't Beleive me? google the dude and look up his track record in the various games, movies, comics, and books. He is a horrible person...well...android who body jumps from andriod to andriod whenever he dies anyway because he is such a troll with such a need to contiue to troll that he uploaded his brain before dying into a computer and downloads himself into androids to make himself immortal to troll the rest of mankind for eternity.\n\nThat there is the best in-universe reason to kill humans in this game there is. And its a good reason. Because ♥♥♥♥ Wey-Yu.\n\nUnfortunatly the multiplayer, which imo is AMAZING to play, is kinda dead. No one plays it so you can never find a match, but maybe someday it will come back. Even without it the singleplayer is fun and can get your heart pounding in spots, and for the first time in any aliens game the smartgun is not only 100% visually accurate with 100% accurate sound effects, but you get the propper smartgun eyepiece that tracks and highlights moving targets in range for you and auto-targets them based on whichever is closest to the crosshairs...just like the movie. That alone is a Plus even if you only use the thing once because until you run out of ammo and have to dump it you feel like a bad ♥♥♥. You feel like your right in the movie when they break that bad boy out and its cutting down xenos by the dozens.\n\nAnother great feature for single player is the motion tracker. It picks up ALL motion in its range not just living things, again just like in the films, and nothing will startle you more when its been far too quiet for far too long when that thing starts to ping because it picked up some phantom signal from a bit of shifting debris or a swinging cable. And nothing makes your heart thump and set you into panic mode like suddenly having the thing go into overdrive, making you pull it up to see what the hell is going on, then see just a massive blob of dots moving closer on the tracker but nothing in the hallway. Because you know its real that time, thats xenos not some random false reading, theres alot of them, they are close, and most teriffying is that you cant see them. So you start to backpeddle and pray they come out of the vents in small  numbers instead of all at once and that its not right in your face.\n\nAnd thats why I love this game, its everything an aliens game should be and nothing more. Its suspensful, atmospheric, heartpounding, and surprisingly immersive if you can get over some of the flatter voice acting bits in otherwise tense moments. You feel like a UMC Marine caught in a life or death surival situation with only a few people to help you out at best, only yourself more often then not, and your in over your head. But your a marine you have your duty to finish the mission AND get your ♥♥♥ and the asses of as many fellow marines as you can back home when your done.\n\nNo one said life in the UMCM was a glorious one, and its a bughunt down there. But damn is it an exciting and Fun life.","July 12, 2014","true","42.4"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

This recent playthrough is ten hours of my life I'll never get back, and yes, ten sounds like a lot, but it was really only so much because I kept dying from bugs and glitches, like xenomorphs clawing me through indestructible obstacles and suicidal mercenaries that charge me with explosives. Two years after release, its gone from a mostly broken and buggy, poorly designed game with terrible AI to a fairly broken and buggy, poorly designed game with terrible AI. Not quite as terrible as at launch, but a turd doesn't become any less of a turd just because you put a cherry on top of it, it just ends up being a waste of a cherry. All the hours spent patching this game and creating its DLC would've been better spent by Gearbox (or TimeGate, or whoever else really made the game) towards a project that could actually be saved.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting it to screw around with friends in multiplayer with, don't. While it can be some fun that way, its a graveyard online and if you want a multiplayer Aliens fix you'd probably just be better off playing Killing Floor with the Aliens mod or some of the previous AvP games which actually have some occassional activity.\n\nIf you're thinking of giving it to somebody as a joke gift, don't.

BUT, thanks for TemplarGFX overhaul mod (Google it!)... GAME CHANGER MOD! Lots of improvements (visuals, improved A.I., 5 times to use SmartGun, fewer clippings, etc)! I played the 4.5 version and I've enjoyed my second playthrough of ACM much more!\nACM with TemplarGFX mod RATING: 6.5 / 10\n\nSTASIS INTERRUPTED DLC:Three stories intertwined by three different characters and each offer a distinct story set before the ACM beginning. Aside from the story and characters, you don't have anything new. But the gameplay is pretty much worth it though.\nRATING: 6.0 / 10\n\n\nREVISED REVIEW:Aliens: Colonial Marines was in development for at least SIX years. A game that I kept on my radar very closely and been monitoring its development progress. And even after reading the multitudes of bad reviews, I still kept that Collector's Edition preorder from the UK, hoping that the game could still be fun... right? NOPE! BIG PILE OF DUNG IT IS!\n\nAliens vs. Predator 2010 was lackluster and disappointing but NOTHING compared to ACM! How could a game be released in such a bad state especially after the impressive 2011 PRESS GAMEPLAY DEMO?\n\n\nPROS:+Decent shooting (the action is fun).\n+Music, Sounds and the Ambiance like the films (most sounds are authentic from Aliens).\n+Tried the MP quickly and it's possibly the only good thing about the game.\n+Exploring the USS Sephora / USS Sulaco and Hadley's Hope colony was a good fan service from the developers,\n+Weapons Upgrade system\n\nCONS:-PATHETHIC A.I. Aliens, humans and the O'Neil NPC are atrocious.\n-Using the M56 SmartGun for about 10 minutes in the whole campaign.\n-Weak campaign story problems/inconsistencies.\n-Dated graphics.\n-Contextual situations (these pre-rendered "autoplay" animation that you don't have any control over your character (activating switches, etc). I've died a few times already on the game because of that lame mechanic).\n\nOVERALL:Gearbox & other developers & SEGA lied to fans and released a rushed product whose development got changed a few times until SEGA ordered release. Buy cheap and play with TemplarGFX Mod!\n\nVERDICT:Gearbox outsourced ACM to other studios. Shady development and using SEGA's money to develop Borderlands 2 means ACM got facehugged. Gearbox messed up real bad! At least, thanks to TemplarGFX MOD, this game is worthy of a revisit! GET ACM CHEAP THOUGH!\n\nRATING:4.5 / 10","April 30","true","24.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","4"

Aliens: Colonial Marines had the right ingredients to do something great, an official license to use all the original material from the films and a studio developing it with a rich history in making action packed games.\n\nThe results however are horrible. The initial and much talked about gameplay preview that was first shown turned out to be a glorified pre-rendered cinematic and the end result what we have now looks nothing like what was promised. The graphics are average at best and the game is ridden with bugs and glitches even after many patches.\n\nThe story is crap and does nothing good with the original material. The gameplay seems uninspired and linear, the enemy AI is ridiculously bad and the so called co-op is downright laughable. I think the only thing that turned out okay was the sound and the music but even that can't help the complete lack of atmosphere and originality in this game.\n\nI honestly can't recommend this for any price.

The game is still really hard and if you play on any difficulty beyond the easiest mode ( There are 4-5 difficulty levels) then you will die repeatedly. The checkpoints are far apart and often I had to play through difficult parts over and over. They have series in the game when events are happening such as the following: your supposed to get to the third level of a triple story circular generator room. Clear level 1 and get in elevator (ok that was hard but now im past it), clear level 2 and get to elevator (ok that was harder but I made it finally), clear level 3 and cover marine while he cuts the doo.... aww crap died (wait what? I have to start at level 1 again?) this happens over and over again. in the game and the checkpoints make it hard as you have to basically memorize where each alien will come from in a sequence to make it through, which I enjoyed because of the challenge. on medium or hard difficulty one or two swipes from aliens will kill and they are fast as hell. Havent even tried it on badass, I stuck it on easy and I still get killed every now and then, but hey aliens are supposed to be hard to kill...

It's got flaws (but what game hasn't), it had a dodgy develpment (so do many games), a dodgy story and it was rushed out the door (also like many games). Luckily I didn't buy it full price and got it for PC not the shoddy console version (many of the games issues are probably because they couldn't get it running on console so had to drop volumetric fog and most lighting effects). On that basis I DO recommend the game, but NOT to mega FPS fans, there's better FPSs out there. But, if you're a huge Aliens fan and would enjoy walking around the Sulaco's hanger..see Bishops legs and the airlock that the queen was flushed out of (albeit a tad small) you'll enjoy the game for that reason. The gameplay mechanics are wooden and simple point and shoot with a few variations, I enjoyed the smart gun section (but would have liked the option to keep it, for balance the game could have doubled or tripled the enemy count), I enjoyed exploring the Derelict, walking around the "Gunner" from Alien was pretty damn cool! The sounds are all there, motion tracker..Pulse rifle etc. When you have the motion tracker you can't shoot so there's a bit of tension there. Ultimately as a gamer I'd give it 5/10, but as an Alien/Aliens fan I give it 2 more points for a respectible 7/10. The game is an example of most of the flaws of the gaming industry and some pretty shoddy decisions and practises (but similar stuff is going on in other industries ALL the time anyway). Oh and one tip...do NOT turn the gamma/brightness up, keep the game DARK and the lighting and atmosphere is much improved....Eurogamer did a comparison of the game v the demo and part of the problem was the brightness on the finshed game in their vid was WAY too high.","November 17, 2014","true","33.2"," 46 of 84 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","46","84","3","2"

I wouldn't let that stop you from buying it, though.  The big patch released by Gearbox really did help the graphics and AI issues a lot, and made the game much more playable.  I only played a bit of the campaign in SP, but found it pretty lackluster; overall it wasn't scary or even tense, and had nothing on the previous Aliens games.  But the game really started to shine in the co-op multiplayer.  It was actually a lot of fun working through the campaign with a couple friends, as well as the Bug Hunt DLC.  As for the story - a lot of people had problems with it, me included.  It really made no sense and had several glaring plot holes that actually made me mad at a couple points.  However, the Stasis Interrupted DLC actually did an admirable job of bringing the plot together and explaining the holes, and I ended up being pretty pleased with the story overall.  I don't know whether all that was originally planned, or whether there was some mad scrambling at Gearbox to try and explain things, but it's too bad you had to play through the whole game, then play the DLC just to have the story make any kind of sense.  All in all, it's worth playing if you have 2 or 3 friends and are willing to shell out for the DLC.","November 26, 2013","true","23.7"," 69 of 129 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","69","129","0","0"

Fairly generic shooter with a great movie tie-in, what can go wrong? Well, lots! A little buggy Ai, spawns and collision geometry can spoil some of the suspense that it does manage to drum up, but enjoyable enough for a few hours, for a few bucks (not retail price though!). Audio is a great help to the overall mood of the game and consistent to fans of the movie.\n\nThe Long:\nI paid $10 for the whole meal deal, DLC's and all. Also, I am writing at time when all the extensive patches and fixes have been implemented. If you paid full price without the patches, my sympathies and your wrath probably is justified, that's a guess.\n\nWith that in mind, the 2014 edition is enjoyable to play like a marine in the Aliens world. Weapons are what terran space marines expect, short the melee weapons. The gun fire is satisfying and shooting mechanic is spot on, would love to have more smart gun though :) Weapons upgrades are more like sidegrades for the most part, and is really more about personal preference and style of tactics of the player. I play more like infantry, so it's pulse rifles, battle rifles and shotguns..wait, that's all there really is in the game! Flamer is a special pick up weapon, as is the smart gun ;_;\n\nThe Aliens themselves are well crafted and can catch you by surprise if you don't use your radar and terrain carefully. Alien animations are a bit jerky at times when they are transitioning to more complex transitions or moves, especially when they get into your melee region and the game is trying to decide which melee scenario to piece in (up close execution or 1 of the varied push backs) I played this on the hardest setting from the get go and found some parts challenging, but it was pretty easy for the most part.  The boss fights are a real let down, too easy or just brain dead, example: the lifter, punched with the left claw only....Big Alien Al down for the count as I punched it to the corner where it died in frightening death animation glitchies.\nHonestly, if the Aliens were faster and more deadly with the same numbers, the game would be almost unplayable because the Zeno's would be all over the place and will kill you in an instant even if you got a shot off due to the acid blood and lurking face huggers. Try the Killing Floor Aliens mod and you will understand what I mean, HoE will destroy or put on edge the most well honed of teams in the more confined maps.\n\nThe environments are well put together and believeable to exist in the Colonial Marine world, some places could use a bit more polish, but it's all well presented for the most part. The level designs are pretty generic with some set pieces for bosses. Don't know what you are looking for if some find this game ugly or inconsistent with Aliens.\n\nIf you are a fan, I recommend this game at a discount price. There are still some bugs that are unforgiveable given the patches and fixes in place (Aliens spawning infront of me, ok, i shoot it...then another spawns in the same spot...bad!), but they don't brake the overall game and atmosphere. ACM gives us a bit more back story to the events after Alien3 and what will happen in future stories, and that is maybe the best thing that can be said about this game.","May 2, 2014","true","18.1"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"

The game is beautiful and couldn't feel more "Cinematic"\n\nIt's about Colonial marines not Aliens so giving a bad review because you kill humans? Well Read some about the Colonial marines, there's a few good sources one of which is the old RPG game with the extra book "Technical manual"\n\nBasically , the Colonial marines do not fight Xenomorphs all day long, they actually do fight humans far more often.\nAlso this is put as a Sequel to the 2nd Alien movie, and in my opinion for being a game like this Does it really well. Aliens was never really scary, it was an Intence thrilling Alien Action movie with some terrifying moments at the most.\n\nWho can honestly  say this game has not got that feeling of Aliens from 1986?  I think it do, Also the fact that you have to hold the movement detector and not have your gun ready makes it even more Aliens 1986 realistic. I've had great fun playing this game, I'm an Alien fan from childhood when watching the first movie and 2nd around 1986-87.\n\nThe sounds in this game are incredible Cinematic as well, what do people complain about here? Play the 2nd Alien movie (Aliens) Listen to the chaotic scenes where aliens come from all directions and you'll have exactly the same feeling and sounds. The graphics are great with the Movie grain turned on (looks a lot like watching the film imo)\n\nI'm not sure in any way why people have actually given this such bad reviews, for me comparing it with Shooter games like this it's 9 out of 10  The only real thing i could point out as being maybe a tiny bit bad was the Animations from time to time. But I wouldn't give this game 1 out of 10 for that, like a lot of other people seem to do.\n\nBuy it, IF you're a REAL Aliens fan (2nd movie with Colonial Marines in it) Then you should love this one, if not well. :) I'm sure if you look deep in your mind you've seen a lot worse and given it much better rating then 3-4 out of 10\n\nBuy it, play CO-OP and feel the crazy action around you :) Cuz it's nonstop and it IS crazy\n\ncheers!","July 2, 2014","true","28.0"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","2"

I'm a huge Alien(s) fan and I hoped to God that this game would be good, but gearbox really messed it up ( or did they ? ). After all, we will never know why this game turned out so horribly, maybe we will. I recommend this game only for >10 bucks/euros or lower. No more. Also, aside from the Bug Hunt DLC, don't buy any other ones, it's pointless since the matchmaking system is dead.\nPros:\n>Amazing audio/sound track\n>Iconic locations from the movies (ex: Hadley's Hope, Sullaco)\n>Hicks is in it ( for me it feels awesome to battle xenos alongside people from the Aliens 1986 movie)\nCons:\n>Awfull AI\n>Horrible story + ending ( don't even get me started on the final boss battle)\n>Overpowered marines + too much gear/ammo at once\n>Co-op/Multiplayer is pretty much dead (you only have to have a lot of friends to play this)\n>STUPID ALIENS (XENOS)\n>outdated graphics (for 2013 standards, AvP 2010 looks better IMO )\nIf you find yourself in a steam sale and this is for under >10, get it.

The gunplay is clunky at best. It's very slow paced with little variety in the enemies you fight any any given time. The auto save function is also badly implemented and you regularly find yourself forced to go through several dice roll live/die encounters only to get cheap shotted at the last one and having to start the entire series over again.\n\n2. Your deaths feel cheap - Rarely will you have a "good" or "fun" fight. Either you clean up the Aliens with very little challenge or they will over run you and you die in 1-2 hits. While this melee quick death mechanic is understandable you typically find it happening because the Aliens will glitch and ignore your pushback attack, or because a friendly NPC doesn't pull his own weight - leaving you to ration out your precious bullets while they stand in an empty corner waiting for something interesting to happen. Which brings us to -\n\n3. The AI is awful. You a regularly forced to rely on AI controlled partners who forget what their job is. Whether it's opening a door, covering you while you open a door, or sometimes even simply moving out of the way is often well outside of thier ability. The Aliens are equally glitchy. As previously mentioned they will sometimes  ignore your melee attack (often the only thing that will stop a quick death) or leap off of walls and just kind of forget what they were doing. The game is loaded with jump scares where a Xenomorph will leap out of a hatch and then loiter casually while they wait for you to kill them. They have a difficult time going through open doorways and it seems that the only challenge they pose is the occasional cheap death\n\n4. The game is ugly - Not a lot to say about this. The textures in this game are unforgivably bad. The Aliens have few animations which makes they look kind of silly when they're doing anything but wall running. It looks like they try to hide some of this behind a very distracting film grain but even that does little to keep the game from looking 10 years older than it really is.\n\n5. The Story is terrible - Just... just terrible. While there are many nostalgic things to see and easter eggs to find you're better off just rewatching the movies because it's not worth the time to slog through the game to find them. The dialogue is ham fisted, even for action movie meatheads and much of the "Story" seems like a series of very poorly scripted events that make little to no sense  *Spoilers* Why would a trained Marine throw a grenade at a missile which is sitting near your only way out? Why would multiple umbilicals between the ships break for seemingly no reason? All of this is almost forgivable if the end of the game wasen't completely given away within the first 10 minutes if you have even the most basic knowledge of the Alien series\n\nTL;DR  No, just no. If this game goes on sale for two dollars, it's still not worth the time to play through it. Instead my suggestion would be to pop "Aliens" into your DVD player and just make gun noises at the screen during action sequences.","February 14, 2015","false","2.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

This might be the most controversial game of the last 10 years! No joke!\nMoving right on! Developed by Gearbox, TimeGate and Nerve, A:CM's story is a true sequel to 1986's Aliens, produced by James Cameron (amazing film) and also Alien 3 (which was kinda sh*tty) and the story meets my expectations and actually exceeds them, although I need to be fair and say that the ending is a bit disappointing AND there was this major plot point that never really got explained in the game (How the hell did the Sulaco get out of Fury 161?). It could use a bit more work, but as a sequel to the movies, it works pretty well and it's quite enjoyable throughout the whole campaign, out of all the 4 Movies + this game...Colonial Marines might have the best story out of all 5, really!\n\n(let's face it, Alien(s) never had a good story to begin with... so... it's like a rotten apple in the middle of a pile of dog ♥♥♥♥...)\n\nGameplay: It's great! The sound of the Pulse Rifle just bursting away and the acid spewing from the Xenos is always great and the guns feel amazing! Just like I wanted them too! Some new guns were also introduced, something very risky and hard to pull off, but they nailed it, they feel like they have been there since the original movie! You will fight hordes of Xenos and PMC's throughout the game (the PMC's appear and are explained like in the 2nd level, and while I expected only to be fighting Xenos, the PMC's make sense in the story, surprinsingly!)\n\n- Acid doesn't damage you, though... WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!\n\nAs for gameplay, I must also address the Xenomorph gameplay (they are only playable in the Multiplayer modes though). They feel much better compared to the Aliens from AVP2010, which felt very wonky and hard to control.The view is now 3rd person! F-I-N-A-L-L-Y!\nEvery fatality you pull off and every swipe with the claws feel amazingly nice and it's alot of fun! Too bad the Multiplayer is *almost* dead (you can still find some matches occasionally).\n\nGraphics: Bad, the graphics are a massive disappointment, they look very different from the 2011 Demo and the Xenos (unlike in the Demo) like disappear after they die, something that didn't happen during the demo gameplay. The game, sadly, also has a few bugs/glitches. I beat the game twice (Soldier (which is normal) and Hardened, doing a 3rd now on Recruit (easy) to collect all the dog tags that are left (Missed like 3) and planning on doing a 4th playthrough on Ultimate Badass mode (it's the f*cked up mode, basically)) and I've witnessed 1 game breaking bug, where a door would just not open! Restarted the game and everything was fixed. Bugs, I found few but some...The most annoying was the Raven Boss battle, which involved the use of a PowerLoader. The Raven Boss battle has the Raven get stuck in some corners (which is the best part, just spam him with attacks xD) and some times teleport to the other corner of the arena. It's by far the worst part of the game, because of how extremely clunky it is!\n\nSound Quality: Amazingly Stellar, the guns sound the same as in the movie Aliens (they used the sound files from the movie so, there's that), the voice acting is solid (for the most part), I found it engaging and the characters sounded decently emotional when they should (too bad the facial animations are sh*t so when they are happy and sad, they look the same, something from like 2006, but this is part of graphics, not the sound, so anyways...), the lip syncing is a hit and miss, sometimes it's great, amazing actually, and sometimes it's just plain bad, so there's that as well...\nI think I've pretty much covered everything (except what is the controvesy around this game, I'll post it in the comments for those who don't already know it...)\n\nTo finish it off, Aliens: Colonial Marines is... *shocker* not a bad game! But it's not great either and this game could pull off a GOTY award, it really really could! But to my sadness (as a kind of Hardcore fan of the Aliens franchise), it's far from a GOTy contender.\n\n6.5/10, flawed on pretty much every aspect of it, it reeks potential, which btw, sadly isn't met. However! The fact that this game is REALLY FUN is undenyable imo. Thus the score...\n\nFlame away, ♥♥♥♥♥es! I enjoyed A:CM even though Pitchford lied his ♥♥♥ off about it. Unexcusable, true; but that doesnt mean it ain't fun. Like a janky space version of Left 4 Dead...kinda.\n\n(REVIEW EDITED TO FIX TYPOS)","August 11, 2013","true","31.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","9"

Literally the only saving grace is Bug hunt mode which is a seperate DLC where you defend against Waves of Aliens in co-op. It's awesome and i highly recommend you buy the game just for this mode alone. Sadly with the main game within half of one level you're already fighiting waves of humans. What is this i'm playing? Call of Duty Alien Ops? Most of the core game has you fighting humans with some Aliens here and now thrown into the mix. There's literally no respect for the Aliens in this game they are mindless drones with bare bones AI. The tension is ruined by the fact you can carry 15 weapons stocked up with ammo. Seriously? In the movie all they had was a few pulse rifles a busted up Flame Thrower and a couple of Grenades. Here its easy mode though.\n\nDon't buy this game for the online because its dead, no one plays this game anymore, which forces it into a singleplayer only game. Now then, unless you have buddies who are willing to pay for this game, Then the mode you should play is Bug Hunt.\n\nThings the game does right is the Sound Design. The game Sounds awesome! And that's awesome. Also the Visuals are quite good. The game nails the look of the movies down to the bolts on the walls.\n\nEverything else is trash. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, You'd better spend your money on AVP2010 or AVP Gold. More fun and enjoyable and both games are made by a developer who actually care about the francise.","December 8, 2014","false","38.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","1"

When a game takes this long to be made there should have been red flags up by now. Colonial marines is one of those games that people got really hyped for and well got their dreams crushed.\n\nThe story feels like a bad alien fan fic with characters that are so memorable i forgot who they were after I played the game. hell the story is almost as bad as alien 3.\n\nThe visuals are mediocre Some ok modelling and it does do the job well of recreating some elements of the movies, I can Admit I did like the designs of the new xenos which are more plausable than say well a winged xeno with fire breath or something. though the particle effects look so bad they even show jaggies and the pixels. sound fairs better, but not much the sound effects again do a faithful job recreating the feel of the movies.\n\nAs for the gameplay well it's a fairly decent fps. The shooting is competant and shooting xenos CAN be enjoyable just good luck finding that. I do appreciate the retro fps elements like the healthpacks,carrying all the weapons and some exploration by finding certain guns and audio logs. the enemy ai despite what people will tell you *cough* angry joe are not that stupid infact they do what they should do attack the player hell sometimes the enemy was a major threat in some cases in my playthrough. the ally AI it's bad but it isn't a major problem unless you heavily rely on them which you don't. The multiplayer has it's moments but it isn't acceptional.\n\nOverall Colonial Marines is just an average fps. Was I dissapointed? yes Could it have been better? yes.

At the time of its original release, the game was incomplete and many felt it had been falsley advertised graphically etc. I also feel sorry for the pre-order people who got somewhat cheated in that respect. That sucks - the lesson there though is, don't pre-order a pc game ever. However, having bought the game about 2 weeks ago for 5 pounds (inc DLC), I have yet to encounter any bugs or glitches -  Gearbox have gone back and done a huge amount of patching, around 10GB worth (much to their credit) - EXCEPT for the very strange one when you try to quit the game and for some reason steam keeps re-launching the game over and over....there are easy fixes for that problem though, so it's really not a big deal. Apart from that, the bugs all seem to be fixed and it runs fine for me.\n\nI have really enjoyed this game so far and I expected to turn it off straight away based on what all the other reviews say. But you need to realise that those reviews have everything to do with feeling 'cheated' on initial release and nothing to do with the quality of the actual CURRENT game. The graphics are actually CURRENTLY really nice; not next gen but nearly there - definitely top quality with awesome lighting effects. The strength of this game comes from how they have replicated the atmosphere and feel of the films through use of graphics and animation style - it's really authentic and true to Aliens -  and that is how the graphics succeed. It's not about technicality. If you love Aliens (the second film) this is definitely for you, as you get to go to many of the sick locations from the film and they are accurately portrayed.\n\nGOOD THINGS:\nThe gameplay is really fun. If you wanted to be the marine, this is your chance. In honesty it's not perfect, but it's nearly there; Aliens limbs fly off when you shoot; your bullets feel like they connect well; the acid blood is well done; the sound of the guns - infact all the game sounds - are taken directly from the film so its absolutely great and authentic. It feels awesome firing that pulse rifle with its signature noise. Great selection of guns  espcecially with the dlc. The music is the same as the film which makes the atmosphere and experience really strong. The level art, escpecially in Hadleys Hope is excellent. Baddies can be blown to bits - I shot a dudes head off with HIcks' shotgun and loved it - and they die really well at times. Also the game has alot of style to its scripted and non scripted events! Solid voice acting.\n\nBAD THINGS:\nThings that let the game down are really minor and depend on how picky you are. For example some surfaces don't recieve bullet holes, some do. Some glass breaks, some doesn't. Many objects are static when they should have havoc or physX - but some do move and are destructible. Some dead bodies are identical to the next. Aliens corpses disappearing shortly after death. Generally it can feel a little rushed in places - moments when you think 'oh, they coulda done that a bit better...'\n\nFINAL WORD:\nIt's a shame because it's only just short of being a perfect Aliens experience and it's as if they ran out of time - demonstrated by the rushed feel of identical dead bodies, surfaces that don't take bullet holes etc. HOWEVER DON'T LET THAT OR THE MINOR THINGS DETER YOU! You get so engrossed in the frantic slaying of xenomorphs that all these minor bad points really do fall into the background: they are over powered by everything good about the game. I urge you to try it but don't pay more than a tenner I would say. NOTE: For best experience, always fire from the hip as the iron sights make the gun look/feel like a toy - once you upgrade to laser sight this becomes easy and the shooting feels great again.\nThis really is a strong game, with a few disappointing things to note, but it is by no means ♥♥♥♥: if it was ♥♥♥♥ I would say because I have high standards....SO DEFINITELY PLAY IT! Especially if you are an Aliens fan! But again just don't spend more than a tenner.","July 26, 2015","true","9.7"," 49 of 92 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","49","92","7","0"

I love this franchise and don't judge! Even if most everyone else thinks this game is a piece of crap. I was among the many that stayed away because of the reviews and how much people felt cheated and lied to. After the patch, it became something different which is why I even considered forking over the $5 for this game. I will also admit that this isn't the same thing that was shown at E3, maybe a financial thing came up and they had to reduce things to be able to finish the product. Also, keep in mind that it wasn't just Gearbox that worked on this game, there were a few other studios who had their hands in as well funds more than likely had to be distributed evenly among the developers.\n\nI'm 27 years old and I was exposed to this franchise at a young age I remember being on the edge of my seat chewing on my nails because the movies were so intense.\n\nNow for the review. At first glance this game doesn't seem like much and most people need to be hooked in the first five minutes otherwise it's a flop or you have those that have played it for hours and hours and still feel cheated. In my case, that's not the truth here even though it kind of had a slow take off I will admit that I did get spooked a little bit even though the graphics are not top notch, but I don't care as long as the game has some sort of mechanic to make up for it. This game combines just enough intense moments, gun action, and Aliens that aren't as dumb as most people think to make up for the mediocre visuals, the new AvP wasn't that pretty either, but again visuals are not my primary focus when it comes to a franchise that I love. I personally think that they nailed the atmoshphere of the 1986 movie, the Aliens look great maybe just a little bit muddy up close, they feel real and can catch you quick if you aren't paying attention. There are moments where their AI literally stops making them a part of a shooting gallery with stationary targets. But when the AI does work, watch out! You'll be surprised.\n\nNow for the sound and music, just one word, WONDERFUL! Weapons, environmental ambience, screeches all sound legit, etc. Get a good sound system to really enjoy them.\n\nWould I recommend this game to a friend? Well, simple answer if they can see through the crap people claim about this game, sure. Otherwise it's not for everyone. It's always going to be a love to hate relationship with any game plain and simple.\n\n8 out of 10 for me, I'm pretty satisfied with it despite it's minor flaws. The truth is people, your beloved CoD, BF3/4, Halo, and anything else game related are not going to be 100% perfect and they won't always be what you want them to be. So, just play it and see for yourself.","June 19, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Нет интересных событий, нет зрелищ, нет постановки, нет умных тактических сражений, нет страха, нет атмосферы. Игра выглядит несовременно и неряшливо сделана, несмотря на детальную проработку. Физики оружия нет. Здесь можно увидеть, как вода подтекает из целой и невредимой трубы, ксеноморфы выползают из вентиляционных отверстий, за которыми зияет чернота, а персонажи иногда отказываются делать то, что велит им скрипт. Чужие не просто ведут себя глупо, они еще и нелогичны. Они выскакивают на свет, затем прыгают на стену, выползают на видное место и застревают там. Из врагов натурально падают ящички с гранатами, патроны и аптечки, по палубам «Сулако» разбросаны шлемы и бронежилеты.\n\nВ кампанию можно играть даже вчетвером, но сюжет для этого совсем не предназначен. В результате получается глупость: там, где по сюжету в одиночной игре должны были быть двое морпехов, оказываются сразу пятеро.\n\nВ игре четыре сетевых режима, из которых выделяется только «Спасение». Задача морпехов — пробежать из пункта А в пункт Б и выжить, задача чужих — помешать им и всех убить. Управлять чужими придется с видом от третьего лица, а анимация тут просто ужасна — нормально проползти через дверной проем уже составляет проблему, какие уж там скрытные атаки и молниеносные нападения. Карт для каждого режима только две. Моя оценка 6/10.\n","March 8, 2013","true","41.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That being said, I just played through from beginning to end and thoroughly enjoyed this title.

I pre-ordered this game (for PS3), got the collectors edition, and bought the season pass day one. All told I spent $100 dollars on this game ($105 now that I have it on Steam as well), and I must say that I feel all of the negative reviews to be a little bogus. I have beaten the single player campaign twice via co-op and once by myself, and spent countless hours in multi-player. I have played this game alot.\n\nIt is a good game, but not a great game. Maybe I was just lucky, but I have never had any of the glitches people talk about with this game, so its important to stress that they are not going to happen 100% of the time. I was really confused by all the glitch talk when the game first came out, to be honest, because nothing like that happened to me or my co-op buddy and we played through beginning to end on day one after going to the midnight launch. I've seen video, so I know they exist, but you are not guaranteed to see them.\n\nSecond, game-play is very standard shooter fare. But then again, its a shooter. You shoot things. The Aliens come at you from all angles, and you shoot them. Alot like the movie. No idea what the complaint here is. The guns sound awesome, the aliens go down about how you would expect, and the blood even harms you. Seems pretty straight forward. I think alot of people expected a splash of blood to kill you outright like in the movies, but that would just be unfun, unless it was some higher difficulty setting or something. You are a highly trained bad-♥♥♥ and you feel like it. Definitely more of a Halo than a survival horror game, but its what I expected. Maybe if you expected horror, you would be disappointed, but I knew this was a shooter from the moment I pre-ordered it.\n\nThird, the attention to detail in the lev\nels was cool. It was awesome to walk through the movie interiors, and everything felt like it should. Of course, according to plot the whole place was nuked, but this game is fan-service and nothing else about the plot makes sense, so why should this? I would rather have the fan-service moment and just enjoy it than ♥♥♥♥♥ about plot for a series not really known for its nuanced plots to begin with.\n\nTo sum up, I think that this game was exactly what I expected, and delivered everything I felt I was promised. Of course I went in expecting an 8/10 and I got roughly an 8/10. Some people I feel were mislead by cinematic trailers (the bane of the industry) and the hype machine, but really, what else could a movie tie-in game go but mediocre. There have been less than a handful of good movie games, and this is definitely in that category. Go in with realistic expectations, and you will have fun and that's the whole purpose.","June 19, 2014","true","8.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Add the Movie Skins, play on the tribute map and bingo jyou've got a ton of fun! Also a small group of madders have already taken out W-Y mercs and the dino aliens and have added Crushers and Boliers in at wave 30!

However after many patches this game actually is pretty okay. Albeit the characters are shallow, Aliens still look and act glitchy and like puppets, although the enemy AI is improved somewhat. I'm not gonna lie and say this is a great game, it's not, but it's not the most awful game I've played either now with the patches. In a way I'm tempted to say that this is only for most hardcore fans but then again, it's exactly those who this game is most likely to disappoint due to expectations not going to be met. Maybe I would recommend this for someone completely unaware to aliens and who does not care for plot or atmosphere but is rather looking for simple shooter mechanics. I personally like some of the DLC maps and with friends it can be even fun. You just need to adjust your mindset for acm and absolutely throw expectations out the window.\n\nThis game had a lot of potential and in a weird way it kind of shows through the ugly cracks.. You can see (at least with the mega patches) That there was somekind of genuine effort to save this game. There are so many nods to the franchise and touches here and there, which all would be AWESOME had the game not been halfassed in development. If this game had what Alien Isolation has this game would trump all over it. But it's the production values that let this puppy down. Everything feels unfinished or dated. The story feels rushed, unimaginative and hardly does justice to the films, even when it has the genuine characters and surroundings. Quite frankly, the story feels like it's written by someone who does not care for the movies or simply is untalented..\n\n-ADDED after playing DLC-\n\nThankfully here is where the excellent Stasis Interrupted DLC comes in and saves this whole game for me. The story, the atmosphere, even the level design is on a whole new level when compared to the normal campaign! I couldn't believe what a difference! The dreadful story holes are explained so that the story of this ties way more smoothly to Aliens saga and ties it all into the ending of Alien 3 too. In a not too bad way I think, albeit still far from perfect. The AI too seems ways better or then it's the way the levels are designed that push the enemy to flank you and surprise you in new ways. At least in ultimate badass mode. The problem however is the shortness of the DLC in comparison to the already short campaign of the main game. However I must say that I find this DLC redeeming this game enough for me to change it's status from not recommended to a RECOMMENDED for fans! In the stasis you even get some of that character development that was dreadfully missing from the main game. You start to feel something for characters. It's basically a new game in the shell of the main game, however tying into it's mechanics and story arch. So the Stasis Interrupted DLC is GOOD in my books.. Obviously it's still limited by the technology of the original ACM so don't expect miracles, but there was effort to correct what could be done without rewriting the whole game. Sadly complete rewrite IS what would be needed for win.\n\n-DLC bit ends-\n\nNow back to the MAINGAME review:\n\nThe other thing in MAIN GAME is the nonexistant character develompent which is closer to someone's home movie in direction and in complexity of character. Lousy voice acting, bad writing.. The Characters alone make this game a failure. Even if it had super graphics, the characters would ♥♥♥♥ you off. Something that ties in here with the characters is the AI which is broken, even with the patches it feels no good. Your guys will help you getting killed but DO NOT HELP you in any other way. It's not uncommon for O'neal to stand in your way, blocking door acces without shooting any enemies, while you begging him to let you through to get to cover from onslaught of bullets flying your way. This is definitely a game where friendly fire would be a good thing. O'neil needs to be capped off on many occasions..\nOr then he spouts embarassing commentary right out of a generic shooter while shooting at walls or crates even when the enemy is standing right in front of him. This game would be a better game if you'd be completely alone, rather than having your company ruin atmospehere and gameplay for you.\n\nObviously that's not how this game was designed to be, as you are a colonial marine. But that's the other thing. They had the idea of making you a part of a 'team' but then they don't even give you team. For the most part it's just you and some other marine, making your 'colonial marine squad' a band of 2 all the time with some short exceptions. You never feel like a marine in the single player.\nThe other 'marines' are puppets hanging in the background and having one animation or grunt. In one mission you had to search and rescue these other marines and they were completely lifeless and soulles like zombies when you rescue them. Not even eyes or mouths were moving when you save their LIFE, and then they disappear like the bodies do in the game so your'e left alone again. At least by modifying .ini values you can force the corpses to stay but in a way, why would you want that? It's better that they disappear from ruining your mood (irony)\n\nYet for some inane bizarre reason I've grown to like this game somewhat. Maybe it's like those b-scifi movies that are so bad it's kind of good.. Or I'm just crazy.On pc there are ways to make this game look better graphically and I would say WAY better in terms of atmosphere and lighting so you only end up disliking the rest in the end. I think since I've adjusted the graphics so that the locations look cool and atmospheric is the reason why I like this game now, with all it's gut wrenching flaws. Since the locations are the only thing they nailed in making this game (as far as old ut3 engine allows) It's now bringing back memories from the movie. Also MP levels have great design and nods to the movies, even nostromo is there although not part of the James Cameron version of the movie. Now that I've said a few positive comments, it's time again to burst the bubble on this game. The aliens suck bigtime. They are like puppets with dumb AI and only resemble by fraction the scary killing beast they were in the movies. They remind me of a zoo simulation where apes are running towards you and jumping up and down, getting stuck on walls and whatnot or just standing there with their butts towards you waiting for you to cap them off. Also there is no interaction with them whatsoever. They seem not even knowing you're unloading a clip at them, there's no reaction until the death animation kicks in. It makes them feel autobots rather than the scariest beast in the universe. Although this too changes in the Stasis Interrupted DLC where I suddenly felt anxious about an alien encounter. They should have focused wholly on aliens in the main game and spare the troopers of Weyland Yutani corp. to the DLC because here THEY FIT RIGHT IN to the story. In a not as terrible way! The story is told and moved along better. And it's great how the frantic fighting between them and aliens is made in, allowing you to be a rogue surprise for both aliens and humans.\n\nMultiplayer is fun too, that's the good part I find with this game, the MP Escape missions for instance where your frantically trying to get to a rescue ship while battling hordes of enemies and your team tries to open heavy doors and stuff while combating their way and healing downed marines because there's safety in numbers is fun to me. These matches get hectic and with the original sounding soundtrack booming in the background your heartrate may actually start to rise out of something else than just frustration.This game is not fun straight out of the box but it can grow on you.","February 7","true","100.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Being someone who grew up with the original AVP 1 and 2 on PC, i feel this adds some new elements to those past expereince and takes some away. Those that i feel were improvements were the ability to pull out your motion tracker instead of it being "built-in" to the hud, the graphics (obviously), the AI for sure, audio/atmospheric experience (Music, Gun sounds (Especially the "true to" movie M41-A), Alien sounds, and lighting). This game does however, as i said take away from some of the things that made the old AVP Marine campaign good and scary. I think the whole idea of having a team was a cool new expereince, but being forced to look out for yourself in the old AVP made it awesome, and scary. They could have done this by just minimizing the amount of campaign missions that you spend with your squad, and then toned down some of the combat encounters that you would otherwise die in without the help of your squad. I also feel that the old managment of your shoulder lamp battery was good and should have been kept and they could have made it more of a necessity by putting you alone in dark environments. Not only that but the flare system was good as well because it was another resource you had to keep track of. I know this one is more of a ridiculous thing to look at in most games today, but for games like AVP where you have plenty of cool weapons at your disposal, it's a shame you're limited down to 3 in your "hot-swap" tray whereas in AVP 1 and 2 you could have them all bound to keys "1-0". This is more of a nit-pick feature, but i also was disapointed in the ability to use doors to your advantage against the Aliens, because in AVP 2 there were a few times where you could do that and nothing beats the rush of knowing you have a creature who brings forth death right behind you and then you close the door right in their face (That might just be me though :) ). Overall the game is good and definitely not as bad as it's made out to be, i think most of the bad reviews came from people who never played the old games, or maybe i'm just a softy for the AVP franchise.","December 27, 2013","true","22.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But is it as horrible as people would have you believe? Not really. There are many worse games for sale. But fortunately, there are far more better games out there as well.\n\nMuch of the uproar about the game was about how its graphics failed to live up to the pre-release trailers; on launch, the game looked noticably poorer in comparison. But even in that sorry state, the game was hardly a disaster on the eyes; in many areas, it looked equivalent in quality to other multi-platform FPS games. In a select few areas, the game was actually quite nice looking, in fact. Since then, the developers have released a four gigabyte patch which rectifies many of the game's visual faults and - while it will never be competitive with games like Metro 2033 or Crysis 3 - can easily hold its own against the Call of Duty or similar games.\n\nNo, unfortunately, the problems with the game lay far deeper than the visual gloss. Almost every other area of the game was flawed, from the musical score, to the storyline, or the unimpressive AI and underpowered weaponry. Forget how the title looked; the game itself was simply not fun to play.\n\nThe AI is flat-out laughable. Pre-patch, it was possible to walk up to one of the eponymous monstrosities and punch them to death. Even after being patched, it was not uncommon to see the dreaded xenomorphs of the franchise ignore targets to chase their own tails. They inspired no fear whatsoever. The human enemies were far more of a threat, but only because they could attack from range and thus had a greater opportunity to actually hit you.  The primary change made to the AI by the patch is that their attacks inflicted more damage, but the actual AI routines remain predictible.\n\nThe story and setting are forgettable at best, and insulting at worst. It flat out contradicts the franchise's canon in a poor attempt at a surprise twist. The characters are uninteresting and the voice-acting was poor, despite the use of known actors such as Michael Biehn, who half-heartedly reprises his role as Cpl. Hicks from the movie Aliens. The soundtrack is utterly unnoticable, and failed to inspire any emotion or excitement whatsoever.\n\nI could go on. The animations of the characters - aliens and humans alike - border on the pathetic. The weapons lack the power we expect from guns that carry names such as "pulse rifles" or "smart guns", and anyway ammunition is in such short supply that you'll rarely get to use them to full effect anyway. The level design is linear and crowded, and - except for the rare setpiece - rarely offers anything appealing to look at. There's not enough variety in weapons or enemies to keep things entertaining, and most objectives are little more complicated than "walk over there". There are a few highlights - one level has you stealthing through a sewer of sleeping aliens - but this is the rare exception.\n\nStill, the game is not entirely hopeless, especially for fans of the franchise. Revisiting the (virtual) sets of the second movie has great appeal, and it was hard for me not to get excited when I crawled through the ruins of the Hadleys Hope colony, the ductwork of the Sulaco or visited the dead "Engineer" seen in both Alien and Prometheus. There were rare moments of terror and adrenaline rush when facing down a horde of xenomorphs. And I never get tired of hearing the scream of an alien or the chattering roar of the pulse rifle.\n\nStill, is that enough to save the game, much less recommend it? Sadly, no, on both counts. Aliens Colonial Marines has its moments but they are too far apart and too interspersed with ineffectual gameplay to make for a fun experience. It may not deserve the entirity of the wrath that has descended down upon it, but neither should it garner much praise.\n\n\n\n\n","November 25, 2013","false","28.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I was apprehesive to try this given the "bait and switch" gearbox pulled and the gripes with the AI and graphics, but actually I was pleasently suprised when I actually played it.  The aliens move more or less realistically and combat is actually pretty challenging.  My main complaint is the Ally AI as they have a tendency to move ahead too quickly and leave you hangning to take on hoards of Xenos on your own.  While this is very fitting to the nature of the Aliens film, it's frustrating in a game context because the AI is invincible and can barrell through a hoarde of xenos to rip a door and leave you a mile back trying to catch up.

Set after the Aliens movie, it allows you to revisit film locations and brings back film characters (with their original voice actors) for another round against the xenomorphs. The levels are atmospheric, there are plenty of collectables and a choice as far as weapons and mods go. The story helps to fill in a few gaps and tie up some loose ends, but ultimately tells it's own standalone story. There is a multitude of easter eggs for film fans and gamers alike.\n\nPros:\n•	Atmospheric visuals and a wonderful soundtrack.\n•	Movie references everywhere!\n•	Excellent xenomorph animation.\nCons:\n•	Required extensive patching to be enjoyable.\n•	Short story (although DLC is available).\n•	Limited choice of weapons and upgrades.","July 7, 2014","true","21.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Purchased it in sale and to be honest i was pleasantly suprised.\nPlayed it from the start on hard level and the difficulty made it a decent game, play on anything less and too easy. I loved the levels straight out of film although the consol like textures let the visuals down. Story line bearable and I found the variation pretty good and i loved the level without wepons and keeping quiet. Yes its not the game its hyped up to be but give it a chance and its a reasonable game in a fantastic aliens film like setting. Queen was far too easy to beat and the end and was a bit of an anti-climax.\nAgain play on hard and you will enjoy it.","July 8, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game faithfully recreates the atmosphere from the movie Aliens and I really felt like I was experiencing the world of Aliens in the eyes of a Colonial Marine soldier, which was all i wanted. Although the story is kind of cliche, and the main character and companion NPCs do not get fleshed out enough in terms of character development. But asking for award winning story-telling in an fps action game seems a bit unrealistic. Perhaps when James Cameron makes an Aliens game we can have that :D\n\nWhere the game does shine is in the multitude of authentic weapon models  and their mods, for example you can attach scopes, stock, ammo types, magazine extension, grenade launcher and flamethrower on one of your many primary assault rifles like the iconic pulse rifle or secondary weapon like the pump-action shotgun that appeared in the film etc.. What is more, you also get the chance to use the iconic motion tracker and smartgun in intense climatic game sequences, just like it is in the film. All the weapons seem painstakingly modelled according to how it appeared in the movie Aliens. Graphics and FXs are generally well done and the variety of level designs are also pretty authentic that playing the game will give you frequent flashbacks of scenes from Aliens.\n\nTo be sure, the enemy AIs can be unresponsive at times. Aliens can get stuck between game objects and cease to move, but I have only encountered this less than a handful of times, one of which was when i was fighting in the iconic power loader. The monster got stuck on top of a crate and I think I was only able to killed it because of that bug :D  Some people say the voice work is bad, but maybe it is just the cheesy dialog, but then again the dialog in Aliens is pretty cheesy too. All in all,  I think the game got the feel of Aliens right. If you are a fan of the movie Aliens this is the game for you, just don't expect award winning story-telling, tho i wish :D","June 19, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Go watch Aliens instead... you will have a pleasant 2 hours or so. If you choose the game, you will probably waste more time on a completely average game with some rare high points and mostly lows. The story is very generic, has too few aliens and too much CoD-type shoot-outs. The graphics is so-so, though in 2013, I would expect character models to be a billion times better (even with the patches). The gameplay quickly turns into Call of Duty - Some planet with Monsters edition, minus the new ideas that you sometimes got in CoD. Overall, whatever could be messed up in the creative department, Gearbox managed to mess up. Thanks Randy Pitchford for repeatedly saying, how much you care.\n\nIf you like shooters, and do not insist on having multiplayer (as nobody plays anymore, even though it was kinda decent in parts), this game may still be for you. It does not do shooting badly... only it does not do much else. If you like Aliens fan fiction, so much so that you do not mind not-so-good writing (a somewhat uninteresting story in the Aliens universe, if I wanna be generous to this game), this game might have some nice parts for you. Also, the expansion adds quite a bit. If you like sci-fis, and are bored out of your skull, and do not mind wasting some money to try this game, it is probably a better alternative than staring at your wall (depending on what is on your wall, of course).\n\nI am a huge fanboy of Aliens and was thoroughly disappointed by this game, and quite honestly, started to really hate Gearbox for making it like this. (Check the internetz for the stories around development, if you like.) The game may not be as bad as it looks for people who liked Aliens - you might get a few good hours of play out of it if you did not.\n\nIn addition, the BugHunt multiplayer mode was quite decent, and for some time, it is fun to play the story in co-op as well. Unfortunately, these days nobody plays multiplayer so only consider this if you have friends who also have the game.","June 28, 2014","true","65.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Has the syphilis finally driven him over the edge?" Well, yes and no (I hope), but you should still consider this game despite all the negativity sourrunding it.\n\nCall this a "recommendation of spite". ACM isn't a game I would normally recommend. It isn't even a particulary good game by 2013 standards. (It would have been an excellent shooter by 2003 standards). But it is not the desaster people claim it to be. Not anymore, anyway. The game you will get now is not the game that got released back in march. They patched a lot of the biggest issues out of the game.\n\nNow, what makes the game special? Well, if you are part of the demographics that sports a y-chromosome you love the movie Aliens. You cannot "not love" this movie, it only means you haven't seen it often enough. Yet. And that game is just one long love letter/nerdgasm to the Alien franchise. The continued references to the movies are one of the biggest draws of this game. (mostly to Aliens, but also Alien, Alien³ and Prometheus. Which, btw are all the Alien movies ever made. No other movies were made. None. Full stop.) And they really did their homework. Sometimes even referencing stuff that was only in the script but never filmed. They even throw some nods towards the (most excellent) '90s Alien comic books (or graphic novels, as the fancy pants like to call them nowadays). This, combined with the unmatched sound effects and music of the franchise, makes this game a dream come true for the twelve year old in me that fell in love with the movie.\n\nUnfortunately, that is also just about it, when it comes to the good parts of this game. Combat is decent, but not spectacular. Level "art design" is perfect, right out of the movies, Level "gameplay design" is literally ten years behind. The story is not bad per se, but they overdo the nerdgasm part a pit in the end, shattering the suspension of disbeliev like the chest of XO Kane during dinner. The game is also very short, even if you are going collectables hunting.\n\nAll said and done, I was very happy to check out the game despite the bad reputation, but I am also glad I only paid 10$ for it.\n\nTL:DR. An average shooter which plays (and sometimes looks) like it was made ten years ago.

After writing my Alien: Isolation review and looking at how much I trashed this, I decided to speak the truth about Aliens: Colonial Marines.\n\nFirst things first - Colonial Marines isn't a horrible game, but it isn't quite great either.\n\nWhat it does do right is be a game about the United States Colonial Marines, as well as being a followup of Aliens. The story makes some, but not much sense, and the characters are like weak polyps compared to the cast of Aliens. Perhaps my favorite thing to make fun of is the recurring theme/phrase of "We don't leave Marines behind!", which I guess is supposed to sound heroic, badass and macho, but it sets up the pins for the ending to knock down. (The ending is actually really funny because of this, but I'm not going to spoil it.)\n\nThe gameplay could most certainly use some third-party modifications from sites such as moddb.com, or any other sites that might have good mods for this game (in fact, message me and tell me if you find some good ones). The gameplay is beyond too easy, and as Angry Joe describes, if it weren't for scripted moments and moments where you have to kill all of the enemies to progress, then you "could completely run through entire levels in less than five minutes; ignoring Aliens along the way, never firing a shot, and still win." My recommended perscription is the "Survival" mod on the aforementioned website, since it makes the hardest difficulty a true challenge that made me die more times than Alien: Isolation did. The Aliens can potentially perform finishing moves on you at full health, and acid is absolutely fatal. (It also gives you a classic pulse rifle with the original appearance and a proper 95-round capacity.)\n\nMultiplayer is also pretty cool, since unlike Aliens vs. Predator, you can unlock mutations, perks, traits and stuff for both Marines and Aliens, who both level independantly of one another. And like in AVP, you are able to personalize both species; for Aliens you can do things like change the design of your head, the color of your carapace, and your fatality (do you want to puke acid all over his face, or his heart?), and for Marines it's pretty much like Make-A-Marine Workshop, "Where Badasses are Made" - different heads, voices, camouflage patterns, pouches, knives, helmet attachments, decals for your helmet, shoulders and chest, and much, much more that really can't be described perfectly.\n\nSo if you want to leisurely shoot through sci-fi's most infamous serpent with acidic blood and spring-loaded jaws, or have a Call of Duty experience for a cheaper price, then this is a pretty good game to play; though if you want a great Aliens experience closer to the films, play all of the AVP games as well as Alien: Isolation.","April 19, 2015","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It's not a high end, maximum graphic type game.\nHOWEVER, what the game does have is gameplay that keeps you highly entertained and that's what I paid for.\n\nThe COOP is perfect, arming 4 Marines in a war against Aliens and mercenaries. The weapons upgrade system is minimal but leaves you feeling satisfied when add new attachments and skins to your guns.\n\nThe A.I. isnt terrible and on the Ultimate Badass it's quite fun with 4 people waging war against the Aliens.\n\nI do not have the DLC's however I am told they only make the game better than it already it is.\n\nLong story short, people give this game a bad rap because they are expecting a major title type game. That just isnt the case here, but rest assured, it's a fantastic game and I'd pay for it again if I had a do-over. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a highly addictive and action packed COOP game.\nPosted: December 28, 2013.","May 26, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Yet I took my time for a playthrough.\n\nHere are my Observations:\n\nThe Game features awesome locations, good voice acting, quality storyline and some very good graphic effects.\nYou get to visit several locations known from The Prometheus/Alien-Lore, and you encounter several well known movie-characters. Weapons and Upgrades are a neat addition to the armament known from the movies. You get the chance to collect several "rare" weapons from the characters involved in the Aliens-Movie. Sound FX are awesome as well!\n\nThe entire single player campaign can be played in Co-Op.\n\nWhat I did like:\n> Gameplay in most situations was fast paced, adrenaline pumping straight forward.\n> The Aliens looked very good; also the new (spoiler) Alien lifeforms fit perfectly into the lore.\n> The Maps/levels were as good as it gets for the limited terrain (A Colony on a Planet, and SpaceShips)\n> about 9hrs to complete the Campaign is enuf, yet not too much.\n> Awesome GFX & SFX\n> Coop Campaign.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n> Sometimes, the AI was pretty dumb. Counts for friendlys standing in your way as well.\n> Repetitive gameplay\n> The beginning full of scripted sequences; something I personally do not like.\n> Bossfights were borderline stupid\n\n\nOverall I will recommend this game.

If you make the effort to read the community pages and mod this up (have a look in the .ini files, you'll find all kinds of gfx options that are locked out originally) you will probably find a bit of enjoyment here, particularly if you are an Aliens fanboi/fangrrrl. Multiplayer seems to still work decently as of Feb 2014 which is something I certainly couldnt say for the abysmal PS3 version. The last patch on PC also seems to have fixed a lot of the ludicrous AI issues that plagued it when it first came out, and if you apply all the mods correctly its not an awful looking game at all with Bloom / HDR etc enabled. It just makes you think "what if they had actually got their act together in the first place?"\n\nA missed opportunity for sure but worth a punt in the sub-£5 category and if you can be bothered to download a couple of the small mods and do some .ini file tinkering.","February 19, 2014","true","18.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

(In fact, I actually own it on  console just for the CE. Picked up the PC version for $1.99, because quite simply, I'm much better at FPS on a PC than console... The CE had to be mine, as I grew up a HUGE Aliens fan, as a kid of the 70s and 80s, and had to add it to my Aliens "display o' goodies")\n\nThe game itself is far from great, but it's certainly not horrible, either. I didn't get to playing it before the giant patch they released, but what I have played is certainly passable.\n\nGraphics are decent, but I'm not a huge "graphics guy," as long as the gameplay is at least solid. And ACM is a game that delivers some decent gameplay.\n\nMuch like Duke Nukem Forever, the game's greatest fault lies in all the hype and desire over years of public want. (Of course, Gearbox's famous "gameplay video" shown certainly created some ill will.) There's nothing here that does the game greatness, nor have I found anything that makes it truly falter, either. Sure, it feels and looks a little dated, but does that break it as a game? No. Are there some really fun moments? Yes. Is most of it just standard FPS fare that you can find in most budget titles? Yes.\n\nThe use of the Aliens license is a double edged sword. As an Aliens NUT, there's some real fun when boarding the Sulaco and stumbling across Bishop's lower half, seeing the grating pulled up from where the Queen stalked a crawling Newt. It's fun walking through Hadley's Hope, entering Operations and seeing the aftermath of the Colonial Marine's last stand, from blown through ceiling tiles the Aliens swarmed through, to the floor where Hudson was pulled down to his demise. It's fun finding the sentry guns. Fun finding Newt's doll's head or the final resting place of PFC Hudson. You can tell there WAS, in fact, a lot of love for the Aliens saga thrown into this game.\n\nBut, it also hurts it... Don't ask too many questions of how most of Hadley's Hope is still intact when a major plot device of the movie was how quickly they needed to leave before being vaporized. There are plot holes here you can drive a truck through, and Gearbox does the one thing I cannot stand... Introduce "new" types of Aliens w/ nary an explanation. (Maybe I'm being too critical, and I believe I'm just a touch over half way through the story... Perhaps there's some sort of explanation given at some point...) But if you're going to get the license and rally around how much you respect the fiction involved, please don't allow the inner fanboy to start throwing things in there just to throw things in there. (While the Xenos typically gather some traits from their hosts.... Alien 3s 4 legged variety being an example,) what the heck led to walking time bomb Aliens? If the game is going to be considered "canon," (as has been stated in interviews before the game's release,) PLEASE show it some respect and stick to the "rules." (Ummm... so only the Marines on the Sulaco carried pulse rifles with "extended" magazines? Even extended, in the game, it doesn't carry the 99 rounds featured in the movie. Feels like a forced way to add more tension when you need to constantly reload.)\n\nI would also make the suggestion to use this game with SweetFX and locate in their community a fanamde preset entitled "Aliens Colonial Marines Almost Demo." It makes the game look, IMHO, pretty great via presets, and adds a bluish hue consistant with the James Cameron film.\n\nIf you're an Alien nut, you'll probably enjoy the game and many of its tributes to the classic while also driving you a little crazy as to some of the plot holes. I've found it to be good in nearly every category, but never crossing over into great. Everything is just... So standard.\n\nIf you're just looking for a FPS, I couldn't recommend unless it's on a deep discount. The $1.99 I paid for it to play on a system I'm more comfortable with was a steal, as far as I'm concerned, even owning it already. Sadly, you can probably find other FPSs cheaper that offer the same experience... A mostly average shooter.\n\nIn a score term, I'd have to give it a 65%...

Everyone knows the amount of hate this game is having everywhere. Reviewers didn't like it, and players didn't like it either... Although i feel most of those players talking about how bad this game is, probably didn't even try it. The question everyone asks is this: Is A:CM really that bad? The answer my friends, is yes and no.\n\nThis is a very straight forward, linear shooter. Objectives are simple, aliens are dumb (terrible AI in the sense that they always run at you, with no strategy other than eat your bullets), humans are annoying to deal with and you are incredibly overpowered with all the weapons you can carry with you at all times. The only way this game will challenge you a bit is on the Ultimate Badass difficulty.\n\nA lot has been said about the visuals, but having played this game maxed out my opinion is that the game looks good, if not great. There is the occasional low rez texture, but the PC version at least manages to look above average. The unreal engine is a well proven juggernaut in the games industry, so the engine is not the problem. The lazyness of the developers is, but only in some aspects of the game world. It could have looked a lot better (no out of the box Direct X 10 or 11 support... Gearbox what's wrong with you...), but as it stands this game looks ok, and in some parts it looks great.\n\nI feel the gameplay is a lot like COD. Depending on who you ask, it may be a bad or a good thing. In my opinion the gameplay is fine, the game is fast and the shooting mechanics are simple to master. Most fans of shooters like Crysis, Far Cry or Battlefield will more than likely hate the gameplay of Colonial Marines.\nIt is a very simple game for today standards.\n\nHaving said that, if you are an Alien fan, you will most definately enjoy this game, and possibly even love it. The details and fan service from the alien franchise are top notch. There are tons of references and visual cues from that beloved franchise. But the game itself falls flat in it's ambitions, and it is certainly not the Aliens sequel we were promised. The story is wonky and doesn't make much sense, but it's ultimately serviceable. Multiplayer is fun, providing you play with players from your own rank. It can be incredibly unbalanced due to the level up system, but stick with it and you will have some fun.\n\nIn conclusion, i would only recommend this game as a must buy if you are a truly hardcore Aliens fan. The game is flawed, it lacks the tension from the Aliens franchise, and it won't scare you much, if at all. Some moments in the game do make you feel you are in the movie, but these are few and far between.\n\nIf you are undecided about this game, or if you are a shooter fan, chances are this game will be too linear for your taste, and it is not much of a challenge. If you can try the game somewhere before buying would be best. I know most people are hating on this game, but I am having a great time playing it. It is a very decent shooter, but we were all expecting a great one... And great Colonial Marines is not.\n\nI would rate this game a 6.5 out of 10\n\nThe Good\n\n-Environments true to the movies;\n-Plenty of fan service;\n-Some (few) aspects of the story\n-Co-Op;\n\nThe Bad\n\n-Wonky AI at times\n-Unbalanced Multiplayer\n-Low quality textures in unexpected places;\n-Linear","February 24, 2013","true","131.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","10"

Everything you have probably heard about this game's quality is true. The graphics are nowhere near as stunning as they were portrayed to be in the early tech demo and the promotional screenshots (although the huge post launch patch did improve them vastly). The Alien and human AI (both your partners and enemies) gargles galactic balls, as either group often gets hung up in door ways or on props. The shooting feels very underwhelming, as most weapons lack an appopriate oomph, and aside from the pulse rifle they all are very underpowered damage wise. There is absolutely no atmosphere or tension in this game, save for one borderline genius level around a quarter of the way in. It's sad to see that a game that just came out a few years ago was unable to conjure up the same exhilaration and tension that AvP2 was able to over a decade ago. If you shop online frequently and love Aliens/tolerate or like Predator, then I highly recommend Aliens Vs. Predator 2, the game not the terrible movie. That game has a brilliant intertwining campaign told from 3 different perspectives, as well as genuine terror and tension, combined with sharp gunplay and mechanics. Very little fluff either, which Colonial Marines packs in en masse. I would avoid this game unless steeply discounted, and even then you probably will be disappointed unless you download the recent overhaul mod a dedicated fan released. Better quality work in a free mod than this corporate produced turd.","May 18","false","13.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

With a developer such as gearbox attached to the the project, hopes were high for this FPS release..  Fans of the Aliens series were promised a true sequel to the James Cameron classic, and gamers were promised a cinematic, intense survival experience.  Early gameplay looked very promising, but Colonial Marines disappoints on almost every front.\nPresentation\nThe campaign places you in the shoes of Corporal Christopher Winter, a member of a search and rescue team sent in to investigate the U.S.S. Sulaco after the events of Aliens.  The setup is decent enough, but the story is nothing special, but no doubt veteran Aliens fans will want to see it through.  The opening cinematic is where the game's problems start.  It contains frighteningly low res texture and some awful lip syncing.  This set the tone for the rest of my experience.  Even running on max setting on a gaming PC, the textures look more like a last gen title rather than a beautiful HD current gen title.  Some of the levels do however have the creepy atmosphere you would expect from an Aliens title.  In regards to the lip syncing, it's mostly terrible.  While the voice acting is good enough, the dialogue just doesn't match the facial animations.\nOne of the only aspects of the presentation I really enjoyed was the sound effects.  The iconic dreadful beeping of the motion tracker and sounds of gunfire are accurate to the movie, and fans will appreciate that.\nGameplay\nThe campaign follows a simple linear level design, and it becomes repetitive very quickly.   After only an hour of gameplay, the game falls back on existing FPS conventions instead of doing anything interesting.  The game fails monumentally to create any survival horror tension by constantly loading the player with loads of ammo.  However, in the sewer level, this mechanic is taken out, and it works much better.  When your guns and immense firepower are taken away, Your really feel vulnerable.  There are a couple of good scares that couldn't have happened if you had access to all your weapons.  It's a shame the whole game doesn't feel like this.\nAnother gripe I had with the campaign is the A.I.  Rarely have I seen a game with artificial intelligence so bad.  Even when playing on the hardened mode, xenomorphs run directly at you and do not approach any situation intelligently.  When the game puts you up against the infamous Weyland Yutani corporation, the difficulty spikes.  Guns guns take you down much, much quicker than any alien in the game can.  It needs some serious balancing.\nIf there is one place where the game shines, its in its multiplayer.  While the standard team deathmatch mode is in place, modes such as escape and extermination provide exciting online experiences.  Escape is a 4v4 game mode with four xenomorphs hunting down four marines moving from point A to point B, while extermination pits four marines in a confined position to hold out as long as possible against four xenomorphs.  The game modes are mostly fun, but the xenomorphs feel terribly underpowered and once again the marines are given loads of ammunition, taking away much of the tension.\nConclusion\nIt's really a shame Aliens: Colonial Marines couldn't be better.  With a developer like Gearbox behind the title, many were given false hope that the Aliens License would finally be put to good use..  Long development times are responsible for many of the games problems.  With lackluster A.I., forgettable gameplay, and downright atrocious visuals, this title is a disappointment to fans of the Alien series and gamers alike.\nFinal Score: 3.75/10\n\nhttp://justinmadore.tumblr.com/post/69131996514/aliens-colonial-marines-written-review-pc","January 19, 2014","false","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've never regarded Cameron's 'Aliens' to be a horror film, its an action film to me. Since this game is based on 'Aliens' I expected an action game, which is what I got. However Colonial Marines has plenty of creepy moments, especially if played alone and with headphones. Regarding the over-arching storyline I don't really care whether every detail in the game matches the films or not, I liked the storyline as it relates to your main character and his team of marines, to me that was more meaningful than the rest.\n\nI also thought the voice-acting was good, although the facial animations were not. I like the weapons and the ways you can upgrade them, and how you are forced to choose between different attributes. I like that the game takes you through a wide range of scenarios and environments, the designs are done really well. The music was also good. My only significant complaint is that the aliens have been "dumbed down" too much on the 'Recruit' level. On the harder difficulty settings they get smarter, or at least more aggressive. That is where the AI becomes good.\n\nI can understand why most people consider ACM a failure since it lacks the superior production quality of a Borderlands game. I can also understand that people who expected a horror game got disappointed since perhaps they view 'Aliens' as a horror film and not an action film. However for someone like me who expected an action game and who is not so picky with graphics and whether or not the storyline is a 100% fit with the films, this was not a failed game.","December 26, 2013","true","16.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Yes it has some flaws and some more after that, However it has come a long way since it's release last Febuary. On top of that the DLC "Stasis Interrupted" is not too shabby in explaining the events that led up to the game. Along with a throw back to Alien 3.

The Multiplayer on the other hand is awsome, my take of that mostly comes from the time i spent with it on the xbox though, I have troble getting a game going on steam. The multiplayer modes of survival, escape and bughunt all do what the campain fails to, in that they give you a difinitive Aliens experience. The tention, the action and the FEEL are all there in the multi player thanks to the aliens being people insted of really poor a.i. . You may ask, but Tora...is bughunt not a coop hord/firefight/me3 multiplayer mode with a.i.? yes and oddly enuff, maybe because it's dlc  the a.i. knows what it's doing there and gives the same great taste of awsome as the rest of the multi player. to rap up, I would recoment if it's on sale or in a bundle it's a great time with friends but DO NOT GET FOR SINGLE PLAYER.

I've never regarded Cameron's 'Aliens' to be a horror film, its an action film to me. Since this game is based on 'Aliens' I expected an action game, which is what I got. However Colonial Marines has plenty of creepy moments, especially if played alone and with headphones. Regarding the over-arching storyline I don't really care whether every detail in the game matches the films or not, I liked the storyline as it relates to your main character and his team of marines, to me that was more meaningful than the rest.\n\nI also thought the voice-acting was good, although the facial animations were not. I like the weapons and the ways you can upgrade them, and how you are forced to choose between different attributes. I like that the game takes you through a wide range of scenarios and environments, the designs are done really well. The music was also good. My only significant complaint is that the aliens have been "dumbed down" too much on the 'Recruit' level. On the harder difficulty settings they get smarter, or at least more aggressive. That is where the AI becomes good.\n\nI can understand why most people consider ACM a failure since it lacks the superior production quality of a Borderlands game. I can also understand that people who expected a horror game got disappointed since perhaps they view 'Aliens' as a horror film and not an action film. However for someone like me who expected an action game and who is not so picky with graphics and whether or not the storyline is a 100% fit with the films, this was not a failed game.","December 26, 2013","true","16.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

So if you play this first, then watch the films, you won’t properly appreciate the fiction behind Alien. Saying that, the game portrays a great and fun survival horror. Campaign is fairly short but still fun, although you'll be sick of seeing aliens by the end. Some maps are pretty badly designed, I found a huge out of map glitch just by walking around some of the rocks that enclose the map, and slipped through a bit of the scenery to get right outside.\n\nBiggest of the game's problems are the various immersion-breaking aspects. Your squad mates are invincible and have unlimited ammo, the former because half the time you can walk straight through them. It is a little distracting to be walking down a corridor and have a fellow marine run straight through you. However bad this may seem though, it is better than babysitting vulnerable AI teammates - nothing is worse than failing a mission because the CPU player got itself killed, or you died trying to bail the dumb CPU out of a tight spot. Enemy AI is a bit dodgy - but this is really no worse than most other first person shooters, so it is unfair to criticise this game for it. Aliens do have a tendency to run at you rather than use the walls/ceiling, but they do drop in behind you enough to create some panic-inducing moments.\n\nHowever, top of the draw is the sound design. Lifting most of the effects and musical score straight from the film helps to create a real Aliens atmosphere. The motion tracker is great and it's only a shame that it doesn't pick up more false positives. The voice acting isn't horrendous plus Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen are used as Hicks and Bishop. The story is just an excuse to keep a sense of urgency about the game and is perfectly fine with a satisfactory ending.\n","March 21","true","11.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, I have now sense recently bought the game on PC on sale with DLC.\n\nAnd my thoughts?\n\n...\n\n\nI think it's a really good game. Maybe it's the patches and DLC that really help the game. Because now we have the Bughunt gamemode, really great HD textures, and new maps to work with. Besides that, the music is great, the weapons are fantastic, the atmosphere is really good, and the campaign isn't that bad, hell, even Soldier difficulty now seems to be more difficult. The bughunt is great because now, you really don't know where an alien is coming. You pretty much HAVE to use the motion tracker and that really helped immerse me into the game's world more. Also, here's my biggest argument or praise is, please bare with me on this... the Alien AI. Again, maybe it was a patch, but the alien AI is fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic. They use the walls, climb on the ceilings like all the time, they hide into ducts and go under the floors, etc. They're AI is great. They really make use of their environment to their full advantage. So props to you Gearbox and SEGA for that.\n\nTry this game out and judge it for yourself. That's what I did. I think it's a really fun game. Is it worth $60? Hell no. Is it worth like $20 or 30$?

Their influence can be seen in the graphics presentation of the game, I am sucking it up :-)\n\nALIEN ISOLATION is coming! Being not the biggest fan of FPS (first person shooters-I prefer 3rd person gaming), I endure most FPS for story sake! I have completed here the single player story and thoroughly enjoyed it, IN ANTICIPATION OF COURSE FOR THE UPCOMING IN THE SERIES!! I was not dissappointed, on the reverse side of the coin I think my FPS abilities have breathed and shown their room for improvement. It was also appreciated knowing this game (ALIENS: COLONIAL MARINES) is an official sequel to the known films (fact)! So I absorbed what I could enjoying as much detail as I could, and also playing it through THAT looking glass! Again I played many (not all) hours of this game on my wall through a projector, THE DETAIL is out of this world!!! Try it, I am so blessed with that!  I can't say it enough! There definitely have been many published comments about the quality of this game (even a lawsuit between Gearbox & Sega), but, I am so excited with the upcoming game I was satsified enough to let it wet my appetite for more. Even thinking of replaying my AVP through! Another game that reminded me of this genre or series (Aliens) was ALIEN RAGE, a lot like this game, a worthy quench for more of this sort of thing indeed! Ok, ok, this review is slanted on the single player mode (for which I personally endure FPS-mode-games), there is also a multiplayer mode with DLC and maps for that.

However, I have now sense recently bought the game on PC on sale with DLC.\n\nAnd my thoughts?\n\n...\n\n\nI think it's a really good game. Maybe it's the patches and DLC that really help the game. Because now we have the Bughunt gamemode, really great HD textures, and new maps to work with. Besides that, the music is great, the weapons are fantastic, the atmosphere is really good, and the campaign isn't that bad, hell, even Soldier difficulty now seems to be more difficult. The bughunt is great because now, you really don't know where an alien is coming. You pretty much HAVE to use the motion tracker and that really helped immerse me into the game's world more. Also, here's my biggest argument or praise is, please bare with me on this... the Alien AI. Again, maybe it was a patch, but the alien AI is fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic. They use the walls, climb on the ceilings like all the time, they hide into ducts and go under the floors, etc. They're AI is great. They really make use of their environment to their full advantage. So props to you Gearbox and SEGA for that.\n\nTry this game out and judge it for yourself. That's what I did. I think it's a really fun game. Is it worth $60? Hell no. Is it worth like $20 or 30$? Yes yes yes.","November 10, 2015","true","24.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Now mind you my review is based off of going in expecting the ABSOLUTE worst (as all other reviews portrayed the game AS)\n\ni was...pleasently surprised...\n(angry mob before you hunt me down hear me out)\n\nOkay so this game is by no means what the hype led us to believe and from that point the game failed horrible however going in expecting the worse and keeping those reviews out of your head while playing, even you would be surprised. Ill just make my case in the pros and cons, and then finish in the wrap up\n\nPros:\n-design : All areas are very nostalgic and are wonderful recreations of the movie itself. the lighting (albeit nowhere near as awesome as the tech demo/reveal) is well placed and still presents an eerie feeling, especially in the sewers.\n\n-gun feel: the guns feel innacurate at times however you will quickly adjust and feel like a Bad @$$ gunning down the new and improved xenos with a smart gun, shotgun, or even the iconic pulse rifle. (ai has been sorta kinda fixed and the damage they do is...significant. a single xeno can get behind you and eff your armor and health up rather quickly and then jump away making it hard to deal with)\n\n-Voice Acting: the random banter in the audio logs can be funny, even the random bits with the marines are well voiced and provide some fairly decent...i wanna say immersion but...im gonna go with provides a decent experience and conveys each situation fairly well.\n\n-enemy design: The Xeno's are all very well designed including the new species. they look creepy as can be, even intimidating at times. The Raven mission has some of the BEST scares in the game and truly felt like what the entire game should have been. (aside from the bug during the boss fight when you reload the checkpoint)\n\nThats all i can think of for the pros at the moment, onto the cons!\n\nCons:\n\n-Over hyped: The trailers and playable demos at the press events/ conventions got us way over hyped and every single company behind it should be held responsible. blame does not lay soley upon one party in this situation. the devs shouldnt have released it in a broken state, they shouldnt have taken the tech demo/presentation out of the game, and of course the publishers should have used a Quality Assurance team to test the freakin game BEFORE it was released. there was no reason it should have been let out the doors in that state.\n\n-AI: both the marine, WaYu troops, and even the xenos  at times(although they seem to have been improved from launch) all have very horrible ai. at launch the xenos were a joke, thank god they fixed it (as far as i can tell, i see less of them standing around and more actually getting in my face tearing me a new one on Ultimate Badass (only difficulty woth playing) As for the Friendly Marine AI...ha...yeah just go in expecting to do everything one man army style.\n\n-Characters: a few characters shouldnt have been introduced the way they were, we should have been able to build up a relationship before we knew they were doomed and a specific character shouldnt have even been in the freakin game, they died in the movie.\n\n-gun feel?: as i said you will quickly adjust to the way the guns operate however only a few of the weapons are truly worth using at all. the pulse rifle is fantastic, both shotguns are great. smg, br, and even the ar are all rubbish so forget them. Also a personal gripe for me, i wanted to use the smart gun more often, the game wasnt complete easy mode with it (especially on UB difficulty) so i feel we should have been able to use it a little more often. some sections felt like it needed it more than others.\n\n-final boss: tense but at the same time a joke...its too easy once you figure out how to trick the ai (gee another ai problem, imagine that)\n\n\nAnyway, onto the wrap up!\n\nAliens colonial marines is a good buy, especially at $15, however to truly enjoy the game, you need the stasis interrupted and the bug-hunt dlc's Those truly improve the game HOWEVER you should ONLY buy them on SALE!\n\nThis game is hated on far too much, i have played way worse shooters in my life and the only reason people hate on this game so much is they gave into the hype, the company basically lied about what was in the game, and at release the entire game was a total joke. HOWEVER that has for the most part been fixed, atleast in my experience.\n\nPeople will be surprised if they approach this game while ignoring the hype. as i stated before, i came in expecting the absolute worst but...the game really isnt. its by no means the best game ever, it does not truly do the franchise justice, but it is a decent enough addition to any alien fans libray.\n\nThis is an average game, a 5/10 on AJ's score system.\n\nIt is worth a buy ON SALE ONLY, do not pick this game up at full price, the multiplayer is very dead now, so i cannot include that in my review.","November 19, 2014","true","9.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Sure it was garbage upon release but there have been major patches and the quality is acceptable if you buy it on sale. Besides that, Aliens (the 2nd movie) was obviously a spin-off of the first movie and is therefore much more action oriented. If you want some survival horror, go check out (the awesome) Alien Isolation. But that does not mean, that you can't enjoy the 6-7 hours of campaign in Aliens Colonial Marines. I understand that early buyers are frustrated, but buying it now on sale is absolutely worth it.\n\nI recommend it on sale.","February 21","true","6.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I am guessing what they were trying to say is that the way the game looks on the WiiU is as best as it's going to get. They KNEW it was bad.\n\nBefore you decide to buy this game, I would advise you to take a careful look at the screenshots of this game on Steam or elsewhere. Looks good, right? Crisp, sharp, good lightening, decent textures. Well, that's not how the game looks. Either that, or they really did some good work on making the best possible screenshots to deceive the public.\n\nThe fire looks terrible and so does the smoke, the explosions and the water. The textures up close date back to 2004 at least. The broken glass windows break into several small pieces when shot and disappear in mid air. The dead aliens disappear too in their puddle of blood within 4 seconds. It also says the game uses PhysX but I don't see it. I found out that the game is supposed to be using next gen lightening, but I didn't see it either. Actually, I know that cannot be true since this game uses DX9 and the 2010 AVP used DX11. Talk about taking a step back. You can't see your legs but at least you cast a show [with legs].......Courtesy of the Unreal Engine 3 that frankly won't die and that is being kept on life support at this point.\n\nThere's no friendly fire, so when one of your buddies get surrounded by the xenos, then just spray left and right until the last xeno dies. There is no carefulness nor any meticulous shooting involved at all. The ammo is mostly plentiful but fear not! The melee button is there to save the day but more on that later.\n\nParadoxically speaking the 2010 AVP's graphics excel these my a huge margin. I understand it's the different developer but damn! Regardless, both of these games are a far cry from AVP 2 which is still the best game in the "series" and possibly one of the best games ever made (retro-wise, at least).\n\nThe physics are horrendous. The aliens look like they however when they crawl on the walls, but at least they can jump ahead once again (even that looks sloppy especially when they sometimes rotate 180 degrees mid air). When you step on their acid, you don't get hurt. When they rush, you just melee them (like in 2010 AVP) and see a nice little auto-aim animation even if you are six feet away. First you are here, and then you press the melee button and you are right in front of the alien, and the two of you are literally having a boxing match, which you will always win. Remember that from the movie? And when you play on the hardest difficulty and die you just start from the last checkpoint (unlike from the beginning of the level like in AVP 2). When you play without the cross-hair, the red cross-hair still appears when you are shooting the alien. Why? I don't want cross-hair and I don't want the in-built auto-assist either, I'm using a mouse, thank you very much.\n\nAll in all, this game seems to forget that the aliens barely, if ever, attacked in force. They are cunning creatures that hide in the dark, that flank you, that surround you and then attempt to capture you alive if possible. What they do in this game is simply rush you from many directions. There is barely any tension involved. Any build up of anticipation for the next fire-fight is practically nonexistent, because in truth, the xenos are pretty easy to kill. I remember that in AVP 2 two Xenos could take you out on easiest difficulty in seconds. The solution for this game? more xenos. Oh, and don't forget about having to fight waves of human and droid enemies too. Remember THAT from the movie?\n\nCo-op doesn't save the day. There's barely any "Co-Op" to begin with. Just running around, getting into each other's line of fire, and trying to kill as many xenos for experience to use for your next gun, remember that in the movie? Remember the marines being all psyched for the next alien encounter?\n\nI also love it how Steam says it's a 20 GB game making you think that it's gonna be a huge game with rich textures, long campaign and decent multiplayer. However, when you start downloading the game, it only weights around 6-7GB. Watch out, I guess it's gonna be a short campaign! and then...game over, man. I am trying to be funny which is a self-defense mechanism since I have just shelled out $ 50 for this tripe.\n\nThere are also bugs. Sometimes you see human enemy AI stuck. Then when you approach them they start shooting you. When you die and reload the checkpoint those very same enemy AIs are gone.\n\nIn the very least, this is an arcade shooting game, with decent sound, where you get to shoot aliens, and people while upgrading your arsenal, err...right? If you want a better, longer, cheaper and much more interesting campaign, play the Marine Campaign in AVP 2 (2001).\n\nOR, you can wait until they finish that Crysis 2 -Aliens vs Marine mod which will probably be free anyway, so save your money, pickles.\n\n\nP.S. Spoiler or not, the scene with the Marine who decides to blow himself up with a grenade and endanger his friends as well as the ship was really stupid. Way to go, bro, take out your brothers with you.\n\n"Semper Fi, do or die"\n\nI guess DIE.

It can be a lot of fun in co-op campaign and the multiplayer is pretty good too with some interesting game modes and cool mechanics for the aliens to use.\n\nThe story of the campaign is a little underwhelming, although the Stasis Interrupted DLC has a decent story and also helps to explain how Hicks got back to LV426. The main campaign all comes down to a final boss battle which is pretty awful and could really do with some modifications, but it's not the worst thing in the world.\n\nMy least favourite thing about this game is the "boss battle" half-way through the campaign. You have to try and defeat this "Raven" with a powerloader and the mechanics to do so are completely broken. It takes a good few tries to pass this short section and it can get incredibly frustrating even on easy difficulties - it's the closest I've ever been in a game to breaking my controller.\n\nI've played through the game's campaign and multiplayer matches on PC and Xbox 360 and in my opinion the PC version is a lot better than the console release. This is most likely down to the big patch that released after the game's negative reception. The patch mainly worked on fixing graphical stuff, but I think it did do some tweaks to AI as well.\n\nThe best thing about this game is a new mod (hence my updated review) by the name of "TemplarGFX's ACM Overhaul". A modder took it upon himself to spend months working through the config files of the game to rebalance weapons, improve LOD settings and fix up the AI and textures. Playing with this mod enabled, even in the early stages of its development, is a massive improvement to the core game mechanics as well as the graphical side of things. Xenomorphs are actually smart, using the walls and sneaking around instead of just leaping at you to attack. The W-Y soldiers are now easier to kill and are all independent meaning that as soon as one spots you, they don't all spot you. This makes gameplay much more fluid and can allow for you to actually approach sections with stealth making for some interesting alternative survival options. I'm very excited to see what else this mod will do (it's still in early access at the moment) and major thanks to the developer for improving the game significantly!\n\nTL;DR ...

(I still contend that most of the negative reviews were pre-written before release.) Now everyone is butthurt over ACM, going so far as filing lawsuits for false advertising. There are Aliens. There are Colonial Marines. You got what you were promised in the title. Stop whining. It wasn't overhyped, except by gamers themselves. Does the story break the canon? Absolutely. So what?

Even being a fan, the only thing I enjoyed about this game was the basic idea they had for the sequel. The story, at its core, had the potential to be amazing, but crappy dialogue (including voice acting) and a somewhat "rushed" feeling at the end kills what could have been an amazing story.\n\nAs for gameplay, it is pretty much as generic as any first person shooter can get, nothing really revolutionary here. The enemies are weak, especially the aliens themselves. They die in a few bursts from your chosen weapon, even on the hardest difficulty level. If you shoot an alien point blank, the "acid blood" barely causes any damage at all. There are only a handful (and that is probably generous) of moments in the game where you are actually being stalked by the aliens, those are especially fun moments, as short lived as they are.\n\nIn closing, if you're not a fan of the Alien saga then you probably will not enjoy this game in the least. If you are, then you will at least get a glimpse of what could have been, before it was butchered.","December 27, 2013","true","9.5"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

Aliens: Colonial Marines is that kind of game.\nMade by Gearbox Software Corporation\nReleased in 2013 (EU: February 2013)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpoilers ahead.\n\nAliens: Colonial Marines is a direct sequel to James Cameron film Aliens (1986) and takes you back to LV-426 where the Colonial Marines in Aliens were sent. You take the roll of a Marine, Corporal Christopher Winter, and you will discover what happened on the marine ship USS Sulaco and on the surface of LV-426.\n\nLV-426, 'fool moon of Acheron', the planetoid of Alien (1979) where the crew of the USS Nostromo discovered the remnants of a derelict spaceship and a fossilized crewpilot called the 'Space Jockey'. You will discover that 'The Company' ('Wey-Yu' or 'Weyland Yutani'), already mentioned in the film 'Alien' (1979), play a big role in the game.\n\nThe game received a lot of bad reviews. Mainly because of its story, dated graphics and bugs and glitches. Many bad reviews were based on the view that the game didn't create 'the feeling' of being in the Alien Universe. This review will focus on four different parts: story and gameplay, graphics, sound and replayability. The conclusion will give a short summary.\n\n(tip: before you play this game, you should have seen the Alien films and/or played other Alien related games)\n\nStory\nThe story of Aliens: Colonial Marines takes place after the film Aliens (1986) and before Alien 3 (1992). You are Winter, a Colonial Marine. ‘OOORAH!’ You receive orders from Captain Cruz: find out what happened on the USS Sulaco. A few weeks ago, contact with the Marines on LV-426 was lost. They were sent on the USS Sulaco. Together with a female, Leutenant Ripley, they were sent to investigate the colony 'Hadleys Hope' on LV-426. Build by Weyland-Yutani/Wey-Yu. Things go terribly wrong.\n\nThe game starts with a message from Corporal Hicks, a Colonial Marine who survived the Alien attack on LV-426. Only a female called Ripley, a kid named 'Newt' and a synthetic named 'Bishop' survived. The rest of the Marines are K.I.A. Together with a private called 'O-Neal', you discover that the Company/Wey-Yu has its ties in many sectors.\n\nIn the game you make use of many iconic weapons: Pulse Rifle, Smartgun etc. All from the Alien franchise. The game is a FPS ('First Person Shooter') in the Alien Universe. Due to its connection with the Alien franchise, you recognize many locations (and some characters) from the film Aliens. In the game private Peter O-Neal and (later) private Bella work with you together.\n\nThe singleplayer campaign is about six to eight hours long: it depends on the difficulty. Unlike most other FPS titles, you can play with up to four players in singleplayer. This is a cool feature. Both singleplayer and multiplayer can be played with friends. In the campaign, you can unlock challenges to unlock cool skins and other features for your (online) characters.\n\nArtifical Intelligence\nThe A.I. of the game is not that good. Enemies will sometimes stop in front of you or dont move at all. Your company Marines will not always fire on enemy targets. The best thing you can do is fully concentrate on your own character: dont depend on the firepower from your team. Enemies will rush and try to flank you. The complain that the enemy A.I. is 'bad' is just a lie: the difficulty of the game is responsible for the enemy A.I. Try the game on the highest difficulty setting (UB) and you will be surprised. The story of the game is good, its canon and fits into the Alien Universe. You can play the downloadable content to understand the whole story.\n\nMultiplayer\nIf you play multiplayer, you can play a lot of modes. This gives it a high level of (re)playability. The unique feature is to play as the Alien creatures. Rare aliens like the 'Boiler' and the 'Crusher' can be 'unlocked' to play on the different maps. In the different multiplayer modes, you can try and unlock different skins for your alien and for your marine character.\n\nIn-game bugs and screen tearing in singleplayer and multiplayer.\nYes, this is present in the game. Many reviews complained about the bugs and the screen tearing. Its a minus, but not a very big one.\n\nGraphics\nMany reviewers said the graphics are 'crap' or at least 'very bad'. Indeed, they are not as good as 'Crysis 3' or other high-end PC games. Compared to 'AVP' from 2010, they are different, perhaps not as good on maximum, but 'good enough', 'unique' in my opinion.\n\nBut why play 'Aliens' games to enjoy high end graphics? Its a game (and a movie) about a dark setting, with a focus on atmosphere and raw action. Not all gamers are born in 2013: they didnt know about high end graphics on their SNES but enjoyed and loved games how they are.\n\nRemember 'Aliens' came out in 1986. This is the second film, not the first one. This game represents that 1986 setting. When you come across LV-426 and the Derelict Spacecraft, you see the graphics are not that bad. They are just different with a unique touch. Its raining on LV-426 all the day and you see the water on your screen, the light effects are very nicely done in this game. You look up into the sky on LV-426 and you see vulcanic activity and smoke.\n\nThe character models look not that good, but good enough. Better then average. Yes, you can go right through them, but is that 'crap'? The only thing that is a minus are the facial expressions: they are 'robotic' with no emotions at all.\n\nThe Xenomorphs look good. They crawl and jump right toward your screen and bleed green acid. They have a 'better then average' level of detail. The enviroments look very good, from Hadleys Hope to the dark basement of the colony. Weapons look graphically 'good enough' and represent the different weapons in the movie franchise.\n\nSound\nThe sound of this game is very good: its straight from the films. The sound of a firing Pulse Rifle, Smartgun, or Pump Shotgun represent the sound of the weapons in the movie franchise. The sound of the characters is good. The voice of Lance Henriksen is present in the game and other actors from the film 'Aliens' were responsible for the in-game voice sounds.\n\nThe sound in environments is good. It gives you a sense of a dark place far from the earth. Desolated and abandoned. The sound in the colony is realistic: it gives the game a ‘dark feeling’. The Alien creatures scream just like in the movie.\n\nReplayability\nReplayability of the game is high because of the many offline and online options. You can customize your weapons, create your own marine and create your online Alien creature. The game has many online modes to offer: TD, Escape, Survival, etc. Other downloadable content is available.\n\nConclusion\nAliens: Colonial Marines is a game that is loyal to the Alien franchise. A FPS title, related to the film 'Aliens' from 1986 with 'action-horror' elements. Due to the multiplayer online feature, the chance to play the Alien creatures and the co-op feature in singleplayer, this game is fresh and innovative. Its just different then the most FPS titles like Call of Duty or Battlefield. If you are a FPS player with no interest in the Alien franchise, this game is 'average' to 'good' (6/10 or 7/10). If you like the Alien franchise, or played a lot of 'Alien related games', you know this game is not a bad game. If you are a big fan, just like me, you will love this game.\n\nIf you haven't seen the Alien movies, go watch them first.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe good\n* Sound;\n* Atmosphere;\n* Co - op.

It's not a high end, maximum graphic type game.\nHOWEVER, what the game does have is gameplay that keeps you highly entertained and that's what I paid for.\n\nThe COOP is perfect, arming 4 Marines in a war against Aliens and mercenaries. The weapons upgrade system is minimal but leaves you feeling satisfied when add new attachments and skins to your guns.\n\nThe A.I. isnt terrible and on the Ultimate Badass it's quite fun with 4 people waging war against the Aliens.\n\nI do not have the DLC's however I am told they only make the game better than it already it is.\n\nLong story short, people give this game a bad rap because they are expecting a major title type game. That just isnt the case here, but rest assured, it's a fantastic game and I'd pay for it again if I had a do-over. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a highly addictive and action packed COOP game.","December 28, 2013","true","9.6"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","0"

Gameplay-wise it was surprisingly fun, the mechanics are a little unpolished and the graphics might not be the best, but it's still a very fun game. Personally, the only real issue with the game is what it could of been. The addition of the motion sensor gives the game a very horror feel that it just doesn't really have. The parts where you have to fight against human enemies seem to really turn it into just another shooter. As just an FPS compared to today's FPS's it really falls flat on it's feet. But, if you take into effect the attempt at adding in horror it makes it a somewhat enjoyable experience. Personally, I feel that they should have pushed the horror all the way through. Where instead of having to deal with multiple aliens that die relatively easily I should deal with less aliens that die much harder and have better AI. Instead of running towards me like a demented alien clown trying to hug me to death they should hide like the first encounter, only coming out of the shadows to swipe at you or jumping at you and melting back into the shadows. Then, as a you play you have to constantly, have your motion detector out as you tensely look for aliens. The way it is now is simply depressing. But, despite all of that it's still a pretty enjoyable game and work the 5 bucks that I spend on it.\n\ntldr: Buy aliens:colonial marines, at 5 bucks its still a pretty fun fps and worth the money.","August 30, 2013","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Remember that PC Doom 2 mod?  Alien TC (Stood for Total Conversion as they called mods that virtually replaced all game content with something new)  I believe this was the first 'Aliens' style FPS experience back in the 90s, then the Atari Jaguar had a good Aliens Vs. Predator game, but it was kind of hokey and not so atmospheric as the previous mentioned.  Buncha sprites bouncin around and weird view angles.  Basically what I'm trying to say is since I was 12 I've been enraptured by the idea of meshing the FPS experience with the Aliens universe.  I've played em all, and lots of multiplayer for each.  Sure this game had a few bugs, but the reviews it got were simply unjust and mostly from players that never really gave it a chance.  This is actually a hidden gem and the most complete and modern, well designed Aliens first person shooter experience you're gonna get. Playing the Coop with a friend, we actually felt like marines, one guy with a smart gun, one guy holding the motion detector, sharing quietly what the radar blips are saying.  All in the dark recesses of ships trying not to wake the bugs, or facehuggers.  Which you better shoot off your friends face quickly when it laches.  Anyhow it just works.  It was a solid game, the Aliens are terrifying for once as well.  Never had any horrible game bugs ruin my experience as they say.  The film grain issue was indeed bs though.

I absolutely loved the game and everything about. I pre-ordered the game, the only game I have pre-ordered or even spent more than $20 on steam and it was absolutely worth it! If you enjoy the Alien franchise and fun first person shooters this is the game for you.\n\nTrue the game is flawed and not perfect, and the multiplayer match finder is incredibly bad. However there is no greater thrill being one of four colonial marines with your friends in an abandoned starship watching your motion sensor beep at the oncoming aliens. Setting up sentry turrents, running out of ammo, losing squadmates along the way, welding doors. It's all a blast!\n\nMy particularily favorite game modes are Escape, Survival and Bug Hunt. However due to the smaller player base now and the terrible match finder the first two game modes mentioned (escape survival) are almost impossible to set up.\n\nI do believe this game was rushed and I also do believe it could have been significantly better; however when I look at my steam library there are far and few games that jump out and scream play me on LAN night.

After putting 12 hours into this game so far, I feel I can comment on it.  I will be blunt and say there is alot that disapointed me with this game, the graphics and lighting are bad compared to the "in game" footage Gearbox showcased to us several months back so it is understandable why so many fan were frustrated with the look of this game.\n\nThe game AI is buggy and frustrating at times, and the NPC that "escorts" you through the game can spoil the atmosphere on occation due to his imortality and sometimes oblivious AI, he sometimes looks like he is on some moonlight stroll in the park.\n\nThe multiplayer part for me is anoying, the 3rd person Alien perspective just does not function well at all, and could really do with being changed to a more traditional first person perspective alien experience.\n\nI was really pleased with a plot twist in the game that although not perfectly explained and implemented, was able to undo some of the damage done by the Alien 3 movie... details of which I wont mention here so as not to spoil the surprise.\n\nProblems aside... On Hardest mode with a few friends that campain is alot of fun and the game is growing on me.  I hope a few patches will come that will correct some horrible glitches but for me its bad.... but not as bad as some reviews state.\n\nIf you can snag this game on sale, buy it, it's fun with friends.\n\nI rate AvP Colonial Marines at 6/10 points lost for misleading demo footage and buggy AI.","February 15, 2013","true","111.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

With that said, this game wasn't as bad as reviews would make you originally think, but it is definitely medicore - no doubt about it.\n\nPositives:\n-Sound effects are great, such as the pulse rifle.\n-Lighting effects and positions in the levels can create a moody atmosphere.\n-Alien models look good.\n-Movie locations recreated in-game look faithful.\n-Characters are okay, not great... but okay. Bella is annoying though. Gearbox tried to make O'Neal the player's companion but unfortunately they didn't give him enough dialogue to make him memorable.\n-Legendary weapons are a cool idea, and the game does have a few collectibles if that is your thing.\n-Some of the levels are fun and unique, such as the sewer level.\n\nNegatives:\n-The player fights more human enemies than aliens, which is stupid as hell.\n-AI is terrible! Aliens will take forever to react to you and even then they just mindlessly charge towards you without even taking alternate routes (such as walls or roofs). Sometimes aliens will just stand still while you blow their acidic brains out.\n-The gunplay is so boringly mediocore in this game, you literally just spray your weapons at enemies hiding behind cover hoping some of your bullets randomly hit.\n-Game is way too easy even on the hardest difficulty.\n-Level design is way too linear, you pretty much run at a straight line hip firing towards cardboard humans with no intelligence and repeat every level.\n-Fighting the big alien with the exosuit is a terrible experience. The aliens will run under your exosuit which causes the player to spin around at random that will kill you, over... and over... and over again.\n-Last boss fight is incredibly easy and is a bit of a joke.\n-Voice acting for the aliens character is laughable.\n-So many plot holes.\n-Team mates are completely useless, they shoot peas instead of bullets. They don't help at all.\n\nOverall, this game is incredibly mediocore. I would avoid playing this game unless you're a huge alien fan. Pretty much every other game featuring an xenomorph is better than this. I recommend Aliens vs Predator 1 and 2, Alien Trilogy, Aliens vs Predator Extinction and Alien Isolation. The gameplay is boring, the characters are boring for the most part and the story has more holes than O'Neal's brain.\n\n4/10","March 18","false","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the story is severely lacking in development.  The AI is meh to say the least, and the Reward Systems leave MUCH to be desired.  It really would have been nice if the publisher had updated the Rewards system upon releasing additional content for the game.  The reason being, it would make tracking progress much easier.  The DLC Bug Hunt and Stasis Interupted pretty much MAKE this game.  As much as I would enjoy seeing more content for this game, I'm afraid that is unlikely at this point.\n\nMy suggestion would be to wait for a Steam Sale to purchase this game and any of the DLC.","December 10, 2013","true","52.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's no masterpiece, but it has it's merits. Some of the levels are just fun, particularly 'The Raven' which had a good pacing for the suspence and was entirely focused on xenomorphs instead of the wey-yu. Gameplay is about what you'd expect out of a shooter, though I wouldn't be putting to much stock into your AI companions, to put it frankly they can't shoot worth a damn and when they do manage to hit something it's probably not the target you're wanting them to hit.\n\nThe story is meh. Honestly they could have gone in other directions with it, and seeing as the DLC page spoils it for you anyhow  the fact that it's Hicks and not one of the other marines that may have not actually died on the planet makes me roll my eyes. That being said if you are looking for some mindless xeno blasting then the game will certainly feed that need. I'd recomend playing with friends at hardened or ultimate badass otherwise the enemy AI is only marginally better then your companions.\n\nI'll be honest I've not tried to much of the online component, but there aren't to many people playing so you're not likely to find a team unless you have friends.","December 10, 2013","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I absolutely loved the game and everything about. I pre-ordered the game, the only game I have pre-ordered or even spent more than $20 on steam and it was absolutely worth it! If you enjoy the Alien franchise and fun first person shooters this is the game for you.\n\nTrue the game is flawed and not perfect, and the multiplayer match finder is incredibly bad. However there is no greater thrill being one of four colonial marines with your friends in an abandoned starship watching your motion sensor beep at the oncoming aliens. Setting up sentry turrents, running out of ammo, losing squadmates along the way, welding doors. It's all a blast!\n\nMy particularily favorite game modes are Escape, Survival and Bug Hunt. However due to the smaller player base now and the terrible match finder the first two game modes mentioned (escape survival) are almost impossible to set up.\n\nI do believe this game was rushed and I also do believe it could have been significantly better; however when I look at my steam library there are far and few games that jump out and scream play me on LAN night. Aliens Colonial Marines is an exceptional gem in the Aliens Universe and perfect for any avid fan.","September 9, 2014","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My review will be slanted from the start. I collect books, movies, replicas and movie props from this film - though I love the whole series/universe, Aliens is by far the superior film. Is it a FANTASTIC game ? No, it isn't. Is it even a good game ? Not terribly. It isn't however; a awful as most of the reviews say.\n\nYou are a USCM Marine, you get to use every single iconic weapon in the movie. Though a MAJOR complaint for me was the HORRIBLE INACCURACY of nearly every weapon except the pump shotgun, the Service 9mm and of course the M56 Smartgun. (Hard to miss with IR tracking) The graphics are above average especially since the upgrade patch, and the game IS very atmospheric. Hadley's Hope and The Sulaco are recognizible right down to the name plates on the lockers. Lighting is low and creepy, never knowing where a xeno may pop up.\n\nBringing me to the story, THIS is why people I think are so upset. Many of the games flaws would have been forgiven... (Poor AI, Unfinished textures and serious issues with the NPC's) It feels thin, unimaginative and the ending is extremely ABRUPT and unsatisfying ! Many will be... WTF just happened ? Hick's inclusion while welcome to me I loved the character, but how they did it is just plain RIDICULOUS. They should have collaborated with Jim Cameron since this is considered cannon to the movies.\n\nThe "Stasis Interrupted" DLC is a HUGE improvement over the original game, absolutely terrifyingly atmospheric in places - I greatly appreciated that offering. All-in-all I consider Aliens: Colonial Marines absolutely crucial to my collection, however; with the source material available this game could have been a LANDMARK in gaming.\n\nOverall The game was rushed, and mundane FPS shooter with wonderful graphics but a thin, non-existent story. The ending is abrupt and left wide-open to a sequel which I'm sure was the intention. The Marines look great, the iconic weapons are there... (Even if the you can't hit the broadside of a barn with the pulse rifle) The levels are dark and highly detailed with familiar places and feel to the movies. It's empty though put out to make a buck.\n\nIf you are a Die-Hard like me ? The game is a must-have for your collection. BUY-IT !\n\nIf you're looking for a state of the art FPS with top-notch mechanics and story not caring about the Aliens movie or franchise? Let this title float right under your motion-tracker...\n\nIt's not as terrible as most of the reviews say it is...\n","November 30, 2013","true","47.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enviroment is nice, Charaters a bit ugly but fully ok. I read a review that the ships internals are all look the same: "Man, why should a spaceship look different from room to room???"\n\nSound: Good\n\nHandling: Characters handle well.\n\nDifficulty: "Veteran" could be a bit hard. Starting with "soldier" in a single player campaign is hard enough for most players. If you play Coop Campaign you should raise the difficulty.\n\nLocalization: German loc. has some funny points like "waldmannsheil" and the "ooorah" sounds a bit bored but it is ok. A few funny moments if u accept the "marines" style.\n\nStory: Good and fun to play. When i finished one of the ten (i think) chapters i was always willing to play the next. There are dozens of allusions to the movies (mainly Alien2) and lots of the story plays in the moviesetting. !Spoiler!: The appearens of "Hicks" is completly explained if u listen to the text at chapter seven.\n\nPlaying: All weapons from the movies, which could be adepted to your playstyle. There are six epic weapons that could be found in the campaign. (And again) I read a review that the maps are so linaer: "Man, yes they are!!! If they are not you will found nothing in the game" (btw: They are quite big and if your NPC wont lead the way you will find nothing). Your only may is your motiontacker. This handy device shows you the way. A bit...and it makes no differnence if object are down or above you...\n\nMultPlayer: CoopCampaign and a few versus games. In MP you could fully customizes your Marine or Xeno Character. Really nice...\n\nOverall: Great game (by now). A lot of fun to play for Alien Friends and highly replayable if you have friends that play the game with you.","June 20, 2014","true","42.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is so so, not that i really cared. Its all been done before but was playing this as a huge Aliens fan. To me the game DOES make you feel like your in the Aliens universe. Amazing sounds from weapons and aliens. The motion tracker is awesome but just having it on and listening ..you'll think your watching Aliens....although a pain when you have to switch back to gun before being eaten.

Since then most of the issues that I am aware of have been patched. The Alien AI is better and very lethal. They like to run on the ceiling when you are destracted by their buddies and drop down behind you. I have died many times to this before I adapted. There are a few remaining issues but those are mainly minor irritants. The AI will still get stuck and get left behind at times, but when you reach the objective or checkpoint they teliport to you and carry on as normal. The price right now is $2.99 (80% off steam sale) and during this time it is more then worth the price.\n\nIf you do decide to pick up the game I highly recommend buying Stasis Interupted.

It's a solid game with solid co-op and multiplayer. I don't know why it's become the flavour of the month to hate on this game. Graphically it looks like any other unreal engine game but with the shadows/lighting ramped up (Looks very nice in some areas.)  runs well, and is very playable.  I am enjoying the ♥♥♥♥ out of the co-op and the multiplayer so far, it has a bit of left 4 dead to it in some of the modes.  The game is not perfect however, and at the tim eof writing this (release day.) it's in need of some definite patching, but it's not game breaking, it isn't on the level of Skyrims backward flying dragons, or Fallout New Vegas' and its multitude of crazy bugs.  Ignore the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ metacritic its unreliable anyways, and just try it out for yourself. If you can get it on the cheap (I got it for 32 bucks.) it's worth the asking price for a fan of the Aliens film/franchise.","February 12, 2013","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

(Again)\n\nFIrst lunch no problem at all,  The graphic look decent, HD texture and nice shader. Large world, Long play before loading new map. The sound effect is greats, classic from the movie. Team work is required but not much as L4D. Nice first person animation. Weapons to use is quite enough (As a Marine). We quite disapointed at first look on some weapons. Recommended you to find all legendary weapons, You will love the dev a little bit more (Straight from the movie). The AI is smart enough to kill us all 4 of us. (Ultimate Badass Difficulty). They can dodge, jump away, leaping toward you, surpirse you from behind and  more. We encounter no bug at all except friendly NPC stuck near elevator for about 30 second but only once. AI can lose thier limb too. Story line is fun and can be scary. Turret can be deploy in realistic way. And can you control the classic yellow loader robot like ribly does? Find out your self.\n\nThis game worth 9 bux for us. 7/10   (still hoping for AVP3)\n\nWe think Gearbox might run out of budget or some sort. This game can go even further.\nWell, if you like shooting alien with friend, support the dev and play it with your friend now.","April 28, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The aliens instantly kill you if they grab you on your last health segment and the armor meter goes down pretty fast. On a plus side, there is ammo just about everywhere in a combat situtation (A good tip is to not use your grenades all at once. You only get them from hostile marines).

This game had a HUGE following during its 7 year production and with tech demos and screenshots slowly spoon-feeding its fans and speculative fans, people grew antsy with anticipated glee. However, when they discovered the game was nothing short of mediocre, they deem it as atrocious trash.\n\nPlain and simple: People overhyped the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game into lower reviews than it deserved. This game is actually a lot of fun to play with others, and is MUCH better than all other Aliens games (besides that one from the 90s. That ♥♥♥♥ rocked).\n\nIf you're a huge fan of the franchise, memorized the ♥♥♥♥ out of Aliens as I did where you recall Hudson, Hicks, Gorman, Vasquez, Newt, and all the glorious other characters, you'll have a ball in this game. This game certainly knows to include a ton of easter eggs to enjoy and a lot of familiar sounds to hone in on your nostalgia.\n\nConclusion: JUST as a video game to play I'd say a 5.5/10 due to major glitches, and bad script writing. But personally, I am, and still am having fun with this. I'd say 7/10 for me.","February 14, 2013","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They have their reasons but personally, I have had a ton of fun with this game and 15 hours in doesn't look like it will be stopping.\n\nThe game is canon in the Alien universe, being a direct dequel to James Cameron's Aliens. Some parts of the film where retconned/altered, with the prime example being Hadley's Hope not being destroyed by a nuclear explosion at the end of Aliens. Some hazy explanations are decent enough and you play as Winter, one of the Colonial Marines sent to LV426 to investigate Hick's distress call.\n\nThe game is very linear. The campaign is around 8-12 hours long depending on the difficulty and your tendancy to rush through the vistas of the game. Throughout the campaign you will visit locales in Aliens, whilst blasting through numerous Aliens and Wey-Yu mercs whilst following your NPC companions. You'll be shoehorned in from one set piece to another in the vein of COD. Not necessarily a bad thing as it allows the action to flow and story to be conveyed as the writers intended, but it becomes painstakingly obvious half way through the campaign when the lack of variety is noticeable.\n\nThe graphics are average. There are beautiful vistas and overall the presentation is neat but the texture work is shoddy. However, being spoilt by the DX11 AvP 2010, the graphics leave a lot to be desired. This is incredibly evident in the multiplayer, where the graphics are scaled back akin to the COD4 days. Why on earth they thought this was necessary is beyond me. The ingame options is extensive enough, with bonus points for an ingame FOV slider! The game runs solidly on 60.\n\nWhilst the graphics are good, the animation and AI is lackluster. The Alien itself is a massive culprit of this, with jerky animations of the AvP2 days. What happened to the smooth sneaky killer of AvP2010?\n\nThe multiplayer, whilst shows promise. has some glaring problems which may kill the community for the game. There are no dedicated servers for the game and it uses a COD4 style lobby matchmaking system. I haven't had any problems finding games or issues with lag but it is something to keep in mind. There are 4 game modes and honestly, they are a lot of fun. TDM, Co-op campaign and Survival  are self explanatory. Escape is L4D done with Aliens and is incredibly good fun. Extermination is an objective mode where Marines aim to 'capture' spots on the maps to destroy Alien eggs and Aliens have to stop them. The modes arefun but there is an issue with a lack of maps.\n\nIf you have read this far then you'd think this is a painfully average game and you are right. HOWEVER, the use of the license itself is done very well. There are plenty of fanservice with familar locales and references through the whole game for fans. The game, whilst average, somewhat captures the 20 minutes in Aliens where the Colonial Marines was badass and lives off that. The license saves this game from being meh to decent. If you really liked the Alien franchise, this is a no brainer. You'd appreciate it for what it is. If you didn't like the film, you'll find an average sci-fi corridor shooter.","February 12, 2013","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Remember that PC Doom 2 mod?  Alien TC (Stood for Total Conversion as they called mods that virtually replaced all game content with something new)  I believe this was the first 'Aliens' style FPS experience back in the 90s, then the Atari Jaguar had a good Aliens Vs. Predator game, but it was kind of hokey and not so atmospheric as the previous mentioned.  Buncha sprites bouncin around and weird view angles.  Basically what I'm trying to say is since I was 12 I've been enraptured by the idea of meshing the FPS experience with the Aliens universe.  I've played em all, and lots of multiplayer for each.  Sure this game had a few bugs, but the reviews it got were simply unjust and mostly from players that never really gave it a chance.  This is actually a hidden gem and the most complete and modern, well designed Aliens first person shooter experience you're gonna get. Playing the Coop with a friend, we actually felt like marines, one guy with a smart gun, one guy holding the motion detector, sharing quietly what the radar blips are saying.  All in the dark recesses of ships trying not to wake the bugs, or facehuggers.  Which you better shoot off your friends face quickly when it laches.  Anyhow it just works.  It was a solid game, the Aliens are terrifying for once as well.  Never had any horrible game bugs ruin my experience as they say.  The film grain issue was indeed bs though.  But its a beautiful game, ran well on my older PC even.","June 19, 2014","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've definitely paid more for less with other games.\n\nIf you're looking for a good, balanced review, I can recommend Good Game's from Australia's ABC TV (http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s3688766.htm) is one of the very few balanced reviews I've seen. They called its flaws, but also recognised the positives in its offering. You can watch or read a transcript of the review via the link above.\n\nMy take is this: The game is a good fun FPS in the vein of Left4Dead, and like that game is a lot more fun when played with friends. The visuals are decidedly 2-years-ago in quality, and that's disappointing, but not unforgivable. I have not seen any of the AI bugs mentioned in reviews I've read, which either means I'm blind, incredibly lucky or they've already been patched. The level design is pretty good, and some of the levels are genuinely scary if played on Ultimate Badass (Hope in Hadleys, for example).\n\nPersonally, I think anyone who scored A:CM less than a 6 out of 10 is suffering from a really terrible case of Disappoint that he or she just cannot see past -- or else he or she has seen other influential reviews (e.g. Kotaku, RPS) and jumped on that bandwagon to avoid stigma (many of the reviews reek of the latter, if I'm being honest; as an aside, as an older gamer, I see a "tribalism" in games commentary today that I don't remember existing pre-Internet...a very bad thing, but that's a subject for another time and a whole other rant).\n\n\nSubjective Assessment: 6/10","November 25, 2013","true","58.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My review will be slanted from the start. I collect books, movies, replicas and movie props from this film - though I love the whole series/universe, Aliens is by far the superior film. Is it a FANTASTIC game ? No, it isn't. Is it even a good game ? Not terribly. It isn't however; a awful as most of the reviews say.\n\nYou are a USCM Marine, you get to use every single iconic weapon in the movie. Though a MAJOR complaint for me was the HORRIBLE INACCURACY of nearly every weapon except the pump shotgun, the Service 9mm and of course the M56 Smartgun. (Hard to miss with IR tracking) The graphics are above average especially since the upgrade patch, and the game IS very atmospheric. Hadley's Hope and The Sulaco are recognizible right down to the name plates on the lockers. Lighting is low and creepy, never knowing where a xeno may pop up.\n\nBringing me to the story, THIS is why people I think are so upset. Many of the games flaws would have been forgiven... (Poor AI, Unfinished textures and serious issues with the NPC's) It feels thin, unimaginative and the ending is extremely ABRUPT and unsatisfying ! Many will be... WTF just happened ? Hick's inclusion while welcome to me I loved the character, but how they did it is just plain RIDICULOUS. They should have collaborated with Jim Cameron since this is considered cannon to the movies.\n\nThe "Stasis Interrupted" DLC is a HUGE improvement over the original game, absolutely terrifyingly atmospheric in places - I greatly appreciated that offering. All-in-all I consider Aliens: Colonial Marines absolutely crucial to my collection, however; with the source material available this game could have been a LANDMARK in gaming.\n\nOverall The game was rushed, and mundane FPS shooter with wonderful graphics but a thin, non-existent story. The ending is abrupt and left wide-open to a sequel which I'm sure was the intention. The Marines look great, the iconic weapons are there... (Even if the you can't hit the broadside of a barn with the pulse rifle) The levels are dark and highly detailed with familiar places and feel to the movies. It's empty though put out to make a buck.\n\nIf you are a Die-Hard like me ? The game is a must-have for your collection. BUY-IT !\n\nIf you're looking for a state of the art FPS with top-notch mechanics and story not caring about the Aliens movie or franchise? Let this title float right under your motion-tracker...\n\nIt's not as terrible as most of the reviews say it is...\n","November 30, 2013","true","47.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it's got a lot of problems it's also fun.  Killing Aliens with the pulse rifle never gets boring.  Familiar voices from Hicks and Bishop come back in this sequel to Aliens 3.. at least that's the time line they give us.  Tackling the main game and its DLC will take about 11  hours to beat.  The graphics were decent and the sound effects for all the guns were very nostalgic.  Hit detection was pretty bad.  This game suffers from Counter-Strike syndrome.

First of all this is not a generic first person shooter and it actualy goes away from many things modern fps' do. Like in the game your health doesnt regenerate, you have a limited amount of ammo, and there is a level up and gun upgrading system which is availble for multiplayer AND singleplayer so you can load out your arsonal with however you like and use it on your journy trough the campaign, not just multiplayer. Alot of people complain about the graphics which seemes to be the deciding factor for many games wether its good or not (for some strange reason). Yes the graphics arn't these state of the art realistic looking ones but does that make the game unplayable, NO! So people should look at this game (and all games in general) not for what it doesnt have but for what it does have. I am a HUGE fan of the alien franchise and Ive always dreamed of blowing the head of a xenomorph off with a shotgun anf i was satisfied with this game and what it had to offer for a fan of the series like me. Sure it gets some parts wrong in the story but that doesnt matter all that matters is that you have fun playing it.","January 13, 2014","true","41.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game took a twist off from the movie which left me dumb founded (i won't spoil it for you), but everyone was complaining how the aliens moved, and so on. If you've played an AVP game the aliens pretty much move the same. I never had an issue with the game glitching or so. An to be honest I think people are just complaining at the fact it's an Unreal Engine used, and wasn't made to it's full potential. Which I do have to agree the game could have been made better using that powerful engine, but it's still not a bad game.

After putting 12 hours into this game so far, I feel I can comment on it.  I will be blunt and say there is alot that disapointed me with this game, the graphics and lighting are bad compared to the "in game" footage Gearbox showcased to us several months back so it is understandable why so many fan were frustrated with the look of this game.\n\nThe game AI is buggy and frustrating at times, and the NPC that "escorts" you through the game can spoil the atmosphere on occation due to his imortality and sometimes oblivious AI, he sometimes looks like he is on some moonlight stroll in the park.\n\nThe multiplayer part for me is anoying, the 3rd person Alien perspective just does not function well at all, and could really do with being changed to a more traditional first person perspective alien experience.\n\nI was really pleased with a plot twist in the game that although not perfectly explained and implemented, was able to undo some of the damage done by the Alien 3 movie... details of which I wont mention here so as not to spoil the surprise.\n\nProblems aside... On Hardest mode with a few friends that campain is alot of fun and the game is growing on me.  I hope a few patches will come that will correct some horrible glitches but for me its bad.... but not as bad as some reviews state.\n\nIf you can snag this game on sale, buy it, it's fun with friends.\n\nI rate AvP Colonial Marines at 6/10 points lost for misleading demo footage and buggy AI.","February 15, 2013","true","111.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

First off, the Demo looks WAY BETTER then the finished product, but that is being fixed by Fans with their fancy Mod Skills (THANK YOU). The Story did catch my eye and I did enjoy the story, which picks up and kind of explains stuff after Aliens (2). Don't get me wrong, Aliens 3 does explain what happens but this game puts a twist between Aliens and Alien 3.\nGame mechanics are ok in my opinion but the developer could have done more to intensify the game. I felt like I was using old school controls instead of the games that we play today but the game does have cool gadgets that kind of spice up the game, making you kind of on your toes.\nMultiplayer was AWESOME when it first came out but it has died down quickly and it could not save the entire game. Leveling up your character or alien is fun but with limited matches due to very few people playing it just kills the game and is mostly used for Co-op campaign missions or just singleplayer.\nI would recommend this game for those of your who are interested in the Alien Franchise as it sure was fun for me. Just don't get your hopes up thinking you will constantly be playing this game over and over and over again as the replay value is low.\n\nRate: 5/10","August 30, 2013","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The AI is pretty laughable; the graphics in game/cutscenes are early last gen. But what makes this game so bad is that the developers Gearbox (they made the Borderlands games, Half Life 1 expansions and Duke Nukem Forever) lied and over hyped the game to ridiculous lengths that the previewed game is nothing like the finished product (See E3 videos), the game much like Duke Nukem Forever (also done by Gearbox...) was in development hell for most of the last decade and became vapourware and a bad internet joke. However the finished product here does have a few redeeming qualities to it, it is enjoyable in co-op with friends, the campaign is pretty OK (nothing spectacular to write about), the multiplayer is great (the Aliens have a good control scheme) and the best part is that there is a Left 4 Dead esque co-op/verses multiplayer campaign that is great but is basic. The DLC is OK and is worth a look at (when the Season Pass is cheap).\n\nPros:\n- Good gameplay (OK shooter).\n- Full controller support.\n- Good multiplayer and co-op game modes.\n- Easy Achievements.\n\nCons:\n- Poor game package overall (since this is an AAA game).\n- Graphical not good, considering the E3 trailers on older builds looked better.\n- Crap AI.\n- Multiplayer scene is almost dead, despite it being a redeeming feature of the game.\n\n5/10\n\nTL:DR: Buy this game in a Steam Sale along with the Season Pass along with a few buddies and play through the Campaign/Multiplayer and have a few laughs.","July 1, 2014","true","56.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Aliens: Colonial Marines. There were huge expectations for the game (God knows I've been waiting for it since it was first announced back in what... 2001? 2002?) and at release the game did not exactly fulfil them. Word is it was quite awful ( I picked it up a year after release, so I did not experience the terrible), which was a disappointment to me. However, since then quite a few patches were released that apparently fixed most of the problems. Which is good. Of course it is unacceptable to release a broken mess of a game in the first place, but hell, at least they fixed it. Now what are my impressions of the game? All things considered I really enjoyed the time I spent playing A: CM. The campaign lacked the specific 'Oompf' I like to see in games, but otherwise the game is OK. The AI might not be stellar, but it's on par with what we can see in other Alien-universe games. The Xenomorphs are fairly deadly, and the guns are quite satisfying to use.\nAs for the accusations of the certain plotholes... it's not as bad as people make it to be. Sure the explanation COULD be better, but otherwise it works for me.","March 31, 2014","true","12.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I bought this game for cheap when it was on offer as I'd heard it had a lot of bad reviews and I wasn't prepared to spend a fortune on it but hey, £3 for a game that's single player, versus and 4 player co-op seemed like a good deal to me and it was. I enjoyed playing it with my mates co-op and within a few days of buying it we completed it but not because it was rubbish, because we played it with an open mind, made our own decisions about it and it was, for us, a good game. It has loads of aliens, of different types to blast into tiny pieces, some cool weapons and of course, the motion tracker from the films (which is very useful) and the graphics are pretty nice too.\nThe co-op mode is just the single player story mode but with the addition of 3 friends playing along with you and the game was good fun, in parts a little challenging and can even make you jump when the aliens catch you off guard and appear from out of thin air, hiding in walls right in front of your face!\nI can only pick fault with one aspect of it from what I've played and that is simply the teleport system. When playing co-op if you wandered too far ahead from your team mates the game teleports them to you. Well, in theory thats what it's supposed to do but we discovered it would teleport you at random times! Sometimes if you were only a few feet from your team mates and there was no reason to, quite often it would do this whilst in a fire fight which was most annoying, yet at other points you could get almost half a level in front and it wouldn't teleport anyone anywhere.\nThat was and so far is my only my pet hate about this game and once I've played it through some more I will update this review. This is a good game to play with friends from what I have played aside from the teleport system and I would recommend it to others.","February 16, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I bought this game for cheap when it was on offer as I'd heard it had a lot of bad reviews and I wasn't prepared to spend a fortune on it but hey, £3 for a game that's single player, versus and 4 player co-op seemed like a good deal to me and it was. I enjoyed playing it with my mates co-op and within a few days of buying it we completed it but not because it was rubbish, because we played it with an open mind, made our own decisions about it and it was, for us, a good game. It has loads of aliens, of different types to blast into tiny pieces, some cool weapons and of course, the motion tracker from the films (which is very useful) and the graphics are pretty nice too.\nThe co-op mode is just the single player story mode but with the addition of 3 friends playing along with you and the game was good fun, in parts a little challenging and can even make you jump when the aliens catch you off guard and appear from out of thin air, hiding in walls right in front of your face!\nI can only pick fault with one aspect of it from what I've played and that is simply the teleport system. When playing co-op if you wandered too far ahead from your team mates the game teleports them to you. Well, in theory thats what it's supposed to do but we discovered it would teleport you at random times! Sometimes if you were only a few feet from your team mates and there was no reason to, quite often it would do this whilst in a fire fight which was most annoying, yet at other points you could get almost half a level in front and it wouldn't teleport anyone anywhere.\nThat was and so far is my only my pet hate about this game and once I've played it through some more I will update this review. This is a good game to play with friends from what I have played aside from the teleport system and I would recommend it to others.","February 16, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Based on the Alien franchise. If you enjoy the films then you will enjoy this game.\n\nAliens: Colonial Marines takes place after the second film, Aliens. You return to planet LV-426 after the thermo nuclear explosion and your job is to investigate what happened.\nThe story is a roller coaster of a ride from start to finish. The game keeps true to its original ideas from the films. There are many places and object you will come across from film, Aliens.\n\nThe graphics are excellent however there is a frame rate issue. Looking at other reviews I personally believe the issue is over exaggerated. However if you are a hardcore first person shooter then I can understand why this would be an issue.\nFor me the only times it became an issue is when you move your angle of direction too quickly i.e. spin around. When moving from a position the game looked smooth most of the time. There were odd occasions when it will freeze for half a second to load up more of the game. Overall it is playable and does not effect the game play in a big way.\n\nThe sound is great and constantly keeps you on edge. All of the music and sound effects are taken from the film like the guns and the alien motion scanner. Also as an added bonus there is cameo voice acting from Michael Biehn who played Cpl. Dwayne Hicks .\n\nApart from the frame rate issue the game play is good fun, specially if you are an Alien film fan. It is a basic old school shooter with no cover mechanics apart from crouching. There are plenty of guns to choose from and upgrade. You can replay campaigns to gain more experience points for your profile character which makes a good replay mechanic.\nThe multiplayer section of the game looks good however it is dead at the time of this review.\n\nI recommend this game for Alien fans and old school shooter fans. However I would not recommend it for hardcore first person shooter fans. Only because of the frame rate issue.","July 15, 2014","true","50.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The content, weapons, storyline, the references to the movies, Alien fans will notice every single one of them and probably enjoy this game as much as I did and still do. Of course, not everything is shiny and perfect: As mentioned in the reviews, the AI is.. let's say weird at times with Aliens being stuck or human enemies running right into your gunfire. Many bugs have been fixed with the recent patches, but at times, you can still see the ugly textures (actually, the games loads HiRes textures, but that can sometimes take several seconds..).\nIf you like the franchise, and can ignore the remaining problems, you're definitely in for a treat.\n\nOh right, if you want to get addons, do yourself and your wallet a favor and get "Bughunt" and "Stasis Interrupted" only. The mappacks, weapons and skins can be fancy, but the game is perfectly fine without them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/judassem/recommended/49540/","judassem","Judassem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/judassem/","1125 products in account","Honestly, I think people who say this game is "the worst game of 2013," "the biggest disappointment of the last decade," or some other bulls**t are just pretentious hipsters, who haven't even tried playing the game seriously. I've played every single game in Aliens franchise, and I have finished every campaign on every game. However, I'm not an Alien fanboy, I just love the theme as it makes for a great scary atmosphere. Believe me when I say this, this game is by far the best game in the Aliens series since the all-time classic Aliens versus Predator. It's much better than the previous Aliens vs. Predator, in which every campaign took only 5 hours at max, and none of the campaigns had any meaningful story at all. This game has intense and awesome action sequences, a superb atmosphere that fills you with dreadful anticipation, and accompanies them with a really successful (not on Bioshock Infinite-level, of course) story and pleasing graphics.\nNow, you may ask why people are giving this game such a hard time. They used to be right. When the game came out. It hads LOTS of horrible bugs, so far as to make the game unplayable. The AI was so terrible it made you rage-quit. The aliens were unable to see you when you were bunny-hopping in front of them. Quests were broken because your idiot companions couldn't be arsed to open a godd*mn door for you. ALL OF THIS ARE IN THE PAST NOW, GUYS! THEY FIXED THE FRIGGIN GAME! Stop hating and try playing it again.\nThere are still some minor bugs, they are far, really far from making this game deserve such bad scores. Hell, think of Skyrim, Diablo III, every game in Battlefield series, and countless other modern games which were full of stupid bugs when they first came out. This game got 10 times the amount of hate those bug-ridden games got. It is so unfair. Just look at Rome Total War II and Battlefield 4. They were totally unplayable for many weeks after they were put on the market. Yet you don't see anyone calling them a "complete failure" or "the worst game in recent years." Such bigotry, much hate, so unfair, wow.\nAs for the aliens walking on two legs. People who think they make this game terrible must be very open-minded. They created a new type of alien for this game. Those two-legged aliens are not your normal aliens, they are a special type which cannot see, but only hear, and their attack is exploding themselves, showering you with deadly acid. Battlefield 4 gives you GUIDED RPGs, and it gets "Editor's Game of the year" award. These guys create a new type of alien which walks on two legs and suddenly they are "dumbf*ks who know nothing about the Alien universe."\nFinal verdict? 8/10. This is not a revolutionary game, but I wouldn't have regretted buying this game even if I paid something like 20 bucks. For 2 dollars (on Amazon during Christmas holiday) this game probably has the greatest price/performance ratio in the video gaming industry. Go play it, and don't give a sh*t about what those pretentious haters say.","January 6, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Much like Duke Nukem Forever, its impossible for hardcore gamers to not instantly recognize the name.  Much like DNF, Colonial Marines has been in development for a very long time, since 2001 to be exact. Time would witness the game's stunted, postponed, and delayed development over the course of many years. Fans of both Aliens and Shooters would hold out an incredible amount of hope and patience for the release of a game that was sure to please everyone considering its long development cycle.\n\nThat was a mistake we are all guilty for.\n\nAfter many screenshots, trailers, magazine articles, and interviews the game finally landed into our hands, was it worth the wait? Was it anything we expected it to be? Not exactly. From the beginning it was already evident that Colonial Marines suffered through a painful development process, with plenty of outsourcing, rewriting, and clashes between multiple developers working on it. The final result is a game that misses nearly every mark it should have struck perfectly, and leaves fans of the franchise and avid gamers with a feeling of utter disappointment. Every single thing about the game failed to please. This game is no doubt bound for the $2 bargain bin steam sale, and even then, is not worth the price of admission.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n> Multiplayer is suprisingly decent (despite nobody playing it)\n> Enviroments are somewhat interesting\n\nTHE BAD\n- Horrific writing\n- Terrible Voice Acting\n- Lifeless and unlikable characters\n- Atrocious AI that charges you blindly\n- Shockingly bad ending\n- Dated Graphics\n- IS SUPPOSED TO BE OFFICIAL CANON\n- Boring Cutscenes/Setpieces\n- Aliens arent scary or threatening in the slightest\n- Everything Else\n\nTHE UGLY\nThis is what we were promised. The game dosent look/sound/play anything like this. AT ALL.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xulEWbAyv3k\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nEven if you are a hardcore fan of both the franchise and shooters, this game will disappoint in every way. You might be thinking to yourself "Its gotta be good for a few laughs, right?" No. You'd be better off spending that money on a pack of gum. But if you decide to go ahead and get it anyway, be prepared to recite the famous lines of the film its based on:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsx2vdn7gpY\n\n1/10 Abysmal.","June 18, 2014","false","14.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

As for the plot it actually has promise, given that this game was worked on by writers from Battlestar Galactica and is considered canonical in the Alien series would give one hope, sadly however as you play the game the way the story unfolds and the events that take place are subpar at best, without spoiling anything here I will say that by the end you will be shaking your head asking what exactly went wrong, from the disjointed emotions conveyed with below average voice acting even from the bigger names in the Alien franchise history that come back, to the sloppy and plot hole filled writing that in many ways make it seem more like Alien fan fiction then anything else.\n\nBut enough about the story lets talk about the gameplay! ...It blows, the shooting feels clunky, none of the guns seem at all accurate and while I know that might be due to the guns in Aliens lore being kind of bad in the first place, when I attach a red dot sight to a gun and aim down it, I expect my bullet to go where the dot is, not below it, or to have the sight swimming back and forward enough that you actually are more accurate when you fire from the hip, and in the end none of that really matters because the enemy AI feels like it took the short bus to work, the Xenomorphs act more like giant bugs and rush you, though you can counter this by backpedaling as they are not really faster then you are, and will not try tactics like attacking from your sides except for the rare times when they throw hunters at you and even then they are easily bested.\n\nYou will see Aliens running into the walls, failing about, blowing up, and otherwise acting more comedical then scary or threatening, but that is only part of the game, because luckily you get to fight human mercenaries as well, in an Aliens game... lets let that soak in for a moment.\n\nOverall this game just... bad, the multiplayer is not counted in all this due to no one in their right mind playing it, the game is littered with bad DLC, and the core gameplay and plot fails as both a regular game and a piece of fan service and I recommend staying as far away from this one as you can.\n\nGame Over, Man.","June 17, 2014","false","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sure, this game did have a lot of expectation to live up to, but in the end, it does pay tribute to the Alien franchise. You get to explore LV-426 and the U.S.S. Sulaco, you get to wield the U.S.C.M. arsenal, and not to mention, you get to mow down a bunch of aliens. Not to mention the multiplayer (If there are any people on the servers though) is FREAKING INSANE AND AWESOME. The DLC for this game great; there's a movie map pack containing multiplayer maps from the Alien movies themselves, such as the Nostromo or Fury 161. Then there's Bug Hunt, an awesome gamemode similar to that of Nazi Zombies from CoD. There's also a seperate campaign you can download that really pays tribute to Aliens.  Sure, the alien A.I. may not be as good as it should be, but it's improved a lot since the initial release of the game. My only complaint though is the levels you have to fight the Weyland-Yutani mercs. It's annoying, but it isn't bad enough to ruin the overall game experience. Overall, I give this game a 7/10.\n\n","January 16, 2014","true","45.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you like first person shooters and you like the movie Alien 2 you will like this game.  It is fun the graphics good and you feel like you are a Marine from the movie.  I didnt notice any bugs, the only thing I can say bad is that the human AI were kind of dumb and easy to kill but I was playing on the easiest mode and the only other thing is that my team mates would get in front of me when shooting at stuff, it freaked me out at first but then didnt bother me when I realized I could not hurt them and I could still see and hit my targets.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/49540/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Download size: 10 gb\nPlaytime: 8 hours for campaign\n\nI bought a physical copy of Aliens Colonial Marines (ACM) about a year ago when it was free after rebate despite the poor ratings that just about every reviewer gave the game. The game was at least a few months old already, so it’s possible that a lot of the things people were complaining about had already been patched out. Definitely the game has its problems, but it does not deserve its 45 Metacritic score. A couple of weird things I noticed right off were that after taking about 30 minutes to install from the DVD, Steam still needed to download an additional 6 gb to finish installation. There must have been a bunch of replaced core files, because I don’t own any DLCs for this game. Also, lately I’ve been experiencing a bug where immediately after exiting the game, the game immediately launches again. I know I’m not the only one with this problem because I did a quick search online for a fix. Apparently one solution is to make the game run in administrator mode (so it asks you for a password on startup) which would allow you to cancel the game launch. EDIT: It didn’t work, making the game run in admin mode keeps it from starting at all. I just stick with quickly cancelling the game launch.\n\nAliens: CM takes place a few months after the second Alien movie (probably the best movie). If you recall the ending of Aliens, Hicks (the marine), Ripley (the survivor), and Newt (little girl) escaped planet LV-426 in the marine ship Sulaco. Well in the game, their space ship was somehow called back to the planet after they ejected their life pods onto another planet (beginning of Alien 3). You play a marine named Winters who is part of a large expedition sent to investigate the Sulaco’s reappearance at LV-426 and the vanishing of the Hadley’s Hope colony on the planet. The story follows your attempts at surviving both the alien onslaught and a large force of Weyland Yutani private military forces who are up to no good.\n\nACM is a fairly standard first person shooter but has a weapon inventory system where you only carry 3 weapons at once (primary, secondary, pistol) that you can switch between. However at any time during the game you can press your weapon inventory button and swap between any weapons that you own. This means that you are essentially carrying every weapon at once (like the old Doom games) but you need to go into your inventory to swap which weapon is in which weapon slot (like Dead Island or Borderlands except you never ‘drop’ weapons, every weapon is unique). This is clearly a way to make weapon switching easier for console gamers. Speaking of weapons, there are quite a few that you can choose from (and customize). In addition to the various guns you acquire through story progression, you can also find “legendary” guns, which are weapons belonging to characters from the movie Aliens. For example “Hudson’s Pulse Rifle” or “Hicks’ Shotgun” are powerful versions of the normal weapons but cannot be customized (like the special weapons in Far Cry 3). The weapon customization system is pretty well done, so you’ll probably end up using your customized guns rather than the legendary versions. Again, you don’t have gun inventory limitations, so you can carry both versions if you want.\n\nLike a lot of modern “squad based” shooters, you will spend a great deal of time with at least one other computer controlled “team mate.” The team mate gives a little fire support, but you’ll have to do most of the killing. If anything, the computer controlled team mates can be an annoyance when you’re trying to complete game challenges (small game achievements that give bonus exp) because they keep shooting enemies that you’re setting up for specific kills. For example there’s a challenge for killing 10 enemies with melee, and the team mate will steal the kill as you move in to finish off the enemy. By the way, melee in this game is very weak, and it takes a bunch of hits to kill anything. It’s mostly to shove aliens away when they’re grappling you.\n\nPros:\n+Decent story line (which is considered canon to the Aliens franchise). This isn’t some game maker’s fan fiction.\n+Some levels are creepily atmospheric, especially the ones where you’re alone in the dark.\n+The game has multiplayer coop for the main campaign! Unfortunately I don’t have any friends who own the game, so I haven’t been able to try it.\n\nCons:\n-The game has its share of bugs, the most annoying of which is the re-launch bug I mentioned earlier. Earlier versions of the game had poor enemy AI, but it must have been patched since I didn’t really notice it. Early reviewers of the game said that the xenos often would not even attack the player which I kind of understand because in the movies the xenos prioritize threats (like actual predators). So I guess you could say the game maker wanted the enemies to behave realistically, unfortunately an action shooter game isn’t very fun if the enemies wait for you to attack first. There’s also this weird thing where human enemies will try to shoot at you THROUGH the cover they’re hiding behind. This means you’ll hear gunfire and see sparks showing exactly where the enemy is hiding.\n-Even on Recruit mode (easy mode) the game can be difficult (you have very low health). I think they expect everyone to be playing in coop or something because when I went online for tips, people are saying how easy it is if you can get a partner to play with.\n-The game has a rank progression system where you get exp for finishing levels and playing multiplayer, but progression is very slow for someone like me who can really only play single player. There isn’t much activity going on in multiplayer. The marine progression and xeno progression are separate, and xeno can only be leveled up in multiplayer. The later ranks don’t actually make you stronger (higher life/damage) they mostly unlock customizations and cosmetics.\n\nApparently a while ago there was a class action lawsuit against the makers of Aliens Colonial Marines because of unmet expectations. This is hilarious to me since I’ve never heard of game makes being sued for making a bad game. Part of the controversy was that the company Gearbox was paid by Sega to develop the game, but spent a lot of the money on their own game Borderlands 2 (which I loved).\nFrom what I hear, the early trailers and gameplay footage showed to potential customers was actually far superior to the actual game. I’m not sure how that happened, but I do agree that the graphics aren’t especially good for a modern game. I turned off the “film grain” option and it’s obvious that not too much effort was spent on the game’s textures.\n\nIf you can manage your expectations Aliens Colonial Marines is a decent cheap game experience. Sega seems to have abandoned the idea of trying to make a lot of money on it, so you can probably get it for $5 during a sale. If nothing else, you can set the game to recruit mode and just run past most of the xenos to experience the story. They kind of jump around a lot, and may even stop chasing you if you run far enough. Don’t try this with the Weyland Yutani mercs though, they’ll blow you away.\n","December 16, 2014","true","19.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Below bulletpoints are my findings which are based on the completed campaign (with almost all the achievements attained there save for the ones of the campaign DLC) and I must also mention no multiplayer session was found when trying to look for parties online for a possible coop campaign or team deathmatch.\n\n+++ The game looks and feels good. Yeah I know there are videos comparing the gameplay trailer and the actual gameplay footage and there was the lawsuit filed against the publisher or developer. In fact, they also blamed each other for this and Kotaku has an article of all this mess but it's just best to forget about it. Development took quite many years - this is one of those games that went through a development hell and as a result of this critics ripped the game apart.\n\n+++ I do believe the atmosphere is right there where it should be. The sound effects are all great and there are many areas borrowed directly from Aliens. You can traverse through Hadley's Hope, for instance, and if you are an Aliens fan you'll recognise some of the rooms, vehicles and even Bishop turns up as a vital member of your team.\n\n- - - Aaaaaaaaaaand pretty much that's it. Everything else is bad. The game gives you an awful lot of chance to fight the soldiers of Weyland-Yutani. I did not like where they went with the story. Fighting the xenomorphs is good but sometimes it seems awkward (i.e. glitchy) - especially the 2 boss fights with bigger aliens. And then you have the encounter with the queen which is a complete letdown. And all this in the name of a story that is meant to be canon... to bridge Aliens with Alien 3.\n\n- - - Again, we have a 6-7 hour long campaign which is not much. If they highlighted the greatness of story during advertising why couldn't they give us a longer adventure? You team up with some marines and go together which obviously is an indication of a coop campaign. It is not necessarily bad but the AI controlling our fellow soldiers is not that good. Sometimes they are a pain and they can spawn at certain points quickly once you have advanced the story. An upside is that they cannot be downed so you do not spend any time with reviving them. In any case, playing in coop mode is probably much better than alone.\n\nColonial Marines was a letdown. The game has an excellent design and brings back a lot of memorable places / events from Aliens (not to mention the dog tags you are looking for or the so-called legendary weapons you can find e.g. Hicks' shotgun) but playing a tribute is not enough to create a decent game.\n\nIt is a good homage but a mediocre game that should have been properly finished.","April 8, 2014","false","8.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

I have gone through the hassle, yes, hassle, not challenge, of unlocking the "State of the Badass Art" Achievement on this game for defeating it on the hardest difficulty level. I've even managed to play some multiplayer before it became an abandoned wasteland. I was one of the fools who preordered it and I continued playing it after the update to the graphics that finally came.\n\nThat taken care of it's time for the actual review.\n\nDon't waste your money on this steaming pile of horse manure. Even if it's on sale.\n\nWhat we were promised as a community was bloody brilliant. It was graphical, intense, and it looked beautiful. Constant motion, brilliant graphical design, and made by companies that were well-known for good games. What we got I would've excused if it wasn't so falsely advertised and if it was made by an indie developer. Not after all the beautiful "In-game" footage and the screenshots and hype-building.\n\nWhen I first got the game I was carried by the hype and I even defended the game based off of my belief that most people disliked it purely because the motion-tracker was something you had to pick up and not something sitting in the HUD like in AVP2010.\n\nI own up to that and apologize to everyone for that. Which is more than I can say for the people responsible for the lie that is A:CM. If I could I'd refund this game and use the money on a different one but I can't.\n\nThe AI is buggy and slow and unresponsive and that's just the Marines.\n\nAliens sit out in the open practically begging to be shot.\n\nThere's enough ammo and such laying about that it makes challenge a thing of the past and the fact that your sidearm has infinite ammo redundant. Not to mention you can ALWAYS switch weapons with anything you've unlocked so if you do manage to spray-and-pray your way through your Pulse Rifle then you can just open a menu and trade it for the SMG.\n\nDifficulty level is a joke. The AI doesn't get harder you just get a bit weaker and in the case of the "Ultimate Badass" difficulty it just means you don't have a HUD. Boss fights are hysterical and only ever difficult because of spam not actual challenge.\n\nThe graphics level, compared to what we were promised, is something I'd expect from an Indie Dev, but they don't falsely advertise. The graphics are buggy and low-detail. It's almost funny in a sad way how easy it is to tell the difference between an alien and alien hive wall goop, where they should be blending perfectly. And this is all the static graphics not the motion graphics. Explosions are crap and nothing I can believe in. The characters at least don't clip into their parts like they did before the update. The ragdoll physics are.... sickening.\n\nOh, lest I forget, you spend more time in Call of Duty style shootouts with Wey-Yu personnel than you do actually having a horror experience fighting or running from Aliens.

I have gone through the hassle, yes, hassle, not challenge, of unlocking the "State of the Badass Art" Achievement on this game for defeating it on the hardest difficulty level. I've even managed to play some multiplayer before it became an abandoned wasteland. I was one of the fools who preordered it and I continued playing it after the update to the graphics that finally came.\n\nThat taken care of it's time for the actual review.\n\nDon't waste your money on this steaming pile of horse manure. Even if it's on sale.\n\nWhat we were promised as a community was bloody brilliant. It was graphical, intense, and it looked beautiful. Constant motion, brilliant graphical design, and made by companies that were well-known for good games. What we got I would've excused if it wasn't so falsely advertised and if it was made by an indie developer. Not after all the beautiful "In-game" footage and the screenshots and hype-building.\n\nWhen I first got the game I was carried by the hype and I even defended the game based off of my belief that most people disliked it purely because the motion-tracker was something you had to pick up and not something sitting in the HUD like in AVP2010.\n\nI own up to that and apologize to everyone for that. Which is more than I can say for the people responsible for the lie that is A:CM. If I could I'd refund this game and use the money on a different one but I can't.\n\nThe AI is buggy and slow and unresponsive and that's just the Marines.\n\nAliens sit out in the open practically begging to be shot.\n\nThere's enough ammo and such laying about that it makes challenge a thing of the past and the fact that your sidearm has infinite ammo redundant. Not to mention you can ALWAYS switch weapons with anything you've unlocked so if you do manage to spray-and-pray your way through your Pulse Rifle then you can just open a menu and trade it for the SMG.\n\nDifficulty level is a joke. The AI doesn't get harder you just get a bit weaker and in the case of the "Ultimate Badass" difficulty it just means you don't have a HUD. Boss fights are hysterical and only ever difficult because of spam not actual challenge.\n\nThe graphics level, compared to what we were promised, is something I'd expect from an Indie Dev, but they don't falsely advertise. The graphics are buggy and low-detail. It's almost funny in a sad way how easy it is to tell the difference between an alien and alien hive wall goop, where they should be blending perfectly. And this is all the static graphics not the motion graphics. Explosions are crap and nothing I can believe in. The characters at least don't clip into their parts like they did before the update. The ragdoll physics are.... sickening.\n\nOh, lest I forget, you spend more time in Call of Duty style shootouts with Wey-Yu personnel than you do actually having a horror experience fighting or running from Aliens. Well done Game Devs you made another run-and-gun Shooter.\n\nI'm going to stop now and finish. Don't waste your money. Buy a good game like Isolation seems to be.

My father, not sure why decided to take me to the movie theater without telling me absolutely nothing about the story. In Brazil, Aliens movie was rated PG13. Once the movie started and me and my sister were absolutely terrified with the fist chest burst in Ripley's nightmare, we were not prepared to later on, when all Colonial Marines were trapped with no ammo, except for Hick's shotgun, flamethrowers and two smartguns, I remember being totally scared and saw my father's amuzed grin when my sister, almost crying in fear, had asked my father to leave the movie theater.\n\nThis may sound absurd right now because, Aliens are not scary anymore. And one of the reasons to make such good movies like  Alien (1978)  and Aliens (1986) feel like a bad joke is because of games like ALIENS: Colonial Marines.\n\nI was really excited when I heard about a A:CM game which would have a very minimal HUD and have very realistic scenes, just like the movies or even more. Heard that they had contracted the same artist that designed some of the movie sets. It was like a dream. I would finally experiment what was to be in a Colonial Marine shoes, struggling for my own survival.\n\nLow ammo, nowhere to run. Totally outnumbered.\n\nMovie spoiler alert, do not read if you did not watch the movie.\n\n\n\n\nBut wait ... If I remember well, the atmosphere reactor, which is a HUGE nuclear powered structure, BLEW UP in the end of ALIENS, and the blast was so huge that the shockwave caught up the dropship they used to escape.\n\nSo ... the history is already broken. But since I wanted to live the same experience in the movie, it was not too bad(Still it made no sense why would there be any xenomorphs alive, the Queen was expelled in the airlock)\n\nThere are so many plot holes in this game. They even tried to come up with a explanation on how the Sulaco either never left LV-426 or came back from Fury 161(The planet of Alien3 movie).\n\nStory is bad, I can mention one guy you find cocooned in Sulaco, that really does have a sense of duty. He wishes to complete his mission to find and retrieve Sulaco's data computer (to find out what happened), he is not sure what is going on with him, but he does knows that something wrong is bound to happen. This guy is a hero, isn't he? He could have been, but instead, when you're hauling ♥♥♥ back to the ship, the chestburster inside him starts to rip his way out, and this wannabe hero does the most illogic thing. He pulls out a grenade inside the umbilical that serves as a connection between the two ships and blew it killing some other marines in the process.\n\nIT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE!!! Things start to go downhill very fast till the end, which is not a end, but may become a "proper" end in the DLC, which I'll be sure to never ever play.\n\nThis game is absolutely different from what Gearbox showed us in "work in progress" in E3 and every other advertisement about A:CM. Usually when regarding WIP, we expect things to get better instead of becoming worse like it seem to have happened.\n\nMaybe if I didn't expect anything from this game, I would consider it worth of 10usd or less. But since it is a major let down, and it seems that gearbox used the budget they had for A:CM to other purposes, I WOULD NOT SPEND EVEN A PENNY ON THIS.\n\nSeriously. I sworn to never ever buy anything from Gearbox again. They will not have my money, since they don't show a single gesture of respect towards gaming community.\n\nSome folks might say "wait, you're talking about the make of BORDERLANDS!!!", and yep that's them. And this is no place to talk about it, but Google for "Code Hunters" and you will find that Gearbox have no limits in wrong doing. They do whatever the f*ck they want to earn money, even if it is illegal.\n\nAlso, check out the current news for legal dispute that involves Sega and Gearbox regarding A:CM\n\nhttp://www.polygon.com/2014/9/3/6102035/sega-gearbox-lawsuit-aliens-colonial-marines\n\nThis is shameful. Sega won't take the blame alone, as they point that Gearbox is the one who totally disgraced what was supposed to be the best game experience of Alien Franchise. Let's hope Alien Isolation fills this gap.\n\nThanks for reading!","September 25, 2014","false","13.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/recommended/49540/","Soupinator","Soüp®: Legendary Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soupinator/","1293 products in account","You know something strange is going on when serious reviewers on mainstream media sites sound like they're channeling Yahtzee when reviewing a game.  It's a strange case of expectation vs reality.  When a game fails to meet expectations, it gets ripped to shreds for the tiniest flaws that people would find amusing in other games and ends up with a much worse rating than a game that was expected to be bad and is an entirely worse game.\n\nBy now everyone's heard the rumors about the turbulent development of this game.  It's obviously a tale of project management gone seriously wrong with the game being put on hold for years and later passed onto another studio.  The most amazing thing I've heard however is that just 9 months before release, Gearbox got the game back from Timegate, threw most of it out, and started over.  That's pretty amazing if you ask me and I doubt any other studio could pull it off.\n\nTo the game itself:  The campaign is a reasonable length, pretty standard these days.  Served with a heavy dose of fan service, some people may like it more than others.  The story's more of a stretch than Alien 3, wedging itself in there in the realm of cinematic impossibility.  Voice acting's a mixed bag but the writing is terrible and there's plenty of cringe-worthy lines.  The campaign is fully coopable as well, but the coop feels a bit tacked on with a couple of noname marines tagging along with the main character, and the game teleporting people to the leader when someone walks 5 feet ahead of the group.\n\nThat said, the gameplay is pretty good at least.  It's fun shooting xenos and even the Wayland-Yutani goons who come after you to cover up their horrifying experiments.  The xeno animations may be a bit wonky so they don't quite move or act like aliens should, but they'll still rip you to shreds if you aren't paying attention.  Your AI partners are pretty useless, mostly firing blanks and getting in the way (not that that's anything unusual) though some people have more trouble with this than others.\n\nMultiplayer on the other hand is a bit of a mess.  It's wildly unbalanced, with marines having a huge advantage at lower levels and being able to level up through single player and co-op.  The marines even get a fully automatic shotgun that can kill most xenos in one shot.  After the aliens level up and get certain upgrades, suddenly they can take 8 shots from the same gun without dying and dominate the marines.  The game uses peer-to-peer matchmaking so lag is always a problem and the third person control of the aliens is beyond awful.  Wallclimbing barely works and is pretty much useless except for climbing up onto high points to spit at the marines with the spitter.  Some of the modes are somewhat fun at least.\n\nI think the best way to sum up this game is to say it's disappointing.  After watching the E3 demo from a couple years ago and then playing the first level in the real game yourself, it's hard not to be mad about what the game could have been.  The graphics went from top of the line to couple-years-ago-average to work on consoles and took all the atmosphere along with it.  It makes me wonder if things might've been different if the game had come out next year targeted for the next generation of consoles.\n\nBottom line: Disappointing but still better than Call of Duty.","March 6, 2013","false","26.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","8"

Weapons free - time for a bug hunt!\nYou've got all the tools of the trade: pulse rifle, shotguns, pistols, flamethrowers, and yes, the famed smart gun.\nEveryone's heard the negatives - it was too expensive and buggy as hell... well I played through the campaign with a full four-marine squad of friends and family and had a blast. Apparently its been patched up enough to be playable. Sure, I'd have loved for it to have decent graphics and writing but that doesn't make this a bad game.\nRe: gameplay, the aliens sometimes sneak up on you by moving silently and other times attack head on. I'd have preferred better use of acid to up the danger levels of interacting with the beasts. The human enemies were rather boring placeholders for "non-alien enemy x" but whatever.\nPerusing the DLC I decided to skip everything except for the "Stasis Interrupted" campaign pack, which also allows for co-op with a prequel to the main story involving an assortment of survivors and good old Cpl Hicks.\nTL;DR Being familiar with the films probably would aid your appreciation of the game.

Impressed me at times by hiding or running away. Other times they froze up and stood still.\n-There's no balance in difficulty. On normal, some of the human enemies can kill you in 2-3 hits in half a second.\n-Gearbox dropped support for this game immediately (SHAME ON YOU). This includes multiplayer support and SHIFT codes.\n\n(As of October 4, 2014 - the latest patch has yet to fix any of problems.)\n\nIf you think this won't bother you, then I recommend it. There is decent core gameplay and they also managed to tap into some of the nostalgia from the movie. Otherwise try the 2010 remake of Alien vs Predator or Alien: Isolation and forget this game ever existed.\n\nI personally would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy a few segments. They did put a smile on my face. Unfortunately the game had unparallel hype and failed to live up to any of it. I went in expecting nothing and came out neutral.

A mod could easily fix most of the problems and alter the score to an 8/10 but that's hoping for too much.

Textures resemble something you would expect from the Doom 3 era, except, somehow worse, featuring both a dull and jagged visual experience. The sounds, although familar to those who enjoyed the film series, lack a certain punch, this coupled with an uninspired, dredfully acted voice acting ensemble. The story arc is also sure in infuriate those true movie fans who respect the authenticity of the Alien Universe. In fact, voice actor Micheal Bein sounds as if he is forced at gunpoint to deliver this hot mess.\nOn a postive note, fun can be had in small doses during online co-op mode, where two can experience the almost comic like deliver of awful, nearly on rails gameplay and insane visual bugs.\nThe first chapter of the DLC "Stasis Interupted", is actually a good plot. It intelligently features an everday civilian (non-hero),  making the experience almost feel believable and emotional. It is a small gem in a bucket of sand but to those who absolutely has to finish every "Alien" game, you can look forward to that bit before it panders back to the land of mediocrady.\n\n5/10","July 27, 2014","false","18.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Join up with the best of the best MLG Call of Dooky players, starring: That generic Space Marine guy you play as. Ples wallis O'no! That girl with the baby in her. The red head girl you called dibs to breed with if things go south! Captain Sargeant peg leg! Yet another android. And the featured guest, The Queen! played by: ur m0m!"\n\n"Go on a $WAGGY adventure following the dorito brick road to find Ripley's dank noscope $niper r1fle that you can only use for 10 minutes! Laugh for hours at aliens getting stuck in their own nest because the A.I pathing is 2 sk1ll3d 4 u! Discover the poorly written plot! The Russians have genetically created aliens to attack space New York City and only you, and your unmemorable crew can save the day! Use Ripley's Dank memes to p0wn Russian CoD scrubs and enforce Freedom for OVER NINE THOUSAAAAAAAND!!! years."\n\nI bought this for 3.74, and even though I heard about what this game did I wanted to give it an honest chance...The innocent 10 year old boy within me has passed away. No, MURDERED by poor writing, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ A.I, and empty multiplayer servers. Followed by non-stop Weyland Mercs spamming grenades instantly killing him because ♥♥♥♥ 3 second count downs.\n\nThe Campaign  To sum it all up, the story is set 17 weeks after Alien 2. You play as a marine sent to investigate a squad's disappearance. This leads to a battle for survival in a three way war that is dragged out for far too long within the campaign. 70% of the game is shooting hired guns, the minority of the game is spent fighting aliens...Who can't even crawl out of their own scripted spawn correctly. And this game's greatest sin, bringing a character back from the dead that was "explained" to be terminated in Alien: 3 all in the name of ♥♥♥♥ing fan service.\n\nCharacters are dull as a rock, and just as more within the game as the "companions" get in your way. You also can't rely on them since their weapons might as well be sticks with canned beans loaded into them.\n\nCo-op is also there so any chance of scares goes out the window. But I'm not going to complain too much about co-op because it actually helps the game as far as 'fun' goes (and it helps your sanity.) The ONLY problem with co-op is, the maps are just too small for it. It's very tight making combat difficult and reviving fallen teammates common on higher difficulties.\n\nMultiplayer  The multiplayer is defintiely fun! Well, at least when you've maxed everything. Going in fresh is a disaster waiting to happen. It's your typical TDM game modes with an objective thrown in, so it's nothing much. The negative side of multiplayer is the lacking population. But the good news about multiplayer is it's not completely dead in the water. The servers are still functional It simply lacks a population. But I really don't blame anyone for not wanting to touch this game ever again, pre-order consumers especially. Despite that, it's fun to mess around with here and there.\n\nOn the other hand, I think it could have been fleshed out a bit more instead of a generic TDM. For example: Weyland players must capture Xeno players (but aren't allowed to kill them) While Marine players are tasked with killing off Xeno players before any of them can be captured. Meanwhile the Xeno players are tasked to seed as many players as possible.\n\nFinal Verdict  The only positive things in this tasteless game, is customization, and co-op. The constant fan service, the half ♥♥♥♥♥ A.I, the boring sterotypical CoD "companions" (Guy you just met becomes your bro friend and female character is there just to be a female, "she has ♥♥♥♥! that's the only character development she needs!")\n\nI send this message to any badass Marine out there, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE! Call Of Alien: Randy Pitchfork kicked me in the balls while a FOX stole my wallet is a 4/10! AVP:2010 has more content and better story telling than this dogshit. And if you want a horror shooter, go buy F.E.A.R.

I just want to repeat that, because I want you to take this journey with me: 6 hours. A friend and I played through the entire campaign. The cost of admission to get the game? 80% off. If this game had been released in 2003 for the normally asked price, it might be a good value. Did I enjoy it? Immensely, but not for the reasons that one normally enjoys a game.\n\nSo, it's a good game, then? It depends on your definition of good. If you like things to be so horribly broken out of the box that it's hilarious, then yes, this game is fan-freakin'-tastic. If you set out to play a game where all of the characters have the same facial expression all the time like Vin Diesel in a Fast and Furious movie, a ridiculous soundtrack that does not fit the Alien franchise whatsoever (It would fit in a Star Wars game, though!), sound effects that make no sense whatsoever, and better yet, voice acting that also makes no sense whatsoever...then this game gets an A+ rating. All of these things are available in huge buckets. It's a veritable cavalcade of frivolity and laziness. I wonder how many hours the unpaid design and programming interns at Gearbox put in to making this awesome, unintentionally hilarious game. I say unpaid, because I imagine this was also used as their capstone project to graduate with their associate's degree.\n\nHow about some specifics? Sure! The animations of the Xenomorphs look absolutely ridiculous. Cute, almost. The sounds for the Xenomorphs are, quite literally, stock sounds of cats manipulated a very small amount. None of it is terrifying, and ruins the terrifying concept of the franchise. The game is claustrophobic, in a bad way - half of the game is running backward to do something. Invisible walls are there, and then they disappear (which is a situationally ironic statement to make) after doing some entirely arbitrary action.\n\nBad AI? There is no AI, everything moves on a track. It is patterned. Either that, or the AI is so poorly programmed that it seems this way. I spent 15 minutes laughing at the queen not being able to reach me in a corner, but breathing heavily and whipping her tail, a lot like my dog does before knocking something off of the coffee table in my living room!\n\nUnintentionally hilarious, that's the best I can come up with. Did I enjoy it? Yes. It was so ridiculously bad that I couldn't help but enjoy it. Whether this was Gearbox's or Sega's fault is beyond the point, all they would have to do is change all of the marketing to call it a parody and they would do grand. It's definitely a parody of the Aliens franchise!\n\nI've seen a lot of reviews that say they would only recommend it for hardcore fans of the franchise. Nuh-uh. No, because I'm a hardcore fan of the franchise, and have been from a very young age, and I exclaim that this is the worst thing to happen to Aliens since the AVP movie came out in 2004 - and I loved that movie for the same reasons I love this game.\n\n6 hours. Including half hour breaks while still in game, including bathroom breaks while still in game, including meals, cigarettes, and taking my dog outside.... while still in game. You're looking at a good, solid 4 hours of game here wrapped up in a budget title with AAA packaging. If you're all about some achievements - go for it, you get one for starting the game, and then you get one for starting a campaign! Then you get one for firing your first bullet, for getting facehugged, and for laughing out loud at how ridiculous it is.\n\nBut it's not all hilariously bad. No. What the game gets right, it gets really right. I actually liked the feel of the weapons and the actions of them. As long as I ignored the completely arbitrary upgrades that make absolutely no difference, I thought they were great! I also thought that the inconsistent use of punctuation, capitalization, and plot helped add to the experience and, overall, made my 80% off purchase well worth it.\n\nI wish I knew whether or not H.R. Giger would feel avenged or offended, since he was horribly ripped off after the first Alien movie, continually. Avenged because of the fact that this game makes everyone involved in its production ridiculous, other than him, or offended, that they would take his concepts and do everything they can to make them seem as ridiculous as possible.\n\n6 hours.\n\n5/10 overall. Not recommended unless you REALLY like unintentional parodies and hilarity. If you've been playing too many great games lately, pick it up! if you've been playing a lot of bad games lately, I would suggest skipping it. If you're a fan of the franchise, I would suggest that you refuse to connect this with it in any way.\n\nReplay value: ...Actually kind of high. I want to see if at any point ANYTHING makes any sense. Actually, no, I take that back, I want my 10 gigabytes of hard drive space back.\n\nAlso, Vin Diesel rules. I don't want it to seem like that comparison was made in an attempt to insult Vin Diesel, but his facial expression never friggin' changes. Also, i'm going to go ahead and say I recommend this game. I know I said I didn't...but, still, I kinda do.","December 3, 2014","true","6.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","9","17","4","1"

I can't speak to how it played on day one, but I found it worked fine on my system. The graphics could have been more polished. The pulse riffle sound was on point. The Aliens do make "rifle fodder" and are pretty much running at you like heat seaking missles, but when I watch "Aliens" the movie it's not too different. The motion tracker was a nice add on, really useful in multiplayer. As for the story... It was a better than Alien3, Resurrection, and Prometheus. Last time I checked there hasn't been a good "Alien" story in the last 30 years so I wasn't expecting much here. Having played all the DLC now, I can say Bughunt is must. Bughunt is the best mode in the game, and a blast to play in co-op. Stasis Interupted is the section of the story they cut out to sell you as DLC, it helps tie everything together. The games campaign is not 1 star nor is it 5. It's a decent 3. Bughunt & multiplayer are the best modes, I rate them a 4 out 5. Match making is broken, so you'll need to friend up, or find a group that plays. If your a fan of Aliens, catch this one on a Steam sale.

It does not play very fast paced, but it's faster than Doom 3 for example. It's nothing like Quake 3, it's simply a generic moderate paced FPS.\nThis game just seems to be a mess, it has an incosistency about it in regards to map design and quality.\nThis game has rather annoying NPCs with bad A.I., ugly graphics with occasional performance issues, bad music and lackluster sound effects. It has an overall lack of quality compared to other first person shooters currently available and at the time of the games release.\nThe game had a pretty wild past in development but the end result is a game that is simply not worth your time or money.\n\nPros:\n-A good length Campaign which can be played both Online and Offline.\n-Some familiar characters, weapons, monsters, and enviroments from the movies. If your a fan you might enjoy it more.\n-Some Nice graphics and sound effects. Some nice DLC that includes maps and weapons to extend your playing experience.\n\nCons:\n-NPC A.I. is noticebly stupid and useless, and they can actually prevent game progress.\n-Graphics seems blurry and ugly, map design is boring and generic, weapon inpacts are lacking.\n-No Cards, very high price tag.\n\nThere are many more entertaining First Person Shooters available today, and if you really want a fun Alien series FPS, play Alien versus Predator Classic, or Alien versus Predator instead.\nSomething went wrong here.","October 25, 2015","false","46.1"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

In this review, I have to admit that I didn't follow the progress, I wasn't familiar with the E3 footage, and I didn't play through this game until November 4th - 6th, 2014; well after it was released and patched up.\n\nIt's not a bad game by any means. The graphics are good, though a lot of the textures (particularly monitor screens) seem really low resolution. I'm not a big fan of the "constant AI companion" model, but it suits the movie, and I thought it was interesting that games are finally achieving what "Daikatana" was supposed to do.\n\nI liked the environments and the general story (some of the dialogue sucks, though the actors are doing their best with it). The challenge level was about right for me.\n\nI remember a lot of people complained about the "blind aliens" level. I thought it was an okay part of the game. They're not just randomly blind and stupid- they're basically "damaged" by radiation. It's a gimmick that serves gameplay rather than story, but nothing too bad. A lot of the aliens did attack with the "walking approach for a hug" move, but again, it didn't ruin the experience too much for me.\n\nBig pros; I think fighting alongside Hicks is real childhood wish fulfillment for people who grew up with the movie. It was great to see his character come back and kick ♥♥♥, and I'm grateful to Michael Biehn for reprising the role (even though he said it was a miserable experience).\n\nWas it worth the prepurchase price I paid for the game? I am not sure. I think it's definitely worth $14.99 to any fan of the Aliens movies though. Maybe this game fell flat as a first person shooter to a lot of people, but I think it does a pretty good job of creating a cinematic experience for a player to enjoy for a few hours.","November 6, 2014","true","12.6"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","10"

I played it originally on console when it first came out so I've seen this game in it's worst form.\n\nThen when I eventually got it again on Steam I looked up some tweaking to improve A.I. and it made all the difference. On console the xenos would just run towards you with open arms, accepting their fate, but on pc they were on the walls, sneaking behind, lunging from all over.\n\nPros:\n- You get to play as a Colonial Marine. (M41-A Pulse Rifle...need I say more?)\n- You get to visit the Sulaco.\n- You get to visit LV-426 and view areas in the movie where our characters took their last stand. (Even the floor was damaged where Hudson was pulled under)\n- Legendary weapons for fanboys to get excited over.\n- Everything from the atmosphere, music, and sound effects are spot on.\n\nCons:\n- It was not the Alien game we were all hoping for.\n- A.I. by default isn't the best (nor the worst) but that can be fixed with mods/patches.\n- Ending felt rushed.\n\nBeing  a fan of the series I would say this game is worth a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/recommended/49540/","toquina","Overkill_Ashley♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/","302 products in account","Another example of the Alien franchise going in the wrong direction, as the once survival horror franchise takes another step closer to being a modern military shooter. There is little this game has to offer besides generic linear shooting, short campaign and gives off all the signs of a rushed incomplete product. While there are few moments that give off the Alien horror feel and tension, they are short lived and you  soon find yourself fighting against and alongside awful AI again.\n\nThe single player campaign simply emphasizes the numerous issues within the game. As well as soon questioning which product you bought. After the first level of killing aliens you will soon find yourself fighting mercenaries for at least fifty percent of the game or more. The game offers no originality or twists to combat while still finding it almost impossible to match up to even some of the most basic shooters on the market. There is a scene in which the game takes a stealthy horror approach however this very short experience is soon over before you find yourself back in the same combat situations you have been for the past two to three hours. Many aspects of the game offer the accuracy of detail for the Alien franchise such as accurate pulse rifle sounds and map design that respects the original designs from the Alien films. Other areas simply express the laziness of the development team as the iconic smartgun simply has the identical sound of the pulse rifle, which as many Alien fans will know do not sound the same.\n\nThe voice acting and storyline are both very poor, with voices just sounding unconvincing and out of place , while laughable dialog just makes cut scenes a painful chore to watch. Many times during the dialog the characters lips will become completely out of synchronization with the voice over. Characters will also often seem very stiff and lack animations, and at some points they will simply skip an animation which has just clearly just not being put into the game. One boss simple does not even have any attack animations, it simply walks around in circles and if it touches you, you find yourself on the floor for no reason missing a health bar.\n\nThe poor voice acting and animations make it difficult to take characters seriously or develop any bond to them, this is made even worse by the awful artificial intelligence of your team. You will often find your team shooting the walls, standing still or walking around in circles very confused during combat, it would have been much better if they simply removed the teammates from the game completely. If you were left alone instead of frequently listening to O’niels bad dialogue, it would greatly improve the experience. The enemy AI does little to inspire as well, as many aliens will simply slowly walk up you in the open and never use speed or wall running to help them, while bosses simply spend more time struggling to navigate the terrain.\n\nIf you are playing this, I would suggest co-op instead of single player, this by far improves the gameplay when you bring friends along. As more players join the game, the number of aliens and health of enemies increases to try to balance the game, however some areas especially against enemy infantry or not scaled. This often leaves situations such as four players walking through narrow corridors and killing two or three poorly armed scientists in each room and many players having nothing to do for around half an hour. There is no class system in co-op but simply an increased number of players, an area that the game could have looked at to improve the co-op teamwork involved.\n\nMultiplayer seems to have the most work put into it, with many customization upgrades for not only the marines but also for the aliens. It also offers more variety then the older Alien games with multiplayer, with new classes for the aliens to use in more effective ways such as a spitter or crusher aliens. It can be frustrating at times, as the aliens seem to have such little health issues with lag and controls means you may often die and be confused of what happened and why. Playing as the marines adds much more tension then the single player campaign has to offer. The motion sensor has use and often fuels the paranoia for the marine team trying to stay alive. These tense and exciting moments can soon be lost however, when you find aliens lagging then suddenly you are on the floor dead and the poor and sometimes none existent animations make this even more confusing. The multiplayer will unlikely have a long life, with many upgrades available within one or two days of playing multiplayer will soon lose interest to the majority of players with the lack of content.\n\nWith a season pass DLC already available on the steam store for 30$, for future DLC, I question how they feel its appropriate to charge for more content for this game while its clearly unfinished and lacking content in the main game. With many people disappointed with the DLC released for borderlands 2 made by Gearbox, I have little hope that we will be impressed and find our moneys worth within future DLC content. Personally I feel that the future DLC should be free, considering how much content that was promised before release simple is not there, but that isn’t how business works.\n\nPro:\n\nMost areas live up to the lore of Aliens\nFour player drop in/out co-op\nMultiplayer that can sometimes provide the paranoia fueling Alien experience\nSmall customization features and upgrades\nCons:\n\nPoor dialogue and voice acting\nPoor animations, sometimes none existent\nPoor visuals\nNo real boss fights\nDreadful enemy and team AI\nGeneric combat that struggles to meet up to even the most basic shooters\nLack of class system for co-op\nNo re-playability for the campaign\nMultiplayer can be fun, but has little to offer in the long term\n\nMy verdict is that you should avoid this game under all circumstances. There is little to be gained to playing this poorly executed shooter, while it may appeal to some of the Alien fans, and those into modern military shooters, it still is poor in every single aspect. Simply put, everything this game tries to do, other games do better as it just feels terribly outdated and unfinished. If you really want to purchase this product still, I would advise waiting a few months for a sale or the price to drop, I can’t imagine it will retain full price for very long.","February 12, 2013","false","15.2"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","2"

It has “legit” written all over it, but while there’s ample gore, acid blood, and the persistent modulating whine of marine pulse rifles, film’s nerve-wracking tension just isn’t there. For all the attention paid to the source material, it just doesn’t feel like Aliens.The best way to describe the gameplay is merely “standard.” The shooting is what you would come to expect from Call of Duty: aiming down the sights of a gun, shooting enemies and throwing grenades. It’s all there and never really feels different from any other shooter. Players will be pitted against both Xenomorphs and human mercenaries. The story falls short throughout the campaign. The voice acting consists of poorly written dialog and uninspired performances. The final payoff to the entire game is underwhelming, and questions are never really answered. It got to a point where I just tuned the story bits out.The lighting effects and visuals do look good in some areas. The animations, on the other hand, are very clunky. The enemy AI is just plain bad in many cases. Of course, that doesn’t stop them from being deadly. The multiplayer has different modes that put two teams against each other.Most players would think it would be more enjoyable to play the Aliens, but the Xenos are a clunky mess. Aliens: Colonial Marines is a mixed bag.It seems to have the right set up for a decent Aliens game with the presentation and look, but due to the boring story and clunky enemy AI, there is no tension or exciting action. The co-op is probably the best way to play, but players need to choose a higher difficulty if they want any kind of a challenge. The competitive multiplayer feels unbalanced.Aliens: Colonial Marines is so riddled with problems and boring stretches that it can be painful at times.I would only recommend this game to hardcore Alien fans.Overall 5/10.","September 30, 2014","true","28.2"," 21 of 41 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","21","41","0","0"

(minor spoiler alert)\nThere is a lots of fighting versus other humans (WY company) - it is interesting, at least lore-wise but perhaps it would be nicer to have more aliens instead, altough If I remember, fighting WY is in pretty much every other Alien (vs predator) game...\nAs stated earlier, there is weird retcon, which is really not necessary, though personally I liked it...\n\nOverall:\nThis game is NOT great, but it is good. It does not deserve the treatment it gets most of the time. It have decent graphics, decent story, decent enemies... so it is... well decent, to say the least... or most? If you are Alien fun, you should play it, if you're not you can avoid it and you won't miss anything.

First impressions when launching - there is hope for something smooth and cold about the screen that first launches before you press to play the game. The intro begins and the facial animation seems a generation behind. I work my way into the ship and computer consoles aren't even readable - Duke Nukem era! Graphically this may have been toned down to provide smooth play even on lower end machines. I hope for a graphics overhaul in an upcoming patch or that the GIGS of data somehow includes it. My little handheld motion detector has proven mostly useless so far .... [this was 20 minutes of play, SP campaign]\n\nContinued: Saw a few glitches with terrain during the next bit of single player. The audio seems ok enough, but having a hard time with the level of detail that's really needed to immerse yourself in the SP experience. The scripted AI for some of your fellows seems a bit weak and most of the time aliens ignore your AI side and come for you.

If you haven't heard already, Aliens: Colonial Marines maybe one of the biggest failures this year. While the graphics aren't so terrible, and the environments are beautiful, the gameplay of this work resembles what would be an Aliens game made by Infinity Ward and Activision. Yes, this is the Call of Duty of the Aliens franchise. The player is put in the role of Cpl. Christopher T. Winter, a grunt in the USCM. The entire game is an investigation mission that is full of plot holes and paradoxes that conflict with the story from the films that are even acknowledged within the dialogue, but pushed aside by unjustified reasons. If you are not a super fanatic like some, or if you have not seen the movies, the plot in this game may not be so big of a deal.\n\nIn the single player gameplay, you'll find that Call of Duty feeling being revealed in that first, your enemies aren't really xenomorphs at all, they are just lemmings in Halloween costumes. They don't behave anything like a xenomorph really does or how they did in the demo (which is entirely absent from the actual game), being that they hardly use the walls or ceilings as strategic surfaces, and they just run at you not trying their gift of natural stealth at all. This calls for some strange thoughts later on when you realize that you've just mowed down over two hundred of these things that killed a squad of twelve marines without losing many numbers other than to automated turrets. It's also due to the stupidity of these enemies that even a new player could go through the whole campaign on Ultimate Badass mode without being very challenged.\n\nSecond, only three levels of the ten are spent fighting aliens, in the game of the Aliens title. Why is this? Because the other six are focused on fighting Weyland Yutani mercenaries. It really breaks down to being three levels of xenomorphs, three levels of mercenaries, three that are a mix of the two, and the rather disappointing boss "battle" level at the end. The replayability is nearly pointless, as there is no choices or different outcomes to be experienced, and so the only benefit is going back is for achievements (much like Call of Duty), and to complete single player challenges to unlock marine customization pieces.\n\nI can really only award points to the competitive multiplayer game modes. The weapon and character customization of the player's multiplayer marine and three aliens gives some fans one of there virtual fantasies in being able to do so, and on top of that the aliens are acutally difficult as they should be when controlled by other players. The maps are well constructed and the game modes are entertaining, so it deserves good points there, but the multiplayer just cannot make up for the rest of the game. I would reccomend buying this game on a sale if you have the patience.","December 29, 2013","false","40.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are horrible at the highest settings (roughly 2003-4 era graphics), the acting and story is worse than a MST3K movie, and the Aliens are a joke.\n\nI tried, really tried, to give this a go since I got it for basically free and *supposedly* recent patches have improved it....\n\nDon't be fooled, it is still a buggy crapfest. In just 40 minutes of playtime, I encountered five instances where aliens just got stuck and stood still as I blasted them. The aliens, when working, had two modes of attack - climb around the walls like a spaz and never attack me, and run up to me and stand in front of me for (what feels like an eternity) me to shoot in the face. To artificially add difficulty, the aliens basically instantly kill you if you do not have armor (even on the "Soldier" difficulty) and the M41A pulse rifle feels like an airsoft gun. Multiplayer doesn't exist since no one plays this stinker. The game has HORRIBLE lightning (kind of crucial for a horror game...), has terrible quality textures, and the particle system is laughable (big blobs of circular acid, no blood splats that I could see, just bad).\n\nAny positives? The pulse rifle sound was ripped from the movies, and sounds authentic, even if it is way too quiet. The music is decent Aliens music. Michael Biehn got a paycheck, even if his role in the game and performance was...sad. The menu system is clean and kind of neat.\n\nThis game plays like an alpha of a novice developer's 2004 aliens game. After giving up on the game itself, and reading the plot on the web, it just confirms there is zero reason to ever buy, install, or play this game. If someone gifted it to you, return it. If you got it for free, pretend like it doesn't exist. Even AvP 2010 feels like a masterpiece compared to this. Don't waste your time on this game.","December 31, 2013","false","1.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Jerky animations. Clipping models. Convoluted storyline. Bugged cutscenes. Terrible lighting. Horrible hit detection, especially in multiplayer. Bugged enemies, and animations. Multiplayer is a little more polished, with a wide range of appearance customization (my favourite,) for both Marines and Aliens. All Marine weapons are customizable, in skins, accessories, and secondary fire mechanics…But many of the options are repetitive between different guns, leaving the decent sized weapon roster feeling small and bland. Entire fight scenes, missions, and scenarios in trailers and screenshots are missing, or unfinished…One level worth playing, variation of Alien strains, and the fact that I’ve been a fan of the series since I was itty bitty are the only reasons I enjoyed the game at all.","January 9, 2014","false","24.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","5"

Sure, the graphics weren't great, but it was a cool start. Just walking down that space hallway, then it happened. I found that guy, wrapped up in some weird organic mush on the walls. I started to pry him off.. and an alien jumped me! It freaked me out.\n\nBut that wasn't the problem. It.. it ran away. My motion tracker told me it was around the corner, but I couldn't see anything! I reloaded my gun and carefully tip-toed down the hall.. AND THERE IT WAS MAN! JUST SITTING THERE FACING THE OPPOSITE WALL! I screamed and threw my controller down, running out of the room in a panic-- if the very first alien had AI as awful as this, what did that mean for the rest of the game!?\n\n\nOCTOBER 6th: I tried again. I killed the beast and continued playing. We got to the hangar and that was a pretty cool scene. Marines yelling and having to defend the doo--oh.. that.. alien... oh, oh God.

I was so hyped up and such a fan. Seeing the end result of this really makes me wish they just gave the project to someone else or canned development of Borderlands 2 to focus on this. (And I enjoyed my time with Borderlands 2, but I'm a way bigger fan of Aliens)\n\nLike, holy ♥♥♥♥ what happened Gearbox? The single player campaign is sort of a mess. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI and awful textures. Everything feels so rushed. (it probably was) Also an unanswered plot hole introduced by the game. What in the world? This game really could have been so much more...\n\nMultiplayer is slightly buggy but for the most part quite fun to play and probably it's only redeeming quality. You can customize your loadouts and appearances, although loadout customization for Marines isn't anything special outside of changing your gun's alt-fire. I just like being a Colonial Marine. Give this a month or so and I predict multiplayer to be mostly dead unfortunately. Time will tell.\n\nThere is a lot of other stuff that people give this game ♥♥♥♥ for like.... new alien breeds, weapon modifications like reflex sights and voice acting, which you know, to each their own, but didn't bother me. In fact I think it's really just people nitpicking, but whatever. Either way this game is still... not good as a whole product. It's not like the worst thing ever, but it's probably around a 4-5/10 score overall.\n\nEveryone is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this game and in a way, rightfully so (This game got hyped up like crazy by Gearbox) but as an Aliens superfan, I still enjoyed my time with this game. It's a shame that this game is in such shambles because I fear this might mark the end of Aliens video games (not counting Aliens vs Predator, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't care about Predators and would rather they drop that franchise)\n\nIf you are a Alien superfan (particularly if you ever had any interest in extended universe stuff), consider getting this at a very cheap sale price, otherwise you may want to pass.","February 13, 2013","true","20.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

There were times where the suspense was really high and I got startled several times by things creeping around in dark corners. There was the level system that worked perfectly into unlocking weapons and made one want to kill aliens and accomplish achievements to get the experience points to unlock new guns a modifications. And finally, being a fan of the Alien franchise, my inner fanboy squeeled with delight for being able to walk around places I knew from Cameron's Aliens movie.\n\nAnd now for the bad. I'm pretty sure I got the game at a point where all the patches were already pre-installed into the game but it did not make a lot of things better. The graphics were buggy and I adjusted the brightness several times throughout my playthrough. If it wasn't the graphics, certain aspects of the game were still buggy. Sometimes, things would get caught in the walls and I had one crash of the game happen to me. Also, whenever I exited the game, it would just start itself back up again no matter how many times I had to close it. But I think the worse part was that I wasn't able to do multiplayer. Not because it didn't work, but because of bad design and hardly any player base. There is no server list; you are able to select a mode of play and a map and then the game searches for other players who want to play the same mode and map. Problem is there was no one playing and the game required a complete roster of players for the game mode before it started. This was all very frustrating as the multiplayer features had been the primary reason I had purchased the game. I found some groups on steam who organized themselves for multiplayer play on the game. I suppose one could have been able to play multiplayer through that. But I was just frustrated I couldn't play it under normal circumstances so I discontinued playing it and probably won't ever pick it up again.","August 11, 2014","false","17.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's not a bad game by any means but it is rather bland and adds nothing new. If anything it's a cookie cutter FPS game.\n\nThe story line is all over the place and laced with plot holes. If anything the DLC even adds more rather than fixing some. Also these shooty shooty bang bang type dudebro marine type games really miss the whole point of the alien series at heart.\n\nHowever the game has been patched since it's problematic release in 2013 which fixes a lot of issues and with the help of mods you can really polish things up and bring it a little closer to the demo. I'd recommend the cilitbng pack, ENB/Sweet FX mods and Aliens Survival Experience. There's also some great add ons and multiplayer mods that really overhall the experence for online play with more in the pipes.\n\nI do think gearbox should have put out an SDK or modding tools to win back some of the playerbase as well as trust but thats wishful thinking anyway.\n\nIf you are a diehard fan of the alien series you may get some enjoyment out of this, patched up and with some mods it can be fun and it's not badly priced as well.\n\npositives\n*Fairly decent FPS game.\n*Multiplayer can be fun.\n*With some mods it can be polished up a bit.\n*Good price.\n*It does capture some elements of the second movie.\n\nNegatives\n*Textures are really meh at times.\n*Storyline is a mess and full of plot holes.\n*Can be bland at times and really drags out.","November 22, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The reason I am giving it a thumbs up is purely because of how much the game has improved since it was released. The Alien AI is now pretty good bar a few times where they seem to stop a few metres in front of you for a few seconds before they attack again, also they seem to at least attempt to get behind you or climb walls and ceilings to avoid your fire. Unfortunately the only time they jump into vents and stuff seem to be all scripted events. There were even a few moments when the Alien's genuinely scared the crap outta me and the sewer mission where you had no weapons to defend yourself was pretty terrifying, I just wish they had used that a little more.\nThe sound design is also very good, the weapons all sound like they should and so do the aliens. The level design is decent as well, moving from spaceship to planet to colony to alien ship and back again kept the experience quite fresh and interesting and kept the story moving forward at a decent pace.\n\nSo for me the major flaw here is the graphics quality, it does look very old for a 2013 game and I wouldn't consider spending more than a tenner on it but if your like me and wanted to play it just to see if it was as bad as everyone has been saying then I think you will be plesantly surprised.\n\nI would rate this as a 6.5/10 but would have been much higher if the francise had been given the love it deserved.","December 2, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

[Steam, or whoever, please stop ruining games by making Russian language only for certain regions. Just because some Russians live in my country does not mean we do not speak English and will tolerate piece-of-sh***t translations and dubbing; Spent lots of hours searching on forums on changing this game's language - no option in settings].\n\nThis game is actually much better than its scores and completely worth the $2/$3 that it cost during the sales. It has been fixed and having finished the stasis interrupted dlc and first three chapters, I did not encounter any bugs mentioned in reviews (such as the funny one on rock paper shotgun), so they must have fixed a lot of things. Even if I see an alien stuck into the ceiling, I will assume that is realistic too because if one is coming out of walls and ceilings, there is a chance they could get stuck (especially with a full stomach).\n\nGraphics: Maps are well-designed, cut scenes are okay and aliens are not bad (not that different from Dead Space 3 when you come to think abou it). It helps to remove the film grain, turn down brightness and crank up all the settings to max (with sync frame on). The flashlight is a bit weak. 7/10\n\nControls: at first they are a bit clunky and it is hard to learn how to switch between weapons but after some getting used to, they are okay. The tracker is very very useful to track the aliens in the dark. Checkpoints really suck, in some places you have to run through things until the next checkpoint. 8/10\n\nSounds: Voice acting is okay and not terrible in fact; can't expect marines to sound like TV presenters; they should have normal voices; environment sounds are alright too; everything works well in my 5.1 surround sound set-up. Aliens sound better than Halo CE grunts. 8/10\n\nStory: story is average but enough to keep the game going; helps to play statis interrupted dlc first. 6/10\n\n3D: I am playing this game in 3d using tridef's AVP profile; there are some slight fluid lines when you aim down the sights but with the laser sights on it does not matter much. 8/10\n\nCOOP: Tried it in coop campaign with a friend and the story and cut-scenes are well integrated into gameplay. It does not feel like empty maps (as some co-op games feel nowadays). 8/10","December 17, 2014","true","19.0"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

Hell, I think half the gaming community in the world were patiently awaiting Colonial Marines for three long years with bated breath. Would Colonial Marines be THE Aliens game?\n\nCould we finally relive those tense silver screen moments many of us saw well before we were truly old enough to watch something like Aliens? In short, yes but Colonial Marines defiently falls short of what was promised and what was hyped over those three years.\n\nI wanted to like Colonial Marines.\n\nI really did. And in a sense it has been enjoyable. I've been playing it on co-op with mates and it's been good. The biggest gripe I guess from all of us has been the story itself.\n\nThe story starts well enough. You're a Colonial Marine that is woken from cyro, the last of your regiment. Everyone else has been enjoying the corpse party aboard the Sulaco and came face to face with the Alien menace. Many a Marine has been lost and used to increase the enemy ranks.\n\nBut this is just another day in the Corps. You strap up your armour, tie on your boots and throw on that brain dome of a helmet and slap a magazine into your rifle. We've got ourselves a bug hunt.\n\nThe opening is enjoyable and exploring the Sulaco is a feast for the eyes of the avid Aliens fan. And the first mission is what you  expect, kill the Aliens, save your friends and try not to get hugged...\n\nThen the game introduces our friends from Weyland Corps, building us a better future by all of a sudden amassing an army of PMCs. I wanted Colonial Marines to be like the movie, low on ammunition, low on allies but with an abundance of enemies. I just wanted to walk those corridors with my motion track glued to my face waiting for that dreadful contact tone...\n\nOverall Colonial Marines is a game worth playing as an Aliens fan alone and is an enjoyable game when played with mates. However, as a shooter Aliens doesn't bring anything new to the table but it doesn't have any real short falls in terms of a basic shooter.","July 26, 2015","true","16.0"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The game itself is a fanboy's absolute wet dream, having watched Aliens about a milion and 2 times I love all the references.  The gameplay is a bit twitchy but to be honest I've always hated the UT3 engine with a passion.  Its a crap engine, especially for FPS games.  The weapons are perfectly modeled and the sound effects are straight ripped from the film.  I actually find the Aliens themselves way better than previous AVP games as the don't move like ants and when you shoot them they don't just shatter into pieces.\n\nAll in all an awesome movie licence with great atmosphere and tons of upgrades and silly addons for your weaponry.  The biggest downside is : UT3 Engine, so twitchy and overall never works properly.  And Gearbox. I HATE borderlands, even bought the retail game of the year edition and hated it so much I wanted to use it as a drink coaster, so I'm actually GLAD that other companies took over and finished the game.\n\nIts like playing the movie.

Whilst it's not perfect (Evidence of the funding mysteriously dissapearing and being used on borderlands 2 is quite evident in some areas of the game!) It's certinally not "really easy" as people made out. Even on Standard mode, It was quite difficult at times\n\nThe Good :\n\n+ Feels Very Authentic to the Alien films, The Pulserifle especially sounds great\n+ It's own story, not a 'reimagining' of one of the Film plots\n+ You actually play a character, rather than a generic mute character who just goes along with everything\n+ Combat is fun, although grenades are a little awkward to use.\n+ Large choice of weapons\n+ Packed full of references and easter eggs.\n\nThe Bad :\n\n- Some of the checkpointing is god damn awfull. One segment in the first level requires you to fight about 50 aliens, no ammo, health or armour refills along the way, and it's about 15 minutes of gameplay untill the next checkpoint.\n-You glitch out on some of the setpieces, especially rubble and the alien biomass stuff that covers some walls\n-Only one smartgun segment...\n-I understand it's for adding a 'scary' vibe, but the flashlight is basically totally pointless","January 19, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It did sorta not deliver on a few things promised, but when all things are said and done the patches and the DLC make up for whatever was missed in the initial release. It can be buggy at times, but it's not game breaking. It has it's problems and still does, but if you are looking for a fun FPS this will certainly do.","September 20, 2013","true","48.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
