"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PickledJon/recommended/335820/","PickledJon","PickledJon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PickledJon/","286 products in account","Hi, guys.\nI decided to write a review because there seems to be a lot of negative comments on the game from people who tried the game for 5 minutes, got frustrated, and quit. Which, coincidentally, frustrates me.\n\nTL;DR: If you can get past the clunky UI and a few bugs, the class sytem and community are amazing.\n\nFirst things first, this game is one of my favorite games. I have played this game for multiple thousands of hours (before it came out on steam, before this server even existed), so understand that this is coming from someone who knows what they're talking about, but may also be a bit corrupted by my love for it. I will try to be objective, but it is one of my most-played and favorite games.\n\nPros:\nClass System is great, will go into further detail later in the review\nCommunity:The game is by nature very social, when hosted by Aeria was literally called a "Social MMO". Most people tend to be fairly helpful if asked.\nPet System: Pets are cute, and help in combat.\nGraphics: Cel-shaded anime-styled graphics have aged well and look good in a stylized way, in my opinion.\nCrafting: The crafting/upgrading system is fairly simple after you learn the basics.\nRuns on most computers: This game came out in 2005, any computer from the past 5 years should run it easily\nCons\nClunky UI: The UI isn't great. Not even good. Hotkey'd skills are used from the function keys, menus are opened with ctrl+key shortcuts\nSlightly Buggy: There are a few bugs in-game, some that should be fixed shortly, some that probably won't be.\nPoor Translations: The in-game instructions and NPC dialogue can sometimes be pretty strange, because it was originally Chinese\nRNG-loving Host: Suba, the company hosting the game seems to like to use chance boxes.I would like to go in to a few points I mentioned earlier and expand on them, because bulleted points don't really cover the breadth of them.\n\nClass System\nThis game comes with 14 classes, you do simple quests to receive the class "qualification", then you can talk to an NPC to change your class. You can have all classes on one character, and they all level individually. Classes have 3 sets of skills, two tend to be active skills the third is always passive skills. Along with these skill sets, classes come with 2 extra open active and passive slots, where you can drag and drop other classes' skills. Multiclass systems are fairly uncommon in general, and I've never found an MMO with a a class system quite this involved and unique.\n\nCommunity\nThe easiest way to level for most of the game is in a 6-person team. Along with this, the highest level of content is only available to guild parties. By design, the game is very social, and there tends to be a very strong feeling of community. People will often help newbies, crafting them free armor/weapons or giving them pets.\n\nClunky UI/Buggy/Translation Issues\nFor all of these cons, there is a fairly simple explanation. This game was made in 2005, 10 years ago by a Chinese company. Look at the system requirements if you don't believe me. Does that excuse them? Not really, but it does give some context for them. In my experience, though, most people who put a little bit of time in can get past these issues.\n\nIf you managed to read this far, congratulations, you've finished my review.\n\nTL;DR: If you can get past the clunky UI and a few bugs, the class sytem and community are amazing.","August 16, 2015","true","0.6"," 164 of 187 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","164","187","12","9"

When they're a high enough level you can evolve them, and most you can mount and ride. and they're so cuute\n-You can switch to any class once you've unlocked it.  There's your main class, and 2 sub classes; which means you can level your Blademaster with Doctor and Mercenary abilities subbed. Having a doctor sub class being able to heal and buff yourself while soloing or any situation was one of the many aspects I looked forward to come back to.\n-Not Pay2Win\n-TONS of outfits and accesories you can mix and match\nThe game mostly focuses on PVE, but there are arenas and a duel system\nLeveling while soloing is pretty slow, but if you find a party for a dungeon you'll level like crazy\nThere is a flagging system where parties can find you, or you can find the person you need to fill your party. class and level is listed.\nAlchemy is really addicting, you farm,fish, mine etc for the mats, or can buy them off other players stalls\nThis was my first review but I hope its of help. this game is really fun and there's lots to do other than quests\n","August 14, 2015","true","2.9"," 144 of 177 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","144","177","9","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Turboencabulator/recommended/335820/","Turboencabulator","DownAndUnder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Turboencabulator/","322 products in account","Quick guide with some tips and for some problems some seem to be having:\n\n1.You can set  WASD movement in options if you don't like clicking.\n\n2.You can go full screen window mode at your screen resolution by going in image and selecting first option from the resolution list it should auto-adjust to whatever your screen resulotion is.\n\n3.Getting out of the starter area takes only a few minutes, just read what npcs say or just speak to the eversun teleporter, I know it's a lost art but you can do it believe in you! (Also it seems people are saying Sprite race is bugged and unable to get out of spawn, however I was able to make a sprite character and get him out of spawn and into eversun no problem)\n\n4.Game is slow and only picks up pace once you reach lvl 15 and get flying weapons. At level 10 you can get all jobs. I suggest picking up doctor first and level it a bit to gain healing skills to use with all your other jobs. For quick leveling to lvl 15 I suggest picking up dancer job as it's the earliest job that will grant you powerfull aoes for super fast early leveling (And maybe a pocket full of dirty cash) .\n\n5.NEVER trust the pink line! It's a trap.\n\n\nPlayed the game way back for years, it was awesome for the time.\n\nFrom what I have seen, it hasn't changed much since suba has taken over.\nThis game is an old school mmo based on social interaction rather than just farming mobs and getting drops like 99 % of all mmos out there.\n\n\n\nPros:\n-Cute and light hearted graphic style based on chinese mythology.\n-Very versatile class system where you can get all class at the same and mix and match by choosing one main job and then choosing different skill paths to add to your play style from your other jobs. Each job levels independently point. Making it easy to join all kind of level ranges to play with your friends of different levels. Perfect game for anyone who hates gender locks, race locks, character locks or class locks.\n- 2 main story quests filled with old gen hilarious and messy cutscenes.\n-You can catch mostly all enemies pokemon style on top of the regular pet system with evolutions for egg based pets (Pets are totally OP in this game) They can also become mounts and flying mounts as well as used for super fast grinding for your lower level jobs.\n-Game relies on a crafting system that is actually essential to the game and encourages exploration and social interaction. Pots with recipes are scattered around the game making it a challenge for low level characters to venture into much higher level areas to try and nab recipes. Durability and max durability is finite and will crumple down with time, making material gathering and alchemists indispensable for fast cheap weapons and armor especially in late game.\n-The game relies a lot on quests and objectives that will make you activly seek out other players.\n-EXP gain is based on damage done rather than enemies killed. (Which is a way better system in my opnion) So if you are about to be killed while the enemy is almost dead, you can run away without the frustrating feeling of having wasted your time.\n-Seems like alot of server based events are still running.\n-Female shura heavy armor bare bottoms.\n\nCons:\n-Lack of options for grapchis/chat/fonts/etc.\n-Stylized yet very dated graphics and poor drawing distance.\n-Game is slow and grindy in most parts you will be spending hours just vaccuming up all enemies into a perpetual mob grinding machine called a "party", just chatting away, or doing whatever(pron? i don't know you but im pretty sure it's pron. Isn't it?).\n-Lack of end game content.\n-There is no super rare drops/weapons/armor or anything, this game is mostly about collecting recipes and materials.\n-Some very outdated systems regarding items, item management and so on.\n-Underwear quest is tedious.\n-Pink lines.\n\n\nI would recommend it for you just to check out the skill/class system, but I doubt this game will have any longetivity in the long run.","August 17, 2015","true","4.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","39","44","7","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/starlightgaming/recommended/335820/","starlightgaming","Estrellita","http://steamcommunity.com/id/starlightgaming/","31 products in account","I played this game back in 2007. It's great to see it back. But that doesn't mean it's back without problems.\n\nI'll get the cons out of the way because I know everyone's going to look for the worst first.\n\nCONS What is lag? Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more... - You can expect an inconsistent connection, every 30-60 minutes\nAll by myyyseeeeelf - Small population, but I'm sure if enough people play it, it'll bounce back\nMan, I feel like a woman - Some NPCs are mislabelled, probably due to a translation error (King Collet has boobs... I uh... I guess if they want to have boobs and be a man, who am I to judge though?...), and you can expect plenty translation errors in general\nWhich way did he go George, which way did he go - You might have use of WASD keys if you're lucky - if you're like me, you won't and will be clicking to move; in general, all the keys and controls are kind of messed up. You're stuck using your F-keys for skills, which sucks, but there's nothing you can really do about it. Don't make the mistake of hitting CTRL+M, because if you have my luck, it'll move your skills, close your mini map, open a large map, open the world map, and open your settings all at once...\nI meant what I said and I said what I meant... DOMO's chat is messed up 100%! Yeah. Uh. Shift changes the chat you're talking in, so you might get distracted while typing if you have to hit SHIFT and see it start to switch over to the global chat. Additionally, the word filter is a little overeager. (assess and grass are not profane, y u have a lazy filter, lrn2regexPLS!)\nGlitch in the Matrix - There's not much variation among characters of the same race. Unfortunately but true. There's some customization, but not nearly enough.\nThere you go, all the negatives. If you read that and went "ehh... nvm" then you're missing out on all the great stuff listed below.\n\nPROS Size doesn't mean everything - Yeah, the playerbase is small, but everyone's amazingly friendly. I started playing it again today in the first time in years and some people stopped me to ask if I needed help with a quest. At level 8, the answer was yes. They added me as friends and went on their way after. Very common to get into light conversation too\nI... have... THE POWERRRR - to multiclass. Yes, you can multiclass. You don't have to pay real money to multiclass. You don't have to do some extreme ritual to multiclass. And the classes are all distinct and fun. And you can have a primary class with a secondary class\nHi hoooooo - If you find the recipe, you can make pretty much every item you require in the game. Self Sufficiency +1\nOnce upon a time... - ... a game was made with an actual plot and story line. That you can ignore to do questing if you really want to, but the story's there!\nI'm flying (flying, flying, flying!) - Level 15 you're able to get an item that lets you fly... and it costs you no real-world money\nI will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him... - There's also pets! Also don't cost real-world money, yay pet system!\nThis is just a partial list. I implore you to take the time to get off Newbie Island (there is a different Newbie Island for each race) and play for about 30 minutes after leaving there before judging the game. Overall, I rate this Social MMO a 7.8/10. And that's with all of those cons.","November 25, 2015","true","3.9"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","32","35","13","0"

It will open the steam overlay after a little popup and it will want you to register an account with the company's website, which should only take a minute.\n\nThe actual game will start with you making a character. There are four races, humans, sylphs, shuras, and sprites. Humans are probably well-rounded, not specializing in anything. Sylphs are probably best in magic, Shuras are best in like melee weapons, and sprites are best in ranged or something, I don't know. The customization isn't bad, its what you would expect from a cartoony MMO, some faces, some hairstyles, a few colors, and you can change the size of your head and parts fo your body.\n\nThe first thing that happens in the game is kind-of a cutscene in which some guy tells you the world is messed up or something. When you're in the game, the first thing you may notice is no WASD movement. You can enable WASD in the options on the bottom right of the screen, thank God. The first quests I did were to slaughter some pigs ruthlessly for some village elders. It kinda bugged me how when a NPC is talking to you, you can't open your status tabs or anything like that. The main gist of the Shura story is that thy were once dragons but then they were cursed and now they are quickly dying out. I suppose each race has its own main story.\n\nSo far, its a pretty alright game, but its pretty basic. you click on something, and you don't stop attacking until its dead. The game runs great, even on my horrible PC. Its a quick download and should be given a chance if you're bored. I'm barely into it though.","August 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 61 of 88 people (69%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","69","61","88","9","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LunarD3ATH/recommended/335820/","LunarD3ATH","LunarD3ATH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LunarD3ATH/","294 products in account","EDIT: I've been informed that you can turn on WASD movement somewhere in the options and that there are four hotbars for abilities. I assume they are the bars at the top-right that seemed to have emotes in them.\n\nLet me give an initial look at the game through my eyes during my first start-up of this MMO and you can decide whether it's worth the hassle to you.\n\n(((Skip to the bottom if you want a simple bullet list of pros and cons.)))\n\nI downloaded the game and booted it up. Oddly, though, I had a very thin window for the game, but long enough that it went under my taskbar and hid some options. As I had little way to fix this, I had to go to the discussion boards and (luckily) found someone with a post on it. They suggested hitting Ctrl + N to open up the resolution options.\n\nI then proceeded to enter the game and set my resolution, but unfortunately there wasn't one for my monitor (1366 x 768), so I tried one that was close enough and chose the fullscreen variant of said resolution. For some reason the game decided that "Fullscreen" meant "No Border" and I could still see my desktop to the right. This wasn't acceptable, so I just chose a small resolution that wouldn't reach the edges of my screen (top, bottom, left OR right).\n\nNot wanting to judge a game purely on technical difficulties, I decided I'd jump into the game itself and make my character.\n\nNo real issues there. I just made my account as the game wanted and it automatically linked it to my Steam account. Simple as can be. I then proceeded to create a Sylph and got into the game itself.\n\nNow here's where things are a little more annoying.\n\n1. The chat menu is constantly active. That's right, you can't use WASD to move around or it'll just type it.\n2. The abilities (if there are any) are nowhere on the screen. I hovered over all the menus, but there wasn't a hotbar for spells/abilities, so I have to assume either I hadn't unlocked them or there just aren't any. (I only reached 3, so it's likely I just didn't have any. I just find it odd that there isn't a hotbar at all.)\n\nI don't expect World of Warcraft quality controls, but the above two are a tad bit of a problem for me.\n\nGameplay-wise, I have to say the game isn't bad. It seems like any other basic MMO and the graphics are simple with decent animations. I don't worry too much about graphics, though, so maybe most wouldn't agree that they're "nice". I think they are.\n\nI ended up relying on clicking to go places because for some reason right-clicking DOES drag the camera, but doesn't hold the cursor in place like you would think.\n\nAt first I clicked on the wrong NPC and got a chat bubble above their head and nothing. I thought I was doing something wrong until I remembered I was supposed to talk to some "Grandpa" character. I don't know whose grandfather he is, but not mine.. I think.\n\nAfter accepting the quest, it seemed to obstruct my view of the chat bubble with its confirmation "Quest Thingy Here Accepted" and I looked past that and moved on.\n\nThen I killed a few piggies (Click and your character moves to them and attacks. Nothing special.) called "Pupu" and turned in their bones for a reward. Whatever reward that was, I am not sure.\n\nMy next quest led me to a tailor and I found him by his giant name on the map at the top-right, which is convenient, as there doesn't seem to be any sort of directional quest-tracker (WoW doesn't have this either, which can be dismaying for new players, but you can click the map to find things).\n\nThe tailor asked me to collect something from "flying Pupus" but I decided I wasn't going to invest more time in the game. The small window was a big factor, but the controls weren't helping.\n\nEnd of story? Update your product before releasing it on Steam.\n\nMMOs should constantly try to improve, both technologically and visually (the latter doesn't have to be 60fps Modded Skyrim graphics, just better models or lighting).\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nPros\n- Nice Graphics\n- Smooth Animations\n- Functional Gameplay\n\nCons\n- Limited Resolution Options\n- No Hotbar\n- Minor UI Complaints\n- Limited and Unimaginative Race Options (Mage-like Thin Race, Brawny Fighter Race, Child Race, Humans)\n\nRecommend?\n\nI'm going to say no, but I want to say that if any of the complaints I've made seem minor to you, I would actually recommend giving it a shot. I've heard some interesting things about the game (pets that level with you, growing in power and eventually becoming mounts) and combined with the simple anime look, I think the game could be fun if you invest time in it or play with friends.\n\nIf you're not data-capped on your internet, there's no reason why you couldn't download the game, give it a whirl, and come up with your own conclusion. I'm just trying to give you a heads-up on what to expect.\n\nSorry if it seemed like a long read!","August 14, 2015","false","0.4"," 193 of 327 people (59%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","59","193","327","18","28"

The class system is nothing I have ever seen before or since. You can level up all 14 classes on the same character (classes open up at lvl 10), and you can mix and match their skills. You can sub 2 skill groups from other jobs to our current one.\n\nThe maps are decent sized but with flying available from lvl 15 and teleports to all cities getting around is easy. For the lazier or richer folks there are the item mall Teleport to Parties or Go Anywheres. If you are bored of murdering creeps hourly events can keep you entertained (quiz show/treasure hunt/pupu darts/flying race etc.) for quite some time.\n\nPets are an other highlight of the game. Other than they help you fight with each having their strength and weaknesses once you level and evolve them to lvl 61 they can become mounts (both riding and flying). Riding a huge metal bear or flying on a winged cat (my personal favourite) are both great. Or if you so prefer get one of the cute/handsome humanoid pets. ;)\n\nIt is true there are technical issues and things the game can improve on. However several of the negatives have a sollution ready if people were willing to look around.\n- WASD is available from options\n- Screen resolution can be fixed in the game files\n- The font the game uses can be downloaded to fix the text issue lot of people has\n- Start village is instanced, that is why you do not see anyone, the game is not a ghost town\n- While only a few hair colours are available from the character creation you can buy a lot more later from the Item Mall or other players.\n\nItem mall is just what you would expect from a free to play game. XP and loot boosters, luxury items and of course countless cosmetics.\n\nAs for end game there are several guild based raids with billboards to show off your times (while pocketing loot) and compete with other guilds. If you are the bloodthirsty kind you can also hop in the Arena for some PvP action (also with billboard). Or, if you are one of the clumsy you can try climbing the death billboard. :)\n\nThere are no perfect or bugless games. But if you really want to give DOMO a try there is a way to run it without most of the issues mentioned in reviews. Please keep in mind the game is old, and due to that it cannot race with modern games in a lot of aspects. Should you like it the main concern would be how long the developer (SoftStar) will support such an old game.\n\nIf you want some nostalgy, or want to have something to pass time with give it a try.\n\nName any other game where your cup size is a game mechanic. 10/10","August 16, 2015","true","452.7"," 47 of 74 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","47","74","3","0"

It's visual style is unique somewhat and charming as well.  It's engrish and overall theme is silly and that gives it some strange charm as well.   It's also not very straining at all if you're still unfortunate enough to be using a toaster in this day an age as your gaming computer.\n\nActual gameplay wise, it's still dated and generic but I'm sure there are people out there who prefer it over the overly complicated and unique setups.  Click and kill, go here go there, grind for exp or loot.   Something you can do and not have to heavily focus on or dedicate super hard to.  The ingame classes and races are the usual things you see.  Not exactly bad I'd say, but its nothing super new or super unique.\n\nSettings and such are not the most open ended in what people look for in this day and age.  Oddly the game's ingame music is muted on start up so you have to turn that on/up to get that back.   Also there is WASD controls avaliable if needed.  Just need to toggle em in the settings, but this locks out the click movement.  So sadly, its one or the other.

It has been in Open beta since March, and has only now been added to Steam. This game features 14 playable character classes, allows you to sub skills from other classes, customize your stat builds, and has an enjoyable anime style graphics. There is also an item mall that allows you to purchase pets which you can level and evolve along with your character, along with other novelty items and experience boosters. HOWEVER, the absolute one negative I can say about this game in terms of the cash shop: Do NOT buy SP through Steam: they are overcharging well beyond what you would get if you purchase your SP through the SubaGames site instead. For the most expensive package, Steam is charging $80 for 65K SP, while buying from Suba directly nets you 100K SP for the same $80.","August 14, 2015","true","122.7"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","27","43","2","0"

This actually makes me a little upset, as to this day, this game remains one of my favorite mmos.  I understand its not perfect, and I also understand a lot of the launch problems are partially due to crappy default options.  I'll go over how to fix the main issues i found first.  Honestly, I feel like Suba dropped the ball a little bit, but hopefully, it wont ruin the experience that much if you know how to handle it.\nOne of the main complaints that I see, and actually came across myself, was the screen going below the start bar.  This makes it so you can't access the options panel to fix said screen resolution.  A real problem.  To fix this, press Ctrl+n in game to bring up the options menu and change the resolution from there.  My personal favorite is Windows-Full screen, which resizes the window to exact area of your screen minus the start bar. Feel free to pick whatever works for you.\nLet's fix another complaint I see a lot: lack of sound.  This game has a beautiful soundtrack (obviously my opinion, but still).  However, for some reason, the music defaults to muted.  You can go ahead and fix that in the sound options while you have the menu open.  No big deal.\nOther random stuff I want to address: The character creation in this game IS good...if you look at it a certain way.  There are four races and genders, and while they are all basically 'humanoid', they're fine as they are really.  When I hear people talk about lack of customization options in this game, I think they must be talking about face and hair styles, for which each race and gender has only 5.  However, this is the only game I've played that gave full character proportion control to the player.  Not only that, but the Eversun Elder quests make these decisions early on important.  In the end, you're left with what can only be described as 'your character'...and really, that's exactly what it's supposed to do.  It's not as great as it could be, but I've seen much, much worse...\nNow that Sound and Image are fixed, lets continue down to controls.  This is where you can turn on ASWD if that is you prefered gaming style.  This will deactivate your chatbox, and make it so you can use the keyboard to move.  For the record, even if you have ASWD off, the arrow keys on the keyboard will move your character just fine. Anyway, fine tune the rest of the options as you want.  After all, the key is for you to enjoy it.\nNow on to the review proper.  I'll start by saying, DoMO is one of those games that requires team work and patience from the get go.  And I don't just mean in repetative questing (but, yeah, that too). One monster in the well that is required for a title spawns once every 45 minutes to an hour.  The best option is to team up so everyone gets the title...and wait for it to spawn...and wait...and wait... Grinding is a staple in mmos, and its in full force here.  There is no real easy way to get experience as a soloer past a certain point.\nWaiting might sound like a pain, but in a way, its brilliant.  When your forced to wait collectively in a group for long stretches of time, inevitably, bonds will be formed.  I have met so many people through this game over the last 3 years, and the strongest bonds I have are with my guild mates, who kept me company over time that i otherwise would have been fiddling my fingers... My point here is, join a guild.  Any guild is fine.  A good, active guild, even if they aren't in a team with you, will keep you entertained even when the game itself slows down.\nWhat's that? Sounds like a lot of time you don't have? That's fine.  Even a casual player can find value in game as an alchemist.  The crafting in this game, while not always making sense (The only thing that is used to make a wooden sheild...is glass...) is pretty easy to figure out.  Weapons and armor are made using monster drops and Collection items.  Collection includes Mining, Meditation, Fishing, etc. and can easily be done while your away doing your business (I'm collecting iron bars myself right now actually).  When collection is done, you can use your items for crafting, or sell you finds to other players.\nOh, and there are currently 13 classes in game...should prolly mention that.  You start the game as a commoner, and have to make it to lvl 10 before you can earn any of the other ones.  During this time, you'll learn no attack skills, but just getting thru the tutorial area should get you somewhere between 6-8 easily.  Completing the Eversun Guide missions when you reach the city should easily get you high enough for your first job.  There are 3 rows of hot keys for a reason.  While you have a main job equiped, you can substitute jobs from other classes to help you out.  I recommend learning doctor skills early, so you can sub a healing spell for whenever you need it.  Not all skill work the same on every class, and many skill require certain weapons that your main job may not be able to equip by default.  However, with enough grinding, technically you can use any skill on any job to some degree.  Finding your favorite class and sub combination can be a game all in itself.\nI feel like I've devolved into ranting... so final thoughts:  This game is NOT perfect.  If you want proof, ask anyone in game about the stairs... However, for what it is, DoMO is an enjoyable experience, especially if you choose to take part in the community.  I may be disappointed in the Suba launch on Steam, but I still recommend people at least try this game.  It might not have the flashiest graphics, or the fastest action, or extreme whatever, but in terms of a nice, slow way to enjoy a day, this is one of my favorite options.\n\n-Timreh","August 15, 2015","true","116.2"," 28 of 45 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","28","45","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miantra/recommended/335820/","Miantra","Pyrithe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Miantra/","248 products in account","So first thing I'm going to do here is cover the negatives of the game, firstly that there are some issues regarding stairs which likely won't be fixed.  Seems more noticeable if you play the Sylph race (which happens to be my race, yay -.-)  Aside from that, the combat seems simple, the emotes are a bit lacking, if the game crashes, any ui or options you changed revert (you can use the /saveui command to prevent that and force save your keybindings and such), the Steam version seems to crash a lot and the linking page issue, and there's a good chance you'll be starring in tentacle porn when you meet Supergrass.\n\nNow that those are out of the way, the game is very charming, the graphics are old, but stylishly so, the class system is unique while a few jobs should probably be renamed in my opinion (Wizards should be Priests, Doctors should be Vampires >.>), the community is great, sure we get a few nuts here and there, but for the most part, everyone is very helpful and if they can aid you, likely will.  There is a relationship system that adds various abilities which can be triggered if certain conditions are met, the item shop is mostly items you can live without, aesthetic items, and pets, but there are plenty of people who often sell some cash shop items through their own stalls.  It's a huge game with lots to do, it's not all about fighting monsters.  People who like business and making money can utilize the Commoner and Merchant classes as well as alchemy to create items to sell, people who like playing games can often join events that happen frequently throughout the day, if you enjoy hunting for treasure, you can get treasure maps and find chests with tons of booty (buy yourself a pirate costume and be a Blade Master to complete the pirate theme, arr!), if you prefer just hanging out, you can just chill in town and talk with people through Broadcast like a giant chatroom, if you like hunting big monsters, there's plenty of those lying around.  If you like being strategic or designing unique class sets, you can do that as well, mix and match any class with other class skills until you find that perfect combination you like.  If you enjoy cosplaying, plenty of characters can be designed through cash shop costumes, in-game armors, and even mixing classes together to complete your characters skills.\n\nSo you should certainly try this game if you want something more relaxed and with a good community.  What I mentioned are in-game things, but some guilds add to the list doing various things and also giving you a group of instant friends who share a similar interest as you.  Some prefer doing stuff like hunting big monsters and being the best (like Prestige) others are just more friendly and prefer hanging out (like Muffins).\n\nAnd insert shameless plug here:  I'm working on my own guild as well called the Crimson Clerics, to pick up where Rifa'iya  (http://rifaiya.tripod.com/index.html) left off many years ago.  It's a large-scale operation guild focused on helping the populace with 5 sections of assistance:  Military to hunt down newbie killers like Leech Lich and Supergrass, Teachers to find newbies in town and help them out, teaching them how to play the game, Item Management which will focus on getting items, finding/creating equipments to help people, Guild Management which will put efforts into helping level and expand the guild (as well as recruitment), and Events which will focus on setting up in-guild and out-of-guild events, anything from setting up a play to entertain people to running newbie help events where we sell cheap newbie equipment and help people with finding a career they can be proud of.","August 24, 2015","true","577.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

The game is originally from 2006, so people should stop comparing it to new games - for me the graphics are great, i love it's style and everything about it.\n\nI recommend using the window-mode, as there might be some issues with the fullscreen (not-windowed) mode. It also allows you to drag around the game-window on your screen, what is a plus for me (i like to watch anime/series on the same screen i'm playing at).\nThe game starts with an tutorial, that is very informing when you actually take a few minutes and read trough it.\nWhat i've read often in the negative reviews is that the game starts without WASD-movement. Well, when you read this before you start the game and you are a fan of wasd: use ctrl + N to open the actions (or click on the down-right button in the menue), go to control and enable the wasd-movement.\n\nThe game has 4 races that distinguish only in looks, and so far 14 implemented different classes (jobs) to play. The player starts with the basic job: commoner. The commoner is the only class without active skills, because this class is bound to the crafting-system in the game. It allows your to level your alchemy (crafting skill), or material-collection skills. Once lvled to lvl 10, you can qualify for the other jobs via quests, and start the "real game". There are tank-classes, sorcerer/mage, healer/support, and of course dps/damage dealer, so everyone can find his/her passion. Now the Jobsystem gives everyone the opportunity, to lvl each job seperatly, and sub-equip the skills from another class (e.g. once learned, you can use the doctor's healing skills on another class to heal yourself).\nBesides all the classes, the player can own pets that support the player when fighting and represent the main classes as well: there's mage pets (ruby, sapphire pet), tank (jade, metal pet), blademaster (rock pet) and support (love pet).\n\nI advise everyone who wants to try out this game: please don't judge it after playing like 10 minutes, as it takes a while to get used to it in the very beginning.","August 16, 2015","true","477.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

Even though Steam says I've only played this game for half an hour, it doesn't account for all the time I spent on it when the game was new, nearly ten years ago.  I have some pretty fond memories of playing it with my friends, but it was in the barrage of all the different MMOs we tried together and we didn't really tend to stick with any of them all that terribly long.\n\nA lot of the MMORPGs from that time played similarly and bled together to the point you really couldn't tell that much of them apart, and while DOMO was no exception to that, I liked it for its unique job system.  You can change jobs at any time in the game, level up that particular job enough to learn skillsets from that job permenantly and use them with other jobs.  Essentially, it's a game where you hybridize your job classes, much like Final Fantasy V.\n\nThat being said, there's really not much else that sets this game apart from other MMORPGs, and it suffers for that now as much as it did then.  So it's not just that it's dated (though it most certainly is), it was just never that interesting to begin with.  The job system was great, the game itself just wasn't strong enough to support it.  For a while, the North American server cancelled the game and it could only be played in Europe and other regions, so it's frankly kinda surprising to me to see it on Steam all these years later.\n\nWould I recommend it?  Sure, but it's not for everyone, and it probably won't appeal to many people anymore.  But it does have flirty zombies.  That alone might make the game worth playing for, at least for a little while.","August 16, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Even though it lacked in some areas but made up for in others. The class system aka "Job" was clean cut and clear as how to where to do this and that, there are plenty of party quest and hard dungeons that make a party important, each class compliments each other. Customizable races are also pretty fun to muck around with at the beginning like making little Sprites have big ti... AHEM, MOVING ON! The game provides many challenges to take on, which can take you on adventures from one to place to another. LAST BUT NOT LEAST, how could I forget the pet system, the pets are absolutlely adorable, though the down side is that they take like a million years to level up BUT when you do manage to hit level 61 for the pet and mount it, I guess it sort of makes it worth while having an amazing pet. Honestly, when this game shut down, I really thought this was the end for such an amazing game, there were plenty fo bugs to be fixed but it was still great none the less, but to be re-released AND TO BE ON STEAM, it's like a dream come true.","August 15, 2015","true","8.0"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","0"

And worse, you have to AFK again to sell them materials to players. Despite being a quite-hardcore MMORPG gamer, it's still hard to gain money only from selling loots. Because of this, many used double client to AFK farming material while the other client hunt/chat/whatever (which I don't want to do because I love my laptop!)\n\nAs a solo doctor I find it very hard to gear up, and the cash costumes are not permanent except for those in GACHA boxes which is a super big minus. (Yes, you might get trash from said box.)\n\nI liked the art, story and change job system. Unlike other reviews the old UI is no problem to me. It's an old game after all. But if I have kill my laptop by being AFK for days, I'll have to pass.","October 3, 2015","false","8.4"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","5"

Why? Like everyone has said, once you can get used to the bugs and clunky Ui, it's really not that bad of a game.\n\nWhat makes this a game that I highly recommend is the community. Many people there are very nice and willing to help if you are willing to ask for it. Within the first few hours of playing I was able to get some help and make a couple of friends. As a veteran of another MMO, Mabinogi, having played for almost 7 years, that didn't happen there in my newbie days. At all. I find a friendly community to be invaluable when it comes to mmo's nowadays. This game is rather aged, a diamond from the past in a sense, however, but if you think about it, it was almost ahead of it's time back then. The graphics are decent given it's age.\n\nAs for gameplay, well. It can get grindy, especially with the loop quests but that's ok, the fun part is getting into parties to wipe bosses out. And there's about 15 different classes but once you hit level 10, you literally can choose whatever you want and not be bound to them. There's also the option to make a secondary class as well, which means, let's say you want to be a doctor but also a dancer. You can train your doctor skills for the healing then you can switch classes and have the doctor class be the secondary, with your healing available.\n\nAnd so my TL;DR version:\n\nPros:\n- Decent graphics and animations for it's age\n- Friendly community\n- 15 classes to choose from without being bound to any of them\n- Decently large maps\n- Faster traveling with "flying"\n- Pet system/Taming system\n\nCons:\n- Clunky UI\n- Some bugs and crashing\n- No option to turn the "Red thread of Fate" effects off\n- Quirky flying controls\n\nNow I'm only lv 17 in game atm, but from what I've seen this is my review, even on short term, I recommend giving it a try if you can be patient enough with the bugs and ui.","August 19, 2015","true","118.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I used to play it while it was published and hosted by Aeria Games.\n\nPros: -Interesting Class and Job Systems\n-Nice art style with low system requirements\n-Fair amount features while still remaining simplistic\n-In depth alchemy system for item crafting healing items and armor\n-Nostalgic for older players\n-Automatic looting settings for those in a party (dice roll based, but limited to only party members nearby, so the guy whose AFK on the other side of the map won't steal your materials)\n-In depth guilds, with ranking system and guild base\n-PvP combat via duel requests\n-No longer\n\nCons: -Poorly written (or at least poorly translated) main questline\n-Servers for different countries are rarely used because they just join the US/Canada Server, there's a lot of people who barely even speak english (ie, just got PMed "are you want buy my saphire pet")\n-Poor connection to servers, even with best connection speeds\n-Character customization is limited\n-Generic MehMO at it's core, with all the issues coming with it\n-Pets are expensive but just as powerful as a player, usually breaking the PvP system (ie, Players summoning pets mid fight and running away)\n-You spend most of the time AFK to either gather resources or selling the left overs you didn't need\n-In game economy, with players choosing the prices of most items that you can't buy from NPCs (for better or worse)\n-Low player base, most being either anti-social or rude, very few friendly faces until they need something from you\n-Slow experience gains past level 25, over level 35 and beyond and an agonizing grind-fest\n-Alchemy made items have slight stat boosts compared to NPC bought versions, feeling over powered at higher level alchemy skills\n-A lot of items can only be bought from players or in the cash shop for real money\n\nFinal Score: Nostalgia/10 (I'd give it a 2.5/5 stars)","March 5","false","17.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The art style makes up for what it lacks in graphics. The game is colorful, but doesn't give you a headache. The game is also unique in that you can become qualified for all classes, and switch whenever you want. The music is also rather unique, and I love it.\nCons: The text is VERY small, however, this can be fixed by downloading a font called Mingliu, which can be downloaded safely and for free from FontPalace, as I did. (Edit: The font is specifically called Mingliu Regular). The game is prone to crashing often and every time you tab out. There is no quest tracker in the UI (but you do have a journal to keep track of current quests). There is no solo auto-loot. It's easy to get caught on the terrain, especially stairs and curbs. Sometimes monsters walk through the walls, though this poses no problem in hitting them and dragging them back out. From my knowledge, you cannot buy perma-costumes from the item mall (but I'm fairly certain I've seen some perma-costumes in player shops, though I don't know how they got them). Lastly, the only way to know how an item is usually priced if you're wanting to sell it in your own shop is to either ask others or check other shops and hope they have it.\nOverall I really love the game and its uniqueness, maybe just because of the nostalgia, but I really recommend it, because if you can get past the cons, the game is truly fun and lovable.","May 6","true","279.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Classes can be changed after picking one so that the player can see and try out which class he'll enjoy the most.\nThe game's been revived due to fans demand, and it's understandable why they would want it back. The game's simplicity and it's similarity with other click-based MMOs can take anyone's who's into them (or were) back into a reminiscing stage of their life and make them play it.","August 15, 2015","true","3.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Partying up for a good grind is much more enjoyable -- relaxing between punching sessions nets some fun conversations and memorable moments, and joining a guild makes for the opportunity to establish real connections with some of these people.

Which is another problem I've found, there's not set full screen you have to guess at it when you select full screen and even then most of the options don't work because they aren't compatibal with your computer. I played this game for a little while and became nausiated and suffered a headeache because i was struggling to read the text, and for me that a huge deal because i wear glasses to help with that problem and i still had to get really close to my screen and squint and try to guess as what was being said. It hurt my back trying to attempt this and I did take to the comunity to try and fix the text problem by looking at what others had done to fix this issue but nothing they were giving me worked. That wasn't the only problem i found this game though, now before you bite my head off hear me out because i will be fair about this. On the side of reason there are a lot of games that don't give you the option of character customization and there are also a lot of games that have very minimalistic customizations when it comes to characters. *coughs* Fiesta *coughs* and with that being said before i could get far into the game before i had to quite because of the problems it caused me medically i had the feeling that this was going to be one of those games where you were going to have to pay really world money in order to customize your character even more like a few other games i know *cough* fiesta again *cough* and for me while i doesn't detract too much from the over all game play from an asthetic stand point it's rather annoying and well i dislike it because it put a monetary restriction on character originality.\nAll in all Domo is a.....decent game i guess to say the least from what i've seen but it really needs some help in terms of font size and maybe some more customizations features though i know that is unlikely since this seems to be a pretty old game and they don't usually revamp games as old as these too often.","August 15, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

It's awkward, dull, and definitely needs better hotkeys. I hate that the chat is always open and I can't find a way to turn it off. It makes playing difficult and downright frustrating. The fact that there's not even background music is boring. If I wanted to move from one objective to the next in complete silence I would mute my volume. They have some sound effects, but they seem pretty hit and miss to me. It looks like they tried to add sound effects, got about half of them in and then gave up. You might as well have not put them in at all. Having to hit awkward hotkeys to open my inventory and skills (ctrl-D and ctrl-X respectively...) makes me need extra time to do a simple task. Not good in my books.\n\nWhile it's certainly not great, it's also not terrible. The graphics are nice, I will admit that. It's bright and colorful and cheerful looking. If they added some nice cheerful music in the background I would probably like it a lot more. The animations do run smoothly, as other players have noted. Playing the game is possible, but it's awkward.\n\nOverall I find the game lacking, despite some nice points. It needs a lot of work (if it will even get any done, considering how old it is) to even be fully functioning. At the present moment I do not reccomend this game to anyone.","August 16, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

First of all, to play on steam you have to connect to an account for Suba with your Steam ID. Now this is fine, whatever. It is a problem if the game for the first few tries just refuses to load the page to allow you to connect. At first I thought I had to go to the website to connect but nope. The game is just buggy. Next, in the game you can move arouond by clicking, using the arrow keys, or by turning on WASD movement in the controls menu. That's 3 ways to move your character but the only way to move the camera is by right-click and dragging which is annoying to do especially since the mouse pointer doesn't stay still while you do it so god forbid you're stuck using a smaller window than your screen (because that's the only way to be able to keep buttons from being beneath the task bar) because you'll have to spend extra time which is key in actual battles in games click-drag-release-click-drag-release in order to see what you're doing. So I'm done. Also for what it's worth this game looks like a more cluttered version of pretty much any basic MMO.

A lot has changed since then; unfortunately games like this have not. In addition to the very stiff controls {I'm not talking movement which can be changed in the Options with the WASD toggle}; I found that the game pace was very slow. So I settled on playing through what I thought was a good pace, following quests; killing level equivalent monsters; etc. I only found out that this is not the best way to level to the point of acquiring your first job and in fact adds on another 30-40 minutes of un-necessary exposition and needless gameplay. But that can be overlooked; because let's face it, no game company wants their games considered to be fast paced anymore.\n\nBut that wasn't what bothered me; what actually bothered me was the somewhat estranged fact that despite having a Quest Tracker up; none of the quests I had gotten would add or could be added to it. It was just a big ol' block. So I constantly have to open my Map just to see where I am going next. I even paid attention to the information the NPCs stated.\n\nI also noticed the majority of the models had yet to be updated to what DOMO was like just before the shut down. So, if anything; this could be called what DOMO was a good year before it actually ended. Also, does anyone else find it odd that the text is some sort of binary but doesn't fit on most of the bars and descriptions; or it is just me?","August 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

The screenshots and trailers are misleading and hype up the game it looked good but when played... It is just such a mess it doesn't even feel finished. As a first pass it is ok but for a final published game it is rubish. I played it for 20 minutes before uninstalling, the character custimization is highly limited and very poorly done. Also the graphics and textures are horrible, without a doubt the worst I have ever seen. The game has very poor control over character movement and  the entire game is very confusing, the starting scene is just so distracting and feels irrelivent to the game. It sets you up for something but then leaves you alone with nothing. Overall a very dissapointing game, there are much better free to play games out there.","February 5","false","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moomooghost/recommended/335820/","moomooghost","[IRWF] MooMooGhost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moomooghost/","42 products in account","This game is very old, I understand that. But really, it was still just was highly disappointing. I do not recommend it to anyone. I wouldn't call it an "acquired taste" even, it's just bad. I only played for about 10 or 15 minutes after creating my character, but I could already tell it was horrible. Here are a few things I learned while in-game.\n\n1.) One of the first things I noticed about the game was its short amount of customization options for character creation. This wasn't a MAJOR issue to me, but I was just slightly disappointed. However, I've played many MMOs before; some have a good, detailed character creation, and some have this simple customization with not many options. So I worked with what I had and it wasn't TOO big a deal, but if you're like me and you like to make your character unique amongst others, I'm letting you know, this game has very few customization options.\n\n2.) The game has little to no direction at all, even for beginners. There is no way to tell who you are supposed to talk to for a quest. There's no exclamation point, question mark, book icon, or anything above the quest NPC's head. You just have to talk to them and kind of go off of a wild guess, or you have to read your journal constantly to figure out where you're supposed to be going. Not your traditional MMO.\n\n3.) Hotkeys. Oh my god, the hotkeys. You couldn't have made them something simple like 'B' for Backpack (or 'I' for Inventory), 'J' for Journal, 'O' for friend list, 'G' for guild interface? Nope. They made it Ctrl+C for inventory, Ctrl+N for options, etc. SO many confusing hotkeys, nothing simple. And guess what? You can't change them. I tried. I sat on the options menu for a good 3 or 4 minutes trying to figure out if there's a way to change the hotkeys, so that maybe I could rebind them to my preference and be able to get over it and get on with playing the game, but no. So basically you just click on the icons in the lower right of the screen (Most people prefer not to do that. It's just easier to use a simple hotkey to get to your inventory!) or learn all the hotkeys which are completely different from the average MMORPG (Which generally use simple hotkeys like the ones I listed before).\n\n4.) Gameplay = boring. MAYBE this would change if i'd given the game more of a shot. Maybe I would go to the next town, learn my class and get skills, etc. but in the beginner town, it was boring. After looking around wondering what exactly to do, talking to a random guy and getting a quest to kill Pupus (basically pigs), I went ahead and did that. The combat was a very "back and forth" style (your character does one hit on the enemy, the enemy hits him/her, your character hits the enemy again, repeat, until the fight is over). Again, maybe the gameplay factor would have changed if I was more into the game and I was able to get skills and such, but I pretty much knew I wouldn't enjoy the game due to the fact that there is basically no sense of direction. You really have to figure it out yourself, who gives quests and such.\n\nIf you're looking for a good anime-style MMORPG to play, go play Mabinogi. I play it from time to time and I love it.","August 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 16 of 42 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","16","42","2","0"

Read the whole thing before you go "well, what do you know, with only one hour?"\n\nUpon starting the game up, it tells you to link your account with their site. That's fine, whatever. The big issue is the fact that the game's resolution is automatically set at a messed up number (couldn't tell you what one, exactly), and you can't change this, until you get in game. In fact, there are no options settings at all at the inital menu, and they are only visible once you get in game.\n\nBesides that point, there is also the fact that the music, for whatever reason, is automatically muted, and you have to turn this on as well. Even after the music is turned on, it's still kinda wonky, and doesn't loop very often, so you'll have a thirty-second period of music, then another few minutes of silence (not counting the attacking sound effects).\n\nCharacter creation is a joke, and I don't know if this was done the way it was AS a joke, or if they weren't finished with it, and never got around to fixing it. You can give your character a large head, and make them taller, shorter, thinner, or fatter. You then have a handful of hairstyles and even less hair colors to pick from. The races seemed interesting, but not too terribly to get me to pick something besides human.\n\nWhile on the subject of characters, the motions are kinda weird. They don't seem broken, but they don't seem too fluid from time to time. The motions themselves are just weird, and it's hard to explain them without seeing them. Basically, they seem a little bit under par for the course, in regards to them.\n\nHumor is kinda bland. The game tries to throw it in, but it's too forced.\n\nNow, some long term player might say "it gets better at level 15/20/30!" and that may be so, but when you're looking at this game, which is still free of course, against something that did the same thing, such as Mabinogi or Dragon Nest, and did it better, why would you waste your time on this?\n\nThe game is rather outdated, that's a given, but there is still a lot about the game that would have been pretty poor, even when it was released.\n\nSo, if you're looking for an anime MMORPG (or any new MMORPG for that matter), I wouldn't look here, unless something shifts in the game's favor.\n","August 14, 2015","false","0.9"," 10 of 30 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","10","30","0","0"

Seriously. It does not support 1920x1080 or any other resolution like this. 4:3 only. Well, maybe it's configurable from outside of the game, but it doesn't allow you to set some proper resolution from the options menu. It also features very low-poly models, low-res textures and font which does not scale. Actually low-poly models are ok, but not the rest. Especially text, which is barely readable on my screen.\n\nSo, I'm not going into the details of the game itself. It might be a great game, but text almost everywhere is unreadable and my eyes hurts just from reading it. I got the starting equipment and decidede to stop.\n\nAh, right, it also features odd hotkeys for the common stuff and camera which have 3 modes neither of which stays behind you when you move using WSAD. Yep, there is an option to use WSAD to move in the menu, but for some reason it is disabled by default.","August 14, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","8","27","0","3"

I'll explain why in a bit.\nI remember spending hours on this game back when it was run by Aeria Games, so I was pretty excited to see its return. It's fairly simple to figure out if you pay attention to any tutorials that you encounter as you progress.\nCharacter customization is very limited if you don't want to spend any money, but there are a lot of costumes, hair dye, etc that you can get either for real money through the item shop or if you manage to save up enough in-game currency to buy from other players.\nOne of this games winning features is the variety in careers you can choose after completing simple qualification quests.  There are 13 careers, each with a unique skill set. At any time, you can switch between careers and level them up individually. You can also add a sub-career which allows you to combine skills from two different professions.\nLike most mmorpg, this game can get a little bit grindy.  Of course, leveling up goes much quicker in a team.  What some players do for resource collection is open a second account. It is possible to have two games running on one computer and switch between them if you download it from the suba games website.  It works best if you set the graphics to full window.  Then you can have one collecting resources while you do quests with the other, and you can trade between them.\nPersonally, this is probably my favorite free mmorpg to play at this point.  It is not too complicated, and it has plenty of variety to keep you occupied for many hours.  I would definitely recommend trying it. Just make sure you give it at least an hour before you decide what you think.","November 23, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have mixed feelings in the review. I am going to say "yes" for the game itself but warn players that there is hardly any support for this game.\n\nI hate to say this... You can tell this game is slowly dying. You can kind've tell. That's not to say there isn't an active playerbase and the community seems friendly. It has great potential if it was taken better care of, though.\n\nThe controls are a bit clunky and the interface/graphics show it's age. The English translation is so-so.\nThe nice feature of this game is that you can switch Professions at any time. You can have a primary and a secondary Profession at any time, mixing skills to create a unique style of gameplay that could match your style.\nYet, it takes hours to collect any crafting items.\nThe flying system only lets you land in certain places, and I just... I had a horrible time with it.\n\nI did like this game and played for a bit, but I can honestly say I have trouble wanting to play a game that has pretty much NO technical support. Good luck trying to contact the company in charge of this game... their forums are dead. But I know I can say I gave this game a fair try.","December 5, 2015","true","41.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, this review is purely bias and I do not condone anybody that hasn't played this game to necessarily try it. The great parts of this game involve community interaction and, yes, roleplaying. This game has a very simple yet complex class system that is utilized well in the later levels, a pet system that is my absolute favorite, and an easier dungeon type setting makes the anime themed world seem real. However, gameplay is very boring compared the newer action MMORPG's and paid items are quite expensive and can be a tad p2w but nonetheless I'm going to be playing this game again to relive my old memories.

SO, this review will be divided into 2 sections. The first part you will read is my SECOND impression of this game where I actually experienced a bit of it. My first impression (which is mainly just me raging about being stuck in a bug) will be at the bottom with it's current rating. So why keep it in instead of just editting it out? Well that's because my rage was REAL. And I want everyone to know that this MMO is old and it has it's own set of problems. I wasn't planning on rewriting this review until one of the big bugs were fixed but since I'm pretty much up to 100 hours, why the hell not. What are you going to get from this review over others? Absolutely nothing because every review on here says the same things, but here goes:\n\nThis game is pretty good. It runs well on low-spec toasters because it's old and the community is literally one of the best group of people I have ever seen on the internet. Which says a lot. Within my first week being on this game I have been invited to a great guild, had people help me with literally everything and people have even given me cosmetics that they paid for with real money. Awesome.\n\n-So this game has 15 classes. 1 starting class with basic harvesting skills and then at lv10 you can start unlocking the rest of the jobs and switching to them whenever you want. Now, I've never really been interested in games where you can just change jobs whenever because it sort of took away what type of character you were. But this game does it right. You level each class and then you can mix and match skill trees together.\nExample: level your doctor a decent amount, switch to a class you haven't leveled yet and carry over the healing spells from doctor. Great.\n\n-I won't really go into the community because I already stated it's perfect except for the Shiithead steam trolls that are Running Amok using le cool kid 4chen terms. (Also the game seems a little dead at night and when you're not in Eversun City. Mainly because this game was washed away in all the steam releases and it's launch on here was coincidentally ruined by the spawn bug.)\n\n-Graphics aged well. Looks decent compared to other recent anime-inspired MMOs. And plenty of rare costume piece to customize your char with. Given you have the time and patience to either grind gold to buy them off players or reach into your wallet and buy CHANCE boxes to try and get some yourself vs. The RNG.\n\n-Gameplay is your typical MMO except for the fact that mobs do not drop gold, they only drop items which can either be sold or kept for collection quests, etc. Closest I can describe it to any other MMO is maybe FlyFF because at lv15 you get a flying quest and I ♥♥♥♥ you not once you start flying, if you've ever played FlyFF, you'll be thinking about that game.\n\n-The GMs are actually active with their community. More than I've seen from a lot of other teams out there.\n\n-Biggest negative in my book is: There are a few bugs. I think the spawn bug is fixed but there's also this inventory bug THAT'S NOT VERY COMMON. I've only seen it happen to 1 of my friends where you get disconnected and lose your equips. But it has never happened to me personally and that was quite awhile back and there's been a few updates since then. If it does happen to you let me know. And also submit a ticket on their site if you lost something valuable.\n\nIdk, best advice I can give is to try it yourself. Download is pretty small.\n\nIf you feel like blocking my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ azz ingame I play my toon: Kairiki\n\nAlright here's my first impression where I was stuck in spawn and got butthurt:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n169 of 268 people (63%) found this review helpful\n1 person found this review funny\n\nDownloaded game, didn't take too long. Tried to play game, oh wait you gotta make an account on their site (not too big of a deal, it's common with MMOs) BUT WAIT! Their site is laggy af and it will probably take you a literal 5 minutes to make an account. ONCE you finally get into the game, the resolutions are complete ♥♥♥♥. Chances are you will get a resolution where you won't be able to click the options button without moving your taskbar or some stupid crap. Mind you, the options menu which is only available ingame is the only way to change resolution which there aren't that many so enjoy a stretched screen. I finally manage to get a decent resolution after literally 30 minutes of fiddling around with it. At last I'm at character select. 35+ Minutes in and I'm at character select. Okay so, I choose the Sprite race because who doesn't want to be a midget, right? I'm plopped inside a fountain of sorts. First thing I notice: a ♥♥♥♥ load of windows covering over half the screen. Also nothing is telling me what to do but it's simple enough, just run to the NPC right? NOPE DEAD MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING WRONG YOU IDIOT! YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THE FOUNTAIN! I spent LITERALLY 30 more minutes trying to figure out just how to get out of spawn, I looked on wikis, I made a discussion post, I messaged GMs. Nothing! I ran around EVERYWHERE IN THAT LITTLE POND! every - ♥♥♥♥ing - where.I clicked all over the damn place, read everything I could find. I literally could not get out of the spawn to try the rest of the game. Of course, I could make a new character with a different race, but I wanted to play the Sprite race. SO ♥♥♥♥ing blow me.\nA HOUR OF MY LIFE WASTED JUST TRYING TO GET OUT OF MY SPAWN and the game looks like ♥♥♥♥ anyways. Any MMO that puts you through this ♥♥♥♥ doesn't deserve to be played. Now, IF some member of the community does get back to me on the discussion I made about how to get out of my spawn maybe I will pick it back up and I MIGHT change my opinion. But until then ♥♥♥♥ YOU! Make a proper tutorial. I'm salty.\n\nEDIT: A veteran player replied to my discussion and told me that the sprite spawn is literally not loading and I have to wait for a patch when according to many wikis the last patch was in February 2015. Yeah no thanks, You should not play an MMO that makes one of the four races unplayable for almost a year, eat ♥♥♥♥.","August 16, 2015","true","204.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","12"

I have mixed feelings in the review. I am going to say "yes" for the game itself but warn players that there is hardly any support for this game.\n\nI hate to say this... You can tell this game is slowly dying. You can kind've tell. That's not to say there isn't an active playerbase and the community seems friendly. It has great potential if it was taken better care of, though.\n\nThe controls are a bit clunky and the interface/graphics show it's age. The English translation is so-so.\nThe nice feature of this game is that you can switch Professions at any time. You can have a primary and a secondary Profession at any time, mixing skills to create a unique style of gameplay that could match your style.\nYet, it takes hours to collect any crafting items.\nThe flying system only lets you land in certain places, and I just... I had a horrible time with it.\n\nI did like this game and played for a bit, but I can honestly say I have trouble wanting to play a game that has pretty much NO technical support.

I'll explain why in a bit.\nI remember spending hours on this game back when it was run by Aeria Games, so I was pretty excited to see its return. It's fairly simple to figure out if you pay attention to any tutorials that you encounter as you progress.\nCharacter customization is very limited if you don't want to spend any money, but there are a lot of costumes, hair dye, etc that you can get either for real money through the item shop or if you manage to save up enough in-game currency to buy from other players.\nOne of this games winning features is the variety in careers you can choose after completing simple qualification quests.  There are 13 careers, each with a unique skill set. At any time, you can switch between careers and level them up individually. You can also add a sub-career which allows you to combine skills from two different professions.\nLike most mmorpg, this game can get a little bit grindy.  Of course, leveling up goes much quicker in a team.  What some players do for resource collection is open a second account. It is possible to have two games running on one computer and switch between them if you download it from the suba games website.  It works best if you set the graphics to full window.  Then you can have one collecting resources while you do quests with the other, and you can trade between them.\nPersonally, this is probably my favorite free mmorpg to play at this point.  It is not too complicated, and it has plenty of variety to keep you occupied for many hours.  I would definitely recommend trying it. Just make sure you give it at least an hour before you decide what you think.","November 23, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like games where you die over and over and over and over and over again, this game might be for you!
