The multiplayer is dead unless you find a dedicated clan or group. But other than that, this is a really amazing sequel (read: amazing sequel) that not only adds to the content, but also to the gameplay, and improves upon the rough edges that the origional Section 8 (which is btw also very amazing) had.\n\nFirst, the content. You will notice quickly that alongside your standard weapons, you have modules that improve certain aspects of your armor suit. Want to be able to absorb large amounts of damage and dish out even more? You can improve the damage per shot that your weapons do, as well as improve your shields an armor to more than double your standard infantryman has. Want to be that classic sniper? You can do that too. You can make a custom loadout for almost any situation. Anti-infantry, anti-armor, anti-turret, and so on. I only wish that you had a way of attacking enemies that are "burning in" so to speak.\n\nThe gameplay is astounding. Section 8 asked the question, "What is players could spawn anywhere on the battlefield?" They answered that question by letting you "burn in" from your dropship onto any point on the battlefield. However, the enemy can deploy stationary AA guns that only serve to shoot you out of the sky (and they do that very well, I can tell you that). You also use this burning in tactically, by striking directly into the enemy base or (I kid you not) right on top of an enemy soldier.\n\nNow, the origional Section 8 had some balancing issues, such as a Machine Gun being more effective than an Assault Rifle at everything except accuracy past 50m. Now, in Prejudice, the Assault Rifle reigns supreme at quick skirmishes between soldiers, while the MG has been altered to a much more supportive and long-lasting state.\n\nSince the maps are fairly large, every soldier has the ability to "overdrive" which lets them run like there's a grizzly on their ♥♥♥. You can use this overdrive ability tactically too, by ramming into enemy soldiers or using the extra speed to make your jetpack that much more effective.\n\nAnother interesting thing Section 8 does is let soldiers call down deployables such as MG guns, RPG launchers, scanners, and more, which allow a group of soldiers to make a small outpost complete with defenses, scanners, AA turrets, and of course depots that repair them all. Trust me, it's not fun to have rockets and bullets raining down on you with no end (until you die).\n\nHaha wow I just realized how much I had rambled on XD\nSo I guess in short,\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, and very underrated. Buy this. Get your friends to buy it. Revive the multiplayer.","June 23, 2014","true","27.8"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","47","49","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/97100/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nSection 8: Prejudice is a Sci-fi First-person shooter developed by TimeGate Studios and released in 2011. Section 8: Prejudice implements different characteristics to break up the monotony of standard First-person shooter competitive multiplayer gameplay.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Section 8: Prejudice takes place after it's predecessor “Section 8” (released: 2009). Alex Corde, (the protagonist) is reviewing basic training and learning how to use the various weapons and tools with the 8th Armored Infantry.\nSuddenly the 8th Armored Infantry is threatened and the United States Empire (Symbolism much?) goes to war again with a group known as the “Arm of Orion”. The basic gist of the rest of the game is: completing various objectives on different planets and trying to track down the leader of the Arm of Orion.\n\nGameplay: Section 8: Prejudice had many unique qualities making it a great game competitive multiplayer First-person shooter, unfortunately there aren't very many people playing it anymore, so multiplier has mostly dried up.\n\nRather then focus on the qualities that Section 8: Prejudice shares with mostly all First-person shooters (usual classes, usual weapons, usual game modes), some different qualities are:\nWhen you spawn, you drop through the atmosphere from drop ships above the map, you can select where to spawn, unless someone has placed an Anti-Air Turret …then you'll probably die from Anti-Air Fire unless you're extremely well armored.\nThe classes are completely customization, with different armor skins, various weapons, stats, and armor boosts. (That is a bit common in this genre, but shhh! it's still worth note.)\nYou can purchase vehicles, turrets, sensors and supply depots by using “Requisition points” that you earn from accomplishing various tasks, challenges, and kills.\nOne final tool to mention, and also my personal favorite the “repair tool”, you can use this tool to repair your armor, your vehicles, your turrets, just about anything with a health bar. You can also set it up so that you siphon health from enemies.\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam achievements for Section 8: Prejudice, however you do unlock Xbox achievements.\n…Yeah logging in gets a bit tricky since you need to download a Microsoft program and create an account if you don't already have an Xbox account.\nThere are 59 achievements with a total of 1250 points, the DLC: Overdrive Map Pack also has 9 achievements. (DON'T BUY ANY DLC, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER)\nThese achievements require a pretty good team of people to accomplish “Win a game on each map in swarm on Hard or Insane difficulty”. About half of these achievements are easily obtainable, a fourth are hard earned, and the last fourth require intense grinding and team work.\n\nPrice: Section 8: Prejudice is priced at $9.99 on it's own, it's a pretty solid title and you can easily spend 10 hours in the game working on the campaign and offline achievements.\nI do not own any of the DLC, but just to warn people ahead of time, the DLC does not work for this game, so don't purchase any DLC.\nReferences:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/97100/discussions/0/828937979268383691/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/97100/discussions/0/558750624694862546/\n\nConclusion: Story: worthy of at least one play through. Gameplay: A nice change of pace from your standard First-person shooter styles. Customization, different game modes, classes, weapons, and repair tool all make Section 8: Prejudice enjoyable. Achievements: none on steam, but you can scratch that itch via Xbox achievements. Price: perfect for the game, however it doesn't hurt to wait for a sale.\nI recommend Section 8: Prejudice to people who enjoy First-person shooters, and Sci-fi themes. Brace yourself for very little multiplayer activity, there are still people who love this game, and you might be able to start or join a group to schedule game days, but all in all you'll probably be playing mostly by yourself.","August 26, 2015","true","38.9"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

The main campaign will probably only run you about 3-4 hours or so, with a decent amount of that time stuck in loading screens.\n\nIt feels like an attempt to replicate the feel of the Halo franchise in a way, by making your characters kind of "floaty", as well as everything having a general "Halo"-like feel to it, from the character design to the weapons.\n\nThe story, however, is rather lackluster, and doesn't really have any memorable moments to it at all. Something about aliens, or a rebel task force... or... Something. Nothing really sticks with you. The cut scenes really don't add any substance to the game at all.\n\nGraphically, the game actually looks really nice. Nothing amazing, but definitely on par with what I would expect from something that's trying very hard to replicate the look and feel of Halo. The environments are polished all the characters look really amazing.\n\nI'd have to say that one of the biggest flaws this game suffers from is that it's using Games for Windows Live, which poses a huge detriment to actually enjoying the game. I made the mistake of forgetting what account I used to register the game with initially, and now I can never fully enjoy the game again, as GFWL does not let you access many features of the game without being logged in, nor does it let you save your Campaign Mode progress. So if you ever forget your GFWL password, you'll never be able to just jump back into the game; you'll have to play it from start to finish in one run.\n\nThe multiplayer is decent, for what it's worth, though I had difficulty finding anybody to actually play with. The actual gameplay in the multiplayer mode was okay. Nothing I'd ever look back on and say "Boy, I want to do that again!", but it wasn't bad, either. Just like the rest of the game, it was just "okay".\n\nI'd say if you want to play a decent sci-fi FPS, it wouldn't hurt to pick up this game. Just don't expect this to be game-changing or anything.","November 25, 2013","true","11.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

Section 8: Prejudice is a sequel to Section 8 and honestly, not much is different. The graphics are a tad better and there is more features, but it still feels like the first game, which is not a bad thing. Both are very pleasant to play and provide a lot to do. Prejudice has a 5 hour single-player, which is pretty average now-a-days, but it's multiplayer provides many more hours of boisterous gameplay.  You can make 7 classes for plenty styles of play, all matches last a long time, not just TDM or CTF and you can call in a lot of support items such as hover bikes, mech suits, and artillery. GFWL could provide some issues, but so far it has not been a problem for me. Overall Section 8: Prejudice is fun. Sort of generic, but that's not entirely a bad thing.

You can no longer play this game online. The single player campaign is decent, but nothing revolutionary that hasn't been done before in a sci-fi shooter. The fact that this is still being sold as a four-pack on Steam is truly a disappointment and a scam. The price of this game is also way to high for a game that is no longer supported. If you are buying this after 2013, do yourself a favor and don't. My friend was never able to log into windows live to register his game, but at least I was able to get in and play the campaign mode. Since I was actually able to successfully get this game onto my computer, I have enjoyed playing the campaign mode, but had I bought this game for myself, I would have been frustrated by the fact that a game with an emphasis on multiplayer is still being sold when said multiplayer no longer exists.","January 8, 2014","false","2.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

But sadly, if you try to obtain DLC, you cannot ever access what you've purchased. So BUYER BEWARE: do NOT try and purchase any DLC's. Microsoft apparently killed all that, and even though Steam displays this content, it will not actually ever be available.\n\nThere are four basic maps with the original game, and it's a kick. It's lots of fun (for awhile, anyway), to just chase enemies and try and beat them at whatever mode you're using. I've played dozens and dozens of hours on this and the original Section 8.\n\nBut part of me wants to give this not only a big thumbs down but also a big middle finger - for the jip that happens when you buy the DLC. Thanks to whatever happened at Microsoft, you won't ever get to access that new content. And even though Steam is hawking it, they won't address your complaints or give your money back for this issue.\n\nAt this point i'm not even sure the original would work if purchased.

The A.I works well enough, but the story is dreadful and a lot of what makes the gameplay enjoyable in multiplayer is missing in the single player mode.\n\nThen there's multiplayer which is one of the best I've played for a while. The game is sadly almost dead, so you'll have to schedule events to be able to get a group together to play some horde mode or their battlefield like conquest mode with shooting that feels very similar to Halo. Nothing wrong with that as long as it's done well. You can play with bots, which works and is fun, but you can't get the full section 8 experience anymore and with GFWL shutting down in a few months, I'm not sure what will happen to Section 8. I have to say though, for anyone who liked Halo's multiplayer mode, you will probably like this, perhaps even more depending on what kind of game modes you prefer.\n\nIf you want to have some fun with it before it goes completely dead and you're not afraid to spend the small amount of 15 bucks for something you'll only have for a few months(see it as a cheap console game rental), then I strongly recommend this.","October 10, 2013","true","60.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/recommended/97100/","TacticalTruth","TacticalTruth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacticalTruth/","184 products in account","Section 8: Prejudice - Unfortunately dead\n\nIf you’ve never heard of the Section 8 franchise I wouldn’t be shocked. It was a bit of a sleeper on the Xbox and PS3 back in 2009. And had a sequel, Section 8: Prejudice, in 2011. But it never really made a name for itself.\n\nSection 8 is a first person shooter that is, genuinely, pretty fun and does a very respectable job of offering an engaging experience. But sadly it never really seemed to catch on with people as a multiplayer game. Currently on the Steam forums there are about twenty-five people that actively want to play the game with each other. It also doesn’t help that the PC version is hamstrung by Games For Windows Live. Which, is essentially the black plague of video games. Very few were good enough to survive it’s life sucking parasitism.\n\nThat being said, Section 8: Prejudice has a fully fledged offline component with a single player campaign and decent bots. So If you were to buy this game right now there would still be content for you to enjoy. Which is nice!\n\nSadly I found the single player campaign to be pretty dull and it didn’t grab me at all. But, to be honest I didn’t buy this game for the single player and really had no interest in it. So take that for what it’s worth.\n\nThe real thing that attracted me to this game was that it appeared to be a cross between Battlefield, Halo, and Warhammer 40k. And guess what… That’s almost exactly what it is! The main game mode I play is called conquest. Which places you in a big sandbox map with various objectives on the map for you to fight over. This will require you to run from one side to the other many times over. But with up to thirty two players at a time, it’s usually pretty lively at all times.\n\nI love me a battlefield game. And they don’t even have to be named Battlefield either. I loved Big Team Battle in Halo 2, Battlefield 2142, Power Struggle in Crysis, Red Orchestra 2, Quake Wars, etc. I have a soft spot for big ♥♥♥ multiplayer war sand boxes. There’s just something to them that I love.\n\nChaos, it’s probably all the chaos.\n\nNow, what differentiates Section 8 from all of the other games that I mentioned? Well… That’s probably the game’s biggest weakness. Because there isn’t really that much too make it stand out. It’s a little bit generic. It doesn’t have a particularly strong flavor to it. It’s a Sci-Fi battlefield game where in you shoot dudes, drive tanks, pilot mechs, and drop in from orbit… That’s it.\n\nNow, this isn’t a bad thing at all. Section 8 does what it does well. It just doesn’t do it better than anyone else. And I think that might be why the player base dried up. Which is unfortunate.\n\nI have a game night with my friends every week where we play multiplayer games. And I brought Section 8 up because it’s cheap and something we could all play. My friend asked me what made Section 8 worth playing. All I said to him was “Nothing in particular, it’s just fun.”\n\nHonestly, and sadly, I think that describes this game really well. It’s not particularly special. But it’s just fun. And there’s nothing wrong with that.\n\nNow, if you’re still interested let me tell you more about the general flow of the game.\nYou move pretty slow, and are relatively fragile in Section 8. Which is an interesting combination. There are many occasions where once I start getting shot by the time I can react, break the enemy’s shield and start damaging their health… I’m already dead. This requires you to be diligent. And you really have to use the environment to your advantage.\n\nThankfully there is a sprint that allows you to cover ground faster, but is relatively slow. In order to really get somewhere you have to run for a short period of time before you really start to go ham. But this also makes you put your weapon away meaning if you’re caught sprinting it could go bad for you.\n\nAll of this to say, I find the movement to be a little too sluggish for my taste. But it does make the game a bit more interesting. Most of the maps are rather large, and usually have about four points to capture. So you really have to commit to where you’re going. By the time you get there, the enemy might have started taking another point-- or even killed all of your allies. This is partly circumvented by the fact that you can literally pick your spawn point anywhere on the map. The game has your ‘reinforcements’ in orbit aboard a massive battlebarge dropping troops from orbit. This makes things really interesting, because no point is safe. And there is almost always constant pressure from all sides! I would say this is definitely Section 8’s defining characteristic.\n\nThere are also a decent variety of weapons in the game. You have the standards, Assault rifle, Sniper, Rocket Launcher, and shotgun present. As well as a more powerful ‘Machine Gun’, as well as a ‘Pulse Cannon’-- Which is kinda like a grenade launcher.\n\nNone of the weapons feel as powerful as I would have liked, but they’re all usable and effective. One cool aspect of the loadouts is that you can choose various ammo types for certain guns. The shotgun for instance can fire slugs, or incendiary ammo. And that’s pretty dope.\n\nAs I said, Section 8 has a decent amount of content to offer. But it doesn’t do anything better than anyone else. It’s a fun game to play here and there. But I can’t imagine really devoting a large amount of time to it.\n\nMaybe if it had a larger player base, or didn’t suffer from Games For Windows Live-itus.\nIf you really want to play a battlefield-like, and want a game that’s similar to BF2142 Section 8 might fill that role.\n\nBut I doubt you’ll be able to really play it with anyone other than the AI. Although the game is only $10 I don’t feel that it’s a worthwhile time sink unless you have friends. And for that reason I would say give it a pass.\n\nIf you liked this review, check out more at 100HourSave.com","April 5","false","7.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

First is actually trying to get to the game. Prepare for 15 seconds of unskippable logos, followed by having to use Games for Windows Live, followed by having to insert the CD key, followed by various "press any key to continue" menus. it reeks of a sloppy console port.\n\nSecond, the actual game itself had lots of potential that it wasted. The idea is that it's an objective-based gameplay where objectives spawn randomly. "Team A guard this caravan from point A to B and get a ton of points if it makes it. team B, blow it up and get a good amount of points." or "A bunch of meteors just fell in this area. Whichever team collects more than half of them first gets bonus points." Sounds like something that would foster a lot of teamwork and cooperation... EXCEPT... you'll get the most points, unlocks and rewards from just sniping from the hills at all the fools who actually go for the objectives. It reminds me of Call of Duty in a domination map where literally nobody else is going for the flags.","March 10, 2014","false","6.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's like Battlefield in superpowered exo-suits. However I don't think you will find anyone playing it. It was always a sad story with Prejudice. Devs took complaints to heart from the first Section 8, made a great game and priced it well, and then it didn't sell well at all. Such a shame for such a good game. It has great coop too...\n\nAlso there is no spawn timer because you spawn in orbit and crash down without a parachute to any point the map. And if you land on someone you instantly kill them. If you ever wanted to feel like Iron Man, this is the game to do it. WHY did it not sell well? WHY? It's so good :(\n\nThis is why we can't have nice things.

Don't buy this game. GFWL shutting down ruined this game. it turned this game into a useless husk.\n\nI knew this game had it's online servers shut down going into it, and  I just wanted to play the offline multiplayer. What I didn't know was that you cant even create an offline account ala Battlefield 2 without a GFWL account.\n\nYOU CAN NOT SAVE YOUR GAME IN ANY WAY.  So the few unlocks you can get in the offline will not remain, and the campaign is just not an option for obvious reasons. This game needs to either have standalone steam support via cutting out GFWL In it's entirety (timegate studios went bankrupt, so an update is probably never gonna happen) or this game needs to be removed from steam so no more people are tricked into wasteing thier money for a great game that dosent ♥♥♥♥ing work.\n\nAnd it is a great game. think Halo + Tribes + planetside. its a damn fun game, but the fact that the game is a useless husk because of a ♥♥♥♥ service that dosen't ♥♥♥♥ing do anything anymore, makes this game unfortunately not worth a dime.

The single player campaign is little more than a tutorial for the fight to come against other players.  The respawn system is one-of-a-kind and, quite frankly, never gets old.  There is a leveling system in this game, so newbies be prepared to get stomped a few times if you don't like to work as a team.  The stat customization is simple and easily understood, which prevent new players from becoming confused, but detailed enough to provide hardcore players with the opportunity to geek-out with a calculator over single-stat point decisions.  The only downside to the multiplayer is the lack of a player base.  Expect to see the same faces over and over and choose from only a hand full of servers, even at peak time.  Hopefully there will be another Section 8 that steers clear from Windows Live so that this wonderful gem may thrive.","February 12, 2012","true","190.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Section 8: Prejudice is basically a low budget, science fiction Battlefield, with a few neat touches of its own to boot. An important part of the game, it that trully makes you feel you are a futuristic super-soldier, with the ability to sprint blindingly fast, jetpack into the air, and use a limited lock-on ability with your weapons, all right from the get go.\n\nThe primary goal of each map is to capture points around the map, much like Battlefield, but interestingly, small side-missions pop up while the larger battle is going on, which can net your team additional points. This keeps the battle dynamic and a little unpredictable, keeping a handful of capture points from being the sole focus of all combatants.\n\nI also really enjoyed that vehicles and other supplies need to purchased and dropped in from space, rather than just respawning after a period of time. The same is true when you die; you are given the option of being dropped from orbit, allowing you to land behind enemy lines, provided they haven't set up anti-air auto-cannons to destroy you in mid-air.\n\nS8 also includes a fun four-player co-op mode, similiar to a horde defense mode from other shooters. While the single player is pretty boring and repetitive, and not worth the time, the different multiplayer modes are all great. It's unfortunate this game didn't do very well, despite its bargain bin price. It's unlikely there's much of an active community left, as it was on the smaller side even on release in 2011, but if you have three friends, I recommend picking up the four-pack for the co-op at the very least. It's one of the best budget shooters out there, and some of its innovations outdo the bells and whistles of the FPS heavy hitters out there.","August 19, 2013","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll address a few of them here. What Section 8 Prejudice lacks the greatest would be it's story. If a bee is a cliche there's a hive of them in the story line. I did notice some lag issues while playing it but at it's worst it's nothing more than a hiccup. Also another key factor is the requirement for a windows live account which to me seems stupid since I bought it through Steam. On the flipside the gameplay is polished nicely specifically gunplay. All weapons are balanced to an extent although some take favor over others such as the assault rifle. The strongest aspect of this game would be multiplayer as the matches are rarely dull. While a lack of modes is sad the ones that are there have great replay value. Conquest mode is particularly liberating as the amount of stuff to do on the default level is fanastic. Traditional team deathmatch paired with holding key places thrughout the map alone has players moving their feet the entire match. What really gets me are the Dynamic Conquest Missions or DCMs that will randomly start to provide a set chalenge to fullfill. The variety is just enough to be prepared to deal with them yet no so much that there isn't hundreds of them in the game to be prepared about. This provides a spice that makes replay value great. The progression system is also rewarding as all weapons are available at the start but several upgrades can be thrown in. That sniper rifle not doing enough damage against infantry? Just set the ammo type to incendary rounds. Going against long range targets? Have an RPG paired with a mortar attachment makes all run in fear. The AI itself is a masterpiece as playing against it on a medium setting makes it feel like playing with other humans. It's incredibly smart in knowing what weapons work against certain targets. It also knows how to be a troll so there can be a very frustrating time but also rewarding in the sense that when you drop into the match again you know they have say a rifle. Well what god is that going to do against the mech you just summoned? Not much.\n\nOverall this game is underappreciated and deserves a lot more love than it gets. I'd highly reccomend this game if you want a shooter that has a great multiplayer system but somewhat fails in the singleplayer department. I give this game a 8.5/10.","June 12, 2013","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I'll address a few of them here. What Section 8 Prejudice lacks the greatest would be it's story. If a bee is a cliche there's a hive of them in the story line. I did notice some lag issues while playing it but at it's worst it's nothing more than a hiccup. Also another key factor is the requirement for a windows live account which to me seems stupid since I bought it through Steam. On the flipside the gameplay is polished nicely specifically gunplay. All weapons are balanced to an extent although some take favor over others such as the assault rifle. The strongest aspect of this game would be multiplayer as the matches are rarely dull. While a lack of modes is sad the ones that are there have great replay value. Conquest mode is particularly liberating as the amount of stuff to do on the default level is fanastic. Traditional team deathmatch paired with holding key places thrughout the map alone has players moving their feet the entire match. What really gets me are the Dynamic Conquest Missions or DCMs that will randomly start to provide a set chalenge to fullfill. The variety is just enough to be prepared to deal with them yet no so much that there isn't hundreds of them in the game to be prepared about. This provides a spice that makes replay value great. The progression system is also rewarding as all weapons are available at the start but several upgrades can be thrown in. That sniper rifle not doing enough damage against infantry? Just set the ammo type to incendary rounds. Going against long range targets? Have an RPG paired with a mortar attachment makes all run in fear. The AI itself is a masterpiece as playing against it on a medium setting makes it feel like playing with other humans. It's incredibly smart in knowing what weapons work against certain targets. It also knows how to be a troll so there can be a very frustrating time but also rewarding in the sense that when you drop into the match again you know they have say a rifle. Well what god is that going to do against the mech you just summoned? Not much.\n\nOverall this game is underappreciated and deserves a lot more love than it gets. I'd highly reccomend this game if you want a shooter that has a great multiplayer system but somewhat fails in the singleplayer department. I give this game a 8.5/10.","June 12, 2013","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

In addition, the weapons have a nice feel to them, the armor really feels like powered armor, and the orbital drops are just really cool. The ability to change your loadouts not just based on weapons, but on ammo and supporting tools is nice also.

Like, badly. I thought that the concept of ariel drop soldiers with high tech equipment was awesome, but unfortunately that is all it has to offer as far as being inventive. There isn't that much that makes it stand out from any other shooter. I mean, yes, you get some cool equipment, like a mortar, and yes, you do get to call in heavy vehicles to help out your team, but the thing is, that is deminished by the poor design of the AI, and the bordom that sets in when you play round after round with it feeling the same each time.\n\nYou play as a soldier that is part of a Squad known as Section 8. After your base is attacked, you set out with an army to fight the threat of invasion.\n\nThat is the story. The acting and character deveopment was so rushed, I found it hard to really care about anything that was happening in the story. Coupled with the poor AI, I felt like I was playing a space-aged CoD campain.\n\nThe weapons are stock and standard. You have an assault rifle, a sniper rifle, a heavy machine gun, a shotgun, and a couple other standard weapons. They do not feel as powerful as they are ment to be. Killing an enemy with any of these means taking out their shields, then you need to take down their health. With a regular gun, this will take about 2.5 magazines. It feels monotonous, and tedious. Often times, I would find myself quitting the game to play some other shooter.\n\nIf you are thinking about buying this game, wait until it is on sale. It isn't worth the amount when it isn't on sale. If more thought and time went into this product, I feel as if it would have changed the way shooters were made, but unfortunately, it feels like a poorly done Chinese brand Halo.","December 26, 2013","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story, while simple, is solid and alot of fun. 5-6hrs for the campain is good for a $15 title, and this is BEFORE the other content. Graphics are incredible (of course, this is expected of a Unreal Engine game) and the art style impressive. There is a full multiplayer game here featuring 3 modes and dedicated servers. But wait, theres more! Character customisation comes in 4 different armor suits, and different shoulder pads as you level. In addition, you get the deepest class customisation I've ever seen in a game, this goes beyond 3 perks equipment and weapons. It has a perk system reminisant to a RPG and it WORKS. Equipment is pretty well balanced. it also sports THE most original way of spawning, dropping in from orbit (woot).\n\nFor $15 and a $4 map pack, this game is CHEAP.

Section 8's biggest downside is the fact that it uses Games for Windows Live - which is a slow, cumbersome interface that has no place on PC gaming platforms.","November 6, 2011","true","126.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The AI is very good as it uses all the game functions that I know of. There's a lot of depth to this game. For example the protect VIP mission. If you manage to protect him then the VIP stays right by the control point that he ends up at and protects it for you, so there is a reward for completing the mission (and a point!). There are many other missions and various vehicles and weapons. All have their stenghts and weaknesses and various function sto discover. The art and animations are very good. For example the mech walker melee attack. I just had my mech attack an enemy on a bike. He actually picked him up and ripped him off the bike. The animation was amazing as the enemy guy is destroyed and as his bike explodes ! Only gripe I have is that there needs to be another single player mission released.

HOWEVER, the company that made it (Timegate) went bankrupt a few years ago, due to another company (SouthPeak) suing them over the rights to the Section 8 IP (and amoung other things). I won't go over any details, but Southpeak definately did not sue because they liked the IP. If they did, they would've taken over development and support of this game. However, they have not, and haven't shown ANY signs of ever using the IP again.\n\nThus, the ranked multiplayer servers are all gone. There are quite a few pretty significant unlocks that are now impossible to obtain.\n\nAnother issue is that the game requires Games For Windows Live. Yes, that horrid thing that Microsoft did away with. However, since this game is not getting any support anymore, it has not been updated to not require GFWL.\n\nThere is also a major lack of people playing this game online, mainly due to the above issues. You will be hard-pressed to find an unranked game available. (And then, if you're new to the game, you'll be woefully undergeared compared to the few vets who still play. And since ranked servers are gone, you'll have no way to catch up.)\n\nBelieve me, if this game was still being supported, I would recommend it in a heartbeat. However, since it's not, I have to say you should stay away from this game. Buying it just gives more money to Southgate, and that's NOT a good thing... Plus, you'll not get anywhere near the full value out of the game now.","January 9, 2015","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's been a long while since I've fired this game up so my memory a little spotty given all the other games I've played and the best part of this game is the power armor suit. It makes you feel alot like superman with the crazy jumping and dashing you can do but with that crazy jumping and moving it's hard to keep an eye and relocate enemies. Don't worry though, they have no problem as they shoot with sharp shooter skills. Is this game fun? Yea... very likely... most people will probably like it. I just don't. Can I recommend this game?

I hadn't touched it much because I wasn't able to figure out how to get GFWL... until recently. GFWL does work and the community does a great job of explaining how to get everything up and running. Yes, there aren't many people online, BUT you can play online (thanks to all the help from the community members) even if there aren't too many games to come by. The more important thing to me was the offline modes with bots which are ALL possible. Not to mention you can increase bot numbers in game. So if you were on the fence because of negative reviews saying GFWL is down, just check out the guides and discussions.\n\nAs for the game itself, here is why I love it:\n\nDynamic combat missions make every game feel unique and it's a feature I really wish was in other games. It makes the already solid Control Point centered gameplay even more fun and complex by adding a game mode within a game mode. They are all similar to game modes found in other games like escort missions, king of the hill, etc. and there are multiple objectives like that every game that you can choose to accomplish or not.\n\nYou acquire in game money during rounds that are used to purchase supply drops that can include turrets, tanks, mech suits (like a smaller scale version of Titanfall's mechs), and more. With these items, you can make the game more like a tower defense simulator or go on the offensive with a variety of vehicles. It really fits a lot of play styles and let's you do whatever you want.\n\nThe spawn system is awesome with players dropping into matches like sci-fi skydivers. You can pick anywhere on the map to spawn... unless there is an enemy anti-air turret (an item you can call in or that exist around enemy bases). It's incredibly fun and you can even kill players you land on.\n\nYou also have a lot of choices with character builds with weapons and perks.\n\nHorde mode.\n\nFor a really in-depth look, check out TotalBiscuits videos on the game. He covers everything very well (if you want to sit through it all).\n\nIt's a shame this is the last game of the series and that it isn't active. I would pay more than $60 for a new game like this with all of the custimization options and offline play capabilities for when games eventually fade out (like this did). I'm so grateful for the community for helping bring back one of my favorite games of all time!\n\n","May 10","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
