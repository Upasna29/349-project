The player collects cards to build a deck of spells and creatures.  When you approach enemies on the world map you have the opportunity to fight them.  This is where the actual card game starts.  The player takes turn with the enemy casting spells and attacking.  Victory is achieved by killing the opponent.  The card game is surprisingly complex and it feels rewarding when your deck works.  In addition your character levels up and can choose perks that will influence your strategy.  If you enjoy these types of table top games you will probably have fun with Etherlords 2.\n\nThe problem is...everything else outside the card game. The voice acting is sub par and the movement/animations on the world map are jerky and frustrating.  There is no camera angle that let's you properly see where you're going and there are no resolution options that I could fine.\n\nI rushed thought the poor dialog and map navigation as fast as possible so I could get back to actually playing the card game.    If you like card games then I will grudgingly recommend Etherlords 2 because it can be quite fun, but everything else almost spoils the game.","February 14, 2014","true","2.5"," 125 of 136 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","125","136","0","5"

There were so many unique monsters in it. Where as so many games apply NO creativity at all and just throw in generic monsters, Like spiders, skeletons, werewolves, zombies, orcs, elves and demons, this game steps away from that. It makes its own unique races, creatures and characters. Also it avoids the classic elements of fire vs water earth vs air and so on. It has good enviroments and music. The game may not have the most current graphics but there is a charm to older figure style games. the mechanics are very intricate too. they arnt built around this race beats this one, or these spells beat this, its all about strategy. One build could get wrecked by a lower level wild monster, but trumph a boss. It even has a button that makes it so the game plays for you so you can take a look at its sweet beastiary and magic. I wish there were more games out there like this. A good game isnt something that blows your mind with its rendering or models, its one that keeps you entertained and interested.","November 10, 2015","true","41.7"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","39","40","0","0"

Despite its age, it holds up remarkably well thanks to solid gameplay mechanics, and the graphics come from an era of 3D where their aging looks don't count against the game at all. The story and voice acting are fun, with the game giving you access to a bunch of different tactics and gimmicks you can play in your decks. All kinds of synergies and cool strategies for you to discover and come up with. The game is constantly challenging you as well, setting you up against very specifically designed decks, leaving you to figure out how to make decks of your own that counter them. I can easily recommend this game to any fan of card games.","October 18, 2014","true","9.0"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

Is it that it's kind of a ripoff of Magic The Gathering? Well, Blizzard were not the first ones to rip those damn cards. Etherlords did it first, and I personally think this game still holds up to Heartstone, if what you're looking is a singleplayer experience. As usual I'll start talking about the things the game doesn't do right:\n\nThe game has a story on it, a story that seems somewhat deep for a card-based game... However, it never got hooked to it. Seriously, it's quite boring. It also doesn't help the story that most characters have less than average voice-acting to them.\n\nAnother issue I have with it is the difficulty. Most of the enemies in the game are okay, offer a good challenge, and being defeated usually means that you should look at your deck and change your cards, as there's probably a better way to deal with this sh#t. However, one of the races on the game seems to have some balance issues: the Pale race. These guys don't f#ck arround. Some of their monsters are hilariously broken, as they're insultingly hard to kill (they usually just go hollow when you kill them, becoming a ghost but being able to return to life in exchange of mana or other stuff), and some of them deal insane amounts of damage, while also draining your HP. Seriously, build yourself the most broken and lame deck against those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nThe last thing is that the multiplayer is long dead. Now there are ways to play with people, even while the servers died years ago by using third-party software... But there's barely anyone who has the game. I HAD IT YEARS AGO WHEN IT RELEASED AND EVEN THEN IT WAS HARD TO PLAY WITH SOMEONE! This game did not get any attention during it's life-time, and it shows.\n\nHowever, is the game good? Holy crap, it is.\n\nThe gameplay is a real good challenge, an entertaining strategy game were you're always trying to build your deck to get better, but also a game were defeat is usually just the perfect chance to get better. Something like that is hard to pull off.\n\nThe amount of different cards, races and monsters is also quite great. There are tons of different strategies you can build to yourself, along with the tons of different enchantments, traps, artifacts and other crap you can get your hands on.\n\nThe level system is also interesting, and I liked it a lot. As you level up, you can select extra passive skills such as regenerating some HP each X turns, getting an extra card each X turns and so on. They really make you feel like your deck and character is unique.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yeah, IF you're a fan of this kind of strategy games. If you like Magic The Gathering, Yu-gi-oh, Heartstone and all of those other weird card based games, you'll like it a lot. If you're not a fan of those but you like strategy games, it might also interest you. If you're neither of those, you should turn arround.\n\nOh, and ♥♥♥♥ Exile. I f#cking hate that spell. It can go f#ck a d#ck sideways on the shadow realm.\n\nTL:DR Edition: Old card based game that ripped off Magic The Gathering, mostly singleplayer because of dead multiplayer. If you like Heartstone and other card games, give it a try on a sale.","March 23","true","13.4"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","0"

Gameplay is similar to regular card games so you should be familiar with the concept . Campaign has overtop map like Heroes of Might and Magic only instead of fighting on a grid it turns into card game during combat .\n\nThis game is pretty old and does not support high resolution . Poor texture is a bit annoying but overall design and artstyle made it age like a fine cheese .\n\nSurprisingly Etherlords2 has more depth than most modern games . Aside from basic spells and creatures you also can level up your hero to gain uniqe abilities and use several different artifacts. There is also some resource management as you will have to buy/sell cards in shops and look for resources around the map .\n\nThe best way to play this game is HotSeat PVP or over 2 computers with a friend but single player campaign is enjoyable too . You can probably use 3d party software to find oldschool players but at that point it's not worth the hussle for me .\n\nThe campaign plays similar to Heroes of might and Magic but with less features . Some fights can take you 50+ tries even with the right deck . Its very fun to build specific decks to kill overpowered opponents which is kinda similar to Hearthstone Boss fights .\n\nIf you are a big cardgame fanatic you own to yourself to cheak the PvP mode or you can even enjoy playing story mode by yourself.\n\nConsidering the age of this game I would give it 8/10 . Etherlords 2 is a bit wird because they tried to make the game different from HOMM while keeping some of the features that were not necessary . As a result the campaign mode feels like a bad copycat of Heroes of M&M + cardgame .\n\nSelling Etherlord2 for $1 is insulting because it should be considered PC classic . If you like card games you should try it and maybe you will have many hours of fun .","December 26, 2014","true","11.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

The graphics and engine appeared about the same. Combat still plays similar to Magic the Gathering, and you still have a hero that travels the world map. However, you no longer have a base to defend and you have only one hero instead of multiple. There are no more 'turns' on the map view so your hero just moves along at your own pace to gather resources; the game still tracks 'days' by your movement to determine resource collections and world effects. The camera is also locked onto your hero now so you can't survey the map as you could in the first game, which can be a pain.\n\nAlso you only now have 3 resource types instead of the 8 or so in the previous game which makes tracking them simpler; resources are still collected, and are still used to purchase new spells. A major difference in this game, and one I liked, was that you can keep a selection of spells in reserve apart from your 'spellbook' for battle, so you can swap spells out between battles. You also no longer have to worry about running entirely out of good spells, as your spell supply is replenished automatically after every battle. However, now all spells - even basic ones - have limits as to how many you can cast in a  battle. This balances out the auto resupply, and I found it a welcome change. Heroes still gain XP from battles to increase HP and learn skills similar to the first game. Many of the spells and skills are the same, though there are some new ones too.\n\nTooltips can now be set to appear just by hovering, but the delay means that usually you will still be spending a lot of time right-clicking to be able to instantly view the info about everything. The tutorials have been drastically improved (and because of this I might recommend to actually play this one first). The voice acting has improved from some of the worst in the first game to fairly decent in this game, which is good because now there are voices for characters as you travel around the map in game and not just for the objectives screen. Really the only thing I didn't like much or found frustrating was the obnoxious camera for the world map; it was nothing spectacular in the first game but now it is a major pain being locked on to your character (making the minimap almost entirely useless), often spinning around when you don't want it to, and zoomed in quite far.\n\nFortunately the combat is about the same as in the first game which is to say very fun and the main focus of the game, improved further by your ability to exert greater control over your spellbook and more immediate access to new spells that can be swapped in instantly rather than having to charge them at a portal like in the first game. Overall, I recommend to fans of the first game or of CCG / MTG-like games or RPGs.","March 8, 2014","true","12.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalnaur/recommended/270790/","Kalnaur","Kalnaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kalnaur/","490 products in account","Etherlords II feels like a game lost in what it's predecessor could have been, and what it wants to be.  It strives to give the same sense of battle as the previous game: turn based card battles in the same vein as Magic the Gathering.  However, it has taken all jeopardy out of those battles.  Normally, for me this would not be a bad thing, and indeed it is helpful, in that the game is formated much more like and RPG, like a story.  So each battle gives much needed XP and strategy information for further battles, and if one tactic doesn't work, another might.\n\nThis would all work wonderfully, but for the fact that the story you gain is so scant, and the game primarily turns into a map crawl where you guess and pick and choose at which creatures are the best to pick this time.  If the game made the battles interesting, it would be one thing, but as a person who finds chess ultimately dull, this game made me horribly bored.  Plus there was no risk; you could just "try again" at any battle, having lost nothing, so the game turns into an exercise not really in strategy per se, so much as a guessing and recording game for each of the story lines, where you figure out what is effective through tedious trial and error, then reenact it on any higher level monster of the same type with the same types of creatures.\n\nThe lack of investment this wrought, for me made the story boring, the battles tedious and the tactics canned.  With the sound and the graphics obviously salvaged from it's predecessor, this is barely two steps up the ladder from the first game, which was in all honesty more difficult and with a higher risk, but also much too punishing.  This sequel makes the opposite mistake, where there are no stakes, no worry, and the only thing this serves to do is waste the player's time trying to determine the best way to play, or to engender cheating using anything from guides to actual codes in an attempt to grasp the story.\n\nI cannot in good faith recommend this game.","June 10, 2014","false","7.1"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","28","52","0","0"

The interface sorely needs an update i.e. I can't even scroll the window as the camera view is locked to the hero's position. Also, the various abilities could be better explained such as what Regenaration (1) means. If this game is remade with a better interface and achievements, I will definitely recommend it! But not as it is now though... reminds me of the old Shandalar game, this is that good!","January 7, 2015","false","1.3"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XavierCrow/recommended/270790/","XavierCrow","FissionChip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XavierCrow/","213 products in account","Etherlords is Magic The Gathering meets Heroes of Might & Magic. There is a lot to enjoy here and it's one of my all time favourites, something I just keep coming back to over the years, each time getting a little bit further. When I saw it was on Steam I couldn't resist picking it up. I recommend playing it on Easy as some of the battles are extremely tough even then, and playing as Vitalis first as it seems to be the easier campaign.\n\nWhile the English voice acting could be better, the in-battle voices are all in fantasy languages which sound great! some of the animations can take a little too long and the AI can make some weird decisions, but these don't take away from what is a very relaxing and enjoyable game, with a nice, if sometimes erratic, difficulty curve. Great music, sound and creature designs (seriously, what happened to good creature designs like this?) come together to create a rather under-appreciated experience.\n\nHighly recommended for the MTG or other card game enthusiasts out there.","September 11, 2015","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
