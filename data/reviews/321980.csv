Its like playing a dream works or pixar movie. This game has some MAJOR story telling potential. I get a Zelda vibe from it mixed with Fable, only 100% open world, destructible environments and its own unique style. I purposely play for a bit, stop for a week, then come back and check out the amazing things that have been added. If you like supporting indie companies and want a fun alpha in return, then this is your game.

The first thing that'll grab a lot of people's attention would probably be it's aesthetics. It's design being inspired by claymation the world and it's characters does have a pretty cartoony "doughiness" to it. At times the game feels almost like playing an interactive Pixar Movie.\n\nHardland as an ARPG is pretty simple overall. Go around a vast world, where the town areas are hand designed while the dungeons and wilderness are randomly generated. Kill some mobs, level up, find loot, explore, and maybe pick up a side quest or 2 along the way. There's no main quest that I've found so the game is very open to however the player decides to play it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHXJ7h9ytMw\nHardland does a lot of stuff right. The graphics are impressive, it's well optimized and stable, it features an open sandbox for the player to explore with RNG elements keeping things fresh. These are all enjoyable factors of the game, but Hardland also does a lot of stuff wrong as well. With out a main quest and the side quest being mostly of the fetch variety, the game lacks a sense of direction. At first most players will be wandering around wondering what they're supposed to be doing before realizing, wandering around is what they're supposed to be doing. The game also lacks interest points. It's great that Hardland gives the player a vast and open world to explore, but I haven't found much interesting things to find. Sure there are some chests, and some side quest (again mostly fetch quests) laying around, but nothing that truly grabbed my attention. In such a vast and gorgeous looking world, it's a shame that I have to report on it's at times, empty feeling. The game also features fairly primitive mechanics. The leveling up system is basic, the equipment system is basic, even the combat feels basic. The game also suffers from a few quality of life issues. There is only 1 save slot, and all the items you collect are ordered by alphabetical. There is no equipment tab, food tab, or any sense of organization at all.\n\nSo I've mentioned a laundry list of things I took issues with, but I'm still feeling pretty positive about Hardland. I think the game has a ton of potential, and hope to see the game grow and add content as it continues forward. I think if the devs can overhaul the combat, and fill the world with more interesting discoveries, it's open world idea could very well be something special. It already has a gorgeous art design as a strong foundation, it just needs to be built upon at this point.\n\nOverall Hardland is an ARPG that is bursting at the seams with potential. That potential just needs to be realized.\n\nPros:\n- Impressive visuals\n- Vast and gorgeous world to explore\n- Open world sandbox approach\n\nCons:\n- Lacks a sense of direction\n- Lacks interest points\n- Mechanics are very primitive","August 26, 2015","true","3.8"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

I explored all maps which cost about 3 hours and there were no storyline and not many missions. What is worse, I lost my savedata after every upgrade. Basically, the most attractive thing for me was graphics. However, as I mentioned, this game developers works so hard that they upgrades this game frequently and everytime develop a lot. I have only played around 1 hour for recent versions, it surprised me a lot. It has few more maps(seems around 1-2 hours more exploring time), better physics, more comfortable UI, much more missions and interesting characters and better system in general. It seems still no main storyline; instead of, there are a lot of side missions, like 1-3 missions in each map. To be honest, I really enjoy this game because of the sandbox system in this game. You can carry or destroy almost everything in this game. For example, if you carry a NPC, they will be angry and attack you (not sure whetherm it still works now). You can also kill every NPC and loot them if you want. And lots of environmental stuff can be destroyed or carried, such as box, fence, stone and bush. It is very nice game for fun, I really enjoy it during exploring. However, it is an early access game and still needs time to develop, such as combat system, enemy species, bugs fixing, magic and skill system, main storyline, multiplayer mode and so on. I recommend buy it with discount because I think this early access game experience not good enough for original price though it has lots of fun.","December 22, 2015","true","5.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","5"

A substantial amount of work has been done since its early access release. Now this game is quite fun to play for extended periods of time. There is a lot to explore, quests available from townsfolk, random dungeons, monsters roaming the land. It is a very fun free-roaming sandbox arpg. Grand Theft Fable?\n\nThe gameplay is pretty basic 3rd person arpg. Not isometric like Diablo et al, but presented in an over- the-shoulder 3rd person perspective like Fable(or GTA). You can be nice and help people, or you can steal from everybody and be a murderous thug. I am sure that at some point a story will be added, but right now it is more of a free-roaming sandbox.\n\nThe combat is slightly loose, and could be tightened up a little bit. For the most part combat works as expected. Sometimes it is a little hard to time strikes perfectly. This is not bad enough to be a serious problem,  just a minor quibble with the gameplay which I'm sure can be adjusted. Even if they leave the combat as is, I'd still be happy with the game. But I could be  happier.\n\nI especially appreciate the graphics, which are slightly cute and cartoonish, yet stunning at the same time with the settings maxed out at 1080p.\n\nThe developers are definitely working dilligently to complete the game.\n\n"Our goal is to make Hardland one of the great action adventure RPGs."\n\n"We want to make Hardland a world full of interesting characters, creatures, quests, and mysterious places. We will not dictate how you should play this game. We merely set the stage and let you make your own decisions. "\n\nI think the developers are well on their way to realizing those goals.\n\nOld review:\n\nThis game is far from done. The art and graphics are great (see screenshots etc...), the gameplay is coming together(per developer 70% complete).  The game world, on the other hand, still has a way to go (per developer only 20% complete). When complete, I think it will be a great open world fantasy arpg.\n\nI would not buy this if you are looking for something you can put lots of hours into immediately. However if you want to support what I think will become a very fun game.... I can't wait to play this game when the gameworld is closer to 75% ready!","October 23, 2014","true","1.8"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","32","48","0","0"

Where to start :-).\nFirstly game enviroments feels very much like Cube world more than minecraft in my opinion. The terrain is still somewhat disjointed in places  e.g uneven terrain especially roads (unlike Cubeworlds beautiful smoothness in creating terrain and especially roads through the terrain). The terrain has some great effects when travelling from biome to biome (much better than Cube world in my opinion). Overall still really enjoying the terrain and just wandering about (which I did a lot in Cube world). Towns seem to be in the game but other than the  starting town (with walls around it) the other towns just seem barren by comparrison (just a few  buildings scattered quite far from one another  and  no road going  through them in most cases.  I hope the developers plan to tweak and add  more to the current towns on roads and make them unique in each biome (eg different looking buildings - e.g. in forrest roofs made out of leaves, plains roofs made out of hay etc......). Gameplay is interesting. It is somewhat basic at this time (although being an Alpha I expect that will hopefully change for the better). Finding items out in the wild is very limited at this time (the best thing I found randomly was a Magnificent Key). Most of the time you will find chests with no keys or barrels filled with fruit (very useful). Keys in particular seem very hard to find (too hard in my opinion). You can level up as you explore/fight although the effects do not seem to do much at this time (im my opinion). And yes I know it does raise my health  as I level up. Also have not found any major weapon upgrades other that armor shoulder pads at this time. one time found a spellbook (from a dead friendly AI) and could not figure how to use it, and  also a glowing green staff.  (most of my time was exploring anyway so not important). I feel this game has alot of potential like Cube world. I hope they are able to continue to work on this jem. The graphics look great although this game seems to struggle on my system (i5- 3550,  8gb ram and a 295 GTX graphics card). Make sure you turn down AA expecially. I was having a slide show when trying to run on Ultra with 4x AA enabled. Much better with Medium with 2x AA enabled although I does still seem to chug at times (obviously being an Alpha I also understand that tuning with come later - maybe at the  beta stage). Basically at the end of  the  day I do not regret purchasing this game at all and really looking forward to what they do next. I have already read on the work on the terrain generation (great) and I hope they can flesh the game out (more weapons,armors etc..) and would like to see some variations on  monsters for specific biomes (e.g. monsters in the snow biome will not be seen in the jungle biome for instance). Great job to the developers. I do not regreat investing my $14.95 purchase price towards supporting this game into a bright future.

The graphics are fun and different, very good IMO.  A lot of the equipment is bigger than your character and won't magically resize to fit you like in most games, so some things are humourously large. There is a fun faction system to play with. The combat is a bit simplistic at the time of writing this, but that goes well with the game's style honestly. I also like the way they handle the armor system, and how it can be destroyed to get at the soft bits (unless you're fighting a skeleton) underneath. I think all this stuff is very cool, but if you are the kind of person that needs flawless, in depth combat and want all your games to look like far cry or COD, this might not be what you are looking for.

It's a wonder to behold.\n\n--UPDATE--\n\nAfter playing the game more, I'm finding a lot more depth in the game. I have only slightly explored two areas of the game, but spent about an hour in each one. The fact is, destroying things is just so much fun to do, and there are little secrets and hidden gems everywhere.\n\nI'm floored by the art style, and the attention to detail is astonishing. I also just realised that the ground itself is destructable... That's not something I expected.\n\nI killed a goblin that was carrying an exploding bolt crossbow. I know how an exploding bold crossbow, and I have learned that many more items are destructable in the game than I had first imagined. Additionally, I learned that stones (which look like props) actually have ore and stuff inside of them. Nice surprise.\n\nAnother really cool feature I noticed is that any enemy that you fight will drop any armor that they are wearing, also their weapons, and some additional loot. But it's cool to see that you get their actual items as loot. On top of that, you can break pieces of their armor off in battle, which is a nice little touch.\n\nRight now, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to have a goal in the game, so I've set myself the goal of collecting bloody goblin hearts from all my victims.\n\nTruth be told, I'm having a lot of fun with this game.","August 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","5"

Id like to see maybe some actual magic put in the game but hey, Early Development is exactly what its states. The development isnt finished (Which is whats giving me hope cause already with the little content i feel like its gold)\n\nQuesting is kinda on the meh side, Only cause of the lack of direction and the lameness of some. Ill say that i ran into a few ones i had fun doing like Agest 47 was cool but that was the only one that stook out. Make more quest people will remember when they are playing and go back and think "Oh yeah, that was a fun one" not "Well that was kinda boring"\n\nIm kinda not into the fact that their will be a few open areas and then some trees bunched up. Idk, just weird imo\n\nAnd maybe lets make it so we can have our weapons out and not get attacted by the entire game.\n\nAdd more stats to some items so they are less cosmetic and have actual use.\n\nAnd maybe add some char creation? (I know you guys are probably working on that but  thought id say it anyways :,) )\n\nAnd one last thing THIS GAME IS OR COULD BE GOLD.\n\nJust listen to the gamers who are putting in some time and dont bail out on us.\n\nReally excited to see how this game turns out :)","March 18","true","9.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Do you want to play a game that is easy to access and makes you smile and laugh without being too silly? Then Hardland is the game for you.\n\nHardland has a perfect balance between moderately challenging gameplay and the fun of exploration and looting. This game was not designed to challenge your skills, but rather it was designed to make you smile. And guess what... we all need to take a break sometimes and enjoy something goofy, right?\n\nIn the Early Access version, you start with a default warrior character who gains experience by killing creatures (and completing some quests). There is no skill tree at this point. Gaining levels will simply improve your health and damage and allow you to equip higher level items. Simple and straightforward.\nMost environmental object can be destroyed (except very large objects like trees and buildings) and almost always contains something you can use including gold, simple weapons and healing items.\n\nSo you can see the game has some sandbox and open-world features. The only thing that would complete the picture would be a skill tree and crafting system, preferably the latter. I'm not sure if these are being planned or not, but they would definitely make the game a more decent experience.\n\nBut the most amusing features in this game would be:\nthe wacky enemies and the items that you can loot from their corpses.\nYou can kill merchants (or zombie merchants) to take their guns. You can kill a skeleton wearing a chicken mask to take his mask that allows you to attract chicken. You can kill a goblin to take his enchanted hammer or axe. Everything you see can be yours if you can take it by force! This makes you want to explore and find MORE enemies to destroy and loot. That would be the most fun feature of the game right now.\n\nThe combat itself is nothing too special. You can exploit the enemy's blind spots and just mash the attack button until they're dead. Not too challenging, they will always hit you the exact same way, very predictable. And their hit detection is not great. Perhaps this will be improved in the future?\n\nSo as you can see, there is lots of potential and lots of room for improvement. They need to add more NPCs, the quests have to be elaborated more, the quest bugs must be fixed. The map needs to be made more clear (I can't find the entrance to a dungeon using the map). The enemies must be made more challenging.\nOne annoying thing right now is that every time I try to help the town guard fight an enemy, if I attack the guard ONLY ONCE BY MISTAKE >> he will chase me and try to kill me non-stop!\nOf course, there is no crime system right now, so you can pretty much kill all guards outside the town and no one would care.\n\nIf you like the concept based on this description, feel free to support the developers and buy it now. This is a good game to buy for your kids if you are introducing them to the 3rd person RPG genre (particularly if they are less than 12 years old), but it's also ok for your own casual game requirements. Otherwise, just keep your expectations to a healthy minimum until the full release.\nEarly Access rating : 7/10\n\nYou can check out my playthrough below for more details. I hope you like it! :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bePp-_l56QI&list=PLP90â™¥â™¥â™¥lxXzipUdOdeekhdEXKQU3zUFwP","May 4, 2015","true","4.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

While the art direction wasn't and still isn't my cup of tea, it seemed to have great potential if expanded on and better optimized. With this in mind, I decided to wait a few months and see what the devs would come up with given time.\n\nImagine my surprise then when I downloaded it again mid-year, only to find it had not only failed to improve in practically every aspect, but even regressed. Gone was the vast open world I'd enjoyed, replaced short chain of miniscule pregenerated maps and an endless, empty dungeon. Removed was the feeling of exploration and progression, the excitement and fun replaced with a struggle to progress anywhere that felt far more like a chore. The devs have promised to expand upon the existing game in the past few months, but so far the best they've managed is to shoehorn in a handful of mechanics that were in the original draft.\n\nElephant people and elven wizards aside, their focus on prettier graphics and visual effects over replay value and depth will ultimately lead to just another average mid-tier indie RPG. Assuming they stay the course with their new design plan, I can't recommend this game over the plethora of other such games available on steam.","September 11, 2015","false","8.7"," 53 of 97 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","53","97","6","8"

So far I am impressed. The graphics are so awesome and unique. The combat is great, both ranged and melee! Like really great! The world, while emptyish right now, is beautiful and a blast to explore. There's a reason I generally don't do early access and I pray the Devs will do the right thing here. If they do this game will be something very very special. I've heard it compared to Skyrim meets Pixar in other reviews and that analogy is perfect. I am pretty hyped for this one and can't wait to see how it comes out. I would say get it.

It's like Shrek and Zelda had a baby. I like it, I really do. Just the artistic style draws you in. Yeah, the combat is simple, but it's good. Hope they add more combos in the full release. The map seems large, still  haven't gone too far from the starting area. I'm staying close until I level up more because I know I'll only get killed lol(my Fallout intuition). The major complaint that is really starting to drive me nuts though is the lack of quest markers. I have NO IDEA where to go or what to do. This is early access I know, and hopefully they add them in the full release, but still there's no excuse. I love exploring, but atleast give me a clue which direction I need to head. As of right now it is 80% finished according to the devs. So, I'm anxiously waiting the upcoming big updates.

The visuals are kind of fairy tale like and childish but that is what draws you into the whole game world as you play.

It has advanced spell/lighting effects, beautiful zones that have only gotten better as the game has progressed, and just a unique aesthetic all around.\n\nBe warned though: there isn't a whole lot of 'game' just yet, as the quests are very limited and there's very little story that I have seen.

It was first a random-gen RPG adventure action game, now it's a lot less random-gen. The wilderness and dungeons are random-gen though It's dissapointing, but the developers couldn't handle pushing out updates and having it be completely random-gen. This game is awesome, but really? I could wait 3-4 months for updates as long as it was completely random-gen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpectreOne/recommended/321980/","SpectreOne","SpectreOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpectreOne/","171 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThese guys know where it is at. This game plays seemlessly, loads quickly, and the melee combat is challenging. Not much content as of yet, I played through most of what was there in less that 5 hours, but from what info I have collected thus far the game is updated quite frequently. The game is early access and I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT. If the game continues as it has progressed up till now It will definately be a fun game when they finish it. They expect to finish it soon (eta sometime 2015), however they have left it open to modders to tinker a little bit. In short, if there is something you don't like come release, we can always make it better ourselves.\n\nThe following is some pros/cons/scrutinies towards how my experience so far has been.\n\nPROS:\nEvery melee fight is difficult, not because things have tons more health than you, but because the hitboxes are so precise that it takes a little while to get used to. Good thing the computer has the same problem. Ex: Zelda OoC-like playstyle.\nQuests are straightforward and usually localized - Meaning you dont have to trek across the world 40 times to pick up some idiot's hat he left in some dungeon.\nUpdated frequently - every week or so come back to check out the new stuff they have added.\nPlenty of weapons and all weapons have prefixes to change their damage or give them some cool visual effect.\n\nDid you ever enjoy tht feeling of running though a town smashing boxes and pots in a Zelda Game? Well now it's barrels. and lots of them. Have fun! CONS/General Scrutiny:\nThe prefixes for weapons are there, but the effects on the weapons are minimal at best. Gold value for the prefixes is wierd too. For example: The "Crossbow" is worth around 1000 gold. While the "True Crossbow" is worth around 600 and the latter does more damage. What?\n\nYou beat people with wands and they do rediculous amounts of damage. What? Some sort of magic in future updates?\n\nRandom drop chance items. --> I picked up the a "SPECIAL CROSSBOW" (explosive bolts) from the first enemy I encountered. Which Made the game really a point-and-shoot vs an actually difficult game.\n\nOn to the subject of crossbows, I would really like to see some sort of aiming requirement to shoot them. It would limit close range combat while emphasizing the need to pre-plan your attack instead of just running in guns-blazing and managing to beat even the toughest enemy without him even coming close to you. Kinda spoils combat a little bit. Also, missing an enemy who is right in front of you but on a different elevation is irritating.\n\nBarrels and other inanimate objects rarely hold anything I would deem worthy of missing them 20 times just to break it. I used polearms most of the game and it is rediculous how difficult it is to break a barrel with one. I do this because someone decided to make one out of every hundred inanimate objects blow up on you and you can survive 2-3 explosive barrels more while using a polearm vs a sword/hammer.\n\nIs there no body armor yet? I have practically cleared every area so far only to find helmets and shields being the #1 widely used form of armor.\n\nI would really like some sort of abilities for each monster or some sort of terrifying monster to pop out every once in a while. Everything is almost just another reskin of every other enemy. This makings learning combat styles uneventful.On a side note: I picked up a fox, opened my inventory and moved it there. The fox was then destroyed, same with chickens and sheep I also tried this with. I thought I was being clever, but it seems there is some sort of whitelist/blacklist for items that are allowed in your inventory. Oops.\n\nTL;DR\nGreat game. Buy it, support the devs. When it is done, you wont regret it. They have some work to do, but that is mostly the more finite points (models/story/developing the world/AI). It played better and smoother than almost any AAA title right off the bat which is why they have my support. FINALLY! A WELL OPTIMIZED GAME! Few bugs here and there, but overall I am impressed. Also, despite where it is at regarding development and completion I had fun playing through every minute of it. Even when I blew myself up like five times.","April 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Our goal is to make Hardland one of the great action adventure RPGs. We would be thrilled to have you join us on this journey to find out what the land ruled by the dying Elder King is truly like. Hardland is currently in a pre-alpha stage which means there are many unfinished features and content missing from the game. We estimate to be able to release the finished game during 2015.\n\nWe want to make Hardland a world full of interesting characters, creatures, quests, and mysterious places. We will not dictate how you should play this game. We merely set the stage and let you make your own decisions. ""\n\n\nthis game is shaping up to be a nice hack'n slash action rpg adventure.","September 7, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I didn't spend much time in it because i got bored. I probably should preface that and admit that I didn't try to go all that far into the game, but if I was bored less than an hour in I wasn't sure I could tank through the boredom to find entertainment. Honestly the only problem I had was the combat. I understand its an early access game and things will improve with time and I have high hopes to maybe purchase this again in the future. For now though it was better for me to simply refund it since the combat seems insanely repetitive at the moment and the rest of the game other than visually isnt fleshed out enough yet to make up for that.","February 25","false","0.6"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

However I can't even call this an alpha at this stage. There is nothing you can do in the game aside from walking around. Horribly buggy, it almost seems unfair that the devs are charging people for such an unfinished product. Do not buy this unless you are a QA ethusiast or you just like looking at pretty stuff.\n\nDespite the negatives I am still keeping my copy in the hope that it eventually turns into something playable.","March 8","false","4.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I'm giving up on this. Money loss. My verdict is: DON'T buy it. Save your money for some indie game that cares about the player community.\n_________________________________________________________\n\n\nYes! They are still updating the game.. And not taking that long to do so.. Wich is refreshingly GREAT! They've just made a massive update today and freed the game from many bugs, and added new units like npcs, monsters and many new areas to explore, itens, etc. I'm hyped again. And can assure you guys: This game is WORTH buying. So much potential. Beautiful and original graphics.. Unique gameplay within a persistent world. Imma play now.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nThis is just sad. I bought this game after watching a few videos on youtube of gameplays.. It looked fun, and sure was in the first 20 minutes of gameplay. The lack of direction and objective is REAL. Its just BORING like hell. I do understand that this game is in early access, but there is SO much to work on.. I'm beginning to wonder if the developer will ever release this game some day. I know its not dead (last update was 1 month ago if I'm not wrong), but still. My hopes are dying. It has some great potential on this product I say. Also, the graphics are stunning and the animations are professional. But then there is the gameplay with that lack of everything. It only plays well. Not a single bug that could ruin your experience at its current state, but MAN. They're worried about polishing the graphics (see the last update) and not worring about the game experience at all! That worries me deeply. Oh well, I'm not giving up tho. I seriously hope that this game will be really great as it meant to be, some day. Not only because I liked the idea and stuff, but because I've spent MONEY on this. So, devs, please. Make it worth my (and all of your customers) while.\n\nAnd YES, I will be glad to change this review status to POSITIVE as soon as I see some things changed on this game. Currently, I'm just disappointed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zreese/recommended/321980/","zreese","zreese","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zreese/","1207 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI purchased Hardland on Wednesday, April 22nd, 2015, at 9:30 PM EST. I bought it because it had a great name. "Hardland." It evokes a lot. It was also on sale. The game took fifteen minutes to install.\n\nI clicked through some menus and cutscenes. I was in control of an avatar that bore little resemblance to me. I could press keys on my keyboard and move my mouse to control the square little man and make him do things like walk around and swing a sword. I pressed keys to make him walk to a big swirling vortex.\n\nI wandered for a bit, exploring. There were trees and rocks and other forest things. There were giant apples. They had words over them that said GIANT APPLES and they had a health bar so maybe they were enemies. I could attack them with my sword and eventually they would explode into an impossible number of giant apple slices. You could walk up to chickens and they would say "Bwock, bwock!" Perhaps a political reference? It's hard to say either way.\n\nThere were some pigs, both big and small. I killed the pigs with my sword, and then some other animals. The sword makes a satisfy ssssswop sound when it connects, but the sound effect isn't at all dynamic so it becomes trance inducing through persistent repetition. I found some people and killed them too. If you hit someone with your sword, their name turns red and they run away. But only for a few seconds. Then they forget that they should be scared of you and you can just walk up and strike them with the sword again. You can keep doing this until they die.\n\nWhen people are killed things fall out of them. Cinnamon rolls, potatoes, forks, torches, hats, large bottles of poison, three-tiered fondant cakes. All sorts of things. I'm not sure what these people intended to do with all these things. I just left them on the ground.\n\nYou don't run very fast, so it takes a long time to go from one village to another to find villagers. Perhaps the players should be able to kill someone and take their shoes and different shoes let you move at different speeds. Again, this is an early access game, and a lot can change, so maybe the developers have already thought of this.\n\nWhile I was looking for the next village I found a knight named Bald Travis and I put him in the ground. That is to say: I hit him and he fell over stiffly and his upper torso clipped through the ground. His squiggly disproportionate feet stuck up like marigolds. All the people in this game are oddly dysmorphic. They are all short, stout, thick. It makes me think about why my own body is constructed the way it is, which is something I don't like to do.\n\nI wandered some more. There was a boar stuck inside a tree, like the tree had grown through him, but he was still alive and thrashing violently. His name was Raggi the Maneater. I went over to try and help him, but merely making contact with him seemed to be fatal. My body went limp and a dozen bejeweled crowns exploded from within me. There was also one quarter of a watermelon and my quiet, un-beating heart.\n\nAt that point I decided I had played enough to form a proper assessment of all the game had to offer. This is a work in progress, and there isn't enough polish to hold my attention. It feels like there's a lot of obvious areas to improve upon. I wish I could remove people's shoes when they die, or otherwise dress them how I wanted. I wish the animals said more things when you talked to them. I wish there were mini-games, like maybe you mash keys and fill a meter to put a sleeper hold on a villager. Those are all things that would make a much more engaging experience for a player like me. But for now, Hardland seems aimless and unnecessary.","April 24, 2015","false","0.8"," 11 of 51 people (22%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","22","11","51","5","2"

I understand that this is an early access game, but the game is horribly balanced. Most enemies kill you in one hit, and when you die, you return to the very beginning. You lose everything, except a useless wooden sword, and you lose all XP. Add that to the total lack of direction. The game, in it's current state, isn't really a game. More like a sandbox with nothing to do. Also, the game has almost no draw distance, and that appears to be a feature. Objects pop in and out depending on your distance, but the way they do so (rising from the ground) tells me that that was the developers intention. I might try this game again in 1-2 years, when it's finished.","December 8, 2014","false","0.5"," 20 of 122 people (16%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","16","20","122","0","11"

The biggest thing that sticks out to me is the environment that you are playing in and the art style used. It is very unusual but for me was a very welcome change. The combat and quests are about average and nothing to write home about but overall the game has a lot of promise.  As with all things early access, time will tell whether it lives up to that promise and if you are not one to gamble, then I would wait.

The Special Crossbow kills me if I aim too high, I'm not sure what is causing this colision but it lead me to not use the weapon entirely.\n\n2. Randomly exploding 3 different times while looting near goblin kings. I did not see anything explosive laying around to cause it, not sure if this is an error or I am blind.\n\n3. Enemy aggro range seems short, I don't like that I am allowed to single out monsters on the edge of squads/armies without getting swarmed by the whole group.\n\n4. Stamina doesn't seem taxing enough when you run out. You cant jump, run or dodge but you can still go ham with your weapon. I guess if you want to encourage berzerker playstyles this is fine as is if stronger monsters are introduced, but with a 500 damage ice wand I just run around and 1-3 hit everything without needing to dodge or block.","December 30, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
