Blubb! Blubb!"\nThese sounds will follow you into your dreams after you've played Lightfish too much ...\nI was looking forward to a Qix clone which is placed in the deep sea ocean environment. This game is in arcade style and graphics and music fits together perfectly. They're unique and I liked the soundtrack composed by James Dean.\n\nBut this Blubb sound making me dumb. I'm not sure if it causes the occurring game crashes. Another gap are the imprecise controls. It can happen easily that during linemaking you missed the way back to your start point or you accidently touch the lava. Really annoying are the partly unfair game mechanics like a crab that spawns directly at your position. Enemies are stuck between lava and blocks and flipper uncontrollable until they release. Or big creatures pass somehow through narrow passages ...\n\nSo it was strange that the time trial mode was quite easier to me than the adventure mode.\nTime trial mode means clearing the map quickly and don't take care of points. But it was also random if there spawns the helpful playtime extender or something other useless powerup .\n\nThe adventure mode turns out unnatural hard in some levels (especially if you want to make it with 3 stars). Normally you try to raise your multiplicator by trapping enemies in small boxes without using too much percentage of the game surface. If your multiplicator has become max you can clear the map to the end and get a huge bonus. In the hardest level "Ladder" (Lvl 4.8) there are somehow other rules. It seemed that it must be done in fast time to get the 3 stars finish.\n\nAlltogether the game makes fun, but the bugs going sometimes on nerves. I cannot explain myself how people can beat this game in less than 3 hours ...","July 21, 2014","true","13.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Claim a certain amount of territory, and you clear the map and move on to the next one.\n\nLightFish is pretty basic - and maybe a bit shallow - but it works well enough: the controls are responsive, and the graphics and music are quite pleasant. The "Story" mode (such as it is) can be completed in a couple of hours, but maps can be replayed at any time if you want to improve your score.

WHY??? surely a big part of this type of game is making traps in the map to remove enemies to make the rest of the level easier to capture. Again this seems to promote a rushed approach rather than the strategic play this type of game should have. Oh and also the walls that kill you? what a silly idea.

It's Qix, but dressed up in fancy vector-looking graphics and set in a computerized looking acquatic environment.  As such the game doesn't have the abstract power of the Qix presentation, but the mechanics are exactly the same and so you'll find the same sense of enjoyment as the venerable old arcade game.  The new updates involve some different types of opponents which exhibit different behaviors (one will explode near you, another will seek you out when you draw your lines, and another just floats around getting in your way).  There's also different elements that you traverse when drawing out your territory which can slow you down, block you, or kill you if you touch it which add to the variety of the task.\n\nI like it, but it's a very slight game and not one you're likely to pick up and play a whole lot unless you just happen to be in the mood for Qix action.  I thought the music was okay although it's very much Amiga old school mod music.

Stray too close and you're crispy-fried.\n\nIce walls slow your movement, but if you can break your way through them, they fall apart entirely. Watch out for enemies that aren't slowed by the ice.\n\nExploding jellyfish try to reach for you if you get too close, and their area of effect explosions can catch you in the blast if you don't keep your distance.\n\nThese are but a few of the innovative mechanics that Lightfish has to help separate itself from the pack and provide a fresh experience among Qix-inspired titles.","August 11, 2012","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're a fish who starts at the edge of a rectangular map and swims in straight lines to clear off sections of the map until about 75%, after which you're scored and given 1-3 stars.  You increase your score by capturing (destroying) enemies and powerups within your rectangles, clearing off larger sections of the map with one move, finishing the level more quickly and by playing on hard difficulty where enemies are faster and respawn (recommended for a challenge and high scores).\n\nWhile in the process of swimming from one safe point to another you leave a line behind you and are vulnerable, so If an enemy runs into your path you die. New enemies and obstacles are introduced at a fast enough rate to keep things fresh and the campaign will last 2-3 hours.  In addition there's a time trial mode and online leaderboards, though I didn't see a filter for friends unfortunately.  Looks nice, good music, easy achievements.

In later levels the screen becomes cluttered with obstacles and enemies, making it difficult to focus on a winning strategy. Since there are certain enemies that are completely unpredictable it is simply easier to brute force your way through a level by being cautious rather than cunning.\n\nMajor grievances include: poor enemy spawning, sometimes an enemy will spawn right on top of you and kill you without warning; imprecise controls which caused a number of lava related deaths or by getting stuck on geometry; no restart button, somewhat of a necessity to let the player quickly restart the level if they are going for a top score.\n\nYou won't get much play time or challenge out of Lightfish and the lack of variety in mechanics and level design leaves a lot to be desired.","December 9, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I felt that it was visually overstimulating, with too many flashy graphics making it difficult to see everything that's going on. Basically it's full of substanceless flashy graphics which actually hinder gameplay instead of enhancing it. It's quite a short game and it's by no means a challenge. The few instructions that exist in the game are poorly written (or translated), which says to me that no one really cared too much. I found the lava walls a little questionable when the controls aren't precise enough and a safe distance from them a matter of trial and error every time.\n\nThe objective of the game is to capture areas of the game screen. You are safe from most creatures on your baseline (though not all). You dash out and try not to get hit by enemies, and once you capture 75% of the original area, you win the level.\n\nIf you're looking for a game of this sort, then I would strongly recommend you consider Fortix2 instead (which also has a section that includes the Fortix original levels in the Fortix2 artwork). The Fortix games are more challenging (if you play on hard), more engaging, have more levels, are better thought out, and last but not least, they're a whole lot more fun than Lightfish. Also, I think that the Fortix games on an easy difficulty setting are easier than this game because the controls and game mechanics are better.\n\nI've enjoyed the game for a few hours, but I'm not sure it was worth it. Depends on what $5 is worth to you, how bored you are, and how much you love this sort of game.

There is another Qix-style game on Steam, Fortix (and Fortix 2).  But that game ruined it by terrible controls.\n\nLightfish did it right!  You hold a button if you want to draw.  If you don't hold the button, you can only move around existing lines.  Fortix could have been fantastic IF THEY JUST DID THE CONTROLS RIGHT.  I loved the additional element of turrets that shoot at you.  But they ruined it with terrible controls (sigh).  So close.\n\nAnyway.. Lightfish is doing it better.  I'm only an hour into the game and new elements are getting peppered into the game.  I hope they introduce an alternate drawing button that draws slower but gives more points (like the original Qix).\n\nIf you are looking to scratch a Qix-itch; Lightfish is a good choice to make.\n\nMy largest crit is some of the sound effects are over-driven and sound distorted.","January 2","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
