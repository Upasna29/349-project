"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/279800/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","Grim Legends has easily become one of my favorite Artifex Mundi series, with a theme centering around Brothers Grimm Fairytale collection. Each new game is an original and beautiful interpretation of one of their collected European fairytales. Thus, there is no story consistency between games in the series. You can pick and enjoy them as stand-alones. Being a lovely interpretation of The Six Swans story, Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan is no different.\n\nHere, we take the role of a healer, brought in to the Eagle Kingdom to find a solution to the young and beautiful Queen's unknown ailment. She has never spoken a word for the years that she has passed with her beloved King; not even after the birth of their son. According to Queen Mother - the Peacock Lady - all she ever does is weaving shirts out of nettle without ever resting. As we just start to examine the young Queen, a sinister green smoke breaks into her chamber, engulfing her and the heir. When the smoke is gone, so is the heir. The Peacock Lady steadily accuses the Young Queen with witchcraft - punishable by burning at the stake as the laws of the land dictate. Suspicious of this accusation, the King pleads with us to find a way to prove her innocence. So, our journey towards the Swan Kingdom - the homeland of the Queen - in hopes of finding proof of her innocence begins. We are to learn of an old tragedy, unmask the real villain and break a curse while we are at it.\n\nMaybe not as dramatic or impressive as the first game, Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan is still a beautiful interpretation of the original tale and a well-made addition to the series. Artworks are trademark Artifex Mundi at this point: vibrant, appealing and picturesque. Character designs themselves are quite fitting for the tale, with thriving animations, mimics and color choices. Voice acting is not spectacular, but still well above average. Whenever I write about one of these HOGs hailing from Artifex Mundi, I feel like working on a paying advertisement; but I swear that's not the case. Their work in these silly casual games is nearly always that good, that's all.\n\nGameplay though, is a bit sterile in this one compared to other Artifex Mundi games. We don't have as many HOG scenes as we'd expect. The game is dominated by FROG - Fragmented Object Games - where you are expected to collect pieces of a certain item to make a whole, then use as a part of another item combination. Puzzles are fine - nothing shallow or suicidal, just the right amount of brain scratching, if not a bit basic. Compared to other titles, there is a fair amount of backtracking too, so be ready to recall details from past environments if you are playing in expert difficulty. There is domino or mahjong alternative gameplay here, since there isn't much HOG scenes to alternate between anyhow so one playthrough would be suffice for collecting all achievements.\n\nBy the end, this second instalment in the series, is a beautiful game appropriate for a lazy midweek afternoon. Grab it on sale and admire some beautiful artwork accompanied by a neat selection of puzzles and an enchanting retelling of a Grimm Brothers story.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 16","true","5.2"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","33","33","0","0"

The game is based on the popular fairy tale "The Wild Swans" by Handersen, and features gorgeous backgrounds, beautiful music and an engaging story, as well as excellent voice acting. As a bonus, you'll get companions like a bird, a fairy and a cute otter :3\n\nEven though it's part of the "Grim Legends" series, it works as a stand alone game so you don't really need to play the first one (which is a pleasant game too).\n\nI definitely recommend it if you're looking for a relaxing, cozy adventure game\n\n8/10","March 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","30","33","2","0"

They make these well folks, always.\n\nThis time you get to play in a 1700ty/1800ty ish fantasy playground. Fight Dark sorcery with herbal spells and your ability to find those lost bits.\n\nDo you know the Dark Swan myth? Then you understand the plot. Ever want to play a part within a old myth? Here you get to. That's the joy of this series. There are a few twists and those are the fun surprises.\n\nThis isn't part 2 of the story of Grim Legends 1, it's a second grim legend. If they ever make a third one I can easily imagine it will be yet a another different legend.\n\nPros\nNice music.\nWell use of voice acting.\nIt's pretty. Just plain outright pretty to look at and watch.\nMiddle level gameplay. Spend a few mins and you'll rarely have to use the hint button.\n\nCons (of a sort)\nLack of gameplay inovation. It's just like nearly every other well made hidden object game. This isn't a bad thing but it's almost as if they used a formula.\nNot really a mystery, if you rember the myth.\n\n\nThis is a really well made hidden object game. Definatly worth buying and adding to your collection.\n\n\nInterested in more reviews like this : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation","September 27, 2015","true","5.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","3"

The tone is darker, with much more death; there's no single cute helper; the familiar "find the object OR play the game" is swapped out for smaller hunts. The music isn't quite as atmospheric and the sense of mystery and discovery is swapped out for, well, an actual mystery you  have to solve. Having to meet more people and talk to them changes the sense of isolation and exploration from the first game. There's less exploring a new world and more unraveling the past. Is it better? Depends on what you want.\n\nAlso I have to say it: that face in the one hidden object game came off as a little, um. Racist?","March 26, 2015","true","5.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nolendil/recommended/279800/","Nolendil","Nolendil Valaina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nolendil/","854 products in account","Pros:\n- Descent music, sounds and voices\n- Graphics are fine\n- Some puzzles are a bit more original than usual\n- I always enjoy the theatre-like puzzles\n- Uses the modern interface/system of the more recent games from this company\n\nCons:\n- Animations are sometimes weird, as in all their other games, since they are based more on blending and morphing pictures than different frames. However, it's quite well done for this type of animation.\n- Several hidden objects scenes have objects with arbitrary shapes that look like nothing you're familiar with and that makes them artificially hard to find.\n- Not enough hidden objects scenes for this type of game.\n- The maze section relies on clues that are not clear: I finished the game 3 times and I'm still not sure I understood the logic.\n- A few puzzles are illogical (more than the average for this kind of game). For instance, using the saliva of the "snail" to glue the eagle figurine. Firstly, using saliva to glue stone makes no sense. Secondly, you have to put the piece on the saliva directly, while the game got you used to collect liquids in recipients before using them.\n- There's also one instance where you have to backtrack way too much just to get one object that was hard to notice in the first place. You have to get out of the Dark Castle to get the arrow for the crossbow.\n- Lastly, and that's disapointing for this type of game, I didn't like the story: it made no sense to me, probably because it was badly told.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile it's not a terrible game, it is one of the worst HO games from Artifex Mundi.\nI didn't enjoy it as much as their other titles. I'd recommend playing those instead, unless you've finished them all already.","October 25, 2015","false","6.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/recommended/279800/","erbkaiser","Erbkaiser ♔","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erbkaiser/","4510 products in account","On its own, this is a good hidden object game. Puzzles are detailed and beautiful, the storyline is well worked out and, while lifting on a well-known fairytale, still has twists.\nAll screens are partially animated, making the world feel alive, and the cinematic scenes are the developer's best work yet.\n\nCompared to its predecessor however, Grim Legends 2 disappoints a little. Voice acting is of a lesser quality, with even cases where the subtitles and voice dialogue don't match.\nGameplay wise, there is only one kind of optional collectable to the previous games' two kinds, and you can no longer opt out of a hidden object puzzle for another kind of game: you now only have the option to use the hint button instead.\n\nFortunately both have standalone stories, so you won't necessarily need to buy "2" for story reasons.\n\nGood is that the companion idea from the previous game returns, with now not just one critter helping you, but a new one per chapter. They are also used more, and feel more relevant to the story.\nThere is also more variation in the puzzles this time than just combine A with B or slide puzzles, so there is less idea of repetition here. You also backtrack less than in Grim Legends 1.\n\nOverall Grim Legends 2 is a polished game well worth playing, but I feel more could have been done with it to make it a proper sequel to the first game. Taking it as a standalone though, I can definitely recommend it.","April 6, 2015","true","5.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

It's got a beautiful setting, and a fun story. The puzzles and hidden object games are well done. And it's got both polish and heart. I love the company that makes these games, and they seem to keep getting better at what they do.\n\nAs with the other Artifex Mundi games, I'd highly recommend this one to anyone interested in puzzles, hidden object games, and original stories. Plus, no need to play the first game to enjoy this one.","June 5, 2015","true","5.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

One of the games I have tried is GL: The Forsaken Bride but I really liked this one better, everything from the soundtrack (which is amazing), storyline, characters was very well thought out.\n\nIn GL2: Song of the Dark Swan, you are a healer summoned by the king to check on the health condition of his queen. Without giving it away, let's just say that you end up getting more than what you signed in for ehehe. The story is interesting, much more than the Forsaken Bride, more so that at some point you even feel sorry for what is happening to some of the characters and that is something that I didn't feel while playing FBride.\n\nThe minigames/puzzles are quite similar to the one's on FBride so you won't feel much difficulty there if you managed to do them on the previous game. However, If my memory serves me, I think there are a few that are a bit different but still doable.\n\nAs I mentioned before the soundtrack is beautiful, it gives a special touch to the story and makes it even more amazing and captivating. The artwork is fantastic, the characters are wonderfuly presented with nice details.\n\nOh and lets not forget the little helpers! On the Dark Swan they are super cute and, of course, you'll get more than one. For those of you who don't know, on Grim Legends games you usually have little guys that help you advance in the story (don't worry they don't work as hints or cheats, etc).\n\nThe only thing that I liked a bit more on the Forsaken Bride than on Dark Swan was the Bonus Content. I felt that on FB it worked better as a continuance of the main story and I didn't felt that with the DS bonus content.\n\nIf you like games like this then I suggest buying it, being it in a bundle, on sales or at regular price, it's well worth the purchase :)","August 15, 2015","true","9.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This time around it's Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan. I'm going to go ahead and say that this is easily the best HOG I've played yet. Admittedly, it doesn't sound like much since this is also only the fourth one I've played, but all the same. With its combination of spectacular art, great music, a solid story, and quality puzzles, I can't think of a reason for genre fans to avoid this title.\n\nThe plot starts off simple enough. You're a herbalist of some fame, and a king rolls out the red carpet, in the hopes that you can cure his queen's ailment. The queen can't speak and...eh well the rest is on you to figure out. There's a mystery to solve, a handful of twists and turns, and you're going to figure it all out and save the day. However, if you fail then...that would be silly! This is a HOG after all, the answer is always one click away. How you proceed is up to you. Skip through all of the puzzles to focus on the story? Or take your time and get your money's worth?\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the genre, a good Hidden Object Game is more than just finding trinkets. HOGs should also offer numerous puzzles, a compelling plot, and quality presentation. Like most adventure games, a HOG doesn't have much in the way of replay-value, so it's massively important that the few hours of game-play it offers are memorable. Grim Legends 2 is very successful in this regard. The art-direction employs some great usage of colors, and despite lacking 4k or even 2k resolution, can still astonish with its well-drawn environments. For the most part, the hidden object portions of this game are designed intelligently. The pieces are creatively hidden, and are sometimes unique, such as pieces of an elaborate necklace, or the parts of a magnifying glass. The difficulty is also well-balanced, so you'll feel that at least some effort is necessary. This makes progressing through the adventure more fulfilling.\n\nAs far as nitpicks go (don't act so surprised!) the NPCs can look rather strange. It's hard to describe. They have this uncanny valley when they speak to you. Perhaps that isn't the right term for it, but it certainly looks unnatural. Aside from being a blemish on the otherwise fantastic art-direction, weirdo NPC faces isn't a big deal. The herbalist's voice-acting is a little suspect at times, but again...nothing major. Everyone else in the game picks up the slack quite nicely.\n\nAll in all this is a great title to look into whether you're already fans of the genre, or a newcomer looking for a worthwhile entry point.","September 5, 2015","true","7.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It has a real intense story, with even some twists, while at the same time providing a lot of mini games and puzzles. The puzzels mostly fit nicely into the story, which is quite seldom the case. The minigames are varying quite nicely. Beside of some of the hidden object minigames, none is the same as another (sometimes there is more than one of the same time in a sequence). Even the hidden object minigames are varying, which is really great.\n\nBut the element that really keeps one to continue this game is how everything is driven by the story.  The story is provided with small cutscenes and short dialoges. But also by some of the minigames or other things one just discoveres. All those scenes are short enough, so that I never was tempted to skip them. (You get an archivement for not skipping the first ones.)\n\nLast but not least I liked both the graphic and the music. Both added to the atmosphere of the game.","March 28, 2015","true","8.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The artwork is amazing and it's reallly fun to have different animal helpers. The hidden object scenes are typically not your, "here's a list of items to find" but usually find multiple of one type of item in a scene or find all the items pictured below. There are a few typical object scenes but the mixture keeps it fresh and won't leave you randomly clicking by end game. The puzzles are inventive and while a lot are repeated from other games, they've been adjusted for this game's setting and feel new. The voice acting could be better but I think the Princess' was the best... (She's mute btw).\n\nThe story is a bit short, it took me a little over 2 hours to beat but the additional bonus story adds another good hour.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/279800/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 80%Grim Legends 2 is a beautiful fragmented object game set in a fairy tale land. It’s not as memorable as its predecessor, but it can be a great addition to the library of any Artifex Mundi fan.\n\nLong version:Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan is a sequel in name only. The fairy tale setting remained, but everything else changed– including the sub-genre, which is now fragmented object.\n\nThe story is a spin on the Grimm fairy tale ‘The Twelve Brothers’: a heartbroken evil sorceress curses a kingdom, turns the seven sons of the royal family into swans, and their sister mute. You start the game several years later, after said sister married and had a child, whom is promptly kidnapped. Your task is, naturally, to save the infant and break the curse while you’re at it.\n\nThe fragmented object (and the few hidden object) scenes all have the usual high Artifex Mundi quality, whereas the conventional puzzles are a bit repetitive. The story uses a rather strange route with a lot of backtracking. This can make life pretty overcomplicated on the highest difficulty, but it can also give the game an unusually long play time for its worth.","July 14, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","Artifex Mundi is a name that I associate with good quality games. I enjoyed the previous "Grim Legends", so I was really looking forward to this one.\n\nLike\nGraphics\nThe game has wonderful artwork. Very detailed and colorful.\n\nPuzzles\n\nThere's a good variety of them and they are all fairly easy to solve. A tip for someone else: When you need to guide the princess wood piece across the map... don't drag the piece. Just click where you want her to go. I wish I knew that before raging because the piece kept jumping around and breaking the puzzle.\n\nThe hidden object scenes dosen't overload every scene with thousand of objects. All objects are clear and in a realistic size for the environment they are in. Everything is easy to find once you know what you are looking for. There were perhaps 2-3 objects which were a bit colorless that took a harder time to find.\n\nStory\nIt was unusually grim for a Artifex Mundi game. But I like that, it added suspence to the story and even if you didn't get to know the characters too well, you still felt very sorry for them. It deals with a lot of emotions of even the background characters, such as guilt, regret, pain and grief.\n\nDislike\nVoice-acting\n\nIt isn't awful (except for the children), but it is the same woman as every other game. Can't they hire someone else? She is okay, but obviously still can't bother to do any form of shouting or screaming in terror. 2 out of 3 times she doesn't even bother, even though it clearly says "Ah!" in the subtitles.\n\nMain character\n\nThe person you control is only known as "healer" and all she does is make healing brews out of herbs and solve the mystery. I just didn't like her for some reason. Usually I don't care that much about the anonymous main character, but this one was so dense. You figure things out long before she even puts anything together. I guess for the sake of the story she has to be dumb so the player can figure things out on their own, but most things are too obvious not to figure out on your own. She even finds a book that has the solution painted and she still doesn't get it! I can overlook this though for the sake of "story needing to unfold" and if the main character spoils it to early, it might ruin the pace of the story.","July 22, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was confused most of the game. This game seems to be a lot more focused and I also like the graphics a lot. They look like a painting. They are really very good looking. The sound is also another plus.\n\nThe puzzles again are sort of hit and for me mostly a miss. Most just are not a lot of fun. The Guardian footprint puzzle is a good case of what are they thinking? Match the footprint with the animal. Does anyone know what a dragoon foortprint would look like? I didnt. Skip.\n\nThe story is interesting and like I said before the gameplay is more focused. I do understand where to go and why I am going there. You get to have different helpers in this game including a bird and an otter and others. This is a great idea. I like it a lot more then say just having one animal.  So  great graphics, great sound and an interesting and cool story.  This is a good hidden object game. A lot better in my opinion then Grim Legends 1.","September 2, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art, the voice acting, the story, the atmosphere is always on point.\n\nThis is one of their newest releases and it shows! Every time they release a new game the art of the animations gets smoother and more real. Because, let’s face it, there are many HOGs that have great art overall, but when it comes to the animation parts… it’s usually a little wonky.  I’m so happy to say that AM manages to improve with each game they release.\n\nI also really like that the HOG parts of the game itself are not just lists of items you should look for, but also little images of the items you need instead of the words. I’m a fan of the genre, but too many grocery shopping lists in crowded screens gets a little boring sometimes.\n\nThe puzzles in Grim Legends 2 are nothing too hard, though two managed to get me stuck at least 30 minutes each. The difficulty varies from ‘Seeing The Answer Right Away’ to, ‘I’m Just Pressing Random Buttons’ to, ‘I’ll Turn On My Brain Now For Some Serious Thinking’.\n\nThere’s also no need to have played Grim Legends 1 for story purposes, there are achievements all around and you can actually carry the baby. No carrying babies around in inventories, aww yeah.","June 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are very few mini-game puzzles or hidden-object scenes: it's almost purely very easy point-and-click. The story is unrelated to Grim Legends 1, so please ignore that marketing nonsense.\n\nIf I'm really pushed to mention something special about this game (hard!) then I would say that the fareries are really cute. I guess that's something? Otherwise, it's run-of-the-mill fantasy nonsense, king and queen and dark magic and such.\n\nThe "bonus adventure," by the way, is a complete throwaway. The puzzles make zero sense. Just click on everything all the time and you should be OK. ;)\n\nI would also like to thank the developer for supporting Linux.","May 9, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It excels in many areas that most other HOGs fail at:\nStory: Most interesting story I’ve experienced so far.\nGraphics: Definitely a positive factor for this game.  Clean and attractive.\nAnimation: The animation in most HOGs is usually pretty bad- Transitions from static graphics to animation is usually awful.  Not in this game, the transitions are the best I’ve seen.\nPuzzle: First HOG where I was actually stuck on a puzzle for 30 minutes (I refuse to use hints or skips).\n\nCONS:\nThere is currently a bug where one of the sigils does not glow.\nThe game is broken up into parts and you cannot backtrack to clean up achievements.  Because of this and the sigil bug, you will most likely need two playthroughs to obtain all achievements.\nThe voice actor for the children is terrible.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game.

It's a great game for those who either don't like the mainstream type games or need a break from them, because this game makes you think and use your brain in a different way.

On one hand, Artifex Mundi (AM) has improved their Achievements so they aren't mutually exclusive.  In other words, we're not forced to make two run throughs to get all Achievements (yay!).  Also, the graphics seem to be a bit sharper and brighter than earlier games.  On the other hand, the voice acting is much worse than normal.  Some of the voice acting is on par with other AM games (i.e., tolerable).  But, the queen's voice acting is bad and the various children's voice acting is utterly horrible.  I cringed every time I had to click on those kids and listen to their "acting."  Ugh.  To go along with the bad voice acting, the story is even worse than usual for these casual adventure Hidden Object games (HOGs).  So, instead of an OK-cutesy story, this one tends towards the OK-silly side.  If it weren't for the dead bodies lying around, I'd even lean towards it being written for kids (especially in the Bonus Chapter).  I'd also like to mention that even though this game is classified as a HOG, most of the puzzles are NOT technically HOGs:  they're FROGs (Fragmented/Fractured Object Game).  Plus, most of the HOGs are of the type where you have to find a bunch of fairies or a bunch of flowers and not of the type where you have a hodgepodge of various items hidden among other miscellany.  Of course, that could be good or bad, depending on your tastes.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't properly record my actual game play time.  So, I can't give the exact duration of the game.  But, it took me about 8 hours to finish the whole thing with 100% Achievements:  a little over 6 hours for the main game and 1.7 hours for the Bonus Chapter.  So, with the pluses and minuses noted above, coupled with the slightly short game play, I'm recommending the game.  But, only if you can find it on sale.  I'd say you should buy it if you can find it for less than six dollars.","August 5, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is occassionally a hidden object puzzle, but not nearly as many as I was expecting.  It was a good pace, the art was great, and there wasn't any point at which I was really stumped.  More to the point, I was able to find all of the objects within a couple of rooms, and never felt like I was wandering all over the place trying to pixel hunt.\n\nThe story was interesting to follow, though obvious to where it was going.  Most of the voice acting was pretty good -- at least compared to other casual games I've played.  There was only one or two characters (younger boys) that I was taken out of the game by.\n\nOne minor note.. if you have a tablet, the games seem to be quite a bit cheaper there ($5 versus $10), but the steam sales can get down a bit further if you watch for them.","August 5, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good for a few hours of fun if you enjoy the genre.\n\nReviewYou play as the Healer, summoned to the Eagle Kingdom by the Eagle King to cure his nameless mute wife, the mother of his nameless son. Nameless sinister forces are at work however and make your task a great deal harder as the son is kidnapped, the wife accused of magic use (illegal by the decree of the otherwise nameless Peacock Queen, the Eagle King’s mother). Overall I found the story pretty bland and not as enjoyable as Grim Legends: The Forsaken Bride. There is very few twists and for the most part it is just good vs evil. The voice acting is mostly poor and the “characters” are incredibly one-dimensional – in case you had missed it, not a single person in the game even has a name. Hell, the wife’s nickname from one of her forest friends is “little P” for little princess. Lazy.\n\nStill, the game looks good and mechanically it is fine. Nothing really inventive or super challenging, but decent variety of HOGS and puzzles. So I would say it is good for a few hours of relaxing HOGing (I finished both the main story and the extra chapter in about 6.6 hours on Expert difficulty and with all achievements), but if you are looking for a challenge, inventive puzzles or a compelling story… look elsewhere.","November 20, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On one hand, Artifex Mundi (AM) has improved their Achievements so they aren't mutually exclusive.  In other words, we're not forced to make two run throughs to get all Achievements (yay!).  Also, the graphics seem to be a bit sharper and brighter than earlier games.  On the other hand, the voice acting is much worse than normal.  Some of the voice acting is on par with other AM games (i.e., tolerable).  But, the queen's voice acting is bad and the various children's voice acting is utterly horrible.  I cringed every time I had to click on those kids and listen to their "acting."  Ugh.  To go along with the bad voice acting, the story is even worse than usual for these casual adventure Hidden Object games (HOGs).  So, instead of an OK-cutesy story, this one tends towards the OK-silly side.  If it weren't for the dead bodies lying around, I'd even lean towards it being written for kids (especially in the Bonus Chapter).  I'd also like to mention that even though this game is classified as a HOG, most of the puzzles are NOT technically HOGs:  they're FROGs (Fragmented/Fractured Object Game).  Plus, most of the HOGs are of the type where you have to find a bunch of fairies or a bunch of flowers and not of the type where you have a hodgepodge of various items hidden among other miscellany.  Of course, that could be good or bad, depending on your tastes.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't properly record my actual game play time.  So, I can't give the exact duration of the game.  But, it took me about 8 hours to finish the whole thing with 100% Achievements:  a little over 6 hours for the main game and 1.7 hours for the Bonus Chapter.  So, with the pluses and minuses noted above, coupled with the slightly short game play, I'm recommending the game.  But, only if you can find it on sale.  I'd say you should buy it if you can find it for less than six dollars.","August 5, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To top it off, all of the ones I have played so far have very interesting and engaging stories, and GL2 is probably the high point for me so far.\n\nMy only slight gripe is the occasional typo or other grammar mistakes, but as the AM team is based in Poland, I do not begrudge them that.","June 4, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Again, you play a female protagonist (this time the unnamed healer) as you amble through a retelling of a fairy tale, although given the choice of fairy tale this renders certain elements of the tale quite nonsensical.\n\nCompared to the others by this developer I found this one relied a little too often on obscuring items with immovable objects which made them awkward to spot, but none of the puzzles, hidden object or otherwise, are too hard. The bonus chapter is set before the story but has no real relationship to it. I've gotta say I barely noticed the soundscapes, and where Grim Legends had a cute kitten, it felt like they'd tried to improve on that by offering you a variety of helpers throughout the game, but with such a short game and such infrequent use of the various companions it was hard to be too attached. Still they were all cute and the game is just fine. I suspect the it was the mangling of one of my favourite childhood tales that irked me slightly with this one.\n\nOh and the pronunciation of "ginormous."","June 4, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I think it could be better if the other brothers who were harmed by the dark swan can be revived, and more explainations about why the Queen had to make the sweater as well as why there were rashes on her hand. It is kind of confusing for those who haven't read the original story.\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend the game, and many thanks to the developing team for creating such a nice game.\nBest regards.","June 6, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice-overs and story coherence were above par, IMO (though it's clear from the beginning who the villain is). The puzzles seemed to get more annoying later in the game, but i'm not really a puzzle person, and that's what the Skip button is for :-D. i found myself needing a Hint on how to continue now and then, unfortunately, but that's my problem, not the game's.\n\nDown-side: other than being short (finished it in under 4 hours), none. There were a few "what the HELL just happened?" moments for me (specifically, the tree with the acorn in its mouth, the arrow stuck in a tree, and collecting the evil snail's slime).\n\nHO scenes: they are overall quite easy, but many of them follow the pattern which is seemingly more common in games from Big Fish: the items collected in such scene combine to build up the item you end up getting after the scene. (i prefer this approach over searching for many random items and keeping one of them afterwards.) Some reviewers complain about the abstract shapes of some of the HO items, but that's clearly a matter of taste. Yes, they DO make the HO scenes more difficult, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Ambiguous search terms in HO scenes are relatively common (e.g. looking for a "face" when there are at least 3 faces in the scene), but i've seen much worse.\n\nGood pacing, though, combined with nice voices and lovely scenery, make this a nice casual HOPA.\n\nGotta thumb this up.","April 16","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was recommended by a friend of when she saw me playing a similar type of game. So I try and choose this "Grim Legends" Series. I fond of this particular fairytale.\n\nThe game is well-made and such beautiful artwork/graphics. The story can be follow easily as you progress in the game. You can used a map to go to a particular area fast, although I prefer to walk along the area for clues. The puzzles are quite interesting and it sometimes provide "depth" to our character (As a healer/herbalist) and to the story. The bgm are really good make you relax and concentrate on solving the puzzle.\n\nEverything is great but the voice acting... just little bit off but you can ignore it. When you listen there will be few dialogue that are "Being READ by the voice actor" not "ACTING on it" a way.\n\nAnyway, I do recommend this for those who are into fairytales and puzzle solver. Worth for your time and mind.\n","April 21","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They can make any basic story sound interesting with good storytelling, having few plot twists, good puzzles and with really amazing background art. The pros of their games is making the most simple stories interesting and memorable but always having a high quality in their games. The cons are that these games are like Undertale; you get the most fun and delight when you don't know anything about it. Later on it's nice to replay it few times but it doesn't have the same charm anymore. But this game has something that just makes it better when you replay it few times. I played this game twice and the story made lots of more sense.\nThis game isn't sequel to earlier Grim Legends-game, the Forsaken bride; it's just an another tale and another story in distant country far away.\nThe story is quite decent for HOG game; something bad happens and player has to solve the problem and also seek the truth which lead to horrific events. Basic day. But Artifex Mundi gives live to this story with intriguing backstory which in my opinion sounded realistic.\nThe puzzles are not hard but they might take time depending, how accustomed HOG player you're.\nThe voice acting is good too, quite good for HOG game. The voices have personality and I have to admit that I still remember clearly the nasal voice of the Peacock queen and the rough and hoarse voice of the Swan king.\nThe art has personality and looks nicely rough and the background looks slightly twisted in my opinion, contrast to the bright colors and prettiness. It makes the game more memorable but also gives the feeling that the world is alive and breathing when our protagonist is on the adventure.The music also is really pretty but not something that really stays in mind.\nThere's a main game but also a bonus game but the main games story is much more well thought than the bonus. It just gave me the feeling that Artifex Mundi had to add some kind of bonus story so the CE wouldn't feel waste for the buyers. But it is still enjoyable if you don't think it too much. And personally I would have liked to that bonus was small prequel or sequel of the main story than another story in Swan queens perspective.\n\nIt's good game with basic story where you solve the mystery of mysterious events. It's one of the best Artifex Mundi games they have made for awhile and for it's high quality in art, story and possible the collectibles you can say that you haven't wasted you money in vain. If you're still thinking should you buy this use your extra money to it when you wan't to just sit down and have fun or buy it when it's on sale. This game is a good introduction on the Hidden object genre and on the Artifex Mundi games.\n\nThe pros:\n- gorgeous art\n- basic story with an twist\n- memorable voice acting\n- realistic characters\n- replay possibility\n\nThe cons:\n- needs more than one play through to enjoy properly\n- slightly linear story\n- predictable\n\n","February 11","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
