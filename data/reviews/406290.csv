"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drengy/recommended/406290/","drengy","drengy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drengy/","150 products in account","Twilight Struggle is widely considered to be one of the best boardgames of the last decade (it’s ranked #2 on the Board Game Geek website) and this software version absolutely does it justice. Follow the tutorial, then play a game or two and you'll find the interface to be very intuitive, allowing you to easily examine your cards, test each play option, and execute your decision quickly. Watch the video above to get a good feeling for how things work.\n\nMultiplayer is asynchronous, allowing you to create games with various chess clock time limits from 30 minutes all the way up to 45 days, for those who want to play just one move per day. There’s a chat function in both the multiplayer lobby and each game. The friends list is not connected to Steam, but specific to your Playdek account, which is required for multiplayer and shared amongst all their games. If you’ve ever played Ascension, Agricola, or any of the other Playdek iOS games you can use the same account. Rankings use the standard ELO system.\n\nSingleplayer is still a work in progress in the initial release: it's a challenge for less-experienced players, but not Twilight Struggle veterans. Also, expect to wait 10-20 seconds for the A.I. to take each turn. Playdek says the single player A.I. is learning from every game played, so it should get better as time goes on. Right now it's a great way to learn some strategies to improve your multiplayer play.\n\nThe game is cross-platform Mac/PC, and it'll also be cross-platform with the upcoming iOS and Android releases, so you'll be able to play other folks no matter their choice of gaming device.\n\nPlaydek has added some nice touches like audio clips of cold war era leaders and other period-appropriate sounds that help set the mood. Sound effects are easily turned off if you don't like them. You can also increase the interface speed once you know what's going on and don't need time to read the cards as they’re played.\n\nThe game interface scales well. I’ve played in on an 11” MacBook Air up to a 40” UHD desktop display and everything’s looked good.\n\nI highly recommend Twilight Struggle for both the veteran tabletop player who’s looking for more opportunities to play, and for the newbie who wants to check out one of the best boardgames there is. I’d never played Twilight Struggle before this and now I can’t stop.\n\nRating: 4.5 out of 5.  5 stars as soon as the A.I. is better and faster.","April 13","true","108.8"," 96 of 107 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","96","107","3","5"

If Europe scoring is gone, don't overfocus yourself on Europe. If you have a scoring card of a region where you are weak and you reasonably think your oppo can overwhelm you there, headline it for limiting his score.\n* Do your best for using your event cards as Operation instead of events - They'll be back in reshuffle hopefully flooding opponent hand.\n* Consider when play an oppo event - You'll have to do it, just decide when is the best moment for eliminate from the game that card minimizing the effects.\n* Consider space race an emergency option - you will not place influence but neither activate the oppo event, but it will be back sooner or later.\n\nTime after time you'll understand that there are some etabilished standards:\n* Luck and Unluck with dices and draws are almost ininfluent - you must plan a strategy simulating you'll fail premium rolls, and then enjoy every improvement. Do something "desperate" only if you have no other options. And if you have no other options, you've probably had some misplay before.\n* USSR will be aggressive and advantaged in Early War, US will be very strong in Late.\n* USSR will try to end game at +20 pts in Mid War, US will close the game in Late War or Turn 10 end scoring.\n* USSR Turn1, ActionRound 1 will be on 90% of times: Coup Iran , with a 3 or 4 op card. Generically USSR appreciate Coup every turn as 1st action to degrade and keep Defcon 2 for prohibiting USA Coups in Battlegrounds: logically USSR will avoid to have Non-Battleground cheap countries, so USA will be pressed by Lack of Military OPS.\n* You'll play for points but also a step forward - you'll spend some, if able, for take advantage for later scoring, and for later event (i.e.: USSR will "Always" be interested in Middle East due to OPEC Card effect) having a better vision of the game.\n* You'll thing about creative tactics like Coup Italy instead of Iran, if you have proper cards to Red-Color Europe; you'll understood that Thailand will be an hot place, that having Pakistan and India in the same time without having their war card in hand can be a problem, and many many many other considerations.\n* In the meanwhile have some games playing US, to see the other side of the game and have a deep, complete view of the game, and unlocking it's way to play with clear ideas.\n\nIf you are a gamer that stay on-pause thinking about what to do, Twilight Struggle will be like sitting in front of a fire tasting a good Armagnac. And you'll never have a game like the previous one.\n\nAh, don't forget to play versus human opponents during your learning curve - IA will NEVER be smart, insidious and challenging as another TS player.\n\nIf you'll be enough patient and appassionate to appreciate the game, your €/£/$ will be very well repaid.","April 19","true","13.2"," 44 of 51 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","44","51","3","2"

It's been out for ages as a boardgame, and even on pc, but this port is probably the most polished of all of them. The tutorial is great, the singleplayer is great, and the multiplayer is great. The interface makes it really easy for someone new or still learning (like me) to still perform well without having to look at the rules constantly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biz_/recommended/406290/","biz_","Biz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biz_/","234 products in account","This is an interesting 1v1 game with a pretty steep learning curve. The rules and cards aren't hard to comprehend - it's just that there are lots of them to memorize, and games are pretty long with lots to keep track of.\n\nThe games are decided by 3 things: skill (most of which is experience/memorization), card-drawing luck, and dice-rolling luck.\n\nThis game is less about strategy/simulation and more about probability-based calculation that relies on memorizing lots of events. The computer does help you see the probability distributions and visualize moves before committing to them so that finding good moves is easier. The interface is better as a result, but the actual game is still held back by being a board game.\n\nThe optimal move has little to do with analyzing the situation and making a decision based on strategy - it's about minimizing your vulnerability to predetermined events that will happen in the future based on fixed event cards.\nFor example, you have to avoid spending your moves building up a presence in Romania because there's a card that removes all your influence in Romania and gives it to your opponent. What makes Romania different from Bulgaria or Hungary? Nothing that actually matters in the gameplay rules or the map geography, and nothing that has to do with strategy or what the game is trying to simulate.\n\nThe basic problem is that the event cards are completely predetermined (seemingly inspired by actual historical events). When you make moves that seem like they should exploit a weakness or create different opportunities, the game doesn't generate new or different event cards. The game doesn't recognize that the situations which allowed those historical events to happen might not exist in your game. It's just a digital version of a board game that has hard-coded events.\n\nOnce you have memorized all those events, you can plan better and the game becomes more interesting. But there's still a huge luck component that will make the experience less rewarding and unnecessarily slow down the process of learning/improving.\n\nI'm not sure how balanced the two sides are. There are some options to handicap one of the sides, so there's probably a workaround for potential imbalance.\n\nIt was a few hours of fun, so I'll "recommend" it assuming the multiplayer works well, but the AI doesn't seem to understand how to play for victory. I might play it more if the AI gets better, but I'm not convinced that multiplayer is worth the time to really learn.\n\nThe computer version could have fixed the luck-based aspect and the hard-coded events with something better, but for matches that are as long as the ones in this game, I'd rather play something that's more skill-based. Maybe they did the best they could for a board game, but it's not the best option for a PC game that claims to be about strategy.","April 15","true","8.1"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","29","45","0","4"

That said, I cannot recommend purchasing the digital version of this game in its current incarnation.\n\nFirst, the AI is truly awful, it presents no challenge to a veteran whatsoever. If there were multiple difficulty options and this AI was ranked Very Easy then that would be fine. This AI couped the Phillipines with the China Card on the first turn... it boggles the mind. Would it really be so difficult to tell the AI to coup Iran instead? Iran is a much higher priority than the Phillipines. The AI also has a strange tendency to headline India-Pakistan War/Nuclear Test Ban on the first turn... when both India and Pakistan are empty and Defcon is at 5. A stronger AI would certainly headline something like Socialist Governments/Red Scare instead and use Nuclear Test Ban for Operations. It feels like whoever programmed the AI had no real understanding of how to play the game.\n\nNow this issue with weak AI would be fine if the online mode was good. It's much more fun to play against humans after all. Unfortunately each time I've played online my connection to the game's servers has been consistently failing every minute or two, which makes the game unplayably slow and wastes tremendous amounts of time. My connection to my ISP is fine, I can browse the web and play any other online games just fine, but for some reason Twilight Struggle just can't connect to my internet. It's hugely irritating. The fan-made version of Twilight Struggle (hosted for free on chantry-games.com) could connect to my internet but for some reason this official version cannot. A fix for this issue would make the game much better\n\nNow onto the positives. The music is great and sets the tone very well, makes me feel tense just listening to it. The visual design of the game is very appealing too and it's very easy to navigate the UI. The quotes from US and Soviet leaders at the start of each turn is a nice touch, though it would be better if it wasn't always the same quote - I'd like to hear more randomised variety.\n\nAlso, a note to GMT games, please allow chantry-games.com to continue hosting their fan made version of the game. At least until you have fixed the bugs in the online mode of this version. Arry's version is just more user-friendly, you should have employed him","May 7","false","26.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","1"

If you like history even a little bit, or strategy games at all, I would highly recommend this game.\n\n\nTwilight Struggle is an incredible game where every move feels like it could be your last, every mistake is paid for dearly, and every minor victory feels so, so rewarding. This game features a 1v1 tactical deathmatch between the US and USSR during the Cold War, and each side tries to best the other by spreading their influence throughout the world. Play is mostly card based, and each player must decide which cards to play each turn to destroy their opponent: but not all cards are helpful to you, and the threat of global nuclear warfare constantly looms over you. This is probably the most intense and fun strategy game I have played, and seeing it finally brought to Steam is a blessing.\n\nPROS:\n- One of the best startegy games ever. Not kidding. The strategic value behind this game is off the charts.\n- I find the interface to be fairly good, save for a few hiccups\n- There is a pretty good tutorial for any newcomers\n- You can play online multiplayer or offline against an AI\n- The game gives you several options for modifying the base game, if that's your style\n- Atmoshpere, music, etc. is the best I could possibly imagine it to be for a Cold War strategy game like this\n- Tons of historical references for any history nerds out there\n- Considering the physical board game version of this is usually more than $40, and THAT price is worth it, $15 is pretty damn cheap\n- Taking over the world and nuclear warfare are ALWAYS fun\n\nCONS:\n- This game has a pretty big learning curve, in my opinion. The tutorial is good, but you may have to play several games before you get the hang of things\n- I have noticed several minor glitches, usually when trying to get past a certain screen or when trying to click something, but I have found none of these to be game-ruining\n- May have to nag your friends to buy a copy if you want to play with someone you actually know\n- The AI takes a bit of time to make moves\n\nNEUTRAL:\n- Not sure if I just suck, but the AI seems to be pretty brutally difficult. Some people may like this, others not\n- This game does involve chance: picking up cards and rolling dice. Some people may like this in strategy games, other people might not\n\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game. 10/10 board game, 10/10 strategy game, 7/10 video game. You will have a lot of fun spreading freedom as Murica, and a lot of fun killing capitalist pig-dogs as the commies. Like I said, I think the asking price is not too bad.

Let us begin by saying that this whopping game is awesome. Not just oh look at the graphics or the gameplay or what not, it doesn't hold a candle there. It's a board game it will not win in animations because it does nto really have them. What it does offer is an amazing experience. You will fight your oppponent over countries ♥♥♥ for tat hoping for a better roll and you will smile while holding a hand full of your opponents cards. But only when you know the game. Before that it will seem dull, random and hard. People who know the game will destroy you in it. These are just things that happen.\n\nYet the game still feels amazing, my reported hours are low but that's just this version. The physical game has seen well over 50 plays. Some of which ended by the second turn and some which have lasted all 10. Even after all that time I still find new ways to use the cards and new ways to screw over your opponent. This version in particular makes it easier to get more plays in. The overall ui is serviceable I would say. It does its job and considering it will eventually make a mobile crossover the design choices made are understandeable. The AI is learning appparently and will get better but it will probably never beat a human opponent once you know how to play. It does a lot of mistakes (like not couping Iraq in AR1) so don't expect it to be challenging once you know the gist of what you are doing. Once you play humans though it's where it shines.\n\nthe tension of most turns is beautiful and gut wrenching. You play a card and hope they don't play another. You hope they play a card that has your event. It is the most wonderful aspect of the game and is the hallmark of brilliance. Overall I would say this is an awesome game and a good version of it to boot. It deserves all the praise it gets being #1 on BGG for over 10 years.  Play it fall in love and lose yourself to it forevermore.","April 14","true","6.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Even if you get a hand full of cards that trigger good events for your enemy, they likely have a hand of events that trigger your events, and having the optionto choose when your opponent events trigger is more powerful than it seems at first.\n\nThere is a palatable tension for both players as you try to figure out what your opponent is doing, which often leads to bluffing maneuvers and domino effects. The USSR player starts strong but weakens towards the end game. Despite this, the game is balanced well.\n\n\n\nIs this a good application??\n\nIt allows you to play Twilight Struggle online, and doesn't do anything else spectacular. There are a few UI bugs such as setting resolution while in full-screen mode, but I was not prevented from changing any options after some fiddling.\n\nThe tutorial works but misses one or two key points. Annoyingly, if you try to make an illegal move, the game won't tell you why. You have to go read the played card to figure out what you're doing wrong.\n\nThe AI is smart enough to win the game in some interesting ways, but will occasionally do some really bad/non-sensical moves. In one game vs. the AI it didn't even play a card that would automatically lose them the game if held onto. Apparently it will improve later, but for now  I wouldn't treat the AI as anything but a way to learn the game before playing online.\n\nSince there is nothing stopping you from playing Twilight Struggle on VASSAL essentially for free, the only reason to buy this is if you want to trade VASSAL's quirks for the official game (and it's quirks), nicer graphics and be able to find games easier.\n\n\nTL;DR: Read the paragraph above, recommended because the game is good.","April 18","true","15.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

What it lacks in a real physical board, it makes up with some good tension music.\n\nSome things to note that I am not a super-fan of.\n\nThe buttons are spread out all over the board, giving the menu a slightly scattered feeling. However, it kind of makes sense as you get used to it, and I presume this is to make it easier for the developers to make the game work across more platforms without changing to much.\n\nDice-rolls. Actually, I would like some kind of animation. I dont know why, and it will most likely take up time. But I would like them, since an animation would catch your eye.\n\nCards in play have their OPs value hidden. No biggie, and you can enlarge the card as well, showing the entire cardface.\n\nAI seems to provide some resitance, but most likely needs some more polish. Also, all of the setups I have done this far, the soviet AI starts the same way, perhaps the best way, but gets kind of old.\n\nUpsides.\n\nZoomable map, and regions are easily accessible using buttons.\n\nThe little guide that helps you count the likelyhood of a success of a coup for instance, and the outcomes of each die result. Not that it is super-needed, but it provides some transparency to what happens, and is most likely a good aid to new players.\n\nThe board overall, that shows what you need to know in a concentrated fashion (even if I somewhat miss the scoreboard).

I notice that most, if not all, of the negative reviews are because of bugs and I can honestly say that I've only encountered one bug in over 10 hours of play and the game fits the screen like a glove both in fullscreen and windowed mode. The AI isn't very good either but the developers are apparently gathering data from players to improve it. I'm sure that all the bugs will be dealt with in the near future.\n\nRegarding the game itself it is a 1on1 strategy/war board game where players control the USSR and the US during the Cold War. The cards that the players get to play are based on real historical events meaning that if one is a history buff it will heighten the enjoyment. It's a fairly complex game and I doubt that anyone will feel truly comfortable and confident until game four or so but that goes to show how deep and wonderful it is. Another great thing is that skill truly matters way more than luck. Sure it's possible to lose the game because of poor die rolls if it's extremely tight but usually the better player will prevail. A single game will take approximately 30-120 mins which is great because you won't be forced to dedicate a whole evening to a single game.\n\nIf you love board games then purchasing this for 15$ or less is a no-brainer.\n\n10/10 for me.","April 18","true","41.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You do that by using the cards in your hand, which reflect historical events of the Cold War such as 'the Cuban Missile Crisis', the foundation of the 'NATO', the establishment of the 'Warsaw Pact', etc. However, each card has also an associated point value that you may use to place direct influence on the countries, roll for realignments to change the influence balance in countries, or to throw a 'coup' to try to displace the enemy altogether.\n\nInfluence in the countries is key to score victory points (VPs): once you reach or surpass an influence threshold you get to control that country; control of countries reflects presence, dominance or control of a region, such as Europe, Asia, the Middle East or Africa and entitles each player to a certain ammount of VPs. But here's the thing: the scoring of regions happens through cards just as those of the events, so you never can be really sure when a certain region will be scored and must keep alert at all times.\n\nThe game has a steep learning curve at the start, since the players must get to know the cards in the deck to be prepared to face what may come. That may sound a bit appalling but it's the base of its mastery. I can only recommend this game as a matter of principle: you will like it if you like tension, unpredictability, second-guessing, and managing chaos. This is a game of starting fires that your adversary must put out while you try to put out the ones they start. It is a game of long term strategies and short term reactions. It is a game that rewards patience and resilience. It is a game that puts you under pressure and you better like it.","April 16","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The interface looks nice and animations are cool enough, although the music got a little repetitive after only a few turns.

Now it is number 2.\n\nIt is a game of Cold War brinksmanship and high strategy for two players or one player vs a pretty decent AI. You take the role of either the United States or the Soviet Union and the game begins in 1945, with the battle lines drawn between the liberal capitalist Western Europe and the Communist Eastern Europe and Asia. The goal is to use world events, coups, and political realignments to shift the governments of a region toward one bloc or the other. Controlling a region nets victory points; earning 20 victory points at any time, or having the most VPs at the end, wins you the game.\n\nIf you start Global Thermonuclear War, you lose. But sometimes there are immense temptations to walk right up to the razor's edge. It's a one-of-a-kind experience that puts you right into the ♥♥♥♥ed-up brain of a Cold War strategist, making choices that are completely logical and rational from a game theory point of view but are horrific when you stop to think about what they mean in the real world.\n\nWill you change history? Or will you be buried by it? That's up to you.\n\nThe gameplay of the original boardgame is imported basically seamlessly into this adaptation. Like the Sentinels of the Multiverse adaptation, there are a few areas where you can kind of tell this was developed to work on touchscreen devices as well as PC - lots of big buttons and dragging things into highlighted areas - but Twilight Struggle's support for the PC interface feels a little bit more robust. You CAN play cards by dragging them around the screen or you can just click them and then click the menu option for what to do with them.\n\nThe interface is polished enough for a small-scale game. It's not bare-bones. There are fun little aesthetic touches, like the tap-tap-tap of Morse code when it comes time to confirm your turn, or audio clips made from famous speeches by Stalin, Truman etc when new turns begin. Eveyrthing seems to work so far.\n\nI haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but the single-player works well. The AI isn't stupid; it's not like playing some kind of cosmic genius expert at the game, but it doesn't do obviously stupid things and it's a great way for beginners to learn the ropes. Also, the developers have apparently committed to constantly refining the AI based on the outcomes of games played out in the real world, so we can expect it to get harder and better as time goes on.","April 15","true","7.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you're willing to take some time to learn its mechanics and lose your first games, go ahead and give it a shot!\n\nI have always been a strategy game fan and the Cold War is also one of my favorite history periods, so I simply had to buy this game once I noticed it on my steam recommended games page thingie on the store.\nThis is probably the first time that thing gets it right, because I'm really enjoying this game so far!\n\nAs far as I know, this is a digital port of a classic board game which was rated by several websites as THE greatest board game of all times, I'm not competent enough in the subject to say whether it is true or not, but I can say it is indeed a good game.\nSo, what do you do in this game? You play as either the USA or the USSR, and you basically have to spread and strenghten your influence throughout the entire world by putting influence points, attempting coups, activating historical events and partecipating at the space race.\n\nThere are three kinds of cards you'll be playing with: the USA cards, the USSR cards and the neutral ones.\nDespite what you might be thinking right now, you can play EVERY card in the game, even if it is not of your side's!\nObviously, this'll lead to consequences; more precisely, the enemy card's event will be triggered if you use it, but you'll be able to use its points to do aforementioned stuff in the previous paragraph.\n\nThere are 10 turns, each turn is by itself divided into 7 rounds, and there are three periods: Early War, Mid War and Late War.\nThese periods can generally tell you who's going to prevail in each period's turns: the USSR will have a pretty huge advantage in the Early War, thanks to many event cards you'll be given whose effects are strong, the Mid War period will be even and then, in the Late War, the USA will get their good cards.\n\nI'm not going to explain ALL the rules of this game (I kind of did, there just are a few more features left to be explained, but the tutorial imo is good enough at doing so), but I'm going to tell you it is a pretty addicting game.\nThis is not a game which can be played right off the bat unfortunately, you have to get accostumed to its mechanics and see which strategies are the best for each side, but once you do get comfortable with its settings, it is really worth it.\n\n8/10","April 16","true","5.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The learning curve in terms of playing is not steep, but the strategy curve (is that a term?) is *very* steep.  What seems basic at first is in fact quite nuanced and the more you play the more you realize what a tremendously challenging battle of wits this game is.  Finally, it has that greatest sought after qualtiy of a good game, of just wanting to play one more turn, or get a re-match so you don't make the same mistake (only to make new mistakes as you learn!).

I'll break down my review into sections.\n\nThe Game Itself --\nTwilight Struggle is widely considered one of the best strategy board games of all time.  It sat at the #1 spot at BoardGameGeek for years before it recently was bumped to #2.       The game itself is dripping with theme, delving you right into the mentality of the Cold War complete with actions striaght out of the headlines.\n\nThe game is not a simple one.  The rules are fairly complex and full of "do this, unless it is Tuesday and the moon is full" and the rulebook can sometimes look like a legal document with things like "Refer to Rule 47 subsection A paragraph 3".     However, once you get over the learning curve, the game is quite in depth and rewarding.\n\nPlaydek's Implementation --\nImplementing a digital version of Twilight Struggle is quite a feat and the result is fairly impressive.   Some UI elements seem a bit disjointed (especially along the bar at the top) and the screen can tend to get a little bit busy at times, but in all the digitial implementation is faithful to the board game.    It also has the great advantage that the game itself takes care of all those niggling rules details for you and offers helpful hints and reminders along the way (for example, the game warns you when you haven't played enough MilOps this turn)\n\nThe tutorial is fantastic.   If you haven't played Twilight Struggle before (or its been a long time), the tutorial gets you through the meat of the game and brings you up to playable speed less than 20 minutes.\n\nThe AI is slooooow, but that's to be expected for a game of this complexity.   The fact that a decent AI was built at all is somewat of an impressive feat in and of itself.   However, there are times that I'd wish the computer would think a little faster.    The AI is certainly a capable player, however, it is sometimes like playing poker against the computer in that you miss out on the psychological manipulation that's inherent to the game.\n\nThe sound is one place where the game really stands out.   The music and clips of political speeches echoing in the background really adds to the ambiance of the Cold War setting.\n\nIn all I would give this game an 8 out of 10:   An excellent implementation of a venerated board game whose only detractions are a bit of UI clunkiness in places and a slow AI.","April 17","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is an amazing game of strategy, deception, and just the right amount of luck. The game is complicated, but if you play the tutorial the rules are fairly easy to pick up. I saw a few other people complaining about the AI turn length, but it's really only about 5-10 seconds. If you don't have the patience to wait that long, this probably isn't the game for you anyway. This is one of those few games I will never uninstall and will still be playing many years from now.

I rarely get to play the physical game anymore, so I've been looking forward to this version for a while. The visual/audio flourishes are a nice touch, and the UI is very clear so you always know what's happening.\n\nMy main gripe is with the AI. For any veteran of the game, the current AI is pretty much a punching bag. For example, I always give them the maximum handicap of 10 influence, and I usually end the game with Domination/Control of all regions without much effort. It's really that bad. While it's understandable that the AI has to cater towards new players, getting to play against a skillful AI was a big draw for me. I hope that Playdek gets the AI to a point where we can choose the difficulty level of solo play.\n\nOverall: Good production, but AI needs serious work.

The biggest failing is that you cannot save a game against the computer, and the board game on which this video game is based is a long game. I have yet to play all the way through before having to quit and at that point, you lose the state of your game.\n\nThe video game implementation should not let a learner like me lose the war by reducing DEFCON below 2. It should just say, "you can't do that, it would lead to thermonuclear war (DEFCON 1) and you would lose the game." Letting the players inadvertently kill themselves is always bad UI.\n\nIt's also unclear why you can't do things, even when you refer back to the manual. A popup explanation of why an action can't be taken in a region, like why a coup attempt can't be made in a particular country, would be *very* helpful to learning the game. I assume the game knows why an action is valid in a country or not... it should tell the player.","April 30","true","2.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's seriously killing my interest in Twilight Struggle.\n\nChantry was free, much better, and it cut to the chase. The UI on this game is clunky, the tabs/map has poor choice of colouring, and you can tell this game was designed for a smartphone. It's good I haven't played it fullscreen, because I've heard the buttons don't actually work when doing so. Meanwhile, the buttons themselves look ugly, bulky, and they flash at you, along with the flying headlines that fly at you every time a round ends. They have too many confirmation processes which are unnecessary, such as the DEFCON reminder. Urgh. It's like they're marketing the game to 12 year olds. Just. URGH.\n\nAdditionally, the AI is terrible. It once gave Europe to me on a platter, then instead of preventing me from having more countries, it just wasted all of its points trying to break my controlled countries. I've read two accounts now where it chooses (on its first turn, on the first round) to coup the Philippines with the China card...what even...\n\nFinally, considering they had a budget of nearly $400,000, I scratch my head to why this game only has 4 soundtracks (two of which are national anthems, they all loop every minute or less), which sound like they've been made on Guitar Pro 6? Seriously?\n\nHowever, I will state the positives;\n- I like the chance calculator for die rolls, and country counter for each continent. However, I don't even read these.\n- The Game Log.\n- The continent zoom buttons. Which I don't use either.\n- I like how it keeps your W/L record.\n\n\nNow, to speak of the online. Things the online is missing and requires;\n- You can't watch other people's games. This needs to be available.\n- You can't title the matches you create to describe what kind of game you wanna play. Infact the matchmaking interface looks fugly, and needs a rehaul; they can put it on the same page with the chatbox, for starters.\n- They need to sort out its ranking system. I thought it was neat at the start, but then I realise it's not a real ranking system, and is unbalanced (not even depending who you lose to).\n- They need a 'hardcore' mode, which doesn't tell you of which cards are redundant, which doesn't tell you that you need to hand in your scoring cards two rounds before the end of the turn, which doesn't keep a track of every card used, and which doesn't ask you to confirm every decision you make.\n- Perhaps add tournaments.","May 12","false","67.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

(BUT NOT NOW)\n\nBuy it when the price is lower than $10 and when the awful interface of this game is corrected, since the interface is highly orgaznized with redundant and complicated steps to prevent players from saying "oh I've just got a misclick! So the reason why I am losing is not because of my strategy but simple misclick"\n\n- but the real porblem is those redundant confirming steps actually cannot prevent misclick. It's 100% downgrade version of TS digital edtion you can play at wargameroom.com, since it gives player no warning -> whether this move can occur immediate lose on DEFCON, or whether was I using this card as event or actually was trying to use as ops; so the UNDO option of this digital edtion is totally full of failure. If you misclick some DEFCON suiciding card via event, there's no undo option left and there's still no warning.\n\n(I can say most of developers of this digital edition never plyaed TS often, or they are really stunning genius so they can do every single clicking action calculated in their brain to prevent misclick though they are playing 30min game)\n\n(They should place "action confirming step" BEFORE the effect of card or ops occurs. Not AFTER the effect of card occurs - especially when using cards with event on my side. Plz check for events like 5-year or CIA)\n\nAlso there's another problem that the chatting lobby is not working well; why they don't allow personal messaging? It's too broad and unaligned to give players comfortable experience to find another player.\n\nAnd one thing I can make sure is, that, there should be option for turning off in-game chatting or at least option for turing off chat from unwelcome player. I'm so sure that some day, some mad and uneducated, rude people will come in and make other players upset - And there's no strong reporting & review system against player delinquencies.\n\nThough, besides all this failure, I think owning an official online format to play TS is nice choice.

Chinese people will never forget Soviet's generous assistance, just as Chinese will never forgive Soviet's greedy claim. In the early stage of Chinese Civil War (AKA War of Liberation), Soviet suggests that CCP (Chinese Communist Party) should let KMT (Chinese Nationalist Party) take control of the northeast China. Soviet also forces CCP to stop the war, and dislodges Northeast Bureau of CCP by tanks. Because of the statements above, Mao Zedong has no affections of the big brother Soviet. On the other hand, the capricious personality and the reneged move of Stalin furtherly irritate CCP, who have just become the new leader of east Asia during the Korean War. Finally, when Khrushchev put forward the plan of "joint fleet" and "radar station, “Mao Zedong immediately denounced that “Stalin's Great Russian chauvinism is shown again.” Thus the armies of the two countries have faced off at the both sides of the border for years, and Ussuri River conflict broke out at last.

The game sort of freezes.\n\nEDIT:  Ok so I gave the game a few more tries... I still give it a thumbs down.  Here's why:\n\nThe freeze issues seem to be a buggy interface whereby the game only plays well in small window... I have a widescreen monitor running at 1920x1080.  If I put the game in this mode, the right side buttons for Asia, and the top right hand button to return to the "home" screen just don't work.  Worse, is that many areas of the map will not work and you end up clicking away.  So somehthing is buggy there.  To be fair, from experience in other games, these bugs should be easily fixed.  I'm just surprised to see this issue, a basic bug, not found by the Devs prior to launch.  So get it fixed.\n\nWhen I did play at the smaller window size, everything is of course a lot smaller so pretty hard to read.  Still I played a game.  It went 3 turns or about 18 "rounds", as there are approx. 6 rounds per turn or something like that (this is an adaptation of a board/card game so it tries to mimmick and stay true to the real game).\n\nI played as the EAST or Soviets.  I found that the PC opponent AI takes a long time to "think", and the only clue that it is thinking and not that the game froze is the small spinning icon of the eagle on the top left side, and a small text description at the top center screen.  Other than that you'd swear the game is stuck.\n\nI with there would have been a more prominent display in the middle showing AI is thinking, even an hour glass.  ANYTHING in the middle would be great.  More frustrating though is WHY is the AI taking so long.  More complex games are faster, and I have a i7 multi core PC with 32GB of RAM and there should be no reason why it takes so long for the AI to think.\n\nI found that the opponent AI was overly aggressive... see below.\n\nGAMEPLAY:  Ok so as I said I finally played as the EAST.  The first things I did was spread influence in Eastern Europe... on the first "setup" turn that is all you can do.  So I spread influence evenly with a bit more into East Germany.\n\nOnce the first turn came (after the initial setup), the WEST did a political coup in North Korea, and grabbed influence there. Oddly enough I had no influence in the setup and it doesn't even allow the EAST to do influence outside of Eastern Europe as mentioned above.\n\nThe next rounds was the same, concentration only in Eastern Europe, then a little into the Middle East.  The Cuban "card" was used and Cuba went to the EAST side as expected (oddly enough it was the WEST AI that threw this card... WHY?).  Then the WEST starts a war in Korea and LOSES, causing DEFCON to move to Defcon 3... not a good situation... the WEST starts a war, they lose and then DEFCON triggers.\n\nOnce that turn ended DEFCON moved to 4.  Phew...\n\nThen more weird stuff happens.  I begin to spread thin influence in as many countries as I can in Africa and Middle East.  The WEST throws the Pakistan-India War card.  Pakistan wins (we sided with them so we gained influence there),  DEFCON remains at 4.\n\nI add more influence to Korea, Vietnam, Haiti, and African countries... I even influence ISRAEL and have more influence there.\n\nThen the WEST does another attempt to coup Korea.  We go to DEFCON 2 although it is unsuccessful for the WEST.\n\nThe turn ends... we move to turn 3 (mind you there are several "rounds" in each turn).\n\nI decide to try a coup myself and do so in South Africa... it Fails, the DEFON goes to 1, nuclear war and the EAST loses.\n\nOK, I get that the EAST could in theory lose early on in the game, BUT what I don't get is why DEFCON should be so radical when the WEST tries and FAILS a coup.  I would think that there would be DEFCON changes if the "aggressor" wins, but the WEST was acting most aggresive, while I was playing a fairly low key EAST, just spreading light influence.\n\nAlmost all the major issues happened as a result of the WEST, Cuba, Korean War, and 2 wars in Pakistan-India, all were caused by the WEST.  Yet the WEST wins???\n\nMaybe I am missing something.  I will continue to play, and if I find that the game is better will add comments here.\n\nCONCLUSION:  game shows a few bugs, opponent AI is overly aggressive, end of game came far too quick.","April 14","false","4.0"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","32","7","22","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igorthebrave/recommended/406290/","igorthebrave","Igor, the Brave","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igorthebrave/","43 products in account","TL;DR: this game needs a bit of patching to be considered a final product but the board game is absolutely great and with a good amount of work this PC release can be as well.\n\nI recommend this release with reservations. Unless they patch it, players will get tired of the glitches really fast.\n\n=====\n\nI've been a fan of the board game since forever and it was a great surprise to see this release. The board game is fantastic, the best designed I've ever played. It's clear to me that this PC release has the potential to get many people hooked up badly.\n\nUnfortunatelly, it needs a lot of work to get there. I was hoping it was at least better executed than the old Vassal Engine we used to play TS online but in many aspects it isn't. All the problems with this game (as of 21.04.2016) are fixable. We need patches for:\n\n1. FULLSCREEN GLITCHES\nThe buttons don't work on fullscreen. Some get misplaced but others, like the "confirm action" simply don't work at all. This is absolutely shocking because it shows poor testing.\n\n2. INFORMATION PLACEMENT\nThings are badly placed on the screen. To fit everything into a notebook screen you sacrifice the ability to read the country labels (which is a problem for new players). This could've been partially solved by placing scores and logs in a way that uses the holes left by the map (e.g. both sides of the south Pacific, over the Soviet Union, south Atlantic), pretty much like the real board game does. Instead, what they did was squeeze the map between the top and bottom menu layers. Information isn't well distributed, that's what I mean. Bad design.\n\n3. SOUNDTRACK\nThe soundtrack is terrible. I used to play the real board game with the DEFCON soundtrack and the match was perfect. I was expecting something like that but unfortunatelly the soundtrack is terribly annoying. Most of the sound effects are equally poor. All the little noises at the click of every button remind us more of Farmville than of Twilight Struggle Deluxe Edition.\n\nPositive things:\n\nA. AI IS GOOD\nI've played a match as United States vs the AI and it seems to be as good as you could ask for. It (unfortunatelly) doesn't punish you very hard for mistakes but doesn't make many mistakes of its own either. That's where they must have focused most of their testing and it has paid off. Maybe playing as Soviet Union changes it a bit, the strategies are very different for both sides but my first impression is good.\n\nB. DICE OUTCOMES CALCULATED\nGreat addition. It's good to see the probabilities and outcomes of specific rolls. You'd have the trouble of calculating them anyway. Having them figured out for you gives it a nice touch.\n\nC. SIMPLE CONTROLS\nYou can play it with a mouse and nothing more. I'll probably play it on my TV (read section 2 for explanation). Can't wait for the PS4 release.","April 21","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the greatest board games of all time and it's a faithful and good translation to a computer game. The AI is better than I expected, but an experienced TS  player will be able to handle it easily. I like the tutorial for new players, but this is one of those games that looks more complicated to learn than it actually is - a few games against the computer AI should get the average strategy gamer up to speed. The card/board mechanics that the game is actually based on are as good as ever; you must manage cards representing historical events that help one side or the other, and often to make a play you have to hand your opponent an 'event' that helps his efforts. That results in a real feeling of historical progression through the cold war and creates all kinds of problems for each side as they move through the game. At 15 bucks this is an excellent value for a game that never fails to absorb me every time I play it. Hoping a lot of new players are brought into the TS fold thanks to this well-designed PC version.","April 23","true","77.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
