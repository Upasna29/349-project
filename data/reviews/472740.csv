The controls are just too clunky. It doesn't register controls instantly, sometimes it doesn't register hops at all, the fire ability thing you have does not always get thrown when you try to throw it, and you can only throw the fire in 3 directions, directly up, direclty down, or in a set position. I'm going to keep on playing this game , and if I feel it deserves a positive review, I will change this one.\n\nDefinitely not worth $9.99","May 26","false","0.7"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

At the games current state, the controls are very clunky, missed keys while jumping and throwing. the main keys are A D to move back and forth, WS to shoot up or down, SPACE jump and R for fire throwing move. All keys become somewhat unresponsive, making you stuck on clipping paths. The camera sometimes makes it really difficult to see what lies ahead but it doesn't matter because you can charge through enemies and take no damage, the only way I've died over and over is because of sticky controls and falling off a place where I should jump but cannot see due to set camera angles. If graphic mode is on beautiful or fast, it doesn’t change the character’s lack of facial definition and blurred outlines (the background becomes more defined though). This game would be good at its state if it were in Beta or Alpha but not as a full release just yet, I feel as though the $9.99 pricing is unjustifiable for the games current state, however if it were to improve with time I would like to make this review a positive one, as the concept of gameplay is enjoyable and it has potential.","May 26","false","0.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"
