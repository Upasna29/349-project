There's nothing wrong with that, but that is what this game is. Is it worth the 3 dollar price tag? For most people, probably not. My biggest problem with the game was that it was never challenging. A few rooms took a fair amount of time to beat, but they didn't test skill but were more trial and error and lucky bounces. I would also like to point out that the achievements are bugged, but that's really not going to be a problem unless you're achievement hunting.","May 9, 2015","false","1.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

My only wish is that it was longer. I had completed the game, got every achievement, star, hidden star, everything. You should make a sequel and make it longer plz. Great game tho!","April 17, 2015","true","3.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

That being said, it's also the sort of game I expect great things from. Though I would not call it great (at least not yet) I have to admit that I am enjoying it quite a bit.\n\nThe controls couldn't be simpler. Just point the curser where you wish "Goo Goo", a ball of goo, to jump to. The game even offers a trajectory trace to make things less frustrating. The walls the "Goo Goo" hits react differently. Some stick, some reflect explosively. Most do nothing. A pretty cool little game for the price, $2.99, and quite possibly the MOST deadly game I've ever played. I'm not sure it's possible to die more quickly or frequently than this game demands. This game offers dozens (if not hundreds) of tiny little puzzles to navigate the many rooms in the huge.......building? Fortunately, a detailed map is provided for a simple RMB (right mouse button.) Some puzzles are very clever, none are just so stupid you want to walk away. And I must admit on occasion I have just laughed...out...LOUD!\n\nThe first 2 bosses are possibly the easiest I've seen in gaming (once I figured out that's even what they were.) I just realized I've neglected to mention the point of this game! Well, actually the point is just to cruise, and have some laughs, but in that process you accumulate stars. Certain numbers of stars are necessary to pass through some of the "wormholes" to the other rooms. While the rooms share similarities, they also share a great numbers of original & creative surprises. Cruising is emphased by the need to return to rooms to find stars that were not noticed, or were possibly not there, on first traverse. Keys must also be found to open certain rooms.\n\nArtistically this could easily be called "the South Park" of games. Having an artistic center of such extreme simplicity, the sounds, though authentic to the style, do grow annoying. And I think I might have been happier, and certainly $0.99 richer, had I not bought the soundtrack, whatever it may be. Nothing except a clanky piano sounds much like music. As it says on the Store Page "All the sounds were made by his mouth(!!!)" Golly.\n\nUnfortunately, so far there is just about ZERO community for this game. Not enough info was even available for several days to even generate anything vaguely statistical about the achievements. I feel sure that's a situation that will change. Although, unless the DEVS provide a presence on Steam in any form at all, I could be wrong. Plays GREAT on a Mac. At this point, apparently NOT cloud supported. Each computer you have will play its own seperate game.\n\n(4jk(c))","April 18, 2015","true","2.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

If you look a various mobile game review sites a lot of them are more descriptions of what the games are than an actual opinion, other than maybe: "I guess it was fun". It is not easy to approach small games, mostly because of the simplicity that they bring. Super Goo Goo might as well have been a top tier Newgrounds Flash game or a mobile game, and no, that is not an insult.\n\nWhat first drew me to Super Goo Goo was the extremely minimalistic sales pitch. "Eh, whatever, here is the game, you just point-and-click, you'll figure it out, here we go!" And that actually tells a lot about the tone of the game and the way to approach it. It isn't a grand adventure. The developers (probably) knew that this would be just a small time waster. I completed the game 100% in a little under an hour and was only challenged in a few certain spots, but I remember overall enjoying the experience.\n\nThe game has a simple premise. You click the ball of goo, and then you drag it like a slingshot and release and then you look at that little puddle of snot fly across the screen like you were a substitute teacher in a very rough pre-school. You will do this in a small open world, made of a few dozen rooms accessed by portals. You then collect stars, and special green stars that only appears when you're close to them, and you use these stars to go through certain portals that has a star requirement. There are a good few extra gameplay elements like spikes, platforms that you can stick to, platforms you can bounce on, gravity and stuff like that. There is a mostly easy to follow map, and right from the get go the game is about exploration.\n\nI'd like to point out that the sound aspect of Super Goo Goo is made singlehandedly by one guy just saying the effects. It's all done orally and it's pretty funny, although the teleportation sound got a bit grating. It's also the same guy who made the music. It's a cute little old Midi-inspired soundtrack (if you've played "An Untitled Story", you'll know the feel), and it feels like it serves it purpose well enough.\n\nI really like the concept of a small scale open world game. One where you can get an easy overview and not feel like that it has been bloated. This might be an extreme case on the other side of the spectrum but it's nice to get some change from games like AAA sandboxes that tries to be bigger than they really are. What Super Goo Goo lacks in size and scale it delivers in genuinely great level design, mostly tight controls, and just a beautifully relaxed nature. It could have been released for free, but when you get down to just three bucks it starts to be a matter of penny-pinching in my opinion. Even if the game was terrible (which it wasn't) the only real reaction it will get from me would be: "Well, it was three bucks, I'll manage." But since it was actually a good game that gave me entertainment I think the three small bucks is well-given out. People pay five times as much to go to the cinema, getting entertained for 1-3 hours and then those fifteen bucks are gone. I can play this game as much as I want. If anything I'm just happy that those three bucks I gave is now in the hands of people I can trust to make a fine product, and that is just as much as big as a satisfaction as playing the game itself. Take a look at the screenshots and the description. Does an hour of dragging and shooting some goo through a small open world, finding stars, some tricky, some not sound like fun? If it does, pick it up and maybe you'll be amused for an hour too. And maybe you'll feel the satisfaction of supporting and advertising for Dumb and Fat Games since they (judging by the company name, Steam page, and overall quietness) refuse to do it themselves.","May 14, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The sound effects they have are pretty annoying, and the sound when you click the mouse sounds like some hocking a spit wad up. The map is super hard to navigate, and I got lost even though they give a map.  If you like childish, boring, and repetitive mobile games, then this one is for you, I guess. No need to get this unless you want to waste 3 dollars on a game that should be FREE.","April 16, 2015","false","0.5"," 16 of 35 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","16","35","0","2"
