You will solve puzzles by dragging around mirrors or laser-tubes, in order to lead lasers to their corresponding mechanical flowers.\n\nThe whole game has different environments, while the puzzle elements are hovering in front of you. Can't quite figure out what to do next? Look up, see a big translucent whale flying in the sky. Relax, listen to the great soundtrack. Then step back to see all puzzle elements, right there in front of you. Aha! Got it! Drag this tube there, that mirror there and voilá: Puzzle solved!\n\nThis game even ships with a level editor, which the developer used to create the actual levels. You've got full control to build whatever puzzle you can imagine! The editor is not yet finished and the developer wants to make it more accessible in the future, even add easy sharing of puzzles. But after some trial and error, you will get the hang of it.\n\nIt still feels a little edgy in the menus, but hey: It's VR, this whole platform is still in the early stages of development. I'm sure we will see improvements on that.\n\nOverall: I recommend this game, because it is a fun and rewarding puzzler, with a very relaxing atmosphere.","April 6","true","0.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

There is a really interesting balance between meditative game play and challenging puzzles that surround you as a player. I've been using a standard controller, but I'm really excited to try this when my Vive gets here and use those controllers too - either way, the game is a really beautiful, calming experience with unique challenges. Highly recommend!","April 6","true","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Its slow paced and really sets the mood with nice music and gorgeous environments. You'll have ample opportunity to just look around you and enjoy being in this world.\n\nAt heart Carpe lucem is a Puzzle game. You drag different type of objects through the world with your hands to get one or more light rays to metalic flowers. Sounds simple enough, but it forces you to think out of the box. It plays well with being a vr game, arranging the puzzle around you to make full use of vr and it works great!\n\nI played in room scale, which I always enjoy, but as the puzzles are basically in a cylinder around you I'm sure they work just as well sitting down.\n","April 6","true","1.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Thanks to the peacefully pace even people whom never wore VR goggles won't be overwhelmed with hectic movements or eye straining effects.\nThe game world looks fantastic, in all three worlds are so many things to discover. The puzzles seem to be really simple in the beginning but getting challenging and exciting real quick.\n\nSeriously props to the devs. I had a lot fun!","April 9","true","3.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You basically drag and drop objects to direct the flow of different coloured energy beams. You have to alter the colour of the beams to solve the puzzles. The default mode in Seize the Light does not rush you. The game forces you to think outside the box almost from the beginning. I like it a lot.","April 22","true","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game stands out from all of the many new VR titles. It is a relaxing, beautiful 3D puzzle game with nice NewAge music, which is only possible in VR. A good sense of space, a lot of fun tinkering and imagination are needed to run through all the lovingly created levels. Now I know why this game is nominated for German Computer Game Award ;-)\n\nHighly recommended.\n\n---------------------------------\nGerman version:\n\nWow! Dieses Spiel hebt sich von all den vielen neuen VR-Titeln besonders ab. Wirklich mal was anderes. Es ist ein entspannendes, wunderschönes 3D Knobelspiel mit beruhigender NewAge-Musik, wie es so eigentlich nur mit VR Spaß macht und funktioniert. Ein gutes Raumgefühl, viel Spaß am Tüfteln und Phantasie sind gefragt, um all die liebevoll erstellten Level durchzuspielen. Dieses Spiel ist nicht umsonst für den Deutschen Computerspielpreis nominiert worden. Ich weiß jetzt warum ;-)\nSehr empfehlenswert, sollte in keiner Sammlung fehlen! Und bei den paar Euronen macht man da eh absolut keinen Fehler.","April 6","true","2.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This VR game puts no pressure on you(no fail condition), the player can just take his time and solve simple but interesting puzzles. I can assume the game will evolve more complicated puzzles, for now it works very well with its slower difficulty slope.\n\nAlso I like the idea of "guiding the light", the effect looks interesting in the HMD stereoscopic environment. I definitely recommend this one, it can get very addictive :), because you get very comfortable with its environment.","April 7","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played it with a Vive. It has a really pleasing, calm environment and I like this kind of aesthetic. The mechanics are based on some classic concepts but feel fresh through the presentation. The elements are wrapped around your position and a part of the fun is getting it all together while seeing only a portion of it. For example fiddling with a Mirror behind your back while looking to the other side where it should land is a really new gaming experience and helps rooting your presence in the virtual world.\n\nThe difficulty is moderate with a steady progression and new elements every handful of levels. The length of the game depends on your puzzle solution capabilities but I was through after about 1.5 hours. This is on par with most of the other VR Titles out there and really keeps me longing for more content so I loved seeing that an editor (a first draft of it) is included. It's a little bit crude but not as bad as the ingame warning make it sound like. I got the hang of it after about 5-10 minutes.\n\nI can't wait for the day that you can put your levels online and get some from other people. This is teased inside of the game and I hope it will materialize soon. Also this will give you more bang for your buck but I got my money's worth even as it is right now.\n\nSo to conclude, if you have a knack for puzzle games and have a Vive, get this!","May 3","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You should check it out, too!\nFirst time I actually tried this VR-Puzzle was on 'A MAZE 2016' in Berlin. Now I have an own copy. I have seen a few VR projects now and I have got to say: among those, Carpe Lucem is one of the best. (my personal opinion, obviously)\nWhy? 3 reasons:\n\n1) Carpe Lucem is an interactive thing. There are a number of VR projects which are pure VR-experiences. Scenes you can watch and thereby admire the VR-space. They do it very well within the scope they have. Carpe Lucem does also, AND it is an interactive puzzle utilizing controllers and movable objects.\n\n2) Carpe Lucem concentrates on the elements VR is (currently) best at and wisely misses out on mechanics which are more problematic than really cool. What do I mean? The Puzzle concentrates on visuals. The environment is nice. The feel of space is good. The objects in the Puzzle are nice to look at (even with custom controller models worth admiring before even starting to puzzle). And Carpe Lucem does not even try introducing player locomotion, knowing that this is what makes most users uncomfortable, and more often a problem than a cool feature.\n\n3) The Puzzle actually makes very good use of the space and spacial awareness VR is meant to create. So the puzzles happen in 3D space (obviously, duuh?!?...). Positioning objects, aligning them towards each other, twisting, turning, shifting them. Carpe Lucem feels so natural and precise with all this (excepting 'game mechanical limitations' here, like non-rotationable puzzle-parts), just the way a proper VR-experience should.\n\nI like it a lot! From my side: 8 out of 10\n\ncheck it out!\ncheers!","May 11","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Beautiful environments and very relaxed gameplay. The difficulty ramps up nicely and new puzzle elements are introduced at a steady rate. I hope there will be an online level editor following to share the created levels. Making levels in VR can be as much fun as solving them! Only little flaw I found was the options menu, everything else is perfectly optimized for tracked controllers! Get it if you like spacial and logical puzzles!","April 27","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Smooth experience using the Vive, comfortable - not tiring at all, 0 sickness from it. Classic puzzle idea put into 3D space. I felt this worked well, regardless of how short/long the game is, I felt it was worth the $15. Considering some of the VR games I've triedat this price or higher, I'm very happy with this. Of course more puzzles added to it would always be welcome to get more bang for your buck, but I wouldn't pass this game up if you have a Vive and like this type of puzzle gameplay.","June 5","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
