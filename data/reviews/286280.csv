So far, the realism and AI seem pretty top notch. In addition, exterior graphics such as tank models are very nicely modeled. Finally, the fact that this game features somewhat functional 3d tank interiors automatically puts this title above any other modern tank sims, that is of course because we haven't seen any interior tank models since Operation Flashpoint! (correct me if I'm wrong) Drawbacks? The interface navigation is a bit confusing and takes some getting used to. In addition, graphically the 3d interior models and land environment seem a bit dated to today's standards. Evidently, this game is not categorized as early access, but probably SHOULD be as it doesn't really feel like a finished product. Otherwise, if you like obscure vintage tanks in long forgotten conflict zones, (which I totally do!) this sim's for you!","March 5, 2015","true","7.0"," 92 of 108 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","92","108","3","6"

Bought the Steam version in order to place this review and to support the developer.\n\nMake no mistake this game is not easy to learn, there are literally hundreds of controls and commands to master, i still find myself referring to the manual mid game, however your efforts will be rewarded. The UI too is a little counter intuitive, it really takes some time getting to grips with it but once you understand it it makes sense. The tutorial is not great either, next to useless in fact but there are players around who can assist you and videos, wikis etc that will shed more light on things if you care to seek them out.\n\nThis game doubles as both a realistic Tank simulator and a Platoon level strategy sandbox, you get to design scenarios, deploy your units, set up your tactics and command your men from the comfort of a beautifully modelled tank.\n\nYou can occupy any of the tank crew positions, driver, gunner, commander or loader and switch between them, the interiors are beautifully and accurately modelled and no other game manages to recreate the sense of claustrophobia, the feelings of immense power and terrible vulnerability as experienced by real tank crews, in my humble opinion.\n\nThere are only two playable tanks but they have been modelled to an exceptionally high standard, it's a case of quality over quantity, the maps too are beautiful with great lighting and weather effects that really succeed in creating a believeable and atmospheric battlefield experience.\n\nRealism is key to this game, ballistics are accurately modelled, as is the damage (or lack of it), shoot the wrong kind of round or even the right kind at a 45 degree thick armour plate and it'll glance off harmlessly into the sky, hit a weak spot square on with armour piercing and bingo! satisfying penetration, the game will accurately calculate whether or not the systems, munitions, fuel tanks or crew etc get damaged or are destroyed. After the fight you can review all the hits and any damage caused.\n\nTactics matter, the way you manoeuvre matters, unit positioning matters, coordinating your forces well will pay dividends and poor decisions are ruthlessly punished.\n\nIn a nutshell - this is a labour of love made by a developer that is passionate about armoured warfare and it shows, get through the tricky first few hours and you'll see just what a great tank sim this is. If you don't mind a steep learning curve and are up for a challenge this game will pay you back in spades.","September 10, 2015","true","2.4"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","51","53","3","4"

I am biased.   But I am going to give a bit O brutal review.  Not really that brutal.\n\n1st off.  This is a "remastered" SABOW that was released back in 2011.  It had a borked release with publishers that where borderline stupid.  The game was released in a state with game braking bugs.  This had nothing to do with the dev.  In fact they released a series of unofficial patches to fix the issues.  They however, where not allowed to officially fix the game.   However, the rights just returned to the dev's.  Where all that unofficial content was made official and many fixes and improvements where added in.\n\nThere are 2 choices for realistic tank games out there that are newish.  This being one and the other being Steel Beasts Pro.  Both have their ups and downs.  But this one is a lot cheaper.  And frankly its campaign  system is better than SBpro.  Both are most certainly worth owning for a tread head.\n\nThe vehicle models have always been a strong point in this game.  And they have aged quite well.  They looked good 4 years ago and still look pretty darn good.  The textures for the interiors of models have been improved and are ok.  But they do not look as good as they could be by 2015 standards.  But they are better than they where on the 2011 release.\n\nSome aspects have not aged super well.  Buildings and some trees/bushes are showing their age.  Not going to suger coat that.  But they do the job.   I guess as a side bonus it means it will run well enough on older vid cards =)\n\nThe campaign's are pretty dynamic.  they never play out the same way twice.  In them you have the option usually (campaign depending) of letting the ai control none playable tanks or taking that on yourself and ordering every friendly unit around on the map.  Which I totally LOVE.  Boss guys around, call in arty strikes, air strikes, and fight your tank.\n\nYou have realistic ballistics.  Realistic damage model.  Realistic shell types with realistic effects.  the more important components of the tank you can interact with the mouse.  Set angle for the gun when on slopes with the level gauge.  On the M60a1 use the realistically modeled coincidence range finder and mechanical ballistic computer.  However, for some reason you do not have player control over lights, the near infrared search lights, and unlike a previous game from Graviteam, you can not stall out your tank if in the wrong gear as driver.  I miss that.  =(\n\n\n\n\nIf your a tanker at heart...or in my case a Cav Scout out to pasture I do recommend.\n\nI like this game to much....  It like being on some sort of retro FTX without the bad cold bad food, little sleep, being filthy, and endless maintance issues.\n\n\nEdit... Oct. 2015\n\nSince this review things have changed for the better.  Now you have training missions to ease into your tank commander role.  You now do have control over lights, a choice of manual gear shifting and engine throttlle settings.  This last means you can drive stupid and stall the tank, throw a track, or over heat the engine.  Which is a nifty optional feature.  Tank interior has been greatly improved since I wrote this review.  And it looks like some bushes look better now.  The T62 can now lay smoke screens!  I was, ya that's nice.  After using such I use it quite alot to stay alive now.\n\nThe Basra 86 DLC is pretty excellant as well.  Great map!  Looks sort of like places I have been too in the mid east.  While I of course never went to where this battle took place, I did get to around out skirts of Basra.  What more can I say about that?\n\nLast thought.  This sim is pretty much what it always should have been now.   There are some rough edges and there is larger than normal learning curve, but crap, its a legit tank sim in the old school sence.  You want real without taking a heat round and having your clothes set on fire with massive flashburns, this is for you.","March 7, 2015","true","253.6"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","55","60","3","3"

Starting with the modest T-72 Balkans on Fire, then the WW2 classic Steel Fury;Kharkov 1942 and now Steel Armor Blaze of War. The campaign theaters are unique as are the main combatants, the M60a1 and T-62. I'm most impressed by the M60a1 in SABoW, a tank that was the backbone of the U.S. ARMY for over three decades. It is well modeled and detailed in this simulator. Graviteams unique blend of an armored simulator coupled with their award winning tactical simulator engine from Actung Panzer: Operation Star gives the player the options to control as much or as little of the battlefield they wish. No matter how you play your rarely if ever going to experiance the same outcome twice. The Tactic's part of SABoW is not super easy to learn but not impossible and believe me if you take the time to learn it your experiance with SABoW will be nothing short of amazing that a game can have this much depth. Even if the tactics part of SABoW isn't your thing, SABoW still offers much even if you prefer to keep it lite, the QMB will give you hours of playability alone. Just a closing note, my hours playing SABoW here on STEAM is not much but I have owned SABoW since 2011 when the publisher was UIG. I can tell you now that since Graviteam has reaquired the rights to SABoW it is a much better game, so much better that when Graviteam put it up here on STEAM I repurchased it, it's that good.","March 6, 2015","true","24.6"," 59 of 68 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","59","68","0","0"

I suggest it for people that want a hardcore game and that do not shy away from spending some hours into getting used to the game and its interface. I do not recommend it for people that just want to drive around blowing stuff up, because the realistic engagement ranges and punishing difficulty make this kind of playstyle very hard to achieve.\n\nPro:\n-Detailed simulation of vehicular warfare\n-Detailed and realistic maps, vehicles, driving and damage physics\n-Lots of control over your AI squad or own tanks crew in either direct commander mode or through the map interface\n-Dynamic campaign, giving plenty of replayability\n-Customizable difficulty and realism levels\n-Detailed Encyclopedia of the game content and its properties\n\nMids:\n-Decent messagebox tutorial that can be turned on or off with an interface button\n-Graphics are aged, but still detailled. Texture quality has suffered somewhat though\n-Slow paced gameplay is rewarded, because your tank is quite fragile when hit with anti tank weaponry\n-After Action Reports give a detailed view what hit a tank, from where and what damage has been done, allowing for improving ones playstyle in the future\n\nCons:\n-Very hard to learn controls, due to somewhat unintuitive keyboard shortcuts/layout\n-Interface is a bit cluttered to allow every action to be done with the mouse\n-Hard to learn game, steep learning curve and very punishing in case of strategic or tactical failure\n-Texture quality is considered low now and makes some assets unpleasant to look at\n-Eyestrain might be caused by using the rangefinder that overlays two images to the player. You have to find the non-blurry version of the object you want to shoot at to dial in the correct range (gunning/rangefinding can be done by the AI though)\n\nSome more detailed comments:\nSteel Armor: Blaze of War is a game that has been out for quite some time. It was released late 2011 and unfortunately had a rough launch with lots of dispute between the developer and publisher. Now that these things have been moved to the past, the developer has aquired the rights back to his own game and implemented all the fixes that they have been released so far inofficially as the official new version of the game in hope to be able to support and release more content, now that they own their IP.","March 8, 2015","true","2.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/M0rdresh/recommended/286280/","M0rdresh","M0rdresh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/M0rdresh/","119 products in account","This is an excellent tank simulation game, easily among the best available. It is not to be mistaken with any tank action game of any sort, so don't expect arcade gameplay. This game is about learning how to operate (either as commander, driver, gunner or loader) an American M60A1 and  a Russian T-62 main battle tank, both cold war era machinery. The developers practically crawled into both of these I've been told, this in order to create the cockpit and internal layout as accurate as possible, this is the real deal.\n\nThe cockpit or inside experience of these tanks are no small part in this game. Every little detail is present and the crew is fully represented and accurately animated. When firing a short you can witness the loader to pickup another around of ammunition and load it up the cannon. You can easily switch roles are you see fit, playing the gunner for example and receiving orders from the A.I. commander on your targets, distance and whatnot. Very impressive.\n\nAs an interesting addition the developers decided to also implement an operational part to the game, elements they carried over from their excellent Graviteam Operation Star strategy game. Here you can command platoons of tanks, infantry and motorized vehicles. So while operating your tank commanding your, excellent graphically represented, crew to battle victory, you can also issue orders and command an entire tank platoon. This by way of communicating orders and/or tactical map of the entire battlefield.\n\nThe Ukrainian developers have pored a lot of love into this one and it does show. Like I said earlier, this is really for the simulation loving crowd, not the 'World of Tank' player seeking instant action. This game requires thought, learning and researching, but offers a virtual dive into how it must have felt to operate these metal beasts...","March 26, 2015","true","6.3"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

The graphics are a bit dated and so is the audio but other then that its pretty good for being what it is. From what i have seen so far the unit/squad control is some what similar to the Arma series bit way more in depth and allows you to operate tank platoons with Infantry support, you can operate all stations of the tank (not sure about the loader) . my only issue is that the game has quite a bit of a learning curve, I'm unfamiliar with the series but considering this game was put onto steam i figured why not, i like tanks and it has tanks. Also the UI is kinda annoying, its better then the DCS ground units but its still i had to look up the controls to hop into a tank. The ballistics in the game seen pretty realistic, you could compare it to Warthunder Ground Forces but having as much detail inside the tank as the outside, i am not sure if the armor of the tanks are similar to WT as in modules instead of numbers like WOT. So far as where the game stands i give it a 8/10. Main reason is that it seems like they have bumped up the price tag, someone told me you could have got this game for about $5 before it went to steam, i did look around and could not confirm that so do not let that stop you from trying it out.","March 7, 2015","true","8.9"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","0"

That is a bit of a misconception.  Yes there are only the T-62 and M60A1 to be driven and operated... BUT in most battles you are a part of a tank squad, platoon, company or all three, therefore you are able to interchange between multiple numbers of M60A1s and T-62s.  You are also able to give orders to Infantry, APCs, other tank variations like the T-55, Chieftain, and Olifant, Aircraft and other units via the Tactical Map.  If you've played Graviteam Tactics, it's basically the exact same thing, so really this game could be seen as an add-on to Graviteam Tactics, or Graviteam Tactics could be seen as an add-on to Steel Armor... I'm not really sure which came first.  But yes, you can only control the T-62 and the M60A1 but that is no where near the only unit in the game.\n\nThe settings are a bit odd... Afghanastan 1979-1989.  Iran 1980-1988.  Angola 1975-2002.  Most of those areas are not your typical, main stream maps, but once you get into one of the tanks you won't really care.\n\nYou could also say that it's not as fun as a World War 2 tank sim would be, and as I would mostly agree with you, the tanks involved in this game are not so advanced as to take away what made WWII an interesting and challenging fight.  There are no radar guided missiles, lazer beams, etc.  It's still hardcore and fairly straightforward basic combat reminiscent of the battles of WWII.","September 15, 2015","true","32.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

I think it deserves every single cent, and is probably the most detailed post WWII tank simulator that everyone can reach and afford (who manages to get their hands on a copy of Steel Beasts anyway.)\n\nThe attention to detail in this game is great, both in the tactics phase and in the real battle phase. Supply, fuel, ammo and fatigue levels, weapon and armor characteristics are simulated quite nicely in the tactics phase. But even if you don't care for commanding platoons and you're just playing the game to simply hang out in a tank, the fact that this game has 3d interiors is enough of a reason to buy it for armor enthusiasts.\nAttention to detail results in a quite unforgiving game especially in terms of vision and damage; more often than not, battles consist of scanning for enemies than actually shooting at them. This may feel underwhelming for Rambo wannabes seeking to crash tanks into helos and stuff. When things get hot, though, the sound of rounds ricocheting off your armor alone is enough to force you into a fetal position, covering your ears.\n\nThe 3 campaigns that are in game do a good job of representing the common types of warfare: Inf vs Armor, Armor vs Armor, Combined Arms vs Combined Arms. Note that the attention to detail is true for the campaigns, too. They aren't story driven, so they aren't necessarily supposed to be won if you follow a path or something. Sometimes you seal your fate in the 3rd turn with a less-than-optimal move, and you don't realize it until the 6th turn when the enemy crushes you utterly.\n\nThat might be just me, but the graphics look better than it did on the non-Steam version. Yes, it shows age, but it is still on par with ArmA 2 which should be more than enough if it is a simulation you're looking for.\n\nIt should be noted that the game does leave some things to be desired.\nFirst of all, the game doesn't make a serious attempt to, I don't know, be learned? And I'm not talking about the difficulty or complexity level here. The tutorials (which AFAIK simply didn't exist as separate levels in the non-Steam version), while nice additions, are far from adequately polished. Failure to read one sentence of essential info when it appears on screen can force you to restart the whole tutorial level, as the game offers you no easy way of going back to previous messages.\n\nOptimization seems to be a slight issue. I have no problem getting a constant 55-60 FPS like 90% of the time. But especially when moving in a column with other tanks, the dust kicked up by their treads cause the FPS to dip all the way down to 20-25. This is not a game-breaking performance failure though; you simply can't see and shoot through that dust and smoke anyway, so the lowered FPS doesn't impair your aiming, it just slightly annoys you for a few seconds until the dust settles.\n\nThe menus kind of feel more clunky than the actual gameplay, and you would have thought that driving a 40-ton tank would feel clunky. Sometimes pressing the buttons doesn't really do anything; you have to go for that sweet spot that's like, not in the middle of the button and also not on the edge of it or something. You will figure it out.\n\nAlso, currently it seems like you can't assign more than one button for an action. And I haven't yet managed to get this game to change the control scheme or detect my gamepad, but that might just be the inability on my part. (I appreciate all suggestions)\n\nLong story short, SABOW is an essential part of any simulation collection. As in any military sim, it is an acquired taste. Learn to enjoy its strong points and ignore its weak ones, and you have a game you will keep coming back for more. Also, just look at that abbreviation.\n\nSABOW!

You play the role of a battallion commander using a tank as a command vehicle.  As a result, there is no floating camera to move around the battlefield and you only directly participate in a battle if you can actually enter a tank in that battle.\n\nDuring battle, you can take the position of any member of a tank crew while communicating with the rest of the crew as each member performs his functions.  You will have to command your troops from the commander's station of your tank, with not much more than your map, binoculars, tank optics and radio.\n\nEach battle happens organically throughout each historically accurate campaign and can involve anywhere from a couple of sqauds to hundreds of units.  Combined arms plays an important role.  There are heavy and light armored vehicles, air units, anti-armor and anti-air units, heavy and light machine guns, artillery, mortars and various kinds of infantry.\n\nIf you enjoy GTOS, this game uses many of the same mechanics.  It's a great buy for GTOS fans because it brings you to the first-person level for battles, creating new challenges and a different kind of immersion.\n\nLike other Graviteam titles, this game is dificult to learn but rewarding.  The included training missions are a big help.\n\nBuy this if you are a fan of historical war simulations that emphasize meticulously realistic mechanics, especially if you enjoy GTOS.","August 26, 2015","true","100.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Nonetheless cockpits provide some good immersion.\n\nCampaigns in the game are about capturing victory points on a large map, where combat encounters are being generated on the fly depending on the situation. Both you and the enemy have limited pool of units and reinforcements, attrition, fuel and ammo running out play a large role in the ultimate outcome. Altogether this means that no playthrough is ever the same. Plus as a nice touch every destroyed vehicle and killed infantry stays on the map permanently, across every encounter in that area.\n\nThere is also a Quick Battle generator, where it is fast and easy to set up whatever combat encounter you want, with any mix of forces, on any map area, controlled by you or an AI ally.\n\nIn Cold War era depicted in the game tank crews are not as blind as they were during WW2, while still not having all the tools that make tanks such an effective weapon platforms they are today. Night vision devices are passive, low res, and have to be supported by IR spotlights, otherwise there's little you can see at night. Coincidence rangefinders require constant manual control and thus the shot requires a lot more time to be perfectly lined up. Gun stabilization is only in its infancy so a lot more skill is required from gunners to land a hit. As a result all of this provides for some tight combat, not present in other, more modern tank simulations.\n\nThe game has some downsides of course. Interface is quite bad and does not feature even half the commands that keyboard shortcuts let you access. Tutorials do not exist, apart from pop ups describing what a given button does. There are still minor bugs and pathfinding in cluttered areas is wonky.\n\nDespite all of these issues - it is one of the best tank sims out there.","March 2","true","21.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","8"

If you like simulation BUY THIS, if you like tanks BUY THIS simulator now!\nHIGHLY RECOMMEDED!\n__________________________\n\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this simulator. The immersion factor is 10/10, from the rain, to the vegetation, to the light and people around you. To how they act and how the war is waged in this simulator.\n\nVery few games or simulators can make me feel like I'm there, this did. The African vegetation is spot on, and the lighting coupled with the trees and grass immerses you to no end. It makes you feel like you are a tiny battalion of tanks lost in nowhere, and the sight of a village is both a great thing and bad, as it may mean more fighting. May mean fighting? Yes, because the missions are dynamic, based on a dynamic campaign. So no mission is alike, and giving you a replayability like no other!\n\nThe dynamic campaign is really deep and interesting, and you can also choose to ignore it if you so like. The controls are intuitive and it has a nice UI in case you feel lost with buttons.\n\nEverything is nicely explained, and including the training missions. Which is what I suggest you do before you venture any deeper. Even the campaign has tooltips and explaining what you can do.\n\nI would also like to make a special mention to the incredible engine they have here. The mud, terrain deformation, and even small rivers and banks. For example, if a tank crosses a small creek, and with it lowering the terrain further, which will cause the tank behind you to be unable to cross. This is because the small crossing ended up damaged by your tanks track.\n\nAmazing details like that make one hell of a difference in anything!\n\nI also would like to mention how interesting it is the repairing mechanic, watching your crew repair your tank, to the ballistics simulation and how even small details are modelled. Like when it rains, your tank gets shiny and wet.\n\n\nThe developers are very friendly, and they answer all questions, especially on their own forums. They are still updating this gem, and there is a patch almost every month.\nThis simulator is simply amazing. Sure, there are a few bugs, but they are getting fixed, and if you find one and report to them, on their forums they will fix it faster: http://graviteam.com/forum/index.php?board=11.0\n","June 11, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The manual is quite a bit of help, so find it on the steam page/google and look through it. There is also a demo! It's not on steam, so search it up on google if you're indecisive after reading reviews and watching gameplay. It's what sold me on the game. I've by no means mastered the game at this time, still discovering new things.\n\nThe combat itself is very entertaining and intense.The effects work and detail throughout adds a lot to the game. From the sounds of your tank being hit, to the sounds of your crew when you hit the enemy. It's very well done. The first time I got hit fatally and my crew bailed I was blown away and a bit shocked. One man ran around burning to death, the other dropped dead outside on top of my broken tread, and one was slowly crawling away.  Another tank crew ran in front of my tank into a shell hole and got obliterated by an enemy hit.\n\nA bunch of different locations, time of day, weather, etc. Coming from Warthunder this is what I was looking for. It may seem intimidating, but once you read the manual/quick start guide (Google for that, its on the forum) and explore the UI a bit it becomes less intimidating pretty quickly.\n\nI haven't picked up Steel Armor: Basra 86 yet.","October 2, 2015","true","12.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Very poor tutorials. No interactive instructions, no manuals, just some pop-up texts and I know nothing to do.\n2. Programe is not stable. While I am trying to read the pop-up-text tutorials, and do what it tells me to do, nothing works. And last time I play this, everything works. I don't know why.\n3. Very miserable and confusing UI design. It's like back to the 90s and I'm playing some HD dos games.\n4. Not very well optimized graphics. It makes GTX 970 howling while the fps only reachs to 40.\n\nDespite the lack of reference manuals and poor UI design and programe bugs which drive me crazy, this is the best Cold War tanks simulator as far as I can see.","May 30","false","22.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Normally, this comes with steep learning curve and requires some skills and thinking when driving tanks. Everything on the battlefield can disable your vehicles, even infantry if you are not careful. Coming from playing WoT and Armored Warfare, I really appreciate the amount of details and features implemented in Steel Armor. Non penetration shots can also cause significant damages to your vehicles. In some scenarios, my tanks got knocked out just because of non penetration rounds. They normally damage gun barrel, ammo rack, injure crew or just plain detrack the tank.\nPros:           Cold war era game with authentic feels.\n\nVery detailed interior for two main models.\n\nGood sound effect.\n\nUnique combination between sim and wargame genres.\n\nRealistic take on night fighting with various early night visions of both sides during the Cold War. It's been great to  see vehicles litting up the dark night.\n\nCons: A.I is wonky at times, doesn't prove to be a big deal.\n\nCould be confusing to newcomers, especially players who are not hardcore sim enthusiasts.\n\nLimited playable vehicles for a sim game. I hope in the future, Graviteams will keep adding DLCs and patches that give us more stuff to play with. I won't complain if we even have different theatres for campaigns like the Yom Kippur war, Kosovo, Pakistani-Indian conflicts, etc.","December 26, 2015","true","42.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics looked (very!) good and gameplay appeared quite promising (hence all the good reviews).\nBut I really struggled with constantly hearing russian crew voices in American, Iranian and Iraqi tanks. This instantly killed any immersion.\nAsking the devs for any hope on improving this issue, they got rude on me and replied insulting bs.\nThe bottom line is, these devs are too incompetent to hire voice actors over the internet, probably not even have heard of this option.\nCheck this thread and judge by yourself:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/286280/discussions/0/620712364037830281/\n\nAfter this, I happily invoked a refund. Thanks to steam, I got my money back.\nThis actually demonstrates what refunds are also good for: to have a voice against devs who rather see you as a cashcow than a customer.\n\nSadly, the game easily could gain so much potential, if it was left to some competent developers to implement American, Arabic and Farsi voice acting and of course - Multiplayer!, which shamefully also isn't existent.\n\nTherefore I can nothing but downvote this.\n","January 30","false","2.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","1"

There are only 2 tutorials in which a novice to the game doesn't find himself under fire from very live enemies within minutes of starting the mission. The controls are very badly explained, and very few of them are covered before the battle begins, at which point it's frankly hopeless to expect a novice like myself to be paying attention to the few and far between text tips if I want to survive for even a minute or two. Add to this the fact that many of the keys the player is instructed to press are simply the wrong ones, and you're left with a bloody mess of an experience I'm afraid.\n\n\nThough ~3 times as expensive, I wish I'd gotten Steel Beasts instead. At least that game has an understandable, useful UI and is easier to get a grasp of.\n\n\nEdit: Having delved deeper into this product, I can safely say that it is simply a pathetic excuse for an arcade game, let alone a simulator. For everything that generates a positive experience, there will be a dozen equally large factors that results in nothing else than an unrealistic, buggy, badly designed awful gameplay experience. The devs have demonstrated lacking a fundamental understanding of how SABOT ammunition works, of how to produce an acceptable AI pathfinding, a realistic campaign, crew/unit management, etc. Add to this your average Eastern block "nationalistic" take on Soviet tanks, and the recipe is complete. T-55s on the lowest skill setting will literally speaking return fire, hit and destroy M60s at the highest skill setting with the first round.\n\nIf you consider buying this, then keep this in mind: This game is from a developer that doesn't think that you should be able to expect MP in the 21st century simulator. Yes, MP as in multiplayer. Let that stand as an indication to how fundamentally twisted this mess is.\n\nIf you're looking for an armour sim, then this is not for you. Just bite the pillow and get Steel Beasts instead and save yourself wasting money on this. It is neither realistic, nor playable.","October 12, 2015","false","18.1"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","29","4","14","3","0"
