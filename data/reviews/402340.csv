It’s a game that feels straight from an arcade gallery in the 80s but manages to fit perfectly into today’s standards, and I’m glad I didn’t have to put quarters in to keep playing, cause I died A LOT. Old-school challenge.\n\nThe controller response time is quick, and it has to be because the difficulty keeps climbing to the point where you must be absolutely sure of what you’re pressing, with almost no margin for error. There were points when I the screen was covered in bullets, and I was just there trying not to panic, But it gets hard without getting to a point of frustration, and every time I died I knew it was because I had done something wrong and not because the game was unfair. Could use some checkpoints, though. Also, the power-ups should look a bit different. Maybe with letters, like in Contra. But, as it is, the weapon system is varied and has no actual flaws. Blowing robots up sounds like a good time and Blue Rider makes it as fun as it can be with a nice progression in armory.\n\nAt the end of each level you find a different final boss, and that’s by far the best part. Their designs feel detailed and they’re really hard! I ended up using different strategies with each of them and that took me a while to figure out, but the feeling of reward you get after finally beating them is unmatched. I’d certainly try out a Boss Rush Mode, one after another (Defeated 4 bosses until now)\n\nHaven’t finished it yet, but I’ve been playing for a while and it doesn’t seem to be stopping anytime soon. And, while i died a couple of times, I just kept coming back for more.\n\n\nSummary:\nAn easy recommendation for anyone interested in a fast and challenging game. The sort of game that makes you stay up until you manage to beat one more level.","March 3","true","0.8"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/402340/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","In what has been a year thus far loaded with twinstick shooters – I believe that I have discovered the best of them all with Ravegan’s Blue Rider. In fact, it wouldn’t be too far out of place to suggest that this may be one of my favorite and most enjoyable games of the year. I’m hopeful that it’s a title that will get picked up by the critics for their review but thus far only Brash Games have picked up on it and they scored it a perfect 10/10.\n\nThe game has you playing around as a blue spaceship riding and guiding yourself through levels that are littered with enemies of the robotic kind. There are a significant number of different enemy types throughout the game all with their own little quirks and powers. Getting accustomed to each of them is a vitally important component of becoming a skilled player. After you’ve beaten the waves of enemies that are just waiting to kick your ♥♥♥ you have to deal with a boss. Although there are health drops (green) along with bombs (pink/purple) and blue (rampage) they (health orbs) are are few and far between and standing a chance against most of the bosses – the first boss in the game was relatively easy if you think about the strategy required for just a moment – will mean that you need to keep as much health as possible because you’ll need it to survive the battle. Should you die at any stage of the level it’s game over. However, thankfully you don’t have to repeat stages that you have already beaten.\n\nWhat I really loved about the game is the feeling that I’ve taken a step back into the days of the SEGA and Nintendo consoles. I’m currently in the midst of reading the awesome book Console Wars and to play a game that reminded me of that era but with the full production values that modern technology affords was a real delight. The graphics and the sound are a perfect match for what the game achieves and the controls are every bit as tight as what you would hope that they would be. But it’s the fantastic retro flashback feeling that does it for me. It’s a great accomplishment.\n\nNow I feel the need to get something off of my chest. One does not simply ask someone to tell their friends what a great game one is. To see this text in between the first and second levels was not only something I would deem to be unprofessional but also very tacky. If someone is going to tell someone that a game is great or special they’re going to do it because they want to do it and for no other reason.  That this is the only criticism that I can honestly level against the game speaks volumes to its quality. But to provide that in the spot of a game tip was humorous and not in a positive way for Ravegan.\n\nBlue Rider requires skill, persistence and a lot of concentration in order to defeat each stage but the effort is well and truly worth it. Experiences of such a level are few and far between and thus I wholeheartedly recommend it.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group\n","March 16","true","2.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

A lone pilot tasked with the unenviable mission of destroying an army of bad guys armed with tanks, cannons and a whole heap of gun wielding mechs. And, as with many shmups, it’s all up to you but there is help along the way in the form of numerous weapon upgrades for your little ship that allow you to dispatch your enemies with greater efficiency.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm not sure if this game will have a whole lot of longevity or replayability as it does only have 9 relatively simple stages and at $13 is a little over-priced (I definitely peg this as more of a $5-10 game). But it does have a nice variety of enemies and some level design does kind of remind me of those cute early 3D worlds of the 32-bit and 64-bit era of games. And once you get used to the slightly floaty controls of your hovership it is a fun "pick up and play" type of game.\n\nDefinitely not for a hardcore audience but a fun, casual experience nonetheless.","March 3","true","2.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

It checks a lot of the boxes that build the kind of game that catches my eye. I do have one minor gripe, and maybe I'm just missing it and others can help me out here. This is the kind of game that I love to jump into with the volume down low so I can blast away to my heart's content while catching up on some of my favorite podcasts. With this title, however, there doesn't seem to be any way to affect the volume of either the music or sound effects. I found that somewhat strange, but, again, if I'm all wet here and have somehow missed the volume controls, someone give me a shout. Minor gripe to be sure, and otherwise some good fun to be had.","March 5","true","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has elements of R-Type with a dash of The Chaos Engine with a visual style reminiscent of Megaman. While progression through each level is somewhat linear, the game does allow players to navigate and explore each level at their own pace. The visual style of Blue rider is cartoonish, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t fun to look at.\n\nBlue Rider as a whole is simple, for better or for worse. There are two weapons, primary (guns) and secondary (bombs). Each has two varieties that can be switched and upgraded as power-ups are claimed. There are no vehicle options. Personally, I enjoy a bit more meat in this department though the simplicity is also part of this game’s charm. What it lacks in depth it makes up for in good solid game design.\n\n(tl;dr)\n\nMy experience with Blue Rider was one of clenched teeth and the occasional outburst of profanities. Best described as a bullet-hell shooter, this game really does give the player what it promises. Action.\n\n7.5/10\n\n\n","March 4","true","6.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/recommended/402340/","hyperduel","Hyperduel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hyperduel/","1983 products in account","Product received for free\n\nIf there's one genre of game I just can't get enough of, it's arcade-style twin-stick shooters. Especially ones which innovate and bring something fresh and exciting to the table in some creatively disctinct way. So upon noticing such a compelling new title named Blue Rider, an indie Unity Engine single-player game developed & published by Ravegan, I just knew that I had to quickly explore what it had to offer. Because it was apparent that this was one where I was actually able to enter lush 3D worlds with my ship while having full freedom of 360 degree movement to explore its every nook and cranny on my own terms...ferreting out every last enemy hiding in wait for me through its many winding paths & corridors.\n\nUpon spending some quality time with it, it become immediately obvious to me that this was a hidden gem with so much potential for hours of addictive fun, the kind of experience which causes time to melt in between the hypnotic sounds of pew-pew bullets and thundering explosions as your enemies quickly become fine-sized shrapnel before your very eyes.\n\nTo begin, I will expand upon what the game gets right, which is quite a significant amount of positives I might add. Firstly, the sense of immersion within the game was breathtaking since it felt like I was inside an actual place brimming with intrigue & wonder....replete with dense vegetation, bodies of water, and charming old-world enigmas like stone pyramids and pillars. This creative artwork style is stellar and impressed me immensely, soon capturing my imagination with ease. It all tied seamlessly together in bringing me a palpable sense that I was inside of some strange land awaiting for me to explore & discover its many foreboding secrets while fighting off an endless array of distinctive enemies and even monster sized bosses found waiting for me at the end of each stage.\n\nWhich then quickly brings me to another positive attribute, it showcases nine full sized stages and undoubtedly feels like a full game. One with which you can sit back for several hours and enjoy to the fullest. Because you must complete each one first before advancing to the next...and you only have one single life & health meter to do so...so making sure to steer clear of the enemies' firepower is crucial for success here. And that involves continuous deft movement of your ship which also has a dynamic sprint ability to increase your speed (as long as the button is pressed). I will say however, that I kind of wish that the sprint speed was simply the default speed for the entire duration of the game since you pretty much need this kind of continuous agility in order to make quick movements at any given moment. But nonetheless, the current setup more than suffices.\n\nYour firepower consists of both primary (bullets) and secondary weapons (missiles) which can be swapped in-game with captured power-ups from destroyed enemies. It's your basic straight-forward system here, nothing fancy or overly complicated, and pretty much just what you'd expect from such a game with very minimalist controls. This all makes it to be very accessible for both casual and hardcore gamers alike I might add.\n\nNow onto the actual gameplay...I felt that it was overall quite solid because it's imperative that you continue to strategically move about in most sections where enemies are present, since their bullets keep aiming in your general direction. This certainly makes for edgy and tense encounters when several of them are simultaneously gunning for you. And I found it to be a thrill in methodically clearing the screen of their presence, picking them off one by one until the threat gradually subsided. Additionally, they each have their own individual health meters to display how much more damage they require for complete obliteration, which was quite a nice touch I thought. I will mention here as well that your bullets do curve as you rotate the ship/screen which adds to the aiming challenge somewhat. Some may or may not prefer this, but for me personally I didn't mind it at all.\n\nThere was one facet of this title which I found to be lacking however, and that was the very unsatisfying number of configuration options...which consisted of only 3 (resolution / graphics quality / mouse sensitivity). I'd have loved the ability to remap my controls, change difficulty settings, as well as an option to disable controller support completely so that my non-Xbox360 controller could be used via a third-party keyboard remapping program. As it was, I was relegated to using the mouse/keys for controls which isn't really optimal for such a game. And if not for this issue, I would certainly rate this as being a nearly perfect twin-stick shooter in a heartbeat. It is my hope that more such configuration options will be added to it by the developers in a future update, which would be most appreciated!\n\nVerdict\nAll in all, this is a very impressive addition to the genre, one which will be sure to delight those who enjoy high-quality shooters with a thoughtful design. And if you already own a 360 controller, you'll be able to experience the full satisfaction that it has to offer in a heartbeat. Because where it shines is in its fantastic sense of immersion, its inspiring artwork, its sense of discovery, as well as rock-solid gameplay. It will hook you in hard and not let you go until you've finally completed all of its very challenging stages, rewarding you with Steam achievments the entire way through as your gritty Blue Rider ship conquers these vast worlds and comes out on top to claim victory over these tamed lands.\n\nThis impressive twin-stick shooter receives a well-earned 4 out of 5 stars from me.\n\n\nPros:\n- Addictive & very challenging arcade-style gameplay\n- Stunningly beautiful worlds with a distinctive artwork design\n- A full 9 stages of gameplay plus bosses\n- Full controller support\n- Weapon power-ups\n- Scoring system\n- Steam achievements\n\nCons:\n- A lack of robust configuration options\n- Non-remappable controls\n- Only 1 difficulty setting\n- Inability to disable controller support which interferes with controller-to-keyboard remapping programs\n\n\nFor similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com","June 5","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Power ups are to be had but watch your step and don’t die or you will lose that advantage and be back to square one.\n\nPros:\n\n-	Beautiful graphics and game play that takes you back to games of old, the way we wish they had looked but with new and improved AI and controls.\n-	A number of unique enemies that grow harder with every passing level\n-	Fun and exciting power ups that will leave you wanting to try the next upgrade.\n\nCons:\n\n-	Only nine levels will leave you wanting more as you can if your skill holds out complete this game in under 3 hours.\n-	No saving your progress (power ups) from one game to the next once you log out. (Levels gained are still there just the loss of power ups from previous games are gone and must be regained all over again even without a death.)\n-	No Multiplayer as of yet.\n\nIn conclusion, Blue Rider is a fun jaunt down memory lane for those who remember these types of games from their childhood or for those wishing to experience it for the first time.
