This is not Dungeon Keeper. It is not close to Dungeon Keeper. It will not fill the void in your heart left by Dungeon Keeper.\n\nMy biggest gripe: trying to set up an economy using this system requires a tedious amount of micro-management: You need enemy heroes to be able to easily get to your loot, then intercept them before they easily get away with it. By definition, this means you need to change something about your set-up on the fly, for every hero, in real time.\n\nA slog that misses everything about what made the genre fun.","November 29, 2013","false","1.6"," 156 of 190 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","156","190","2","0"

With that out off the way, this game is good in it's own right. The first couple levels are basically tutorials and are slow, but if you get past the first couple it does become more challengeing. When I first bought this game I had the idea that it would play similar to the Dungeon Keeper games. Upon playing it I was frustrated that it wasn't and promptly removed it and didn't play it again for a long while. However, one day I decided to reinstall and give it a shot without comparing it, to my surprise I wanted to play more.\n\nYour objective is to give the heroes that enter your dungeon everything they want filling their soul meters, then destroy them before they get a chance to leave your dungeon. Using their souls to buy "gimmicks" that you use to fill your dungeon leading the heroes throughout it, and making you more powerful. There is a balance you need to strike to get the heroes happy without having your creatures accidently slay them to soon, and losing soul energy in the process, as yourself the "Dungeon Lord" gets more soul energy from killing the heroes personally. I find trying to build my dungeon in such a way to completly fill the heroes soul bars and leading them to my dungeon heart, where I await them, to be challengeing and statisfing.\n\nI rate it 7/10, because I thoroughly enjoy playing it. But at times it has crashed while trying to autosave and there are a couple missions that are still broke and cannot be completed. Just give it a chance it may surprise you, like it did for me.","October 23, 2014","true","115.8"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","50","57","0","0"

There's no mass battles with heroes, and your minions don't fight them, not really. Instead you find dungeon entrences, put a hallway across from them with a bit of treasure at the other end, and a corneer to hide behind. Heroes arrive one at a time, on a timer, see the gold, go to pick it up, and once they're done, you club them and have a goblin drag them back to the dungeon. By this point the hero arrival timer is almost up again, and you do wait for the next one to come along, find treasure, get clubbed, etc and you do this until you realize the whole game is just doing this over and over and get tired of it.","November 26, 2013","false","1.0"," 67 of 84 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","67","84","0","0"

This game is overly complicated and you feel like you aren't really running a dungeon.  You feel like you are the dungeon overlord who has to do the work completely by himself by killing all the adventurer's yourself because your bats, rats, etc don't see to do much work and seem to be reliant on the adventurer's attacking them.  You also can't pick them up and move them where you want to like you can in Dungeons ii where it feels like you are actually running a dungeon instead of just going around with your main guy and attacking Adventurer's.  Also you have to get something archaic called Soul Energy from the Adventurer's which means you have to let them beat up your creatures, steal you gold, etc so their green bars go up before you kill them because they are worth more soul energy that way and you can lock them up in cages to get some extra soul energy also.  Problem is this means adventurer's pile up in your dungeon meaning you might have to fight multiplies at once making your job tougher since your main guy is the only one that seems to do any of the killing.  You also get archaic Prestige points that allow you to build "gimmicks" to occupy the adventurer's and make their soul energy production go up as well.  I am glad that I bought Dungeons ii first or I might have got turned off this title line.  If I had bought dungeons i first there is a good chance I would never have discovered what a great game dungeons ii is in actually managing a dungeon instead of just attacking like some arcade game with your main guy.  In dungeons ii your objective is to kill the adventurer's as quickly as possible not let them hang out and get tougher.\n\nSave your money buy dungeons ii if you want a real game in this genre.  I absolutely love that game but can't see myself putting any more time into dungeons i as it seems pointless.  Also you can't see your entire dungeon like you can in dungeons ii and it's very dark and hard to see exactly what is going on.  The creatures are much larger and more visible in dungeons ii.","May 25, 2015","false","7.1"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","2"

As the spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper, I had very high hopes for this game. It is, saddly, terrible. Everything that made the previous game unique and interesting (monsters moving into and interacting with your dungeon, converting enemies to your cause, waging war against the forces of good,) have all been stripped away.\n\nYes, you can place monsters in your dungeon and have them protect narrow areas, but they don't roam the area, they don't interact with your dungen, and there are very few types available. The troll/blacksmiths are gone, and so are their traps, doors, and other gadgets to make the dungeon interesting. The prisons remain, but the Mistresses are gone so enemies can't be converted. The only reason you even capture them is to get soul energy out of them.\n\nYou no longer wage war. Yes, you can fight heroes, and your mosnters will too. However, you can no longer send your monsters after heroes, they will only engage if the hero happens to stumble into them. Of course, you wouldn't want to send monsters after heroes aanymore either, since they need to survive to be fattened up with soul energy.\n\nIt is like they tooke the most basic features of Dungeon Keeper, kept those, and threw away everything that gave the game character. Now, you must run about taking care of every little task using your avatar, with no help from the decorative monsters. Basically, this has become FarmVille with a slightly darker background and sub-par voice acting.","April 8, 2014","false","4.4"," 42 of 63 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","42","63","0","1"

Now there is the Quest for Epic Loot (which is like MMO...ish) and Imps and . .. kay, bored now.\n\nPoint is, this is it's own game. This is micro-management-heavy-as-hell and on top of that, lacks a certain pizaz that gets things to keep going after 20 hours or so (note: I played this a lot before this most recent sale on steam in which I acquired it here) . The biggest customization is nearly meaningless decor. So much is too complecated in practice and yet overly simple in feeling .. which is all sorts of weird (mostly comes from how easy it is to kill heroes on entering without pleasing them) --- this game, like many, requires you to give to it in order to give back. Unlike the best games which tend to be lower on the graphical scale and ask imagination -- this is a dressed up version (kinda) of a lot of things and the missing bits are the innate charm, and the strange feeling of -something- missing.\n\nWhat am I on about?\n\nThis is not Dungeon Keeper. Stop pretending it sucks because of that. This is a solid 7 out of 10 (saying 5 is passing for a 20 USD game) -- this game is good, and above average (but actually less impressive for the year it was released than this last 12 months. .then it was only a 6, but 2013 sucked on every possible level).\n\nMore importantly, the gold pack with the standalone DLC was 7.50 USD for me, and that is a GREAT deal. a good 30 hours of enjoyment between the two, and only a few hours of lacklustre play in there.\n\nNot the best game ever, but I do recommend it.","March 13, 2014","true","2.3"," 35 of 58 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","35","58","0","0"

The whole concept and game play/mechanics are a different thing altogether.\n\nIn dungeons, you control the dungeon lord who can roam the dungeon instead of being the large god hand. You don't cater for your creatures, you aim to please the humans that come down.\nThey have different needs and are impressed by a wide verity of interactions.\n\nAs the humans travel through your amusement dungeon they interact with the scenery objects (gimmicks) and the rooms you build.\nWhen they do this, they will gain 'soul energy' until they are fully satisfied and will head back out the dungeon... however that soul energy is what you are after and letting them escape will lose this valuable resource used to create a more impressive dungeon, killing them or torturing them is the way to collect it before they leave.\n\nCreatures are summoned by placing a summoning location down, these are unlocked by having getting a nest within your influence area, which you expand by placing the summoning locations.\nThese creatures will stay in close proximity to the spawn and fight any of the humans that they see. Whilst they can kill the humans it's not the main purpose. Some of the needs are related to combat weather it's to deal damage or be hit, creatures will fulfil this need.\nThere's no management for the creatures, they don't require sleep or food.\n\nYou will need to manage your hero quite a bit, making sure to kill people when it's time and also to protect the dungeons heart, if destroyed you will lose.\nThis happens if the humans are unhappy with the dungeon and would rather destroy it. They can also decide to attack after sharing their experiences with each other as the humans do like to talk to one another meaning one unhappy person can trigger others to join.\n\nDungeons is definitely worth playing if you liked Dungeon keeper (who doesn't?) and are willing to accept that it's not the same game but still want a dungeon management game.","May 22","true","32.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is fun, if you like time management and quirky stuff.\nNo, it isn't dungeon keeper, and no where does it claim to be dungeon keeper. You can't just assume it's the same because they start with the same word. It's not necessary to give so many negative reviews to a game because you miss your childhood favorites.\nBasically, it's like all the time management business games, except your income is how happy you make the raiding heroes before you kill them. It's got elements of city building and sims style designing to personalize the dungeon however you like. And it's got a cute goth feel to it, with clumsy imps and demanding demons.\nIt's a bit more complex then your standard restaurant time management game, and you need to stay on top of what is going on everywhere in your dungeon. If you don't plan it out and design the layout well, it'll fall apart when you're so close to winning.","July 26, 2014","true","20.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I did not like this because you are tasked with base building and at the same time to micro your hero in killing adventurers that go into your base. However you only want to kill/capture them when they have filled their satisfaction meter to max. This is doubly annoying when you cannot control your other forces so your hero can be somewhere else. This all ends up in a whole lot of micromanagement and stress for the player.\n\nThe game is also quite low-budget, the price set for it is highly overrated, I would value this game at about 30€ due to content and quality of execution. I cannot recommend buying this unless its at 5€ though, and even then I would be a hard sale.\n\nDo not buy.","February 6, 2011","false","26.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","2"

This game is also a poor teacher; critical features (like leveling up your monsters) are never taught by the game, I just stumbled on the tiny (barely 9x9pixel) button that levels up creatures on my own.  But the gameplay isn't the worst thing about this game. No the worst part is the voice acting!

He speaks so slowly its painful.\n\nOne has the option to skip the speaking parts by hitting the space key, but each time a speaking sequence starts, it steals my focus and starts a mini-cutscene, stealing precious extra seconds from my life that I will never get back as I march forward towards the grave.\n\nThis game is like a nursing home, its slow, its tedious, its filled with people that talk way too slowly about things I don't care about ("OH, OH DO I CLICK THE HERO TO ATTACK IT?!

I have lamented the death of Dungeon Keeper 3 for years, and finally it has been reborn in a modern form with new gameplay mechanics. The idea of harvesting soul energy from heroes you have pampered and 'built up', only to tear them down and lock them away is deliciously evil. Managing a dungeon in this manner can be difficult, (it's YOUR gold in those piles....so you end up running out fairly quickly if heroes take alot of it.) there's a good deal of micro management involved, as well as planning, room building, etc. All to tease those heroes with lovely jewels, books, equipment, and more, so you can suck all of that out of them when they fall. The soul energy collected goes to prestiege items which make your dungeon more impressive, and boost your power.

I have lamented the death of Dungeon Keeper 3 for years, and finally it has been reborn in a modern form with new gameplay mechanics. The idea of harvesting soul energy from heroes you have pampered and 'built up', only to tear them down and lock them away is deliciously evil. Managing a dungeon in this manner can be difficult, (it's YOUR gold in those piles....so you end up running out fairly quickly if heroes take alot of it.) there's a good deal of micro management involved, as well as planning, room building, etc. All to tease those heroes with lovely jewels, books, equipment, and more, so you can suck all of that out of them when they fall. The soul energy collected goes to prestiege items which make your dungeon more impressive, and boost your power.

It's a humours game where you get to customize your dungeon keeper (you play the big boss basicly) and you build your dungeon in order to give heroes a "good adventure" inside of it, once they are happy and fat and pleased with themselves you beat the hell out of them and throw them in prison, sucking their soul energy, witch lets you build and further upgrade your dungeon.

All i read about it though are people going full idiot and talking about a game in 1997 that hasn't aged too well. This isn't Dungeon Keeper, it never claimed to be Dungeon Keeper, nor is it trying to de-throne some soap box that everyone places Dungeon Keeper on. They're not the same game, get the ♥♥♥♥ over it.\n\nAnyhow. I am enjoying this game. The graphics are presentable, the humor is childish and flows well, and the strategy is moderate. Sure, you could just place a hallway and put a pile of gold on it, but you're going to be there a long time. Players who actually pay attention to what the game teaches you will learn about libraries and needs of adventurers. This one is a masochist, ergo if he finds whatever monster you plant that roughs him up, he's going to get happy. Greedy hero? Piles of gold fill are quickly stuffed into pockets by greedy adventurers. Nerd? Library.\n\nThe formula is simple, and i can see the tedium in the later levels, but it has the customization and thought behind it that would appeal to the fans of games like Rollercoaster Tycoon and the like. This has a medium story behind it, so it keeps you entertained while pretty much helping you work on basic strategy.\n\n8/10 in my books.","February 13, 2014","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you liked Kalypso's previous game "Ceville", then you'll probably enjoy "Dungeons" on your first playthrough or two, but the game gets pretty repetitive even during the campaign. If you played the "Dungeon Keeper" games, you'll probably find yourself wishing you were playing those games instead.\nThis is not to say that "Dungeons" isn't fun, but it doesn't have nearly the same level of detail and control that older games had. You can't, for example, pick up creatures, or create complex dungeons with many different rooms. The concession "Dungeons" makes to customability is to add in lots and lots of "gimmicks", which are decorative items that have the added benefit of making your Dark Lord stronger. "Dungeons" is the smaller, pudgier, comic-relief sidekick of  "Dungeon Keeper 2". If you like humor as a substitute for play, then go ahead and get "Dungeons".","September 30, 2011","false","85.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

No matter how much I really want it to be War For The Overworld.\n\nThis game is, however, more like what would happen if someone decided to try and mix Dota 2 and Dungeon Keeper.\nYou have a physical pressence in the game you have to manually direct to attack, activate things and generally progress.\nWhile games like Baldurs Gate may spring to mind. this does not have much in the way of combat other than 'go attack that person... right, they died...'. There is no customisation of your 'keeper' further than leveling up to gain spells with real-time cool-downs...\nThis might be better likened to Overlord, but without the cusomisation of your weapons... or the thrilling gameplay.\n\nI don't like games that have me watching for seconds, checking my mana, waiting for a specific moment between the slow, repeating combat animations and then unleashing some spell that i'm going to have to wait another 00:40 to use again. This is not Warcraft!\n\nThe game quickly gets pissy and overly picky about what you need to do. The dynamic of 'let heroes in and let them get real happy to farm their souls' comes off as a little strange at best. Let them walk in, slay your creatures, then plunder the convenient piles of gold lay around?\noh... kaay?\nkill them on their way out so you don't lose the gold and do gain their souls.\nRight?\nOk, let's do that while trying to dig out some more rooms of your dungeon, expand your area of influence with pentagrams that summon enemies and need population points to build and build some decorations to give yourself prestiege. Don't forget to complete the challenges on each level to level up your guy to get better combat spells and that... did I forget to mention if you take too long, the next b*gger comes in and starts plundering somewhere else? Oh, and you're being attacked by someone else on the other side of your dungeon, better get back there. Better still, teleport somewhere even further away if you want to get there faster!\nuuh... no!\n\nThere is too much fiddly, useless and over-complicated systems.\nI can't compare this to dungeon keeper. that would be an insult to both games.\nThis has multiple 'currencies' to constantly keep an eye on as you're building. Lacking tutorials that leave you not entirely sure what you're supposed to be doing and, I hate to be mean, but if you're playing a game about managing a dungeon, i don't need to tell myself to walk over here so the hero doesn't see me before i kill him... honestly, it does not seem very well thought out.\n\nI would love to change my review, but this is too under-developed to be an MMO, far too far away from being simple enough to play casually and, to be frank, no fun.","October 29, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Unfortunately.\n\nYour goal is to design a dungeon that is 'fun' enough and rewarding enough to satisfy adventurers - so that you can harvest their happiness.\n\nIt's too puzzley to feel like a satisfying strategy game, and to 'fuzzy' to be a working puzzle.  Adventurers move around in a semi-random manner, and most levels have so many already dug out paths that you can't effectively funnel them.\n\nYou're also penalized if adventurers die to your monsters and traps.  Instead you have to run over to them personally and deliver the killing blow.  This and other mechanics lead to an incredibly annoying amount of micromanagement.\n\nIt sucks.

You can, but that's not the purpose of the game.  Wanton killing is not the brand of Evil that the Dungeon Lord pursues.  That's too simplistic for him.\n\n\nIt's about designing and decorating a dungeon full of interesting features that heroes can admire.  It's about treasuries that can make thieves lose their caution, libraries that can make wizards forget about the dangers, and constant battles that can make knights get lost in a haze of battle lust.  It's about creating a complex that heroes can admire for its beauty and can feel good about themselves for "conquering".  It's about those invaders not realizing that the place was designed that way, not until the moment when you crush them under the heel of your boot.\n\n\nIt's all about the sin of pride.  Pride over the aesthethics of your dungeon.  Pride over how you've led those stupid heroes by the nose to where you want them to go with the lure of gold, books, and kills.  Pride over how fast you can "fatten them up" before you personally slaughter or capture them for their soul energy.  It's all about showing off how great the Dungeon Lord (you) is in terms of prestige and prowess.\n\n\nIn summary, the game is not about how great you are at training the might of your minions.  It is about you personally beating the crap out of invaders through melee and magic.  It is not about how good you are at designing dangerous deathtraps.  It is about building beautiful complexes that even heroes admire.  It's not about how well you can build an army for conquering the world.  It is about how good you are at bleeding your enemies dry of energy and gold while you pursue your primary goals.  This game is all about you regaining your reputation as being the top Dungeon Lord by showing off your dungeons and your skills.  It is all about...

Unfortunately.\n\nYour goal is to design a dungeon that is 'fun' enough and rewarding enough to satisfy adventurers - so that you can harvest their happiness.\n\nIt's too puzzley to feel like a satisfying strategy game, and to 'fuzzy' to be a working puzzle.  Adventurers move around in a semi-random manner, and most levels have so many already dug out paths that you can't effectively funnel them.\n\nYou're also penalized if adventurers die to your monsters and traps.  Instead you have to run over to them personally and deliver the killing blow.  This and other mechanics lead to an incredibly annoying amount of micromanagement.\n\nIt sucks.

You can, but that's not the purpose of the game.  Wanton killing is not the brand of Evil that the Dungeon Lord pursues.  That's too simplistic for him.\n\n\nIt's about designing and decorating a dungeon full of interesting features that heroes can admire.  It's about treasuries that can make thieves lose their caution, libraries that can make wizards forget about the dangers, and constant battles that can make knights get lost in a haze of battle lust.  It's about creating a complex that heroes can admire for its beauty and can feel good about themselves for "conquering".  It's about those invaders not realizing that the place was designed that way, not until the moment when you crush them under the heel of your boot.\n\n\nIt's all about the sin of pride.  Pride over the aesthethics of your dungeon.  Pride over how you've led those stupid heroes by the nose to where you want them to go with the lure of gold, books, and kills.  Pride over how fast you can "fatten them up" before you personally slaughter or capture them for their soul energy.  It's all about showing off how great the Dungeon Lord (you) is in terms of prestige and prowess.\n\n\nIn summary, the game is not about how great you are at training the might of your minions.  It is about you personally beating the crap out of invaders through melee and magic.  It is not about how good you are at designing dangerous deathtraps.  It is about building beautiful complexes that even heroes admire.  It's not about how well you can build an army for conquering the world.  It is about how good you are at bleeding your enemies dry of energy and gold while you pursue your primary goals.  This game is all about you regaining your reputation as being the top Dungeon Lord by showing off your dungeons and your skills.  It is all about...
