I find the anomilies of time and space, and steadily the world I know shifts into one I do not. The people are different, I am somebody else, and the story continues, reality flickering to remind me that there is more yet to change, more realities to see.\n\nDo I have any idea what's going on? Not really, but I'm damn sure I'm creeped the hell out, weirded out, and enjoying every minute of it. This game is definitely worth a try and worth its price tag\n\nEDIT: I just finished this game and damn... it's so simple yet it maintains the suspense right up to the end. I'm not even sure what the end WAS, even having achieved it, but I can definitely safely recommend this game. It's weird, it's unique, and those things together with excellent execution make for a damn good game!","February 17","true","3.5"," 104 of 133 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","104","133","10","0"

It's hidden object, except instead of objects there are sigils, and they become visible only from certain points of the map. That is, you have to run around and wildly rotate your viewport.\nI can't see how any amount of polish could save this concept.\n\nI completed two sets of sigils, and stuck on finding last one in the cafe. Should I stand in this corner? No? Near this table? Try to stand by the door? Still nothing new? Step-by-step scan all walkable surfaces? Did I look in every direction?\nWhat was I playing again? Oh, a psychedelic tribute to one of greatest sci-fi authors of 20th century.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/recommended/402060/","BirdCute","BirdCute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BirdCute/","1507 products in account","Californium is a weird game.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are in Californium, where you are known as a writer, who doesn't really write a lot and has some issues with drugs and relations to his close ones. For some reason, the world you're located in is shifting between different realities. You have who and why is doing that, while exploring the world around you.\n\nPros:    Visual Style | Is simply astonishing. The world is beautiful and it just looks perfect. You could just be making screenshots all the time and setting them as your desktop background. It's one of the most beautiful games this year so far for sure.\nGame Mechanics | Are weird. I didn't quite understand what am I supposed to do at first, but I don't understand the game anyway. I mean, I kind of do, but not really. It's just a wonderful experience. You are on a hunt for theta-shaped symbols, which only appear when you look at them from certain angle or look away from them and then click them quickly. It's different. While doing that, you also walk around and talk to people.\nStoryline | Is complicated. At first, you won't understand what's happening and that's fine. The whole thing kind of clears up as you proceed in the game, but it feels kind of surreal all the time. Since this is something I like, this game is certainly for me. If you prefer killing people and running around, go buy CS:GO.\nSoundtrack | Is ... interesting? And it does good to my ears. It just fits the style of this game and, well, I liked listening to is.\nVoice Acting | Is as good as it should be. Every word that is spoken in game is voice acted and it just gives the impression that the game is made by professionals.\nCons:    Messed-up Controls | When I started the game, it visually instructed me to use WASD keys to walk. That didn't work. When opening up the settings, the default setup was the weirdest one ever. I don't quite remember what it was, but it was something like CHTD. Also, there is no controller support.\nStairs | This is a really minor problem, but still: if you walk up the stairs and stop before you get to the top, you will slowly slide down again. Weird.\nSaving | This game really really doesn't save your progress often enough. Although I like playing games like this one, I find it difficult to play for one hour without a break and that's where I like to have my progress saved. So, when I closed the game hoping that it was saved, I had to start all over again. And that happened to me twice.\nPerformance Issues | This game is really demanding when it comes to system resources, which is weird, because other Unity games usually aren't that demanding. I'm afraid this may be a big problem for some players.\nLinux Support | Well, there isn't one. Unity has native support for Linux, so I don't know why Californium doesn't support it. I know it still requires some work to make a Linux build, but it's not like it would need months of work.\nThe final verdict:This is the definition of a strange game. That's because it's a game and it's freaking strange. Before buying it, please, please, do yourself a favour and watch a Youtube video or two about Californium. If you like this kind of atmosphere, you'll love it, but you really need to be into this kind of games. Otherwise, you might soon start hating it.\nI recommend this game, I really do. But this game is not for everybody, so be cautious when buying it. The price is really good for a nice-looking game like this one so consider buying it.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

You explore beautiful levels and "solve" puzzles.\n\nIf you are someone who values art and design in a video game world I think you will like this too. My only complaint is that it doesn't save your progress within a chapter, so be careful when you exit.\n\nEdit - Tired of getting stuck on something stupid because of this game's physics and having to restart an entire level I just spent 45 minutes on. Seriously? No way to save progress??\n\nEdit - I can no longer recommend this game after experiencing too many game-breaking bugs and having to replay entire chapters each time.

PKD fans will definitely find something interesting here.\n\nThe game is a little out there at times however this is personally something I look for and love in games. I like games that strive to be a little different, one reason I love indies so much. My playthrough took about 3.5 hours and the story moves along at a steady pace. The english voice acting is top notch and the visuals while simple really stand out with the great use of colours. The puzzles are simple in design and some take a little time to find, lucky for me the couple of times I was having troubles viewers were there to make suggestions.\n\nI did run into a bug in the restuarant at the start of Chapter 2 and had to restart it, luckily for me we had a couple of devs in the twitch chat who explained the bug without us wasting to much time. The game has already had its 1st update which should have fixed this bug along with others.\n\nThis is a difficult game to recommend due to it being a little different. However fans of PKD or people that are into quirky games will likely get a kick out of it. I do suggest scanning the game on youtube / twitch to know what your getting into. I made a VOD fof my playthrough.\n\nThe game is definitely strange but I loved it.","February 17","true","3.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

I love the Bay Area (live there), love the PDK inspiration, love the artstyle, love some of the sound(s) and love creativity & originality.\n\nThe reason I'm mixed is due to a little bugginess and honestly the game requiring a little too much patience on my part (I'm a pretty patient dude too). It almost feels at times like it is bordering along "ambient" gaming to solve the "puzzles".  And by "puzzles" I mean the game relies heavily on one core mechanic: find the right spot for clicky, click, repeat. This becomes a bit tedious; even for a $10 game and not immersive. Which sucks because obviously this game has the right ingredients for being very immersive (or even only immersive without clicky click, aka Alien Isolation mod removing the Alien - aka spontaneous combustion exploration instead of clicky clicky) but the tedium of finding that one core mechanic puzzle to progress dampens the immersion & experience for me. This is where it becomes almost "ambient", the looping atmospheric effects and saying WTF is that little symbol to click, causing much retracing over an already limited (and by limited I mean small) map.\n\nIf you're in the right mood it could be hypnotic I suppose, but it can also be very, very grating. And by grating I mean it's like being stoned stuck in a loop trying to find that last nug you dropped somewhere over the course of a block, looking for that last clicky click, interdimensional pop in nug. And I don't know about you, but that isn't a place I like to be playing a game or in real life. But, alas, the characters in game usually have something to say. Which brings me to little details, voice acting is great and there are more than a few lines of interesting dialogue and good vibes, happy to see 2D sprite characters put to good use... but I also like the sound of a character's footsteps which is missing from this game - I'm not sure if it matters too much, I mean you slide down stairs which definitely makes sense in the more acidic parts, but seems missing in other areas.\n\nGood effort though and would love to see more in this vein, tongue, nose, or GVG pipe with a little more magic, sugar & elf spice (err gameplay).","February 17","true","5.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Sure, it's not everybody s cup of tea! In my opinion, it covers the spirit of "Californication". The twisted story and monologues / narrations are just great. You have the possibility to manipulate reality. Don't expect amazing graphics and character design. Gameplay can be described as solving (sort of) environmental hidden object puzzles. There is no way to save your progress within a chapter. If you like the unconventional experience, I can just recommend this trip. ;-)","February 20","true","4.3"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/402060/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","Bought the game solely because Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ was mentioned in the description and went in blind. Californium can be considered as a tribute to PKD's works -- A collection of weirdness familiar to readers of his books. In essence, Californium is a walking simulator where the sole gameplay element revolves around finding glitches in your reality: Items flickering in and out of existence, TV sets sending out secret, subversive messages only you can hear.\n\nIn ♥♥♥♥'s fiction, reality is always malleable, and such is the case also in Californium. Once you start peeling back the wool over your eyes, alternate realities begin to ooze into current ones. A sunny California baked in red turns into a grey, dystopian police state governed by the spirit of a long-gone president. Even you seem to change into a different person, but you still hear the omnipresent, self-aware narrator inside your head, and think the same thoughts you always did.\n\nIt doesn't stop there, though. The alternate realities keep on coming and the world gets progressively more out of joint. Californium is a very Dickian experience in the way that for most of the time, you have absolutely no idea what is going on. The game evokes paranoia and drug-induced delusion to the point where you cannot be certain about anything anymore.\n\nIn that way, the game probably nails a "true" PKD storyline better than any other game before it. I just wish the gameplay would be more interesting, because now the only thing you do is hunt for hotspots. Some of these are quite well hidden, and since you have to find them all to progress, frustration can occur if you get stuck. Diversity would have been more than welcome.\n\nAesthetically, Californium sits at a happy medium. People are represented as flat sprites in an otherwise 3D world; A decision that is probably budget-induced but which I actually found being a nice touch (it spares us from possibly cartoony 3D models). Some of the voice acting is definitely off, but isn't too distracting at the end of the day. I did also run into an unfortunate bug that forced me to replay an entire section, which is a shame.\n\nOverall, Californium is a hard game to recommend, but after weighing all of the aspects of the game I'm going to do that anyway. It's a very short experience with annoying gameplay mechanics and a few technical difficulties, but it also stays true enough to PKD's work to be worth checking out if you have a chance. But I'm probably biased; After all, Ubik is my favorite book.","February 21","true","2.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

You'll see once you play it for yourself, most things make zero sense.\n\nBut basically, from my impression, you play as a writer, you're addicted to drugs and suddenly you become able to travel through different dimensions or realities.\n\nI mean there's not much more I want to say for spoiler reasons and it's just weird... the game is strange and I highly recommend you check it out.\nThis game is like a Prequel to  Jazzpunk or something.\n\nPros:The art-style is great, really reminded me of  Jazzpunk, it's a very beautiful game. I sure as hell took a lot of screenshots of the abstract-like world and the weird and cool looking characters you talk to.\nThe actual gameplay, the mechanics, what you do to progress in the game are pretty cool little puzzles. You're looking for symbols/marks around the world to progress, some are easy to find some are hard.\nThe voice acting.. oh my god the voice acting is amazing. All the voice actors are professional as hell at their job in my opinion, it helped so much with the vibe and atmosphere of the game. It was just amazing, great work. Bad voice acting in a game like this would probably destroy the game, so I'm happy that proper actors worked on this.\nThe story in the game is I mean, it's cool but you wont really understand the reasoning behind everything, you're kinda thrown into it all. It makes more and more sense as you progress, but yea it's strange, this game is strange. This game is the definition of strange.\nThe music in the game is great, it fits this sort of game, and I'm happy that there's a varied amount of music, not just the same 2 or 3 songs playing over and over driving you insane.\nCons:It was very demanding performance wise on my computer which was surprising to me. So if you have a weak computer be wary I guess.\nThe graphics options is not impressive, I hate when a game only has 1 over-all graphic slider, would be much better if we could change everything separately, maybe I want this type of AA or this type of texture quality etc...\n\n\nI was pretty sure most of you are able to understand this but looking at the pathetic reviewers of this game I guess not,  don't buy this if you don't understand what you're getting yourself into, if you don't already enjoy games like this then there's no point at all in buying it.\nIt's like walking simulators, you know,  Dear Esther,  Drizzlepath etc... you either love them or you hate them. There is no in-between with games like that, this game falls under that as well. If you hated  Jazzpunk,  Thirty Flights of Loving and games similar to that, then you will hate this as well.\nIf you loved them, however, you will most likely love this game as well.\n\nBut, if you can accept that, if you're new to this category and can accept the fact beforehand that you'll probably be disappointed but there's a chance you'll be amazed, there's a chance you'll love it and regret not getting into these weird games earlier, then give it a chance. The price is right on this game in my opinion but there's always sales as well, put it in your whishlist and maybe one day you'll want to try it.\n\n8/10, absolutely great game for what it is.\nA must buy for any  Jazzpunk fan(and similar games).\nGet ready to be weirded out.","April 10","true","2.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I was actually discouraged to continue, then saw that the Development team are taking their jobs seriously and fixing the bugs less than 24 hours after they're found, which allowed me to finish the game on day 2.\n\nThe art is strange yet appealing, and is difficult to associate to anything else I've ever seen. The music is simple yet completely appropriate to what's going on in the game. The story will make you wonder and feel uneasy.\n\nIs this game perfect? No.\nIs it crazily addictive? Absolutely not.\nYou also shouldn't buy this game if you're looking for a great gameplay, a huge open world or if you like multiplayer.\n\nThat being said, I still do recommend this game, because I value original thought. You can feel that the developers of this game want to innovate and have taken the risk of exploring a new type of game, more of an interactive psychedelic storyline, almost as if you were reading a comic strip. This is not just another FIFA, Assassin's Creed or CoD.

Very atmospheric.  This game is not a shooter or rpg, not even an adventure game in that sense.  There are no items, no inventory.   All atmosphere.   This is a game that has to be slowly appreciated, do not rush through any of the sections.  Read the posters on the walls, look at the clothing on the characters.  Entire worlds are created here in this game!\nThis game is, to me, a real 3D novel.   A science fiction story come to life.\n\nThe cars cannot hit you, you cannot die.\n\nThe game opens I to his large apartment.   Walk slowly through the rooms, every object reflects not only the first person avatar,s life, these objects also reflect the world culture that exists in the world that you are in.\n\nA tip or to to max your enjoyment.    Those street cut out characters are not there just for atmosphere.  Each has a long story to tell you when you bump up against each.  But do not stop coming up to them when their lines are done with!  Like in some RPGs, each character often has a number of sentences to say, hear them out until they repeat themselves.\nThere are hot spots to activate.  Some can be hard to find.  Often these can be activate from hundreds of feet away!\nThe game saves only at each world completion!   Thus when you are able to leave the apartment and walk out onto the street, you are still in that one world yet!\n\nI love atmospheric games like this one.  Thus I give this game a five out of five.  Many do not like the game.  Probably these people are those who might not spend more than three minutes in Pompey, before getting back onto the tour bus!\n\nFreestone\n","February 22","true","8.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

In fact, I’d go as far as saying that it will only appeal to those who are into all things experimental. The individual struggles of characters never stand out and, in fact, even Elvin Green, who’s supposed to be the protagonist, ends up feeling simply like a vessel that moves the player through these really beautiful galleries at times. The visuals and the soundtrack are clearly the game’s strongest points. Thus, Californium is first and foremost a delight for the eyes and the ears. Then, it’s an analysis on the effects of Elvin’s writing upon him, done in a quasi-interactive manner. If that catches your interest, chances are you’ll enjoy at least bits of what Californium has to offer. Anyone with a different focus will end up questioning the worth of investing time in the game.

And the English voice acting is on a much higher level than the localization/translation bits and bobs so if you are worried about things being lost in translation that's not an issue, for me at least. And if you have even a passing familiarity with PKD then you ought to be able to catch the little nods to his books because, well, they aren't so little nor subtle. It *is* interesting to see a French perspective on a somewhat contemporary popular American mind and world(s) though. For that alone I feel the game is worth it to me. But this game is MOST DEFINITELY not for everyone, and I would be very selective with whom I reccomend it to. Most PKD fans should find something valuable in the game. I make the assumption that most PKD readers will be less critical of writing and more interested in unique and original ideas in general, and this game is certainly that.\n\nThe puzzle elements are a bit rudimentary and frustrating though, so there's that. It's hard for me to recomend it since I'm sure people will hate it, but I personally think it's interesting albeit bumpy. Yet the bumpiness sorta adds to the paranoia in a way, "is that a glitch or...?" And the rudimentary puzzles do get you to do what the devs intended and that is seeking other layers of reality, and this is done by getting you to scour the world for symbols (if you are familiar with the pigeon experiment in which it was fed at random intervals and the pigeon develops a sort of superstition about turning around a certain way or hopping on one foot in order to be fed--it's kinda like that). It's when you are at the point that you are looking for the final symbol in an area where you start to get the sensation of the crack fiend combing the carpet.\n\nEDIT:\n\nBTW, do not make the mistake I did on chapter two, going into the police station first before you get your migraine-junkie-shivers-whatever.

[D-word]. After doing some research, I found out that the developers of the game actually made Californium as a tribute to the works and theories of Philip. As someone who greatly enjoys Philip's writings, this game felt like an instant buy. A cool aesthetic, the trailer's trippy feel and the era in which it was based all contributed to making me buy the game based on impulse... And I quickly found myself regretting that decision.\n\nLike other "exploration" games, Californium features little to no gameplay. This isn't really an issue if the story is interesting enough and if it flows nicely, at least not to me. Exploration games, or "walking simulators" as some like to call them, have never been (and will never be) appealing to everyone but, see, I just couldn't handle this particular game. Is the story interesting? Yes, I must admit that it is. But that's not where the issue lies. The issue is in the way the progression of the story is padded out by what is, in essence, an easter egg hunt. In order to move the plot forward, you have to enter buildings and find hidden marks scattered across said establishment and, once you find them all, you're allowed to see the next chapter. That's it for the gameplay's essence, but it's execution makes it even worse. I found myself having to reset the second chapter twice due to glitches that didn't allow me to find the rest of the marks I needed.\n\nSo, what did Californium feel like in my short-lived experience with it? Well, to put it in simple terms, picture yourself reading a really interesting book. Now picture that book stopping you every page to solve "I Spy" puzzles before you can see the next one. You might have an incredible plot but after a while the constant stops become so tedious that you just give up.\n\n[ Had to edit the review because apparently the D word is censored, regardless of context. ]","February 18","false","1.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

It maybe helps if you are a fan of the sci-fi writer Philip K. D-i-c-k (thanks swear-word filter!), whose life and works inspired the game (and are alluded to within it). For example, PKD had all sorts of "interesting" ideas about parallel worlds, alternate realities, artificial intelligence, robots, and mind-alterting drugs/technologies.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple (find the Sigils and click on them -- that's basically it!), but the overall tone and theme are very engaging. There are clues to the location of the Sigils if you pay close attention to lighting and audio cues, or to apparent visual "glitches" (not all of which are bugs!). The art and music are excellent, and the "other world" portal effect is very nice too.\n\nCaveats: there *are* a few genuine bugs (dodgy collision etc.), and the only save-points are automatic ones at the start of each chapter.. so give yourself time to play a whole section in one sitting (each of the 3 main chapters takes about an hour to get through).","February 20","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It looks STUNNING when you first enter the game. ( thats what convinced me to give it a try from the store page ). Sadly thats about it. The actual "game play" consists of nothing but walking backwards and forwards and sideways to try and make "symbols" appear. If you are lucky you can click them before they disappear again otherwise you spend many many minutes trying to find the right camera position to make them reappear. you find how ever many are hidden in each location. Once you have found them all. You then jockey position to get the sybol that takes you to the next level to appear. Then its the same procedure AGAIN. Rinse and repeat. Oh and you can approach some very badly drawn inanimate cardboard cut out figures and an audio clip will play of their voices talking to you so you get bits of the story.

This game is that void, and when I eventually finish I'll need a new void.  This game is a visual art psychedilic trip.  There are times when The Mighty Boosh comes to mind.  Those unfamiliar with the style might not get where this game is coming from.  It isn't perfect.  I'd like to see more story and dialogue.  I'd like to see more secrets to explore, and stuff to manipulate.  It doesn't have as much humour and as many things to do as Jazzpunk.  The main part of the game involves finding "hidden objects" in a 3D setting, which I haven't quite seen done this way.  It's interesting that finding these objects opens up a parallel universe, and sometimes new areas (more of the new areas and less eye candy would be better).  I've noticed a lot of updates since release so there may be bugfixes that acknowledge some of what I've heard but not experienced yet myself.  Better game saves would be better.  I almost finished chapter 1 and quit thinking there whould have been checkpoints by then, but was reset to the beginning when I returned.

I would have caveats on that recommendation, and those are in the LBRIA (long but read it anyway) version below\n\n- I am a big fan of PKD. Some works inspired by him (take the novel "Philip K ♥♥♥♥ is Dead, Alas" for example) can be excellent and expand upon the PKD universe in interesting ways, almost existing as part of it. I didn't feel this game really did that though, to me it felt more like re-used ideas from his books and writings without any real expansion on them, which was a shame.\n\n- It also seemed to miss some of the charm and humour that fills a PKD novel.\n\n- Personally, I was a bit uncomfortable with the audio used in the end chapter, but to save on any sort of spoiler I won't discuss what that was. Those who know PKD's life will know what the audio represents.\n\n- I fell through a wall to ground level from the first floor, leaving the elevator I used to get there still up top. I could then enter a big open space behind where the elevator should have been - doing so triggered the elevator to come down, which promptly pushed me through the wall, trapping me between the wall, a desk and a door.\n\nThe kind of reality breakdown the game had not intended to include! I was disappointed that this relatively short, small, and fairly constrained game had bugs like that in it.\n\n- No saves. If you start a chapter, finish it, else you'll be back at the start when you come in again. This is particularly vexing if you get squeezed into a stuck situation by a glitched elevator, for example.\n\n- No explanation at the beginning! For those stuck, type the faded letters representing the ongoing story on the typewriter. For the rest of the game, I like that the mechanics weren't explained and it was a voyage of small discoveries, but it will leave people thinking it's crashed if you throw them in to a static screen with none of the expected keys doing anything right at the outset.\n\n- Very short, so keep that in mind if considering it. Doesn't seem to be much that would reward repeat playthroughs (based on having repeated some chapters due to the lack of saves ahem.)\n\n- The mixing of realities sure was neat though, as were the stories of each chapter. Just wish it had been developed further, personally.\n\n- The areas to explore are fairly limited, and the mechanics of the puzzles are too. Since it's short, that doesn't get old, but did leave me feeling like this could have been so much more!\n\n- If you like The Stanley Parable, you might like this too; though Stanley is more rewarding of repeat playthroughs, and manages to have more of the wry humour and wit that would have fitted in well here!","February 17","true","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This sums up my first 2h of gameplay.\n\nI couldn't locate further white triangles which isn't a too fascinating task after all. The "town" I could explore consisted of my apartment, a street, a record store I cannot enter, a snack bar, an upstairs office and a parkette. So, there was very little to explore and making no progress stopped me from continuing. Another major turn off is the fact you cannot save game within a "chapter".

But if you like surrealism and you're open to more "non-traditional" sorts of games, you'll likely have an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game does suffer a bit from what little gameplay it does have - you search around the environment finding hidden theta symbols that create bubbles of alternate reality, but some of them can be pretty difficult to find.

It is quite minimal in its gameplay and narrative, but in many ways it is a knowing and loving homage.

The themes are semaphored rather than fully developed, and I wouldn't say no to a more adventure-game treatment with a bit more depth, but I found the final chapter strangely moving and effective nonetheless, the music was a very nice touch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadioG/recommended/402060/","RadioG","RadioactiveGazz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadioG/","252 products in account","Claifornium is a very good walking simulator hidden behind a bad game. The environments are designed wonderfully, and exploring their differences in multiple dimensions is lovely. The story is intriguing, even if the script is a little bloated and lacking in good humour when the tone calls for it. But let it down is the game itself, as all of Californium’s best qualities are trapped behind crap easter-egg hunts. You must find a number of symbols in the environment to enact the changes to other dimensions, and the circumstances under which they appear are often frustratingly arbitrary. They aren’t really puzzles, because they don’t abide by consistent or compelling rules. They also don’t encourage exploration as much as they do reduce the wonderful environment to an irritating obstacle. Testing the player’s patience this way also makes it harder to look past the narrative shortcomings, where if story progress wasn’t punctuated by disgruntling games of hide-and-seek, I likely wouldn’t have been dissatisfied with it. This is born from a lack of confidence in the developer over the walking simulator genre. I believe they felt that the story and wandering alone wouldn’t make the game long enough, or enough like a game to satisfy people, so they put in things that make it more identifiable as a traditional game and pads out the game’s length at the same time. The result is a very interesting game that simply doesn’t value the player’s time, is frustrating over arbitrary things, and calls attention to all of its flaws, not just the crap symbol-finding. Walking simulators as interesting as this are rare, but when they do come along, they need to have the confidence of their developer to allow them to be short and sweet, and not waste the player’s time pretending to be a longer, more gamey product. I genuinely believe that the alternate-reality version of this game that is only an hour long is a much better game, and much more worthy of the price. We’re hitting a point in the gaming market where game length and mechanics are no longer the sum of what make games valuable to players. The components of the game I want are all here, and I hope the developers learn from this and step into the genre with more confidence next time.\nI recomend this, but only to people willing to grant this game more patience than it earns.","April 2","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The style is incredibly strong and original, the story is mindblowing and the suspense grabs you to the end and lets you breathless.\nThe gameplay does get a bit repetitive, but then you get better so it goes faster, and the narration is more and more present and takes the lead, so it's not a huge deal in my opinion.\n\nTo describe the game more precisely, it is a hidden-object, with suprising and surreallistic hints. The direction is very cinematographic, some kind of Aronofsky/Lynch-like, with a unique oppressively-warm color graphic style, and a very schizophrenic story à-la K. ♥♥♥♥.","April 28","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markzwaan/recommended/402060/","markzwaan","markzwaan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markzwaan/","2495 products in account","This game is inspired by the life and work of sci-fi author Philip K. ♥♥♥♥, who lived a large part of his life in California and battled with drug abuse. Many of his stories were written based on experiences he had while under the influence of drugs. The events that inspired 'A scanner darkly' seem to be the main inpiration of this game, but other recurring themes from his work such as paranoia, humans being replaced by androids and the existence of parallel universes are also present. The gameplay exists mainly out of walking around the authors neighbourhood, talking to various people and finding hidden sigils that will open up portals to another dimension. The games plot revolves around the author having to deal with the loss of his daughter, his wife leaving him and he himself having writers block and being unable to produce any meaningfull written material. Though it is never clearly stated it is heavely implied that the author is under the influence of drugs. The art style is gorgeous with highly saturated colours and relatively low polygon environments. Each alternate universe you'll travel to features a unique art style and has it's own back story which you'll uncover as you talk to the characters you'll meet. The stories in the alternate universe are interconnected and relate to the problems the main character is facing. The plot of the game is somewhat hard to follow because of the mental state of the main character and a lot is left to the imagination of the player. It's certainly not a game for everyone, just like the movie 'A scanner darkly' won't appeal to everyone. I enjoyed the experience despite some minor bugs and glitches. The main bugs have been worked out by the developers (like the game not properly saving your progress in a chapter) and I haven't experienced anything game breaking. The most annoying problem I've experienced is that sometimes dialogue from some of the characters I've met, was interrupted and this caused me to miss some of it.","May 7","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation is gorgeous! I love the art style and this shifting realities thing. But the game play itself is boring and very repetitive. There is basicially no game play... There is no failure state or anything. You walk around looking for symbols to click on which only aapear when you are on a certain position. There is no real interaction with NPCs. They just talk to you if you happen to be close. Unfortunately the game just fails to be clever, which would've been a cool gimmick.\n\nThe game is finished after about three hours or possibly less if you don't get stuck like I did. I got stuck a dozen times because the game doesn't really tell you what to do. I bought this game on sale for about half the price and I therefore enjoyed it as an entertaining experiment. I hope it inspires someone to take these ideas to make an actual game.","May 10","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

D ick, sci-fi writer I'm a huge fan of.  In the game you impersonate Elvis Green, a broke author near to mental collapse but somehow in contact with a super-entity (whose nature it's not clear: he may be a god, or an alien life form, or maybe a supertechnological device, who knows) named Theta. With his help you'll have to peel off, quite literally, the strata of reality to find the real world which lies beneath. The game is a sort of a puzzle game: every time you'll have to look for the hidden symbols which, once found, will permit you to scratch off the illusory reality. Now, coming to my opinion of the game, I found it terribly boring. The mechanism is repeated for all the game long, and becomes more boring and also annoying as you progress because the symbols are harder to find, being visible only from an extremely precise spot/angolation. Also, the characters you meet are quite useless, as you just have to listen to what they have to say without any possibility to interact with them. And for the world to explore it's more of the same: you just have to stick to the path designed, proceeding following a very rigid order of actions. All this prevented me to getting involved in the game setting. The only thing which I appreciated is the art design, but even this it's not really original.\n\nAll in all, a bad game.","May 11","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
