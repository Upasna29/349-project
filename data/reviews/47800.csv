( Maybe a fix if the developers read this)\n\nOverall definitily a must have if you are a Risk fan.\nYou won't be disappointed.\n\n","January 7","true","26.3"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","19","19","2","0"

It has too different modes: Risk & Risk Factions. Risk: Is the original game with no fancy art basic but still true to its routs. Risk Factions: Is a more dumbed down version which is alot more simple and adds a few additional features to the game. Such as objectives and stars from cards which add up to give you  a troop bonus.\n\nThis game is good to play with friends it makes it alot more interesting but does also destroy a few friendships for a couple of days which I found out. With friends this is perfect. With tactics and ruthlesness. If you betray your friend to win you have a few things going on .You either win or keep your friends. This game is a mix of Luck and Skill so be sure to use your brain when playing this game.\n\nFrom a solo point of view the multiplayer is not great and you very rarely will find a lobby let alone people who will play with you. There is a campaign but this annoyed me as the first level is a tutorial and talks you through alot even tho I knew how to play so I gave up. But if you are new to risk I would encourage you to play this first.\n\nThis game is really worth it and should be a good addition to your steam library. This is a must with friends and is a whole lot of fun. Whenever this is on sale try to encourage your friends to buy it. The more the merryier(up to 5 players). This game mixes RISK(pardon the pun) and reward. Really worth it!\n\n","June 22, 2015","true","17.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","0"

If so, you might actually like this game.\n\nIt's basically the classic game RISK, but the "Factions" version involves playing one of five different groups: humans, robots, cats, yetis and the undead.  The only differences are visual (i.e. no faction-based special attacks or anything), but it adds a lively -- and often quite amusing -- flourish to what some consider a boring game.  The classic version is available, as well.\n\nThe single player campaign is rather short, although the AI is cheap.  You can beat it eventually, but doing so relies more on luck than anything else.  Multiplayer is online or hot-seat.\n\nAll in all, it's an inexpensive strategy game that's easy to learn and visually more entertaining and accessible for those not normally inclined toward this genre.\n","October 4, 2011","true","22.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","12","12","2","0"

This game is an electronic version of the popular board game called RISK. You control armies across a board which features a vast amount of territories to control and capture.\n\nChoose to command one of the belligerents of the game such as the Feral cats, mighty British army, filthy undead, and Bill Gates robots. Not one of these has advantages over the other which allows a fair game. Though, if you really want to be unfair and have the upper hand, certain territories feature special add-ons for your territory allowing bonuses to come into effect.\n\nThese bonuses can range from placing airfields, artillery pieces, and an assortment of other bonuses which provide extra damage during the engagement process.\n\nMass huge armies by placing counters on territories and send them to wipe out everyone across the globe, capturing more territory as you go, allowing more income counters for troops. This game is extremely fun played with others and you will have a blast. The back-story for the four races in the game is rather humorous and well made.

I had another review and played it a bit more and changed my mind.  The RNG is horrable.  It is crazy streaky to rediculousness.  I mean how many times in a row will 2 die come up with the same number?  Try 9 times.  While that is the most I have happen, streaks for like 4 or 5 are not uncommon.\n\nTo make matters worse, is that it has a die rolling animation that is super slow.  You need to watch this with EACH DIE ROLL.  Huge stacks take forever.  There was some kind of quick thing, but it stopped doing that and I have no idea how to do faster rolls.  The UI is also kind of buggy, perhaps the dissapearance of the fast rolling is part of that.  The AI is pretty stupid as well.\n\nThe extra game modes do not add anything, as thier special rules are quite "broken".  IE: There is the temple thing you can control that you can use once per turn that will not just kill an entire stack, but actually change the stack to your guys.  Someone just dropped a stack of 32 guys?  Thanks, Ill take those, they are mine now.  Of course the AI doesn't realise the god power here and just summons giant stacks for you to possess.  That is when it is not flooding its own stacks (another map feature) and killing its own men.","November 25, 2013","false","5.6"," 29 of 53 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","29","53","0","1"

It was always one of those games that I saw and heard a lot about, but never quite got around to the stage of persuading people to sit around a table and play it. With RISK: Factions on steam, this problem is eliminated. If you have no clue whatsoever on how to play the game, this will give you a nice crash course, though the rules it offers with the Factions element are a lot more simplified than the normal rules. They also make the gameplay a lot faster.\n\n\nIt can be fiddly working with the faster drag and release methods to speed up troop fights. You can either watch fights happen, including each painstaking dice roll, or just speed through them. Sometimes it doesn't always work when selecting and choosing – and with smaller territories they can be hard to highlight. I've had quite a few incidents where I wanted to invade a specific territory, and it took me 20 or so tries before the area finally got highlighted.\n\n\nThe main campaign mode is designed basically to give you the rules on this version of the game, and introduce you to five “leaders” who each have their quirks. You also get the option to have the classic RISK map without the added faction goodies, a classic RISK map with them thrown in, and a faster win method, or utilising maps that showed throughout the campaign, with their specific objectives. You can control one of five leaders: McGutterpants, Generalissmo Meow, His Excellency, Gary, Commandant SixFour, or Colonal Stiffenberg, You can either take objectives on the map for extra bonuses within game, such as an enemy city or capital, or achieve something such as taking over 5 territories in one turn -- to gain advantages over the rest. I can guarantee RNG will annoy you a lot. It can be depressing to see your 10 troops fail to take over an country with only 2 troops defending. Such is the way of the RNG Gods.\n\n\nThe graphics are cartoonish and comical in nature. The faction leaders are funny, with their own animations and expressions for when they attack, lose land, and gain land. The maps themselves are easy to follow, and quite bright.\n\n\nThe music is alright, there's nothing I would find outstanding about it – same with the voice acting tailored to the faction leaders.\n\n\nThere's nothing particularly special about this game, but if you want to play RISK, learn the rules, and be able to play with friends online, then this is definitely worth some of your hours.\n\n\nWant moar?

Well, dont get me wrong, its a good game overall. The multiplayer is dead, if you dont have anyone to play with then all you are going to do is finish the campaign and play 2-3 missions on Custom mode. Thats pretty much it, it doesn't have much going for it. The objectives are great and all, the animations are halirous and the cutscenes will give you a laugh or two, but the game doesn't have that original RISK feeling. If you are a fan of RISK and you have nothin' to do, sure, why not? I'd say you can finish the campaign in around 2-3 hours minimum, and the Custom mode is great. It will kill some hours and then you will probably never touch it again.\n\nMeh 3/5, would bang.","July 20, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The computer regularly had rolls that favored it enormously while also generating highly improbable rolls to disadvantage the player. I don't mind a challenge, but at least have that challenge based in the strategy of the AIs rather than obvious cheating.\n\n3. Poorly designed user interface.

I like all the extra stuff, the various 'things' that you can capture to change the way the game plays.  The writing is humorous.  It's Risk plus a bit more.\n\nAnd then the problems.  The campaign was...an introduction to the various factions.  That's it.  You didn't get to pick sides.  You simply got to play as the new faction.  But what's different about each faction?  The animations and the color!  That's it.  It's RISK so I really don't ask for the factions to have different powers.  But the animations.  They're cute, they're funny, I think they're well done...until you've witnessed them for the 100th time.  You can make the dice go faster...by giving up the dice all together and committing fully to the attack.  Tired of the slow animations that were fun and cute for the first couple hours?  Well, you can speed up the animation where the computer takes over territories (that's the ONLY animation that speeds up when you hit fast forward).  Tired of that same message that says "cities help your ability to draft new soldiers"?  Too bad.  The game will remind you EVERY TIME YOU TAKE A TERRITORY WITH A CITY, duh, you're obviously too dumb to've got it the first 50 times it told you.  ^_^\n\nSo I got tired of the aniimations.  I'll play Classic RIsk!  I thought.  How could they screw that up?  That's been done before.  All the rules and the standard variat...oh, there are no variations... fine.  Aaaaaaaand then I get gang ♥♥♥♥♥.  I understand.  I get it.  I don't win Risk all the time.  But when I lose, because one of the AIs turns in three sets of cards, three turns in a row, and then...I'm still alive...I have a set...it's the draft phase but I CAN'T TURN IN THE SET because the game lagged (single player) and I clicked on the card menu, which closed the card menu...but then I open it back up and can't turn it in?  ♥♥♥♥ you Risk Factions.  ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nOh, and the actual game controller controls are not properly reflected on the screen.  Really?  The developer can't even get the controls to be properly reflected on the screen?\n\nSo to summarize:  This game is like that pretty guy or girl that you've just scored a date with.  They're fun, they're fantastic, they seem to be everything you want.  That little thing they do that annoys you, that's no big deal--until you discover that there are a lot of those "little things that annoy you"  I do think it's almost worth the $10 I paid for it.  I certainly got two or three good hours of enjoyment out of it--but I can't recommend it.  It seems like a solid game until you get under the hood and check it out.","April 6, 2014","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Better said, this game has one of the worst rng factors I've ever stumbled across. Yeah I know, happens in real life risk too, but no one plays the game online anymore, so you'll only have the AI to play against. And this is where the ridiculous rng happens. Ever lost with 15 units against 1 pc unit rolling 10x 6 in a row? Yeah that's fun! Another example: I just lost a game because of only getting 1 card set done (right in the beginning for 6 units) the three AI enemies could each complete a card set every three turns two times in a row. It ended with me having 4 countries 3 units each against AI opponents each controlling a continent. But they didn't decide to weaken each other to deny their continent bonuses, but somehow they decided to crush themselves in North America. In the end I managed to conquer South America and then suddenly they decided to deny my bonuses.\n\nTL;DR: Everytime you get realistic chances at winning the game, all AI opponents will leap on you together. When done, they will continue doing their thing. + bad rng dice rolls\n\nIf some of you are interested in my rolls:\n\n1: 854\n2: 849\n3: 827\n4: 803\n5: 826\n6: 769\n\n1:6 deviation: +9%, 2:5 deviation: -10%, 3:4 deviation: -10,3%\nAfter this amount of rolls it should start to get to zero deviation, but no.","June 19, 2015","false","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
