I'm a huge fan of visual novels and anime, and usually, I don't particularly mind if a port is a little rough around the edges. However, with "Mind Zero", Aksys Games don't even have the bare basics down. The game is locked at the internal PS Vita resolution, with no option to adjust it. You can run it in full screen, but that will just scale it, making it quite a blurry mess. Moreover, some people on the forums have been complaining about their controllers not being recognized -- meaning you will eventually have to resort to third-party tools (e.g. Xpadder) to fix that.\n\nAlso, if you're like me and prefer to play most games via -- God forbid -- KB + mouse setup, don't even bother, as Aksys have failed to implement even basic mouse functionality. By default, you need to control analog stick movement via some arbitrarily assigned keys. If that doesn't float your boat: Hey, no problem, you can, as I randomly found out, use the mouse to navigate the map and menus, you just need to hold down the left mouse button the entire time. Sounds like fun, right? Of course (this is a port 'classic'), the game will ALWAYS show controller button prompts, regardless of your input method. Which means you're in for fun times, when the game asks for "A", but means "Y", asks for "Y", but means "S", and so forth.\n\nOverall, the game itself looks interesting enough, so if you own a PS Vita you may want to track down a copy for cheap. But stay away from this port -- especially if you plan to play via KB + mouse.\n\nIf you're looking for a visual novel boasting great art style and story, which is also competently ported, I wholeheartedly recommend "Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc"! "Xblaze Code: Embryo" is entertaining, too and a surprisingly solid port, considering that it's also published by Aksys.","March 8","false","1.0"," 183 of 228 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","183","228","6","7"

It seems similar to Persona, and there seems to be some promise there, but there is so much getting in the way.\n\nI had to randomly hit keys to figure out how to get to the settings menu (the Z key is your A button, btw) where I could find the rest of the keys.  The fullscreen option did not apply right away, and only showed up after a restart.\n\nThe 'transitions' between scenes are just a fade out and fade in on the same bg way too often, there is way too little context for what is going on in the scenes so that it's really hard to picture what is going on.\n\nOn the plus side, it seems decently voice acted.  Woo.\n\nMy no vote comes from the fact that once I was ready to quit, I couldn't.  It was stuck in fullscreen mode, to the point that ctl-alt-del did just about nothing.  More random key mashing led to steam eventually launching one of my other games that didn't have focus.  So yeah, that's an issue.  I don't want to have to hold down my power button every time I want to quit.\n\ntl;dr  Even $15 feels a bit much for this game.  It's really bare bones.","March 8","false","2.4"," 75 of 106 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","75","106","4","3"

Whilst the mechanics aren't staggeringly original, there's a nice balance in how much you're prepared to spend for the bigger skills, and each fight can reward you with bonuses depending on how you fought, which can encourage certain tactical choices you'd otherwise dismiss.  The character art is good, in a Visual Novel style, and the splash CGs are well done.  Voice acting is very good and there's a lot of it, and the story is intriguing even if you have to suspend your disbelief significantly.\n\nHowever....\n\nThe negatives are too much.  First and foremost, this is a dreadful, lazy port.  I feel bad for giving money to something that shows such little evidence of any effort.  Resolution is locked at the original PSVita resolution as far as I can tell (960x544) even in full screen, making it look like an PS2-era game, full of jagged edges and obvious pixels.  Textures are blurred and low-res, especially in the dungeon corridors.  Sound quality is a hit-and-miss affair, with odd stereo placement and volume issues abounding, and the title song sounds like it was recorded onto an old magnetic cassette tape by sticking a microphone next to a radio speaker. Load times are excessive and make *zero* use of the memory that PCs can provide over the Vita.  Dungeon exploration involves significant and inexplicable lag and input-delay.  Elements of the touch-screen interface of the original remain, such as slashing barriers or pushing levers, and are replaced - without informing you - with mouse interactions.  However, no other aspect of the game will be controlled with the mouse... you have to use the awkward keyboard controls. They've replaced the Vita original button icons with Xbox Gamepad button icons, and then failed to implement a way to use the XBox Gamepad to actually play the game!\n\nHonestly, it's just shocking.\n\nI want to like it.  I really do.  There's a solid dungeon-crawl experience in there that's trying to claw it's way out.  But as it stands, unless Zerodiv/Aksys are prepared to listen to people and make the necessary changes to this port, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.","March 12","false","12.6"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","2"

When you get hit, it is literally the enemy attacking you characters picture.\nSkills seem wonky and explanations even more so.\n\nIn short I got this game in hopes of it being a sort of Persona for PC, however calling it a 'Persona clone' is thus far feeling like an insult to Persona and for the price tag, i must admit I am feeling somewhat jipped. I understand its a port but looking at P3 portable....this could have been better. WAY better. I use the SCP wrapper in order to use my ps3 controller with the game so it feels a little more fluent....until you get to dungeon 'navigation' if you want to call it that. That being said im not knocking the game, the story is very rich and it is whats so far driving me to play the game. If you dont care for graphics which i know alot of people dont and just want a persona like visual novel if give it a try. But eh....wait for a steam sale. It isnt worth 20 bucks. Or even 15 at the 20% off in my very personal opinion. I would like to hope there would be patches to make this PC worthy and not for it to remain a port but....it's more than likely a dream that will be forever embedded in my Sad little mind. If you want Persona.....just....Play persona.","March 10","false","2.3"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

Outside of the resolution stuff that others have brought up, this is a fine port. The game itself is super underrated, unfortunately (and unfairly) being compared to Persona.

I'm 80% through the game and here are my thoughts.\n\nI originally greenlite this game because I hoped to feel the rollercoaster of emotions that I experienced when I first played  Persona 3. Sadly, Mind Zero pales in comparison to any game of the Shin Megami Tensei series.\n\nMy problem with this game is that they tried hard to copy the Persona series but failed to emulate its writing, character development, and gameplay. In short, the story is rather a blander version of P3, with the MC gathering a crew to fight a evil gang of Minders. There's even a small sub plot in which a character overcomes her fears to accept the mind she formed a contract with, just like in the Persona series. Each character is hastily developed and the story jumps around a lot. The protagonist literally meets some random dude and immediatley forms an alliance with him to close doorways that spawn monsters. I think I read less than a hour of plot for the 20 hours of grinding I needed to do to fight the bosses.\n\nGameplay  revolves around first-person dungeon crawling that is iconic to traditional RPGs, with the player finding loot in chests and fighting a boss in each dungeon. Plot is usually advanced after defeating each dungeon boss and the player has opportunities to accept requests (side quests) and view side plots. Requests are mostly pointless unless you want the steam achievement. Most of the challenges have you fighting weaker enemies that yield lower exp due to level scaling. The rewards, with the ex skills exception, are usually weaker than your current equipment.\nThe tp mechanic (mana subsitute) in this game punishes upgrading and enhancing skills, which was the only unique customization aspect of this game. Since each character is stuck with a max of 10 tp and earns 2 tp per turn if he/she defends, it takes a long time to cast high level skills, which can cost 6-8. I can use 3 t2 spells  and do 900 damage or use 2 t3 spells and do 800 in the same amount of turns. When you defend, your also without the protection of your mind (is that what those things are called?) so you take direct damage to your health. Late game, bosses and some mobs can easily one-shot you through the bonus defence you recieve.\n\nMusic and sfx has promise but is ruined in the port. Everything is too loud and low qualility. Voice-acting somehow survived and is excellent.\n\nOverall I don't recommend this game unless your really into traditional RPGs. You'll probably quickly tire of the endless grinding and generic gameplay.\n\n","March 23","false","29.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is so earily similar to the Persona series, that I would definitely believe it to be made by the same people if you told me that.\nBut from what I can say, the port of this game from Vita to PC seems to be a bit rushed, having a few minor issues graphically, and only one resolution. Also the game starts in windowed mode, which is extremely unexpected, and the whole game was made to be played with an xbox controller, so all of the prompts are for xbox controls, but of course, you CAN play with keyboard as I am.\n\nFrom what I can see, this game may be interesting if you like the first person dungeon crawling of Persona, but so far I haven't seen that much of a unique reason to go for it. It takes about an hour to get finished with the tutorial of the game, so it's definitely a bit slow, and throws a lot of exposition at you through dialogue.\n\nIf you would like to hear more about how I feel for the game, please check out my lets play if you get the chance.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buz7FxlcbCY","March 9","true","2.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"
