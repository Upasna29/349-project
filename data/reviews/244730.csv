People liked the idea of the joke, and the simple game became a much more complicated game and was given a $10 price tag.\n\nDivekick is full of in-jokes and references that most casual gamers will miss.  The game itself is somewhat tiring, limiting how often people are willing to play.  Design-wise, balance appears to be handled through counter-picking rather than attempting to make all match-ups even.  For a $10 game, it is fairly no frills.  As a $10 game, it is overpriced.\n\nNOTE: It is possible that Iron Galaxy Studios have abandoned this game.  A 2014 update introduced an issue where the game crashes during Redacted's story mode, which has yet to be fixed as of May 23, 2015.  The game's non-Steam forum, where a pinned Steam topic sends people with support issues, is overrun by spambots.  A Steam post on December 25, 2014 acknowledges both the crash bug as well as the spam issue, stating that everyone was on vacation for the holidays, and that both issues would be looked at when they returned.  Five months later, the crash bug remains and the non-Steam forums remain overrun by spambots.","May 23, 2015","false","0.7"," 135 of 179 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","135","179","3","0"

Everyone loves fighting games, right?\n\nNo.  Not everyone.  But why?\n\nThe fact of the matter is that for most fighting games the barrier to entry is complexity.  Players must learn about each of the characters, how to perform special techniques, and master precision combinations on a six-button layout just to be able to compete.\n\nDivekick throws all the rules out the door and introduces simple yet absurd gameplay.  The madness begins with a simple premise: there are no movement controls, and there are only two buttons: Dive and Kick.  Pressing Dive makes the player dive into the air, and pressing Kick while in the air causes the player to kick downward towards the opponent.  Pressing the Kick button while on the ground causes the player to jump backward away from the opponent.  These are the only ways to move around the arena.  All divekicks are one hit kills.  The first to five kills wins.\n\nNot exactly what you would expect, huh?\n\nWhat if I told you that it’s one of the most engrossing fighting games released in the past five years?\n\nIn a time when fighting games regularly introduce complexity, it’s refreshing to see a game that breaks fighting games down to the bare essentials; strategy.  None of the 13 characters, each of whom dive and kick differently, are severely overpowered.  There are  no long combos to memorize, no comeback super techniques.  With no complexity, all that’s left is mind games; the ability to fake out your opponent, the rush of emotion when a plan is executed and comes together flawlessly.\n\nWhile Divekick is generally understood to be a parody of the fighting game genre, it also unearths concepts that have been buried under layers of complexity for too long and brings the genre back around full circle.  Divekick cannot be recommended enough for any fighting game enthusiast willing to try something nice and silly..","November 25, 2013","true","233.1"," 93 of 120 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","93","120","0","1"

You may not immediately click with its unique parody of fighting games and general poking fun at the fighting game community, but at the very least, you'll probably be pretty good at Divekick by the end of your first match due to its elegance in simplicity.\n\n1 Dive Button.\n1 Kick button.\n1 hit and you're dead.\n5 rounds won and you're godlike.\n1 hell of a good time.\n\nThat's all you really need to know to get started playing Divekick. Jumping and kicking moves you forward and pressing the kick button while on the ground hops you backward, which can  you can also attack during. You couldn't ask for something more approachable.\n\nDivekick's depth comes from managing the space between you and your opponent and trying to outwit one another to land that crucial winning blow. All thirteen characters have unique kick angles and characteristics that are suited for beginners (Dive and Kick) all the way up to characters that require a lot of skill and patience (S-Kill and Stream).  All special moves in the game are activated by pressing both buttons at once on the ground or in the air. It's just up to you to figure out how to best utilize them.\n\nMultiplayer is what makes Divekick truly shine. While the AI can be good for getting to know your character a bit, the game's honestly a much better affair when paired with other players either online or locally. The implementation of GGPO keeps matches online mostly silky smooth, though the lack of a proper 4-8 player lobbies is a bit of a bummer.\n\nEven if Divekick is targeted at folks who love their fighting games, its simplistic approach, low skill barrier for entry, and lighthearted nature make it easily recommendable and enjoyable for anyone simply looking to have a good time.","August 26, 2013","true","20.7"," 115 of 156 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","115","156","2","0"

Things like Evo Moment 37 and MAHVEL BAYBEE have been ingrained into Internet culture through osmosis, and while I've never been super into, let alone GOOD at them, I have always admired the passion that the players put into their game(s) of choice.\n\nDivekick is a perfect embodiment of all that energy fans put behind the fighting game scene.  The brilliant Kickstartervideos, the silly convention floor demos, the giant two button fight sticks made specifically for the game, and even the game itself all carry that thrill of the fight.  Many of the characters and a good portion of the dialog for the various storylines all reference fighting game culture.  There are characters based on trolls, players, developers, and even canceled characters from other major fighting game franchises.  The game even buys into the whole "guest character" feature ala Soul Calibur and Smash (and probably like 10 other franchises, but remember, I'm not big on fighting games!).  Johnny Gat of Saints Row fits right in with the absurdity of Divekick universe, and the new character trailer for Nidhogg's "The Fencer" is a Smash Bros character intro in everything but name.\n\nSpeaking of the Divekick universe, Iron Galaxy has built such a silly, lulzy lore to tie this whole concept together.  Fighting in this world revolves around combinations of kicking and diving (like, literally their legs are so powerful they can push themselves off the planet and up into the air).  Mechanically, there are only two buttons, the gameplay is super simplified but still carries  with it quite the meta.  Characters are diversified through different angles of attack for diving and kicking, and select characters have additional moves like changing angle in flight, usually at the cost of a movement penalty or something to that effect.  The game also employs gems you can set before playing to boost your diving/kicking/meter and some other gameplay modifiers.\n\nThe two button mechanic is so basic, but the stakes are just as high as any round of Tekken I've ever played.  If you share a love for fighting games, or just want some really silly writing with really silly characters (there's a guy who wears boots on his hands so he can "kick" with his hists), you'd be kicking yourself for not taking a dive into your wallet to buy this game.\n\nPuns.","December 12, 2015","true","5.0"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","30","35","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/244730/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","It’s all about that one moment. Everyone who’s ever played or watched a fighting game knows it. It’s the final round, both players have a slither of health left and the next move is pivotal; the difference between success and failure, win or lose. Whether it’s playing against a friend, competing in an online ranked match or watching one of the many tournament streams of the fighting game community, everyone knows that one moment. It’s the veritable height of tension, excitement, elation and anguish. Divekick is that one moment distilled into an entire game. Each round of every single fight captures the thrill of those final few seconds in a tightly-contested bout; the moment that entices newcomers to the genre and sends diehard fans into mass hysteria. And it’s all accomplished with only two buttons.\n\nWhat started out as a simple concept featuring two near-mechanically identical characters and a staple move of 2D fighting games, has now evolved to feature a roster of thirteen that surprises with its hidden depth. It’s odd to say that a game with only two buttons has any intricacy, but therein lies Divekick’s beauty. With one button to jump and one to kick it’s easily accessible for newcomers to the genre. Rounds are a quick twenty seconds and each fight’s nine possible rounds will end after one single hit. It’s the fighting game condensed to its purest form, sans any barrier to entry and welcoming to those dumbfounded and put off by the commitment required to learn the inner workings of the genres best. It’s a test of reads and reactions, of tactically positioning yourself based on your character’s idiosyncrasies and those of your opponent.\n\nYou simply jump and divekick, launching through the air to knock your opponent down in their stride.The characters of Dive and Kick showcase this concept at its base level, adopting the roles of Ken and Ryu (even if they are parodies of Yun and Yang) in Divekick’s outlandish universe with the most easy-to-grasp attacks. Positioning is determined by how high you jump and the angle of your kick. Press the kick button when your feet are on the ground and you hop backwards; kick enough and your super meter fills, how you use it depends on your fighter selection. These are simple systems and mechanics that welcome the uninitiated, removing the need to mesmerise button combos. Anyone can pick up Divekick and immediately start having fun, and it’s certainly at its best when played with friends, either locally or online.\n\nHowever, there is an ever present complexity underpinning this apparent simplicity. Venture away from Dive and Kick and you’ll encounter characters with variations on the simple divekick. The Baz, for example, doesn’t defeat his opponents with his kick but with a trail of lightning that follows it. He can also pause mid-air and alter the angle of his kick, making him very effective if you can adjust to the peculiar way he deals damage. Other characters, like Jefailey, change from round to round. With each win his head begins to grow as his ego inflates, allowing you to jump higher while subsequently increasing the likelihood of suffering a critical headshot that leaves you concussed in the next round, drastically reducing the height of your jumps and the speed of your kicks. Dr Shoals, on the other hand, can perform a trajectory altering kick during her initial attack.\n\nEach of Divekick’s thirteen characters adopt their own unique move lists, terrifically setting them apart from one another. That philosophy continues as you begin to experiment with each fighter’s singular special moves. As you build up the super meter via kicking you can either exert it by using Kick Factor (a parody of Marvel vs Capcom 3’s X-Factor that speeds up your character for a limited time) or by using your special moves. Each character has a ground move and an air move that can be activated by pressing both buttons at once provided you have enough meter. These range from the ability to temporarily float in the air to avoid dangerous situations or to set-up divekicks of your own, to a shoryuken-style Upkick and a handy duck. Though each character shares the same two buttons it quickly becomes apparent how diverse they each are, drawing an improbable amount of depth out of its simple control scheme.\n\nOf course, this welcome complexity does contradict the notion that Divekick is incredibly easy to pick-up-and-play for newcomers to the fighting genre. There’s certainly an amount of explanation required whenever someone new picks a different character and wants to learn their many quirks, but Divekick handily subsides this somewhat with a story mode for each fighter. The AI is a tad on the easy side but these fights offer up a way to learn each character’s move list whilst unearthing their back stories via a handful of short motion comics.\n\nOnce you begin to play competitively against other people Divekick’s appeal is at its most discernible. Whether you’re playing locally with friends for a laugh or displaying your high-level skills in a ranked match, Divekick’s mechanics and use of basic fighting game concepts translate well to any environment. Some may write it off because of its simplistic control scheme and visual style but they would be missing the point. It may have slightly deviated from its original design to welcome the uninitiated to the genre – the many, many knowing references reveal a game that’s meant for the fighting game community more than anyone else – but the added depth proves welcome, even if it requires a little more understanding. Divekick is still all about that one moment, there’s just a little more nuance along the way.","January 22","true","13.1"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","25","28","3","0"

Well, it only has two buttons. Yes, you read that correctly, just two. No directional inputs, no macros, none of that. Just a button to jump (Dive) and a button to descend with a kick (Kick). You can also jump backwards if you press kick You even navigate the game menus just by using those two buttons as well. This game is just about diving and kicking, and every hit is an instant K.O. Divekicks, for those who never played fighting games, are a mechanic that some characters have in some already established fighting game franchises, and are usually seen as a great technique for any character who possesses them.\n\nDespite having very simple gameplay mechanics, the game is surprisingly deep and varied, and being just a two button fighter, anyone can get into it easily. Each of the 13 characters, who are parodies of other fighting game characters and personalities from the FGC (Fighting Game Community), has its own jump height and kicking speed and angle. Like most fighting games nowadays, it also has a meter, which can be used in different ways. Each character has a different Ground ability and an Air ability, activated by pressing both buttons in ground and air respectively. Some abilities can even work together, like Kung Pao's Ground ability, which creates a sort of dimensional crack above herself, which she can then use to teleport through using her Air ability. Each ability's cost depends on the character as well, which ends up adding even more variety to this game. Also, when you fill up your meter, Kick Factor automatically activates (if you ever played Marvel vs. Capcom 3, this mechanic might sound familiar to you). Kick Factor basically powers up your character's diving and kicking for a limited period of time. And to add even more variety, before every match you must choose one of 4 gems (a parody of Street Fighter X Tekken's gems), which powers up by 10% either your Dive, your Kick, your Meter gain, or a 30% boost for all 3 of them with the painful cost of beginning the game with 4 rounds already lost.\n\nLike I mentioned before, every hit is a one hit K.O. (each hit does 1 BILLION DAMAGE), so each match is a first to 5 20-second rounds in order for matches to have some length. It has a very creative way to solve timeouts, making a red vertical line appear at a random point in the stage, and when time runs out, the character who is closer to the line wins the round. It has a simple story mode, with a final boss that can be unforgiving even in normal difficulties. Unfortunately I can't comment on the online, but it uses GGPO, so netcode must be good. Being from where I am, finding an opponent in ranked matches has been impossible for me so far XD.\n\nVoice acting is one of the things that I think is unimpressive about this game. I know this isn't a major detail, but some characters' voices are not cool, and can sometimes feel even a bit annoying. Also, if you do not belong to the FGC, you probably won't understand most of the jokes in this game, but maybe that's not a bad thing. If anything, curiosity in those jokes might want you to get into the FGC. I also feel that there's too much FGC-related stuff going on in this game. Some of it is a bit unnecessary in my opinion. All in all, I think this game does not excel in the comedy department. Music is decent as well. Not too complicated tracks for a not too complicated game is a perfect fit the way I see it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo sum up, Divekick is a unique and very interesting take on the fighting genre, one where anyone can get in and have fun at any moment, while also being a big (sometimes too big) love letter to the FGC. It's no Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat, but the depth and variety hidden within its seemingly simple gameplay might surprise you. And with its very low cost, it's a game that can't be missed.\n\nA fighting game that can cater to basically any kind of gamer, in one way or another, is an amazing accomplishment.\n\nThis is a fighting game for everyone.","November 29, 2013","true","10.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

It subverts expectations by whittling the notoriously complex movesets of the fighting genre down to two simple maneuvers: diving and kicking. The result is engaging – after only a few rounds of combat, I was able to feint, dodge, and fake out my opponent with gratifying precision. Peel away the colorful artwork, and Divekick closely resembles the best of classic arcade fighter design philosophy. The goals and interface are instantly comprehensible, bouts are quick,\nDivekick\nAUGUST 20, 2013\nDivekick distills the essence of the fighting genre into a two-button, no-joystick, rage-inducing form that can be enjoyed by anyone.\n→ MUCH MORE\nJARED PETTY SAYS\nFriendly fighters\nPersona 4 ArenaBlazBlue: Calamity TriggerSuper Street Fighter IV and the pacing is snappy. Practice and experimentation are tangibly rewarded by skill development. Divekick has no dull tutorial or five-minute story interludes, just fighting, an occasional dumb joke, and more fighting.\nA diverse cast of characters infuse Divekick with a variety of special abilities without overly complicating matters. I found something to appreciate in every one of the 13 warriors, but I kept coming back to Uncle Sensei, a cartwheeling hippie wearing boots on his hands. The nearly horizontal angle of his full-body Divekick extension leaves him vulnerable, but it frequently beguiled my opponents, creating an intriguing risk vs. reward proposition.\nDivekick’s humor varies between cute and bizarre, and occasionally it goes too far. There are gobs of in-jokes about fighting-game tournament culture, staples, and tropes, as well as less obscure comedic one-liners. Some of the visual gags are quite funny – I laughed out loud the first time I watched one of the fighters writing notes on her clipboard while divekicking through the air, immediately before her foot impacted on my face.\nLess successful is the tongue-in-cheek commentary on racial prejudice. Mr. N’s announcement that “I don’t hug white girls” might make sense to folks familiar with personalities in the fighting-game circuit, but stripped of context it just comes across as unsettling and offensive. The ill-advised naming of Asian martial artist Kung Pao also strikes a distasteful chord.\nThe Vita version has a remarkable competitive two-player mode. My first local Divekick match took place in an IGN hallway on a single handheld, where I held half of the Vita and my opponent held the other half. I expected the layout to be awkward, but was pleasantly surprised to find it quite ergonomic. I could easily envision two friends on a train or kids sharing the back seat on a road trip going at it. It can, of course, also be played online, and my experiences on PS3, Vita, and PC were nearly free of latency.\n\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nDivekick is a deep, refreshingly approachable tournament fighter. The unusual control configuration is no gimmick, but rather a functional design choice that helps tear down the barrier of entry for players intimidated by combo breakers and juggling. It is unfortunate that there’s not a better single-player mode, and more unfortunate that Divekick’s cultural insensitivity can be downright cringe-worthy, but it’s still a successful experiment in simplified fighting.","July 29, 2014","true","6.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

The stuff that would irritate you because you would somehow always get kicked by them constantly even when you knew how to fight in the game.\n\nEach character has a humorous storyline to go through in single player mode which can bring some laughs. The game is played with only using two buttons and whoever gets the higher kick or faster kick wins the match. There are some who say the game has a lot of strategy but I just don’t see it that way.\n\nThere’s also an online mode and local mode to play but I didn’t bother with either since I didn’t care much for the single player portion. I wasn’t really fond of the game when it was announced and that feeling didn’t change after playing it. It’s a novelty game making fun of players who would constantly jump kick through the whole fight. Some of the character designs were funny along with their names but that only last for a short time.\n\nOnly way I could recommend this game is if you got it for free or dirt cheap. Its novelty wears off fast and reading around it sounds like the online has pretty much died.\n\nBear Rating: 3/10","January 26, 2014","false","2.6"," 41 of 73 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","41","73","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adamizuki/recommended/244730/","Adamizuki","MonkeyKingHero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Adamizuki/","371 products in account","Dive kick is quite simply one of the most fun and interesting games I have played this year and while for the most part I would love to leave it there I just cannot do so. Dive kick is one of those games that appears once every so often out of the blue and is possibly one of the fun and simplest games I have ever ha the joy of playing in my lifetime. The games developers Iron Galaxy studios are well known for their ports of popular gaming franchises to consoles and PC's including the soon to be port of Borderlands 2 for the PS Vita and developing the lacklustre game 'Wreckateer' for the Xbox 360s arcade.\n\nDive kick is a fighting game to its core with the simple premise of knocking out an opponent with a twist-- you must jump into the air and hurl yourself towards the opponent to DIVEKICK them to win the match using just two buttons for jumping into the air and dive kicking your opponent. Rounds end quite quickly with a typical match lasting between 2-5 minutes long and for the most part it becomes a frantic battle to try and stay as high in the air compared to your opponent in hopes of getting them off their guard, that is not to say however that Dive Kick has no skill involved. I found myself trying to outsmart my opponent by various different tactics such as; standing still and waiting the psyche out my opponent, however in the air, going for make and break by instantly jumping and diving for a quick kill and more.\n\nBefore you start a match you are introduced to a variety of characters each with their own stories and unique abilities which allow for higher jumps, faster kicks and in some cases even slight hovers. After the characters and skins have been chosen you are then given a new option to choose a gem which act as the games help for your character... most of the time. There are some gems that are there purely for either fun or a means to show off! I am talking of course about the YOLO gem, a gem which gives the opposite player a 4 round lead only needing to dive kick the opponent once to win. I found myself most of the time choosing YOLO gem to challenge myself, to see if it was possible to actually win but I could never succeed.\n\nMy first impressions of DiveKick were quite literally this: What? I can play a fighting game without learning ridiculously hard to pull of combos, anyone can jump into it and know exactly what they need to do to win and it's fun to play? Where do i sign up!? Because that is what it really is, a game which anyone can play without having any prior knowledge of what the game is about or what they need to do. It is a game that brings people together for a forgotten sense of whimsical enjoyment and fun that seems lost in many fighting games lately and is a game which relies on playing tactically and biding your time and not knowing more than the other person and being able to pull off a move without your opponent screaming 'how did you do that?! that's a clear advantage!'\n\nSadly however the game is not as much fun by yourself and should be primarily played with other people either locally or online. That is, if you can connect to someone to play with in the first place. I found myself waiting for long periods of time to finally find a person to play against during the launch week of the game and ended up just turning the game off all together, unplugging my console and going over to a friend's house to play it with them instead.\n\nIt must be stated however that Dive Kick is fun, there is no question about it. It's a game that brings together the enjoyment of playing together with friends and is a simple idea done right. Dive kick should be a title picked up by everyone and anyone who has a PC or PS3/Vita. Dive kick gets my sphere score of a 8/10 for its sheer replay-ability, hilarious characters and great system. Kudos Iron Galaxy Studios and the team behind Dive kick! I am here hoping for DLC/Dive Kick 2!","November 26, 2013","true","1.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I'm sure most of you know what I mean. A game that was originally a joke, has only two buttons, and technically doesn't offer the full fighting game experience. HOWEVER, and yes it must be caps, Divekick is a wonderful fighting game! The gameplay is fast and tactical. Fights are very match-up based, but don't count out skill. Yes there is strategy, and yes skill does matter. Reaction time, knowing the character you're up against, and personal play-style are all very important factors. At a glance, this looks like a game you could pass on. I was worried I'd play it for five minutes and be done with it. Yet I find myself smiling and laughing all the time while playing. Online is well implemented and exciting. Characters are so different from one another that there is a lot of space for you to expirement and develop your own unique style of playing. Seriously, I don't know how many ways to say "This game looks simple, but don't judge a game by it's jokeyness." Divekick is a silly, yet serious fighting game just as Borderlands is a serious, yet silly FPS/RPG. I'm not saying it's GOTY material, but I'm saying it is well worth the $10 price-tag. I'd recommend this to all fighting game fans, whether or not you're into 2D fighters. If I went back in time to fix mistakes from my past, I would make sure to buy Divekick again! It's really good, and very fun! Isn't that what gaming is all about?","August 23, 2013","true","5.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The characters are hilarious and each one is more ridiculous than the last. The entire game is a parody of every fighting game out there and it just works. Somehow a two button fighting game is amusing and takes control, strategy, and timing. However because the game only uses two buttons, controlling your specials gets very buggy and confusing and the gameplay itself gets rather repetitive. Though there is a large roster of characters with different specials and different storylines there just isn't much the developers can do to make the game any different between characters when they are limited to two buttons. Not to mention the very slow loading screen between very quick points. Overall the gameplay is fun and local play can get very intense and I visit this game again every so often but the lack of creativity and difference in gameplay makes me feel like it's all been done. 7.5/10","April 13, 2014","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it originally started as a parody of the modern fighting game, it has evolved into something greater than it's origins.\n\nWith only 2 buttons (Dive & Kick), the controls are surprisingly simple to appeal to everybody...  yet has some subtities that can appeal to the more hardcore player.  Battles are quick & are one-hit deals, so mastering the control & the reach of your character becomes critical for success.\n\nIf you're looking for fighting game that takes another path, you'll definitely want to give Divekick a try.","November 26, 2013","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Different characters will kick at different speed and angles. A power up meter is charged by kicking. Unleashing it (by pressing both buttons at once) will execute a character-specific special move. The simple-sounding system becomes very strategic as you try to anticipate and counter opponent's movements. The one-shot-kill nature of the combat adds unexpected levels of stress.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/244730/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","I have a bit of mixed feelings for Divekick. It's exactly what I predicted it would feel like gameplay-wise. Originally I bought this as a gift for a friend on the day it came out. I think the price was overkill. But it really depends on some factors:\n\n- You like parodies made on Mortal Kombat.\n\n- You're looking for comedy based on ethnocentrism or prejudice.\n\n- You're not looking for cool combos. Just K.O's.\n\nOverall I personally don't think the game is bad. Worth the daily deal of $2.50? Maybe. Depends on the factors I mentioned above. Otherwise you could do away without it.\n\nIn just under 1 hr you'll mostly see everything there is to know about this game. And from there on you can either keep playing it, or never play it again.\n\nOne thing I sometimes like to note about games is the credits. I counted about 50+ people that designed this game. This is too much for an Indie company imho. After all, the more complex Doom 3 was made by roughly the same amount of people before 2005. Divekick is the type of game that strikes me as a 5 man job. I'm fairly certain I've seen just as interesting web-based flash plugin fighter games.\n\nThe mechanics is sort of interesting. Each character seems to differ only by speed or boost to the dive (forwards/backwards) and the kick. I also feel that there is some weird collision system happening based on the dimensions of the characters. But overall it seems like you tend to get the most success of a K.O by allowing the enemy to attack first. There are special moves, however I ultimately still believe the many variations are caused by a change in speed.\n\nFor example, if you have a character that kicks at medium speed, you might notice that a character that drifts slowly may be more deadly as they tend to perform more of a flying kick rather than a divekick. But if you have a character that divekicks too fast, you may easily K.O someone that seems to be doing a slow-mo flying kick.\n\nAlthough the music is sort of transparent to me. It's reminiscent to I guess classic games like Double Dragon and Streets of Rage.\n\nAs a tiny quarrel: Initially I thought the main menu wasn't very intuitive. After a minute I get it. But it still feels bad navigating thereafter. I quote from Albert Einstein, "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler." That certainly applies to the main menu in terms of user-friendliness.\n\nIt seems to be that a large portion of this game has a lot to do with online multiplayer. So I can't really say I'm getting the full potential out of this game. I wouldn't mind giving the ranked matches a shot. But so far on my Steam friends list, only sauce seems to own this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/insert1coin/recommended/244730/","insert1coin","disposableLemon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/insert1coin/","973 products in account","DiveKick is a joke, a joke meant for a very niche set of gamers, a set i would consider myself a part of, the Fighting Game Community.\n\nUnfortunately its a joke that doesnt hold up, the premise is fantastic, remove the barrier for entry (complex button inputs and mechanic understanding) and make a fighting game entirely about the meta game, the understanding of your oponent, trying to predict their moves and then setting up traps for them to spring, this is encredibly satisfying or it would if about half the roster werent rather broken and somewhat unbalanced, there are certain match ups that are always going to benefit one character over the other, S=Kill (a parody of seth killian an ex capcom community manager) and the baz (a character joke from two best friends play i do believe) are really rather broken and somewhat overpowered\n\nDivekick is at its best when being played purely with the characters Dive and Kick, this games Ryu and Ken except these guys are west philadelphia born and raised. The story and characters are great if you get the jokes, but theyre just jokes that after theyre initial chuckle value dont hold up much, and characters like Mr. N and Jefailey are really niche paradies of major people involved within the FGC not every person interested in fighting games are gonna understand those jokes, i chuckled at jebaileys head growing bigger with each win but i had to google the backstory to Mr. N just so i wouldnt feel like i was missing the joke,\n\nnot all the joke characters are broken wolvereine and Dr Shoals are pretty awesome and the idea of stripping a fighting game down to its purest form is interesting but this just about misses the mark unfortunately.\n\nwhile i love that a game like this exists, the type of people who this game is really intended for probably already know enough about it to decide whether they intend to purchase it, and personally it isnt worth the full asking price, i got this on offer using money made from trading card sales but the idea of dropping cash on this, especially full price would have left me feeling very ripped off, the art work and animation quality are pretty poor as is the music, no great tunes here but obviously these arent as important as the gameplay, DiveKick is best played locally or with friends, who already play fighting games, and who stick to the unbroken characters, theres fun to be had here but theres a lot of problems too.\n\nIve had some collision detection issues with this, more than once ive sailed right through someone stomach and its not counted as a hit and looking online im not alone with this,\n\nif you are interested in this game, just be prepared for a lot of faults and kinda amateur ish quality, even then dont pay full price for this, to be honest its got Humble Bundle written all over it so just be patient and im sure itll turn up for a fair price at somepoint, a great idea that i can only recommend to very few people and for this reason it doesnt get my recommendation however i will say the GGPO net code is freaking superb no lag problems for me so far.\n\nall in all, buy with caution","November 27, 2013","false","1.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The actual mechanics make a lot of sense for the more basic characters, and the humor is a nice touch. Unfortunately, dealing with the interface that revolves around two buttons is a nightmare and is completely unintuitive. Couple that with multiplayer that is filled with people playing the same two cheap characters takes away from the core essence that the game seemed to originally strive for. Overall, if you don't mind dropping a few bucks for a couple laughs, go ahead.

The two button gameplay works well - it gives players only the bare minimum to move, attack, and defend, but that's all any player needs. As a result, the game gets to the meat of what fighting games are all about - reading your opponent and outplaying them. There's no elaborate combo system or pretzel motions to learn, so players can learn to play the game more quickly instead of just playing their character (though character matchups certainly have their importance). And because of the 1-hit KO system, anyone can be a threat - this isn't Marvel where a skilled player can steamroll a newbie with his eyes closed just because he knows touch of death combos by muscle memory. Every opponent demands caution and strategy, which keeps the game from getting dull (though it does get exhausting). The art is pretty bad, and the story mode isn't as ridiculous as it ought to be, but Divekick is about divekicking people in the face, and god damn does it succeed at doing that.\n\nAnd don't be that guy who thinks only Street Fighter clones are allowed into the hallowed halls of the Fighting Game Genre. That guy sucks at fighters. Play Divekick.","November 26, 2013","true","50.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are multiple characters which have varying abilities, strengths and weaknesses, as well as different game-modes for you to test and prove your prowess.\n\nI was never a "fighting game" kind of guy, a hell of a lot of Super Smash Brothers play, but not so much Mortal Kombat/Street Fighter, as is the style of this game, so I didn't feel driven to play more.\n\nHowever, if you're into fighting games, or if you have a few friends and fancy playing a fighting tournie one Friday night, this would be a great title to check out, really fun and original.\n\nNilesy","June 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nkdeffa/recommended/244730/","nkdeffa","DEFFA.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nkdeffa/","178 products in account","Divekick is the debut game of "Iron Galaxy Studios" published in 2013 and holds several awards. It is a simple 2 button 2D fighter offering multiplayer mode along with singleplayer. However, there were no players online when I attempted to test the multiplayer. You can play locally with a friend on a single PC as an option in versus mode as well. However you can't play against AI in versus mode as the only way to do it so is the Storyline mode. The game is filled with some iconic characters, each having his own storyline and several funny quotes. As good the voice over of quotes were I was really disappointed that storyline cinematics weren't voiced and the music was accompanied wasn't really fitting the episodes as well. Divekick has decent graphics but there's not much you can tweak around in settings. The only thing you can change is controls, but i don't really think you need anything more for a 2D game. The gameplay is as fun as 2 button fighter could be with power-ups and funny quotes each suiting the characters. It is really simple and there's no need for any tutorials. It's only about measuring the range between you and your opponent, either backing out or going in with two buttons.\n\nPROS:Gamepad support – (game supports both keyboard and gamepad)\n\nMultiplayer – (game supports multiplayer mode with ranking system,however there was no players so i couldn't test it out)\n\nFun/Enjoyable – (game has some iconic characters wich might seem familiar to you,game is really simple but it's filled with some funny quotes and tips which will make you at least smile, besides gameplay)\n\n2players 1pc – (you can play as two players from one pc in a versus mode)\n\nGraphics – (graphics are decent,nothing to brag about but nothing to be impressed of either)\n\nSimplicity – (game as basic and simple as it can be,it's only about measuring the range between you and your opponent,either backing out or going in with two buttons.\nCONS:AI –(you can't play agaisnt AI in versus mode,only way to do it so is the Storyline mode and i don't\nunderstand why)\n\nDead Multiplayer – (since game is couple of years old,there are no active players for multiplayer mode)\n\nMinor-Bugs – (in couple of matches there was red line appearing in the middle of a screen till the end of a round,nothing\ngame breaking but i thought it was worth to mentioning)\n\nCinematics – (cinematics are not voiced and it's accompanied with a terrible music which doesn't fit the episode at all)\n\nSoundtrack – (it might be about my personal taste but i don't think any of the tracks was matching the gameplay at all)\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews.

I hate fighting games as there's just too much to learn and there always seems to be someone who is unsurpassably better than me. Divekick does a pretty good job of eliminating that problem by having literally only two buttons: dive (jump) and kick. That's also the only way to move, so if you want to close the gap between you and your opponent, you will have to do several small divekicks and hope he doesn't do a big one right to your arrogant face, or a big one which is even easier to counter.\n\nEach match tends to be about 50% luck and 50% timing. But that's okay, because they're over in a flash and then it's on to the next! Which is good considering there's an achievement for 2000 Ranked Matches... achievement hunters be warned!","November 29, 2013","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Divekick is a fighter distilled to its essence. It's simple to learn, probably quite difficult to master (I have not mastered it)... and funny too. Even with just jumping (diving) and kicking, each character has a unique feel and angle of attack (plus a special move). If you're a fan of the genre, most characters are a parody of something else (mostly Marvel vs Capcom 3). See the wikipedia Divekick page for a better explanation.\n\nI'd like to see the game fleshed out a bit with a few more stages and options, but as-is, it's a bargain at a US$2.50 sale price.","December 2, 2013","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It had its hayday, and I've never cared much for the competitive level of it, which seems to be about all the legs it has left under it anymore. My enjoyment of it lies in the more accessible entries these days if I can glean any at all, and the failure to innovate on the genre as a whole has by and large left me moving on to other things.\n\nAlong came this odd duck though, Divekick. While it still falls to some of the same trappings of any other vs. fighter, the incredibly simple yet deceptively strategic gameplay breathes some much needed new life and individuality into this game.\n\nIt is truly that simplicity that makes this something more than just another vs. fighter. You have two buttons, one for "dive" which makes your character jump, and another for "kick" which makes them do their diving kick attack. If you use the kick button while not in the air, depending on the character, you may have another mobility option at your disposal, but it still only ever requires two buttons.\n\nThat's it. There are no d-pad/joystick movements. There are no strings of perfectly timed combos and reversals. There are no complex 360° movement requirements while in the air at the precise timing where your foot reaches your standing opponent's armpit. There is only dive, and kick. Sounds boring right? Surprisingly not!\n\nI found myself playing this more often than I expected to, given my apathy towards the genre in general, and the fact that it managed to keep me playing it beyond the first 10 minutes is testament enough. You see, as simple as this concept sounds, there really is a game to enjoy here. Each characters movesets vary slightly, and with every attack being a one hit-KO, it's all about the mental aspect, faking your opponents out, knowing your character's strong opponents and weak opponents, and really just some plain ol' good luck/timing.\n\nGive it a try, even if you don't usually like fighting games. You may not get all the genre in-jokes (I know I sure didn't) but I guarantee this is at least one fighting game that you won't have a frustrating time with the learning curve.","November 26, 2013","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although simple, it's very fun and still a fighting game at its core, but made more accessible. It's a game you can show to those who never even play video games and they'd be able to pick up and play.

And as much as Divekick hilariously parodies fighting games, it does more with its stripped-down mechanics than some full-fledged competitive fighters do with theirs. Divekick isn't the game to abandon the classics of the genre for; rather, its simplified mechanics remind us why we loved them, and how to continue to love them. We didn't start playing fighters for 500-hit 0-death air combos and irritating comeback mechanics. We came for decisive action, heated mindgames, and a healthy dose of hype.\n\nDivekick, along with the more traditional but equally solid Skullgirls, provides tight mechanics, clear design, and a unique and imaginative experience to be treasured by fighting game veterans and newcomers alike.","December 1, 2013","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The rounds are short enough to cycle losers out, and new challengers in, which keeps everyone involved in a two-player game pretty nicely.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are as simple as they can get: You dive (jump) and you kick. There are also two specials (One in the air, one on the ground) which can be activated by hitting both buttons at once. If you get hit, you lose. OHKO. But there is a surprising amount of depth to the play: One character teleports before every move, making him close to unreadable. Another one can go invisible, and a third can kick you through a tear in reality. And on top of this, every character has different jump heights, kick angles, and some can change these numbers in-game. It certainly helps to know your opponent, just as in any standard fighting game.\n\nBut again, this is definitely best if you have friends close by that you can play with: It shines in local multiplayer.","January 29, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Single player has a nonsensical story and rather easy opponents. Because the fighting system is so simple yet diverse enough to offer strategy, I would be willing to bet multiplayer would be a blast. However after sitting in a multplayer lobby for 40 minutes I found no one to fight. Just as I was about to give up, i saw 1 single person hosting a lobby of their own, i joined it... and waited another 20 minutes for the guy to notice my presence - I could hear him talking to someone presumably in another game from what I could gather and eventually he noticed. I had a mic but couldn't figure out how to make divekick recognize it. So we fight, and after I won the first 2 rounds he quit before the match ended which then caused divekick to crash.\n\nwith no multiplayer to speak of this game was just a waste of money and time for me.","January 27, 2015","false","0.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","5","12","3","0"

I can only assume this is some sort of joke and the positive reviewers are in on it.\n\nDivekick appears to be a big joke on the fighing game community... but unless you are super into tournament competetive play the jokes are completely not there and unfunny. Playing a round of Divekick is like walking into a room with a bunch of people laughing and just feeling confused because you dont know why, and noone tells you. Yes i like Figihing games. Yes my friends like fighting games, some even competing in tourneys. no the general public doesnt give a rip thats its "funny" that you name a character whose head literally inflates after each victory after a guy who arranges tourneys and then plays in the same ones he hosts. Yes, in "Divekick" that is a thing.\n\nHow does the game play? like 5th grade geometry. Every charachters movest can be broken down into triangles, or trapezoids. Ive won most of the online games i have played by just sitting there and doing one move at the right time while the other player jumps around like an idiot. Angle x intersects angle y at point z. Does that mean i have "skiilz"? This game is a joke, both literally and figuratively, it plays like a bad flash game and has all the humor of a small community in-joke. A good game COULD be made with a 2 button control scheme im sure, but "Divekick" aint it. Save your money and nab "skullgirls" instead.

It's like it is trying to make the point that it's not about button mashing or picking the "strongest" character. Well...congratulations, dive kick: you proved it. But did it really take an entire GAME for it? :-\\nIt's probably pretty fun in a local multiplayer (which I haven't tried), but let's be honest: nearly all games are. And this game looks only slightly more complex than a rock-paper-scissors game. Yes, I'm sure it has plenty of depth if you take timing, reflexes, tactical movement and such into account...but everything being so bareboned means that there's little incentive to explore. I mean...I finished the campaign in less than half an hour.\nThe voices are sort of funny, but it gets old. Visuals are...I'd say "okay", but I've gotta say that even by Indy standards, I've seen plenty better. Characters are dull and uninteresting as well, but with just two buttons you can't really argue on that.\n\nAll in all...meh.

Even my grandmother knows what Divekick is, and if you're reading this, you've already seen a couple screens of it and probably skimmed a couple other reviews.\n\nI organize my steam library by genre, and when I went to sort this one, it gave me pause. Sure, it's kind of a fighting game, but it's also a bit of a strategy. Mostly, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nThe worlds first two-button fighter (and it means that literally. No analog stick movement at all. Dive. Kick.) comes to us from Iron Galaxy games, and maybe it should have stayed there. Previously a developer for Dungeons and Dragons digital titles, they moved to a heavily meme-inflated "fighting" game where you first dive (or 'jump', but whatever) by pressing one button, and then, while in the air, kick using the other. That's it. There's a cast of characters to choose from, most of them harkening back to inside jokes.\n\nIt's moderately funny, I guess, but that's hardly a reason to spend 10 bucks. Basically if you have Divekick, it's because you got hyped on it (or in my case, someone gifted it) and spent maybe as long as I have playing it. Poor replay value outside of sheer novelty, poor gameplay attibuting victories to luck rather than any variant of skill, and after the third or fourth time he holds up the, "I don't hug white girls." sign, the joke loses its luster, and I quit out to go play a fighting game with more than two buttons.\n\nShould you get it? Do you make enough money to literally waste ten dollars? Sure, but if you're even a tiny bit iffy about it, wait until the next time it's 90% off. In the meantime, there are better ten dollar games.\n\nHell, there are better FIVE dollar games.

It's tough to even understand sometimes how such a thing even happens with someone who tries to keep a relatively open mind.\n\nSomething about Divekick rubbed me the wrong way from the outset. It was a silly little thing then, based on a (not at all funny) joke. But it was still that; just a joke. I didn't care for it at all, but I also didn't have to pay attention to it. A story here and there cropped up from time to time, but I could easily scroll past it.\n\nBut then, something happened. The guy behind it, Adam "Keits" Heart, decided to make a Kickstarter to make it a real thing. Now I'd been following Keits' writings for a while, and I respect the man, I really do. But I didn't have any interest in his project at all. However, the more I tried to avoid it, the more it was being thrown in my face. It plastered front page several times a week on every video game site I'd visited for months, every one of my fighting game fan friends kept asking me about it over and over (somehow, they all have less memory retention than I do), and every time the game was even mentioned online, in came hundred-page comments about how "gdlk" it was. It was like one giant hive-mind circle-jerk joke that would not leave me alone. Even once it released, the joke spilled over into reviews on every reputable site (and some that weren't) known to man, with short reviews about how perfect the game is, whilst using only fighting game memes and lingo in ways that didn't actually tell you why it was supposed to be so good.\n\nA couple of months had passed, and the fervor died down, except for certain websites. I saw it on Steam sale for less than $3, and I figured "What the hell, the best I could do is give it a fair shot."\n\nWorst two-something I've ever spent.\n\nTo be fair, it does have much more depth than I had anticipated. In every other regard, however, it falls short of even my already ground level expectations, and even the depth feels wrong.\n\nRight from the get-go, you're visually assaulted by the graphical quality. The character and background drawings are decent enough, but they're godawful as sprites and have some utterly horrendous animation. It takes a lot of work to screw up animation for a game where 90% of the actions are rising into the air and dropping back down, but dammit, they managed.\n\nThe characters are mostly appalling, with half of the cast being parodies of real Fighting Game Community "personalities". It's this half of the roster that I absolutely loathe, with the remaining half being a mix of somewhat tolerable and "pretty okay." Look, video game memes can be hit or miss, but most of them are amusing for a while. Who didn't slip "All your base are belong to us" or "The cake is a lie" into conversation from time to time at some point? But video game community jokes and memes are pretty much never entertaining, between the tournaments and the talking heads and the bulldung Youtube Let's Players. Look, I GET the references, they are just stupid. There's literally only one character in the game that I genuinely like, and that's Stream.\n\nSo okay, the game could look like horse manure and still be great, and the characters are mostly a superficial thing anyway, so when it boils down to it, what is it that matters most? Gameplay. Strike three, Divekick. The game, as it is so often boasted, consists of literally just two buttons to control: Dive, and Kick - one to jump into the air, the other to come back down and attempt to plant down in the opponent's face. Simple enough, and just the fact that there is no way to maneuver your character outside of these acts does require a bit of strategical thinking. And then there's the gem system, which does about as much as it did in Street Fighter X Tekken (i.e. their effects are mostly barely noticeable), and that's how it all started. But then they started cramming in all the different other things - the air and ground specials, the character-specific eccentrics, and so on. It took what could have been a simple, quick one-on-one game, and made it into something much more complicated. It seems to detract from the game's original intended spirit, such as it was.\n\nCompounding all of these annoyances, is the fact that despite the game being developed by the sort of guys that would masturbate over tier lists, it's got absolute ♥♥♥♥ for balance. There are a select few characters that head and shoulders above the rest, and a few that are absolute flounders, and the rest are stuck somewhere in the middle, grasping for a chance to rise or fall to either of the other sides. The CPU makes good use of this fact; the characters that are absolute trash in the hands of a player, also are the easiest to beat. The tougher characters, however, dominate nearly every time. The Baz in particular was the biggest source of frustration, even more so than the boss, because when the computer plays him, every single round has him firing himself in the direction your character is, faster than possible to react 90% of the time.\n\nI guess probably the best part is that online is mostly functional, such as it is, or at least it was during the brief time that I monkeyed with it. They definitely have made sure they weren't one of those companies that believes that automatically slapping GGPO onto a game without customizing it to fit the game makes online "good", but then again there is a lot less to worry about in something that doesn't have command moves, 360s, proper combos, and the like.\n\nI've been one of the biggest advocates for change, or at least trying something new, in fighting games, for the better part of the decade. As much as I love the genre, every game pretty much hits the same set of checkboxes and plays it safe, and that's what causes things to grow stale. However, I do not feel that Divekick is anywhere close to what is needed for a competently put-together fighting game that shuns the norm - it's all at once too much, and not enough. In fact, to be perfectly honest, despite its roots, I hesitate to consider it a fighting game at all. It's really more of a... PVP falling simulator.","August 21, 2014","false","2.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

And half the price to boot!\n\nYes, OFDP is only a stylized stick figure.  Here, we have "real" persons... who never become fleshed out.

Though it may seem simple (hit first, don't get hit, jump, kick), it's a bit more complex than that. Each character has their own kick type move, and special moves that can quickly defeat your enemy. Also gems help fix in what your character may lack in such as better kicks or jumps, or gaining more meter. Although I think $10 might be a bit too much. If you have a coupon for the game, or it's on sale, I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a good competitive game and a good laugh.","September 20, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Designed with the intention of making fighting game less completed.Divekick introduces us to a two button scheme. One must simply jump and dive to knock out the opposing player this often leads to players diving back and forth with tension skyrocketing as they wonder who will be hit first. in addition the games divekicks each character has a air and ground ability which can change the tide of many a battle allowing new trickery and backstabbing. With a wide host of characters each with their own campagn. One can easily find hours of enjoyment out of mastering each one before inviting friends to crush or before trying out the ranked online. However divekick still has its flaws there is no way to back out of character select screens at all unless you join a game. Another error is two people may divekick each at the same time and be hit with a double ko or only one will be. This happens whenever it feels like and often make it confusing to guess one someone is going to be ko. all in all Divekick is a good game with flaws but nothing gamebreaking or unplayable.

Just two buttons. No joystick, no d-pad, no other buttons, just two. One for jump and one for kick. Each hit in Divekick is a one-hit-Knockout, so games go pretty quick. The game has a roster of 13 characters which all play surprisingly differently. At least I was surprised how much character variety can be had with a two button game.\n\nBecause there’s only two buttons, Divekick is also very accessible; there’s no memorizing combos or movesets, so anyone can jump right in and start playing. The game also has a very ridiculous sense of humor. There’s lots of poking fun at other fighting games, pop-culture references and internet humor references. There’s a character in the game who just quotes Will Smith lines from all of his movies. It’s quite silly.\n\nOverall though, I’d say there’s probably not a whole lot of depth or replayability with Divekick. It’s a fun novelty to have in your game collection, but it’s probably not going to hold anyone’s attention for very long.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","January 24, 2014","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite the game's lack of input options (seeing as there are only two buttons) it is more than just dive and kick, rinse and repeat. If you want to come out on top, you will have to out-smart your opponent while avoiding falling pray to their own mind games. Seeing as the first one to get hit loses, one mistaken can lose you a round and repeated mistakes will surely end in defeat.\nBeing the parody fighting game that Divekick is, the game comes with many references and jokes originating from the fighting game community that appear all over the game. As someone who has never played many fighting games, I didn't get most of the references, but a little research  or a friend versed in said community can help to clear a few things up.\nUltimately, Divekick is a funny, enjoyable and straightforward game that catters to all gamers of all skill levels. The biggest complaint about the game is that it can feel a little short lived, especially since the community has begun to dwindle and the story mode will only last you so long. This can be a problem for those with hurting wallets looking for the most bag for your buck, but playing with friends is always a blast. $10 might seem a little steep for some, but it's definetly worth getting on sale if you've had any interst in the game.","December 16, 2013","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Throw that nonsense out the window because they have nothing on this. This game takes character influences from everywhere, and the things they say are HILARIOUS. Even the loading screen "hints" are so meta you won't believe your mind. There are 2 buttons, "Dive" and "Kick". Simple. Kicking while diving sends your character forward while kicking on the ground usually sends them backward, removing the need for more buttons. You can also use "specials" by hitting both buttons, but you honestly don't even need that. There are also "gems" to upgrade your character's stats to try and gain an advantage over your opponent. Oh, also, it is 1-hit kills. So it is all about timing and mindgames.\n\nStory: 7/10\nSo it is a fighting game, so naturally it isn't about the story, although from what I have played so far, everyone has a backstory and it is ABSOLUTELY silly and amazing.\n\nAudio: 10/10\nThe announcer, honestly the best part of the game. Every time I see someone who I enjoy playing this game with, we yell out DIVEKICK to each other trying to sound like the announcer. The music is decent, but you aren't really paying attention to it because the announcer is #1. Also, when you lose, your character usually says something hilarious like "Ganked!" or "No MIA calls!" (from games like League of Legends where those are apart of the meta.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nFor what the game is, the graphics are simplistic but quite detailed. It gives everything you need to be aesthetically pleasing and hilarious, but at the same time simple enough so that there is no input lag, which is a MAJOR importance in every game.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nHonestly, Dive and Kick. What more do you need, 'nuff said. Headshots stun your opponent for 5 seconds in the next round, and chain headshots give Double Kill and Rampage for the additional sillies.\n\nOverall: 10/10\nThis game is beautiful. Hilarious. Magnificent. Find some friends, set up a tournament, and kick some dive. I personally HATE fighting games, they aren't very fun to me. The only "fighting" game I have ever liked is Super Smash Bros and that doesn't even count as a traditional fighting game because of how unbalanced it is. That being said, this, DIVEKICK, truly the best fighting game out there. I recommend getting it when it is on sale, and grabbing some friends and screwing around with it.","December 17, 2013","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people play one and dedicate hours into learning movesets, combos, counters, specials; all kinds of complex, frustrating game mechanics. Others just pick a fighter and find a move that they can beat others with reliably. Still others try one and never play again, put down by the large list of things to learn in order to play.\n\nWith Divekick, all that complex crap is thrown out the window into moving traffic at rush hour. Divekick reduces the core of the fighting genre down to two measly buttons. I don't mean two attack buttons and a d-pad, I mean nothing but two buttons for EVERYTHING: menus, attacking, movement, everything (except pause, but that's besides the point).\n\n'You must be joking, ' I hear you thinking, 'that sounds like a crappy mobile game, not a hardcore fighter!' Well, technically, it IS a joke, more of a parody really. Divekick is a jab at the fighting game genre, it's filled with in-jokes and references to prominent characters and people that mostly only hardcore fighter enthusiasts would understand. But even at it's core, it stays very true to it's roots.\n\nThe gameplay boils down to two actions: Dive, which acts as a jump ("Dive" into the air) and Kick, which launches your character at a downward angle to strike your opponent. Kick when performed on the ground causes your character to leap backwards, put these together and you have the basics of movement and attack. One hit causes a KO and the first to 5 wins is the victor of the match. Attacks that connect the head cause  the recipient to be dazed during the first few seconds of the next fight and each attack fills a special meter, which when both buttons are pressed, performs one of two special attacks depending on if you are grounded or in the air.\n\nThis all sounds very, very simple. Well, yeah, that's the point. While all of the 13 characters may seem similar, each has a different Dive and Kick motion which affects how you play them. Dive, one of the main characters, kicks down at a 45 degree angle, while Kung Pao  has a slower, more lateral kick that reaches further, but opens her up more to an attack. The Baz has a kick that spreads lightning behind him, which is what actually connects, not his foot. Furthermore, every character's specials are unique and provide either escape or approach and attack moves, even status effects in some cases.\n\nThe simplified controls therefore mask a very complex game that embodies the heart of fighting games, timing, quick reflexes, baiting and mind games, outthinking your opponent. This is magnified by the fact that many of the developers are avid fighter fans, who have spent a long time balancing and perfecting  the mechanics to create a game that's no less complex at it's core than say, Guilty Gear or Marvel vs Capcom. This is also shown by the many references to the competitive fighting game community that exist in the characters and one-liners.\n\nDivekick also supports local and online multiplayer, with a ranking board. At the time of writing, I've found it hard to find other people to play with online, but I have found a few matches (haven't tried much yet).\n\nAt the end, this is a deceptively complex and refined fighter that attempts to remove all the endless movelists and combo strings that keep many gamers away from fighting games. In this gamer's opinion, it does it's job well. I highly suggest trying it out, especially if you like fighting games. Cheap too :D","December 29, 2013","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recommend it to both fighting game fans and those who may not be good at fighters. Divekick reduces the fighting to two simple buttons: Dive and Kick. You can only move forward or back using the two button setup. It sounds overly simplistic, but you will find a whole heap of strategy once you start playing.\n\nEvery hit is an instant kill so this game can get frantic. The later levels are very challenging, but I imagine this game is a blast online or with friends. It also has no problems poking fun at itself and the fighting game genre as a whole. For it's sarcasm, easy-as-you-want-it-to-be nature, and refreshing fighting mechanics, I highly recommend this game!","January 1, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Divekick is a 2D fighting game, but has a weird twist. There are only two buttons for Divekick one button being dive and the other being kick. If you get hit once, you lose. At first I thought the game was a stupid idea, and a stupid purchase, but the more you play it the more the game drags you in wanting you to play more. However this game is not for everyone, after a while the AI becomes difficult and cheap, and the game can get kind of boring if you don't have any friends to play it with. If you're not a serious fan of fighting games, I don't know how this game could sit with you. But for me this game is a new feel on a common theme in games, and brings a new twist wanting you to play more.

The biggest problem with fighting games tends to be the time investment it takes to learn a character, from their moveset to their matchups to actial execution of combos. Divekick removes most of that, mapping everything to two buttons. This moves most of the focus to the mindgame portion of fighting games, which is really what makes them interesting. My biggest problem with Divekick is that the characters are just varied enough that it serves to undermine the premise. You could stick with playing Dive or Kick, who are pretty simple, but what if you didn't know that Jefailey charges his dropkick? This makes the investment needed to truly enjoy this game clash a bit with the underlying simplicity. All in all, Divekick still executes really well what it set out to do, with some minor issues.","June 26, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure I really liked stuff like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and the like... But Divekick is the first time I ever felt like I could compete legitimately.\n\nThe Lang Zone is in full effect here with a brilliantly minimalist design. All characters have a million health and every attack does four million damage. There are two buttons. You jump, and then you kick. The brilliance of this design is that it is so simple yet there is depth in the way each character jumps, how each one kicks, and how their supers behave. Even the super moves are brilliantly simple, being activated simply by hitting both buttons at once and changing depending on whether you are on the ground or in the air.\n\nI watched this game developed from the ground up thanks to the beautiful romance between Dave Lang and the GB crew and I'm so happy I saw it all the way through.

Designed with the intention of making fighting game less completed.Divekick introduces us to a two button scheme. One must simply jump and dive to knock out the opposing player this often leads to players diving back and forth with tension skyrocketing as they wonder who will be hit first. in addition the games divekicks each character has a air and ground ability which can change the tide of many a battle allowing new trickery and backstabbing. With a wide host of characters each with their own campagn. One can easily find hours of enjoyment out of mastering each one before inviting friends to crush or before trying out the ranked online. However divekick still has its flaws there is no way to back out of character select screens at all unless you join a game. Another error is two people may divekick each at the same time and be hit with a double ko or only one will be. This happens whenever it feels like and often make it confusing to guess one someone is going to be ko. all in all Divekick is a good game with flaws but nothing gamebreaking or unplayable. Grab your friends and find out who is a fraud or be choked out.","January 12, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However you can't do much with 2 buttons, and fights are mostly about timing and learning all the animations by heart. This can get old, as learning the animations means you hit a gameplay ceiling, and the only thing left will be how quickly in microseconds you can click a button compared to your adversary.\n\nWorth purchasing and playing, especially if you see it on sale, but don't expect to get a lot of mileage out of this title.","March 3, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Throw that nonsense out the window because they have nothing on this. This game takes character influences from everywhere, and the things they say are HILARIOUS. Even the loading screen "hints" are so meta you won't believe your mind. There are 2 buttons, "Dive" and "Kick". Simple. Kicking while diving sends your character forward while kicking on the ground usually sends them backward, removing the need for more buttons. You can also use "specials" by hitting both buttons, but you honestly don't even need that. There are also "gems" to upgrade your character's stats to try and gain an advantage over your opponent. Oh, also, it is 1-hit kills. So it is all about timing and mindgames.\n\nStory: 7/10\nSo it is a fighting game, so naturally it isn't about the story, although from what I have played so far, everyone has a backstory and it is ABSOLUTELY silly and amazing.\n\nAudio: 10/10\nThe announcer, honestly the best part of the game. Every time I see someone who I enjoy playing this game with, we yell out DIVEKICK to each other trying to sound like the announcer. The music is decent, but you aren't really paying attention to it because the announcer is #1. Also, when you lose, your character usually says something hilarious like "Ganked!" or "No MIA calls!" (from games like League of Legends where those are apart of the meta.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nFor what the game is, the graphics are simplistic but quite detailed. It gives everything you need to be aesthetically pleasing and hilarious, but at the same time simple enough so that there is no input lag, which is a MAJOR importance in every game.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nHonestly, Dive and Kick. What more do you need, 'nuff said. Headshots stun your opponent for 5 seconds in the next round, and chain headshots give Double Kill and Rampage for the additional sillies.\n\nOverall: 10/10\nThis game is beautiful. Hilarious. Magnificent. Find some friends, set up a tournament, and kick some dive. I personally HATE fighting games, they aren't very fun to me. The only "fighting" game I have ever liked is Super Smash Bros and that doesn't even count as a traditional fighting game because of how unbalanced it is. That being said, this, DIVEKICK, truly the best fighting game out there. I recommend getting it when it is on sale, and grabbing some friends and screwing around with it.","December 17, 2013","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want something fiercely competitive but approachable, get this. Also, if you don't like 2D fighting games, and you're not sure why, this might help. Control, priority, spacing and footsies are all represented in some way in this game, and if you're a button masher at heart, this game can actually help you out of your awful habits.\nThe number of fighting game community injokes and silliness is a bit bewildering for those outside of the community, however.

Designed with the intention of making fighting game less completed.Divekick introduces us to a two button scheme. One must simply jump and dive to knock out the opposing player this often leads to players diving back and forth with tension skyrocketing as they wonder who will be hit first. in addition the games divekicks each character has a air and ground ability which can change the tide of many a battle allowing new trickery and backstabbing. With a wide host of characters each with their own campagn. One can easily find hours of enjoyment out of mastering each one before inviting friends to crush or before trying out the ranked online. However divekick still has its flaws there is no way to back out of character select screens at all unless you join a game. Another error is two people may divekick each at the same time and be hit with a double ko or only one will be. This happens whenever it feels like and often make it confusing to guess one someone is going to be ko. all in all Divekick is a good game with flaws but nothing gamebreaking or unplayable. Grab your friends and find out who is a fraud or be choked out.","January 12, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Divekick is a 2D fighting game, but has a weird twist. There are only two buttons for Divekick one button being dive and the other being kick. If you get hit once, you lose. At first I thought the game was a stupid idea, and a stupid purchase, but the more you play it the more the game drags you in wanting you to play more. However this game is not for everyone, after a while the AI becomes difficult and cheap, and the game can get kind of boring if you don't have any friends to play it with. If you're not a serious fan of fighting games, I don't know how this game could sit with you. But for me this game is a new feel on a common theme in games, and brings a new twist wanting you to play more.

I recommend it to both fighting game fans and those who may not be good at fighters. Divekick reduces the fighting to two simple buttons: Dive and Kick. You can only move forward or back using the two button setup. It sounds overly simplistic, but you will find a whole heap of strategy once you start playing.\n\nEvery hit is an instant kill so this game can get frantic. The later levels are very challenging, but I imagine this game is a blast online or with friends. It also has no problems poking fun at itself and the fighting game genre as a whole.
