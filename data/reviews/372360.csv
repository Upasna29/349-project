As of now the port is an amateur mess and is a confirmed inferior PS3 port.\nCons:\n-Doesn't launch properly. Solutions: Go to the root folder of the game and "Run the executable as Administrator" (or go to properties, compatibility and check "Run this program as administrator"\nGo to the root folder of the game and open CustomConfig.conf with a text editor (Notepad).  Set FullScreen to 0 and save.\nEnable compatibility mode (try Windows XP SP3)\nDisable antivirus software\nDisable overclocking / overlay software such as MSI Afterburner and Riva Tuner\nInstall Visual C++ Redistributables that are located in _CommonRedist\vcredist\2010 (go to the root folder of the game)\nIf for some reason you don't have a C:\ drive then you can change the drive letter of an existing partition or simply use an external drive (advanced users only)(patched)-Internal resolution locked at 720p. You can choose any resolution you want, but the game will stay the same. Likely has FXAA (see screenshot) and forced VSync.\n-Framerate locked to 30fps. No framerate options whatsoever.\n-Absolutely no (functioning) graphical options. At all.\n-Grammatical errors in main menu and poor localizations / translations.(patched)\n-Publisher themselves are aware of some issues such as saving delay on Windows 7 and have done nothing to fix it before launching the game.(patched)\n-Some users experience delays/crashes when accessing, confirming options or certain random points/events of the game.\n-Alt-tabbing works, but it takes time before you can restore the window.\n-Language setting isn't saved after a restart.\n-For some users the game is running at 40 fps, which makes the game run faster.\n-The game might have a 3rd party anti-tamper such as Denuvo, VMProtect and needs Adminstrator rights to write temp files in root of C: drive.(partially patched) Completely unnecessary, wasn't present in Zestiria.\n-Some report input lag (weaker systems?)\n\nPros.\n-Recognizes a Xinput gamepad and shows correct button icons.\n-Keyboard controls are rebindable.\n-There's an option to select Japanese audio.\n-Supports windowed mode.\n-No reports of gamebreaking bugs.\n-Satisfactory performance.\n\nCustomize (Options) screen:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614039806\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614039833\nIn-game sample running at "1440p" (is actually upscaled 720p):\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614039784\n\nWrite in the comments other things/solutions you notice. Help some other people out!\n\nThe game might be great, but the condition of this port is appalling. Also note that there are people that have no technical issues with this game whatsoever.

If you haven't played it yet either as a fan of the series or as someone interested in getting into the series, there is no other game I would recommend over Symphonia as a starting point.  It's not the best in the series but it's still one of the most solid entries and should be experienced if only because this game is ultimately what popularized the series in the west.\n\nHowever...\n\nBamco continues to not care enough about their consumers to put any kind of effort into making a proper PC port.  Lacking features that should be standard this day and age appropriate with the times for 2016 PC gaming.  Several errors that cause the game to not even run at all on some systems.  Not even indie developers tend to ♥♥♥♥ up like this.  What's so mysterious about this completely poor showing is that it's hard to say they're just pushing out a quick and dirty port and having the name alone carry them to profits when it takes the fans literal MINUTES to fix a lot of the problems.  Surely it's not an issue of allocating their resources at Bamco.\n\nNo, instead we have framerate limiters and upscaled 720p alongside 'anti-piracy' measures that prevent the fans from removing some of these issues for a game that can still be pirated AND emulated better years ago in its GC incarnation.  It's not a matter of them being lazy and doing what should be an extremely simple task to bring their game to a modern PC audience, they are ACTIVELY NEUTERING THEIR GAME instead for who the ♥♥♥♥ knows why.  They don't have to 'fix' the game so much as they have to just remove restrictions that they themselves put in place.  Try figuring that ♥♥♥♥ out.\n\nDon't give them your money.  These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are literally toying with you to see what they can get away with and still get your money for.  Pirate the GC version because it'll perform a lot better.  If we continue to support amateur hour work like this, we are going to continue to get amateur hour work like this.  The only language big businesses know is the one your wallet speaks.

It returned _once_ about 4 hours into a binge, but has otherwise not been an issue. It looks like they're fixing issues but if I were considering to buy this product, I'd wait until they produced a few more updates before actually purchasing this port. It seems the bad press is forcing Namco to act. This is sad, since Zestiria's port was actually pretty good. A little rushed and buggy, but not in any way that disrupted gameplay.\n\nTales of Symphonia itself is a classic Tales game from 2003, and it's the first ever 3D Tales game. This port is a more or less the remastered PS3 version ported to PC.\n\nLike all Tales games, it uses the Linear Motion Battle System where you move your character in real time across a 2D line on a 3D battlefield -- between yourself and whatever enemy is selected. It plays much like a fighting game or a brawler in that you make real time attacks, perform combos, and need to defend or evade like you would in a brawler. Of course like an RPG, you have 3 other AI controlled party members and you can order them occasionally, but usually they'll just do their own thing. This game's unique gimmicks are Unison Attacks and Overlimits, the former being a bonus attack similar to QTE's and the latter just seems to happen randomly. Unfortunately those Unison Attacks use a PS3 controller interface and I can never seem to get all four to execute.\n\nIt's pretty awkward compared to current Tales games...the most notable aspect is this game came out before free roam existed, but while jumping was still an option. So you can't run around to flank enemies, but there are aerial abilities you can perform to achieve the same effect. Having played Phantasia before any others in the series, it wasn't too difficult to pick up on. It's still the awesome battle system that got me hooked on the series.\n\nI had issue with the controls...it might be my 360 controller, but navigating the map was a pain since it uses push sensitivity for walk/run and I'd often find myself walking. It's probably since I'm a PCphile that I settled on using keyboard controls. The default controls are for people whose arms are 3 inches apart, but after switching to WASD + numpad I found gameplay to be pretty enjoyable.\n\nI'm not going to comment on the story until I get further through. 8 hours is too few to judge...but so far it's a mix of a pretty lighthearted party in a pretty bleak world.\n\nGraphics are...720p. They're a notable improvement over the Gamecube graphics but still seem a generation behind for the most part. Also they're quite blurry, being locked at 720 arbitrarily. Bit of a weak point for the game.\n\nThe soundtrack is the kind you'd actually make the effort to purchase separately. Not only do I prefer melodic over ambient, I love Motoi Sakuraba's style.\n\nAnyway, I plan on changing my thumbs down into a thumbs up, but not until this port is fixed.\nTHERE WAS NO EXCUSE.","February 3","false","58.2"," 144 of 189 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","144","189","8","3"

Internal resolution is locked to 720p so even if you set the resolution higher everything just becomes blurry and jaggy. Issues mentioned can be fixed using mods which greatly enhances the textures, thumbs up to the modder and thumbs down to Bandai Namco.\n\nYou've had months since the launch of Tales of Zestiria to work on porting this game, you've had ample time to test if things were in place before launch, a preload was done. Yet when the game launched it came with 30s wait time when trying to go into the customize menu and saving, long start up time, locked internal resolution, 10-20s of waiting time alt tabbing back in, empty text boxes in other languages, Italian and Spanish menus switched around.\n\nOne more thing not so much a bug but a poor choice, invasive DRM that causes anti viruses to go off.\n\nHow did you launch a game that has a price tag attached with all those bugs? Someone along the chain has the wrong idea, if you want to bring your popular series to new audiences then you're going to want to do some self reflection and take a look at how other companies are bringing their ports to PC.\n\nThose of you on the fence, i recommend you holding back for now until Bandai Namco at least fixes up the issues themselves.

That is considering that it ran at a consistent 60FPS on the Gamecube over a decade ago.\n-Being upscaled, everything is variable levels of blurry. The cutscenes look like someone smeared vaseline all over the screen. Also, the character models are higher fidelity than environments, so they look entirely out of place in the environments.\n-The animations of characters (including just running around on the overworld) feel weirdly twitchy and unresponsive. I wonder if it has to do with the framerate.\n-As usual fare from this company, you have unnecessarily invasive and intrusive DRM. Guys, do you want people to buy your product or to nick it? This isn't helping and it only encourages the latter, as people don't want to pay for a bad experience if they can have a far better one for free. I thought we learned this lesson from this music industry and all the idiotic tat that Ubisoft was doing?\n-The game also seems to be oddly unstable. I've had CTDs when launching the game, I've had CTDs when trying to toggle things in the Options menu, I've even had a CTD when I simply left Lloyd standing idle.\n-Alt+Tabbing locks the game for some 30+ seconds.\n-No mouse support anywhere. Did you forget that you were porting this to PC?\n-I know this might sound petty, but... Why are there only six save slots? I haven't had my Gamecube in years, but I'm pretty sure even the GC version wasn't that limited.\n\nAt this point, I'm going to wait a bit and see what patches the developer will release and, if they are inadequate, I will refund the game.

I feel like Bandai got lazy with this port unlike ToZ which was perfect pre and post mod patch for the 30-60FPS.\n\nNow the game runs fine at 30FPS. So whats the problem with this game?\nThere is a lot of typos and bad Grammar being found around the game. You can find one at the Option menu and find the Battle Control spelled as Battle Contorol? Deeper in the game there will be Dialog that doesn't seem to make sense.\nAnother big problem is those using Windows 7. If you are a windows 7 user, you will encounter numerous bugs, crashes, lag and client glitches. There are some fixed being discuss at the Community Forums but it seems a mod or official patch is needed to fix this said problems.\nThose using Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 will still find around just minor problems but will work fine.\nResolution.....Bad Idea to lock it at 720p Bandai. No matter what resolution you pick, it will be locked at 720p which will cause major problem playing the game. Camera will be so problematic when checking around the world map and in battle as you can't really see the area very well. It also feels stretched that you will find stuttering and possible blacklines.\nAlso beware as Bandai added a DRM called VMProtect. They are screwing people especially those with SSD so beware. Its very harmful and will damage you harddrive.\n\nNow if you want the original OP from the GC and Ps2, a friend of mine has created it for everyone to enjoy. It replaces the Ps3 OP.\nMOD: Replace the 2013 Japanese songs with Original Jap GC and PS2 songs.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614146924","February 2","false","7.8"," 88 of 124 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","88","124","5","21"

I honestly hope whoever handled this port, and I mean this in the nicest way possible, finds something else they are good at, because this is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age, and it gives the game a reputation it doesn't deserve, and it's incredibly unfortunate for a game that I absolutely adore.","February 7","false","3.1"," 51 of 67 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","51","67","2","2"

I played the Gamecube version multiple times; it was an solid game that mixed up the staleness of the JRPG genre with some interesting mechanics. I would strongly recommend the game to anyone looking for some classics because, despite its worn visuals and flawed (PAINFULLY flawed, at times) voice-acting -- it's a powerful experience.\n\nBut I will not recommend this port. This is NOT a good port.\n\nStarting up this decade-old relic of a game, one must avoid clicking away from the first (1st) window to pop up because doing so runs the risk of causing the entire game to crash. It does NOT like being tabbed out of. One would, however, be forgiven during this initial period for thinking that the game has completely crashed, because the load-up at times can take at least half a minute before you even get to the first Bandai-Namco splash. When you DO get to the main menu, be advised: attempting to enter the "Customize" menu at the start menu (as well as from within a loaded game) causes the game to lock up for as much as 10 seconds at a time before bringing up the proper menu. The same is true of either saving or loading as well. And I cannot for the life of me understand the nonsensical decision to shove what few graphics options they allow at the very bottom of the options menu; your choices are limited to FULLSCREEN OR WINDOWED, although to their credit they do at LEAST give you the choice of resolution, even if that alone is a little out-of-place.\n\nIf you attempt to bring up the Steam overlay, however, the game will crash.\n\nAnd speaking of the "Customize" menu... there is STILL no way to turn down the volume on the ear-bleeding "blip" that plays whenever you're moving from option-to-option.\n\nOnce you start a new playthrough the game runs fine overall. It's definitely got nothing on the disaster that was the Arkham Knight port in that regard -- at least it runs when you're playing. But during my playtime I DID experience one or two points where the framerate randomly began to stutter. I am not entirely certain of what was causing it, nor if it was even going to be a recurring thing.\n\nI'm gonna stress to you right now: my problems are NOT from bad hardware. I can run the current experimental build of Star Citizen at high settings with this rig. Heck -- any machine with a card as recent as the GTX 600 series will likely have no problem running this game -- or shouldn't, anyway. My problems are caused by bad, bad, bad bad BAD optimization.\n\nWhat's more... they advertise this as being based off the PS3 version of the game, but I'm left questioning that. I cannot confirm the veracity of this, but a friend of mine is insistent from the look of what he saw of my playing this earlier that it is, in fact, based off the Japan-only Playstation 2 port of the original Gamecube version. I cannot stress enough how dubious this claim is, but I'm willing to believe him based on how poorly this version handles.\n\nIf anything good came of my purchase here, it was the urge to pull my Gamecube version down from the shelf. What a joke.","February 1","false","7.8"," 76 of 110 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","76","110","5","0"

I bought it back when it was new on GameCube and loved the blend of smooth action combat, surprisingly detailed environment, engaging and sometime dark storyline, and that wonderful soundtrack. It's showing its age, but it's still very playable and a lot more approachable than Tales of Zestiria.\n\nBAMCO had the opportunity here to release the definitive version of this game for GameCube and PS3 players alike. Instead we have this absolutely shocking port. Visual polish present in the GCN version back in 2004 is missing from this version, including heat haze effects and 60fps combat and town gameplay. The port appears to be based off the PS3 version which was also 30fps, but lacks the latter's fully voiced skits.\n\nIt's impossible to recommend this game in its current state. Stuttery 30fps lock, long load times, crashes and obnoxious DRM that prevents you from applying per-executable graphics settings are just the beginnings of this story. Kaldaien's patch fixes a lot of these issues, but that's not really something we should be having to mess around with.

This was easily a 60 hour game on your first playthrough, and multiple playthroughs are encouraged with the GRADE store and a fun mix of varied party members that you can switch control to at any time. It definitely still holds up, but the port is riddled with issues so far. Some of the textures would look right at home on the Gamecube, yet the framerate is locked at 30 fps. This utterly kills the pacing of battles, and makes the whole experience feel sluggish when compared to the original release, even when just walking in the overworld. Other users have had problems with startup, but I never encountered any myself.\n\nIf you ever played the Gamecube version, wait a few months until Namco patches these issues out, or until we get another fanmade patch like the one that partially redeemed Zestiria.

Still needs work either way.\n\nThings still on the list that should be fixed:\n-Invasive DRM\nWhy does this game need something that hurts the customers more than the people that pirate it, Zestiria didn't even have this kinda stuff and it was fine.\n-720p lock\nThis is just really lazy. Also just embarrassing to look at when you compare the HD mod for the Gamecube version and the PS3 version itself.\n-Alt-entering/toggling fullscreen/window is still sluggish\nI'm concerned that the game has to freeze for around 10~30 seconds to switch from/to fullscreen.

Oh, and you might crash too. Windowed is stable enough though.\n(To put it in perspective, I can run Blade and Soul on this computer right now at 60 FPS a good chunk of the time, it's a bit embarrassing to witness a game that can run fine emulated not have these issues.)\n-6 save slots\nWait...how come both the Gamecube and PS3 version have unlimited slots but this is specifically 6?\n\nWould be nice if this game was uncapped to 60 FPS but I don't think that's gonna happen because they had the opportunity to work with that on PS3, but they didn't; fingers crossed for a community mod like how Zestiria had their FPS unlock.\n\nAlso according to people on the forums, apparently now the DRM is more hidden and no more having silly fun with editing localization files.","February 1","false","0.6"," 58 of 84 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","58","84","3","0"

Anyways, that is not the issue i have with this port, nor it is why i haven't recommended the game. The problem is the amount of crashes i have suffered in the minimal amount of gameplay time. I have been crashing pretty much in a steady pace of 15 to 15 minutes. I haven't got that problem with any game. I swear, i'm not even mad at all the trouble of settings and configs i had to go through for the game to run here, i understand Bandai is not exactly a fan of things that work 100%. But i just wish it didn't crash so much, it's very aggravating to lose progress or go through those long dialogues over and over again just because of a stupid crash.\nI am begging, sitting, waiting, hoping and praying for a patch, because it pains me very much to not recommend the game i love the most in my 20 year gaming career. So yeah, if you're thinking of buying this, don't do so yet. Wait for some fixes, it's basically unplayable as it currently is, though it pains me to say so.","February 1","false","19.9"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","43","65","2","2"

The frame rate cap is a non issue but the terrible DRM and  720p resolution cap is unforgiving and looks like mud on any display above 1080p.\nWe all know this is capable of running at higher native resolutions but it has fallen within the trend of most modern day ports releasing with sub par resolution options, only to then  be fixed at a later date. This has come as no surprise to many and myself and others find it lazy on the developers part.\n\nThe game itself is fantastic having played through the original Gamecube version and thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. The story is as to be expected from any Tales game, group of heroes set out on an epic adventure to save the world, that said, it is certainly memorable thanks to the fantastic cast of characters and excellent soundtrack. The core battle mechanics work well without feeling convoluted like Tales of Zestiria's, however newer fans to the series may find the the lack of freedom during battle slightly lacklustre in comparison to the later entries.\n\nOverall it is not fundamentally broken (for me at least) and is most definately worth experiencing if you haven't played it before, the lack of care put into the port however is a huge disappointment to the fans.","February 2","false","3.7"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","35","52","0","0"

But if your only option is this PC version, I'd wait until it's patched to not suck so hard or fan fixes show up like for Zestiria.\n\nHonestly, with how decent of a port Zestiria was I thought this might have a chance to not suck. Quite disappointing.\n\nAnyways, this game is locked at an internal resolution of 720p (regardless of your monitor's rez), has no AA options and runs at 30 FPS. Not only that, but as this is the PS2 version, the graphics are noticeably worse than the original GameCube version and lack a certain aspect of it's art style. Tons of people are saying it has issues running, too. I tested on 64 bit Windows 10 with an i5 4590 and GTX 970. No issues to speak of, though I recommend playing in borderless fullscreen if you chose to play this.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth your time. One of my favorite JRPGs ever.

The Tales series is one of my favorites, so it's a special kind of insult to see that after a decade of technological improvements they actually managed to make ToS worse.\n\nDumb things:\n- The DRM system pops up error messages on launch. It logs into its own subfolder off the root directory, which no video game should ever touch. Video games shouldn't be attempting to write to high-security folders. So now I've got another software exploit vector, thanks to Shamco. Steam DRM is the most restrictive DRM that should ever be considered on the PC platform.\n- There's random empty folders in the game data folder (e.g. the "Develop" folder).\n- There's file header debug files lying around, which means their DRM system won't be nearly as effective as the file formats are documented. Thanks for wasting time and resources on that. I guess it'll make modding easier, but that's still no excuse for not cleaning up the build tree.\n- They're using Shift-JIS in 2016. A tool to convert this into Unicode can't have been *that* difficult since they're working with the original source. Since they're localizing this to multiple languages, there's really no excuse to *not* use Unicode (e.g. UTF-8).\n- Font looks sloppy due to aliasing.\n- Aliasing (jagged edges) everywhere. Ignoring the story font issues, look at the hair of the characters or the emoji bubbles over the character's heads. Even the menu background highlight is jagged. Even if they didn't want to redraw the textures, they could have run a filter over them so they didn't look so bad. Algorithms exists to do this sort of thing.\n- Some of the graphics are noticably blurry.\n- Pre-rendered movies in 720P. Unless you pick 720p, things are going to look bad. Probably explains some of the above. Have the developers not bought monitors in ten years? 1080p should be a minimum.\n- The mouse isn't hidden, but you can't click on anything.\n- Jerky animations. You can see animation slowdown in the very first schoolroom scene as it pans.\n- 10+ seconds to restore the scren after an Alt+Tab.\n- Random pauses and delays that make you think it's frozen. The original loaded data at < 4MB/s. Modern hard drives are far better than that, and yet the menus and transitions are slower. And putting a DRM engine on top so everything runs in a VM doesn't help.\n- Crashes. Of course.\n\nI'm not even listing the issues others have encountered. I'm not even sure I want to play up until the battles, given all the FPS complaints. Locking the framerate to 30 FPS is a sure sign that someone didn't care enough to do it right. The quality of this port suggests they locked their worst developer in the closet with it for 2 months and then decided to ship it anyway. I mean, Zestiria had some pretty bad launch problems, but at least it was better than this. There's no reason they can't do better than this on modern hardware. They could have done a better job than this five years ago and still had room to spare. Perhaps they're making a new game out of the perpetual race to the bottom with their product quality? Or maybe their dev team doesn't actually have computers, and they type code in on a PS3 using the gamepad? It would explain how unfamiliar they are with how a PC game should work. And the utter lack of effort.\n\nBandai product managers must have smoked themselves stupid if they think this is a decent port. Obviously product quality isn't nearly as important to them as ROI. It's entirely possible they're trying to generate free energy with this port by putting coils around their ancestors who are doubtless spinning in their graves over this travesty. Just go buy the original, or spend your money on a better game. The underlying story might be great, but you're more likely to chuck the controller through the monitor than immerse yourself in this disaster.","February 2","false","4.8"," 33 of 50 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","33","50","3","0"

These topics get explored with a fantasy view-point but are still full of meaning and impact. The story keeps going strong, with twists and turns throughout and is also VERY long - a solid 30-40 hours easily without spending the time to do everything, such as side-quests. The New Game+ system works well and helps make replaying easier and fun, something you will want to do.\n\nThe gameplay itself is a little dated compared to modern Tales games, battles don't feel as fluid and the controls a bit sluggish, there is some depth to combat but its a lot simpler than say Xillia's link system or Zestiria's Seraph system, but it is still fun and certianly passable. Exporing and puzzle sovling is never amazingly intricate but is still quite fun. To be honest, most of the modern Tales games have lacked puzzles in their dungeons entirely so its a nice change in Symphonia that they at least attempted it. There are also many sidequests and a few mini-games that aren't too bad - plenty of content to go around.\n\nAll in all, Symphonia is a classic JRPG gem that is also a reflection of the time it came out (2003). A bit dated in performance and Gameplay but with a amazing story and loveable cast of characters you will want to come back.\n\n---------\nPC PORT SPECIFIC\n---------\nThe PC port itself is somewhat a shoddy mess, however, as time is going on it is being fixed by Namco and, most importantly, modders. Thanks to Kaldaein's simple and easy to use TSFix and the removal of VMProtect, the game runs well and is perfectly playable, perhaps making it the best version of the game out there... excluding 60fps, but it s not the end of the world.","March 5","true","6.4"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","0"

The standard for us PC Gamers is 60 FPS. 30 FPS brings a bare minimum of 33.3 miliseconds of input lag. It is double the amount of input lag of 60 fps. This makes the game a little unresponsive and honestly quite annoying in an action oriented game. The gamecube version runs at 60 fps and feels so much smoother, I am gaming on windows 7 and having all kinds of problems with the loading times. Just opening up the game makes the computer feel like its gonna crash. The game freezes when I open up the ''customize'' setting in main menu and takes about 20 seconds to load.

Well remember that first puzzle where you had to push the rock blocks into the holes so you could get to the scourer's ring? Well apparently the "Pushing and Pulling" Action is Broken.

Boy was I mistaken. The thing is, it isn't inherently the game that is the problem here, it's the PC port and it's such a massive let down to see how lazy Bandai have been with porting it. As someone who is a big fan of the franchise, I can't help but be dissapointed with how awful it turned out. I think it's best we start with the biggest issue and that is the state of the PC port, because it's bloody awful.\n\nFirst things first, the frame rate is locked to 30FPS with no way to increase it. Some have managed to it get it to 40FPS but don't hold out hope for it to run at 60FPS. It's rather amusing really that a console which is more then 10 years old (The Gamecube) can run this game better then modern day powerful PC's and have the game run at 60FPS.\n\nThe resoltuion is also locked to 720p even though the game gives you the option to have it go up to 1920x1080. Putting it in 1920x1080 doesn't increase it to 1080p at all, it stays at 720p with no way to increase it without help from Durante which I'd like to point out, managed to break past the resolution lock in 14 minutes and raise the it to 4K. Yes, Durante is currently working on a fix for the game but it is starting to get to the point where we have to rely on a single person to fix something an entire company of people couldn't be bothered to do and becuase of that, they should ashamed of themselves.\n\nThere is also hidden DRM built into the game called VMProtect which creates a new *.exe file everytime you run the game which continues to baffle me still as to why that is there.\n\nIt's hard to think of all the things they messed up in this broken PC port, how about the localization? Yep, they messed that up also with differentl languages being completely broken, hell, even the english is broken with words being mispelled.\n\nBut the one thing they messed up the most, the biggest thing which I personally couldn't believe until I saw it for myself is the steam badges. They even got the steam badges wrong, which is completely unforgivable. I think that is what ruins this PC port on every level. Let's also not forget about all the crashes that stop people from down right playing the thing.\n\nAs far as PC ports go, this is by far one of the most insulting ones I've seen in a long time. They seemed to show absolutly no interest in the port which in turn, made the game worse for it and has led to a lot of unhappy customers.\n\nThe thing is, I would have loved to recommend this game, I really wanted to, but I can't with how terrible the PC port is and that hurts coming from someone who grew up playing this game 12 years ago (Did I mention this game is 12 years old?). It's unbelievable that we still have to deal with awful PC ports such as this and expect to like it or wait for someone who cares about the PC community to bring out a fix FOR FREE when an entire company who's job it is to fix this, y'know, the companies we give hundreds to every year, can't be bothered to do anything about it.\n\nThat's it, I can't recommend this as the PC port is just so awful which hurts such a great game, because behind it all, Symphonia is a great game that could've been brought to a much larger audience and introduced the series to more people as one of the best Tales Of games. Unfortunately, seemed that Bandai couldn't care less and for that, they can go felate a bee hive for all I care.","February 3","false","6.5"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

I have played and beat ToS several times on the original Gamecube.\n\nTales of Symphonia is a JRPG where Lloyd and his friends venture off to regenerate the world. This is necessary to replenish the mana to the world so that it will prosper once again. Along the way some very interesting twists and turns happen that keep the story interesting and keeps you invested in it.\n\nThe battle system is very fun as it is played in real time. You control one of the four characters on the battlefield while the AI (or a couch co-op buddy) takes control of the others. You move in a straight line twords and away from the enemy and you can jump over enemies to attack them from behind. You have your basic attack and technical attack and how you attack is determined by how you tilt the control stick and your choice between the two. New technical attacks are learned as you fight and what types of attacks are learned are determined by how you fight. You can trigger full party unison attacks as well as special character attacks that deal a lot of damage. While this system is nothing fancy it still has a bit of depth to keep you wanting more.\n\nAll in all Tales of Symphonia is a fantastic RPG to start at or just play as I find it has everything that an RPG enthusiast would find fun. The only thing is though that the port quality is pretty bad.\n\nUnfortunately though I cannot recommend the PC/Steam version of the game. As this port is nothing but a straight port of the PS3 version. Absolutely no work was put into it.\n\nBasically since this is a ps3 port it runs at 30fps when the original version on the gamecube ran at 60fps except on the world map. Personally this doesn't bother me much but it does take some getting use to.\n\nNext the game only renders at 720p meaning that if you raise the resolution to 1080p you will still see plenty of jaggies and blurry textures because the game is upscaling that 720p to whatever resolution you set it to.\n\nOne major problem that Bandai Namco fixed however was the removal of the Anti-Tamer software known as VMProtect. It did nothing but cause problems for many users because of how it works, but it was removed in a patch.\n\nAll in all if you can get past the technical issues in this barest of bones port the game runs fairly well and is the exact same Tales of Symphonia that we all know and love minus the 60 fps. It is still a really good and fun RPG to play, I just wish that Bandai Namco added basic PC functionality to the game. Like rendering the game at the actual resolution and some basic graphic options such as anti-aliasing, shadow quality, texture quality and such.\n\nIn the end though I cannot recommend this game as nothing was done to make it any better than the PS3 port, and that it lacks anything that would make it a good port. It could have been the definitive version of the game but Bandai Namco didn't even try.\n\nThe good news is that modders are working on the game to make it better. I just wish that we wouldn't have to resort to modders to fix a bad port.\n\nTL:DR - if you can look past the technical issues of the game it is still very fun to play. I just wish that Bandai Namco put a little more effort into the port.","February 2","false","3.2"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","17","27","0","0"

Sure there are some things you can try to get it to work. I tried a couple. But, ultimately if I wanted to put effort into doing those things and finding the information and putting it all together then I'd rather just use my emulator that I've already had setup for a couple years now. The sole reason I purchased this game on steam was to have the game run better than what I've already achieved on my emulator. As it stands now all I've got with this is a bunch of wasted hard drive space and an extra set of words jumbled in with the rest of the games in my library.

The game is playable, but the port has many issues making this a 'do not buy.' It's ridiculously tedious to run around the main map. Input from a controller is not consistent. I can deal with the graphics, but the fact that they left them in a decade old state definitely shows during play. Even the cutscenes are grainy. Voices for charaters (where they exist) sometimes cut out in the middle of a sentence. I do prefer this combat system to the new one in Tales of Zestiria, but there are some major issues with the targetting. Sometimes targetting an enemy will make him invincible, until you defeat another enemy.\n\nI feel that this game borders on shovelware, because it was promised as a pre-order bonus. The updates for this game have been really small and do not address the major issues. For the potential for the port to not recieve any major updates (as they did with Zestiria, letting the community fix it), I can't recommend this game. It is not likely that anything will be fixed, and with the DRM the community won't be able to do anything.\n\n3/1/2016\n\nThe game now no longer launches, because TOS.exe is considered a virus by multiple antivirus programs.The newest update messed things up.","February 13","false","2.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Everyone interested in RPGs owes it to themselves to experience this one.\nBut I'm not here to talk about the story, combat, or any of that. This game has been around for years. This version has not. I'm here to talk about this port. I got some bad news, kids... Namco is stealing your money.\n\nGranted, I got this one for free because of Zestiria, but I'm still going to be very critical of it because it somehow costs $20.\n\nThis is not a good PC port. This is a joke. I at least expected the port quality of Valkyria Chronicles, especially after Zesteria wasn't that bad in terms of PC settings, resolution, and all that. It had issues for a lot of users, but worked fine for me. Not so with Symphonia. This port is up ♥♥♥♥ creek with a turd for a paddle.\n\nThis game is still rendering at 1280x720. Any res higher than that does nothing for the quality of the game's textures. On my 2560x1440 monitor this game looks like ♥♥♥. Not to mention it is STILL 30fps locked. Hopefully modders can give us a 60fps fix like they did with Zestiria even after all of Namco's crap about "it has to be 30fps" because of animation timing and frame data". The only setting you can change in the game is resolution. Not that anything higher than 1280x720 will affect anything. No Vsync, NO ANTIALIASING (WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ DOES IT NOT HAVE THIS, IT'S 2016!?!?!??!), no render distance setting (yep, the overworld still looks gross).\n\nAs far as quality PC ports go, this one is not even close. This is a Square Enix move. This is why RPGs need devs with skill and motivation to succeed on PC. This game does not get a free pass just because it's a time-honored, great classic, nor because I love it. PC ports should not be crap. Not for a game this loved and respected. This game deserved care and quality and got a steaming pile of crap instead.\n\nDo not buy. Absolutely do play it though. I would rate it thumbs up because I absolutely recommend Symphonia. Just not this version. Not at all. Get the PS3 version with the two games in one. This port is trash, and gets the thumbs down.

If you are looking for 60fps then this game will probably never receive it. If you are only interested in 60 fps or greater then go with the GC version. The PC version has all the content from the PS2/3 release with it being graphically superior compared to the GC with the HD textures and the PS2/3 version.\n\nThis is with the fix however. If you don't use the fix it runs at 720p and the game stutters.\n\nAs for the actual game itself.\n\nThe battle mechanics definitely show their age. I wouldn't call them bad but you can tell that this was an early attempt into shifting to a 3D plane.\n\nThe story is one of the best in the series with enjoyable characters to boot.\n\nIf you use the english voices then you will note that some voiced sections have some character not actually speaking, this is because this game is based on the PS2 port which was Japanese only which added certain things to the game. If you switch the audio over to Japanese these sections are voiced.  The voice acting for the english side of it is a mixed bag and if you switch over to the Japanese side an important note is that one of your party members has a very obvious name change. Raine -> Refill (リフィル literally Rifiru).\n\nThe start of the game having played it again is kind of on a slow boil but it starts picking up 6 hours in. Again having replayed this game sometimes the objective might come off cryptic to some people. The main objective of regenerating the world comes to mind. While this is what you need to do the game doesn't flat out tell you where you need to go. While I never had any trouble with this, having seen some of my relatives play this game and ask, "where do I go next?" is something that I thought might be note worthy.\n\nThere are only 2 dungeons in this game that I would classify as tedious with one more that could be considered. Which are  the sewers, forest of the elves, and shadow temple with the Shadow Temple and the sewers being what I considered tedious.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game.","May 4","true","26.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Really? Cant you make it more adept to today's technology and make it HD or something? While I'm glad that someone's making a fix for it, but this is stupid.\n\n-Crashing Errors tends to be Specific. While for some people it crashes on Startup(This is my problem too), and for some when accessing the options menu in-game, I found out my copy ALSO crashes whenever I shift-tab to access the In-Game Steam Overlay Interface when I want to talk to a friend. Because of this I had to turn off Fullscreen via changing the config with Notepad so I can both play the game and chat with my friends, and it's fustrating. VERY fustrating.\n\n-Cannot use Mouse for Menu UI Interaction. Come on, guys, if you're gonna make a PC port, ATLEAST add Mouse Compatibility and Functionability. It makes navigating through menus such a breeze with Mouse Control, and it doesn't feel...clunky.\n\n-The Framerate. DEAR LORD, THE FRAMERATE! I understand that the PS3 and PS2 ports weren't the greatest, but if you're gonna port it to the PC(#PCMasterRace), atleast optimize it so that it wont be completely and udderly craptacular.\n\nThese are overall the main reasons why I feel like I wasted my money buying this Port of one of my childhood games. I'm honestly Disappointed with this port. Kinda wish I could get a refund because i'm not happy with this product. Until they actually put effort to make this piece-of-crap port of one of the most memorable games ACTUALLY playable and more PC-Friendly, I'd say spend your money somewhere else.

If you've already played the later entries like Vesperia, Xillia or even that terrible Graces F then you'll probably find yourself at a disadvantage with the combat--That of which Tales usually excels at isn't that good. I personally also find the lack of voice acting for the skits to be distracting quite a bit, given voice acting exists pretty much everywhere else in the game--Sure, the game is old but so is Final Fantasy X and it had plenty of voice acting--But getting into the voice acting, I'd dare say that isn't up to standards either which only serves to highlight the game's inexorable ♥♥♥♥-dribling old age. I suppose not all old games could carry themselves quite as well  in terms of voice direction as Metal Gear, ironic given the narration is being done by Liquid Snake (Cam Clarke) but I digress.\n\nIn a world where an excellent port of a great JRPG like Valkyria Chronicles exist, Symphonia plays the role of the dog poo located next to a firmly build brick-house. You'd be much better off playing that or getting the PS3 Remaster of Symphonia and then get an addiotional game in the package as well.\nTales of Symphonia might be a really good game, but I dare say its age is showing and awful messy port-job does little to help justify, even warrant, it worthy as a good purchase.","February 3","false","0.2"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

It's mostly the same great game from 15 years ago. It's even playable, in English. Co-op is still included, even if the Steam page doesn't mention it. But at this point I'm not going to recommend it.\n\nThe problem is that this is a straight PS3 port - anything that was wrong with that version is still wrong in this version - new stuff (and even some old stuff!) being translated oddly or just plain wrong, 30FPS lock from the PS2 version, etc. There are no PC-specific graphics options, and the game will render at a 720p resolution regardless of what you set your resolution to; on top of that it seems some sort of extra blur was added. Additionally, the framerate limiter makes it hard to consistently hit 30FPS on good (modern) hardware. It's been over a month since the last patch (which mostly served to remove the useless DRM limiting outside modifications, probably a sign of the devs throwing in the towel), so the odds of these being officially fixed are next to none.\n\nIt's certainly better now than it was at launch, but it's be ridiculously hard for them to make it worse. The fact that any mention of multiplayer was scrubbed from the Steam page implies that most of the game wasn't even tested before being sold.\n\nThe bottom line: It's a great game, but a terrible port. I can't recommend it at $20 until it's actually had $20 of effort put into it; if I'm expected to pay as much as a competent port of a similarly-aged game, I expect to get a competent port. I'll be more than happy to update my review if or when any of these issues are addressed. In the meantime, buy the PS3 version of Tales of Symphonia Chronicles - it's the same price, it consistently works the way it's supposed to, and includes the (admittedly disappointing) sequel.","February 2","false","33.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

While the story itself wasn't that special, it's storytelling quite compelling and the characters were charming. Gameplay were fluid and fun, so normally I would recommend everyone that cares even a bit about JRPG or RPGs in general, buuut\n\nUnfortunately this port is just a mess, and thus I do recommend to keep away from this until they fix this.\nFirstly, as expected, this game runs on 30fps (even thought the original GCN version supposedly ran on 60). I would be fine with that, if it weren't for all the other issues, and apparently this game runs for some people on 40fps. Since the game mechanics are bound to fps, this means that for those people the game rums 33% faster.\nEven thought there is a resolution option for up to 4k (for me at least), the game's internal rendering resolution is locked to 720p. That means no matter what resolution you are playing at, the game always looks the same.\nTo make things worse, this game uses a DRM called "VMProtect". It creates a new exe on each start and runs on a virtual system. This comes with a lot of different problems: Slow startup and alt+tab time, probably no way for modifications, and you can't force any options through your graphic drivers. And apparently it also includes even more DRM systems as well.\nAnd of course, the game comes with plenty of other bugs and crashes you can expect at release: Game crashes at startup or when accessing the option menu, (very!) long loading times when opening save menu and corrupted/broken text when playing in french language.If you want to know more about those issues, there are plenty of threads going around for each of them.\n\nThey did a quite good job on Zestiria (there were still some issues, but it was still a "good" port), but what they did to this game is just sad. Luckily I got this game as a pre-order bonus for zestiria, otherwise I would have refunded the game immediately.","February 2","false","1.6"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","15","26","2","0"

I've recently heard they use additional DRM beyond Steam, someone I read on neogaf was claiming it recreates the .exe file every time you start the game...?!  Regardless of what it does specifically, you have to recognize the insanity of putting DRM on a minimal-effort port of a game that's been out on PS3 for years, and with an easily emulatable GCN version--all DRM like this does is potentially punish legitimate users like me and you, while the people that illegitimately downloaded the game did so and probably finished it YEARS ago.  Those pirates?  I doubt they'll be wanting this version--that's how little this adds in terms of quality to the experience we've already had for years.\n-More typos than ever?  The PS3 version didn't have a great localization, there were typos here and there, but this one takes the cake.  "Battle Contorols," missing quotation marks, and more, all in the first five minutes of my playtime today.\n-Limited to 6 save slots in the save menu apparently?","February 1","false","0.2"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","19","34","0","0"

Nearly all of the things wrong with the port are EASILY fixable. The only unfixable problem is the 30fps lock, but that can still be increased to 40 fps doing a couple tricks. This game is a classic and received a 4.5/5 on Metacritic.\n\nShould they have had some sort of QA team fixing all this stuff?\nYes, but that doesn't stop you from walking on your own two legs.\n\nI highly recommend buying the game and using GeDoSaTo Tool from Durante to fix the issues. Change the game to compatibility mode for Windows XP. This will increase the fps to 40 and has worked on all three of the computers I have tried it on. If you get annoyed by stuttering, go back to GeDoSaTo and set the fps limit to 30 and there won't be anymore frame stuttering. The stuttering already exists when you don't use compatibility mode so even if you don't care about getting ten more frames per second, I reccommend using this trick to make the game smoother. If none of this works for you you can still refund the game.\n\n","March 20","true","74.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I owned a GameCube, but ultimately decided the console wasn't worth constantly plugging and unplugging and let it gather dust because PS2, so I passed up on this title. Over ten years later, I ended up preordering Zestiria to get the bonus Symphonia and see what the fuss was about.\n\nToS launched in a deplorable state. Bamco launched the highly anticipated port of one of their most beloved titles as an unstable, buggy mess, which I'm pretty sure violates several Dwarven Vows. Months later, they finally updated it into a workable, playable game that doesn't require a fan-made mod to not be awful (but still helps).\n\nThe story initially revolves around a trio of friends: a swordsman named Lloyd, a tolerable child mage named Genis, and Colette, the "Chosen of Mana". The mercenary Kratos and their teacher, Raine, soon join up. Colette is foretold to regenerate the world and save humanity from the Desians, half-elves who keep humans in work camps and see themselves as a superier race. The story quickly complicates as more characters appear and the story unfolds.\n\nThe battles are real-time. You target an enemy, move away or close the distance. One button allows you to use standard attacks while another uses one of four assigned special attacks depending on whether or not you use it with a directional button. The result is a fast and fun system that allows and rewards combos. The characters you don't control can have their AI customized and specific attacks disabled. Stat growth can also be influenced by assigning "titles", which are awarded by story events or in-game achievements.\n\nThe game starts out sticking closely to its tropes before throwing them out the window. How it bends and twists things were more novel at its launch, but many of them aren't as special now that other games have done the same. The game also doesn't do the best job of hiding some of its twists, or simply foreshadows far too hard. The writing and voice acting is still solid, and certain parts WILL leave you feeling emotional.\n\nThe game is stable and plays very well, and TSFix (check the forums) enhances it further. The 30 FPS cap is still annoying, but tolerable. The game has aged well, and I found myself wanting to hurry home so I could resume playing it. I've come to kick myself for not buying it back when it was new.

Over the last few hours I've been playing, I've been squinting at slowdowns, howling at badly jagged lines, and being narked at the way this game has just apparently been copied and pasted onto a PC.

I own the game on every possible device it has been released on. I own the GC, PS2, PS3 and now the PC version of the game and have poured probably thousands of hours into this title. You would think that as the time passes and technology progresses that these old games would only get better when they are remade for newer console. But that's not the case with Tales of Symphonia. To put it shortly the PC version is just one ugly mess.\n\nPros:\n- Dual audio\n- PS2 version extra content, few skins and bunch added hi-ougis (or mystic artes as they like to call them)\n\nCons:\n- Locked 30 FPS even if the very first version on the Gamecube was solid and smooth 60 FPS\n- Capped internal resolution of 720p (the year is 2016 btw and this is PC we are talking about)\n- Crashes at startup, crashes when trying to access the customize menu, crashes alt+tabbing, crashes whenever it feels like\n- Horrible translation errors in coding, letters missing or generally completely bugged menus\n- Some kind of VMProtect to act as an additional DRM (yay) which changes the running .exe name and prevents stuff form Nvidia cp AND makes it even harder for modders to fix the damn game\n- No support for mouse and keyboard\n\nI would NOT recommend this version of the game to anyone. It's just a shameless act from Namco and no one should give them money for this kind of blatant robbery. I love the game itself, I really do. As I mentioned in the beginning I have it for every system and if you truly want the DEFINITE version of the game then the original Gamecube version if the way to go. It does lack a tiny amount of content (not a big deal, few skins and few mystic artes), but it's simply the most solid and smoothest experience of the game. Dolphin with the grapchical enhancements has been the most wonderful experience I've had with this game.\n\ntl;dr: The game itself is one of the best games I've ever played, but the PC port is one of the worst ports I've ever played.

Bandai-Namco has released several patches that fix a lot of the localization errors and button prompts, as well as removed the invasive anti-tamper software. In addition, if you use Kaldaien's TSfix mod (found in the guides for this game) then the game is definitively the best version of the game. Resolution errors are fixed, load times are reduced, borderless window support, it's great. The only nitpick that still exists in the game at that point would be the 30 fps lock. However, it's still enjoyable at that point.\n\nThat being said, I can now confidantly change my review to positive with the caveat that you go and download Kaldaien's TSfix.\n\n\nOld review:\n\nAn absolute train wreck of a release. Aside a myriad of technical issues, the game doesn't even improve upon the 13 year old GC version. There are no graphics options of any kind and it is not recommended that you play on any resolution aside from the starting 1280x720. Otherwise you will see stretching, tearing, and aliasing. The game is locked at 30 fps instead of the 60 seen on the GameCube version, which feels extremely sluggish when the two are compared.\n\nAnd to put the cherry atop it all: there are translation and grammar errors as soon as the main menu.\n\nI love Tales of Symphonia. It's probably my favorite in the series. But I must caution you away from this port. It is not worth $20 until it is fixed. If you want to play ToS on PC then getting an emulator for the original GC version is your best bet. Worse than being a poor port the PC version of the game is inferior to the GC version in nearly every way and is a technical mess.","February 1","true","26.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Changing my review to Recommend.\n\nEdit 3: VMProtect is gone, it no longer runs a new .exe file every time, and with that my last complaint is gone! I am now QUITE satisfied with this game, and extremely happy to be able to play ToS on my PC! Removing negative review below, 'cause ALL of my issues have been addressed! Definately recommend any Tales fan or anyone looking for a good point to pick up the Tales series from start with Symphonia! Great characters, interesting world and story, and the Tales batle system has always been one of my favorites. And Symphonia has always been my favorite Tales game!","February 11","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I find the Normal difficulty on the right spot, but it has two higher difficulty levels if you desire to make it more challenging, which is great for replays. Yes, another strong point of the game, is its replayability.\n\nThe sound isn't that special. Some catchy tunes, but that's it. It is voiced in the right moments with good english voices, though they rarely synchronize with the speaking mouths. It doesn't bother me, but it could be worth noting.\n\nThe story isn't very complex in the beginning, but later it gets more interesting, when everything starts trying to make sense. Every character has their own dramatic backstory, that makes their personalities very different to each other.\n\nIf I had to give it a score, I'd say 8.5 out of 10. I definitely recommend it, specially if it's on sales.","May 5","true","30.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The port isn't bad in my opinion. I have had none of the problems people post about here on my PC. Although I do have a pretty higher end rig with a GTX 970 8GB MSI. I don't mind the lower frames entirely. It moves same as the GC versions... even that graphic lag in the world map has ALWAYS been there since first ToS game. It only happens when enemies spawn on the map though (probably loading the type of enemies you would fight should you touch them so battles can run seemlessly with almost 0 load time). All in all I shall give this port A 7/10 just because they refuse to try and fix some of the bugs that have been in the game since the first version. Easily A 10/10 if they would have enhanced it visually or performance wise in some way or at least given the option to switch it back and forth like most PC games do.

In fact I think the game looks great.  Sure it could look better but who cares,  Anytime there's glowing reviews of a retro pixel game, it's pretty much unanimously agreed upon that graphics aren't important - it's gameplay and/or story that matters - but as soon as a game is locked at 30 fps everyone is outraged.\n\nI realize that I'm reviewing this game after several patches, and I know that upon the games release, it was kind of a mess, and I know that the original GameCube version looked better, but I don't care.  As it is now, I think the game looks and runs great and I have no complaints.\n\nAs of this writing, I've only put a half hour into the game, mainly to see how it looked, so there may be plenty of bugs and glitches ahead.  If that's true I'll change my review, but I wanted to add my two cents to the uproar about how the game looks.\n\nIn short, I think the game looks good and don't feel that that should be a hinderance in anyone's decision to buy it.

I share the disappointment of it being locked to 30 fps so it's a little difficult to play it that way after playing the GameCube version.  But there are many other factors in making a game great and 60 fps is just one of them.\n\nThe GameCube lacked big budget JRPGs and TOS used this to show us Westerners that there are more JRPGs out there than Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.  If it wasn't for the GameCube version, I wouldn't have gotten into the Tales JRPGs until much later if ever.\n\nThe story is good and it starts to run out of steam near the end but what JRPG storyline doesn't run out of steam at some point in the game?  The story alone was good enough for me.  The graphics look good for a HD remake of a GC game but dude, if I could play in 60 fps with 480p graphics, I would do that.  I believe a mod will eventually fix that framerate issue much to the joy of everyone.\n\nI would still recommend this game but just barely.  If the 60 fps mode arrives, I'd strongly recommend it.

The answer is not just 'No', with a capital N, but 'HELL NO', in all caps.\n\nIf you would like further edification, I will simply post below what I wrote when I requested my refund. But if you need no further information, then I cannot emphasize enough that this game SHOULD NOT BE PURCHASED.\n\n-----\n\nI'm choosing this option ('My issue isn't listed') because this port has too many various, unforgivably terrible issues. It's a game that originally ran on the Nintendo Gamecube at 60 fps, which is now locked at 720p + 30fps. It had numerous crashes and no mouse/keyboard support on launch. These are issues that will likely be fixed in the future but should have been fixed before the game was ever launched.\n\nThis is my favorite game from my childhood, and seeing it reduced to this state when I was hoping to relive that experience with at least moderately updated visual quality and new content. I could easily have never bought this and played it on an emulator for that purpose, but I chose to pay for this because I want classic games such as this to continue being ported. What I got instead was a heap of haphazard garbage that even an independent modder could have produced with more quality.\n\nThis is an instance of blatant disrespect not just towards the fans and customers, but to their own series. It is clear that there was little to no effort made in producing this port. Since initially it was a 'free' game for pre-ordering Tales of Zestria, why would they waste money improving it, right?\n\nI hope that in the future, Steam will hold its clients accountable for such incredible lack of effort in porting games from console releases. There have already been the catastrophies that Arkham Knight and Mortal Kombat X's launches were, and now another highly significant port has been destroyed by nothing more than gross apathy from the title's owners.\n\nIn closing, this is unacceptable garbage. This would unacceptable even if I had received it for 'free' by pre-ordering Tales of Zestria, but asking for twenty dollars for this level of quality is insulting.","February 2","false","0.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I share the disappointment of it being locked to 30 fps so it's a little difficult to play it that way after playing the GameCube version.  But there are many other factors in making a game great and 60 fps is just one of them.\n\nThe GameCube lacked big budget JRPGs and TOS used this to show us Westerners that there are more JRPGs out there than Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.  If it wasn't for the GameCube version, I wouldn't have gotten into the Tales JRPGs until much later if ever.\n\nThe story is good and it starts to run out of steam near the end but what JRPG storyline doesn't run out of steam at some point in the game?  The story alone was good enough for me.  The graphics look good for a HD remake of a GC game but dude, if I could play in 60 fps with 480p graphics, I would do that.  I believe a mod will eventually fix that framerate issue much to the joy of everyone.\n\nI would still recommend this game but just barely.  If the 60 fps mode arrives, I'd strongly recommend it.  It's just a little difficult to play the game in 30 fps after playing it in 60 fps but it's still worth it.","February 2","true","1.9"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","18","36","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mesarthim/recommended/372360/","Mesarthim","Mesarthim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mesarthim/","68 products in account","So let's count the number of problems the game had on release:\n\n1. Massive save delay on Windows 7, fixed.\n2. Massive Config menu delay, fixed.\n3. 720p resolution regardless what you choose, fixed by a mod otherwise it gets blurry at high res.\n4. Startup crashes. Assumed fixed as VMprotect was removed among other technical changes.\n5. Different languages were a mess as there were typos introduced and languages were mixed up. Fixed.\n6. Inconsistent button prompts (PS3 buttons in PC version). Fixed.\n7. The most hated part of the port was VMprotect as it spat out a new temporary executable every time it launched, causing driver overrides to not work or obscured the game from being fixed easily. However before its removal it was mostly circumvented by a modder fixing the game. Its removal was silent but thankful.\n8. Initially the port came with all of six save slots. I personally do not use that many but they have patched it to be 100 save slots. Anyone who has a gripe with only six can now rest easy.\n9. Alt tabbing fullscreen used to take an average of 17 seconds or more or could even crash the game. This however has been patched.\n10. The game is still 30 fps and is unlikely to be fixed. Author of Tsfix isn't going to fix it either.\n11. Initially the game had even more quality issues such as the Zelos Badge being called a Mithos Badge as was the emoticon. I haven't stared at either since around launch but I have read that this inconsistency was fixed silently.\n\nIf Namco ever tries this again they can expect their sales to tank. They chose the cheapest option of porting Symphonia and the launch quality showed that. I imagine Berseria, the next game in the series, will be of higher quality as it is a new game and will not be subjected to zero quality assurance like this port of Symphonia received. They will most likely do preorders for Berseria as well so keep your eyes peeled for any "tier" nonsense as if they offer another free Tales game do not assume it will be ported good.\n\nExcuse me while I beat my face on my desk. I'm sure my desk can port my face into a new shape better than Namco did on this port.\n\nI am including a mandatory article read:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/broken-pc-ports-like-tales-of-symphonia-are-unacceptable/\n\nI am changing this review to positive now since it's no longer a trainwreck and only because a certain modder was fixing the game up as well as the developers. I was reluctant to do so but the most major of issues has been fixed, be it a mod or otherwise, so I have little reason to negatively view the game anymore. Keep in mind that I am only now viewing the game as positive due to the existence of Kal's mod. If you're not using Tsfix or have no intention of using the mod you may still want to avoid it.\n\nStop being cheap Namco otherwise the community can and will Demon Fang you in return as the store page is still struggling to get out of the 50% positive range.","February 1","true","46.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vosse/recommended/372360/","Vosse","BONKERS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vosse/","428 products in account","Bandai Namco has hit a new low with an abysmal and unfinished port of arguably the most well known "Tales of" game of all time.\nTales of Symphonia was promised to all whom pre-ordered Tales of Zestiria if enough people pre-ordered it.\n\nObviously we all know now, that this was all one gigant SCAM by Bamco.\nAnd just furthers the notion to  Stop Pre-Orderng Games.\nTales of Zestiria and Symphonia PC are PRIME examples of this.  Scamco had all of our money before it was even done. So why bother actually putting in effort?\n\nTales of Zestiria thankfully mostly turned out OK but was fundamentally broken in several important areas. And when something WAS patched, they traded one crash for another and really didn't fix anything. The patches got further apart and just stopped.\n\nOther Ocean[otherocean.com] (The people who ported USFIV to PS4. Remember how bad that port was at launch?) is the studio whom ported the game, but they can't take all the blame. This is BANDAI NAMCO's game, it is THEIR responsibility to make sure things get done.And make sure they get done right.\n(Which to the point shows that Capcom actually stepped up and fixed USFIV's sorry ♥♥♥ on PS4 after OO launched it essentially broken )\nAnd Scamco has done nothing. You get what you pay for Scamco. You want a top notch port done for ♥♥♥♥ and pennies. Well here is the result.\n\nThis port is essentially ALL cons, they only get credit for one thing. Removing VMProtect. Every other patch has almost broken or introduced another big problem, with;like Zestiria; each patch getting further and further apart.\nAnd here we are over a MONTH since the last patch without a SINGLE line of communication, still with a half done broken port.\n\n\nCons\nVirtually no communication with users on any patches\nLocked Internal Resolution to 720p, even though it has resolution selection\nNo Anti Aliasing. Adding in AA was impossible until Kaldaien added MSAA to TSFix, alternatively when VMProtect was removed you could force AA on Nvidia cards.\nNot recommended though because of Scamco's incompetence with the blur filter added via a patch.\nGame has an additional Post Processing buffer for things like Bloom (That AFIK isn't the same in the PS3 version), in exactly the same format as Tales of Zestiria. Meaning it's ridiculously low resolution and causes all kinds of flickering and crawling.\nTSFix fixes this.\nLocked 30FPS with same broken framelimiter as Zestiria. Original GCN game ran at 60FPS everywhere but World Map\nWith no internal effort to even try. Unlike with ToZ, which Kaldaien was able to pick up and fix.\nI really think the reason Tales of Zestiria was released with a 30 FPS cap was because QLOC was battling with Namco's horrendous framerate limiter. It can't even do 30 FPS correctly, much less 60.\n\nThey did a lot of work behind the scenes that's really difficult to do with just assembly language code. Thanks to their work at a more reasonable level (C++ code), it was pretty easy to get 60 FPS stable in Zestiria. It's not even easy to get it to happen period in Symphonia, much less iron out kinks such as collision detection :-\ Which means 60FPS mod is not coming\nTons of localization errors in every language with wrong fonts used and all manner of issues (See list in comments or this thread\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/372360/discussions/0/412446292769130296/?ctp=6\nJust look at the huge list of text and voice bugs/typos.)\nLocalization file openly exposed at launch. Which allowed some to fix the giant errors by Other Ocean\nSaid file was removed in early patch. Good luck getting the rest of the problems fixed lol. If they won't do it. No one can. And there are a LOT.\nLaunched with not ONLY DRM (That was defeated DAY 1 by pirates), but with VMProtect[vmpsoft.com] ON TOP of it.\nTo quote from the website\nVMProtect Virtualizes Code\nCode virtualization is the next step in software protection. Most protection systems encrypt the code and then decrypt it at the application’s startup. VMProtect doesn’t decrypt the code at all! Instead, the encrypted code runs on a virtual CPU that is markedly different from generic x86 and x64 CPUs as the command set is different for each protected file.\nDue to the growing number of 64-bit systems, it is essential that the protector supports them. We added the support of 64-bit applications, libraries and drivers in 2007, so everything is tested well and you can easily migrate to 64 bits.\nBoth 32 and 64-bit versions are supported and there are no problems with DEP or UAC.\nVMProtect Is A Complete Protection SolutionIn short, it does absolutely nothing to protect what is a SP game from piracy or anything. As it was pirated and still running with VMP with no issue at all.\nAll it serves as is a "♥♥♥♥ you, to whom may try to mod and fix our game. HOW DARE YOU"\nVMProtect completely disabled the ability to make a driver profile and tweak things like Texture Filtering, force proper Vsync, add Antialiasing and the like.\nLaunched partially using Playstation button icons. http://i.imgur.com/woCqFlH.png (Lmao)\nRather than patching it so you can switch between Xbox and PS icons. They removed all PS buttons and left in only Xbox buttons\nLaunched with only 6 save slots\nAt launch opening the config and save menu could take 30 seconds to load.\nThe person in charge of the Steam Discussion forum at launch was a guy named "Lazy Mofo", promptly changed his name some few days later\nOutline Cel Shading still missing from GCN original. Even though it took a whole few minutes for a modder to add it in and another few days of work by someone else to make it work 100% correctly.\nhttp://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison.php?id=161893List continued in comments. Start at the oldest comments.\n\nDon't support dishonest and disrespectful work from companies like Bandai Namco when they treat their own game and their userbase like ♥♥♥♥.","April 13","false","0.6"," 20 of 41 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","20","41","0","16"

And it's very easy to see why: the story is great, the characters are VERY memorable and well developed, the combat system is amazing... there's almost nothing wrong with this game. Sure, there are some chichés here and there, some cringe-worthy dialogues... but all that is easy to forgive when the game feels so special.\n\nFor the ones that don't know, the Tales of... games are a series of Japanese RPGs with big emphasis on character development and the storyline. The stories are full of fantasy, and usually blends drama and comedy in a fantastic and natural way. The game WILL make you laugh and cry throughout the journey, and nothing feels forced.\n\nThe combat system is not turn based, like most JRPGs. Instead, you control one character directly in an action based combat kinda similar to fighting games (but more simplistic). The other characters are controlled by the AI, and this AI can be configured to work like you want it to. Also, in battles, you can open the menu at any time and give orders to the secondary characters. As long as they aren't being attacked, they will obbey your orders. It's a very good system, since it keeps the strategy of most JRPGs, while being more dynamic than turn based combat.\n\nThis version of the game is based on the PS3 version, meaning we can choose between Japanese and English voiced, there are more skills and clothes, etc.\n\nYes, this is a great game. However...\n\n\n-THE PC PORT:\n\nThe PC port is not very good. First of all, it's locked at 30 FPS. That may not bother everyone, so you are free to ignore this part of my review, but the fact is that this game should be 60 FPS. Heck, it was 60 FPS on the Gamecube! Also, it's locked at a 720p internal resolution, meaning the game will look pixelated. But you can use TSFix, an unnofficial fix created by Kaldaien, to make the game render at any desired resolution.\n\nLastly, the port seems to have quite a few stability issues for a few people. I got lucky, since the game is VERY stable in here, but some people are complaining about crashes, so I recommend that, if you buy it, you test it as soon as you can, before the refund window closes.\n\n\nAnyway. I'm still recommending this game. Fact is, even though it's a weak PC port, the game itself is just amazing, and DESERVES a playthrough. And thanks to Kaldaien (creator of TSFix), we can use higher resolutions to make the game look better, among other things. You can even use MSAA to make the game look amazing at any resolution you choose. ^^","February 10","true","67.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

A bit better; I'm glad they're at least working on it. Going from utterly disappointed to reasonably disappointed. Haven't played this in probably a week, so I don't know if input lag has been fixed, but if it has, then I'll consider changing my review to a positive. But then again, still no ability to change the quality of the game.\n\nUtterly disappointed. Came here to make my voice heard, as the evident lack of care put into this project only deserves to be made known to potential buyers. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME at its current state. Wait until reasonable fixes have been made, until the "Recent Reviews" have become more positive.\n\nA free copy of Tales of Symphonia was probably the deciding factor in my pre-order of Tales of Zestiria, and although it's great that Symphonia's now on Steam, just because I really enjoy Symphonia doesn't mean I'm going to sugarcoat anything.\n\nPossible language translations missing. Resolution locked at 720p, and no effective means of quality control. The badges are even misnamed as of current (I believe the "Mithos Badge" has a picture of Zelos on it. Really, guys? For shame). And DO NOT even get me started on the 30 FPS lock.\n\nOne of the things I've personally observed is the input lag in the game. I have a medium/high-end computer. This game was on the Gamecube. There should NOT be any input lag. As many people have continued to state, Gamecube still remains the best version of the game currently.\n\nI'm not going to allow Bamco and Temco to pass off one of the greatest jRPGs on Steam in this state, so that potential buyers and people interested in the Tales series end up disappointed from their experience. They deserve a lot better.\n\nTL;DR Don't buy this game yet. Way too many bugs that are for sure on the developers' side of fault. Wait for developers and modders to turn this around. Consumers: Tales fans, potential buyers and people interested in the Tales series deserve way better than what is provided as of current.","February 2","false","75.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Hearing it would be coming to Steam featuring the content included in the PS2/PS3 rerelease was exciting news. I adore this game, and I'm still going to play it even though it needs some serious patching.\n\nBut in its current state, I can't recommend it to anyone quite yet. I'd love to change the review to something more positive once some of the most glaring issues have been addressed, many of which have been mentioned by other reviewers:\n\nThe game is prone to freezing and/or crashing when you try and select the customization/options menu in both the title screen and in-game. Every time I've attempted going into it, the game immediately locks up. Not good.\nI thought I would be able to live with the 30 fps, but it looks ugly as sin, and the difference between this version and the original Gamecube version's framerate is extremely jarring. It doesn't look too bad in some areas, but the delays it causes in the battle system (which is a huge part of the game) are frustrating.\nThere's a bunch of typos I don't recall being in the Gamecube release. I've played that version 20+ times and originally I thought they had just copy/pasted the original English text, but there's typos and grammatical errors in this version I am positive weren't in the original English release.\nA minor issue, but the soundfont for the soundtrack seems significantly different between this version and the Gamecube version. Can't decide if this is a pro or a con.\nPlease fix the crashing issues especially, Bandai Namco, and please take into account what people are saying about this game's port. A lot of people, myself included, are huge fans of this game, love it dearly, and only want the best for it so both old and new fans have better access to it from the start.","February 2","false","46.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There are many issues with this port that hinder the game experince. Personally I don't care about the 30fps vs. 60fps stuff, so it running in 30 doesn't bother me, but I know it will others.

The 30FPS lock seems to be an unfixable issue, but considering this is a straight port from the PS3 (which in turn is a port from the PS2), it kinda sucks that they couldn't take that cap off. This is PC gaming, Namco. You don't have to cheap out by making a straight console port and changing almost nothing. The GameCube ran this game better 13 years ago, but it's still playable at 30FPS, albeit nowhere near as crisp as the GCN release. At the end of the day, this is still Tales of Symphonia, and it's a fantastic game in a beloved and underrated series that everyone should play. But if you can, try to get this game at a reduced price- the GameCube original is still somewhat reasonably priced these days, and $20 for this port just seems too steep for such a cheap port.","May 22","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My game crashed once during a cutscene in my 118 hours of play. Other than that, I haven't experienced any technical issues. If you haven't played the game before and are looking for an overview, here are some highlights.\n\nPROS:\n\n• Catchy soundtrack that inspires emotion and really highlights the particular scene.\n• Graphics look good over a decade later. The cel-shaded style is timeless.\n• Meaningful decisions which affect your relationship with other characters (affection system).\n• Deceptively complex story that is told well and has some nice surprises.\n• Characters are genuine and likeable.\n• Variety of outfits which aren't expensive DLC.\n• Creative and diverse dungeons with fun puzzles.\n• Control and play as any character in your party. Local co-op for up to 4 players.\n• Worth playing for several NG+ for fun upgrades, optional content, and 100% completion.\n• Multiple character endings and opportunities to explore their personalities in-depth.\n• Combat is essentially hack and slash on a fixed plane; breaks away from turn-based combat.\n• Earn "grade" depending on your performance in battle. Grade is mainly used for the NG + shop.\n• Three difficulty settings to choose from.\n• English or Japanese voices.\n\nCONS:\n\n• Old school sound effects can be annoying, like when navigating through the menu.\n• A few grammatical errors such as missing spaces or minor misspellings. At one point the text states that one character is talking, but it is actually another one. In addition, the text does not match what the voice is saying at all during this quote.\n• World/field map camera behaves poorly so just look at the mini map. A non-issue later in the game.\n\nI highly recommend this, especially as your first Tales game. Symphonia really shows what the series does well in terms of story, characters, and additional content. This is a favourite of many for a reason and deserves more attention on Steam. I hope you give this classic a try!","May 24","true","199.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Definitely in my top *mumblemumble* of all time games.\n\nFor those who played it on GC, you need no explanation. I think the port is great. Previous reviews indicate there were snafus when it first came out, but it seems golden now. The only bug I've encountered is how Sheena got stuck in muddy clothes (from her fall through the mines the first time you meet her) and they have never updated back to "normal".\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the game: it's a JRPG, and a rather amazing one at that. The story is immense and compelling, and the gameplay is just fun. There are so many elements to it, but none feel clunky or tacked on. The combat is real time (not turn-based) and you can choose your party and which character to control. Unlocking skills is one of the funner aspects of the game, along with figuring out synergies and combos, etc. It would take too long to explain everything but basically the combat is solid and hardly gets stale as you can just swap to another character for a while if you get bored of Lloyd (blasphemy!).\n\nThe game also has immense replay value as you get to buy perks for your next go around, which just makes it all the more awesome. It really makes you want to get that 100% complete every time, but not in a grindy forced way like a lot of JRPG.\n\nIf there is anything to be called a "con" it's that I would love to see this game with updated graphics on the levels of recent FF games. It's already a beautiful game but I would pay solid money to have it more "realistic" (and I'm not usually picky about that sort of thing, I just think this game would be absolutely gorgeous if it were updated).\n\nAnyway, for $20 I highly recommend it.","May 25","true","60.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(The DRM is still there but it's no longer interfering with gameplay in any discernable way; I sent an e-mail to them requesting for help about 10 minutes before they released they patch and received a response earlier this morning).\n\ntl;dr: Symphonia's port was a broken messed when released on February 1st, but any issue that the game was having was fixed within a day for me.\n\nUnfortunately, the eyes still look low-res like they did in the PS3 version and it's really weird during close-up shots because the rest of the characters look so much sharper.\n\nSymphonia's age is starting to show though.  When the game was released in 2004, the 3D battling system was groundbreaking.  But they've perfected it in newer games and the absence of certain features can make going back to this extremely weird.\n\nThe good news is that there is more content in this version than the original GCN version: 5/9's of the cast's mystic artes were dropped on the original but are present here, there's some new dialogue in places, some new titles and costumes, and such.\n\nThe story and the characters hold up well, and the first act of the game tease of cliche-storms and foreshadowing still makes me wonder how I missed it all as a kid.\n\nThe PC port has been updated to work with a standard keyboard and...I'm surprised to say it doesn't feel that weird. I thought I would be reeling a lot more from the control change but it's been honestly super easy to control and do what I want within the game engine so far (through Triet).\n\nMy only issue with the game is that there is no native support for a PS3 controller, but that's more of an issue with Windows than Tales.","February 3","true","74.5"," 27 of 56 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","27","56","0","0"

The analog feels difficult to aim at times, but this accurately reflects how it was originally as well.\n\nThere aren't really graphic settings to speak of besides resolution.

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Normally, I would start a review with my conclusive thoughts in a less blunt manner. However, I'm sure people won't bother read further if I don't mention the port.\n\nIt's another one of many Tales of Phon(ing)-in-a-game:\n30 FPS lock from the PS3 version.\nInternal resolution of 720p.\nVMProtect software DRM, an anti-piracy software. I've read how it's both harmful to the PC as well as how it's not a big deal except for modders.\nI don't think PC gamers are entitled for expecting more, but here's the thing: The game is playable. (I did have one or two issues around the 40 hour mark, missing voice-acting and one unexplained crash.)\n\nAll of this is to say I'm more focused on the merits and the problems about the game than its technical details. (They are problems, but none I would think as damning).\n\nIf those problems are issues to you, then you should voice your opinion with your wallet.\n\nEDIT: I revised my review to focus more on the game's issues. I moved the block of text of nitpicks to the comments' section.\n\n"Enough Talk! Have at You!"\nToS's core gameplay focuses around its active-time battle-system which can be played with 1 - 4 players. (Or 0 if you want to play it like a traditional JRPG similar to FF13.)\n\nThis game doesn't require you to have friends (local) to enjoy it as the AI is "bearable" with minor baby-sitting. Nor does every character seem tailored for players. However, the novelty of playing a cooperative JRPG of 45 to 50 hours is what makes the feature stand out.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's enjoyable, though too simple when you look for depth.\n\nIn spite of the variety of 256 enemies--with a lot of color-palatte swaps--and nine heroes, it's becomes obvious how there are only three enemy types for the whole game: Sorcerers/casters, melee fighters and rangers. (No hero acts like the last type.) Bosses also all fall within these categories, which makes them feel easier than cheaper enemies like mimics.\n\nSimple enemy behaviors are not what makes the combat too simple. It's actually the battle-system itself.\n\nEvery engagement becomes a giant mosh-pit. You cannot move freely in battle--you can move forward and back, and change the camera if there is more than one enemy. The 2D movement results in every engagement converging to the center, which makes the tactics feel pointless. A simple fix would be to use the shoulder buttons to strafe around enemies.\n\nThe system also presents the problem when you get backed into a corner by the camera. You have no control over it, which means enemies can obscure your character if there is only one enemy on screen.\n\nAll these issues do not take away from the visceral combat--if you stick with the melee fighters. Their move-sets are the best because they have the most fluid combat and they have the best combo potential.\n\nIt's not a surprise to me now that when my stepbrother and I played this game we always stuck with Lloyd, Kratos, Sheena and Zelos. (Colette, Presea and Regal all feel too clunky.)\n\nIf you never played a Tales of game before (or haven't in a long time), I wouldn't expect this battle-system to be exceptionally innovative. It's competent in comparison to the game's lacking mechanics.\n\nMeh, Some Features.\nOne might say I should temper my expectations of playing a game from over a decade ago, but it's surprising how many of these extra features are undeveloped or shallow.\n\nThe exploration of ToS is good for about the first half the game (20 - 25 hrs) without the Reyiards. You have to manuever around enemies, find monuments to make the travel-time smaller, and you have to explore the continents with some non-linear play.\n\n(The funny thing is that the game itself is very fast-paced and linear if you pay attention to names.)\n\nOnce you get the Reyiards, which comes shortly after obtaining the boat, there is less exploration involved and more so of moving from A to B with no obstacles. It honestly feels like these machines were meant to be saved for the end-game to quickly tie-up any side-quests.\n\nThe exploration is at least passable, which is what I cannot really say for the menus/systems in the game.\n\nThe Gald system is so easy to obtain money that you can avoid grinding in the game with some exploration to just upgrade your characters, restock your items, and even then waste 200K+ on Luin with a lot left over. (The only reason I gave it away is because I didn't have any other use for the money.)\n\nI am honestly okay with this system because I never once felt like I had to grind, but I would like more uses of my money. What I avoid buying where the EX Gems and the Cooking materials because you more often find them as you play or you'll forget about them because they add little to the game.\n\nThe Cooking system becomes worthless when you can buy Gels for dirt-cheap. The meals don't provide really any bonuses to the game. (They restore health and magic--like gel.) The recipies aren't obtained through experimentation but of finding the right ingredients for your limited recipies.\n\nEX Skills are a little more useful as they provide perks that can make your party more specialized. But, again, you'll find more than enough through exploration than you would using your Grade Points. (Something you should save up for NG+ if you want to go for Mania mode.)\n\nI don't hate these sytems, nor are they broken; they feel tacked on for extending the game. Much like the game itself.\n\nRemind Me, Again, Why Don't You?\nI'm not going to mention spoilers; instead, I'm going to criticize ToS' storytelling faults and positives.\n\nWhat stood out to me about ToS's archetype cast is how most (with the exception of two characters) feel necessary for the plot. Almost every character could be seen as the protagonist. This is usually a problem for other series, but here it goes a long way to establishing the cliche moral "You can't save the world alone."\n\nIt's also no surprise that the two characters (Presea and Regal) whom I question why they are in the game are also a part of my problem with this game's mature themes. They feel out of place and are often poorly handled.\n\nThe game constantly talks about sacrifices, deaths, conspiracies, and other darker subject matters without committing to some message. These issues often feel shallow or underdeveloped.\n\nFor example, if the message was one of "You cannot always save everyone", then why does the game have situations where you do save everyone? It's not like Valkyria Chronicles where they emphasized the actions of the characters to commit to a message.\n\nIt's ironic how a cynic like myself praises the game's lighter/egalitarian themes of friendship, equality, the problems with overcoming discrimination and the problem with ideals. There are some well-thoughout stuff written here.\n\nBy far the biggest problem of the narrative is how often it reguritates itself.\n\nFar too often in both cutscenes and the "skits" (voiceless talks for English), characters have to repeat information that was either said a few mins ago. Or it was established way back hours ago. Or at the very beginning of the game.\n\nIt becomes a problem because there are some exchanges that are worthwhile to listen to, but you have to sit-through a lot of repetition to find them.\n\nThen add-on the confusion of the organizations' names, double-crossings, and the power-play game around you. In the end,  I don't find myself understanding a grand conspiracy but finding a mess of a story.\n\nThe game also suffers from some serious padding. If nostalgia won't let you leave, the game sure will pad itself out to keep you playing for 45 - 50 hours.\n\nYou Don't Like it, Do You?\nI might come across as not liking the game, but I honestly still love it; it's hard to look past its faults. Still, you should definitely play it. Maybe elsewhere if the port isn't for you.","February 4","true","47.3"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","14","30","2","1"

While some people might not compare it to today's art and animation, this game will blow almost any modern game out of the water for story content. When compared to other modern games, it feels like the creators focused on the story first rather than last. Not to say the game has bad art or system controls, quite the opposite really. From the fight system to the world map the game comfortable and the controls for moving, fighting, and navigating the menus is too simple not to grasp. The characters don't look as blocky as some might expect, and capture the actual character's design beautifully. The in menu art is simply amazing, not much else to be said about it.\n\nThe game has great art, great story, and great form, and will make an excellent addition to any story lover's library. Any person who loves story will love this game, as this isn't some game you'll beat in a day of playing. Even knowing where everything was and ignoring the optional content, it took me nearly 38 hours to beat the game. Going through the game looking for all that extra stuff, completing all the things you can, this game can extend well over 150 hours.\n\nWhile true that the New PC version has a few issues, they are easily fixed. For those who find it crashing on start up, simply run the game as the administrator and you're home free!\n\nThis is a treasure, and it brings me great joy to see it brought back.","February 2","true","2.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

So far I can't see a single thing changed (which, apparently, is a bad thing for some folks, but the rest of us are just happy to get a game we loved back in highschool).\n\nIf you have not played ToS before, it's a very vibrantly-colored, exciting game with an emotionally-charged story. The dialogue is hammy, but it's endearing and, honestly, if it wasn't hammy the whole game might take itself too seriously.\n\nThe port isn't nearly as bad as folks are making it out to be. There were some hiccups in the beginning with customize/save screen taking a bit of time to come up, but that has been patched out. Graphics options being "non-existent" is a bit confusing to me, as it's a port of a 12-13 year old game: what were you looking for, exactly? You can choose between fullscreen or windowed, and it supports up to 1920x1080.\n\nController support is excellent. It's almost like this game was made with an Xbox controller in mind.\n\nI have had exactly zero crashes and the slow-loading menu issue was patched out by the second time I started it up.

Yes, some of it are downright atrocious in this day and age. However, if you do not consider yourself as part of the "PC MASTER RACE", then know that most of the technical problems were fixed and some of the other problems are basically nitpickings from the so-called "PC MASTER RACE".\n\nSo if we looked beyond the technical problems, how does the game fare? Well, it's a 2004 game. If you've already played "Tales Of Zestiria", then this game is the watered down version. Unless you're wearing nostalgia glasses, you'll notice that the gameplay doesn't age well. Newer generations of gamers who were too young to play this back when it got released will probably get bored with how the game played within a few hours.\n\nStory is also not something to write home either. Sure, back when I played this all those years ago, the story feels amazing and rewarding but that's probably my 12 year old mentality speaking. It's not as good as I remembered it. It's cliche and predictable. Perfect for early teens but not for fully grown adults.\n\nCharacters are your standard JRPG stereotypes. A hot headed MC, a ditzy female MC, a shota, a loli, some older male who is obviously smarter than the MC, etc. If there are people calling these characters "deep" or "fleshed-out", they are either b*llsh*tting you or have a serious case of nostalgia fever.

I'm not sure if it is fair to say that this game totally lacks controller support or if it is just locked behind a broken menu option that crashes the game any time you try to access it. The same can also be said for custom resolutions, frame rate limits, and voice acting options. After about a dozen crashes I have decided it would be best to warn whoever I can and request my steam refund early. The original game was a hugely enjoyable romp and I was excited to see it be brought back, but it is hard to imagine what the developer (engineers? intern?) was doing the last few months pending release because it could not have amounted to more than 45 minutes of actual work. Go find a ROM and dolphin emulator for an actual playable experience. This is just the absolute laziest cash-in that could have been produced.","February 1","false","0.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Pasti sangat sedikit, & salah satu dari sedikit game itu adalah Tales of Symphonia. Game original yang dibuat untuk Nintendo GameCube (2003), tak lama kemudian dihadirkan untuk Sony PS2 (2004), yang beberapa tahun kemudian dirilis versi HD untuk PS3 (2013). Masih belum selesai, PC Windows pun mendapatkan port pada tahun 2016 ini lewat Steam.\n\nGrafis/Port (3/10)\nCuma satu kata untuk kualitas port ToS, "kacau".\nMapping button yang asal ambil dari PS, masalah save windows 7 yang lama, lock 720p, lock 30fps, crash, dll. Cukup memberi respon negatif untuk ToS. Untungnya masih ada  GeDoSaTo & Kalaiden yang memperbaikinya dengan Fix hingga ToS dapat dimainkan dengan lancar.\n\nCerita (10/10)\nTak ada yang perlu diragukan soal cerita ToS. Meski dimulai dari cerita yang cukup klise, ToS berkembang begitu kompleks. penuh intrik & plot twist & menyedihkan namun tetap menyuguhkan kelucuan & terkadang begitu konyol. Konsep cerita fantasi pada game terkadang membuat kita kesulitan memahami ceritanya namun ToS menjelaskannya pelan2 hingga setidaknya kita mengerti apa yang sedang terjadi.\n\nGameplay (9/10)\nSistem pertarungan & eksplorasi dunia ToS sangat klasik namun keunggulan utama ToS ada pada saat dalam dungeon. Berbeda dengan game2 baru yang cuma meminta kita berjalan maju & mengalahkan monster untuk menyelesaikan dungeon, dalam setiap dungeon ToS hampir selalu ada puzzle yang memaksa kita untuk berpikir bagaimana membuka pintu, jalan atau mengakses tempat tertentu. Sorcerer ring selalu berubah fungsi sesuai puzzle dalam dungeon. Cukup membuat kita untuk membuka google atau walkthrough.\n\n","February 19","true","90.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","2"

I waited to get it, though, after seeing the flood of feedback on poor framerates and other issues, but when I finally caved in to my desire to relive my memories, I was thrilled to see that the game ran smoothly AND had the option for Japanese voice-overs, something that was sorely absent from the GC version.\n\nHowever, I've barely made any progress at all, due to opting to start off on Hard Mode, and thus needed to grind a bit to both gain much needed strength and to regain my skills with Lloyd. That said, I've just managed to get Kratos in my party, and now have the Sorcerer's Ring... but I've discovered one MAJOR FLAW that will make this game almost unplayable for me once I make further progress...\n\nWHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS MY FREE-RUN?!? THAT IS A CRUCIAL PART OF THE BATTLES!!\n\nSeriously! Without the free-run (I discovered the lack of it while fighting the Golems during the puzzle to get the Ring), there is only one way to fight any large monster or boss... running face-first into them - which, as we all know, is a Total Wipe waiting to happen at worst, and suicidally recovery-item-dependent at best. No free-run means having to COMPLETELY change how I play!!\n\nThat said, I'm still gonna play the game, but this NEEDS TO BE FIXED!! And the fix is ♥♥♥♥in' simple! Change the default input on the gamepad (I use a usb-wired 360 controller) to the D-pad and put the free-run on the left bumper!\n\nDespite this painfully suicidal issue, I still love it, and that love will never be diminished... or extinguished. And I would still recommend it, as it's one of the three games I'd ever consider doing a 100% Completion run of... the others being its sequel, Dawn of the New World, and Skies of Arcadia: Legends (which needs to be ported properly to Steam as well).","April 10","true","7.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/recommended/372360/","goldenagegmr","GAGMR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goldenagegmr/","425 products in account","Tales of Symphona was one of the best JRPG's of the 4th generation of game consoles but is this port as good as it's Gamecube counterpart?\n\nAs of right now no it isn't, but it may still be worth your time.\n\nPROS\n-Active Combat Battle System\n-Fun & Unique Characters\n-Vast open world to explore\n-Very good story & dialog\n-Multiple Endings\n-80+ hours of content\n\nCONS\n-30FPS Lock\n-Delay in menus for Win7 Machines\n-Intro Song is baaaad (mod available)\n-Poor Texture Quality\n-DRM is hidden in the game (WHY!?)\n\nSTORY\n\nI'll keep it brief & spoiler free.  You play as Lloyd, a young warrior who's bad at school.  One day, you & your friends are in school as usual when a bright flash of light happens outside!  It's the signal that the chosen one, Collette, is ready to partake in her trials.  And then you set out on your adventure to bring Collette to the seals around the globe & awaken her as the Chosen One!  Eventually you learn being the chosen isn't what it seems & has a dark twist of fate.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is simple but also involves some strategy.  You move around the overworld as you would in any other JRPG while random encounters spawn in the world around you.  You can try to avoid them or run into one to start a battle.  Battles are fought on 2.5D plains where you control the main character (or later on the character of your choosing) & combine joystick movements with button combinations to do combos as well as blocking attacks.  You can also press the menu button & cast specific spells or use items.  Combining certain techniques & spells will unleash a super move that deals extra damage & usually has some sort of short cutscene attatched.  The real strategy comes from figuring out all the comboes & super techs & using them accordingly.  There are also block puzzles scattered throughout the dungeons that are usually required to progress.  Of course, there are also recovery items that restore health & magic points as well as equipment upgrades & all the stuff you would normally find in any RPG.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are pretty poor, but still look relatively nice considering the games age.  Obviously, due to the cell shaded art style.  Still, the textures are pretty poor all things considered.  This isn't an HD port, it's just a port.  Even so, you'd think they could have made it look a little nicer.  Everything is really pixelated.\n\nThe game is also locked to 720p resolution.  You can change the settings to go higher but it just upscales 720p to whatever you put it at.  The game honestly looks better at the default resolution because of this.  There's also a lack of graphics customization outside of the resolution which isn't very good either.\n\nTECHNICAL ISSUES\n\nThe game runs at a locked 30FPS which is also a pretty big deal if you've played it running at 60 on the gamecube or other versions.  The active combat system feels like it was designed specifically for 60fps so you may have problems playing the game on higher difficulties.\n\nIf you're running on a Win7 machine you will probably experience some menu lag when trying to save or change the config settings.  A good 20-30 seconds of delay.  The devs have stated they are working on a fix for this issue.  Hopefully it will be settled soon.\n\nAUDIO\n\nThe audio is actually one of the things that have been improved.  All the soundtracks & dialog are not compressed like the gamecube counterpart.  I haven't played the game on PS2/PS3 so I can't really compare that one.  It all sounds pretty good overall.  Excluding the J-Pop intro song, which just ruined the overall experience for me in the beginning.  Luckily someone released a mod that fixes it & replaces the music with the one from the gamecube.\n\nThe dialog is still as good as I remember it.  Being slightly cheesy & heartwarming while at times having that serious undertone for the moments that require it.  Voice acting in general is done very well.  I recommend playing this game with English voice overs just because the protagonist's voice actor is the same person who voices Robin from Teen Titans which was one of my favorite cartoons at the time this game came out.  All of the western voice actors sound great, imo.\n\nAfter looking into the game more & trying to use game capture software to record some play sessions I was having some issues & I went to find out why on the good old interwebs.  This game has some heavy DRM hidden inside of it.  UNACCEPTABLE!  This game is over a decade old & does not need any DRM hidden in it!\n\nOVERALL\n\nI was really disappointed at first with the intro song debacle & the fact that I run a Win7 machine & the game will constantly have delays on Win7 while loading certain menu screens.  The devs have stated they are working to fix this issue, though.  The game itself remains intact, albeit at 30fps which is another large issue.  The gamecube version ran at a smooth 60fps so this feels like a downgrade & you can really feel the difference during combat & cutscenes. I can only recommend the game to people who have yet to actually play Tales of Symphona & who want to try it or for those who really just want to own the game again on PC.  As of right now, you should just wait for a patch & hope some of the issues are fixed especially if you're running on Win7.","February 1","false","1.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Instead we know what the specs are (or rather are not) and that's colouring people's perspectives.  Yes it's locked at 30fps instead of 60 (which, I'm not endorsing and is a shame) and some people have had resolution issues (I personally have not but I know how frustrating it is when you can't adjust this setting).\n\nBut, specs aside, the game plays fine on my laptop and it's really fun.  I never played the original version so I can't compare but I do have Tales of Zestiria on Steam and Symphonia is a much more enjoyable experience.  The combat is quick paced and fun, the story is cheesy (a good thing when playing Tales games, imo), music is good and graphically the game looks great.  I've only played for 3 hours, but no bugs or crashes yet so that's a plus too.  The only downside about that actual game for me is the voice acting - the person who voices Lloyd also did Max from Dark Cloud 2 and it's a jarring enough disconnect for me that I actually turned them off (but that's just a personal issue, the voice acting itself is okay).\n\nBottom line, if you care about the specs then be aware that this is locked at 30fps.  If that doesn't matter to you then the game itself is pretty solid port of a great game.","February 3","true","4.3"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

Characters are great. The OST is godlike.\nIt's one of the best, if not THE best Tales of. And I know what I'm talking about.\nAnother thing you need to know : as I said earlier, it's an old game.

C'mon.\nYou either bought it out of nostalgia, or you got it free as a part of the Tales of Zestiria bonus.\nYou're that diehard that you NEED 60fps ?

Instead it takes a more classic method like those found in older Final Fantasy games... windows, cursor & other basic colour selections.\nThe biggest downside of the way it's been ported is that resolution selection is built into the game which isn't ideal but isn't completely horrible either.\nControls are the kind I would expect from any console game with mouse controls not really being needed; wasd to move & camera control being predefined. (If there is custom camera angle controls I have not found them yet.)\nHopefully well supported by Bandai the first patch is already queued by my Steam client. However there is no patch notes as of yet. However... Bandai would have to try to cause problems to beat poor performances from studios like Koei or Warner Brothers.\nStory wise I expect a standard "Tales Of" game with my last Tales game being Tales Of Phantasia & watching Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World being played through by a family member. The Phantasia game was  a very positive experience for me & except for the fact it's console only (which no longer interest me) Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World seemed interesting & was much enjoyed by the player.\nOh... & since I've done a bit of the good & a bit of the bad in this review... I have to say the ugly is the number of trolls that have come out with this release.\nGame is worth a look however I'll note I got it for free by purchasing Tales of Zestiria early.","February 2","true","0.4"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

For those who worry about 60fps difference, you must realise that hte original game released on ps2 was in 30fps as well and played jsut fine, only the Gamecube version was boosted to 60fps and showed no difference in play at all.  So now that we have taken care of that lets get to the real review.\n\nThe game on release was a bit choppy, but I have not expereinced the same crashes others have claimed, it did have lag and a large time to reopen after being minimised but if you dont mind playing in a slightly smaller windowed version that problem is completely aleviated.  Overall I do recomend having a controler for play as it is ratehr difficult to properly manage Tech usage in quick time while using the keyboard controls.  Overall though this game is just as fun as I remembered and has a great story and a decent range of diffculty that will keep you working at it till the very end.","February 2","true","10.6"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

You can set strategies for AI controlled party members but they can act pretty stupidly at times and this can be problematic around bosses or particularly hard enemies. Still I realize most of the problems are simply due to the age of the game rather than downright bad design, I'm simply playing something from 13 years ago and games have evolved alot since then.\n\nIf you can look past its shortcomings and don't mind its age Tales of Symphonia is a really great game that any JRPG fan'd at least once, it also serves as what is probably the strongets entry in the Tales series as far as story and characters go.","February 18","true","49.3"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

With that in mind, you can easily tell how hyped I was when I heard about this coming on PC and for 20€ no less!\n\nThe hype is hype, though.  While the game functions well enough (haven't gotten through the first dungeon yet, though) in that it starts, runs and functions well enough, I can see why people are callign this a disastrous port.  There are significant instabilities that CAN be avoided, if you know what they are.\nFor instance, the game crashes for me when I enter the configuration menu from the start menu (logical first step with any new game) and the loading times for save menus is abhorent *by modern standards.*  The config menu does work while in the actual game, it just takes nearly a minute to get in.\nI can accept that this game is a port of a previous gen port, especially since I've never owned any other console than what Nintendo's produced.  I like the additional motion in the skits, I look forward to the added Anime cutscenes (which I know are in the PS3 version), I love that the redone japanese intro is in the game and I especially like the option of playing the game with japanese voice work.  That last one breathes new life into a game I've already played through multiple times with 40-80h on each playthrough (damn metal spheres...).  Best of all, I can play this game with an XB controller.\n\nTo address what people are really complaining about with this port are the graphics, the instability and the DRM.\nI've been a gamer for over two decades, well into my prime for 16.  Graphics are something I don't particularly care about.  As long as it looks good, I like it.  That's why I grind through multiple classic games and occasionally revisit my Nintendo library.  Then again, 1080p is better than 720p, but that's more like a bonus to me than anything.\nThe instability is a big minus, especially since my antivirus detects each .tmp file the game creates when I try to change the settings before going into the campaign, promptly leading to an irresponsiveness crash.\nThe DRM....  When will devs learn that DRM doesn't do jack squat?\n\nSo to sum up my feelings about this port....  It has problems.  Boy, does it have problems, but it works.  And as long as it works, I'm willing to bend around them.  And since it works to my satisfaction, I give it a thumbs up.  A 51/49 thumbs up, but still.\n\nTl;dr I recommend this game for those who want a classic JRPG experience and are willing to forgive technical issues, especially those who want to ride on GC nostalgia.  If you're a graphics junkie who wants something modern and without technical issues, you might want to think twice before buying this.  And even then you better have a controller, since this thing is NOT meant for keyboard+mouse.  PS3 port owners shouldn't bother.\n\n\n===POST UPDATE===\nLot of instability fixed, menus work well; still getting annoying F-secure popups about the .tmp files, though.","February 3","true","8.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Recommend you play the PS3 port or even the PS2 version! This is a terrible port and could be on its way to compete with Batman: Arkham Knight for the title of worst port! I'm honestly shocked given how amazing Tales of Zestiria was! What I experienced on PS2: Great story, a variety of characters with their place and their growth as individuals through the story. Great fighting mechanics and decent graphics....This was supposed to be one of the many old games which are the origins for all the great stories we see in current day movies and games. Not everybody has seen or experienced this masterpiece as it was initially only on consoles. With this Steam release I was hoping other gamers could see it for themselves! What do they and I get? Broken text and language, and I'm not usually a person who places importance on graphics but this port has actually downgraded the graphics to GameCube levels? Not even to the level I saw on PS2! Crashes...oh yes Plenty! I bought this game to experience one of my favorite games on PC which is my preferred platform. Have a new higher video quality experience......This has been terrible to say the least. I can only hope that Bandai Namco releases a patch to correct this mess!

Access to different skills though "s" and "t" isn't explained that well so it's possible for a character to be let's say "t" and you never switch over to "s" and in doing so never get the opportunity to play a character with many different skills.\n\nThere's also "ex gems", equipping these to a character allow you to move from "s" to "t" type (or vise versa).\n\nEx gems also provide a character with skills and with the allowance of up to 4 of these gem means that different gems equipped together can provide you with special ex skills.\n\nWhat sucks about this is some characters have powerful compound ex skills while others get very weak compound ex skills.\n\nIt's not the end of the world though.\n\nAlso, the affection that your party members have towards you is very cryptic.  It shouldn't be seeing as how a stronger relationship with character "a" will yield a different story then had you had a stronger relation with character "b".  It's not major differences, but it shouldn't be so cryptic.\n\nIf you keep reading reviews, watch a let's play.  You'll either take to the characters and combat or not.\n\nFor the many games I've played and for playing this game when I rented it from a Blockbuster when I was younger...  Still manages to hold up pretty well.\n\n/edit\n\nI forgot to include this.  There's also hidden attacks.  So.  Another way to fully enjoy this game is that there's a couple moves (not many) that change when your character is equipped with an elemental gem...  some weapons have an element associated with them and there's also a character that can temporarily add an element (fire, water, etc) to your character and your attacks hit the enemy infused with the power of that element.\n\nFor example, if your character is associated with "fire", you'll do extra damage to enemies weak to fire.\n\nBeing associated/equipped with "fire" can turn ...  let's just use "demon fang" for example into "fire demon fang" (it doesn't).\n\nThere are moves that change due to different elements, but it's kind of random thing in this game.  It's worth mentioning because I wanted to see more of it and I would bet more people would like more of these moves.\n\nBUT, because it's so cryptic...  many people do not know these moves even exist.","February 24","true","67.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

These games range from the Resident Evil Remake and Resident Evil 4, Star Wars Rouge Squadron II and Eternal Darkness just to name a few. While the system wasn't really the place for J-RPGs it arguably got one of if not one of the most memorable games of the past decade and longtime fans still consider it to be one of the best games on the Gamecube next to Metroid Prime and the aforementioned Resident Evil 4. This game I'm talking about is Tales of Symphonia which made some J-RPG fans who were stuck with all the Final Fantasy games turn their heads in some way. Tales of Symphonia was known for it's amazing characters and story, great battle system and it's responsible for creating a loyal fanbase that helped spawn a sequel as well as a Japan only animation. It was later ported onto the PS2 and PS3 in which they added some new content put played rather horribly and that can also be said for it's PC port which is now available for download on Steam.\n\nBefore I get into how terrible and unoptimized the PC port of Tales of Symphonia is I should explain just the basics of what the game is and how it is played. The game follows the protagonist Lloyd Irving who journeys with his friend Colette Brunel who is the chosen who must save the world from both the loss of mana and also a group called Desians which are causing people to suffer. Throughout the game you get to witness several character moments and backstories which are really great and gives each of the game's characters plenty of depth. Lloyd Irving the game's main protagonist is surprisingly likeable, he believes in a world where everybody lives their lives equally. Colette is a humorous klutz who trips over in some unexpected events, but something good comes out of it while also taking a few conversions out the window when her stupidity is in play. Presea is an emotionless girl who has lost her time being controlled by the exsphere but once she regained her emotions her characteristics involving her voice and likeness in paw pads make her very enjoyable. The best out of the Symphonia cast is Kratos a wondering swordsman with secrets that can't be spoiled here, he fells guilt over the things he felt so weak to accomplish and he's every bit as heroic as Lloyd and also believing in his ideals. He's a calm and collected character and his english voice by Cam Clarke is well delivered. Like in these Tales games you can expect to have several plot twists that can surprise first time players and despite the long story development time the storyline in Tales of Symphonia is really enjoyable and it will feature moments that will leave players laughing or crying in tears. The series stable is the skit system in which many of the characters chat over the currant events that will unfold or just plain idle chats which can be hilarious while other times just emotional that you often feel sorry for their situations at times. Each of the characters are voiced in both English and Japanese allowing you hear the original tracks from the Japanese version.\n\nTales of Symphonia is an Action RPG which was very different from the turn based RPGs that were out at the time. The game is split between an overworld where you enter towns to rest, get better equipment and get clues to your next objective. The overworld and each of the dungeons has several monsters to fight which require you to touch them to start each fight making you decide how you want to handle your battles. There are puzzles to solve as well as a challenging boss encounter that appears at the end. As long as you do spend actual time grinding up experience points to make your party members stronger and upgrading their equipment you shouldn't find the game hard on the Normal Difficulty setting.\n\nTales of Symphonia's battles take place in real time rather then turn based in which four of your party members are taken into battle with each of them having their own abilities called Artes in which you chain together to create highly damaging combos. While you can play alone you can add extra controllers (if your PC has extra USB slots) to have other players join in the battles locally. Enemies have a strength and weakness mechanic where enemies are weak against certain elemental attacks which can make battles a lot easier once you learn their weaknesses and how the enemies behave in battle. Later on in the game you'll access to the Unison Attack which allows four of the characters to combine all their attacks to create a powerful attack if the right attacks are met and also like in the PlayStation versions you can also pull off a Mystic Arte which deals major damage but require conditions in order to pull them off. The battle controls is a little hard to go back to if you have played the more recent Tales of Zestiria and it's more note worthy if you are playing with an Xbox 360 controller. Regardless Symphonia's battles are merely a product of it's time and it pretty much shows how much the game has aged which the rest of it I will come back to.\n\nThe gameplay does add some character customization, there are unlockable titles and costumes which are unlocked through completing sidequests. Sidequests require you to talk to various NPCs which have to be done at the right time in the story or some will become unavailable if you progressed to far. You can cook up meals to restore your characters HP, TP and status effects which can be learned from Wonder Chefs found in towns aside from using recovery items. There is also a Ex-Skill system where you can equip Ex-Gems gives characters different abilities and the correct combinations will give characters Ex-Skills like improved guarding, higher chances of critical hits, chances of resurrection and so on. Like in other Tales games there is plenty of customization which allows you to experiment to your playstyle and this game really does reward the player in that regard.\n\nNow that I have talked about the gameplay of Tales of Symphonia it's time to talk about what is wrong with the PC port of the game. Now to be fair for a 13 year old game that originally came out on the Gamecube it does look great but the issue is that the game's graphics and overall design is based entirely on the PlayStation releases of the game. I've noticed that the PC version of the game is not running at a high definition resolution and I have seen on the internet that the graphics are at 720p resolutions. It means that you'll see things like dull and pixilated textures on the environments, stiff animations and also plenty of character clipping. What's also bad about the graphics in this port is that the frame rate is locked to 30 and there is some mild stuttering and some reported that they can run the game at best 40 fps. Other problems with the game come from the incomplete and broken translations, various typos, PS3 and XBox 360 button icons being used, random crashes, only six save slots, saving and loading taking 30 seconds to occur when played in Windows 7 and this DRM program called VMProtect which creates a new ".exe" file every time the game boots up.\n\nTo see my full review of Tales of Symphonia for the PC then use this link. http://www.gamespot.com/tales-of-symphonia/user-reviews/2200-12688171/","April 4","true","62.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This is one of the better games in the Tales series, as well one of the most iconic JRPGs of its generation, and it still holds up to this day.\nIf you're into the genres, by all means this is the game for you. If you haven't tried any JRPGs before then this is a very good starting point. If you straight up hate JRPGs then I guess avoid this one: the story is very much fond of the genre's cliches, but the Tales of battle system made one of its biggest improvements in this titles, so action and fighting games fans might just feel right at home with its combo system (which admittedly requires you to invest some time and leveling up in order to get to the good parts of it).\n\nI know many people who played this back in the day and are sitting this port out due to the technical issues. To them I say that now it's fine to step in and buy the game.\n\nTo those who have never played this before, I can only suggest to play it once on their own. And then play it over and over again  (perhaps following guides from the second time around), because there are many things to do here, even missables and all, and I always found this to be one of the most replayable games out there despite its length.","February 17","true","53.6"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Game opens perfectly every time, no audio issues though with headphones you can tell the audio was recorded in 2003/2004, no save or menu delay, to tearing, no vsync issues (though I hate that it seems to be forced), no crashing at all. The alt-tabing isn't great but that seems to be the case for anything not running borderless windowed mode which I hope they include in a patch otherwise I'll have to find a way to force it. The FPS for me hits 30 consistantly.\nThe lack of options kind of sucks but it looks a bit better than the PS3 version and feels a lot smother. (compated both on the same monitor) The battle system is identical to the PS3 and again feels smoother. Its not 60fps smooth but its definitly playable and the lower FPS hasn't had a real impact on the feel of the battle system. If you've only played the gamecube there are none of the extra c-stick options for artes in battle. The anime cutscenes could be smoother but other than that technical wise its been a decent port for me not perfect but nowehre near the worst.\n\nI'm running a non-oc'd FX-8120, 16gb RAM, a gtx 970 and a basic 7200rpm HDD on my desktop. Audio is set at 24bit 192Khz.\n\nFor those that don't know, the PS3 version is based of the Japan only PS2 release not the Game Cube which is where the bulk of the extra content comes from as well as the slightly increased dificulty.\n\nStory wise still as great as it always was, got it for christmas when if first came out and have put in well over 1000 hours over the years. Most characters aren't static and grow and change throught the story and makes you actually care about the characters and what happens to them. The story sits between sterious and whimsical, having moments of both but neither becoming overbearing. Definitly one of my top two Tales games along with Vesperia.\n\n*note* hours played isn't too accurate, I mostly play in offline mode and Steam doesn't record offline hours\n*Edit* Running the newest Windows 10 public build and the latest Nvidia drivers","February 2","true","2.5"," 17 of 39 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","17","39","0","3"

I think a lot of people don't remember that the opening scene was in fact a little jumpy, and that remains in this port.  Even though the game is locked at 30fps, I don't personally notice anything during actual gameplay.\n\nFor the game itself, it's a great game, with a very unique battle system for an RPG.  It has an amazing arcing story, and I'm very much looking forward to going through the rest of the game again.

I have played the original version back in the GC era, the PS2 remake, and the PS3 rerelease, haveing recorded 26, 13, and 8 playthroughs of each game respectively.  I may not have experienced the bitter taste of the initial phases of this game that I've heard horror stories of.\n\nAnyways, here's my review.\n\nSome Pros:\n\nThe TSfix mod that I installed out of caution has made this game look very good. Certainly better looking than the PS3 version.\n\nIn my opinion, 30FPS isn't that much of a problem if it's stable which it is with TSfix. I bet you people who have monsterous PCs would want to say otherwise. I can't say the same. I use a 2010 pre-built PC with a low end graphics card. Stable 30FPS is all I can afford and I'm getting it with TSfix.\n\nDual Audio is a good feature this game has if you're very used to the English version of this game by now and would like to try something new. Zestiria was like this which I appreciated. The Japanese audio has an entirely different tone to it compared to the English audio.\n\nSome Cons:\n\nAudio voice clips might not play during some scenes. This is bothersome if it's a significant scene as it subtracts some of the emotional value.\n\nSome grammatical issues but there's not many at this point.\n\nSome bugs like you recieve a title but the message says you got a totally different title.\n\nMight just be me, but I can't use my mouse whatsoever.\n\nI love Symphonia. It was one of the few games I had as a youngster and I didn't have many to play. It kept me entertained for years with it's interesting story, fun characters, and fun combat system. The game is also very long so don't expect to beat it in 2 days. While the port has had its downs, it's certainly playable as it is now.\n","February 21","true","66.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I love every single party member and I always loved the art-style.\nAt first, the story and cast might seem cheesy and childlike, but the story is full of suprises and dark turns. All characters have depth to them which you will unfold during the story, and you will grow to care for every single one of them allong the way.\nThis game has several antagonists with also great designs. Some are not as strong depth wise as others but that will be because they play a lesser part.\nCombat is super fun, I like cooking and item tweaking in this game.\n\nThe world is big, there are tons of hidden events, the story is long, but interesting enough to not lose interest, I like the English VA, even if they added the Japanese ones. And it has good replay and collectors value due to  NEW GAME PLUS, where you use GRADE(something you get after battles) to buy EXP bonusses, the saving of your gathered cooking recipes and more!\n\nPLUS unlike the NEW Tales of games you can unlock tons of cool outfits through events in game (which are all lovely done and light-hearted between the dark aspects of the game) instead of having to BUY them.\n\nAll in all this is a very lovable RPG which only downside now is the fact that it is a port.

As stated before, I want to play this game, not because it just came out, but because I have easily spent (at least) 1000 hours on this game when I played it back on the gamecube. This game has great gameplay and a great story. There will be several memorable characters and moments, especially if you go out and try finding the secrets within the game. Overall this game is by far a MUST play and I recommend to anyone who wants a great experience.

When the options do work, it make no difference since the ingame res is locked at 720p. The options themselves don't seem to work sometimes and just crash the game.\n\n- ITwould have been great if this games port quality was as good as Zestiria's, but it's actually worse\n\n\nthis kind of sucks since Tales of Symphonia is my FAVORITE game of all time. It has a large world with a great story, memorable characters, and great gameplay (all of which seems very slow at the start but once u have the full cast and know the real plot the game begins to pick up real fast). I HIGHLY reccomend that if you can't stomach this port you try to play this game using the gamecube version and an emulator. It is worth the time and you get the ability to upscale the resolution and textures and it will likely look better than any port available. YOu are only really missing out on extra costume quests you get in the PS3 version. (also some parts of the PS3 version actually made the game harder as they fixxed an exloit that let you unlock all artes for both S and T arte trees and they made it so getting the kratos flanoir scene requires you to have a good relationship with him while in gamecube you always get an option to speak to him if you say no to everyone else).","February 4","true","28.9"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","6","17","0","1"

It's not a product anyone should be proud of releasing, but it still plays just fine for me.\n\nIf you're a fan, or think you might become one, there's nothing stopping you from having fun here.  The game runs just fine for me (for as far as I've gotten, at least), so this isn't broken on some technical level.  The resolution and frame rate should be better, because there is no good excuse for it to not be, but I won't condemn it on those grounds alone.  Given the choice of playing this or setting my old consoles, I'm content with this.  Dealing with setting up my old machines is a pain in the rear.  I'm using a PS4 controller with Inputmapper, so as long as I have that set up, I don't think it will feel any different than going through the work of setting my old consoles up.\n\nIf you consider yourself to be highly conscious of the game industry and its faults, I'd recommend waiting for a sale on this one.  This kind of sloppy laziness probably shouldn't be rewarded with a full price purchase.  I personally bit that bullet because I liked the first disk on the Gamecube and never got around to finishing it.  I also needed to see for myself how "bad" the game was, because the complaints seemed a bit... obsessive...  A broken, buggy and unplayable game is one thing, a game with bad story or gameplay mechanics is another, and then there is this game where I have seen neither (yet).","February 3","true","0.6"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

The only issue I can see is the white screen after tabbing out of the game, but it vanishes shortly so it's not a big deal.\n\nI have the game set to 1080p but I'm not entirely too sure if that's what it's actually displaying as texture-wise. Thing's don't look crisp enough for it to be HD, especially when compared to Chronicles which I played shortly on PS3.\n\nRegardless, it runs fine perfomance wise. I believe there if a 30 FPS cap but it was the same with Chronicles so I'm not noticing it too much.\n\nA lot of people have had issue with their Windows 7 machines, though. So be wary.

This game is an example that should be shown to anyone designing a three dimensional competative fighting game, though you don't need to be an e-sports enthusiast to appreciate and enjoy this fun and replayable action RPG. It's a shame that cutscenes happen before a number of challenging bosses, but if you fight all random encounters that you run into, you will likely be about the right level for the bosses, so good play will reward you with little to no grinding. What this rerelease is really missing is the ability to play alongside friends via internet, but alas, we are restricted to local multiplayer and singleplayer play. Recomended more for the gameplay than the plot or characters, but all aspects of Tales of Symphonia can be enjoyed.","February 1","true","0.3"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

The game IS also locked to 30FPS, seeing as it's a port of the PS3 version.\n\nI've honestly had 0 issues with the game so far. Set it to 1080p res, windowed in the settings, had no delay or freezing. Set it to borderless via launch options. Granted it is 720p upscaled to a 1080p window, but the point is it's not causing the game to freak out like some are saying. Works fine for me.\n\nI've had ZERO choppiness or anything while on the world map, in battles, transitioning between menus and saving. Everything has been buttery smooth for me while livestreaming at the same time. And yes this is from someone who regularly games at over 60FPS. Regardless, there will be a 60FPS fix soon enough just like there was for Zestiria so no need to be butthurt over it.\n\n\nFor free(for those that pre-ordered Zestiria) and $20 for others? It's really a drop in the bucket and worth it.\nThe game is as fun as I remember, I love it to death and I'll be sinking many hours into this baby.\nIt's by far my favorite 'Tales of' game and it's honestly well deserved in my personal opinion.  I hope others can enjoy it as much as many of us did in the past! I already ran into many people that never had the chance to play it previously and are now looking to get it. :) Definitely a great oppurtunity","February 2","true","7.0"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","7","21","0","0"

If you weren't in time to recieve a launch copy for Tales of Symphonia by preordering Tales of Zestiria, and you're a fan of JRPGs, then this game is a must buy.\n\nNow, some people may be asking: "What's your experience playing Tales of Symphonia?"\n\nThis copy (on Steam) is the third copy of the game that I own.  I fist played ToS for the Gamecube when it was first released.  My first playthrough lasted for 400+ hours and by the end of my 4th playthrough I was able to achieve a 100% finish (after, easily, over 1000 hours of gameplay).  Years later, and with my consoles collecting dust in my basement due to lack of use, I decided I wanted to play ToS again and picked up a rom for the game online.  I only played through the rom once since the hidden dungeon and New Game+ features weren't working.\n\nNow that this is being released for PC with proper controls I'm looking forward to another amazing playthrough and will be eagerly awaiting the release of the sequal, Dawn of the New World, as well.","February 1","true","1.8"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","6","19","0","0"

That being said this port is just that. a port of an old game.  It's based on the ps3 version not the gamecube version which has more features but still no voice acting for the skits(the biggest flaw this game has. I played a few battles and ran around and did the intro mission and it seemed to be the exact same experience I had before, which is one of the best games I've played.  The game takes about 80 hours to complete the first time around, all of the reviews say 40-60 hours but if you are actually playing the game like a reasonable person without using guides and trying to get all of the titles, skills, identify all of the enemies, get all the obilisk, end game summons, items, and skits then no it will take you longer. There are things you can't get without beating the game 3 times minimum, which means to get everything you have to plan out your playthoughs meticulously to be able to get everything in three runs, worth mentioning if you want to do that kind of thing. There is an affinity level with the characters that affects cutscenes and changes key plot points(characters living or dying!).  There are events you will easily miss out on entirely on which provide significant character development.  After 1k hours, I was still finding new paths and cutscenes in this game. By intentionally going the direction I wasn't supposed to which in one or two instances did pay off and rewards you with seeing areas before they are destroyed and getting altered scenes and dialogue.\nIt's a great game with a ton of depth, character development and a story you can get behind.","February 14","true","0.4"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katosu/recommended/372360/","Katosu","Caex Vaeriar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katosu/","156 products in account","This game is something I can not recommend enough to everyone to play through at least once. However - at the same time, I must take a moment to give words of caution. If 1080p and 60 FPS are huge selling points for you, this game might not be for you. And, unfortunately, due to a poor system in the port, the game is unplayable with certain OS's. Do research first and make sure you can play the game before buying - buyer beware on this.\n\nHowever, I do think that this is a great game for those it works for. I happen to be one of the ones who had no issue running this, so my experience was only positive. I loved getting to revisit the lands of Sylvarant and Tethe'alla. The game is exactly how I remembered it, for all the good and bad.\n\nThe fight system is its strongest point. The LMB (Linear Motion Battle System) is just as great as ever, and the lack of free run, while confiding, is something you become accustomed to very quickly. I've missed this system, compared to more recent tales systems.\n\nThe story is still as corney, cringe-worthy cheese as it ever was. At the end of the game, you feel yourself rolling your eyes a little at just how cheesy the story is.\n\nBut that's part of the charm of the game, isn't it?\n\nThe graphics are still enjoyable, though - I will say, it feels like a slight downgrade from the original. There are some jagged issues around characters that I get on my system, and I am not sure if it's a port of personal setting issue.\n\nSoundwise, the MUSIC of tales of symphonia is as amazing as it ever was. Fatalize still gives me that pumped up feeling it always gave me when I was a kid. The angelic themes for some fights still make me feel as though I'm fighting an insurmountable foe - whcih makes it all the more sweet when I beat them.\n\nSo. Overall. I can recommend the game - but do your homework. Ask yourself. Do you care about 1080p/60fps, or do you care if the game is good? And, can your system run it? Do not be afraid to refund if it cannot. Ignore the naysayers and decide for yourself.","February 14","true","55.3"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

Im not all that into the tales series, but this game has always been a favourite of mine. I really enjoyed playing the co-op on the gamecube, and although I had an unrealistic hope that Iwould be able to do the campaign, I have to shill this game really hard.\n\nSolid 30-40 hours heres with my personal favourite anime from a Japanese RPG. Really fun and engaging battle, and even though the plot is really tropey i really enjoyed it. The slight grapĥical touches and the upresing really help too, but cel shading is relatively future proof regardless. it's a lot like Final Fantasy X, but the battle system is in real time.\n\n8.5/10, would definitely recommend, even if it does sound like all the voice acting was recorded with a cell phone\n\nEDIT: I've had no problems at all with lag or problems with crashing. A lot of people are upset that in its current state its locked at certain resolutions, but - this is a port of a PS3 game that was made for the gamecube in 2004. I really don't know what Jim Sterling expected; I think this is a completley serviceable port and about what I expected.

Zero issues on startup.  Slight delay (5-6 seconds) when selecting the Save menu or the Custom menu for settings.  They are working on the Delay.\n\n\nCons:\nFPS Locked to 30 (if that's your thing, so be it, for me... meh)\nPS3 port, of the PS2 version.  So there are a few things patched that may trip you up later in the game if you are looking at a guide for certain things.  A certain event later in the game becomes harder to initiate, you must work at it, and will probably take a guide to get to happen.  Other changes being some minor "exploit" type things.\n\n\nOverall, the game is great and the port is as good as the source material (PS3 game).  You may be disappointed if you come in expecting something more.  But if you want to play the game, it's a good option.

So again it ruins the nostalgia for me.\n\nYou can change the resolution to 1080x1920 in the customization menu, but the Internal resolution locked to 720p regardless of resolution.\n\nThe game is locked on 30fps and on the Gamecube it could go up to 60fps. But even on the Gamecube it did not run smooth on 60fps, but now the combat feels really sluggish. So I know this is the PS3 port, but still a fps lock on the PC makes no sense.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nSo I will recommend the game because of the nostalgia and the gameplay itself is fine, but these are issues need to be fixed in order to be considered a good/decent pc port.","February 1","true","38.4"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","0"

Much like Tales of Zestiria, the first PC "Tales of" game, the framerate is locked at 30fps.\n\nThere appears to be no mouse support, yet the mouse still is visible in fullscreen mode.\n\nStartup time is a bit long, and the game hangs whenever accessing the Save, Load, and Customize(options) menus, both from the title screen or while playing. Don't think it crashed, it has taken up to a minute for me to load any one of these menus(and on a PC that can flawlessly run Tales of Zestiria on max). All other menus appear to have no issues, both in and out of combat. With the exception of the initial startup and those three menus, the game load times are as fast as expected.\n\nI enjoy that they included the original theme/opening, rather than the one that the US received in the GameCube release, and the presence of the Japanese voiceovers is nice.\n\nAs a long time JRPG player, and a long time fan of the "Tales of" series, with Tales of Symphonia being my favourite, I would highly recommend Tales of Symphonia to anyone that loved the GC or PS3 release, anyone who enjoys other "Tales of" games, and to anyone that loves a good JRPG with an amazing storyline.\n\nI myself can't wait to get the chance to just sit down and dive back into Sylvarant, and head off to regenerate the world.","February 1","true","0.9"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","34","10","29","2","0"

The only Tales game I've played so far was Tales Of The Abyss for 3DS which was a good experience so I might be a bit biased. My short review would be: Nope.

But instead of shoving this important moral of always trying to make others understand down my throat, the developers chose the usual stuff of friendship and I-can-do-what-I-want-when-I-believe-in-myself. This creates shallow phrases and dialogues like: "What's the matter?" "N-nothing, let's go on." even if it is so very obvious what's going on (Colette is just "fine", always).\n\nThe game constantly tries to create problems out of thin air just by not letting the characters use their brain. There are so many logical flaws in the story and the writing is just cringe-worthy sometimes... Why did Lloyds friends had to "sacrifice" themselves with the overdramatically chosen words: "Go on without me and defeat Yggdrasil". Yeah, as if he could do that by himself and oh wonder, he mustn't because they are rescued by a stupid and unnecessary deus ex machina kind of twist. Another example: Why didn't Lloyd destroy the cruxis crystal of Yggdrasil even though he knew exactly, that the soul of a person survives inside of it (Preseas sister for example)? Well, because the game would've just been over but is this really the only way of telling your story?\n\nNext thing: the group almost never thought of the consequences of their actions or in the wrong moments and just took the best hint available even if it comes from an enemy. They didn't even thought about the consequences of other peoples decisions: "Well, that boss we just defeated is reaching to a console, should we stop him?" "Nah, that would make things easier for us and the npc over there must die so that we can mourn a few minutes".\n\nOverall I'm kind of offended that the game tried to take me for a fool. After just a few hours it came to me that this game is for children but I gave it a chance (Tales Of The Abyss had a similar approach and ended kinda good) but so many aspects were annoying that I often had to Alt-F4 it to get a break (*cough* friggin earth temple *cough* why couldn't they just shove the damn gnome aside?). The lawful good alignment of the whole group (except Zelos) made it very difficult to immerse into their decisions.\n\n\nThose were the flaws that bothered me as a roleplayer, the ones that made me cry out in frustration as a gamer were as follows:\n\nThe AI - yeah I know that this game is old but come on, my healer spams Healing Circle on herself (standing alone) instead of using Revitalize for the whole group and if I order her to do so, she just forgets the order when interrupted; the other fighters sometimes just stand around while I clash with everything I got and instead of waiting for me to restore the AP of the caster he runs to the front, dies and when revived, casts where he stands while dying again.\n\nGetting stuck on every edge possible - the temple of Volt was not that difficult but trying not to fall off even if you step lightly was just a matter of the engine.\n\nScripted fights - if you want me to lose, let me lose in a cutscene where I don't have the illusion that I can change anything but letting me fight two times in a row against opponents that spam me with instant killing attacks is just awful.\n\nItem wars - Some people like grinding, I don't. At the normal difficulty setting, no enemy (except the mimic) in a random encounter could even scratch me but in a boss fight I had to access my inventory very often just to keep going. Is this the way it's meant to be? I got it, no problem here but the difference between normal encounters and boss fights was strange.\n\nThe double endboss mechanic - what the **** was the purpose of the final form of Yggdrasil? It didn't made any sense!\n\nAnnoying background sounds - For example the rollercoaster, why did it had to be so loud?!\n\n\nAfter all this ranting there are of course good things that must be mentioned:\nInteractive combat system and Unison Attack\nQuick jumps and transports (even though the boat was completely useless after you got the Rheiards)\nSide quests and interaction with npcs outside of the main story line\n"Choices" that differ certain aspects of the story\nOpen world(s)\nInterchangeable characters for your team (even though you are forced to use certain characters at some fights)\nSome dungeon mechanics\nI will try Tales of Zestiria next, here's hoping that this comes with a better story and character choice but since Bandai Namco seems to love stereotypes, I'm kind of reluctant with my anticipation... So far I liked JRPGs, not this one.\n\nOh and Regal, thank you for not using your hands for saving the world and stuff, because your personal and selfish choice is of course much more important.","March 2","false","38.7"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","18","0","0"

I've been playing it at least once a year since it came out in 2003, and tried out every single port of it (all uhh, two of 'em).  This is a port of the PS3 version which was itself inspired from the Japan-exclusive PS2 version.  More titles, more skits, more events, more bosses and harder enemies in general on harder difficulties, making Mania an actual challenge (unless you have 10x exp).\n\nDespite being a port of the PS3 version, it still manages to be superior and that for three reasons:\n\n1. Sure the internal resolution is locked to 720p, but so was the PS3 version, and the original was 480p.  Plus, it can be resized and played on windowed mode.\n2. It doesn't take ages to save and load the game... in fact, it's instant; I keep getting surprised and saving twice in a row by mistake.\n\nWithout a doubt the best version of the best Tales game, ignore the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ FPS ♥♥♥♥♥ littering both the store page and forums with absolute filth just because a 13 years old game doesn't support 4K and 60 FPS; the game is amazing and yet they manage to make it even better with every port they make.\n\nUPDATE:  Seems that when you do rebind your keys, it doesn't register properly and prevents you from doing puzzles, so it's a good thing the default controls are good enough.","February 1","true","19.1"," 5 of 28 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","5","28","0","5"

The problem i have with this game is who the hell thought putting this garbage of title system in the game was a good idea? Not only do you need a guide to get all the titles no you also have to play the game at least 4 times through to get all of them and thats just a dumb and boring way to extend the play time. Another problem is that the game doesnt register controller inputs anymore after you tab out of the game and have to restart the whole game to fix it. The camera controll on the world map is also bad. So if you want to play this game than just for the nostalgia or you dont care about 100% it otherwhise its just bad.","April 24","false","5.6"," 1 of 21 people (5%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","5","1","21","3","0"

The rest of the game might be pretty awesome, but unless I watch a playthrough on youtube, I'll never know.","April 25","false","4.7"," 6 of 37 people (16%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","16","6","37","4","0"
