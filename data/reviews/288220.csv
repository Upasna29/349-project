"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/288220/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is an early access review, so my opinion will likely change once the game moves out of beta.\n\nHaving only played a couple routes so far, I'm quite excited for the finished product.  Backstage Pass is your standard otome (girl main character) dating sim/visual novel; perform tasks to skill up attributes which open up options for you as you target each guy to romance.  There's a little more to it than that, but for the most part that's the game.  If that doesn't really sound like your thing, you may want to pass on this one.\n\nYes, the game is still littered with bugs, but those are being actively rooted out and squashed as the devs move through beta.  If you can get past the issues, though, the game has a TON of promise.  The artwork is beautiful, drawing inspiration from Japanese sources while adding a nice touch of western flavor, and some of the CG's are simply gorgeous.  The UI is one of the better ones I've seen for this type of game, especially since there are some pretty horrendous ones out there; you'd be surprised at just how distracting a bad UI can be.\n\nI've played quite a few translated Japanese language otoge before, and it always feels like something is slightly off with them (some more than others).  Perhaps it's the cultural differences, but I find well written English Visual Novels to be a much easier/more enjoyable read, and Backstage Pass is no exception.  The characters feel real with their own distinct personalities that somewhat fall into standard archetypes, but are more fleshed out and human than in other games.  Our protagonist, Sian, is a believable young woman who has her faults but isn't a meek little lamb waiting for one of the guys to sweep her away.  Outside of a lull in events further into the story (which is being addressed with some added scenes) the plot moves along nicely.  The writing is fluffy - meet guy, become friends, fall in love, etc.  I haven't come across anything that's overly dramatic or deep, but that's okay, sometimes I want a little less drama and a little more romance in my games. On a final note about the writing, I haven't come across any completely unbelievable situations nor have any of the characters done anything so stupidly groan worthy that I'm facepalming out of incredulity.  These characters are written like human beings, and they are placed in believable situations that make sense for the story.  That is a HUGE plus for me.\n\nAs a slower reader, each of the two routes I played took me between 3 to 4 hours to complete, and I didn't get the endings I was aiming for, so replaying to complete CGs and aiming for achievements will likely double the play time per route.  I would estimate that with the 4 main romanceable guys and 3-4 hidden routes, total play time for completing everything in the game could easily bring you well over the 20 hour mark, especially once the voice overs are added which will slow down gameplay a bit.  A completionist by nature, I can see myself logging at least that much play time into this game.\n\nI realize there's a sentiment that the price of the game is too hefty for what it is, and to a certain extent I understand that complaint.  However, Backstage Pass offers much more than your standard Renpy EVN, the quality is better, more CG's, and the overall high polish even in this state of development is evident compared to what most other genre games are offering with a $20+ price tag  (and believe me, I've played some that I felt completely ripped me off, but that's totally not the case here).  It plays smoother and is closer to what you might get out of a Japanese dating sim, which is pretty remarkable considering this game is made by a small group of dedicated fans.\n\nIf Backstage Pass were to be released finished in its current state, it would be better than 90% of the EVN out there right now, but the devs are determined to continue adding to and fleshing out the game.  With full voice acting and additional hidden routes on the way (including a couple of yuri for those who are interested in them), Backstage Pass may very well become my favorite EVN.  Keep an eye out for this one once it moves from Early Access to Official Release.","June 1, 2014","true","2.0"," 105 of 119 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","105","119","2","3"

It's a game of good quality but the waiting for the game to get past beta stage got me weary. I was honestly very enthusiastic, preordered the game the moment it was possible because I couldn't wait to see how the system worked.\n\nI was dazzled by the pretty art and the GUI. However, I also noted the story didn't have enough backing to get past the famous RE:Alistair stage. Pretty art, short story and few small scenes. They share the same basis. But I feel like it lacks a little more story and dating considering this one is no freebie. This game should have more story line which is why I quickly told myself to replay it once it was complete... but then again, considering the last news our dear dev made, this is basically the storyline which I find a little lacking.\n\nIf all I'm waiting for right now is the voice, I can tell you I'm not going to play again.\n\nBesides, I have been waiting for over a year now to see more of this and I am tired. I am very, very tired to see that the game is not finished.","June 21, 2015","false","0.3"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","56","62","0","0"

The characters are lovely, the art is beautiful, and what I've heard of the voice acting so far is fantastic. Sian, the heroine, is also a very believable character who is better than most other vn/dating sim protagonists I've come across. There's also a huge amount of represenation of difference races, sexualities in this game and multiple characters with ranging disabilities.\n\nMy only complaint is that there may just be little too many possible endings. In my game, Sian and John were dating and I merely was half a heart away from having full hearts with him..and absolutely nothing happened in the end. It was a little disappointing since I wasn't sure where I had gone wrong and it's tough to find guides online.\n\nIt could be helpful for Sakevisual to include a walkthrough for each character online. I realize that many people enjoy finding out on their own, but if someone wants to unlock every CG and is just missing one or two they don't know how to get...an official walkthrough could be very beneficial.\n","October 10, 2014","true","4.1"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","0"

The art is very good. The dialogue is okay. I looked up all the information I could on the internet, made all the right choices, and ended up alone at the end.\n\nThis game has been in Early Access for over a year now, with no updates to the game, and no word from the creators. Their "weekly updates" on their blog stopped in May 2014, and after that there are just a handful of tweets and tumbles about  voice recording in April 2015. Frankly I would consider calling it abandoned: they've suckered $30 out of enough people in Early Access and their work is done.\n\nThis game does not feel at all like it would be worth $30 even after completion, much less at early access. Consider waiting until the alleged "release" before picking up this one.","August 11, 2015","false","5.5"," 51 of 67 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","51","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyndersFlame/recommended/288220/","CyndersFlame","CyndersFlame","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CyndersFlame/","22 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far I've played Backstage Pass for about 12-13 hours trying to get my hands on all the paths that are currently available. So far the only bugs I found was when Lloyd was going to meet Sian at Pho 24 to discuss what to do about Benito's magic production. The background was Sian's dorm room. Even though its not really a big scene, just thought I would point it out.\n\nNow onto my real review. Personally, I LOVE this game. Sure it's a bit short now, but once the game is completed, it will be longer with more dialogue, more routes, and more endings. The game is actually really realistic. You're given many different types of people with many different types of personalities. Plus, the original soundtrack goes perfectly with every scene. Also, everything is set up nicely and runs pretty smoothly. The storyline is also pretty good, sometimes it can be a tad sad. Other times it just makes you wanna giggle.\n\nI've played other otome, stat-raising, dating sims, and visual novels before. Backstage Pass has amazing originality, creativity and art. If you're wondering to buy this game or not, I recommend playing some free stat-raising/otome/dating sims before buying this game. A good free one is Re Alistair ++ (by Sakevisual). You can also play demos such as Always Remember Me, The Flower Shop: Winter in Fairbrook and more (both from from Winter Wolves). (EDIT!) I forgot! There is also another free amazing stat raising game you should try out. It's called 'Heartstring Bugs' and it's by Unbroken Hours. It's long, has 5 main guys and is over the course of 3 years. AND ITS FREE. ERMAHGERD. Go check it out! (End of edit. 6/14/14)\n\nSo far I've focused on Adam x2 and Benito x1. I'm going to start John and Matthew after I'm done writing this xD. But this game will truly come out to be something special. I can't wait for the voice acting to be done.MICAH SOLUSOD (voice of Soul Eater Evans from Soul Eater) WILL BE VOICING ADAM. I literally had a spazz attack when I first found out!!!... *cough cough* Ehem.\n\nThe price for the game is amazing at just $30 with all that's going to be included when the product is officially done. And replay is going to be high trying to get all the CG's, scenes, Steam achievements, Steam trading cards, items in game, unlocking new places to shop/hang out, and try any and all possible routes.\n\nRight now my current rating for Backstage Pass is 8/10. Which is stunning because this is only the Beta version! I've played a few finished games, and their no where near as good as Backstage Pass. If you want to follow Sakevisual about new updates on the game, visit their official website weekly. You can also sign up for mail updates, follow them on Twitter, Like their page on Facebook, view their Tumblr and more xD","June 8, 2014","true","25.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","2"

Since buying it last year, I've heard nothing about the development, or any predictions on when the game will be released in it's full version.

I have not finished the game, as there is ALOT of content even if it isn't "complete". If you are a fan of otomes, and have the cash to spare, I highly reccomended this game. The newly added voices are a nice additon as well, and for the most part very impressive and appealing. The plot is fun and each route is a different experiance. I will will say it is a tad challenging and this is nothing new for fellow stat raising games. However, the art is really nice, the characters likable, the story is interesting, and I found myself relating to Sian, the mc, much more than any other game I've played. It is frustrating to play over and over, not getting the correct end, but it is possible. The game is actually pretty hilarious (especially John's Route. It was hard to get a good ending but oh my god a certain "conversation" had me laughing hysterically.  My point is, you have to be willing to commit time into the game and have patience in order to enjoy it. It is well worth the price for all that we're getting, and have yet to receive.","January 2","true","40.3"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","0"

I have been waiting for it to come out for a while now, and I have played all of Sakevisual's other games, The artwork is far superior to most EVNs that you see coming out. It has an animated opening and closing. You play as a female, freshman college student named Sian, who has been trained in movie makeup. Sian's friend Adam is an up an dcoming singer, who Sian does the makeup for, and John is his producer. You have to keeps your grades up to keep your scholarship (this hit home since I am in college on scholarships), you have to work to get money to buy things, and there are stats to raise to get your guy. There are 4 guys, Adam, John, Benito, and Matthew, and each has a friendship and a romance route. There are other secret character routes, but I have not discovered them all yet. Each main guy has about 14 cgs, and then there is a section for other cgs. Did I mention that the cgs are gorgeous, Tooya did an amzing job. There are a total of 15 endings (8 total from the main guys, 1 alone ending, and 6 others that I have not discovered). The storyline is well written, and it is fun to see Sian be sarcastic. I did not run across any bugs while playing, and I did not notcie any incorrect grammar. It is a stat riaisng sim, which I do not particularly enjoy, but there is enough scenes in between so that the game does not become monotonous. Each week you pick what you are going to do during that week, and sometimes depending on the date, stat level, etc. scenes will unlock during the week. Then on the wekend you can hang out with a friend, sleep, use items, bake cupcakes,go to the arcade, go to a restuarant, or go shopping. Different places unlock depending on events you unlock during the game.This game is one of the better EVNs that I have played, it is on the same level as Dandelion, Nameless, and Starry Sky in Sring. I can't wait till the game is completely finished, and I can't wait to see Sakevisual's next game.","June 9, 2014","true","8.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wingedasarath/recommended/288220/","wingedasarath","WingedAsarath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wingedasarath/","30 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo far this has been one of the most addictive otome games I have played, and certainly one of the best OEL (original English language) ones. As of writing this review, I have played through the game twice, starting on 1st January 2016.\n\nPOSITIVES:\nThe English voice acting is excellent. Some anime fans may recognise some of the cast, which is a nice touch. I was particularly fond of the acting for John, Adam, Lloyd, and Matthew.\nGreat value for money. At this point I have logged 11 hours of gameplay, and I still have 15 of the game's listed endings to unlock. For a game featuring this much content, plus an animated opening & closing, as well as full voice work, the price is very reasonable.\nFully animated opening and closing sequence (although the ending one takes a lot of work to unlock, and I haven't seen it yet) done by Studio DEEN (notable for their work on several anime series). A real treat for any anime fans playing, and a nice touch which helps this game stand shoulder to shoulder with its Japanese otome competition.\nBeautiful art. A few of the CGs felt a little off-model, but for the most part the art in this game is particularly gorgeous.\nEqually beautiful music, that I did not find overly repetitive (although your own mileage may vary).\nExcellent characters and varying storylines, with a highly relatable protagonist who is independent and fun to play as. The game also features a diverse selection of characters of various ethnic/country origins and sexualities.\nNEGATIVES:\nStill a few bugs. As this game is on Early Access, this is to be expected, and at this stage I have not encountered any game breaking ones (and even one which unlocked an achievement early). These can be reported in the game's Bug Report discussion thread, which is currently very active and seeing a lot of player participation.\nThis game can be very tedious and challenging. It can be disappointing to put several hours into a playthrough only to not get one of the listed endings. The fact the game has so many options and possibilities also makes it quite grind-heavy, especially for completionists. It's fairly standard for the stat-raising genre, however, and those used to this style of game should have no problems.\nCould benefit with some official guidance/documentation from the developers. There are complete walkthroughs out there written by fans, but they can be awkward to track down (I only found a complete one a few hours ago after two days of playing). The game has a lot of complex mechanics and stats, and I feel the game would benefit from some sort of official guide or document explaining how these work, at minimum. For example, there is no obvious explanation as to what the star meter under the characters means in the stat menu.\nOverall, this game is highly enjoyable and an excellent addition to the genre, which I thoroughly recommend. If you can put up with the grind (and particularly if consulting guides and walkthroughs doesn't bother you) you will love this game. A fantastic addition to Sakevisual's game repertoire, which sets the gold standard for OEL visual novels.","January 3","true","11.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LorenaFA/recommended/288220/","LorenaFA",".:|:Lorena:|:Ray:|:.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LorenaFA/","133 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverall Score from me: 5.5/10.\n\nI realise that the game is not yet complete, if It ever gets updated and fully finished I'll adjust my review accordingly. Keep in mind, that I've played many many many Otome style visual novel games, and there are basically three main types that exist. Stat building, choice maker/visual novel, point and click/adventure.\n\nThis one is mainly a stat builder but also is reliant on choices you make in relation to the character you're pursuing.\n\nFirst the numbers.\nGameplay 4/10. There is no option to skip the mini cutscenes during the classes/work week, or making cupcakes, so if you're going for doing things efficiently and making 20 or so cupcakes it takes forever. The email system is critical for some of the game paths and EXTREMELY EASY TO MISS. Which means unless you save often you could miss half of the requirements for some of the game paths. The game length is too long in the worst way because of how long it takes you to complete the actual week day planning, (A "save this schedule" option would be great as well) And it is very difficult to monitor your character's stress levels while paying attention to the email system, and go out on enough dates with the bachelor of your choice. There are also numerous bugs, such as one on Matthew's path that if you press the skip button it occasionally brings you back to the start menu, on loading a save. Another one is that if you have skip on, and you bake cupcakes it makes that faster but can be turned off if clicking in the general area as well. I've also had certain event flags not start when they're supposed to so there's a few kinks that need working out.\n\nMusic 6/10. The music in this game is fairly well done, but one thing that I personally believe is that the music cannot actually be turned down low enough without being fully mute. I'm thinking this will be fixed when they add voices and such to the game, but that's my only issue there.\n\nArtwork 8/10 The art in this game is very beautiful. The only thing I would like to point out is that there are a few cutscene pictures that distort the character's faces in a way that it's not attractive, but overall it's really well done and the character design is really good.\n\nMy current viewpoints:\n*All of the paths are EXTREMELY difficult. As in pedantic and overwhelmingly difficult. I have yet to unlock one perfect ending with any of the characters, despite following guides and doing everything in my power for this. This game needs a walkthrough more than a guide.  Matthew's path for example is a bit unclear as I'm not sure what you need to say to Nicole in order to make things work or what stats you need to focus, as even with maximum charisma, specialized cupcakes, dates and popularity I didn't get the complete ending. The game takes way too long to complete due to needing to re-input every single command into the schedule every day.\n\nI think that a lot of the game could be made smoother/more user friendly just by making the email button flash red on recieving a new email, and having the option to choose what sian's main "ideas" are at the start of the game, such as wanting to start a blog for popularity or practice speaking for charisma. It'd also be a lot better to add more stress relief books to the stores, and to make it easier to access the arcade as raising your gpa for another date-spot, plus trying to balance stats is a bit pedantic and difficult. It's not a bad game, but this goes beyond challenging to a painful grind and a lot of work. I still haven't gotten one perfect ending, though i'm not sure if it is related to the game or something i'm doing wrong, and there are no full guides or walkthroughs that completely cover the exact things people need to do to get the endings.\n\nI'd still reccommend this for the story, but until it's finished and some of the bugs are removed, it's not a full reccommendation from me.","May 6, 2015","true","22.7"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

But either way they need to figure it out soon before the game is no longer being noticed in a good way.\n\n**Update 1/16/015**\nThey added voices (Which sounded pretty good) then removed them in another update and then it feels like the development has been pretty on and off, they have still been working on it but it'd be a lot better for the testers if they gave more updates, so it is currently slow, they haven't stopped development but yea. . .\n**Back to original review**\n\n\n\nWhat I think so far of the game as an early access:\n\nI'm glad that the creators of this have thought of new ways to this game less bland and the same ol' same ol'.\n\nI would say that once it's finished it will be worth the money, you can tell a lot of effort went into this and that makes me all the more glad that it's all coming together! None of the date-able characters are bland or annoying, they all have pretty good character development and all and all I had tons of trouble choosing which one to go with.\n\nEarly access flaws:\n\nSo this is indeed an unfinished version at the moment, so there were a few bugs, although I'll be glad to say none that were game breaking, the worst one that I encountered was when I brought up the in game reply to mail screen the sound started skipping and it froze for about 3-4 seconds, it did that about four or so times, no biggie.\n\nAnother thing is that sometimes during transition it fades twice, comes back tot he screen, then fades again to show the correct thing, not so much a bug as something that needs polish, and of course there are some moments where you can tell that more is going to be added.\n\nWhat do I think overall?\n\nIf you want to be able to help the creators with feedback and are patient then, go for it! As long as they finish this game (Which I believe they will.) then it'll be worth the price.\n\nIf you're not good at waiting and you don't care to write a review or give feedback then wait, wait until the full version of the game is released.","August 10, 2014","true","198.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Yes, people have been very vocal about their dissatisfaction with how long the game has been in early access and development. I myself was very hesistant to buy it and the game just sort of sat on my wishlist for a long time. I have been pleasantly surprised and happy with what the game has to offer right now though.\n\nAt it's basic core it's a stat raising dating so, so if that's not your thing the game is probably not for you as stats seem to play a very vital role in the gameplay itself. I'm only about a month into the game itself but already have a to keep a close eye on certain stats. Thankfully the most annoying fatigue stat doesn't rise TOO terribly much with activities and it goes down by a lot when you have a successful rest.\n\nThe most recent addition has been the voice acting and while I'll admit it was a little jarring at first, I've gotten used to it. Most of the voices do really fit the characters and just give a little more life into the story itself. There are little things here and there like random lines that aren't voiced or times when the volume of the line is very loud or very soft, but it will definitely make the game that much better when Sian is voiced as well.\n\nSpeaking of Sian, she is an...interesting main character. At first she appears to have a little bit of that quintessential sort of wallflower trait of otome mcs have? Thankfully she has proven to be a more than one-dimensional in her character development so far so hopefully the opinon that I continue to form of her will be positive. I really enjoy the fact that she's sort of behind the scenes in the industry as well and the fact that she is confident in her talents as a make-up artist and knows she deserves to do what she's doing with it. Things could have gone very badly if she was doubtful in herself throughout the entire game. The other character introduced so far have been very charming and likeable, the four love interests have very different personalities and different ways they interact with Sian so that has been interesting to see so far.\n\nIf you're interested in the game at all and have been on the fence about buying it, I would highly reccomend picking it up. Yes it still has a fair amount of bugs and such to work out, but it really is a wonderful game so far. If you're not a fan of VNs with tedious stat raising then perhaps this isn't the game for you.","February 13","true","11.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Each character is drawn very well in a consistent, crisp style. This goes as well for the CGs, which features the same style as the sprites.\n\nI liked the story. It was cute, and progresses very well. Each of the characters are unique from one another and develop throughout the span of the game. This includes the MC, whose personality is refreshing from the typical otome heroine. I haven't played it since it was updated with the voice work, so I have no opinions on how everyone sounds. It has such a high replayability as well. There are many endings to explore, and several endings within each character.\n\nStat raising gets repetative, but for this sort of game, this is to be expected. The dates also fall into this same loop. Again, I don't expect unique dialogue for each time I take the same person out to the same place, so I wasn't too upset.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys otome games and/or visual novels.","January 19","true","11.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It has a nice story and there is a lot you can do.  But still no voiceover which is kinda sad. It's been in Early Access stage for too long and still there is no update. Sakevisual makes great otome games. But there hasn't been any news about BSP for a long time. Also the art is unique, I can't say that I like it too much. But considering the other otome games on Steam, Backstage Pass is a treasure. There are lots of defiencies but the content of the game covers them up. There are like 16 endings, (as I remember) 7 romance options, -3 of them are hidden- and tons of stuff to do.\n\nYou should definitely buy it if you're looking for an otome game which has a nice story, lots of endings and a nice art.

I didn't notice any real bugs, though it's obvious that some routes are still (sadly) unavailable, so I'm definitely looking forward to the updates when they open. The game has really great graphics, interesting storylines, intriguing characters, and an easy to use stats control system. My only real complaint right now would be that the game REALLY makes you work for achievements (10 hours in, 4 romance routes played, only two achievements!).\n\nThat said, what really makes the game great isn't the graphics or the characters or the storyline, it's the way the game represents and portrays social anxiety and other mental illness with sensitivity and heart. None of the characters shown with mental illness (and there's three I've found so far, including Sian, the main/player character) are mocked or made the butt of joke or just written off as "crazy" because of their disability (one character even calls out this kind of reaction within the game!). I didn't realize Backstage Pass would have this kind of representation going in -- I thought it'd just be an interesting industry-based game -- so I was pleasantly surprised to see it and how well it was handled.\n\nI also really appreciated some of the realism to the industry element as well. It's obviously a "light" version, compared to the real thing, but the terminology and the basic shape seems accurate, given what I know from friends who do work in the industry.\n\nFinally, there's a ton of content for each route. It took me about four hours to complete my first route (and sadly I got a bad ending) and another hour and a half to complete the next route I tried (with the skip function used liberally). Each subsequent route took about the same hour and a half. Right now the four main routes (Benito, Adam, John, Matthew) are all open and I've only completed the romance routes on all four. So I expect another good six hours to unlock the friendship routes and even more game time to try the non-romance routes suggested by the achievements (I'm definitely looking forward to being a director!). So there's plenty of story in the game and you won't finish everything in four or five hours like a lot of VNs. So if you're worried about the price (and it does feel like a lot of money for a VN), think of the potential amount of time you'll be playing. Not to mention what is apparently in the pipeline for the game (more routes, fully voiced, etc.) so it's definitely worth the money even at this stage in the game.\n\nDefinitely one of the better VNs I've ever played (and I'm definitely planning on trying out Sakevisual's other games after playing this!).","October 15, 2014","true","19.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It's not worth this money! There are a lot of free otome games which are much better than this one.\nThe biggest flaw of this game is a lack of passion. Lack of passion in the story, lack of passion in the characters, lack of passion in relationships between the MC and the guys, lack of passion in everything! The story was extremely boring and the guys didn't stir up almost any emotions in me.\n\nHow come the heroine has something like 50 dates(if not more) with a certain character and only in the end of the route they share a kiss? The heroine isn't a little girl! Why she behaves like she's 14? Does the author really think a mature man like Jhon(I assume he's something like 35 years old) would date a girl SOOO MUCH TIME before trying to kiss her? Does the author of this story think it's realistic?! Or maybe Jhon and other guys are all impotents and spadoes??\n\nI thought I would start to sleep while reading the routes. The plot was too predictable, slow, monotonous, lacking dynamics. All of the characters behaved like asexual virgins! I'm sorry but it was one of the most boring otome game I've ever played and half of the time I wanted to press "skip". Not to mention how tedious and repetitive was the game process(too much of stat raicing)\nAnd Matthew's voice didn't sound good. Does this guys smoke three packages of Marlboro per day?? The voice didn't match his personality at all.\n\nOne of the big and only pluses of this game is a big quantity of CGs. But the interaction between Sian(the heroine) and the guys is so dull that most of the CGs from the game have nothing special about them.","March 20","false","19.4"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","1"

Mostly focusing on Adam with a side of Benito. The weekly planning was nice, the sleeping didn't decrease the stats so much I felt like I wasn't advancing at a good rate and dropping out of college would have required an actual effort to do.\n\nMy biggest issue, and I address this because it won't likely be changed as it's such a huge part of the game, is the protagonist. I do not like her at all. She is at best a buzzkill and at worse she seems shallow. Way too often she responded to light banter with a blunt and logical response which was in no way fun to see. Also a protag bad in crowds is not really all too original which was a disappointment, but that seemed to be forgotten on extra day on the V/V set but remembered later for the sake of drama when it made little sense.\n\nA character like Nicole being the protagonist would have been much more likable. With Sian, I was making mean comments to my computer as it seemed like Sian was excusing the action of a boy sexually harassing someone (mall scene with the elf outfit and Nicole).\n\nThough the art was great and the opening cinamatic was polished and a great touch. One play through took 13 hours so I feel like I am getting my money's worth out of it and given a good range of handsome, different love interests to choose from. The continuity in Matt's route was impressive, if you gave him a gift early on he uses it to make something for you much later in the game. I was very impressed and pleased with this.\n\nI would suggest this to people who don't mind reading, as there is a large chunk in the beginning you kinda need to power though, once you get to the actual interactive part though it's very addictive, pretty put together for an early access game, and very fun.","June 4, 2014","true","12.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And I figured I’d write a quick review before it went off of sale. Check it here. It’s 45% off at the moment so: $16.50. This is the first time I’ve seen it on sale and I’ve had it on my wishlist for awhile. So, this may be the biggest discount we get. Or as it looks like they just recently added the voices it may be that as they move forward they are trying to garner more positive reviews. I skimmed through some of the negative reviews and some of the issues folks have with it appear to have been resolved. Also, it looks like they went a really LOOOOONNNGG time without updates. It’s an early access game and just BTW as it stands I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it for the $30 price tag.\n\nGame Play\n\nPretty straightforward. You are in school so part of your day will be filled with that and you have to decide what you want to with your free time: work, blog, study,go running, sleep, tutoring, go out with friends, or go out on the town. Each choice will effect your stats and your stats impact your relationships with other characters. Certain stats appeal to certain potential romantic interests.\n\nYou have dialogue choices while interacting with characters which will effect your relationships and what jobs and parties you choose to go to will impact your relationships and career options. Choose wisely.\n\nArt\n\nThe art in my view was in the plus column. It’s very well drawn and has a fair bit of variety. The opening video is animated (if you search backstage pass in my tags you will find a gif set of it). It’s cute. There is also an animated video at the end, but I don’t have it unlocked. Can’t wait to get it though.\n\nCharacters\n\nThere are several characters you can pursue. But as I haven’t successfully gotten them all....I can’t really talk about all the characters. My first playthrough I got  Benito as a romantic option. I didn’t find that route too difficult and didn’t need to go back to old saves to make it work. Benito is cute, younger than your character and has a backstory which you slowly uncover as you go along. Second playthrough I didn’t end up with anyone. But I was attempting at Adam. I can’t seem to figure him out. As I like to play games cold the first few times I may not figure him out until I find a walkthrough for assistance. I got John romantically pretty easily as well once I was focused. He’s cool headed, romantic and older. Honestly, my personal preference meant his interactions were the most fun. I also got to the romance option with Matthew. He is the most full in my opinion. He’s pretty and he’s social awkward. If that appeals....\n\nThere are also three side options to romance (at least I think so?). I haven’t managed to get any of them even though I did try. I think I may have gotten close with two of them as I did get additional scenes with them and phone number, but I haven’t been successful in in my pursuit yet.\n\nOverall\n\nThere are some funny moments, you will probably like at least one of the romanceable characters, you need to save often to go back and fix what you did if you make a mistake, and the gameplay is a bit tricky and if you aren’t invested will probably be annoying. I did have some issues with responsiveness like delays in clicking a button or sometimes it not clicking which was irritating. Not sure if that is just me or what.\n\nAnyway, I really enjoyed this game and I am excited to see what happens when we finally get a finished product!","February 9","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mama-owl/recommended/288220/","mama-owl","yasmean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mama-owl/","14 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNot a bad game; I'd say it's worth it if you're into the whole stat raising thing and like to go through a bunch of trial and error to get different endings, considering this one has 16 endings for you to spend more or less 80 hours on, considering that at least two of the routes I've already finished took me about 5 hours to complete (or maybe I'm just very slow).\n\nGetting straight to the point, it gets repetitive, expected out of a stat raising otome. I wouldn't say it's repetitive to the point you just want to bash your head into the computer screen though, seeing as there are certain events from time to time, depending on whether you accept an offer or not, on what you decided to do that week, and some specific things, which I accidentally did before looking at the guide and seeing that X thing would only trigger by doing Y and Z before.\n\nThe art also isn't bad; the backgrounds were nicely done, and the sprites for each character is "unique", I guess you could say. Many times I've seen otomes having some sort of same-face syndrome with their handsome men and cute girl sprites, after all. Considering this is the same artist that has worked on RE: Alistair, sakevisual's first project if I'm not mistaken, it's impressive how much they've improved (though I must also admit their other artworks are just as great). I guess my only problems with the sprites are Matthew's chin when in front view and Adam's palm tree hair, but other than that, they're all unique on their own ways.\n\nThough speaking of the characters, relating to their personalities, I did find them to be unique and endearing as well, or maybe the proper word would be amusing. Some dialogue lines too made me smirk to myself, mainly Mr. Newton's there, though some things seemed a tad bit forced, like the fanboy tutor (though he is still a lovely character). Then again, as much as I'd like to say there are no people that act the way he does, I have a friend that's pretty much like he is, both online and offline. The heroine was also nicely done, and a fresh change from the, usually, meeks ones I tend to see, mainly because my main focus tends to be Eastern otomes though, and social values all differ, but anyways. Depending on your choices, you can make her out to be hardworking, teasing and flirty at times, or a lazy bum that can even get expelled out of college. Though I don't really think there was much room for development for her, from start to finish, since she seemed pretty much the same to me, but my views may change as I go through other routes.\n\nAnother system I enjoyed is the ability to change clothes depending on the season, something like Tokimeki Memorial, there being certain styles the boys prefer and may mention about when in a date. My only peeve is that you couldn't wear things bought during other seasons, because I mean, I have shirts that I'll wear from Spring to Winter and the cycle continues. I can understand not wearing a thick jacket and a pair of boots during Summer, but a skirt or shirt bought during Spring should also be alright once Summer rolls around.\n\nAs for the voice acting, I'm not so sure on whether I enjoyed them or not; there were some parts where the cast did a good job, and others that seemed a bit too superficial. The voice choice for each character wasn't bad, you see, but I guess it just didn't feel very natural to me at certain points.\n\nNow finally, as for the story, I'd say it's pretty straightforward, though I don't have much to comment since I only finished two routes, at the moment. You raise your stats, you get job offers, get money to buy things, depending on your choices you may go for friendship or lover route, you can give them presents during Christmas or their birthdays, you can hang out, and in the end there's the usual life lesson one or both of the characters learn once their bond deepends enough. Though personally, at least the romantic endings, aren't so satisfying; you bone'em, and then that's it. It'd be interesting if there were some sort of after-story rather than just finishing it right at the moment, like showing how they're doing a few months after getting together. It just feels a little "incomplete" to me, as if the endings were done a bit on a rush.\n\nOverall, it's not a perfect game, but it's enjoyable and has its own charms, like many other games, I'd say. Bonus points for getting Mili to compose the opening there though; they're one of my favourites.","February 13","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game play is honestly fun and before you know it, hours have passed, however I think falling in love shouldn't be so difficult. I think the game would be 100% better if:\n\n1) It was completely finished (well duh lol)\n\n2) Allowed you to wear what you want regardless of season (it was quite annoying to have my outfit on point but could't wear it because it wasn't the right season) and also explain what the cool, cute, and classy stats for clothes are and how it effects the game or your romancing....\n\n3) Had an option where you could give gifts to boost your likeability on times other than christmas and birthdays. (Then again maybe playing how I would react to people in real life isn't the best idea to win over the bishounens. Although I did buy plenty of gifts and didnt have an option to bribe them to love me... goes to show money can't buy you romance.)\n\nI still recommend the game if you have the funds to get and don't mind spending 30$ for an unfinished game.

The characters are interesting and the art work is amazing. The characters you can interect with are charming. I already have a favorite character in the game. It's a perfect grafic novel for girls. I find some of the characters completely adorable. I also like how they use English names for the characters. I'm very imprested with thestory line considering it's the beta. I don't see any typos so far it's clear that the producers spent a lot of effort trying to make this a good game. I especally like how Matthew is shy dispite being a modle and the british voice John has. I would completely recommend this game to any girl who likes anime.

My other main problem is how slowly it's taking to complete the game. Yes, this is a widely stated complaint, but it's that way for a reason.\nAlso, the music tends to be too loud unless you mute it, though that will most likely be fixed when the voices are added in. Unlike most people, I don't seem to have much trouble on the routes, though I haven't gone on any of the friend routes yet.\nThe last problem I had made it difficult to finish certain routes, though this only happened once of twice. A glitch where the emails didn't show up occured, which made it so that I couldn't accept certain jobs, which effected some characters routes.\nOverall it was a good game, and I quite enjoyed it.","June 19, 2015","true","88.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But that's my own opinion.\nI thoroughly enjoyed the feature where you could change your character's outfits.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rimiko/recommended/288220/","Rimiko","Rimiko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rimiko/","19 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBackstage Pass is a really well made game, and for early access it seems quite polished to me! I really can't wait to be able to hear voice acting, because the samples sound good, and it would add a lot to the dialogue.  The dialogue is fun, and I found myself giggling on more than one occassion - this game really sucked me and got me excited to keep playing. I really wanted Sian to do her best, so I tried my hardest to build her good states and keep her career on track. Honestly, stat raising games can get a little tedious; I've played my fair share of them and while they've never particularly bothered me personally, I find Backstage Pass general has a good interplay between story and stat raising gameplay.\n\nNotably the art is fantastic, though I always felt Adam looked a little... awkward. I dunno, something about his sprite. But aside from that, I loved the character expressions, and the change in clothes, and the cg's were looooveellyyyy - I remember seeing the one where Benito broke his arm and I just - wow, nice gore dude!\n\nI have to say I love the way the story handles issues like social anxiety and other disorders as well - it's not mocking or insensitive, and it really made the whole experience and plot better as a whole. There was also the forum for Vice/Versus which I personally loved reading - the fans were funny and totally accurate to life. That's another thing about Backstage Pass - with a few exceptions, the dialogue often doesn't feel forced.\n\nHaving said all this however, I do have my gripes about the game. While it's mentioned that excercise is supposed to lower your stress, no matter what I did with it, my rates never really seemed to change, and it seemed I was having to sleep more often than not just to prevent Sian from getting sick, with no real improvement. This was frustrating, and if I hadn't been so convinced my stats just werent high enough, I would have just stopped having Sian excercise altogether.\n\nAnother thing, having only had the time to play through Benito's route, I'm not entirely sure if it's just my ending or what, but it ends verrrryyy suddenly. Sian and Benito kiss and pronounce love for one another and the game just ends. Suddenly I'm done playing. It was very jarring, and kind of completely tore me out of the experience - it was really frustrating. I didn't feel like I reached any closure. Forgive me if the comparison isn't known, but in Tokimeki Memorial you get a follow up from your year; "I did this well in school and this happened for me" etc, and then a short piece about the protagonist and their love interests continued relationship.\n\nI didn't feel that at all with the ending I got; Benito's arm was still broken, Sian's future was up in the air, and while I could speculate all I like about what happened after I never got any of that closure. Did Benito become world famous??? What happened to Sian's career? Did they end up travelling together? Did Benito ever talk to his parents?? Not even a little hint of that. They kissed and confessed their love and that was the end. I honestly thought my game messed up and reloaded a save but it was the same.\n\nSo basically, I really hope the endings are fleshed out way more in the future - and hey maybe it was just the route I took, or maybe I had to do something else?? I don't know. Either way, it was kind of a sad finish for a really good game.\n\nHaving said that, people should totally buy this game, it is well worth the price, and considering this is still early access there is plently of room for improvement in all areas! Backstage Pass is a wonderful game with a good outlook.","November 12, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The story line is realistic and the micro variations you can make within it are aplenty. It isn't 100% linear once your "path" is chosen, you can sucessfully romance guy A to 3 levels of sucess and your own personal life can be different as well.\n\n2. The game is much more interactive than a lot of other popular Otome titles, instead of a choice every 10 - 20 pages of dialogue you get one in stat collection every "week" of the 2ish year long story. The actual Dialogue choices are minimal though, your stats will weigh heavier in getting the best endings, even if you did all the dialogue correct you may not of gotten the right stats for example.\n\n3. The main character for once isn't a totally push over. She has one "weakness" or "ailment" that I'm almost certain they could of left out and it would of been fine, it isnt like memory loss so you can only talk every week so the MC doesnt say anything *cough* Amnesia:Memories *cough*. This MC voices good opinions and logical ones, especially on the more mature routes the game offers.\n\n4. The art work and English voice acting is great to be honest. I havn't had alot of english voice acted otome experiences, and at first Adam's voice annoyed me at the start but John's totally made up for it all.\n\nCons:\n\n1. The developers are slow on finishing this game, they are still adding more content and routes, so if the 4 routes are not enough for you right now, wait to buy it, though I'm excited to revisit the game later.\n\n2. There were moments in this game where I'd of died without the skip button, some of the stat stacking gets tedious as the game goes on and this puts you in a bit of a daze, then you might miss something ... like forgetting to check your emails for one week and then screwing yourself over on the romance because you missed something important and having to start over.\n\n3. No. 2 leads me into No. 3: Most Otome games have a pretty extensive rewind on choices, like if you misclick or decide oh crap im going to get a game over, rewind now. This game does not, while it has a rewind feature, it's small, and once you make a choice you can't fix it, you can rewind and see the dialogue but the check points for this are not chapter by chapter but instead are MUCH closer together. I missclicked on the mall button when i had to go another shop for an xmas gift... couldn't rewind, ended up not filling the romance bar to the max and had to start all over. So i guess, suck less and this isn't a con.","January 6","true","12.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's been a whole year and we still waiting for the voices . The story is too short for that price. Even the raising stats become boring at some point. The art good tough. Such a shame because I was a big fan of RE:Alistair and I was really waiting for this game thinking it will be a big hit. Now I'm just crying over my lost money. For that price go buy yo jin bo, same price but more storyline and dude to date. Avoid this game unless you have a lot of money in your pocket and even if you have that much money go spend it on charity at least someone will be happy. I might seem harsh but really I feel like the person who make the game was just thinking about riding the popular wave of otome games it's a shame for the community. A lot of free otome games are better than this one.","July 8, 2015","false","13.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

As a visual novel/otome fan myself, I knew I'd enjoy it from the start (as I've had my eye on this game ever since it was announced). I love the characters (I have my eye on you, Matthew...), the main character herself (she's quirky, shy, not afraid to speak her mind), and the story so far.  I like that you can change clothes and get different ones depending in the seasons. And this is where I found my first game-breaking glitch: I had 2 Winter pieces, but didn't have enough money to get Winter footwear. I thought this was no problem, since by the time I got some money I'd get it. But then the game forces me to get into my Winter clothing and I'm basically stuck in the clothing choice panel (and no way of going back but to start a new game, since I didn't save prior to that...)

One of the hardest routes that I am in the process in trying to complete now is trying to get the model (hehe) to date me. It's hard, because of how you have to get the money to buy the gifts he want's ect. Then the fact that you didn't know about the e-mail's unless you check them constantly. I wish that you would do some sort of notification thing for the e-mails so it is easier to know if you should check them or not.

After seeing that screenshot, I knew I was going to like the game. I've been looking for something like that and replaying Tokimeki wasn't satisfying me. The art is far better and the MC is very adorable.

She actually has a job and is good at it.\n\nIf any of you played Tokimeki, you'd definitely enjoy this. If you don't like status-raising type of VN then you probably won't like it.

She had distinct personality traits/quirks that were hinted at (or made obvious) at various points in the story rather than being a complete blank or only having those traits appear for certain routes (e.g., she’s got super good aim/excels at shooting games).\n\nI’ve completed each of the main romance routes, two secret routes, and three of the four friendship routes (curse you, John), and I found each one enjoyable. Again, the characters are pretty well fleshed out and each has an interesting story and relatively complex personality. I also appreciate the fact that there are multiple “independent” endings you can achieve that still feel like successes rather than a “boohoo, I’m still sad and single” ending. I also like that you can continue interacting with all of the characters even after committing to a particular route rather than cutting off everyone but the main person.\n\nI’ve seen some people complain about the stats building and/or the overall game being too hard. While I agree that there are some parts that got a little frustrating (the friendship routes in particular), I don’t think it’s overly difficult. For this game, it’s just a matter of figuring out how things work, who prefers what, and focusing on the ending you want. Then again, I like a little more strategy and challenge than a lot of these types of games typically offer.\n\nWould I like to see a few things done differently? Sure (a dialogue option for John similar to Adam’s aquarium one, Rachel route, some stats related activities for the weekends…). But overall, I think the story is solid, the characters are interesting and likeable, and the general gameplay is both challenging and fun. With all of those endings, I think it’s got enough replayability (especially after the final version with voices gets updated) make it worth the $.","June 7, 2015","true","66.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's very little room for error and I had to restart A LOT  to get the good endings. I don't mind stat raising, but this one is a bit tough without a walkthrough.\n\nLike I said, for $30 you're not getting much right now. No voices.

It also has a few bugs, like when I went to load a game, sometimes the game would crash but all I had to do was start the game up again and it would work just fine. Those are the only real problems that would prevent someone from playing the game. As for the game itself, I love being able to change Sian's (pronounced 'Shawn' not 'Seeane' like I originally thought) clothes though I hope the final game will have some more options for clothing and that some of the outfits will be a little cuter (I have a thing about ankle length skirts and this game has a few of them and it kind of bothers me but that's just nitpicking).\nThe only other thing that bothered me was the stories in the routes because I mostly found them a little boring and hope that there might be a little more drama or background information to keep people hooked in the final game. But it is still A LOT of fun and since it's still in development, the final game looks like it'll be a lot of fun. Well, I've gone on sounding like a pretentious weirdo for long enough so all I can say is, if you like otome games, this one is a fun one to play and to also check out SakeVisual for other games they've made because they are pretty fun and a lot of them are free (though only a few of them are otome games)","March 17","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is definitely difficult to find good ones on the market that are in english. This one is unique in that even the voices are english, and lets not forget the fact that the voices are all very attractive and well picked at least in my opinion.\n\nThe music and the art is beautiful. Additionally there was a very well thought out cast, each with unique personalities and reasons to draw your attention. The game is different enough not to feel too repeditive when you are doing the different routes though there are some similarities. I adored collecting all the CGs for my gallery and while I'm no where near completing all the routes I will continue to work towards doing so.\n\nI found the idea of leveling of stats a little difficult because I havent played a game like this with that kind of function before but it wasn't that difficult.

It's nice to see a 'dating' sim where romance isn't the only option. You can take friendship routes with each of the main love interests (weirdly you can't be 'friends' with more than one per playthrough).\nYou can also go independant, which, unusually for a dating sim, is not a lose condition. The 'worst' ending of the game is being expelled, and that's hard to get wihtout actively trying.\nIt IS hard to get any specific ending, getting the 'good' endings is really hard work, requiring high stats, and correct choices throughout. More than once I thought I'd done everything right, only to find I'd missed a key choice or stat, and had a very mediocre ending.\nThe game also contains a saphic love interest (always nice to see!) and a 'romance' path with an aesexual character (nice to see ace people represented in games).\n\nIn short I loved this game, and have sunk a LOT of hours into it. It's still being devloped, so at the moment there are a few bugs, but even so it is very enjoyable.","March 30","true","31.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which unfortunately not a lot of people play this game it seems so only a handful are dedicated to writing out guides. I still wish the game was longer but it is possible to jam pack all the grinding into a single year. With some routes though you have to have days almost exact with what you do otherwise you won't get their best romance route. It IS a grinding game, however they do try to throw in a few cutscenes every time you do specific tasks or go out with people so it's not too monotonous.\nPros:\n-It has a good story line.\n-I haven't, in my experience, played a dress up otome game like it.\n-There are a good number of characters to hang out with and choose from to date.\n-There are cute friend routes and romance routes.\n-Even though there hasn't been an update in a while on here they ARE updating their Facebook page. And they are finding voice actors/actresses and slowly progressing the game. It's just slow.\nCons:\n-The main character is the normal shy type/anxiety prone.\n-The game clearly isn't finished. Overlooking the voice actors and such it leaves a bit to be desired. I personally think it should have been extended to four years instead of just one.\n-It is not worth the price it's listed at. There isn't enough content to be set to that price but they are certainly going in the right direction.\n-There aren't enough outfits and the outfits are set to specific seasons. In order to be a dress up type game I think there should be wayyyy more outfit options. Also there are some sweater tops that can't be worn in the Winter which just doesn't make sense to me. Or the same for some Spring tank tops in Summer.\n\nAll in all I like the idea, and the game but it definitely needs to be finished.","December 22, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many of the otome games I've started have barely been touched because I became bored too quickly with characters or story but not with this one even though it does start out slow.\nThough the romance is a bit too innocent for my liking I found myself smiling through multiple routes and even laughing out loud during a couple scenes. I think that the voice overs have a lot to do with that since it adds to the characters personality ( Love, love Johns voice and John and Lloyds interactions are so fun to listen to).\nThe art is great and the characters all have their own special personality and quirks that makes them worth multiple playthroughs. After playing it I think it would be worth the full price but I waited for it to go on sale. Totally worth the sales price for sure.\nBecause there are so many options I would recommend a hints page for those that don't want to waste tons of time trying to get on a specific route or finding the more elusive routes. Each character has an affinity for different outfits, movies, cupcakes, gifts and lunches as well as specific stat builds. For those that like to go no hints, more power to you. It's fun either way.\n\nPros (for me)\nArt is great.\nVoices are awesome! Really adds to the personalities. I mean REALLY.\nNice story lengths.\n16 endings. (romance/friendship and extra side routes)\nEasily replayable.\nGood bit of humor.\nLots of unlockable achievments through steam.\n\nCons (for me)\nCan't romance Llyod.  I want Lloyds romance route!!!!!  Make him bi and send him my way!\nIt does take a while before you can start making choices.\nRomance is a bit too innocent for me. Would like it a little more mature..they are in college for cripes sake.\nThere are a few places that don't sync up with voice over but hardly worth mentioning.\nHaving a hard time getting friends route endings.\nCan't romance Lloyd...did I mention that already?\nSometimes the stats part can get a bit stale.","February 17","true","66.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
