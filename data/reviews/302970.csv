The soundtrack is a mix of catchy space and lounge tracks and the graphics are beautiful coloured 2D animations.\n\nPlayed a lot of Tower Defense games which were simple windowed *.exe files (Grassland TD) or more complexe ones (Revenge of the Titans) but this here is my absolute favorite TD game.\n\nBy spending the five bucks, you will get a game without a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in-game store (Yes, I look at you Ubisoft!).\nI prefer games, where you can pay a price and get everything in it, instead of trying to win by paying cash\n\nGood move, Hexage!

Yes, it's a bit difficult but that's part of what makes it so fun. When you figure out what path the aliens should follow, what the best weapons are to slaughter them, and where best to place everything. After  working hard to get a winning combo and you kick some serious alien butt - well, you just feel really satisfied.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baroque/recommended/302970/","Baroque","Baroque as a Joke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baroque/","273 products in account","The difficulty people are talking about is not due to clever design but due to annoying 'features' (bad design). For example you can run a wave once and be unsuccessful, and run it a second time (with the exact same setup) and be successful. It's seemingly random.\n\nIt often depends on the direction your towers are facing when you start a wave, because they take sooo long to turn around and face the enemy.\n\nAnother design flaw is badly tiered difficulty of waves. For example on level 7, waves 1-10 are easy and can be beaten with 3-4 towers. Suddenly waves 11 and 12 are next to impossible, even if you've been saving the max resources per round. Now all of a sudden you need 6-7 towers just to barely scrape by. There was no preparation for this. Another example is often when you do scrape by those difficult waves, the next 8-10 waves will be super easy enemies that you faced earlier in the level. It jsut doesn't make sense.\n\nThe dificulty doesn't ramp up like it should: easy medium hard insane. Instead it spikes randomly in waves: easy easy easy HARD easy easy INSANE, etc.\n\nLike other people said the controls are clunky. It's not a problem during the setup rounds between waves, but mid wave it's harder than it should be to set up a tower.\n\nThere's no backspace function like in Defense Grid. You cannot 'Undo' tower placements without selling them for a loss. 1 mistake can cost you the mission and you have to restart, making it very difficult to optimize your bases. This gets frustrating since the levels are SO long (45 waves at level 7).\n\nNote to the designers: Do 10 waves WELL, instead of 45 waves SLOPPILY. It's just annoying how many hours it can take to finish 1 mission after you do get it on lockdown.\n\nAnother problem is enemies can walk off the screen, so you can't even see them. The map does not scroll.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the difficulty of the game is due to Design Flaws and Not clever design. I cannot recommend this game.","August 7, 2014","false","8.9"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","24","40","0","2"

This is a great tower defense and it's great that it's on PC and it's great that it's so damn cheap!  Just know before you buy that it's a pretty bare bones port.  From my limited experience with the android version the PC version is identical, which is fine.  I'm not gonna complain, it's five ♥♥♥♥ing dollars!\n\nIt's just that the interface ends up feeling a little awkward.  You have to do a lot of clicking.  The most annoying result of the port being that in order to figure out what a tower was I had to click it first.  Right click to return or cancel would have been a nice addition, but instead you have to click a cancel button.  Or click a build button, then click where you want it, then click again, then click your heels together.  Just a hell of a lot of left clicking, you understand?  No right mouse, no keyboard shortcuts, no graphics options, in fact the options menu if i remember correctly just has volume sliders.\n\nBut what do you want?  It's radiant defense and it's five bucks.  Go buy it, it's worth it.  Just don't be disappointed by how tablet-ey it feels.  It's worth it still.","July 12, 2014","true","4.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I've played loads of Tower games that provided a challenge but were beatable with a quick re-think of my strategy for that particular wave of enermies. With this game, it feels like if you don't start putting down the perfect sequence of towers from Wave 1, you're doomed to fail by mid-level, and the wave reset won't help because you won't have enough resources to build what you need to. Everything else about the game, i.e. music, graphics, choice of towers etc is great.\n\nI'm all for a challenge but this is just frustrating, and I gave up.","January 22","false","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I think the game is good.\n\n(optional let's play footage - coming soon)\nhttp://youtu.be/hihHmhhnrmU\nI think graphical quality is good. I like the music and the sound effects.\n\nIt's a tower defense game. If you have a played a lot of these types of games before I wouldn't say that it really innovates. But so far I think a pretty good implementation of this type. It has few useful features. For example if built something in the wrong place you can get a full refund if you sell it straight away and you also speed up time during the waves, so that the game isn't so slow. You seem to have good variety of turrets to build. Some require you to have a tech structure first. I noticed that there seems to be only 15 levels, I'm not about that though.\n\nThe game is easy to get the hang of the basics such as turret placement. You need to get to know the characteristics of the different types of turrets. Obviously some ordinances are more effective against certain types and amounts of enemies. However rotation speed of the turrets also comes play, some are very fast while are so slow enemies can get past them.\n\nI like this game. I like trying to find the best turret placement, combination of turrets etc. It was fun. But if the game only has 15 levels it may be relatively short. However later levels should be increasingly difficult and have more waves.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","July 11, 2014","true","1.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

At the end of each wave interest is applied to the total amount of money you have left. This leads to many instances where you think you are doing ok but then you hit a brick wall. The only way of progressing is to start again and make sure you don't overspend too early. This creates a unique challenge where you have to very carefully monitor whether you need to spend the money or not. I spent several days, and hundreds of attempts on some levels to get them finished. Mastering the interest mechanism is absolutely critical to completing some of the more challenging levels, and it is clear that the developers must have spent an age play testing it.\n\nSuperb","August 6, 2014","true","73.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If I were giving it a grade on a scale from 1-10, I'd give it a solid 7.  It doesn't do anything genre-defining like Orcs Must Die or Kingdom Rush, but it does put the standard tower defense pieces together well to create a challenging experience.\n\nIf you research this game for more than 30 seconds, you'll see that people complain/rave that it is very difficult.  It is definately a very challenging tower defense game, easily one of the hardest I have played.  Unfortunately, the difficulty often comes as a result of poor wave balancing.  The difficulty really gives very low margin for error, causing you to not experiment too much in the obvious formula to success.\n\nAlso, unlike a lot of the best tower defense games, there's really no tower-progression or leveling up through the campaign - you have access to all of the towers right away.  This creates somewhat of a rinse-repeat feeling by halfway through the game that never goes away as nothing very new presents itself throughout the entire game except stronger and stronger waves.\n\nI would definitely recommend it to genre fans like me looking for yet another Tower defense game to play.  For all others, I'd suggest first knocking out genre classics like Orcs Must Die, Dungeon Defenders, Kingdom Rush, and Bloons TD before spending your time on this title.","September 22, 2014","true","23.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
