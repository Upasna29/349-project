It's an RTS (Real Time Strategy) with a fast pace and fair, competitive action. You can choose between PvP, Coop/PvE/Solo (vs AI), Survival, or CTF (Capture the Flag) game modes. AirMech was inspired by a classic Sega Genesis game called Herzog Zwei. The game is still in beta (ETA: Summer 2014) so bugs are still being fixed and features are being added.\n\nThere is no pay2win involved in AirMech. You can't buy any advantage for gameplay. Everything they sell is cosmetics and collectables. This keeps the game fair and balanced for everyone. Once you've learned the game, you have just as good of a chance at winning as every other player.\n\nAirMech is developed by CarbonGames, an indie developer with a team of about 10. With no major publisher, they're free to do what they want with the game. They're very active with the community and join us in the chat often for questions, suggestions, and other feedback.\n\nIf you like Action-RTS, come check it out for free. If you need help, ask us in the chat. My name is InsaneFirebat and I'd be happy answer any questions you have.","October 22, 2013","true","755.8"," 274 of 309 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","274","309","3","22"

I've played it since 2011. I met the developers at PAX when they only had a tiny corner in someone else's booth. I was so excited when new patches came out and I bought all sorts of silly flair because I loved supporting the developers of such a great game. Over the past year or so things have taken an odd turn. Entire new ranges of unnecessary and overpriced sub-items are available that modify your mechs. Now they have de-powered the silly just-for-fun mechs as some kind of cash grab and made the parts available to play in PVP, this looks an awful lot like pay to win. This makes me sad.\n\nThere is also the continuous state of beta that makes little sense. The developers announced they were less than a month from being done with beta 2 years ago. No one has any idea what the roadmap for this game is, but as it stands the developers feel they can change core mechanics on paid-for items at will. I will not be spending any more money on this game if that is the lack of respect I can expect from Carbon.\n\nI may not be some Youtuber but I promoted this game to my friends and clan with vigor over the past 4 years. That also stops now. I can no longer, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone.","September 24, 2015","false","712.3"," 256 of 289 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","256","289","9","12"

Following a power war that destroyed nearly all global infrastructure, society has collapsed and a tiny fraction of humanity survives. The most skilled of them pilot the transforming vessels that caused this war, the AirMechs. These hybrids of planes and mechs are capable of causing destruction unparalleled by any other combat vehicle and then transforming to escape, pickup reinforcements, order a few light vehicles to attack, and return to continue the mayhem.\n\nThe basic gameplay of AirMech revolves around using one of nine different transforming mechs to carry around and order eight types of units that the player has taken into battle to capture outposts which serve as deploy points for new units and refuel stations for your airmech, as well as increasing the amount of units that you can field at a time and increasing the rate at which the credits used to purchase units are accumulated. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the enemy fortress while of course preventing the destruction of your own.\n\nAirMech has been called a MOBA, but I think it far more accurate to think of AirMech as an RTS where your cursor can itself damage and be damaged by enemy units. This mechanic allows in AirMech for gameplay and strategy to occur that is not found in any other game. Destroy the enemy airmech, and they'll be unable to route reinforcements to the outpost that you're attacking until they get back in. You'll be able to stage a surprise assault elsewhere that they won't be able to deal with until they respawn. Destroying the enemy airmech greatly expands your tactical options and adds a new layer of strategy to RTS.\n\nThere are nine AirMechs in the game. The Striker is an all around mech good at most tasks but inferior in almost all of them to some more specialized mech. The Helix is slow but great for ferrying units around and forcing enemy AirMechs to GTFO. The Bomber is great for killing clumped units like that jackal rush some hunk of cheese is throwing at you, while the Warthog specializes at taking down high health units one unit at a time and surviving long enough to do it. The Saucer is a versatile yet paper thin mech that can destroy large number of enemy units using its death ray or exploit a negligible amount of anti-air and turn the enemy armies to your side. The Osprey specializes in healing your units and is great for defending outposts that are under attack. The Neo is used to stage ambushes using its cloaking abilities and can slow enemy movement and prevent enemy mechs from escaping using its stasis blast. The Paladin is used to strength unit clusters using its attack, defense, and speed auras. Lastly, the Angel is used to snipe enemy units from a distance and then escape before you can be destroyed.\n\nThere are nearly 70 types of units in the game, ranging from infantry, the only unit type that can capture and occupy outposts, to light vehicles useful for fast assaults on enemy outposts and a variety of cheese strats revolving around massing a couple dozen of them and sending them all to destroy the enemy fortress, to tanks, the mainstays of your armies, to anti-air built for the express purpose of destroying the enemy airmech, to healing units for all of you turtles, to a variety of turrets (most of which aren't useless, especially the T45... don't use it, even though you'll feel like it, it's bad, just save yourself some grief, resist the temptation and don't do it, whatever you do don't do it!). Also in the mix are bombs that your airmechs can drop on the enemy units, mines, and artillery to deal with those pesky turtles. The game also features roughly 30 different pilots to provide large stat boosts to your airmech in exchange for some downside along with a host of items and parts, which provide smaller boosts to your airmech. This host of combinations of mechs, units, pilots, parts, and items allows you to play almost any way you feel like. I don't think that there's a play style that isn't supported in AirMech, the possibilities you have are virtually endless.\n\nSome might worry about AirMech being a pay to win game. These worries are not entirely unjustified given how many other games have gone down this path. AirMech, however, stays clear of it, employing the best free to play model I have yet seen in any game. The premium currency, diamonds, can only be used to purchase cosmetics, kudos, XP, and drop boosts, things on the player market, and ultimate items that cannot be used in PvP. Everything that affects the PvP game can only be purchased with kudos, excepting items that player put up on the player market. A 10 minute match will earn you roughly 150 kudos, and most things in the game cost anywhere from 500 to around 3600 kudos. The grind in the game is thus very light, almost non-existent compared to most other "Non Pay to Win" games out there such as League of Legends or Warframe. Don't want the grind? Purchase AirMech Prime for $20 USD, which will unlock every unit and AirMech in the game, refunding you kudos on anything that you already owned. Purchasing diamonds in AirMech also gives you more value comparatively than in app purchases in other games, with $5 giving you enough to buy 1-3 skins, depending on the skins, and $10 being enough to buy 4-11 skins, once again depending on the skins. Try seeing how much you can get from that much in LoL... I can tell you that it will be quite a bit less.\n\nThe community in AirMech is arguably the best in online gaming. Our global chat is full of people eager to answer questions, and it is rare to go half an hour without someone doing a giveaway known as a diamond roll, where someone spends 500 diamonds (Around a dollar in value) to start a diamond giveaway, where one random entrant will receive 360 diamonds and another 60. Recently the developers have implemented Black Diamond Rolls, which cost 5000 diamonds (around $10) and multiply the amount of recipients of diamonds by 10 compared to a normal roll. This variety too is surprisingly common. On what other game will people spend $10 to give away stuff to random players of the game? The AirMech community is simply amazing.\n\nWhat truly makes AirMech the greatness that it is is the developers. Carbon, a small studio of nine devs have worked tirelessly on AirMech for 3 and a half years. Their dedication is simply amazing, from working on Christmas Eve to get a patch out to hanging out in chat to answer player's questions to crafting the game to be free to play even though a pay to win game would likely have gotten them much more money. These developers work harder than just about any other developer you'll find and have done everything to make a fair game where you could spend a day grinding and be able to create a competitive loadout, where it doesn't matter in pvp if you've spent $5, or $140, or $600, or $0. Fostering the creation of a community where every day dozens of dollars are given away to random people through diamond rolls. Carbon is one of those few developers, and AirMech one of those few games where you can spend over a hundred and forty USD and not feel bad, for with AirMech Carbon has earned it. Few developers have put so much effort into creating such a fair gameplay experience, and a fun one, and few games have communities as friendly, helpful, and generous as that of AirMech. To say that AirMech is a game which you will probably have fun playing and which you could probably justify shelling out $5 for is like saying that if you want to live it's probably a good idea to breathe. AirMech is an experience like no other with devs virtually unparalleled in dedication. I wholeheartedly recommend it, and encourage you to help carbon out by buying a thousand diamonds or two, not because it's necessary, but because Carbon has deserved it with the experience that they've crafted.\n\nAirMech is simply a masterpiece.","December 29, 2014","true","722.0"," 94 of 112 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","94","112","15","6"

The reviews that say this game is Pay to Win is laughable at best, and lazy in it's truth.   The game is kudos based (given for playing the game, win or lose)  All units (even the big cool ones...), parts, most pilots and items are able to be purchased with Kudos.   The premium currency is diamonds, which are only for cosmetics.  period.  Thats it. And there are even survey's to get free diamonds without spending a dime.\n\nThe gameplay has undergone several revises since its Alpha inception.   The Matchmaking has been redone to help people in lower populated areas find games.  The matchmaking servers rememeber your "lag" or lack of connectivity to specific servers, and removes them from your server list if they get to be unplayable.  There are multiple modes to play, solo, coop, pvp, survival, challenge.  You can replay this game a lot. And while there are some wait times, they pale in comparison to games like League of Legends, with 1 hour queue times for a game.\n\nThe game that is free to play allows the basic gameplay without "VIP" access.  Basically, allows you all the things VIP gets, with the exception of diamonds.  And even then VIP is only $5 to get if you choose it.  The basic gameplay doesnt hold back any content,  without VIP however, and you can still experience a very good game.\n\nAll in all, the game is worth it in my opinion.  It has been around for 2+ years, just got a contract with Ubisoft to release the Xbox version of it, and is growing.  Worth the time if you like RTS/MOBA style games.\n\n\n\n","October 26, 2014","true","969.7"," 78 of 97 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","78","97","0","0"

It was a great game, fun to play solo or coop, not so much multiplayer because queue times are horrendous, and you get flattened by a. smurfs or b. the main accounts, which i got matched up with anyways because there aren't enough people playing.\n\nThen the developers decided, ♥♥♥♥ it, lets nerf all these things that you had to pay premium currency for, change the deployment scheme, rack up the tax % in the market for EVERYONE by 2%, plus non-VIP (non paid) players were allowed to participate in the market, but with a massive 35% tax rate and no way to lower it. In addition, the "tax books" used to lower the tax are so rare, you basically have to buy them with premium currency from someone else who had them drop. Having said that, if you spent 3500 diamonds on two tax books, that would lower your tax 2%, only to have it go right back to what it was. In addition, hoarders exist, making it very hard to get a deal like that for basically anything good. In addition, the devs don't listen to those who disagree-they claim they listen to the silent majority, not just those who post in their forums, yet the silent majority would be those who play solo/coop, and the devs nerfed the units that the solo/coop farmers use. Now, these "ultimate" units costing around 600 diamonds each are basically the same as their base versions. And on the forums, the lead developer, james, changed a topic from the changes to the game to talking about a minigame while on the loading screen. Really? Instead of facing any problems, the devs just walk away from it. And that's not even all the problems. Putting in a mandatory purchase to use the chat when you didn't have to, a better looking ui for the pvp screen but not matching it up with the solo/coop screens, these seem like distractions to mask the issues beneath. They recently changed the stats of every single pilot, saying that this was to make the game more fair. Very disappointing for a game that I had high hopes for.","December 19, 2015","false","501.6"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","57","68","0","2"

Now I'm back with 2 years worth of experience (note, that I play this game off of Steam.) And within those two years I have seen this game throw itself in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nAirmech at first was a good game, it showed promise and had a chance to transform into something unique. But after some "balancing" updates and this Farmville ♥♥♥♥ they placed in the main menu, I have completely lost faith in Carbon's abilities to finish the job they have started.\nThey are literally holding the chat hostage until you buy shovels to dig a hole in the ground to build a ♥♥♥♥ing radio tower.

We bought tons of cosmetics to support them and ensure that the game would exit Early Access.

Worthless cosmetics and less updates? I've seen modders do more within a week than this joke.

There has been a mass exodus of this game by its players because of this.  Also the game is almost unplayable at this point as i and everyone else have been crashing out at least 75% of the time.  I will say that in this games glory days it was the best game on the market with a strong support system.  Strong online community and incredible fast paced, strategic gameplay.

Carbon has added a rather low ping limit which limits high ping players strictly to solo play, you can not even have a private match with friends.\n\nIf your ping is affected by said ping limit, you will see this every time you log in: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=342205076\n\nFYI I'm based in the US\n\nCarbon devs do not see this as an issue and act as if they do not care. I have been told that no games compensate for ping above 200 and that I should find another game after asking them about issues with ping, long before there was a limit.\n\nAs a Prime player, being told to find a different game by a lead dev after asking a question was off putting but I continued to play because I love the game.\n\nNow in addition to all of the above, there are massive FPS drops that can only be fixed by changing video settings and this fix is only temporary, the drops will start again the next time the game is launched. Even the lobby is affected now, but that goes away once chat is hidden.\n\nI have to lower my antialiasing to 0 and then bring it back up to 4 to stop the drops. Originally the devs blamed it on a bug with certain unit skeletons, and it has not been fixed. This began when Carbon started preparing AirMech for its Xbox 360 release and changed every UI in the game. Mind you my computer is above recomended requirements.\n\nAfter all that has happened, my love for the game is wearing thin. I find myself not logging in to have fun but out of habbit to collect daily rewards. I can no longer play with my friends because Carbon has deemed the internet in my area unworthy.","November 15, 2014","false","223.5"," 97 of 145 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","97","145","6","7"

Thats because this game becomes devastatingly hard when your ping reaches 300 and above. Other than that, you can still enjoy the game by playing the solo vs, solo survival, coop with friends close to your area, etc. which almost covers up the whole lag issues. But still, I'm waiting for those issues to be fixed, because this game only becomes very playable when you dont experience lag during your game. Ofc you wouldn't want to see your team losing just because of lag right?\n\nRegarding the market, this game is quite a true f2p game and not pay2win. Why? It's because, so far I haven't encountered any pay2win aspects that make me want to give up on this game. I'll give one example (based on fact), there's no airmechs in this game that you can't buy using in game money, even if there are mechs that you have to buy using diamonds (you'll know it later on), they are just skins based from the original airmechs. Ofc with skins your mechs would look better in the battlefield, but only having the original mechs wouldn't hurt right? SO you have to work for it if you want to buy them using diamonds! Also, there's this feature when everytime your referral (if someone would volunteer to become your referral) levels up to rounded numbers like 10, 20, 30, etc. you will get diamonds for free, and the amount always accumulates everytime your referral level reaches the next rounded number. This game already helps you with that, your job is only to work hard. Every people get what they deserved.\n\nP.S.

Sounds familiar? Not surprised. But this time around, there is only very little of these, so you are instead of fighting the enemy head-on ordered to lead a sizable army in such a way you'll manage to destroy the enemy fortress while keeping the one you own alive, capturing outposts along the way to get more and more advantages.\n\nNothing too original there, as you may see. What truly matters is the combat system and equipment system - because that's the REAL fun here.\n\nThe combat system seems basic at first, but gets more complex later. Your AirMech is the equivalent of a typical MOBA hero - Has a main attack, runs around, gets XP and upgrades to get abilities. However, it's not only that, but also a RTS general unit and a fighter jet. Pressing space at any time will, if you have enough energy, jump you into fighter mode. That way you can't attack ground units (exception to the Warthog's praised ability) and can't be attacked by them if AA isn't their base ability, but can attack AirMechs in their jet mode. And vice versa, of course. The air mode also allows you to pick up friendly units, either from the ground or from any of your outposts if you build them yourselves, and drop them elsewhere. You can even give orders to them that way - except for most infantry units. These guys are just too dumb.\n\nBut that isn't all. In your typical MOBA, you also have creeps, right? Well no worries, these guys are here as well. The thing is: They aren't the main non-player combat force; Your own troops are.\n\nEach player has eight slots for units he/she uses on the battlefield. There's quite a range of them, from infantry and tanks to APC's, AA tanks and Buildings. Each unit is highly different from others, which changes its role on the field, be it the capability to direct other troops, drop infantry on death, repair or even suicide in order to explode. I highly recommend taking a look at that store - a proper unit setup can do quite a lot. Alongside with that, there are buildings to be used as well - usually increasing either your unit capacity or giving you money to buy these units with over time. And turrets, don't forget about turrets.\n\nEvery building can then be placed on a socket, which is exactly what it sounds like - a socket. In some cases, it only provides bonuses to have your building on a socket, in other cases it's a requirement to place them there. Units, on the other side, have the ability to interact with outpost, where infantry can get up on them and capture them while machinery can be placed on doorsteps in order to block off entrances. You can also pick things up and repair and rearm them above outposts as well as you can repair and rearm your own AirMech there. Last but not least, outposts provide another exit point for your production queue.\n\nNow, maps in this game are very little of, but their quality is undoubtable. They provide both linear advances and chokepoints and flanking possibilities, coupled with the placement of neutral units all over the place. I still managed to find a couple faults in the designation of spawn areas, though, but these are small things.\n\nThere are several gamemodes right now  - 2v2, 3v3, Coop 2v2/3v3, CTF-style gamemode and Survival. But the devs are not done yet - planned SP campaign is not a bad idea. However, there are some server problems here and there - the 2v2 and  3v3 multiplayers have a lack of servers. Devs solved the problem by enabling only one at a time, which might come as bit unconvenient, but I guess it's okay as the game is still technically in Early acces.\n\nBut more amazing features are waiting for you outside of battling - the game has a decent community system with rankings, levels, clans, chat badges and even in-game player market much similar to the one Steam has, except you pay only in  Diamonds - a premium currency. As well as that there are drops you can find after matches - special versions of units with some basic changes - some sacrifice armor to get speed, others get more health but lower speed etc. All this can be sold on the market so you can get more diamonds yourslef - which you can then use to buy something else even outside the market, regardless of whether you ever bought anything for the game. Also, there are private trades available - so you can always give something you don't need or use to friends. Found that feature very convenient.\n\nThe other currency is Kudos - all the important stuff can be bought for that. However, you will not be able to buy cosmetics or ultimate units - a version of certain 'meta' units and buildings with very little downsides and extreme upsides. Or ultimate pilots - same deal there.\n\nAnother thing is the equipment system. Players can have several loadouts, each with a different AirMech class, unit composition, pilot, special parts and improvements and cosmetics, upon which you can count stuff like team color, pets, flails and even AirMech skins. There are only few of the AirMech types, but each is very unique and features a different set of abilties as well as a different set of available equipment parts. The parts use a level system - you have a certain part capacity you can use to give your AirMech more specializated capabilities, which increases as you level up. Of course, the more drastic the effect of the part is, the more drastic is the part capacity and price going to be. Pilots are then another way to specialize your AirMech - they, however, affect more than just your AirMech.\n\nIn conclusion, here's another F2P game worth giving a shot. It's not going to be any kind of revolutionary craziness, but it's rock solid and won't let you down on what it promises to bring.","October 28, 2014","true","19.9"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","29","37","0","0"

Even in the lobby chat the words were blocky and straining to the eyes. BUT.. then I found the settings and switched to full screen with 1080p resolution and everything looked smooth and normal as it should be. I actually went through the starting tutorial with pixelated graphics but it seems the default settings need to be changed right away for a normal viewing experience.\n\nSo each match you play (Solo, Co-Op, PvP) you choose a Mech to be your on field commander that can build units, collect and drop them on the map, research upgrades for your mech (each has different abilities) and fight the enemy in the air or transform and fight on land. The objective is to capture the outposts with creeps so you can gain territory and build more offensive and defensive units and in the end, destroy the enemy fortress with your units. I can't say the idea is original since I've played a game with a mode like this since the 1st generation Playstation days. However the different Mechs and playstyles is interesting and you need to be fast to control the situation.\n\nFor each Mech you also need a pilot character which has different bonuses but also negatives for your setup. For example a higher defense bonus might give you a cost to Air Speed (Mech flying speed). These bonuses and negatives apply through the items you can equip to your Mech as well. You can play and earn favor to buy units, pilots, items from the shop. Some items are only purchasable with gems in which you can get by some quests you complete, dice rolls that other players can offer on chat to win gems with highest and lowest number.. or paying for it. After each match it shows you how much more you could've earned in favor and experience if you were a VIP member, which might get annoying. Some diamonds from quests you couldn't unlock unless you're a VIP member.\n\nWhen there's lag in a Co-op/PvP match it could get annoying as it's very noticeable. Your Mech stops.. then moves... then might stop... then move. But the experience will of course vary depending on location, ping, connection, etc. It's fun and satisfying when you're fighting the enemy Mech in the air and watching them explode when you finish them off. I'm not sure if solo play is really time limited or just means you'll stop gaining XP and Favor after a certain amount of solo play unless you have VIP. It's an interesting game to play at first but there might be some repetition and grinding involved. Nice to try out but sticking around depends on the player. I haven't really been playing though..","November 29, 2014","true","17.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

It's an RTS  where the strategist also participates in the fight.   I've played > 200 hrs so far....\n\nI think this game uses good ideas for additional strategy in the loadout decison process.\nBeing able to make choices of weapons or upgrades, with varying benefits and costs, adds to the game.  But I also think that the developers attempt to balance upgrades with negtive affects is too sucessful.  It seems that there is nearly as much to lose in every upgrade as there is to gain.  It almost  negates reasons to upgrade.  C'mon, you can offer highly desireable upgrades that don't have a sucky side to them and make us work really hard to get them, or pay if we are willing.  Give us something really worth fighting for :-)\n\nThere are a couple of  bugs that I have noticed.  The first is a strange yellow arrow that suddenly  appears surrounding one of the pads at a controlled base.  This causes your spawing units to not appear at the top tof the base but at the pad.  Since there is no documentation regarding this, I assume that it is a feature intended for a future release.  Once it appears this seriously disrupts gameplay and there is no way to get rid of it except to quit the match and restart.   Similarly, a persistent green  'patrol route' guide sometimes appears on it's own near a base and stays there for the duration of the match, annoying and distracting but harmless.\n\n[Update Mar 4 2015: I found  the yellow arrow around  the pad can be turned off pushing down the right joystickon a gamepad, probably how it gets accidentally turned on.  Don't know which key to press for those not using the gamepad.  Again, I've yet to find any documentation for this behavior.]\n\nThe second bug is a sudden and rapid drop in framerate.  I have a machine and graphics card far above what this game requires, by multiples.  Yet sometimes after playing for a while, the framerate drops severely and the game is rendered unplayable until you restart.  That's no exageration, we are talking 2-3 fps [Update Mar 4 2015: I have not seen this in quite a while, may have been fixed,]\n\nNeither issue is frequent, only occasional.  I expect they will be worked out in time.\n\nRegardless; With the starter pack, this is a bargain and then some. It might be DOTA like, but this kicks DOTA's butt for sheer intensity.","December 30, 2014","true","352.8"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","0"

There are also a wide variety of airmechs, pilots and parts, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, and there is a very large amount of customization in this game, which I love.\n\nI spend a lot of time playing this game now, and it's quite addicting, if you get this game, I would highly reccomend getting the starter kit for 10$ to get the full experience, but you should play the game a bit for yourself first to see if you yourself really like this game, because this game also does not push you into buying the premium version (Silver VIP), for example, when you have premium, you get diamonds (Cash currency) for getting cetain achievments, but if you get Silver VIP, any diamonds from achievments you would have obtained before you got Silver VIP will be stockpiled up, and you can collect all of them after getting Silver VIP. Probably one of the best parts about the starter kit is that you get enough diamonds to buy practically anything you want which is great.\n\nOverall this is a very fun and interesting strategy game, and I would highly reccomend playing it.\n\nAfter reading through this, I've realized that it almost sounds like I was payed to write this review, but I wasn't, it's just that good, Carbon Games is a great company, thank you very much for making this great game, and not being stingy with the pricing either!\n\n9/10","January 17, 2015","true","81.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","0"

I will start with the most important and that is the poor servers.\nAlthough in major countries there are playable servers available, for any other country, even sometimes to players in major countries, you get placed on a far-away, entirely irrelevant and weak server. Game after game after game is unplayable because an australian player hosts a game and it picks the korean server. Germany or South African player and you get plonked onto an unplayable Tunisian server. Don't even bother, if you are lucky to play online games where broken matchmaking (which gets worse each "patch") doesn't kill your game, you will get bored as heck- read on why.\n\nSo you joined the game, you just passed level 10 and you can't join a single game- what gives? Well, too bad, you missed the first wave of beta players boat and they don't give a heck about you. The active players play exclusively with each other and farm with each other. New players get to play with new players forever, but eventually they all quit as there is no incentive to play, which brings me to the following:\n\nLevelling up in this game is utterly pointless. You earn a few locked diamonds (you have to spend real money to unlock them) at level intervals but levelling up is so boring, tedious, mediocre and repetetive that you either realise what a waste of time playing this game is, or you slave away, losing your soul game by slaving game, until you reach level 25 and hate yourself for trying, because active players buy their way to level 100+ with real money bought boosts and exclusive groupies.\n\nThis game is fun until level 5-10ish. After that, it becomes stupendously mediocre and repetetive.\nThe only new and temporarily interesting content in the game is bought with real money through the in game currency (diamonds). You can earn some of this currency in-game, but it will be locked and unusable until you spend real money to unlock it. These items bought with diamonds are purely cosmetic- so after unlocking several cosmetic items, you realize what a total waste that was as there is no benefit to having more than 6 cosmetic items as you can only equip 2 sets of 3 items at a time.\n\nNew content added to the game that can be unlocked using in game money (kudos) are all the same. Roughly once a month 1 to 3 new items are added but these items are identical to existing items (that you likely already own) and only differ in icon-appearance. New items are therefore always redundant, pointless and useless.\n\nI feel I have warned you enough by now, and if you ignore my warning and play this game and realise you should've listened, servers you right. Enjoy hating yourself. I'm getting sick of writing a review about this game, with its uninspiring, lame and unhelpful dev's who only cater for the select few level 100+ players that virtually fund this game by themselves.","September 28, 2014","false","526.7"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","26","38","3","0"

With the player piloting a transformer mech.\n\n\nMost of the stuff can be earned, and what there is to buy with real money is cosmetic, mostly. While the game absolutely does want your money, it doesn't get ugly about it.\n\nGameplay consists of you rushing around the map doing things such as collecting units (heavy units can be given Capture or Kill orders or just dropped to guard), deploying them in position, or battling enemy forces in person. You level up your mech during battle which allows you to build upgrades for youself. In addition you can build and place turrets or artillery pieces, drop mines, bombs or even bear traps. That's before we get into the funky stuff like stealth, healing or straight up stealing enemy units.\n\nGame modes are Solo, Co-op or PvP in 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or Survival modes. While there is an initial learning curve, AirMech is not an extremly complex game. I'm more of a fan of turn based combat but the quick pace of AirMech suits me just fine. Your mileage may wary. You earn one type of currency, the other can be bought with real $$. You spend currency unlocking units to build, mech equipment or buying cosmetics or pets and such. You also get random drops after some battles.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Transformers (not in name/license obviously), free, good!

You choose the assortment of units you will be using for a particular battle with various advantages / disadvantages / costs / tradeoffs / etc...  There are multiple strategies that are viable, so it doesn't seem like there is merely one right path (though there are a few better ones).  Your command unit can similarly by selected for various tradeoffs, and then buffed up and modified with its item configuration.  This is where you may start to bump into the 'Free to Play' nuisance, as paid players will have more and better options to work with.  The premium currency is completely blocked from your usage until you buy some directly, so although it shows that you are earning some over time, you can't actually use any of it until you pay (so it is simply a carrot that grows).  AirMech mostly suffers from a limited player base, probably caused by its vaguely annoying F2P experience.  Its worth trying out, particularly with a friend, but it is unlikely to affix itself to your frequently play roster.","February 2","true","26.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Global chat used to be full of life, almost all the time, now it's even more stagnant than the in-game settings menu. Once-active chat moderators no longer log on as often, allowing way for newer players to take advantage. A reasonable discussion of the game can't go down, as the vast majority of chat occupants are players whom have only recently joined.\n\nPut simply, there isn't enough people to make the game fun. CoOp is  a lagfest, Bots are predictable, and uninteresting to play against, and PvP is dominated by pubstompers who run a virtually uncounterable loadout set. Spamming Hard-to-kill tanks and utilizing a Mech that can overheal thier units faster than any other mech or unit can damage them. The lack of veriety, A larger population would help against immensly, but i'm far too tried of waiting for nothing to happen there. This game was taken off of the list of F2P games by the developers for unknown reasons, making it hidden in a maze of other niche indie games. Unit and Mech balance is a marginally organized mess, with several units being necessary to equip, while others, an inherent detriment to. Ideas regarding the balance of 2v2 or 3v3 balance have been essentially forgone due to the severe lack of people playing in them.\nFocus of the game is around CoOp, the most populated game mode. With unintelectual bots that administer predictable strategies and uninteretsing gameplay (all with might i add, artificial difficulty modifiers) make PvE gamemodes stale and tiresome to play. The same exact strategy is viable for each game, and others are differed and discouraged by the bots' omnipresense and unrestricted loadout access.\n\nBalance discussions and idea suggestions have become extremely stagnant on the official forums, and the Balance council has as much transperency of thier current ideas (if they have any on the table at all) as a concrete bunker. Anything that they're doing they rarely discuss unless directly confronted. All the agreement on an interesting suggestion seems to go nowhere to the point that it seems to be without viable substance to make threads anymore. Long-beloved veterans have withdrawn from the game's community, and it's no coincidence that they have.\nMajor changes to the game's core, particuarlly the Arm system, while I am personally indifferent about it, seems to have driven off several veteran players. The addition of some Cash gimmicks such as parts and Ultimate Units for Unranked PvP give a strong impression of the Pay-to-win style of game that pluages the game market today. While this "pay-to'win" percieved aspect really isn't entierly true, it makes the game much less comforable to open up to, especially by those who dislike the style of game.\nBalance updates are becoming further far inbetween as well.\n\n\n\n\nI'm getting far too tired waiting for something interesting to happen.","May 10","false","936.7"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

For me I like dual stick shooters and real time strategies, so this game felt like a joy to play. Then you throw in, single player, cooperative play and player vs player, there's a lot here for everyone to enjoy. It controls like a dual stick shooter, left stick to move, right stick to shoot. There are mouse controls for those without a 360 controller. Since you are an air mech, you can transform from a jet or helicopter by pressing the left trigger to a giant towering robot. On the ground you're much slower, but you can fight the ground troops with ease. Then if you need to get across the map or fight enemy aircraft, simply transform and fly there. You can buy upgrades during a match, but you'll need to pick them up from one of your bases. Different mechs have different weapons and abilities like a sword or bombs, but without powering up abilities they feel pretty useless compared to guns.\n\nThe object of each game is to take the opposing player's (or bot's) home base. Its just that simple. Like a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). Your home base generates computer controlled fodder troops. These troops will automatically seek out other bases and take them over. So if there is an abandon base on a map, they're sure to find it, but if there's a tank guarding the base, they're sure to die trying to take it.\n\nEach base requires four troops to capture it. These four troops then guard it from turrets on the top. If the enemy's fodder troops come, they'll just be mowed down. They just walk into their doom. Everything gives your mech experience to level up during the match.\n\nWhen you get low on health or low on fuel, just fly back to one of your bases. Each base is somewhat different and has a different amount of healers and refueling devices. The more devices, the faster you'll be healed and refueled. If you run out of fuel, you'll fly slower. Using your shield and extra abilities will drain fuel, but I can't say that I used it that often. You can even pick up a unit, hover over a base and refill the unit's health. If you can't make it back to a base, change to your robot form to slowly refuel. Its a nice system. If you die, you're out of the game for X amount of seconds before you respawn at your home base. You can speed up the time by one second for 2,000 or so credits. Credits are your in match currency.\n\nSince this is a real time strategy, you'll also be building and leading units to victory. You can pick them up, move them around, select them to command where they go. These units along with your upgrades require time to build them. Once they've been built, you pick them up at a local base, and put them on the ground, one at a time. It doesn't matter what base you pick up your units, just that its one of your bases. The units don't heal themselves like you can. Instead you'll have to rely on specific healing units that will recharge health of nearby allies. Each unit requires credits to manufacture them and their upkeep. So if you don't have enough credits to support a large army, you will need to drop a unit into a base to recycle it before you'll be allowed to make a new unit.\n\nBefore you begin, you can chose from your inventory of units to assign them into a nine unit menu. So if you've got two-hundred units to chose from, you can only use nine types per match. These units are soldiers, vehicles, mechs, turret guns, cash generators, mines and so on. Everything that you'd expect from a real time strategy. You can also select your pilot, air mech and equipment for your mech.\n\nThe different pilots each have different pros and cons. The default pilot Hawk has 10% credits, 5% credits earned, 5% unit build speed at the cost of 3% unit damage resistance and 7% air mech attack power. Each pilot has beautiful art work and there's something that fits your play style. You'll even find Youtubers as pilots done in the same beautiful artwork. I guess its a way to thank them for their publicity.\n\nThe game does a great job of introducing you to the game without punching you in the face that there are micro transactions in the way of diamonds. It lets you get completely through the fifteen challenge tutorial. Each challenge is a quick tutorial you'll blow through in no time. There are even star rankings, so you can return for better ratings, but its so simple there's no need to other than experience and gold called kudos.\n\nLeveling up unlocks new parts, pilots, mechs and units that you still need to buy with gold (kudos). Its an easy system like every other gold (kudos) and experience system. To keep things interesting the achievements (quests) in game will also give you a bonus of gold for accomplishing them. Things like destroying ten tanks in a single match. You can even spend diamonds to get gold and experience boosters for those that don't like the grind, but really the grind is the game of chess that AirMech is. Every match feels enjoyable, not just that but every match feels fast paced, unlike other MOBAs that can last usually an hour. I'm no fan of MOBAs, I often get bored long before the match ends. They feel like true grinds, while AirMech is enjoyable because its not truly a MOBA.\n\nThere are different air mechs to buy, either with default gold or if you want something unique you can purchase premium versions.  It doesn't look like there is any difference in statistics between the gold bought air mechs and their premium diamond counter-parts. The only difference is visual. You will look cool when flying your neon gothic helix helicopter or your BlackOps helix helicopter instead of your standard gold bought helix helicopter. Cosmetics are good way of doing micro transactions. However, I can still diamond buy an premium osprey helicopter without being a level 8 to unlock the default osprey helicopter.\n\nYou can gold buy enhancements for your air mech and equip them in the hanger before you go into battle. Each piece of equipment that you put on takes up part points. To keep things balanced each mech only has so many part points. So do you want a fantastic shield or do you want several good upgrades instead? The choice is yours and you can have fun buying and tweaking your mech to your hearts desire.\n\nThere are several play options, solo where you play by yourself in either skirmishes of 1 vs 1, 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, 2 vs 2, 2 vs 3, 3 vs 3 or a survival facing waves of enemies defending your home base. Survival turns into a tower defense game. The three survival maps are built in spirals allowing for multiple access points into the map. You'll need to cover them all if you're going to survive all the way through. You can also redo the challenges and tutorial in solo play.\n\nIn player vs player you and an ally compete in 2 vs 2 matches and this is where it becomes a grind. It is a drastic departure from the fun and joy of playing against even a difficult computer opponent. Humans know what wins a match and how to keep from losing. This results in some matches that took me around two hours, before someone gave up. I'm ready to throw in the towel at twenty minutes during each match. I'm not willing to go back and play again, due to how dull and monotonous it is. Its not a knock against this game, so much as its a knock against all MOBAs. I just can't invest the time in one sitting for something that begins to feel like work.\n\nSince this is a competitive game, there's an area where you can just watch players play live. Its got an elegant filter that you can quickly find the type of match you're looking for. It lets you learn tactics without having to look up guides or watch videos, not to mention scout future opponents. Its a nice touch that keeps everything in game.I watched several matches to see things play out to understand what works and what doesn't.\n\nI ended up having a lot of fun without spending anything.","September 14, 2015","true","6.5"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","3"

It's undergone huge transformations.  Game play is addictive and fun.  It is a unique blend of action and rts.  Sadly I've feel as though the developers dismissed the PVP aspect of the game; in favor of making it easier for new players to adjust.  Odd truth, as is you could once customize your Airmech (MOBA) the way you wanted using various parts and items.  You can no longer use parts in pvp it was "to hard to balance".  There are two classes of PVP Ranked and Unranked.  The Unranked system you are now allowed to use purchase able "Ultimate" Items and Pilots which means unranked pvp is now pay to win.  The Ranked system has a very small player base.  Probably 4 or 5 people that play consistently.\n\nI had high hopes that this game would find it's own niche as an esport type game but with the way it is now the player base is dwindling ...... or I feel it is.  Old veterans of the game are leaving it behind.  I find it heartbreaking actually.  I'm not sure what the developers could do to save this game but I feel like it's dying a slow death.

There are currently nine different airmechs(as of me typing this) that players can choose from, and more designs are planned to be added in the future! Each of the nine different airmechs play differently, each are equiped with different kinds of guns, missiles, and melee weapons along with 8 preset upgrades that will be unlocked as the mech levels up each match.\n\nEach mech also has 8 slots for the many buildable tanks, soldiers, turrets, and other things that the player uses to help the team advance or defend an area. These eight units are picked by the player before the start of any match. In addition to the player built units, each teams fortress automatically spawns basic soldiers to help capture outposts and attack the enemy.\n\nIn the base gamemode, two teams of atmost 3 Mech pilots(Players) fight each other to gain control of the outposts around the map while trying to advance to the enemy team's fortress and destroy it. The Outposts around the map work as unit builders, where players can pick up the various units they want to spawn during the match. Not a big PvP(Player versus Player) enthusiast? Don't worry! this gamemode is available in co-op mode(One team of players vs one team of AI controled Airmechs) and solo mode(one player and two AI vs an AI team).\n\nThe other big gamemode is called Survival. This gamemode pits four players against an endless onslaught of enemy units, whose soul purpose is to destroy the team's fotress.\n\nNow you might be thinking: "This all sounds really fun, but how pay to win is this game? Whats the catch?" And thats just it, there is no catch. Anything that can alter competitive gameplay in any way is bought with "Kudos", the currency in this game that is earned at the end of every match. This stuff piles up quickly and is only earnable through playing the game, but don't worry, once you start playing you will never run out of kudos!\n\nSo what costs actual money in this game? There is also another form of currency called diamonds. This currency is the "premium currency" of airmech. This premium currency is used to buy cosmetic items and Ultimate items, aswell as being the currency of the player market.\n\nCosmetic items are things that make your Airmech look cool. these range from Airmech skins, unit skins, different laser and exhaust colors, helmets for your airmechs, and pets that fly around you. None of these have any effect on gameplay.\n\nUltimate items are... well, Ultimate! These items are stronger versions of the buildable units and Airmechs that are normally usable.\n"But you said that paid items won't alter gameplay!"\nI said competitive gameplay. Ultimates are only usable in cooperative gamemodes, so if anyone is using them, they will always be on your team. Ultimate units are really just used when you want to dominate the AI team without as much effort.\n\nLastly there is the player market, where players can sell various cosmetics and items that are no longer sold in the shop for diamonds.\n\nIs it worth putting some money into this game? I certainly believe so. But whether or not you want to is up to you. I strongly suggest playing airmech for a couple of days before deciding to throw all of your money at the screen. If you don't want to put any money into the game, don't worry, we won't judge!\n\nThank you for reading this review, I know it was a long one.\n\nI hope you give this game a try, and enjoy it as much as I do!","July 8, 2015","true","341.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","16","22","8","0"

It also has great unit and character designs, with each having their own strengths, skills and weaknesses. Each Airmech (the player-controlled aircraft/combat mech) has VERY different strengths and abilities. No cookie-cutter, copy-and-paste stuff here. No sirree. This game also allows you to purchase a pack (Airmech Prime) that contains all the airmechs and a large number of units, pilots, and parts(for real money, obviously).\n\nFree players have access to all the content in the game (with the exception of the cosmetics and very few items). Some quests give diamonds (premium currency). Now for the bad news: for free players, ALL diamonds are locked until you make a purchase with real money (5$ or more). The game does allow you to take surveys for free diamonds, but I have received a single diamond for the waste-of-time surveys even though I received in-game mail saying that I got them.\n\nThis game is pretty good, however, with very few flaws (that I've personally experienced thus far, so I cannot speak for everyone else). Obviously my only annoyance is the locked diamonds (I just want all my guys in red! That's literally all). I do, however, recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind paying a little money. I also recommend this game to free players who don't mind the locked premium currency that "you get for free".","January 21, 2015","true","50.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

If you want a great MMO/singleplayer  with great AIs for solo play and a plethora of multiplayer options, this game is for you. Also, another thing that I love about this game is that you can post in and purchase from a completely public market, where you can sell excess items for the special gem currency. You don't necessarily have to buy gems, either. They can be crafted (sometimes) or gotten from the market. The actual gameplay, also, is impeccable. Keyboard and mouse controls are available for almost everything, and are simple and easy to learn. The graphics are smooth and very well done. Finally, it is possible to fully customise your Mech with different skins, cosmetic changes, pets, and more.

Before we start off, this game was in alpha and beta for like 2 years, and now they moved it in to early access. Its initial release was somewhere around 2012 or 2013, and honestly there has only been new classes and units, a few new maps and tons of skins and rares to collect that are for real-cash.\n\nThis game used to be pretty good but it now only stands for veterans, because the matchmaking is extremely poor and you'll always have this one guy who is just going to do everything. The strategies in this game is more irritating than anything, where sometimes the enemy is just going to go straight to your main base and attack it no matter how many anti-mech units you put over there. I would say the game is balanced to a degree though so atleast there's that.\n\nThe skins and rares to collect are swarming all over the game and its basically all real-cash. None of it is required, the game is 100% free but its really annoying when everyone are showing off their stuff and talking about it and how the market consists of like 80% collectors stuff. Some exclusive stuff are now also free, so that kinda frustrated me but i tried to not bother.\n\nCo-op and survival can be fun but it just doesnt hold up, especially when the multiplayer PvP is the core, which is unplayable becuz your win is based on luck.","December 24, 2012","false","224.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Kind of like DOTA, but with transforming mechs. Many different gamemodes make this game unique from other  games. Great tutorial explaining everything in the beginning of the game and the odds are a developer is chatting in global answering questions. DIfferent mechs make for different playstyles. (There is no "best" mech). For beginners, there is a COOP mode. There is also a survival mode (basically tower defence). And there is a PvP mode for players who have figured out the game and want more of a challenge then COOP. This is NOT Pay to win. The only thing Carbon Games sells is cosmetics and there is no way you can get an advantage over other players by your wallet.\nGreat game, 10/10 in my opinion.

This game is a mix of DOTA/LoL with a game like Starcraft. You control a character/hero that is your Airmech and there are creeps that spawn from your main base every so often. You can build your own units to fight by your side from a vast selection of units. Gameplay is usually fast and intense with plenty of aerial dog fighting and battlfield micro. This game is casual player friendly with opportunities for the more competetive player.\n\nOnly problems are if you're an Aussie, finding people to play with can be quite difficult. Lag is also an issue if you are an Oceanic player.\n\nFeel free to add me in game and set me as your referrer (shameless self-promotion :P ). My name is VIRUSALPHA and I'm one of the few Australian players.\n\nPros:\n+ LOTS OF CUSTOMISATION ( A CRAPTON OF CUSTOMISATION POSSIBLE)\n+ Fair Business Model\n+ Not pay to win\n+ Casual player friendly\n+ Intense gameplay\n+ Frequent updates, balance changes and bug fixes\n\nCons:\n- Not many Oceanic players\n- Meta shifts frequently post updates (which may or maynot be a good thing)\n- Meta meta meta. A lot of high tier players use the same tactic, strategy and loadout. People like to use the best units, best setup and best strategy. However if you're skilled enough you can work around it. Can be stale.\n\nSlightly Longer Review:\n\n(Adding on to the above)\n\nThe meta shifts A LOT when big updates come and rapidly change after balance changes. This is probably a good thing, however the game can become borning when everyone adopts the meta. There is a tremendous selection of pilots, airmechs, parts and units. The problem is balance. Achiving perfect balance and harmony is far from near. Thier are hunderds of units to use but generally high tier players pick the same 8-10. Why? because those units are best. There's tons of pilots but players tend to choose 3 because they are the best. There's 9 airmech classes but professional mainly use 3. This is just one of my dissatisfactions of the game. There are units/mechs/items that completely outclass others which is sad. Balance is yet to be achived in this game which is forgiveable because it's still in BETA.\n\nThe game's busienss model is fair, or even great. Everything can be purchased for in game currency which is amazing. A casual player can unlock plenty of items in 1 day. You can unlock all units, pilots and items for in game currency which is amazing. This currency is called Kudos. The premium currency in this game is Diamonds and the game gives you 500 to start with. With thos amount you can buy whatever you please but you CANNOT BUY POWER. You can earn diamonds through quests but these diamonds are locked until you make a purchase of anything in game and obtain silver VIP or higher. It's an incentive for you to invest money in the game with the smallest purchase avaiable being $5USD.\n\nGenerally diamonds are used to buy cosmetics to look fancy and ultra classy. You can buy Ultimate Variants of units which are UNBALANCED AND SUPER OVERPOWERED "BUT" these can only be used in solo play, player vs AI (co-op) and custom games. These units cannot be used in regualr (unranked or ranked) PvP. Generally these items are for noobs :P Hence, upon starting the game you receive a random ultimate unit in your inventory.\n\nNew players these days are VERY LUCKY. You get free items and cosmetics as you play the game. This is just a taste of what you get when you purchase diamonds. It's an incentive to purchase diamonds and if you do I suggest gettin the starter pack as it gives you best value for your money. So try out this game if you havent already. If you don't like it, simply uninstall.\n\nThis game has a drop system. In this drop systems you can receive crates, cosmtics, pets, consumale items, stuff and rare unit alternatives which cannot be purchased normally. This drop system is fair and gives you cool stuff which you can sell on the player market if you wish.\n\nThe market is acessable when you reach level 10 which isn't hard at all even for a casual player. At this level you can purchase stuff on the market. At level 50 you can sell stuff on the market. All items on the market are sold for premium currency. Unfortunately reaching level 50 is gonna take A LONG TIME. However after a purchase and obtaining silver VIP the marketis instanly acessable and for use. If you are not a VIP after selling an item you only get 30% of the diamonds you sold your item for with the rest being locked. So for instance if you sell a hat for 100 diamonds, you only get 30. There is also an in-game tax of 15%. So if you want to sell and earn 100 diamonds, your item will be listed for 115 diamonds. Once sold you get you 100 diamonds.\n\nThere's loadouts in which you can customise evrything you need for a game. You can choose up to 8 different types of units to put into your loadout. There are infantry, light vechicles, trucks, tanks, big tanks, even bigger tanks, artillery, healing, radar units, traps, turrets and socket units that provide speical effects. You have a 9th slot for a guardian that provides unquie effects such as healing, radar and for extra damage out put. In your loadout you can customise your airmech. You can change airmechs, customise its parts, change cosmetics and a whole lot of other stuff. You have a slot for an item which provide small buffs. Finally there is a space for your pilot which is very important as pilots usually depeict your play style.\n\nThe game has a crafting system which lets you craft a wide range of items but is restricted on current items you habe and your level.\n\nIn terms of gameplay you will always be using your airmech to carry your units across the map. You can pick your units up and micro them. There are mass commands for macroing. Tanks are the main unit composition with support units such as healing and radar/artillery jamming. There are many ways to play this game. This game features outposts. Once captured they provide different effects and raise your upkeep. Yes you have upkeep. You use hot keys to build units and collect them from eitehr your fortress or outpost to place on the ground and assign commands. Outposts and fortresses provide healing. Outposts are occupied by 4 infantry/creeps and can be neutralised by killing all 4. You can capture an outpost by filling it with 4 of your own infantry or creeps. You can use the outpost to your advantage by healing from it and producing units and deploying them from there. Generally if you have more outposts than the other guy you're well ahead in winning the game. There some sockets on your fortress and sometimes a few on your outposts. You can socket your "socket" units onto these to activate them or provide buffs to turrets. To are 2 ways of winning a game. The first is by having your opponent leave :P The other way is by reducing your opponent/s fortress health to 0. There 2 ways to go about it. You can do it traditionally by knocking on their door with an army/convoy of tanks or by capturing all outposts on the map putting you into the dominating postition. While the enemy in in domination their fortress slowly takes adamage after a 30 second warning. This game mechanic promotes movining out and not slwo turely gameplay.\n\nThis game often referrences other games and has special events often. For example you can find the Portal Cube, Sentry Turret, and Minecraft Creeper in game. Also the game also features a referral system in which you receive rewards. That's why you can find Total Biscuit, The Cynical Brit, HuskyStarcraft and Chimmney Swift in the game. Oh yeah about these events, special seasonal items are sold. Such as in Easter you can buy a Jesus pilot and during Christmas you can buy Santa.\n\nIf RTS is not your thing the game is often called FarmMech as you have a basecamp.... You can grow and builds stuff... It's like Farmville... heh.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardRTS/recommended/206500/","waywardRTS","wayward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardRTS/","95 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSince the player’s list of tasks is geographically diverse (units and turrets are produced at command hubs that can be captured, and must be ferried around the map) and incredibly time-sensitive, the player must hurry themselves breathlessly around the map being economist, logistics manager and combatant by turns, and shirking any of these duties is detrimental to their overall game state.\n\nLeave your build queue alone for too long, you’re depriving yourself of the support of the at times vital support of artillery, heavy tanks, or harass vehicles. Leave the front lines alone for too long, you’re leaving your units to be free money and levels for your opponent. Neglect your upgrades (which can only be applied at a structure, away from the frontlines) and you’re depriving yourself of tools to get yourself further ahead in the match.\n\nI would go so far as to say, and I do not say this lightly, that AirMech is one of the most mechanically demanding strategy games I have ever played. It is not quite as frenetic as StarCraft 2 can be, but barring that I cannot think of a game that puts this sort of onus on the player to act and think quickly. Making poor choices in game is immensely punishing in a way I am pressed to describe in a way that’d be meaningful to my audience. Just pumping out whatever units you want is giving away money and experience to the enemy. paying attention to the wrong thing for too long can lose you critical momentum and map control.\n\nAnd the beauty (in my mind) of this all is that the singular focus of the AirMech unit itself means that this game can be meaningfully played on a console. AirMech Arena for the Xbox One is in early access testing right now, and has been on the Xbox 360 for… I think about a year? Maybe a couple of months. The player is by needs a little less able to multitask, but the game is eminently playable with a controller.\n\nThis is NOT a comprehensive overview of the game. I have not touched at all on the game’s monetization model, which sells unit types and AirMech upgrades (and could easily be considered to give advantage to players who are willing to drop money on purchasing these things, which is potentially problematic though I personally don’t mind the model) but… I had to take a moment and share the admirably focused design of the core game experience, which I cannot help but appreciate.","May 22, 2015","true","38.3"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","13","21","2","0"

It's a nice blend of League of Legends and Starcraft. You can sit down and play a round in 5 minutes or play all day if you want.\n\nThe variety of units leads to a bunch of unique playstyles. Infantry, tanks, and artillery of different costs/power give you all sorts of options for attacking and countering your opponent. You also have to find the balance betwen spamming units and going commando with your AirMech which is alot of fun.\n\nThe graphics look good and aren't very demanding (I can play this on my Windows 8 tablet if I don't max the settings).\n\nThe game is free to play but you have to pay if you want cosmetics (just like League of Legends). There are two in-game currencies. You earn Kudos for playing and can spend them to unlock new units. You earn Diamonds by paying money and use them to unlock skins and cosmetics.\n\nThe game is great but keep in mind that it's still in beta. Units and maps are being rebalanced all the time. Sometimes the servers have problems and make the game laggy for a little while. That's all part of beta and totally expected.\n\nAirMech rocks!","January 31, 2014","true","189.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I personally felt like AirMech was a combination of Command and MOBA game mechanics.\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: There isn't much to say about the story in AirMech (that seems to be the theme among MOBA's these days, doesn't it?). The tutorial gives a type of story, “you're pilot of an AirMech” (Robot that can switch between Transformer-smash-your-face-mode and flying-harbinger-of-destruction) ...and that's about where the story stops and they say “okay screw it, you don't really care, you just want to learn the controls and blow stuff up.”\n\nGameplay: The controls are very straight forward, you use ASDW for up, down, right, left. Mouse to aim, shift to toggle between robot and flight modes, number keys for quick building selections, and a set of other shortcuts to make your response time faster and give commands to units.\nGenerally against the AI you don't need to learn and master these controls... you can learn them at your own pace... HOWEVER, if you want to get into the competition …Learn 'em and learn 'em quick, or else you won't last.\nOne final note about the Gameplay is that there are a few different game modes, you're not exclusively forced to play with others, or do battles against other places. The game modes are as follows: Solo, Co-op, PvP, CTF, Survival, Challenges, and Campaign. (It was announced during the beta)\n\nAchievements: AirMech has 101 achievements (06/10/15) at the time that I'm writing this review, I have 62% of these achievements, and have given up on the hope of getting 100% completion, because some of the achievements require spending real money on the game.\n\nPrice: AirMech is free to play, however, many features in game are locked unless you spend real money, many other features you can purchase with in-game rewards. To some people this is “pay-to-win”, but most of my battles were by myself against AI, so I didn't mind it.\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, AirMech is a solid game, plays well, fun to do by yourself or with/against friends. I recommend this game because of that. But I would warn fellow achievers that this game isn't an easy “100% completion” you will need time, luck, skill, and money to get all of these achievements.\nI recommend AirMech to MOBA players, people who are looking for a different game style to play, or anyone who has time to play Free Games.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update June 14, 2015:\nRedid this review on 06/11/15 to modernize it, don't worry you didn't miss anything in the old version.","December 9, 2012","true","56.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Its a good combination of MOBA and RTS. Its still in Beta so features are still being added and bugs are still being fixed. Its free to play with the option to pay for cosmetics. It can take awhile to unlock everything for free (kinda like League of Legends) but the easiest to use units are the cheapest.\n\nThere are several different game modes where you can play COOP against the AI or PvP against other players.\n\nThe basics are pretty easy to learn. Tactics like just spamming troops only work against unskilled players or the AI. I would definitely recommend COOP for awhile until you get the hang of things (and to try out new tactics and unit combinations). You can win a COOP game in under 5 mintues by just massing units but you will find yourself wrecked if you try to spam units against a skilled player in PvP.\n\nPvP is super fun but there is a huge spread as far as skill/strategy goes. I've absolutely destroyed less skilled players and have been absolutely destroyed by better players. I found it really helpful to spectate games played by skilled players to see what they do. The action is non-stop and super intense when you're playing against someone good (if your AirMech isn't constantly donig something, you're doing it wrong). Fortunately, the match-making system sorts you by skill levels (but you can still end up playing a skilled player if there aren't many people in match-making).\n\nThat said, I love AirMech. Coop is fun and relaxed while PvP gets the heart pumping. The developers are involved and listen to feedback. The community is small but friendly and helpful. You should definitely give AirMech a try!","March 31, 2014","true","84.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Well, mainly an RTS (If you've played Starcraft/Warcraft/Supreme Commander, this will feel familiar), except also with a mash of a few other things, like Territories from Halo & CoD with the way the maps are laid out. If one of your few quams w/ regular RTS gamesi is the lack of a DIRECT contribtion (other than being the ENTIRE ♥♥♥♥ING BRAINS of your military), then good news: Every person gets an "airmech" (hence the game's name), w/ which you can fly around, transporting troops & giving them some cover fire if you feel the need. Different mechs can do different things, such as: Steal units with the Saucer, launch quintillions of missiles as a Helix, turn invisible whilt piloting the Neo, & give your troops aura buffs as the Paladin... & there are more than that! Did I mention that they can switch between air & land mode? Well, they can. ;D I just have a few minor issues, such as the number of maps... there are only like 8 or 10. All in all, this is an excellent game. So get it.

It's much like MOBA games (Dota 2, LoL, etc.) but also a RTS (Real Time Strategy). In this you play as a robot and you can transform into different "AirMechs" like helicopters and jets, etc. There are plenty of pilots though you get to pick one of three at the start and unlock the rest while you play.

A mix of MOBA/RTS where creeps are commandable... This game has a great community, a great set of developers active in the community and good game moderation. The game is NOT pay to win. Units can be earned and ELO based matchmaking limits "pay exclusive" units and parts out of the game. The actual competitive game is exclusively limited to units available to everyone whether they pay or not.\n\nOn the other side for 9.99 the Starter Pack gives you 7500 diamonds (a very large amount of "pay" currency), VIP status in game along with lots of boosts. Lots of diamonds to buy cosmetic upgrades for the various airmechs.\n\nIt's free to play, give it a shot.

This is that game, given an udate. I also recall the single player version to be fun and somewhat addictive. This version allows play with up to four other people, as did the original...the difference here is the other three don't have to be sitting in YOUR place, sucking down YOUR Mountain Dew and eating your Cheetos. :)\n\nSeriously, this thing was fun for me then, it is now. Oh, the base game is free, which is to say a fair shake of content, easily competative to anyone that's spent money on the game. I recommend giving it a try.\n\nPlay every man for himelf, (I think?) 2 vs. 2, (I've played this one!) or just the two of you. Or alone, even. Did I mention it's free?

Creeper units spawn regularly, all creepers move to secure outposts which in return weakens the enemy fortress shield, allowing players and creep alike to destroy it.\n\nOh and all of the AirMechs are obtainable through the standard in-game currency (Kudos), no need for premium currency nor hours of frustrating grinding as you can earn the same rewards offline versus bots as you do versus other players online.\n\nI'm sure many of you would avoid F2P games due to the risk of playing something that is "Pay2Win", no need to worry about that with AirMech; the premium currency (Diamonds) can only buy you cosmetic items and super-units that are restricted to PvE Co-Op/Survival action.\n\nThe developers themselves, Carbon Games, are a very chill bunch of guys and gals, promoting fair and fun gameplay for all AirMech players.\nEven the overall community is very noob-friendly and casual, you will see many people just casually chatting, inviting people to games for some fun etc.\n\n\nOverall my only complaint is that right now there's only about 8 AirMechs, i'm going to assume that the devs will add more to increase variation in the game etc.\n\nIf you have the time, i truly recommend trying this out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dwerpy/recommended/206500/","Dwerpy","Kazumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dwerpy/","122 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAirMech® is a mixture of popular MOBA's such as Dota 2[blog.dota2.com] and League of Legends[na.leagueoflegends.com] combined with lots of entertaining strategy aspects of an RTS. This game is VERY fun, especially with friends, and the matches are quite fast paced, ranging from 8-20 minutes. However, if you are planning on going into a PvP game, make sure you have a good idea of what you are doing, as Match Making can be a bit unforgiving with who you are up against. AirMech's large varity of Units, Pilots and Mechs to choose from, allows for lots of different strategies and playstyles, meaning that each game won't always be the same against different enemy players. The controls are fairly easy to learn and pick up, and the dogfights are always quite exciting to play out. Keep in mind when playing this game though, if you want the best units, gear, AirMechs, cosmetics or EXP/Kudos gain, then you must purchase a VIP Membership. Fortunately, having a VIP Membership won't put you at an extreme advantage against other free players, keeping the playing-field fair.\n\nA very entertaining, free game that is definitely worth your time, 8.5/10","April 25, 2015","true","14.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

You get to train units that you can pick up in aircraft mode and drop down to capture enemy bases - along with the creeps that spawn from your and your opponents bases - and also attack enemy bases in your ground mode. There are quite a veriaty of AirMechs to choose from, ranging from the Osprey which is a medic Airmech, to a Warthog which is a minigun weilding, high damaging AirMech.","June 21, 2014","true","66.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Made with PvP as a main focus the game is competetive and fun. It's almost hard to describe how this game is played because it has so many factors yet remains fast paced.

I enjoy how this game is free to play, and no player is ever forced to spend any money on this game. I personally have spent money on this game, because I like it enough to give it a little extra funding. Spedning this money however, has not made me a more skilled player, or better at this game in any way. Those who don't feel like spending money on this game, don't have to, which is one of the most appealing aspects of this game. AirMech is also very fun. If you need time to kill, you could easily just sit down and knock out the hours. And the game is not so addicting that you can't stop playing it. The developers of the game are very connected to the community, which is very nice. The community itself is also very friendly. So I HIGHLY reccommend this game to anyone. It is free, so download it and give it a try! And if you need any information, there is almost always someone in the chat who knows the answer to your question.

This is not a salty rant.\n\nThis is a summary of my thoughts of Airmech from a player who has played since 2011. I never in my life thought I would give this game a bad review. I stuck behind the devs in thick and thin, but now... ♥♥♥♥. Dont even waste your time.\n\nThis WAS such a good game, like back in 2012-3 when browsable custom lobbies were a thing, and the dumb arm deployment system never exsisted.\n\nIf your going to waste your time on somthing, read this transcript, not this game.\n\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: You put it on steam after a year of alpha dev\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: Set it as early access\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: Free2play too\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: So\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: Your playerbase starts\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: growing\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: You begin to smile\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: Hey, im getting more money\n[10:36 PM] /r/ D0K: I can hire another coder\n[10:37 PM] /r/ D0K: maybe a artist to help with 3d stuff\n[10:37 PM] /r/ D0K: Alright\n[10:37 PM] /r/ D0K: Things are going great\n[10:37 PM] /r/ D0K: Your playerbase is active\n[10:37 PM] /r/ D0K: You continue making new content\n[10:37 PM] /r/ D0K: and perfecting your game\n[10:38 PM] /r/ D0K: You promise your playerbase that they will leave beta in 2013\n[10:38 PM] /r/ D0K: Your game is pretty much a finished product\n[10:38 PM] /r/ D0K: As a f2p rts, your doing amazing\n[10:38 PM] /r/ D0K: So, you hire another coder\n[10:38 PM] /r/ D0K: on with experience\n[10:39 PM] /r/ D0K: People are buying your priemier currency like its going to run out\n[10:40 PM] /r/ D0K: Even thought your rts game is doing great, you notice that new players have a hard time with the game, so you deside to make things easier for them\n[10:40 PM] /r/ D0K: You have solo\n[10:40 PM] /r/ D0K: coop\n[10:40 PM] /r/ D0K: custom pvp\n[10:40 PM] /r/ D0K: and ranked pvp modes\n[10:40 PM] /r/ D0K: But new players arent going into ranked\n[10:40 PM] /r/ D0K: What do you do?\n[10:41 PM] /r/ D0K: Dispite the playerbase protesting\n[10:41 PM] /r/ D0K: You take away browsable custom lobbies\n[10:41 PM] /r/ D0K: even thought most active pvpers say that they first learned in casual custom pvp lobbies\n[10:42 PM] /r/ D0K: Vetrans players leave\n[10:42 PM] /r/ D0K: New players stay in coop modes\n[10:42 PM] /r/ D0K: so what do you do?\n[10:42 PM] /r/ D0K: OH\n[10:42 PM] /r/ D0K: LETS MAKE A NEW UI FOR THE ENTIRE GAME\n[10:42 PM] /r/ D0K: Release date pushed back to 2014\n[10:43 PM] /r/ D0K: Bugs and glitches take up all of your time\n[10:43 PM] /r/ D0K: With the dwindling pvp playerbase\n[10:43 PM] /r/ D0K: even more players leave\n[10:43 PM] /r/ D0K: Oh well lets just ignore that\n[10:44 PM] /r/ D0K: Instead of doing something, lets add a complicated part system that ruins the game balance wise\n[10:44 PM] /r/ D0K: Broken balanced games cause more players to leave\n[10:44 PM] /r/ D0K: HEY\n[10:44 PM] /r/ D0K: Lets promise a new character\n[10:45 PM] /r/ D0K: that should retain more people...\n[10:45 PM] /r/ D0K: So, people stay\n[10:45 PM] /r/ D0K: And you release a terribly balanced character that breaks the game even more\n[10:45 PM] /r/ D0K: With balance a mess\n[10:45 PM] /r/ D0K: You need to do something quick\n[10:46 PM] /r/ D0K: because your majority of playerbase is coop farmers, and ingame market lurkers\n[10:46 PM] /r/ D0K: so, you put together a small group of active pvpers who remain\n[10:46 PM] /r/ D0K: make them a balance council\n[10:47 PM] /r/ D0K: Seems to work\n[10:47 PM] /r/ D0K: they fix balance\n[10:47 PM] /r/ D0K: But bills still need to be payed\n[10:47 PM] /r/ D0K: You need more players again\n[10:47 PM] /r/ D0K: So you strike a deal with Ubisolf\n[10:48 PM] /r/ D0K: Even though you are still in early access\n[10:48 PM] /r/ D0K: You develope a release a Xbox One version of your game\n[10:48 PM] /r/ D0K: Hey, you got more people!\n[10:48 PM] /r/ D0K: People are coming back!\n[10:49 PM] /r/ D0K: pvp is becoming somwhat active again\n[10:49 PM] /r/ D0K: Members of the balance council are leading the community\n[10:49 PM] /r/ D0K: organizing tournies\n[10:49 PM] /r/ D0K: making promotional videos\n[10:49 PM] /r/ D0K: These videos are much better than yours\n[10:50 PM] /r/ D0K: so you put them on your steam page because your 2012 trailer doesnt resemble what your game is now.\n[10:50 PM] /r/ D0K: These active members carry your game\n[10:50 PM] /r/ D0K: You get more money\n[10:50 PM] /r/ D0K: Hey, let hire another artist\n[10:51 PM] /r/ D0K: Oh, he wants to remake all the cartoon art in the UI\n[10:51 PM] /r/ D0K: Make it more realistic\n[10:51 PM] /r/ D0K: So he gets to work\n[10:51 PM] /r/ D0K: The cartoon avatars that represent characters in the game are replaced\n[10:51 PM] /r/ D0K: and they look like ♥♥♥♥\n[10:52 PM] /r/ D0K: ruins the uniqness of the game\n[10:52 PM] /r/ D0K: Mean while all the players that are on Xbox are mad because patches with new content will not get pushed through\n[10:52 PM] /r/ D0K: You begin losing players again\n[10:53 PM] /r/ D0K: All the pvp players on PC are getting board with the game\n[10:53 PM] /r/ D0K: because you are focusing on getting content released to XBOX\n[10:53 PM] /r/ D0K: With isnt possible because Ubi is a little ♥♥♥♥♥\n[10:54 PM] /r/ D0K: As the players leave PC and Xbox, you ry to address the issue that new players arnt playing pvp\n[10:54 PM] /r/ D0K: The community tries to convince you that browsable custom pvp lobbies are the answer\n[10:55 PM] /r/ D0K: but you say it will not fit in with the new UI\n[10:55 PM] /r/ D0K: but you add custom lobbies that no one can see.\n[10:55 PM] /r/

If you like MOBAs then you'll probably like it. However, it's a LOT faster than LoL and Dota and also a lot easier. Unless you're playing PvP, where you get destroyed in like, 5 minutes.\n\nIt's usually 8-15 minutes long for each game. If you're grinding, it'll take less than 10 minutes and I can debate that some matches could take even less than 7 minutes if you're rushing the game.\n\nAlso, it's not where your minions are always the same, your minions vary from all sorts of kinds from those who heal you, those who are for offence and those who can tank out the damage the enemies are giving you. Its the combination of all those three categories that build up a strong team. But it only has 9 AirMechs (Heroes) you can choose, all can be unlocked without using money but by leveling up.\n\nWhile not entirely all of this game is play to earn more things, there are some things that can only be unlocked via real life money. Such as if you want to earn more EXP and kudos (that's what they call their currency) per match won / lost / spectated, you will have to buy a VIP membership. If you want the best units and and cool cosmetics then you'd also need to pay for it however, most of the game's purchasable items via money is cosmetics.\n\nIt's a good game, I recommend you guys play it. 8/10\n\n~Cloudy","April 17, 2014","true","45.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Played it for days when i first got it and even bought some of the in-game currency. Which for me is nothing short of a miracle.\nGot tons of the in-game currency for free, thanks to the amount of generous players doing tons of diamond rolls. And had a huge amount of fun playing the game. And it was a fantastic game. Bought almost every unit available, unlocked pretty much everything and then.......nothing. Very few new updates, not even a handful of new units and no new Airmech. The new map has been in beta since forever and basically nothing was ever released so the game rapidly got boring. Which is a massive shame, as it has huge potential. With regular updates and new units...etc, this game could be epic.\n\nSo i stopped going on it, except every once in a while to relive what could be such a super game.....Until today.... Whoever thought of that silly, annoying grabby arm thing that drops off your units has just completely ruined the game for me. Now when i build things, i lose them, they all get built in the same place and it just completely destroys the game.\n\nI recommend the game in the begining, as starting it is ace! But once you've unlocked everything, you'll rapidly get bored of it. And as you won't have played it without the ridiculous grabby arm, then it might not bother you so much, but otherwise i cannot recommend it at all.","April 24","false","57.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Some might not like the graphics but I would rather have decent graphics and lots of content, than amazing graphics and a game with only 4 maps, that you have to pay another $60 for for more content that should have been in it the first place.

Highest and lowest numbers win Diamonds!\n- Factions help newer ones to learn the game\nI am the Leader of "[Rise]" Faction, contact me ingame for an invite to [Rise], there i am known as Dartis.\nSome Factions also have Joining requirements, something to strive for.\n- For those that sign up to the Forums, there are Giveaways hosted by Generous AirMech Members and Players.\n\nSome things new players confront when just starting:\n- Diamonds! As said, these are the Premium currency obtainable with real money (generally).\n- Market. There are Distinctive benefits (like reduced Tax) for those that are at least Silver VIP ($5USD) over those that are unable to (or choose not to). This makes selling on the Market (and earning those precious Diamonds) harder for those F2P'ers (however this isn't necassary to play or be good at the game itself).\n- Kudos. Even though you will gradually earn Kudos, some players find it takes too long to buy everything they need to play (but please don't spend your early Diamonds on these things, you may regret it later).\n- PVP. Ranked PVP doesnt allow Parts or Ultimates but Unranked PVP does. This has led to some believing AirMech is now P2W as Ultimates are only available with Diamonds. However Ultimates were 'nerfed' a few patches back and are not as OP as they used to be, they now only give an advantage. As an incentive, "Honor" was released for those who play PVP Without Ultimates against those that Do - earn enough Honor and you'll unlock some exclusive stuff...\n\nOverall, I love Airmech.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxyBoxes/recommended/206500/","FoxyBoxes","2401 Penitent Tangent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxyBoxes/","217 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's a good game for single player but the multiplayer is completely unplayable. Their servers are absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ (unless games are hosted by player's clients, which would make a lot of sense). Constantly being killed when far out of range of enemy weapons, invisible missiles, game freezing during due to lag, I was kicked no less than three times because of 'connectivity issues' which were completely out of my hands. Just a joke, especially when my net speed is 30 up/4 down with a constant 20-30 ping. Get your ♥♥♥♥ together, Carbon. I should not be lagging this badly.\n\nThe "hey buy stuff" messages that are constantly shoved in your face leave a bad taste in my mouth, but they have to make money somehow I guess. Maybe they'll eventually be able to afford semi-decent server infrastructure one day. I would like to state that I firmly believe that the server issues are the game's only problem aside from balance issues in low level PvP; that is to say, you can't get some units below a specific level - most notably the Goliath, which is level 7 and wrecked me several times because I had no answer (the Buster did some work, but it's just not enough).\n\nI understand that the game is early access, but it's been in development for almost THREE YEARS. This is not acceptable for a game in this situation, especially when they constantly throw "buy this and you could have all this cool stuff! Just £20!" messages in your face.\n\nConclusion / TL;DR\nAll in all the game is built fundamentally around multiplayer and that's a shame, because the multiplayer is completely unplayable due to server issues. It's hard to get into because you'll get stomped by people with units you can't buy, but the singleplayer could be thoroughly enjoyable if the bots weren't utterly brain dead. It's free so certainly try it out with friends, but my final verdict is that you should just save your time and play free games without crippling server issues.","March 28, 2015","false","6.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

It's immediately engaging, and nice to look at.  If you're into twitch-style shooter games, this could be a step up for you as compared to other more traditional MOBAs.  However, it's far, far too ambitious for me to enjoy.\n\nYou start off learning a bit about your Airmech and how to manipulate the "minion" units under your command.  At this point I'd say the interface and the ability to affect the game could just stop, and remain perfectly enjoyable.  Just being able to transform and fly around in the middle of a large-scale conflict, move units around, and the novelty of the control system would make an enjoyable game.  Unfortunately your responsibilities don't stop there, by any means.\n\nNext you find out that you can produce units, that indeed you need to on a constant basis, while managing credits and the time it takes to build them.  You must select units other than infantry by flying over them while holding a key and give them more explicit orders with other keys.  You use the function keys to create upgrades for your Airmech, which are extremely varied and a bit confusing in how they work at the outset.  Meanwhile you are trying to attack enemy Airmechs who scream out of the air at you from close off-screen, manage your territory, pick up your own units with another key that is unreliable at best, transform and use special attacks when needed.\n\nI'd compare this game to a side-scrolling shooter combined with a turn-based board game or an RTS.  There is of course a learning curve and I'm sure a high degree of expertise can be gained in it, but the end product is both too demanding and too frenetic to be very appealing to either specific crowd.  I'd have been quite happier if they toned it down a notch and decided to stick more with one or the other.","April 9, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Destroy the enemy fortress to win! To help you on your quest to defeat the enemy fortress, you can establish units and defenses to guard the outposts you secure, and to protect your fortress. Outposts are captured by infantry units after the outpost is "netural". Which means it can be captured by either side.\n\nAirmech can be a PvP or PvE or even a co-op game! There are a varity of different units, turrets, and defense units! Huge tanks, normal tanks, armored and manned jeeps, soldiers, laser pistols, and much more! Airmech is free, so no worries there.

Unlike most RTS games you can actually fight alongside your units, not to mention transport them-key feature, I love this game because of it.  The community is also a boss and really helpful, and you can go so many different routes with playing styles.  And there's no worry about this being a pay2win game because even if you play against someone with diamond/gold/silver VIP or Airmech Prime the devs focus on balancing it out for the players who don't buy any boosters/DLC! Not to mention the developers are very active in the community, which again, is awesome.

Sure if you want to use the cool stuff you just need to buy one thing, but after that, the game only seems to get better with that "Since-of-accomplishment" feeling! And I still feel (Honest opinion, not fact) that it is fair to buy a $9.99 USD "UPGRADE", reason being is because they pretty much give you access to almost everything except "Diamonds".

The gaem mechanics are fantastic, and the overall structure proves to be amazing. Deploying, creating, and instructing units are so fun, using huge scaled assaults of tanks an such to invade, capture, or destroy enemy outposts or bases.","December 17, 2013","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virsai/recommended/206500/","Virsai","Fate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virsai/","113 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFree to play, the words that make many people think pure grind-fest, pay to win aspects and generally commitment to playing constantly. While there are bonuses to perks, the thing I love is that most of the items you can purchase with premium money, you can get by winning battles. In addition, all the Over Powered items is restricted. Wait, this isn't a pay to win? I don't really think so. From what I have seen of the premium and VIP shop, it's actually very balanced. Those who do pay with real money get a slighter advantage, but not by much. Alrighty, we got the worst aspect of the game out, let's dive right into this with swords a slicing, is this worth the time? Surely, this early access game is horrible, you say! Look at all the other EA games that have scarred our wallets with promises of updates.\n\nFear not, for this game is a gem which I highly recommend to anyone who is a StarCraft fan, RTS lover, or just love shooting the crud out of the other team. Now you might be asking why would you love this if you are a StarCraft fan, this game doesn't even resemble that Blizzard gem most people know and love. Actually, the art style of this game reminds me of that, very bold, isometric, and has units you can immediately relate to. In addition, another cool feature is that you have an upkeep, a maximum number of units on the field at any given time. As you capture more outposts, that number increases, if they get captured, it lowers thus making it a hectic scramble to try and take control of them as fast as possible. That's about as far as that goes, but if you are a die-hard fan of Command & Conquer, I suggest you try this out right now.\n\nPiloting the mech is actually very responsive. I point to shoot, it aims and kills. The speed of each game will have you thinking fast, moving from point to point, constantly responding to attacks. The difficulty curve of the game is slightly flat, but the customization of the game is just massive! You get to pilot one of several mechs, ranging from space ships and flying saucers to bombers and fighter jets. I guarantee that you will pick the game up thinking about spending 10 minutes in one match, then find yourself playing for hours.\n\nThere are a few problems that I see with this game and one of them is the graphics. When you open up the game, it is in windowed mode which is nice, but I'm usually afraid of clicking out of the game while in battle which might cost me. Putting it in full screen, I immediately regret that. Everything becomes fuzzy and distorted, making the text hard to read and the gameplay a bit annoying. This is not game-breaking, but you will be deciding which you would prefer, having the small screen or going full screen. Another thing that bothers me is that navigation is a slight problem. Everything is easy to find, but the problem lies in the layout. As you go through, it's a mixture of large tabs, small tabs, intermixed sized tabs, and buttons.\n\nOther than those minor problems, this game is extremely fun to play. It will take a while to get use to the controls and field of play, but once you learn how to transform and move your units from point A to point B, you will be strategizing to take the next outpost. The gameplay is very solid, there are a ton of quests for you to do and challenges if you want to sharpen your skill. For an Early Access game, this is a highly refined and very addictive game.","July 6, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is so unique. The graphics are cartoony and rich. The Transformer feel of the game is just so cool. It is a mix between Starcraft and DotA! YES! Both MLG games put into one uniquely brewed game. The game has a smooth approach with balancing four main things, money, power, outposts, and your base. You have to make sure you have enough money to supply your units, enough power to build more, make sure you have outposts to add more power or money generators and make sure your base is secure. If the game is played right (Cap all out posts[NO♥♥♥♥INGRUSHING♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S]) you will have a blast with friends, or meet some new ones. This game mixes strategy with casual action. I love it and it is better that it is F2P. Pick this up now.

This is a  fun  hands on RTS.  I had missed playing Herzog and this REALLY scratches the ich. Only things I dont  like is its a  Free to  Pay business model so you get the feel of a salesmen sitting next to you tryign to sell you a new vaccum.... and the  buttons/units need better tool tips. Some data like  damage per second  armor  speed  that sort of thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/A087/recommended/206500/","A087","Alpha-087","http://steamcommunity.com/id/A087/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNot a hardcore MOBA player by any means.  I do play RTS games a bit though.  This game feels like a nice combination between the too.  It's a bit streamlined, perhaps more than I'd personally like, but definitely not enough to keep the game from being enjoyable.\n\nAirMech, as the name suggests, has you controlling a machine that can transform between an airship and mech.  While in airship mode you can deploy units which you can queue up to build at any time during the game.  With mech (ground) mode mostly being just for combat.  However certain AirMechs do offer some additional perks to being either on the ground or in the air, such as an aura buff for your troops while in mech mode, or a weapon that can fire both at air and ground units.\n\nAll AirMechs are in fact available and relatively easy to obtain for free, as well as the vast majority of PvP-enabled deployable Units.  The balancing of player-controlled AirMechs seems pretty solid, as does the balance of most Units you command.\n\nCurrently the game offers solo play and cooperative play (Only 90 minutes of it per day will earn you XP/Currency unless you make at least one purchase).  There is PvP as well, of course, and that is really the focus of this game as it is with any other MOBA, though if you're more casual, you might still enjoy the PvE elements as well.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a great game for both the casual player who's into the RTS and MOBA style of the game for the PvE elements and the hardcore player who's in it for the PvP elements.  Free to play with lack of a real Pay2Win, a very high value per dollar when you do actually spend money, and a game that runs well on almost any PC.  If you've read this far, just stop and go try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.","May 5, 2014","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was not expecting much, because I thought it was either a MOBA or a brawler, neither of which I am a fan of. But, it was free, so I decided to download it. It well surpassed my expectations. It's more on the MOBA side but better than the other ones out there. It is fast paced with the units having almost as much power as the airmechs, or the hero character similar to other MOBAs. There is just so much potential to this game. There are many customizable options and it isn't a pay to win kind of game. It's definitly worth the download so far\n\nThe only things that I believe should be added are the following (it's still in early access, so i'm not too worried)\n-The lack of maps\n-Most of the maps are extremely similar according to the layout.\n-Some connections issues (i.e. latency, even though we have extremely new internet equipment [router, motem, all that jazz]).\n-CTF mode has yet to function (at least as far as I can tell)\n\nAnd that's all the issues I can come up with.

Chances are you don't know what that is. HZ was one of the best underrated games for the Genesis, and way ahead of its time. It was arguably the first RTS, predating even Dune II. But enough history, just what the hell is this game?\n\nImagine Smash TV except that you are flying and in a much bigger map. You're trying to destroy the opponent's base, and to help you do that, you purchase and deploy units as a flying transport with guns. But that's not all! Your flying transport can transform into a giant robot and can attack enemy ground forces, letting you directly participate in the action instead of sitting around micromanaging bases. If you die, you undergo a rez timer, losing precious time to fend off the inevitable advance.\n\nTheir servers are... okay. If someone's ping gets even moderately high, the game chugs and a vote pops up. Not cool.\n\nFor all its good points, the game is still incomplete, being in active beta. There's no combat music (yet). This is a shame because HZ actually had really good music, by the same person who did Thunderforce. Hopefully their musican will do justice.\n\nFurthermore, this game has NO STORY whatsoever. Even HZ had... an intro and an ending, with a manual adding slightly more detail. HZ also had a single player campaign, which is what I spent most of my time on back then. Airmech has none of that. Sure you can play maps solo and earn in-game credits, but there doesn't feel like any goal or ending in sight.\n\nBut why not just go ahead and give it a try? The game is very much free to play, funded with microtransactions. There's only a handful of things you can't obtain without cash, and even then most of those cash items won't turn the tide for you.","April 4, 2013","true","147.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each team builds units to defend their fortress or attack opposing team's fortress. You can have your AirMech play the role of support, or you can use it to aid your offensive line. There is quite a selection of unit loadouts, AirMechs, and even upgrades to choose from. So far, there are a number of quests and a few challenges to keep you busy for a while.\n\nIf you don't think that's a lot, don't worry; the game is still in beta, so there is still more to come.\n\nThe best part of all: it's free. You can still enjoy most of the features of the game normally, but if you want more, just buy anything with a purchase of at least $9.99 USD, or buy AirMech Prime.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PowerLich/recommended/206500/","PowerLich","Lord of Graves","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PowerLich/","47 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAirMech is a game that has a lot of potential. An Action Real Time Strategy game featuring transforming mechs, customizable loadouts with tons of different units? Sounds like a dream game.\n\nThe question is, is it a realistic dream? I think it is.\n\nLet me start by saying AirMech has a very small playerbase right now compared to other Free to Play online games. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the game is still fun when played versus bots.\n\nThe game has a bit of Pay to Win by having items be unlocked exclusively with in-game currency that can be purchase with real-life money, but the in-game currency is acquired at a pretty decent amount so you'll find yourself being able to buy two or three new units or a new pilot. The only thing you'll really find yourself grinding for is the ability to customize a mech, but all of the mechs are available at start to play as, just not to customize.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and fast paced and heavily strategy based. Based on which mech you use you'll find yourself playing the game quite differently. My personal favorite mech is the UFO, which has so little outgoing damage and so little damage reduction I don't even bother shooting most of the time. The fact that the games are exclusively 2v2 is understandable given the small playerbase, but it makes for a less action packed game than it could be for people who play as more strategy heavy mechs than pew pew heavy mechs.\n\nThe game has a lot of growing room, and I see it becoming very big if the game adjusts some of its.... Commercialistic... Aspects.\n\nI personally don't mind that the game has a lot of things on sale, but it's a LOT of things on sale, and you're going to be flooded with them the moment you load up the game. If I want to buy something, I will, I promise, but honestly having giant ads for your in-game items flash before my eyes right when I load the game makes me not want to buy them.\n\nThe game is being constantly updated, though it seems that a lot of the updates are for things you have to buy. For a game in Beta, I feel this needs to be changed. Yeah, I understand that you need to put food on the table, but you're in the business of making a video game, which is also the business of making money. If your game is fun, and people enjoy it, the players will come and the money will flow in.\n\nAll in all, as it stands, I give AirMech a nice little 7/10. It's above average. It has a lot of potential it needs to expand on, and it has a bit of a money hungry attitude it needs to tone down on. Gameplay wise it's a fantastic Free to Play game that rewards the player for being good at the game. If you're considering giving it a try, there's no reason not to.","January 20, 2014","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's like a technological, futuristic, and much much more user friendly version of DOTA 2. It's free, but actually free. Not the sort of free where you can download it but have to buy in-game content to have any fun at all. This is legitimately free. You can buy almost everything with in-game credits (though you can also buy those with real money, of course), and it's not impossible to get your hands on the actual cash-based currency that lets you buy special stuff. I'll be honest, ♥♥♥♥♥ing enough in game money to buy the quality items takes a long time, but the game is really fun, so you don't mind. Also, there's a nice achievement system thatalways gives you something to do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockkttt/recommended/206500/","rockkttt","Carcosa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockkttt/","344 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is not an easy game to fit into one static category like rts or MOBA, in fact it's kind of a mixture of both.I have a background in both genres, I play alot of Age of Empires and League of Legends, so I understand the mechanics that go into games like those. When I play this game it feels like the perfect balance in controls and it is really easy to learn. In game you are basically a transformer with the ability to fly, pick up troops, build an army, and destroy other airmechs. The goal of every match is to capture a base, build armies to capture other bases, and then take out the enemies base.\n\nNow even though I said the controls were near perfect and I generally enjoy the game but it isn't without faults. The game looks as if it takes alot of strategy to succeed at but that just isn't the case. Every match I play nowadays consist of both teams building moneymakers (structures that give the player resources to build soldiers) and then sending an army to the middle of the map where a major base is. If the base is taken then the game is basically over at that point because it is such a strong chokepoint that becomes impenetrable. Once that base is taken then another army is sent to the base of their enemy and the game ends. This flaw in game design makes it that every game is basically the same and if you lose the middle base then your game is over and you might as well sit back and watch.\n\nI am still recommending this game because it is not completed and there is a chance that the developers will change the layout of each map so that their is no stronghold in the middle that ends the game once taken. I am convinced that if that error is fixed then this game will become one of my new favourites.","June 19, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Chances are you don't know what that is. HZ was one of the best underrated games for the Genesis, and way ahead of its time. It was arguably the first RTS, predating even Dune II. But enough history, just what the hell is this game?\n\nImagine Smash TV except that you are flying and in a much bigger map. You're trying to destroy the opponent's base, and to help you do that, you purchase and deploy units as a flying transport with guns. But that's not all! Your flying transport can transform into a giant robot and can attack enemy ground forces, letting you directly participate in the action instead of sitting around micromanaging bases. If you die, you undergo a rez timer, losing precious time to fend off the inevitable advance.\n\nTheir servers are... okay. If someone's ping gets even moderately high, the game chugs and a vote pops up. Not cool.\n\nFor all its good points, the game is still incomplete, being in active beta. There's no combat music (yet). This is a shame because HZ actually had really good music, by the same person who did Thunderforce. Hopefully their musican will do justice.\n\nFurthermore, this game has NO STORY whatsoever. Even HZ had... an intro and an ending, with a manual adding slightly more detail. HZ also had a single player campaign, which is what I spent most of my time on back then. Airmech has none of that. Sure you can play maps solo and earn in-game credits, but there doesn't feel like any goal or ending in sight.\n\nBut why not just go ahead and give it a try? The game is very much free to play, funded with microtransactions. There's only a handful of things you can't obtain without cash, and even then most of those cash items won't turn the tide for you.","April 4, 2013","true","147.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is so unique. The graphics are cartoony and rich. The Transformer feel of the game is just so cool. It is a mix between Starcraft and DotA! YES! Both MLG games put into one uniquely brewed game. The game has a smooth approach with balancing four main things, money, power, outposts, and your base. You have to make sure you have enough money to supply your units, enough power to build more, make sure you have outposts to add more power or money generators and make sure your base is secure. If the game is played right (Cap all out posts[NO♥♥♥♥INGRUSHING♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S]) you will have a blast with friends, or meet some new ones. This game mixes strategy with casual action.

Or tired that your creeps are just annoyingly stupid?\nTry this half strategy half rpg game, you can fully customize your mecha with cosmetics and equipment to improve its strenght.\nOf course as it's a free to play game it has to have the premium part, but it's not a pay to win game, so even if you have the 'ultra' version of some units, you can't use them on pvp.\nBut the vip version offers a hugue ammount of skins for your mech and that makes it speccially attractive.\nYou can play PVP as you wish but not everybody is so brave, so you have a pve combat system, to beat the nasty npc with your friends.\n\nIf there's something I could complain, is that there are not very much maps, units or team colours. Also the max player cap is 4 in a 2vs2 pvp match. But that's just the beginning of this game.

I do play RTS games a bit though.  This game feels like a nice combination between the too.  It's a bit streamlined, perhaps more than I'd personally like, but definitely not enough to keep the game from being enjoyable.\n\nAirMech, as the name suggests, has you controlling a machine that can transform between an airship and mech.  While in airship mode you can deploy units which you can queue up to build at any time during the game.  With mech (ground) mode mostly being just for combat.  However certain AirMechs do offer some additional perks to being either on the ground or in the air, such as an aura buff for your troops while in mech mode, or a weapon that can fire both at air and ground units.\n\nAll AirMechs are in fact available and relatively easy to obtain for free, as well as the vast majority of PvP-enabled deployable Units.  The balancing of player-controlled AirMechs seems pretty solid, as does the balance of most Units you command.\n\nCurrently the game offers solo play and cooperative play (Only 90 minutes of it per day will earn you XP/Currency unless you make at least one purchase).  There is PvP as well, of course, and that is really the focus of this game as it is with any other MOBA, though if you're more casual, you might still enjoy the PvE elements as well.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a great game for both the casual player who's into the RTS and MOBA style of the game for the PvE elements and the hardcore player who's in it for the PvP elements.  Free to play with lack of a real Pay2Win, a very high value per dollar when you do actually spend money, and a game that runs well on almost any PC.  If you've read this far, just stop and go try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.","May 5, 2014","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I play this game it feels like the perfect balance in controls and it is really easy to learn. In game you are basically a transformer with the ability to fly, pick up troops, build an army, and destroy other airmechs. The goal of every match is to capture a base, build armies to capture other bases, and then take out the enemies base.\n\nNow even though I said the controls were near perfect and I generally enjoy the game but it isn't without faults. The game looks as if it takes alot of strategy to succeed at but that just isn't the case. Every match I play nowadays consist of both teams building moneymakers (structures that give the player resources to build soldiers) and then sending an army to the middle of the map where a major base is. If the base is taken then the game is basically over at that point because it is such a strong chokepoint that becomes impenetrable. Once that base is taken then another army is sent to the base of their enemy and the game ends. This flaw in game design makes it that every game is basically the same and if you lose the middle base then your game is over and you might as well sit back and watch.\n\nI am still recommending this game because it is not completed and there is a chance that the developers will change the layout of each map so that their is no stronghold in the middle that ends the game once taken. I am convinced that if that error is fixed then this game will become one of my new favourites.","June 19, 2014","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

WELL! Try this for style\n\n\nEdit: This used to be my favorite game. I've played it since 2011. I met the developers at PAX when they only had a tiny corner in someone else's booth. I was so excited when new patches came out and I bought all sorts of silly flair because I loved supporting the developers of such a great game. Over the past year or so things have taken an odd turn. Entire new ranges of unnecessary and overpriced sub-items are available that modify your mechs. Now they have de-powered the silly just-for-fun mechs as some kind of cash grab and made the parts available to play in PVP, this looks an awful lot like pay to win. This makes me and my wallet happy that now I don't need to spend money :)","May 30, 2014","true","219.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PowerLich/recommended/206500/","PowerLich","Lord of Graves","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PowerLich/","47 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAirMech is a game that has a lot of potential. An Action Real Time Strategy game featuring transforming mechs, customizable loadouts with tons of different units? Sounds like a dream game.\n\nThe question is, is it a realistic dream? I think it is.\n\nLet me start by saying AirMech has a very small playerbase right now compared to other Free to Play online games. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the game is still fun when played versus bots.\n\nThe game has a bit of Pay to Win by having items be unlocked exclusively with in-game currency that can be purchase with real-life money, but the in-game currency is acquired at a pretty decent amount so you'll find yourself being able to buy two or three new units or a new pilot. The only thing you'll really find yourself grinding for is the ability to customize a mech, but all of the mechs are available at start to play as, just not to customize.\n\nThe gameplay is fun and fast paced and heavily strategy based. Based on which mech you use you'll find yourself playing the game quite differently. My personal favorite mech is the UFO, which has so little outgoing damage and so little damage reduction I don't even bother shooting most of the time. The fact that the games are exclusively 2v2 is understandable given the small playerbase, but it makes for a less action packed game than it could be for people who play as more strategy heavy mechs than pew pew heavy mechs.\n\nThe game has a lot of growing room, and I see it becoming very big if the game adjusts some of its.... Commercialistic... Aspects.\n\nI personally don't mind that the game has a lot of things on sale, but it's a LOT of things on sale, and you're going to be flooded with them the moment you load up the game. If I want to buy something, I will, I promise, but honestly having giant ads for your in-game items flash before my eyes right when I load the game makes me not want to buy them.\n\nThe game is being constantly updated, though it seems that a lot of the updates are for things you have to buy. For a game in Beta, I feel this needs to be changed. Yeah, I understand that you need to put food on the table, but you're in the business of making a video game, which is also the business of making money. If your game is fun, and people enjoy it, the players will come and the money will flow in.\n\nAll in all, as it stands, I give AirMech a nice little 7/10. It's above average. It has a lot of potential it needs to expand on, and it has a bit of a money hungry attitude it needs to tone down on. Gameplay wise it's a fantastic Free to Play game that rewards the player for being good at the game. If you're considering giving it a try, there's no reason not to.","January 20, 2014","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's like a technological, futuristic, and much much more user friendly version of DOTA 2. It's free, but actually free. Not the sort of free where you can download it but have to buy in-game content to have any fun at all. This is legitimately free. You can buy almost everything with in-game credits (though you can also buy those with real money, of course), and it's not impossible to get your hands on the actual cash-based currency that lets you buy special stuff. I'll be honest, ♥♥♥♥♥ing enough in game money to buy the quality items takes a long time, but the game is really fun, so you don't mind. Also, there's a nice achievement system thatalways gives you something to do.

At first I thought to myself this game maybe a "Pay-to-peice" of you know what, but I gave it a try anyway. The game is really ADDICTING! Sure if you want to use the cool stuff you just need to buy one thing, but after that, the game only seems to get better with that "Since-of-accomplishment" feeling! And I still feel (Honest opinion, not fact) that it is fair to buy a $9.99 USD "UPGRADE", reason being is because they pretty much give you access to almost everything except "Diamonds".

Each player(s) starts with a base.\nDestroying the enemy base wins the game. Each base will produce units that automatically begin to roll towards the enemy base. On your way you will try to capture and hold neutral bases, that in return will allow you to produce more units in a shorter time.\n\nThe units can't be controlled by the player. Instead you control a transport plane. Your job is to pick up one or more of these units and deploy them either in a defensive slot near your base for defense, or drop them on the battle-field as reenforcements for your offense.\n\nTo support your units on the ground you may either try to shoot down the enemy's plane to keep him from deploying more troops. Or you land your craft, which then transforms into a "mech"-style tank that can shoot enemy ground troops.\n\nIf you are shot down, you suffer a time penalty, during which you have to wait before being allowed to re-enter the battle-field.\n\nAs you win battles, you will be able to purchase other types of planes with special abilities and better ground units. However, the longer you play, the longer it will take until you reach the next level or can afford the next upgrade.\nThis means that the game can get very repetitive, unless you invest real money to avoid the grinding.\nTo be clear: this is NOT pay to win. Apart from optical goodies, you can get all items in the game without paying. BUT! It will take a long, long time to accumulate the amount of money you need to purchase the "big guns".\n\nSo if you are looking for a face-paced, action tower-defense style of game with strategic elements and a grain of "transformers" and don't mind to do a bit of grinding, then this game is for you.\nIf instead you are looking for either a "mech-warrior" style simulation game with some strategy or a full-scale strategy game with mechs, then look elsewhere.","October 12, 2014","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Just_A_Normal_Toaster/recommended/206500/","Just_A_Normal_Toaster","Done with Overwatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Just_A_Normal_Toaster/","36 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLet's just start this off with one simple statement: This game is a joke.\n\nNow, although this game does have a good amount of content and can be replayed (Though only if you're with a few friends and can find some fun tactics to try) somewhat for at least 50 or 60 hours. After that and you're probably going to want to invest in their "VIP system..." Which just seems to be ever so slowly growing so that this game is less and less of a free to play and more of a, "Free to try some of the content." game.\n\nI started playing this game quite some time ago, and although I can't say I'm the most experienced player, I have had the chance of seeing this game grow, change, and (d)evolve. It started as a rather unique game with a good basis and a lot of potential. Updates rolled through occasionally bringing new content, maps, features, etc. and the community grew rather well. And much like many games, everything changed  when the fire nation attacked  when development seemed to slow to a halt. Now the game was much more cosmetic driven and it seemed to simply be held together by a few regular players, the newbies that flowed in at a constant rate, and the seasonal items- which was really the only "content" added.\n\nFrom here the game shifted... as I said, from a nice game that some people would play and toss, having had their fun, and others would find much joy into something much worse. It became a pay-gate game. Slowly features left, like the market listings and ability to sell your  oh so valuable  loot for a few measly diamonds (The in-game common currency that has a oh so familiar real world transaction rate) or market chats, etc.. There were levels of VIP too, bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. Obviously paying more meant you got a better rank (Going up as appeared), allowing you to gain wonderful bonuses, like increased funds from games, more experience, and access to useful features like the market.\n\nSo where does this leave us? Well, ever so intelligent me gave in after putting what felt like many, many hours into the game and having a lot of fun, though the magic was lost and I was losing interest, I decided I would put down my fifteen dollars during the winter sale and get silver VIP and unlock these cool features. Originally I was on the fence, but upon seeing that  not only  would I get diamonds, market chat, market listings, better plots (A cheap gimmick that deserves to be in a mobile game, though that's not what I'm here to discuss.) among other things, and the cherry on top, the tipping point for my decision, an incredible all access map editor and creator. So I slapped my money down and felt good about my purchase.\n\nI worked on and off on multiple maps, finally ending up with one super map that I intended to be incredible. A map that would rival any other map that had been created by devs or fans in size and quality... With this new dream map in mind I set off to create it, working as much as possible, when time allowed. During this game I noticed more and more things shift towards this "VIP" experience and saw more and more things fall off the "F2P" model.\n\nAnd here we are, as of writing this, I logged into Airmech fully excited to work on my map now that school finals were over and I could return to my glorious map that was nearing completion. I clicked towards the map make, paused deciding first to check the store as I noticed an update had released recently changing and adding some things. Nothing new, not at least in the  real  content section. Nothing that added gameplay value or made me want to terribly come back. But none the less I checked and curiously noticed that there was a plot item for map creation (That I had already purchased) to my surprise and it said I needed Diamond VIP for access. Concerned I navigated over to the map creation section and  bam  it was gone. The only thing I cared about in this utterly trash game that the devs seem to be driving into the ground for the sole goal of making money, no matter how much it screws their fanbase (Who has already payed for this game, though they- I - Probably shouldn't have.) over.\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't expect anything out of this game. Don't pay money unless you are 100%, absolutely, without a doubt, convinced that you will be playing this game for ages, putting down hours on hours consistently. Make sure you are willing to pay for diamond VIP and that you are willing to have everything you  already  payed for taken away at a moments notice. If not, then sure play the game but keep in mind what I have said and you'll do find. That's all then, it's a mediocre game with failed potential and a dying fan base and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers.\n\n\n-----------------------------------\nNote: if you do intend to respond to this, please do the follwing.\n\n1. Make sure you have put at least 50-60+ hours into the game, have played all airmechs, all gamemodes, bought VIP, and interacted with the community.\n2. Do it respectfully, don't get upset because you are a diehard fan for this game (Or ignorant player who has just recently gotten into it and is still under the "New Game Syndrom")\n3. Make sure you have actually read what I've said... It may sound stupid but, really.  READ IT OR DONT REPLY\n4. Have a good day'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost forgot to mention... It is still better than Archeblade.","June 3","false","92.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The community, though little, is one of the most generous I've seen, giving other players the chance to win gems(in-game paid currency used for skins and such) and a pretty hands on support team.

Airmech not only strives to do this for all the former Sega fans of the game Herzog Zwei, it does such an unbelievable job at it that will just leave you stunned.\n\nTaking bits from the 'modern' game styles of Tower defenses with MOBAs and reaching into the RTS bucket a time or two, Airmech is an amazing mashup of each of these genres to find a fast paced birds-eye RTS style game while giving much of the focus to your 'hero' unit, the Airmech.  There isn't a lot new about the overall gameplay from the delicious early 90's game that was Herzog Zwei, but everything has had such loving attention to detail paid to it that it is obvious the designers spent as much time in the Sega world as I did, if not more!  The one new thing that IS included?  Oh so much customizaton.  Exactly what every online game needs.\n\nIn the original game, you were limited to one type of army and one 'airmech' (they look JUST like the default skin even, they just weren't called that then)  Carbon has just gone NUTS with this in the best way possible.  There are now numerous Airmech variants, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages over other Airmechs both through leveled abilities and innate stat differences.  Each variant posseses numerous skins offering no other bonuses other than the look of them, but are worth paying a few bucks to get if you are enjoying yourself.  I don't spend a lot of money on Free to Play games but Carbon has earned money out of me a few times simply by putting a smile on my face.\n\nArmy customization is through the roof as well.  In the source material there were like 9 or so units I believe?   Now there are a ton of options, I would say easily 3 to 4x that (I haven't taken the time to count but it's a lot).  If you have decided to support the project with your dollars you can even get special colors for your army or even use special units that are locked out of being used against people that don't have them, but CAN benefit them if you are playing Co-op.\n\nThere are a few different types of game modes.  They've recently added a challenges that I haven't really done much with and at launch will be adding a 'prime' campaign that I'm definitely eyeballing.  Currently you can go solo or co-op against AI opponents or engage in 1v1 to up to 3v3 PVP.\n\nIt would definitely be great to see more of these added in but I have to imagine this takes a lot of coding so I'd guess they are doing their best in this department, when I first found this game Prime wasn't a thing and the challenges were VERY barebones, so they definitely keep pushing more content in, just hope it keeps coming.  I'd throw maps in here as well.  While there are plenty of maps to keep you entertained for awhile, the nature of the game makes it quickly become VERY easy to exploit the AI, or just steamroll them on accident a lot of times.\n\nSo, should you play this game?  Well...  It's free, so yes.  You've got nothing to lose except the time it takes to try it out.  If it isn't for you, uninstall it and never come back, but more than likely you'll find yourself logging on repeatedly and tossing them some money so that you can really get the full experience.","January 4, 2014","true","111.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's fewer quantity of playable characters than on other mobas and it can take quite a while to find a pvp match if you just join the queue(and when I say quite a while I mean it).\nWith that said,it is a mix of strategy and moba,which is a pretty cool innovation. The community, though little, is one of the most generous I've seen, giving other players the chance to win gems(in-game paid currency used for skins and such) and a pretty hands on support team. If you like moba genre and, for one reason or another,you are tired of lol & dota you'll probably enjoy this game.","January 6, 2015","true","31.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Build tanks and robots to fight for you, or fight yourself. This game is what I would call a true Real-Time strategy, because not only do you have to manage your resources/units, you must also manage your Health, and energy. Really hectic gameplay makes for some interesting moments. Cosmetic items really make your mech your own. Only problem is servers like to go down a bit, but it's no real problem.

It has a great variety of troops to choose from and different mechs/pilots with special buffs to up your game. Another great feature is there is no penalty for leaving games (at least that i know of). Now for times like when you have an emergency or when your parents tell you turn it off you can still come back the next day and everything will be fine. There are a few cons though, one of them i majorly didnt like is there is no way of changing your mech type othere than a coupe classes and spending real money on skins. Speaking of real money, the whole game is very PTW. If you don't know what PTW means it means pay to win. It is very PTW because the game expects you to spend money on skins and in game currency to get that one new special item/buff you really want. Not only is there a lot of things that cost realmoney but they are also very overpriced. I guess that doesn't matter today because all games are now very expensiver and take a lot of devoting real tme and money to get good or better. Anyways i would definitly recommend checking out airmech it is a great game other than the PTW things.","March 25, 2014","true","14.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madsy/recommended/206500/","madsy","Madsy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madsy/","75 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAirMech is a top-down Action real-time strategy game with its main concepts influenced by the old Herzog Zwei from 1989\n\nBefore giving a review of the game, I should elaborate on my taste in games as the reviewer. I like new ideas and new game mechanics, I prefer old classic strategy games over modern ones and I'm not very fond of the Free-to-play model in principle. I have been playing strategy games since the original Herzog Zwei in the very early 90s.\n\nGame description  Core Gameplay Your play and control one of various mechs, where the default one is a jet fighter. What they all have in common is that the unit is directly controlled by you as in an arcade game. Compared to a "normal" RTS game, this unit acts as your mouse cursor.\nWhen you are in the air as a jet/chinook/saucer you can pick up units, fly them off somewhere and place them where you want, as well as giving units different commands such as "hold ground" and "attack enemy base".\nWhen you transform into a mech you walk on the ground, can fire on ground targets and generally support your troops with different mech abilities.\nYou start with a home base where you can build units. The goal of the main game mode is to destroy the opponents base. In addition to the starting bases, the maps have outposts which can be taken over to earn resources faster, in addition to act as recharge stations when your mech's health gets low or when you run out of energy.\nThe game matches are played 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3 either in player-vs-player or player-vs-AI. A survival mode similar to tower-defense games lets up to 4 players defend a base against several incoming waves of enemy units.\nSince your opponent will be constantly fighting you over additional outposts as well as harassing your main base and your units, the game can become very hectic and fast-paced. The times you win, it feels very rewarding.\n\nCustomization OptionsThe game has tons of customization options. Where Herzog Zwei had around 8 different units, AirMech has over 60 units. However, you have to select a subset of these for your avatar character before starting a match, and only 8 different units can be in your build menu at any time. In addition, your mech can be enhanced by various upgrades.\nThere are also cosmetic upgrades to make your mech and units stand out from the rest. Which brings us to..\n\nFree-to-play profit modelThe game is free of charge, which in of itself is amazing. I'm also happy to say that there aren't any balancing issues due to the profit model; the game is not "pay2win" as some people accuse free-to-play games of being. The company earns money on people buying the in-game currencies, which is used to buy units, mechs and upgrades in the game store. If you don't use your hard-earned cash however, you get credits for just playing the game and meeting daylies. If you are familiar with Blizzards Hearthstone, you know basically how it works. Someone who spend money on the game save themselves from maybe 4-6 hours of gameplay, which is the time you would need to get the basic units. Other than that, the things for sale are mostly cosmetics, such as a tank skin with a gothic look.\n\nThe Good\nI love the main game mechanic! In RTS games such as Starcraft, when you get over a certain skill level, the game is won based on who can dish out the most commands to the most units in the least amount of time, all else being equal.\nIn AirMech the mouse-clicking fest doesn't happen because unit commands are given via your mech, and your mech is limited in how fast it can fly around. It gives people with not-so-great reflexes (hello me!) a fighting chance, but still requires skill. It's just that AirMech requires a different skillset than RTSes like Starcraft and Command & Conquer. It's an RTS, but also an arcade game.\n\nThe graphics style in the game is superb, and my modest computer from 2011 plays the game at a decent framerate. I know that a lot of gamers like flashy graphics, and the more realistic games look the better. If you're one of those, you won't find that here. But AirMech doesn't try to look realistic. Rather, the developers went for a more cartoon-like look with very colorful scenes. I prefer game graphics which decides for a certain art style, rather than games that adds all sorts of HDR lighting, blooming and depth-of-field.\n\nThe whole game interface is really well made. Menus are sharp and descriptive. After logging in, you'll see a chat window where you can talk to other players, find opponents or people to play coop with. The community seems very friendly towards beginners.\n\nThe Bad\nThis is mostly nitpicking, however there are some things that goes against my personal preferences.\n\nWhile the overall artistic style of the game is great, some of the abilities or unit skins you can get are just strangely out of place graphics-wise. The "boomer" unit can be made to look like a Creeper from Minecraft. That doesn't fit the game at all! The overall style of the game is a kind of post-apocalyptic future where mechs control the earth, but here you have creepers in the battlefield, and mech abilities in the form of witches on brooms? If other players like it, that's fine by me, but it would be nice to be able to turn it off or be able to choose default skins/models for all players that are more consistent.\n\nAs the game is in the free-to-play category, the developer/publisher needs to make money somehow. And that brings me to annoying attention-grabbing and nagging. Whenever I start the game and enter the main menu / lobby, the game nags me to give referral links to friends (basically free promotion) and get in-game currency in return. In addition, the game highlights the store icon and your current credits sometimes, and hints you to spend your credits and buy more in subtle and not so subtle ways. This is incredibly annoying! I'd like to focus on playing the game, not get nagged on to spend money and treated like a walking wallet. Even if a game is free to play, it should be possible to turn off all the stuff which distracts you from the main game.\nNote that the actual game matches are void of this problem. It's only in the main menu/lobby.\n\nHerzog Zwei which this game is influenced by was great because of its game mechanics and its simplicity. But the free-to-play model is incompatible with simplicity. The end result is that the number of units and items in AirMech is inflated quite a bit. It might sounds strange that more choice and customization could be considered a bad thing, but here it is. The game would be vastly better by less choice and complexity, but I suppose the publisher would be making less money that way.\n\nVerdict\nDespite the nitpicking above, AirMech is incredibly fun to play. And it has something for everyone, whether you are a hardcore competitive RTS player or a casual gamer. Play PvP ranked if you enjoy competitive play, or team up with other players against the AI otherwise.\nYou can use mouse+keyboard or an Xbox 360 joypad, and getting into a match takes seconds. A match lasts for between 10 and 20 minutes, so you have time to play in your lunch break if that's your thing. The strategy and tactics in the game can be incredibly deep depending on the experience of the players, and no two rounds are the same.\nThe game's presentation suffers a bit from the free-to-play market model and it would be nice to be able to pay once to get rid of the "give me more money!" nagging, but nothing is perfect. And again, the game does *not* give paying players any advantage.\n\nI give AirMech 7.5 out of 10. It's free! At least install it and give it a try.","May 23, 2015","true","24.4"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Fast-paced and easy to pick up, but it's not very popular unfortunately. At most, there will be 2-3 games up at once and lobby hosts can be very picky with who joins a game. I understand that they probably want to play with friends, but if that's the case, set up a private lobby instead of kicking non-friends as soon as they join the server.\n\nMatch-making is also a problem, as you get paired up with people either below or out of your skill range. Very rarely will I find someone who's right around my level, but that's if I even find someone else. Match-making can take long periods of time, and I always find myself going to the custom game lobby before Match-making finds someone, since I actually have a chance at joining a game there.\n\nOne thing I do find rather irritating is the fact that there are some Diamonds (In-game premium currency) that I don't have access to unless I upgrade to Silver status. I've already unlocked them, I just can't use them, which really doesn't make much sense to me. Seeing the Diamonds I COULD have by upgrading makes me feel gipped by the game. What sense does it make to lock something that someone has legitimately earned? I understand that as a F2P game, certain restrictions must be put in place to ensure that a profit is made, but plenty of people buy enough Diamonds to do more than sustain this game. Other than that, I have no qualms about the Cash Shop/premium currency.","June 18, 2014","true","19.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is my first foray into this genre, so I don't really have much to compare it to, aside from RTS's I've played in the past. It's kind of RTS meets transformers. Where it's different from RTS is that you have full control of your "hero" but either no or only some control over the units you build, depending on what kind of unit it is. For example, you can tell your tank to attack the nearest enemy outpost, or hold position, but you can't really issue complex orders in the middle of a fight (good luck getting your units to fall back - about all you can do is pick them up and carry them to safety - maybe)\nA few complaints: The controls are a bit awkward and I had to spend some time switching my keybinds around until I got them to where I felt comfortable with them. The game also restricts some of its content and ingame currency unless you pay for it (unlocking Silver VIP status or better) and without that, the game can feel kind of grindy. Completing 'quests' helps, but even with that, you might need to do 10 matches just to unlock one new unit or piece of equipment. I also ran into some UI glitches that caused the chat to disappear and become unrecoverable, and sometimes UI elements persist in the background behind other UI elements when they shouldn't.\nOverall, though, I do recommend it, which is saying something if you consider that this genre isn't something I thought I'd be interested in.","October 30, 2014","true","141.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A weak MOBA with a big stress on strategy, like starcraft, you have units, but like a typical MOBA, you only control one hero or "mech". You have to control your own units and "micro manage" them by carrying them places or giving them orders. With plenty of units and new patches coming out all the time, balance is always maintained.

I personally had to familiarize myself with DoTA for much longer time than with this game. It plays as the usual MOBA game, but with a twist: you gain control of one hero, and there's also the usual creep, but not only that, you can build units to support you in battle. And along the way you have to gain control of neutral and enemy buildings, where you could take your units from there (just like RTS/RTC game), before you crush the enemy's HQ.\n\nThere's almost no pay to win elements in this game. Most of the stuff are buyable with in-game cash, even the cosmetics. There are a few units and additional bonus which may need a bit grinding though. The maps are enough to pose different challenges.\n\nI can't find any big downside in this game except maybe for the AI difficulties. The first three difficulties ("Trainer", "Basic", "Beginner") are really enjoyable, but beyond that it could be extremely frustrating. Especially if they start to spam you with tanks. That's almost unstoppable.\n\n8.5/10. Play this game with friends or random strangers.

This is an Action-RTS game. Do battle on a map for control, supply and position. You can give your units orders like defend, attack, follow - but you don't micro manage them. Instead you control (WASD) the airmech commander unit which is much more powerful than the typical unit on the map. You can support your troops in battle from either land or the air in your transforming mech. In air mode you can pick-up and transport units quickly around the map for well-timed assaults on control points. Airmechs come into each battle with a load-out which determines the units they can build, their abilities, various buffs - as well as cosmetic aspects. If you are playing multiplayer 2v2 or more, then you'll have other airmech teammates and you can synergize your choice of airmech and loadout. Some airmechs are better suited for fast build times, or defensive strategies, while others are better utilized by being in the thick of combat.\n\nThis game has an excellent tutorial and introduces the game with solo-played challenges which teach the basic concepts then allows you to practice them until your confident enough to start playing any number of the standard game modes on offer. Solo or coop survival mode where you attempt to survive waves of enemy units, or 2v2, 3v3 multiplayer vs other players. The various modes keep the game fun both for casual players who want to play coop and more competitive players who want match-making ranked competitve play.","September 28, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I personally had to familiarize myself with DoTA for much longer time than with this game. It plays as the usual MOBA game, but with a twist: you gain control of one hero, and there's also the usual creep, but not only that, you can build units to support you in battle. And along the way you have to gain control of neutral and enemy buildings, where you could take your units from there (just like RTS/RTC game), before you crush the enemy's HQ.\n\nThere's almost no pay to win elements in this game. Most of the stuff are buyable with in-game cash, even the cosmetics. There are a few units and additional bonus which may need a bit grinding though. The maps are enough to pose different challenges.\n\nI can't find any big downside in this game except maybe for the AI difficulties. The first three difficulties ("Trainer", "Basic", "Beginner") are really enjoyable, but beyond that it could be extremely frustrating. Especially if they start to spam you with tanks. That's almost unstoppable.\n\n8.5/10. Play this game with friends or random strangers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somazx/recommended/206500/","somazx","Somazx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somazx/","158 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAwesome game. This is an Action-RTS game. Do battle on a map for control, supply and position. You can give your units orders like defend, attack, follow - but you don't micro manage them. Instead you control (WASD) the airmech commander unit which is much more powerful than the typical unit on the map. You can support your troops in battle from either land or the air in your transforming mech. In air mode you can pick-up and transport units quickly around the map for well-timed assaults on control points. Airmechs come into each battle with a load-out which determines the units they can build, their abilities, various buffs - as well as cosmetic aspects. If you are playing multiplayer 2v2 or more, then you'll have other airmech teammates and you can synergize your choice of airmech and loadout. Some airmechs are better suited for fast build times, or defensive strategies, while others are better utilized by being in the thick of combat.\n\nThis game has an excellent tutorial and introduces the game with solo-played challenges which teach the basic concepts then allows you to practice them until your confident enough to start playing any number of the standard game modes on offer. Solo or coop survival mode where you attempt to survive waves of enemy units, or 2v2, 3v3 multiplayer vs other players. The various modes keep the game fun both for casual players who want to play coop and more competitive players who want match-making ranked competitve play.","September 28, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

But, that isn't what happens. I get put up against diamond 2s and they build like 20 tanks in the first minute or so, and destroy us, due to them having the stronger army. Carbon games, PLEASE FIX!!!\nWhen I try to go into ultimate (Explained earlier) I just have to wait for about 10 minutes and then my teammate leaves so it exits the queue. There isn't ANYONE on ultimate MM. (Maybe make it easier to unlock diamonds and maybe easier to collect them. This also needs a solution to it.)\nQuite laggy gameplay and bad selection of server location. - Due to the lack of people of MM all around, you either get put with someone foreign on your team (2v2 or 3v3) Or everyone is English and your server is somewhere like Texas (I am from England) We need a way to get MORE people on MM, maybe link it up to basecamp to change both things? Also, if I build an army of Jackals or Buckies I get an FPS drop, not just  small one but a MASSIVE one. Normally like 60 fps down to 5-10 fps which really frustrates me. It slows down combat for everyone (It effects ((Normally)) Everyone in the server) And this is annoying. Is there a solution? And for the last problem, when someone has bad internet the WHOLE game lags (Links in with the server location problem) and the players never normally tend to leave, we either have to prompt them to leave or they just don't leave. Could this have a fix?\n\nThis is my overview of the game, still a very fun game with fast paced, (Most of the time) fun, action-packed gameplay which can lead to a lot of fun\n\nMy ratings of this game - 7/10\n\nHope my review was useful to you ;)","April 5, 2015","true","49.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryancooper228/recommended/206500/","ryancooper228","iPPi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryancooper228/","3 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSorry for my English. Again. I am not from English-speaking country.\n\nThis game is good, it has low system requirements, interesting gameplay and it sounds wierd ('cause MOBA became from RTS), but it is something like MOBA+RTS+Shooter (not an FPS, but the shooter). It has all the best things from all the genres, but the worst things from F2P games. But let start my review from positive sides of this game, and there are a lot of it.\n\nYou know, it is something medium between MOBA and RTS: you control only one unit and you can't control others (like in MOBA), but you can buy units and tell 'em what do they need to do (like in RTS). But the part from shooting is the best - now you don't need to target the unit, you just need to shoot in them! The gameplay is not just about destroying towers & base, I mean you need to destroy the base, but you don't need to destroy towers (here they are actually other little bases), but you need to capture them. From the beginning, you theese bases are holden by neutral units, that are actually hard to destroy. There are a lot of maps to play so you will never be bored. And the best part of this game is main units you controll. They are actually transformers: flying like planes and walking robots. They have different skills and they're really balanced. Also, there are no roles and no artefacts so it is not so good part of this game but it still fun. There are not so much of mechs, you unlock it by leveling up and buying, but they're really cheap, so basicly leveling up is enough. You get a lot of kudos (in-game money in this games) and exp for even a match with bots, there are also VIP to get a double kudos n' exp, but it is useless. There are units to buy (also by leveling up and a little of kudos), characters (unlocking them is exactly the same) and some other features. But there are also one more way than VIP to get more kudos with exp and it's free: just build some structures in non-match base in game menu and you will get some % of extra currency or a wheat field where you can sell wheat for kudos (so you don't need to be nerd to unlock something in this game). Match continues 20-40 minutes, but I think it isn't the limit or minimum. But now let's talk about one con, but the big one.\n\nThe game has got some kinda imbalance between novice, nerd and donater. There are diamond currency and it is real money currency, but you can get something from missions. Good thing is that mechs you can purchase by theese diamonds are only the skins which aren't better than free (the only thing you can purchase 'em with any level). But there are "ultimate" units and characters that haven't got level limit and they are powerfuller than free ones, but good thing is that they are excluded from PvP. Next is upgrades and they're free, but it's like arts, but not buyable in the match, you buy 'em in game, so that means that nerds will win novices 'cause first ones have better mechs. But even after this, balance in this game isn't as ♥♥♥♥ed up as in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MOBAs like Prime World or Panzar.\n\nI reccomend this game, one of the best MOBAs in the MOBA market, and yes, I think it's MOBA, not the RTS 'cause you control one unit, you can't build buildings, etc. It's MOBA with parts of RTS and Shooter. Enjoy it!","June 25, 2015","true","6.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","6","12","2","1"

I can play solo and I used to be able to play multiplayer but after one of the updates I was not able to. I meet the recommended hardware, is there something that I can do to fix this?","May 23","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
