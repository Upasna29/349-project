Dooon’t do it.\nFirst, they’re treating you like brainless cattle. It’s NOT free DLC, you’re downloading nothing new. All it does is let you start with a level 35 Time Tracer (Very low level) and give you a bunch of TIMED cashshop goodies (They pretend that’s worth money, hence the ‘free’ part). That. Is. All. Nothing new or unique.\nYou’re not cattle to be milked like KOG loves to believe, don’t fall for this ‘free DLC’ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\nAnd back to the review….\n\nFirst - Cashshop.\n\n\nIt's a free to play, sure, but it fails absolutely miserably at handling its cashshop. Power, not convenience, is for sale. Just take a look at what you'll want for a new character:\n\nWant to use more than 4 skills at once? 9$\nDitto items? 6$\nWant a costume (greatly boosts PVP stats)? Anywhere from 15-32$\nDo you want skill notes (greatly boosts skills)? 1.50$ a piece, can use up to 6\nWant an overpowered pet? 4$\nWant an overpowered mount? 23$\n\nThat's 60$ for a huge power boost nearly unobtainable ingame. In other words, apparently this game is so awesome, a single character should cost more than the price of a triple A game (Surprise, it’s not). That’s not even touching the hundreds of dollars you can spend going for overpowered +11 equipment\nThat alone should be giving you bad vibes, but to continue…\n\n\nSecond - Balance.\n\n\nShort version: There is none.\n\nLong version: Sigh…\n\nKOG's idea of new content is a new, more broken character. That way people will go "AWESOME" and pay $60+ in previously mentioned cashshop for their new broken character.\nAnd then they release another, even more broken character, and repeat the loop for infinite money. New dungeons? Nope, halt the update and add another new character instead.\n\nLet's look at the most recent, broken example, Add, or specifically the new Diabolic Esper class coming out:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLeq6Lo2HEY (30 second clip, implore you to take a gander)\nYes, that is Crimson Avenger, -second- newest class, dying in 30 seconds while DiE literally just runs around spamming missiles. Mind you, this is SSS rank play, top tier stuff. Welcome to Elsword PVP.\n\nIgnore the most broken cheapskate for a second, as even the basic combos are horribly unbalanced. Eve in general is incapable of looping without spamming Tesla Shock, the worst KD reset skill in the game. Ara and Add have built in infinite loops with their basic attacks. If they catch you once, you will die without manabreak. That means anytime they catch you, it's a guaranteed -100 MP for you, while Eve will end up doing scratch damage while -giving- you MP. It’s completely unbalanced at the most -basic- level, before even delving into class skills and powers.\n\nSo if KOG can’t even balance the most basic and -important- aspect of a fighting game, what hope is there for the rest of the game?\n\n\nThird - Combat.\n\n\nSo there's PVE and PVP. Originally both took skill to be good at....\nNot anymore.\nWith the last dungeon revamps we had ages ago, everything's been buffed with fake difficulty. Bosses ignore combos with length super armor while hitting chunks of your HP off, or get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like flat out invincibility/smaller hitboxes.\nEven the normal mobs are getting stoic counters to break free from your combos. Because ♥♥♥♥, what is this, a fighting/combo game? Oh, it is? Well oops.\nThe end result is that the game is becoming more and more like a maplefest game. No skill, just button mashing and potion chugging, spam your highest damage move whenever the CD is off.\n\nSo what about PVP?\n\nYou can probably guess how this’ll go.\nAs should be evident with the cashshop and balance sections, PVP is ♥♥♥♥. Doesn’t matter how skilled you are, if you picked the wrong class/don’t have as much cashshop as everyone else, you lose. They only need to be slightly competent to floor you.\n\nBut assuming you're equal in everything, class, cashshop, how's it go then?\nLaughably. This is a terrible excuse of a fighting game.\n\n99% of PVP is catching, which is hitting your opponent first so you can combo them. The actual combos are brainless, you memorize a small string of button inputs and that's it. You repeat that forever and you know PVP. Catching is the only hard part, which naturally gives the edge to the players with more range. Guess who everyone picks.\n\nLook at Add, newest character. Starts match with DP mode, spams nearly undodgable homing shot, teleports into you for combo, never runs out of DP unless he kills you enough. Nothing counters it.\n\nBut even ignoring Add, this game is still a joke compared to other fighting games. There’s almost zero strategy involved beyond picking the right character.\n\n\nFourth - Content\n\n\nThis is probably the final nail in the coffin for me. KOG literally couldn't give less of a ♥♥♥♥ of what the players want. We haven't had real new content in almost a year now.\nOur current endgame is summed up in 5 dungeons, the Secrets. You only run them to construct a Secret set, which takes at most a month. Then you have nothing else to do but PVP. Congrats, you won Elsword.\nThis is yet another ploy to make you make another character and spend even more on cashshop, but considering how boring it gets to play the same things over and over… that won't last long.\n\nYou could try to argue PVP is the heart of the game, but as I've tried to make clear, it’s terrible. Even the rebalances are jokes; Season 3 revamped a total of TWO out of 26 classes, and completely ignored (and even NERFED) classes desperately in need of it, like Code: Nemesis again.\n\nNot to mention, again, the complete lack of cashshop separation from power. Expecting nerfs to costumes, +11 weapons, skill notes, etc? What is this, a balanced F2P?\n\nSo yeah, PVP is the ‘heart’ of Elsword, and it’s rotten to the core.\n\n\nFifth - Regional differences\n\n\nI mentioned them a bit already, but it goes a lot deeper. If you play Elsword in KR, it might actually be somewhat better overall. Anywhere else? ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\nSo what does NA get? Summed up in a few words: Cashshop, inflated prices, worthless trinkets.\n\nMeanwhile KR gets so many EXP boosting events, crossover events, fun little stuff like Bingo events, even a month long Harmony festival with cashshop rewards/costumes/exp boost/stamina boost/free healing items/and more all rolled into event that's still going on. We don't get anything like that anymore.\n\nSo tack that on top of the already increased EXP requirements and bland general events.\n\nBut wait, they also purposely punish our region for no reason!\nIn KR, Henir and Secret revamps came with new level 70 sets, could trade your old 60 sets for them.\nIn NA, all the work you put in the 60s? Do it again. Make 70s from scratch with the vastly inferior 60s in dungeons designed for much stronger equipment.\n\nWe can't even get voice acting yet, we're still using KR's voice overs, while even the UK managed to get English dubbing (Which was horrible in quality because KOG isn’t going to waste money when they could pocket it).\n\nOur GMs do make an effort to have silly mini-events, but they're powerless against the greedy grubby hands of KOG.\n\nAnd this is all because the MMO market anywhere else aside from KR is pretty slim. KOG can tell us to eat ♥♥♥♥ and we have to, because we don't have many other options.\nWhich is why I eagerly await DFO's return, KOG is about to burn their own ship with this ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\n------------------\n\nHopefully you’ve got the gist of that and now understand what’s wrong with Elsword. Pleeeease avoid it, KOG doesn’t deserve a penny from you. Tell your friends, too, don’t let them waste time or money on this crap.\n\nThere are far better ways to spend your time and money than this game.","October 7, 2014","false","123.8"," 1,048 of 1,199 people (87%) found this review helpful 104 people found this review funny","87","048","1","104","102"

You can travel through most of the game without cash, but if you wish to succeed at all in it, you will need cash. $10 for a repair scroll. $13 for a marriage (Note, the site only manages increments of 5, 10, 20 and 100 so anything odd numbered requires a larger than your desire purchase), as well as other 'interesting' payment methods. Such as if you wish to expedite your Hyper Skill work and just buy it, it's 550 KC, however, they don't dabble in "pay what you need", so you need to pay 10 just for that 550.\n\nThe PVP is by far one of the worst pvp systems I have ever had the sheer disgust of dealing with. It's almost 100% completely gear based. Someone with a highly reinforced weapon and armor 'will' plow through you with little effort. If it's not their gear ending your chances, it's their character. The balancing in this game only grows worse and worse each big update. Chung, the gun user, when built right, now has almost infinite Super Armor capabilities. Making him impossible to combo against. AND THEN IF THOSE 2 aren't stopping you, it's lag. Opponents randomly walking out of your combos, dropping away from them, with 0 care in the world.\n\nMP Breaking is a method to escape combos, but there have been many times where I simply saw them walk away from my attack, no Super Armor, not even any damage, just walked away. It's so infuriating seeing hours of progress in your pvp rank get taken down in 1 to 2 matches NOT because you were outclassed, NOT because you were outskilled, but because the person had stronger gear than you, or lagged, or simply was better than the class you used.\n\nThe only redeeming thing this game has is it's community. You can literally trust a stranger with 2 Billion ED (Ingame currnecy) and actually receive your item you payed for. The reason why that's an issue is you can only trade in increments of 700 million, so you will end up accepting a trade twice to 3 times over giving them all your money before you receive your item. They could so easily run away, but they don't, they're trustworthy. Everyone there is kind, enjoyable, very, very weeaboo not gonna lie. But at least they were cool.\n\nThe gameplay itself is still enjoyable in dungeon runs, it's fast, fluid action slashing and destroying enemies. And that's enjoyable, or at least it is to me, for 3 level cap characters. But once you get that far, you have to start grinding and start paying to keep up, needing to buy Ores and garbage to make your weapon stronger so you can actually excel at your class. And that just wont happen if you run free the entire time.\n\nWith that said, I can't recommend this game to users that want an mmo they can really dive into. This game is worth a look at best, but barely worth truly getting into for the long run. The Pay to Win model becomes all the more apparent as you level up and the sense of feeling cheated out of victory as well as simply too weak (even when you have end-game gear) is a feeling games like this should not generate within their players. It's a sense of worthlessness that you can't ignore, and when you've reached such a feeling, you start questioning if the game is really worth your time, rather than if it's worth your time to achieve the stronger gear that you were just clobbered with.\n\n","September 18, 2014","false","237.5"," 280 of 359 people (78%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","78","280","359","13","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/merciligh/recommended/237310/","merciligh","Merciligh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/merciligh/","10 products in account","Let me list my problems with this game.\n\nThere is a significant pay-to-win issue in the game in the form of costumes and gear enhancements. Contrary to a relatively "fair" free to play game model, Elsword's costumes (for a reason which is easily fathomable) give stats and overall power. As a result, this results in those who are willing to pay real cash having a significant advantage over individuals who do not. More to the point, Equipment enhancements, due to their nature of increasing stats via an increasing percentage per enhancement level (From a 1% stat increase at +1, 15% stat increase at +6~9 and a +30% stat increase at +9~11) results in a ridiculous power disparity between high-enhancement weapon wielders and low-enhancement weapon wielders. With the present average enhancement at +7, people at +8 and higher will have a 15~100% base attack stat advantage in comparison to the average player.\n\nThe PvP system of this game, contrary to most individual opinions, is genuinely well-thought out and generally well made. This game's PvP is dependent on your ability to 'catch'- i.e., hitstun your opponent and land a series of hits in the form of combos, and repeat. Hence, it is potentially possible for any character at any level to defeat any character and any level, as long as one's skill level is higher than the other. On a clean, basic flowchart, I find this highly appealing.\n\nHowever, there are several significant issues with this PvP system.\nFirst and foremost, there is a signfiicant balancing issue between the many classes and characters you can choose in the game, particularly with the more recently released character/classes. For those interested in said balance issues the PvP forums are the place to go.\nSecondly, due to this game's frame rate being directly tied to your computer's performance level (i.e. general graphics and CPU power) and because your frame rate is directly tied to your character's input response speed (e.g. Attack/Movement/Jump speed) anyone with an inferior computing experience compared to the opponent will find themselves severely disadvantaged due to their character's slower response time- hence opening up far more opportunities for your opponent to catch you whilst simultaneously reducing your number of opportunities to catch you opponent.\nThirdly, this game's matching system is a peer-to-peer system, which directly connects your IP to the opponent's IP. As I am an Australian and this game is based in America, naturally most of my opponents are individuals across the whole pacific ocean, resulting in horrible latency. This results in delayed response times as hits and actions on your screen may not register on the opponent's screen, as is the same for your opponent to you as well. This results in a horrible PvP experience for both parties.\nFinally and most importantly, the above enhancement system comes into play in PvP as well. As in PvP, you can be matched up with anybody and anyone regardless of character level/class/equipment enhancement level, anyone with equipment of lower enhancement level will find themselves highly disadvantaged in many matches due to their equipment being inferior to their opponent's.  As a result, the gear discrepancy between players becomes ridiculously high as one progresses up in PvP rank, as eventually, regardless of their skill level they will find it extremely difficult to defeat their opponents who have far superior equipment. For instance, a +7 weapon wielder may find themselves hitting for 3-digit damage on their opponents whilst they hit back for over 4~5 digit damage.\n\nHence, the PvP system at its present state is highly undesirable to play without significantly increasing your character's power level, which in turn requires (and will inevitably require) real cash investment, i.e. as the common phrase is, it will require you to buy power.\n\nOn the flip-side of the coin,the PvE system of this game serves as several dungeons in which you clear stages after stages of monsters, culminating to a generally difficult last-stage boss. However, after a while these bosses become walkovers, and it becomes boring to grind these after a while. Challenges exist in the form of solo Secret Dungeons and Henir Challenge modes. Although these are indeed interesting, they harshly punish you for failing in them as the former consumes rare items for entry, and the latter will only provide rewards for entry only once (i.e. if you enter and die in the first few stages, you won't be able to get any rewards for the rest of the day). This also results in significant time and power investment.\n\nWould I recommend this game? No. really, no. It's genuinely fun, yes. However, that's only once you reach the end game and you have sufficiently invested enough time and money in order to establish your character's power and place in the Elsword world, as I have done so. I genuinely do not recommend this game for anyone with insufficient time or money on their hands.","November 6, 2014","false","373.8"," 281 of 376 people (75%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","75","281","376","15","15"

You know, do something to kill time until other obligations spring up or if I can't decide what other game I want to play instead.   I treated this game as a snack; something to enjoy in the meantime before the real meal comes up.\nAt first I was pretty happy.  It was nice, colorful, and simple.  And despite the atrociously generic characters (little girl with a big sword, little loli mage, blonde haired elf archer, etc), I still enjoyed playing with them for a while.\nAnd then it hit me like an angry flaming brick wall;  You're not allowed to even have simple fun unless you're willing to shell out the cash.\n"It's free to play!", you exclaim. "Of course they'll charge you for SOMETHING."\nFair enough.  But I shouldn't have to pay money out for an extra skill slot.  Little things the game throws at me shouldn't require extra cash when I never wanted the item in the first place.  And all the base, free costumes are incredibly ugly... which is to incentivize players into paying more money for their costumes.\nAnd on that note; the Pay to Win.   If ANYONE tells you that isn't true just know that they're lying.   Those stat increases are insane!  It doesn't matter how well you are at the game because little Johnny Morebucks can buy an insta-kill weapon and BOOM! You're dead.  No glory, no skill.  Just a whiny kid with his daddy's money.\nTypically I wouldn't mind handing over a few bucks for a neat costume.  But this is insane.   The stuff you can buy with real cash are incredibly overpriced and needlessly over-powered for no adequately explained reason.  And after a certain point it's almost as if the game expects you to start throwing money away just so you can progress.  That's insane.\n\nGames like this are an embarrassment.  If you want to make a Free to Play game, then go for it.  You want to charge a little for a neat outfit or an accessory?  By all means.  But don't charge $40+ for a single complete outfit and then jack up the buffs to where you become unto a God.   I know what it means to have fun; it means to feel as though you've accomplished something.  That YOU became powerful on your OWN merits.  Not by buying it.\n\nAnd this all doesn't even address the grind.  Dear god almighty the grind.  "Oh, an MMO that makes you grind? How absurd!"  I know, this isn't anything new to MMO's.   But this makes a grind and turns it into a tedious, required chore where the end never comes into view.  It's just over and over whacking the same bland enemies with the same bland backdrop with the same obnoxiously bland sound effects to the track of some bland, forgettable pseuo-electro pop nonesense.\n\nI'm also ignoring the whole "weeaboo" thing but... hey, it's Elsword.  Young anime girl with unnatural hair weilding a big sword.  What did you expect?\n\nNo, I don't reccommend this game.  It should be pushed aside.  This sort of practice should not be encouraged.  And I don't care how much money you borrow from your family/friends, or how much you earn to justify spending it on this.  You're paying for numbers and pixel clothes.   That's depressing.","August 9, 2015","false","39.9"," 205 of 276 people (74%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","74","205","276","38","8"

Fast paced side-scrolling hack and slash action complemented with an amazing variety of character classes, each with their own unique specialties that make them stand out, beautifully rendered background environments (since this is a side scroller) almost like an amazing artist just painted the whole thing with awesomeness and HOLY FREAKIN HELL!!!!... THE MUSIC IN MANY PARTS OF THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE!!!!... I Just have some minor issues with this game... Stamina bar and tedious last class change quests and skill unlock quests... ( DAMN YOU AND YOUR ERRANDS CAMILLA!!!! DX)... Overall I would REALLY recommend this game to anyone that loves either good locales, good music, or some of the best side-scrolling gameplay Ive seen in my life... If you feel tempted to try, me and my Deadly Chaser will see ya in glorious PvP! (unless you face a Dimension Witch or an Infinity sword were against those either you dodge everything or you're freakin screwed... or just put a giant amount of unexpected burst on them like I do XD)","November 25, 2013","true","280.7"," 153 of 206 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","153","206","2","7"

It's really fun and all, but it's absolutely lacking in endgame material. Endgame gear is a matter of "Do this single dungeon 50 times." as well as a general lack of leeway for unique setups in pvp. With the recent updates. I might as well note a few of my observations as well as widely accepted information from my peers who also play the game.\n\nPVP is much more centered around stats than skills, and money is a key part of this process. Players without premium currency will find it practically impossible to hit over +8 "Enhancement" (The process of increasing equipment stats by a given % which increases in increments each level, from 3% increments to up to 40% at the moment) for their precious endgame gear unless they don't mind it resetting, or breaking (Which at that rate, you must spend premium currency to FIX the item.)\n\nThe max enhancement level is +12, which allows players spending cash to be infinitely stronger than those without it, seeing a 135% higher difference in stats (This is actual data as well.) To increase enhancement levels without risk of reset or breaking, players must spend a small fortune on "Fluorite ore" and premium currency ore that makes enhancement far easier. Players are known to spend up to 600$ just to get one item to +12.\n\nOnto gameplay, in PVE enemies are usually just the same AI with a different model, and eventually you notice a very obvious pattern in the story that'd feel about as repetitive as Bravely Default was with its 5 worlds mechanic. Early game is actually the most unique part of Elsword, which is rather ironic with how bleak it quickly gets. In later areas, the main reason anyone desires to replay dungeons is to obtain ED, which is spent in the economy. The newest area, Elysion, is the only exception to this. Sadly, this is only for players who are 5 levels from the cap and finished a long story quest around the other regions with their usual "Copy-Paste" style of gameplay.\n\nWith economy on Elsword, everything is horrendously unbalanced. Every run in the final dungeon gives you around, 300,000 Currency. On the other hand, any costume piece will go from 40 to 600 Million currency. This doesn't include Ice Burner sets, KoG's gacha for Elsword. These sets, which are usually priced at horrendous levels, can cost over a billion for the accessories, and 5-6 billion for the sets. I wish I was joking about this but unfortunately as a player of over 4 years, I can't. To go back on this, that'd be doing about....20,000 runs to obtain an Ice Burner set. Endgame equipment is also given the same treatment, usually being about 1-2.5bil for the full sets.\n\nCombos aren't nearly as fulfilling as they seem at first as you may quickly realize that the best combos are the shortest. In pvp, the meta is known for "Loops" an infinite combo where the player simply inputs the same command over and over to ensure you cannot be knocked down. With the +12 mechanic for players who can afford its insane costs, pvp is simply a matter of who loops who first, and whether or not they've the money to kill the other quickly with the loop.\n\nFor a beginner, Elsword is a really fun game, and I in no way condemn anyone for trying it. But the game's flaws are cleverly hidden until you go further in, and the results as I can personally say, are as unpleasant as it gets. Elsword was much more exciting years back, when it had the playability and focus more on skill, than the money you spent on making your gear too strong. Originally, the top enhancement level was in fact +8. I noticed the game started making a turn in the wrong direction for long-time players the moment +11 became the new max, and +12 later. It no longer had nearly as high replayability.\n\nMy advice is that if you are looking to save money for an MMO you'll be playing for a long time, even spending on a pay to play game like FFXIV would be far more profitable than playing Elsword to get to the end.","May 5","false","2.0"," 63 of 75 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","63","75","5","0"

I've been on board since Raven's release and it's been quite a roller coaster in terms of my opinion of this game up until now.\n\nElsword is a great game, don't get me wrong. The mechanics are solid, I haven't run into many glitches, and the general feeling of the game when playing is unique. Being a 2D fighting game, scrolling is to expected when it comes to dungeons. Elsword does it very well. Each dungeon has its own theme and get more fun as the game progresses. With the addition of fields, players have an alternative to obtaining EXP. PvP itself also rewards players with EXP, but in much smaller doses. Skills are flashy, each playable character feels unique, and overall, the game is pretty easy to pick up.\n\nHowever, some key things set this game back two steps whenever it advances one. Mechanics are solid but latency issues and ping play a large factor in being able to PvP well. More often than not, I find myself dying to lag than skill, even when the other person is better anyway. I've won my share of lag matches, and I always feel bad when a genuinely good player gets beaten because of the awkward connection. Dungeons rehash a lot of the mobs. Certain effects can bolster and change a mob, but for the most part, it just takes more time to kill it. Speaking of which, every dungeon's boss save for the secret dungeons' are extremely easy to kill. It takes two to four 200-300mp skills to down most of the bosses. Some dungeons are too long, especially toward levels 30-40, and feel as though they are just intended to burn precious stamina. Killing mobs in fields also costs stamina, but that was very minor in my opinion. The PvP matchup system runs by what seems to be just ranks. This can cause a lot of problems as some high level players who have already attained high ranks lose matches on purpose and "derank" in order to climb back up and farm for AP, which is currency only obtained through PvP. Skills themselves are not a problem, but more often than not, I find myself using little to no skills on the trash mobs throughout the dungeon. Leveling up in general to get more skills is a pain, especially that dreaded moment when the next quest is level locked and grinding is the only option. Grinding itself isn't that hard, but the community is not very friendly to grinders. The community itself is mediocre. Rudeness and trolls are abound in PvP, loners and the occassional leech can be found in PvE. Another non-game related problem besides the community is the economy. Massive prices, ED being extremely worthless, buying one's way to win through the cash shop etc. The cash shop itself is Pay2Win, and even though it's possible to overcome that (skill notebook, bank perks), it's extremely inconvinient and requires tons more effort. Some features that give the game a very different feel and the player a much easier time are locked down permanently without cash (skill slot B, pets).\n\nOf course Elsword is a good GAME. That's about all it has going for it. Everything that contributes to the game other than the actual mechanics kind of break it. If you can put up with all that as long as I have, then kudos. Elsword is enjoyable, but only so much so.","July 2, 2014","false","104.3"," 265 of 391 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","265","391","0","18"

You've got nothing to lose since it's free to play. Go.\n\nWait... you're still here? Still not too sure about it, huh? So, you wanna hear more? Fair enough. Well, this is a game that does "Free to Play" the right way. Yessir. There's no locked content or anything that would prevent you from enjoying the game unless you'd pay. There's an item store where you can buy cool costumes for your character with real money, but they DON'T affect the gameplay since they're just costumes. Y'know, cosmetics. But you're gonna want them, because the game is a hell of a lot of fun and you care about the way your character looks in a fun game. Especially when it's not a FPS. I mean, look at TF2 for instance. If you have hats in TF2, then you're definitely gonna want to have some cosmetics in this game, because you can actually see your character at all times here.\n\nNow, you might be asking yourself, "yeah but what if I don't want to pay real money, will I still look decent?" Well my dear reader, you'll be glad to hear that yes, you will be able to have your own style and look decent even if you don't pay. Sure, you'll be less fancy or less over-the-top, but there's a lot of different clothes that you can drop, and another cool thing about this game is that you can enchant and give attributes to your items. This means that your old dusty shirt you love and cherish can actually be good for a lot longer than you might imagine. You get quite a reasonable amount of in-game money by simply playing the game normally, so you can actually enhance your equipment pretty easily and it's fun to experiment with that.\n\nWhat else is there to say? Wait, you're right, I haven't even talked about the actual combat yet. Well, this game uses a basic melee combo system and a spell system that uses Mana. Your Mana regenerates faster as you do melee combos. So what you do is you combine your melee combos with your spells and it's super fun and satisfying. There are many classes to choose from, so that makes the game very replayable. Oh, and the surprisingly great music adds a lot to the intense, fast-paced combat.\n\nAll in all, this is quite frankly one of the best free to play games I've played in a long time.\n\nI'd give it an 8.5 out of 10.","July 25, 2013","true","164.1"," 64 of 81 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","64","81","0","1"

It never gets any better. PvP is so broken it might as well be "hit your head against the wall" simulator. Sure, you can Try to win, but guess who you're fighting against: Mr. Op-bottoms and his fat stacks of cash! His money will shield him as he stunlocks you against a wall and kills you in one combo, doesn't that sound like fun? (I'm looking directly at you, Lu/Ciel and the new VIP system.) The various characters are quite nice, very varied. But every single one of them has a skill or combo that just screams, "Screw you, I don't care how good you are, you're dead." Dungeons so tedious and repetitive you'll think pulling your teeth out is a better time. I GET IT the level designs are beautiful, very very true!

Unlike other games, Elsword locks both four skill slots off, and extra pages in the skill tree, both of which are nearly 20$ apiece. The game also does indeed have a problem with class balancing, and the developers refuse to listen to the american playerbase for opinions regarding buffs/nerfs, listening only to the korean playerbase. This game is indeed fun, but that will only last at most a few weeks before you start to become bored with the game or play with friends. If you do indeed like grinding, forced halting of your gaming due to the stamina system that is implemented, and severe balancing issues, than this is for you. Otherwise, i say skip out on Elsword, and look for some other game.","December 8, 2014","false","873.1"," 106 of 155 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","106","155","3","0"

Right in the beginning, you choose from a decently large variety of characters. To be honest, it's not really that great until you hit level 15 and can start your job change. A job change basically means you get more skills, a new look, and better stats. There are, however, both pros and cons to this game which I will also review.\n\nPros:> Lots of potential time to put into it\n> Variety in characters\n> Different playstyle, even in just one character\n> PvP can be based more off of strategy than pure strength\n> Lots of people - lots of friends\n> Community is, for the most part, pretty good. Better than most.\n\nCons:> CAN be pay to win (The game's gold currency (ED) can be used to buy items that normally cost real money)\n> Trading could possibly make you lose your ED\n> Broken economy\n> Unbalanced characters (Though, there are character rebalances every so often)\n> PvPers who rage when they lose\n\nFinal verdict:It's a great game and definitely worth a try. Try not to be too discouraged by it being a bit slow in pace up until level 15 (which you could easily get in 30 minutes) and the broken economy. The variety in characters and even variety within each character should keep you busy for a LONG time.

The game did get better but I’m still giving it thumbs down cause of many reasons still which ill list but I’ll start off with the positive things about this game and also don’t give me saying I haven’t play the game long enough when I have over 300 hours and if I include the non-steam version, that would be over 5,000 of hours.\n\nPros\n\n-Game can handle any pc and don’t need any decent PC(Almost weak as a web browser game).\n\n-Doesn’t take up much space\n\n-Great with friends and the dungeons and back ground designs are beautiful.\n\n-Lots of beautiful costumes and outfits to try out.\n\n-Always doing updates.\n\n-You can be a Loli and do amazing skills\n\nCons\n\n-Events are starting to become helpful and amazing but it require you to be on elsword everday and  stay on for hours just to get some event items and you can not miss any days of logging in or else you will have the buy the tickets or items to make up for it and if u can't buy to make up for it, guess what, **** you!,you should have been on elsword everday!(that what it feels like).All the events quest ever be about is just asking u you to do repetitive dungeon’s they make you do over and over again daily until u get numbers of items to turn in to Ariel or whoever to get your free outfit or what not, for me doesn’t feel very rewarding and a waste of time, it’s like working at a restaurant to cook and serve back and forth for 8 hours straight and only get 5$ for it.Also the events really aim to be cash grab, just discounts and asking for your money.\n\n-Its P2W, while people on the right says it’s not and people on the left say it is, imo it is P2W regardless of what the people say that’s not P2W(Don’t give me that BS about grinding when its impossible in NA).\n\n-Unnecessary items to buy, skill slot B(never heard of a mmo that charge you money that require you to use  more slots just so you can use more skills), 2nd skill tree and limited inventory space(can't be earn for free except rarely in events), its very low, same for bank slot(again, only can be earn with money) and finally no free perm mount except rarely in events of course.\n\n-Pvp,still bad after all these years, still gear base and p2w and there no real skills needed in the game, it’s all about attacking your opponents and not letting them move an inch. You might think it be like a soul calibur side scrolled anime style cause of the fighting and weapons use in side scrolled with the anime theme. But ohhh no, it’s far from it. The game is 90% spam and there barely any fair game play in it, this why everyone always going on about calling you a noob when you beat them and giving you the same feel to call them a noob when you get beat by them, it’s never a “gg” really in elsword. Pvp in the system have the worse reputation of them all and best stay away from, with that skill slot b, 2nd skill tree  and finally and most of all, the gear from henrir and SD duns with +7 scrolls or higher, you won’t be able to pull off unbreakable combos and have a decent fair tree of pve and pvp and to be able to stand pvp a bit.\n\n-To repetitive, repeating the duns over and over for everything in this game, as for your normal story quest, it so lazy how they use it, it just do it on normal,hard,very hard,very hard twice or more and then it slap you right in the face.Do the same dungoen you already did like 4-5 times again but 10-25 more  or so just to level up, depend on the level rate your at and not just that but also quest, job change, skill quest and item drops are annoying and can cause you to get bored of the game very quickly.\n\n\n-Lack of content,to many updates and add-ons about  pets, mounts and most of all way to many costumes and  ib's and not enough of real content(mind as well call it "weeaboo dresssem up simulator forever"). The real contents don't happen until 2-3 months, after all it just be pointless events doing the time, other then that its just useless updates that ask for your money. Lets be honest here, the game is more about power and greed and all about trying to get rare things to show off so there not much to do in the game, you dun, you field and pvp that’s it, sure a lot of mmo’s does the same, but most tend to be very creative at their questing(for example, you deliver and travel and gather flowers or what not to complete a quest, elsword you just kill mobs 24/7)\n\n-The game is way to expensive and have terrible economy,the item mall and in game board(33$ for a full perm outfit for one char, 23$ for a perm mount again just for one char per account and take over hundreds of dollers to get a full ib set with op stats to help you dominate pvp. This game require crazy amount of money.) I could never afford those things  on the game board and the cash shop and what worse is, they starting to sell things over 1bil ED when back then ib weapon would be just 600 mil ED, same for skill slot B, when back then you could have gotten it for 600 kching and get it for 400 kching, now the only option is 900 kching.\n\n-Lack of true customization, Can you start off customizing? No you can't, you start  looking like a clone with other beginners  in the game .The game go on and on about how you can customize like crazy when you can’t, you have to paid and worse is… its over price. 3$ to change my eyes, 7$ to change my pose and another 3$ just to see a 2 second skill cun-in scene just doesn’t make any sense at all, they should be free and brought with ED or obtain by quest.\n\nI can go on and with more cons since I have more but thats just the gif of it, most likely when they have the new characters 2nd job comes out, a few weeks later ill most likely leave the game for a while again and since Blade and Soul on its way, most likely Elsword will be dead to me for good, now don’t get me wrong, elsword is a good game, especially for indie gamers and anime lovers that like small and simple games but I’m a person that expect more work and creativity in it and prefer bigger and more open world mmo’s.\n\nOverall: Do I recommend this game? Unless you don't mind repeating duns multiple times which you can get bored of very easily, got friends willing to spare time in this game with you, you can afford the overprice items and can stand the huge months of grinding, (Super OP RGN meaning its all about the drop rate in this game to get far) and gear just to get pieces from the in-game board and most of all got friends to help and trade with. Also don’t mind lame events that’s most of the time cash grab and most events require you to  come on elsword every day to get free stuff WHICH cases that you will have a high chance to not have the time to come on every day and finally can stand and ignore the salty p2w pvp bs..then your fine, elsword is for you, especially if your into anime, small lack of content and only want the strong concepts of the game and most of all an indie kind of gamer but other than that, I don’t recommend this game, to be fair i'm done with Nexon games in genreal. Not even excited for the up coming game closers which is another kog game, feel like just going to follow along another kog game mistake like elsword, more excited for bigger up coming mmos so you’re better off playing better free to play titles, such as warframe or the upcoming game Blade and Soul or phantasy star online 2 and more.\n\n\nUpdate: Now that Blade and soul is here i have no desire to have this game in my mind even, anymore and also excited for Black Desert online as well.\n\nFinal verdict: 5/10-Just A Mix And Average Game.","July 13, 2015","false","369.0"," 87 of 127 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","87","127","5","1"

This is a pay to win game no matter how you look at it. I tried to not pay a single penny into this game and It was practicaly impossible to first get any good items, raise any in game money, and anything else that you would want an need in a game. You want in game money? Well then you have to buy an iceburner with real money but it costs a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of money. 1 dollar for one icrburner and your chances of getting anything good is very low. In fact most of the things in this game are very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly low chances of getting anything good. So if you are willing to fork over tons of money to get overpriced items that you may or may not have the chance to get than by all means come and play. I mean its over 23 dollars for one stupid costume set in the game, that is freaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly overpriced. Also when you finally get an item worth selling from an iceburner, mainly costume pieces, by that time you get that and try to sell it, KOG has already thrown out a new event that makes your item worth nothing, because they added new stuff. Then when you got to dismantle the item because you cant even sell it anymore you get one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little item that is worth nothing even though you have spend tons of money trying to get tha one damn item, its such a bad tradeoff and screws you over huge time. This game will only find ways to screw you over, never have had a moment in this game where they have not tried to screw me over out of my money. So please skip this game and find games that wont take your money like these greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will.\nAlso there support sucks so bad, they will try anything to not help you and worm their way out of admiting that their game has bugs. I bought something and it never showed up in my inventory, so I created a support ticket and even had the proof that I had tried to buy the item and never showed up. All they did was say well there is no proof that you bought the item in our records so we arent even going to try to help you and look further into it. What ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t support team that is. So if you play this game, dont expect any help from the support team they will just worm their way out of admitting their game has faults and in the end leave you screwed.\nOverall this is a fun game but the people who made it are money greedy people, who will try to do any little thing to try to suck up money out of you. I have spent over 1000 hours on this game (most of the hours of this game was before this game was put onto steam) and all I have seen is them finding more and more ways to suck us dry of money. Its pathetic. Save yourself money and dont bother with this game.","May 4","false","644.4"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","31","40","2","8"

This review is long. Like, REALLY long. Do not click on this review unless you're willing to read a lot.\nThe gist:\nThis game is a trap. Stay away while you still can.\n\nIntro:\nIf there's anything one should gather from my rather long playtime for this game, it's that this game is rather addicting. Don't get me wrong. There ARE some enjoyable bits in this game. I wouldn't have come back to this game after six months and rediscovered all the bad bits if there wasn't. But, yes, there are quite a few problems I have with this game that keep me from recommending it to anyone (or at least, anyone that  I'd respect  I know).\n\nGameplay (PvE):\nIf you've seen any of the trailers or read any other reviews for this game, you probably already know what the gameplay is like. You're at the leftmost side of a level, you go right, hitting anything that looks at you funny until they fall over, until you reach the end and get teleported to another, seemingly identical level. Well, maybe I shouldn't be so harsh. Some of the levels DO seem like they're set up rather well and the combat is rather engrossing. Armed with combos, special attacks, and super attacks (I know there aren't any moves called that, but whatever), the player can very easilly feel like he's a badass fighter in an action anime, running/flying around the screen hitting/slicing badies until finally blowing them up with a large explosion.\n\nUntil, of course, they realize the enemies are collectively about as threatening as a one-legged spider with brain damage. The enemies in this game are either legally blind or incredibly stupid because they only seem to acknowledge your presence when you're either right next to them or hitting them across their stupid heads. And when they do notice you, they perform their telegraphed attack once before either forgeting about you or walking slowly towards you. The exception to this behavior is the boss enemies, who have a better grasp on the idea of focussing on players but feel they need to more obviously telegraph their attacks to be fair.\n\nAgain, the levels do seem like they're well-made, so these problems with the enemies wouldn't seem so bad if one needed to visit each level only once. Is that the case? No. Levels will have to be visited three, and later even four, times before being allowed to the next one. And that's even assuming you're the right level, because otherwise the game just tells you to level up more, and since levelling up is so tedious, especially at higher levels, it won't be long before you're so familiar with levels that you could draw them on paper while blindfolded (this is assuming you're following the story, of course, and not just playing levels, but since levelling up takes so much grinding, especially later in the game, you might as well).\n\nWhat also doesn't help with this tedium is the music. I've read some reviews where people have praised the soundtrack, calling it beautiful and epic and the like. And I have to say, yes, the music is rather wonderful...... for the first fifteen seconds anyways, because after that it just loops over again. Even the most beautiful tune in the world is going to sound annoying and overplayed after looping it every half a minute. Add this to the already grating grind settup and what would just be a minor annoyance to my ears suddenly turns into the music I hear in my nightmares.\n\nOf course, a good way to break this tedium would be to play the levels in a party. Yes, this is an MMO after all, and thus you're given the option to play levels with up to three other players. In fact, the game actually encourages it (In a way that I'm not too fond of, but it honestly doesn't get me angry enough to talk about it.). Unfortunately, the only form of communication that the game provides is a text chat, which does not go well with the fast-paced action prevalent in the gameplay. As a result, playing in a party can usually be equated to a giant cluster♥♥♥♥ of screams, explosions, and screen shaking.\n\nOverall, I'd give the whole PvE aspect of the game a miss.\n\nGameplay (PvP):\nNow, in my opinion, this is where the game truly shines. One of the problems I had with PvE was the non-threatening enemies, and replacing them with one enemy who can actually outsmart you certainly fixes that. And the fast-paced gameplay is right at home in this mode, creating moments where the difference between victory and defeat lies within a nanosecond. I've had matches where both I and, I suspect at least, my opponent were sweating bullets throughout. Matches where I felt like I had to actually contact them and thank them for providing me with such an amazing fight.\n\nWhat's unfortunate is that I can count the amount of matches like this that I've actually had in Elsword on one hand. It seems like for every opponent pitted against me at the same level as me, there were about fifty who were forty levels below me and fifty who were forty levels above me. This can be blamed on Elsword's rather bad matchmaking system.\n\nSo, to summarize on actual gameplay, look somewhere else.\n\nCommunity:\nI remember a review talking about how the people in this game are really friendly and playing in the community is fun and how it's so easy to make friends in this game. I can only assume that they were an extrovert and thus able to make friends anywhere else, because, for an introvert such as myself, the majority of the people that I seemed to get acquainted with were people that I wanted to reach through the computer screen and punch in the nose. But maybe I'm wrong on this. Maybe all those annoying players were just a small fraction of the player populace, and the majority of the players on this game are nice, decent individuals who don't get upset when you tell them that no, you don't want to friend them just because you said something remotely funny while in a level. But if that's the case, then it certainly isn't obvious to me.\n\nManagement:\nWhile I don't seem to agree with them on some things, the creators behind this game do seem to take care of it. Bugs and issues are practically nonexistent, and updates are rather frequent. They also hold events for their players. No matter what day, there's always some kind of event going on in Elsword (which, to me, totally undermines the whole POINT of an event, but whatever.), where any player online during it can get a special item only available then and there.\n\nIt just feels as though they're focussed on all the wrong things. It seems like, for every update made to balance the game or fix issues, there's about twenty updates made to add a new costume to the in-game store.\n\nOh, yes, they have an in-game store, where things in it cost real money. Some items even have additional stat increases when worn. Now, debate can be made over whether or not these increases have any real impact on gameplay, but frankly, it's the fact that there are stat increases in the first place that pisses me off. There's more to be said about this feature, but I feel plenty of people have already harped on it enough that anything I say here would just be a rehash.\n\nClosing:\nThis isn't a game meant to bring in new players. This is a game meant to keep old members mindly interested and not think about any other way they could be spending their time, turning the grindfest that is its gameplay into a reasonable sacrifice for getting this totally new accessory only available on a certain day and then doing the same exact thing the very next day. It becomes very easy for one to become addicted to the promise that is a free accessory. The only reason that I got out when I did was because I realized what was happening.\n\nBut others are not so lucky. Even today, there are those stuck in this endless loop with little hope for escape. Do not join them. Stay away while you can.","September 18, 2014","false","277.9"," 71 of 110 people (65%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","65","71","110","17","4"

This game is not casual at all xD it will suck your life out, and you will feel good about it. Of course that would be if you're able to spend some cash on it. I'll write some pros and cons of this game that, as an ex-player of Elsword, noticed in all my in-game experience.\n\nPros:\n1. Nice move combinations.\n2. Epic music and visual detail.\n3. A VERY social game. Most of the community (non-pvp community) is not toxic, and if you play for a while you'll notice that to be successful in this game, you need to be on a guild, which is not a hard thing to do.\n4. Constant updates and twitching.\n5. Great mod system. (GMs are great)\n6. Every character has something different to offer. They are fun to play for a while. You can have several characters to play with, with different gameplay and spells. You will be amazed, really.\n7. PvP system is fun. There's 1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 matches. You can even prepare your own fights against your friends.\n8. Item trade system is great.\n9. You can chat with everyone in the area you're currently are.\n\nCons:\n1. The player economy is broken. There's an in-game market were players can sell their items and let me tell you, everyone is greedy as hell, and inflation is constant in there. Wanna have in-game money? You need to either spend days farming for loot to sell or spend some bucks in the game.\n2. The best items in the game require you to either play months to obtain them or to invest cash. And by the way, the very best items in the game are obtained through some sort of "raffle system": you buy "ice burners" and "fossil readers" that will randomly give you items. Most of them are trash, And yes, some dollars are required for this.\n3. Very linear gameplay. Can get boring after a while.\n4. Some characters are unbalanced. Just play a PvP against an Add. Or let yourself get combo'ed by a LK.\n5. Item space is A JOKE. Space is very limited, and yes, you will get LOTS of valuable items through the game. Want some more space? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\n6. Personal Message system was programmed by monkeys. You'll learn that whispering is the way to go.\n7. Stamina. You'll see that it is a great issue during your Elsword journey. There's never enough stamina xD. But there's Unlimited stamina on weekends (yay)\n8. Freaking low drop rate for loot. Like, really low.\n9. THAT PVP COMMUNITY DOE.\n\nWanna be the very best? Like no one ever was? Wanna Crit like a champ? Spend cash and get those OP stats you search for.\nJokes aside, you'll enjoy this game for a while, if you don't mind either having "below average" stats for a while or spending some $$$ on the game.

It clearly has some form of enoyable charm that keeps players coming back for more, with the fast paced crazy combat, intense PVP action and overall captivating competitive gameplay, the game clearly can keep a player entised for hours on end, for weeks and weeks to come.\n\nThough there is a cash-shop that holds a lot of important things, such as slot expansions and inventory space. The game is not only playable without having to pay a single thing. You're more than likely going to find yourself being able to justify making purchases within the game, as you'll play it that often and enjoy it that much.","March 20, 2014","true","894.0"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","32","43","0","0"

I have played this game since Closed Beta in 2011. I partially did not want to write this review but I grew tired of the bullcrap this game has gone through.\n\nThe game was fun.\n\nFast forward to 2015.\n\nI'll be honest. Grand Chase can't even compare to the amount of pay to win that this game has, and that says a lot. In order to stand a chance in PVP, you have to sacrifice money. Costumes have stats in them and are extremely overpriced. A full set can cost you between $25-$31.\n\nEveryone and their cats in SSS ranks will have a Ring of Fury(aka Ring of Free Combo) which costs $8, and/or a +11 weapon, which there is little way of upgrading it that far without forking the money over. Magic Necklaces are a necessity, which again, costs $8. Don't even bother with Ice Burner sets because that's a huge money sink too. PVP Skill only applies when both sides spend enough money, and have a good connection with each other.\n\nElsword's Netcode is even worse than Grand Chase, as it's very common to run into players who lag, ignore your hitstuns and walk out of your combos. Even back then when the game was only  restricted to only NA and Oceanic players, lag was still common in PVP.\n\nThe events we had lately are either cash shop, or just useless. There is little incentive to even bother participating in many of them. Especially our current halloween event where there is no way to maximize the rewards you get without cashing.\n\nCharacter balance is atrocious. It seems that KOG doesn't care about character balance, as each character that gets released gets more and more overpowered. Older characters, from Elsword to Eve(except for Runeslayer) will have a very hard time standing a chance against newer characters in PVP. They take very long to get to balancing anyway.\n\nI'll admit, I did cash, but not frequently. But until KoG steps up their ♥♥♥♥, I'm not going to give them my money. And the more they force me to cash, the less incentive I have to play the game anymore.\n\nDon't get me wrong though. Elsword is still a great game, and very fun as long as you play casually and not take the game seriously. PVP is an absolute joke for reasons stated above, so just ♥♥♥♥ around. If you want to play a bit seriously, there are some guilds out there that have developed the competitive scene, but like I said, you're going to have a hard time standing a chance in PVP without spending some money.\n\nFor those who want to play Elsword, be warned that you're going to have to use the cash shop at some point in your gameplay. It's a necessity.","October 24, 2015","false","238.2"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","33","45","0","1"

A very good game that has jrpg elements in terms of gameplay. Can be a bit repetitive at times but overall it is a great game!\n\nNow after playing more than 400 hours, I can say that even though i have spent money on the game, there are still many other factors such as skill that play an even bigger role than pay to win issues. As much as having a super cool costume, magic necklace, and a ring are important, they are NOT essential in the game. As much as there are people that spend so much money that it is impossible to beat them, the chances of facing those people are pretty low. There are a few cash issues invluding the ridiculous item mall prices but again, you dont have to pay to win. Its just nice and I still believe that Elsword is a great fast-paced side-scrolling MMORPG.\n\nGameplay:\nGameplay wise, the dungeons are nice and graphically designed beautifully with a mix of monsters for each different major area. Each dungeon has unique bosses that are designed to not be total walkovers. Even though once you get to level 55+ there is a bit of level grinding, with the constant addition and promotion of new characters, Elsword is a very good game. On the other hand, the PvP community is practically brain-dead with sore losers and rage quitters. Since you have to pay $9 for extra skill slots for the in game (you start with 4 and the skill slot gives you 4 more) they constantly call you a spammer. Also, level difference plays a huge role as players level 65+ often have end game equipment that makes others look like they dont do damage.\n\n\nOverall : 9/10","January 12, 2014","true","644.9"," 38 of 54 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","38","54","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/237310/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","OVERVIEW\n\nElsword is a 2.5D MMORPG and is developed & published by KOG Studios. These company were known for making a really great 2D MMORPG called Grand Chase. This game is basically a spiritual successor to Grand Chase. Despite this game being received critically acclaim by both critics & users,the game suffer from repetitive gameplay and incoherent decisions that the developer made lately such as dungeon no longer drop skill notes and you are force to spend real money to buy it. However does that mean you should avoid this game at all cost ? Not really because this game has it own unique charm put into it. The server is heavily populated ever since the released of Add.\n\nGAMEPLAY : 7/10\n\nWhen you start off the game. Instead of being able to create your own character,you are given to choose a gender class locked character. While this might be a downside for some people,each of this character have a unique background story and different fighthing style.\n\nTutorial doesn't explain much about the game so you left wondering what you must do.\n\nThere is two ways you can level up,either by training in field or by playing dungeon with a bunch of random people.\n\nLevel progression is balanced ( you gain don't level extremely fast and slow at the same times ) but skills progression is extremely linear.\n\nTree skills only offer 2 different sets of skills and optional skills for you to choose,once you choose one,you cannot choose the others unless by using skills resets.\n\nAnother downside would be you only can assign 4 skills & 3 items slots so if you want to expand them then you need to buy using real cash in the item mall.\n\nQuest can be extremely repetitive at times since it required you to play the same dungeon 3-5 times in order to progress to the next one.\n\nAnother problem would be the stamina bar. If you stamina bar reach zero,you couldn't get any experience points killing monster or completing dungeons. I don't understand why the developer think would be a great idea to implement a facebook like game stamina feature. You only get unlimited stamina during Friday-Sunday.\n\nIn-game money is not difficult to earn considering the item drop rate is quite high and you able to sell off you items in market too ( you don't need to use real cash to set up your own market ).\n\nGRAPHICS : 9/10\n\nBy far one of the best 2.5D MMO graphics i seen so far.\n\nThe gorgeous artstyle and colorful visual impressed me a lot. Both the character and the monster design look pretty appealing.\n\nOne minor issue i have is that there is seem to be a lot of clipping issue when you fully equip your character with rediculous gear especially when two people stand together at the same area.\n\nDifferent segment of area have different looks on them so you won't have to see the same repeatable background.\n\nThe interface is quite ok i would say while at the same time it a clutter mess and you can't customize it.\n\nAUDIO : 9/10\n\nWide variety of soundtrack you going to listen as you progress far into the game. A lot of them sound like it comes from the Tales series game which had outstanding soundtrack.\n\nAll the characters in the game have Korean voice ( only when you initiate a skill they will speak in English ) and they are all well done ( some of the voice suite very well to all the playable characters ).\n\nSome of the sound effects sometimes acts weird if you heard multiple critical strike.\n\nNevertheless i don't have much problem with the sound effects.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 7/10\n\nFor a 2.5D games,it provide sufficient fun for you to keep playing.\n\nThere is PvE,PvP,marriage,guild system as well as raid boss. Even though you level your character to max level,you can still choose to play other characters to test his/her ability & playstyle.\n\nThere is a new event every 2-4 weeks depending on how the current event last.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 8/10\n\nWhile the gameplay fall short and there is many restriction within the game,i say give it a shot just to try out the gameplay mechanics considering it rare to find a 2.5D ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes.\n\nIt add a ton of fun if you could introduced a friends to join with you in playing this game.\n\nIt pretty addictive once you get used to the combat mechanic since it fast paced and well executed.\n\nOh and the player base of this game is pretty strong especially during weekend.\n\nIf you wondering if the game is pay 2 win,it actaully not. Only pay 2 win aspect i see is the additional skill & items slots you have to purchase but that is a minor issue and it optional.\n\nJust stay away from PvP and focus entirely on it PvE. From there you gonna have a lot of fun in this game.\n\nGRADE : B ( Great )","May 24, 2014","true","257.2"," 59 of 91 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","59","91","0","3"

Once you get up to skill notes and job changes they consist of grinding the same dungeons sometimes upwards of 20 times or paying $5 USD.\n\nWhich brings me to the cash shop, sure it's a free to play game but, it may as well not be, you start off with a ridiculously small inventory which you have to pay about $2 USD to expand by 8 slot, 8 SLOTS, to top it off you need to buy these for every one of the inventory cateregories : Special, Inventory, Consumable, Item, Quest, you'd need to pay $10 USD just to upgrade each of those inventories by a measly 8 slots (not enough, so you more have to spend about $30 USD just go get enough inventory space). Then there's the costumes, they cost about $30 USD each and if you want to play competitive PvP good luck without a costume, also, if you want to play Luciel you need 2 costumes so $60. The worst part is: costumes and inventories aren't shared across characters so, that $30 USD you just spent on your main character's inventory, yep, you need to spend another $30 for every other character you want to play on,\n\nPlease don't play this game, it's Nexon's second Maplestory and is nothing but a shameless attempt to grab as much $$$ as possible.","October 1, 2015","false","206.9"," 82 of 134 people (61%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","61","82","134","15","3"

I should start off by saying that story is not its best. As for the gameplay....oh boy. If you're not having, you're straight up not having fun and surely won't while in the dungeons, some of the quest from Feita and beyond will have repeating the same dungeon over, over and over again. It could be a dungeon you absolutely despise. As for the characters, they're not there best either. You'd think such a game as this has balancing, but no KoG doesn't believe in balancing.

In PvP, you're either gonna try your hardest or die at it because once you run into someone who is S or higher will the most OP gear you've seen, your chances of winning are slim unless your absolutely sure you got this down. The content, its good but the fact that KC waters it down gets me and probably other players fustrated. Such as the latest update with the Market Revamp, I desk slammed my face so hard. No ED sinks, at all or a proper Gate of Darkness. The only thing thats not keeping me from quitting are the characters Raven, Elboy and the coming soon to NA, Add. Also, my motivation to get to lvl70 and reach for rank SSS. I'm gonna stop, this review seems long and I've explained quite enough. Yes, I still recommend this game to people who are new to this type of Gameplay, but those who seens games like this?

It literally takes the ♥♥♥♥ of the phrase and transcends the very meaning of "micro"-transaction.\n\nWhile the game can seldom be fun in its repetitive PVE grind-quests, the PVP is a complete joke. If you actually expect to stand a chance in PVP, you'll need to shell out $50+ of real money before you even start - like every opponent you'll ever face in there, assuming they aren't either hacking the game, exploiting their character's imbalance of the month, or stunlocking you in a never-ending combo until you lose while they gloat about how ♥♥♥♥ you are as they teleport around the map due to their ♥♥♥♥ internet connection.\n\nWant gloves for your character? 500 K-Ching ($5.00).\nA full outfit since you're stuck with no clothes and looking like a peasant noob? 5,000 K-Ching ($50).\n\nThe prices are obscene and KOG knows they can get away with it because mindless ♥♥♥♥wits will openly pay it because they think prices like those are okay. Which sets a lovely example for the new generation of gamers. Not only this, but at every corner/turn/etcetera, this game gives out free items that last for a matter of hours before disappearing. If you want the item, you'll have to pay these kinds of prices for it. Literally just a way to tease players and coax them into ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ away their money.\n\nAnd you know what? The greed doesn't stop there. There's a marketplace in the game and there's just as much greed there as there is from the developers. Some people actually expect you to pay hundreds of billions of in-game cash (ED) for the things you want.\n\nLiterally gaming at its worst. I'm not even going to check the box asking if I got this for free because I've spent the equivalent of two brand new AAA games and still got ♥♥♥♥all out of it. I feel cheated by this game. If there's anything this game succeeded in doing it's this: It made me realize how bad this issue is getting in games today and I promise both this company and the next that I will not touch their game should it include microtransactions.\n\nI had two friends who got totally and irrevocably consumed by this game and now spend every penny of real money they earn in it ($150 a month minimum) and won't listen to anything I have to say on the matter. I fear that when they're 25 they'll still be playing this joke of a game and spending all of their earnings on it and will both wind up homeless in the future or something. One of them won't even talk to me anymore because they don't want to hear what I have to say.\n\nI would have recommended this game for the purpose of showing people what gaming is not, but I don't want others to fall victim to this horse ♥♥♥♥ and other games that follow suit.\n\nThis last point I'm going to make isn't directly tied to the quality of the game itself but more at the community. I once had a guild in this game called MaliciousEntity and at some point I added a guy who told me some sadsack story and since I felt bad I made him an admin. After that, he took over my guild and it wasn't mine anymore. I ended up leaving and taking my closest friends there with me. Apparently, a friend of mine looked up my guild in the game and he found that a few months down the line, the guy I handed my guild over to bet my guild in a guild war or something and lost horribly, with a score of like 0-32. So my guild was handed over to the other and it was renamed to "rA". Maybe my guild will be in better hands with them, because it surely didn't mean much to the guy I initially gave it to.\n\nTL;DR:\nStory: 7/10.\nPVE: 6/10.\nPVP: Lol ♥♥♥♥ you.\nVisuals: 5/10.\nCommunity: 2/10\nMicrotransactions=True.\n\nOverall: 2.0/10.","May 6","false","9.4"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","20","27","5","1"

It'll take around a whole month of playing to get a good top piece, just buy dungeoning. The only other way your gonna get that is by spending alot of damn money for the piece. Some of the pieces are worth over 100$, just with in-game money that'd take years to get.\n\nTHE PVP IS COMPLETELY UNBALANCED. All the characters in the game are just not balanced. They have their cons and pros, but some characters, only have pros, no cons at all. Some even only have cons considering how stupidly weak they are. Onto the pay 2 win topic again, every expensive top piece gives stats, you need a whole set for more stats, you need money to get +11, probably over 100$ just to ATTEMPT.\n\nIf your glad to spend alot money on a game. Go right ahead, and you'll have one FUN time in this game. OTHERWISE, don't even bother downloading, getting the highest rank in the game probably will require you to spend around 500$. Getting to level 70 isn't as hard as it used to be.\n\nThe only good part in the pay 2 win scene in this game is, Elsword even gives chances to get some pretty good weapons, for instance, i spent nothing and got probably 15$ worth of items without even an event. Events give you the chance to get new and cool sets.\n\nOverall my rating is 9/10 to the game. But unfortunately spending is the only way your gonna enjoy it.\nTHIS IS NOT A FREE TO PLAY GAME!\n\nIGN: Fistomatic","May 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 44 of 72 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","44","72","4","0"

Once you get to around level 30, which I did, you realize that many of the skills available to unlock require you to complete unbearably repetative tasks, and nearly ALL quests ask you to do the same thing, and that is "complete this long boring easy dungeon 5 times."  To get the items required to unlock skills, you have to do the same dungeon DOZENS of times.  There aren't really many available methods of leveling up, and around where I got I realized that there really isn't much content in this game.  6 or 7 zones total with 5 or so linear "kill-all-enemies-to-move-on" dungeons (can't recall the exact amount), that you will complete an inordinate number of times in order to progress through the game.  In order to make up for the marked lack of content, they slow down the progression systems with repetative quests, stamina, and slow exp gain.\n\nAll of this, I say, would be excuseable if the combat system was phenomenal.  Well, I think it isn't, and this is where the frustration comes in.  I'm no noob when it comes to pc games.  Most of the games I've played require accuracy, speed, and precision in great amounts.  So I was naturally excited when I started learning the combat of this game, but I was soon disillusioned.  I would describe the combat as overall clunky.  There is no such thing as intuitive, fluid movement here, unless you perfect certain very difficult patterns that exploit properties of certain skills: patterns that are easy to mess up.   I would repeat a combo over and over again and have it be performed sucessfully only about 50% of the time.  I did get quite good at it, but it was never fun.  I never felt like I was truly in control.","July 14, 2014","false","36.4"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","25","39","0","1"

There's a stamina bar that limits how many monsters that can be killed in a day (it's manageable, especially with unlimited stamina weekends), but more importantly the EXP rates screw you over around level 45. I've been forced to grind several times in between dungeons around Velder for that reason, and it appears at the same spots on every character.\n\nThe progression itself doesn't feel very spectacular. You only get a skill every five levels which isn't too often when the cap is 70. Once you finally do get a variety of skills, you're locked to only using four at a time unless you pay $10 for an expansion. Changing jobs is what pathes the way to more skills, but it also gives you new combos to use in addition to your character's base ones. The problem here is that most of these combos can be impractical to use, so having more than one of a character can feel incredibly repetitive.\n\nYou mostly play the game by using combos. You also have to practice catching opponents in PvP and knocking them down wastes a good opportunity. Knocking down monsters reduces the damage they take and they may retaliate with a strong attack. Combos are pretty easy to do in PvE, especially since you can just obliterate the first 20 dungeons without a care. btw don't solo. Love yourself (and your stamina). Monsters tend to be more aggravating than they are challenging.\n\nThe art is pretty and the outfits have a unique style, but the characters have been driven to almost exclusively fan-service. This is most apparent in the recent customization options (cash only) that have appeared in the Korean server. Most (if not all) of the new female art is sexualized.\n\nThere haven't been many efforts to upgrade the "anime" quality to the game. They've stuck to the same assets they've had since the beginning which is ironic when I see ads saying "Play your manga!" as if that were the main appeal.\n\nThe characters weren't amazingly unique but they had their own things going for them. Effort has clearly dropped in development, however, and this is most apparent in their most recently released character, Add, a blatant ripoff of Accelerator from A Certain Magical Index. Although it makes sense to try to appeal to anime fans in this way, it exhibits the disrespect the game has for its own storyline. The character preceding was an imitation from their previous game--a callback and a bit of respectable fanservice--so it was no foul, but, to be fair, it also wasn't the pinnacle of creativity.\n\nThe worst part is I'm going to keep playing.","October 4, 2014","false","173.7"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","25","39","0","5"

Don't expect anything more demanding than Z+Z+Z+Z+X.\n\n- Graphics. Full 3D should be a good thing, right? Nope. Especially when you see the same low-poly 'Bob The Builder' blocks being copy-pasted from dungeon to dungeon.\n\n- Deisign. Outfits should be an incredibly tempting 'must-buy' because of how good they look. In Elsword, most outfits consist of White, Black, and an 'Accent'. Or worse: PlayBunny, Demon, Angel, Oriental.\n\n- Sounds. I had to turn this off. Battle should consist of the sound of metal colliding and wood breaking...not whoopie cushions being let loose in a vat of butter.\n\n- Music. I certainly don't remember any of it, so I went on Youtube and listened to the tracks. None of them have a 'wow' factor...and they almost feel copy-pasted.\n\n- PvE. Pretty boring and really to easy to max out. There really isn't that much challenge out there. As I typed this, I even forgot it was playing in the background...wow.\n\n- PvP. Hope you spent money if you actually want to win. With regenerating MP, talent can only get you through so much before you end up stun locked or one shotted. Especially when LuCiel gets their 2nd job...\n\n- World HUB. This really bothers me because it feels like they're just trying to stretch out the gameplay as well as give you some reason to purchase a Mount. A Mount in a sidescroller. Think about it: $. You can also spend $ traveling from HUB to HUB. Even more bothersome, the World Map is accessible anywhere...so why aren't the two of them tied together instead of being weird seperate entitites?\n\nHonestly, Grand Chase S2 was as good as this genre was going to get. Elsword is your typical Korean MMO: No originality, hand holding grind, and a constant squeeze for cash and ideas from the community. If you go into Elsword and find yourself thinking that this experiance could be better, then go hunt down a Grand Chase private server. FGC.\n\nObviously, I'm bitter because KOG failed to improve upon Grand Chase because they wanted to focus on Elsword.","July 7, 2015","false","6.2"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","27","43","2","5"

Meh, driven by their artwork, i was expecting a much more cleaner and precise model, the models look nowhere near as good or detailed as the artworks and at first it bothered the hell outta me, i will say i like almost all of the suits for nearly everyone, but i wish Job Change clothes didn't expire, smart people will see is a cheap way of the developers saying "Want to look good again? Load up money and buy some sh¡t".\nI will not sh¡t on the cloth clipping visual effects when you are wearing too much junk over since a lot of other games also have this issue, plus the fact that is not really a big deal and it doesn't have any relevant impact besides being glaring...\nGameplay-wise, i will say Elsword has a very interesting concept and it pulls it off rather well, entering dungeons and combo-ing the sh¡t out of everything that is in the path along with visually impressive attack and a good amount of skills to dish out great amounts of pain without letting your enemies breathe is very satisfying and rewarding... When you learn to get those skills.\nBlazing through dungeons is very fun and appropiated party combo is a very cool thing to do, however if you are a person who gets dissoriented easily you might find yourself losing track of yourself and your actions due to the amount of shines, effects and explosions on the screen, which admittedly can become very annoying for some people.\nPvP, on the other hand, has to be the weakest part of the game for me, and i can say for nigh-everybody, the more they attempt to fix things, the more they ♥♥♥♥ up, not to mention that, if you have spent a good amount of hours in this game, getting to know the game as much as you could, the unbalance in PvP and how broken it is becomes more evident the more you level up and face people.\nLeveling up increases base stats like HP, Phy Atk/Def and Mag Atk/Def, also after certain level thresholds, you will be able to learn more skills that do increase your might and power to badazz proportions.\nIn PvP however...\nLets run down a list from the less impacting to the most obvious and annoying.\n1. Crappy Matchmaking System: I know everyone who has spent some decent hours in PvP did experience being like Lvl 30 and you are put to brawl agaisnt a Lvl 45 ~ 70, also when, since the PvP is Rank based (Standard stuff, the more you win matches, the more you Rank up), a beginner of Rank B can be placed to fight agaisnt a Rank A or S, it doesn't impact as much as the Lvl gap matches, but is still a very r3tard3d system.\n2. LAAAAAAG: Some say the Lag issues were probably inevitable, and to that i say bullsh¡t, i've played many games in which having a below-average internet didn't impacted much on the game itself and didn't made the experience completely suck balls, when you are PvPing (1v1, 2v2 or 3v3) and someone has lag, beating that son/daughter of a b¡tch just became a whole lot harder, in 1v1 the most annoying since if someone has lag, you will be unable to engage the foe in a combo since, you land the hit, but the damage and the flinch is inflicted after a period of time, making the entire concept of the game to be completely shot in the azz.\nThis also applies to instances in PvP 2v2 ~ 3v3 where someone would activate Awakening or use a Special Active that causes Skill Freeze (Everyone in the Skill Freeze reach is immobile and unable to take action until hit or Skill Freeze ends), they are not affected or instances where the Skill Freeze is canceled by someone else who used another move that Skill Freezes, is hard to explain, but get to Lvl 70 and enter 2v2 SS Ranks matches and see for yourself.\n3: Character Disbalance: This, same as the issue with PvP Lag, becomes more apparent the more you progress and face players at higher levels, certain classes are CLEARLY better than others, being for mobility, damage, coverage or all of the above, this is even more obvious when you look at classes like LK, RS and IS and then you look at classes like LP and MM, and even if the previously issues are not present, some classes are just a cakewalk to use:\nEM: All she needs to do is XZZ or just keep running away and use Meditation or just stay still and camp MP, Some EMs may say "Duuude, we need a lot of MP to attack", and i say, once again, BULL. SH¡T. The moment you get MP, you use the MP, but you get a lot of MP, since EM has the biggest MP gain by attacks and almost all her attacks provide a great MP gain.\nRena Classes: ♥♥♥♥ them all, To start, all of them noob Renas just spam ^X or ^^X to catch since is fast and has good coverage, don't be surprised if you are caught repeatedly by those noob Renas that just wait for you to approach them and ^X is the only thing they know to do, then there is what i consider to be the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing bummer after Add, RENA'S AND AISHA'S TUMBLING.\nThis abomination of a feature makes it a death-wish to throw Renas or Aisha into the air and hit them while airborne, if you do, they do a flip and as soon as they land, they can jump again, unlike all other characters that after landing, have a slight delay before being able to move, making it very easy for them to cassually hop out of your combos and back-firing you.\nADDISON: This MOFO is the epidemy of Aimbot, almost all of his moves cover a good area, any commands he has are so easily spammable that a one-handed fetus with mental problems would be able to combo and nigh all of his moves are homing.\nHe was made with the sh¡ttiest HP output, but you know that doesn't mean a damn when you can't even get close to touching him since he always has the screen bombarded with homing moves.\n4 and most important. Gear Difference: You can be the best of your kind, the number one as your class, however you face a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that has a cutting-edge gear and wrecks you over in just a few single hits, Gear Carry is without a doubt the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing problem of balance that helps unbalancing the already unbalanced PvP.\nCostume Parts, Costume Suits, Magic Amulets, Magic Stones, all of those, 90% requiring you to waste real-life money to get easily, these parts do build up a good chunk of your battle stats, and just with that gear boost, a completely ♥♥♥♥ing noob and idiotic player can pot shot a pro player effortlessly by just having the gear advantage, this becomes much more frecuent when you are on your road to SS and SSS, you will find players with absurd stats that with landing 15 hits on you is enough to take you down while you will have to strike them like a sewing machine to get remotely close to depleting a small slice of their HP.\nIn the now PvP Season 3, the gear advantage is even more apparent as it can make playing serious PvP SERIOUSLY UNBEARABLE, More so when you are constantly being placed to fight agaisnt the same exact gear carried douch3bags who have obnoxiously strong gear sets, Even more so when they behave all mighty just because they have the gear upper-hand.\nMusic: No need since music is subjective.\n\nEND VEREDICT: As i said in the beggining of this review, this is JunkFood game, play it until you get to Level cap and had enough fun with PvP, then uninstall and change to another game.","February 4, 2015","false","668.3"," 48 of 83 people (58%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","58","48","83","9","0"

(Actually required a brain) Now? So many people are playing the characters that don't. This game (PvP wise) is more class focused. The classes that are pretty much easy and dumb to play are Add (DE and LP) , Ara, Elesis (GM mostly), Chung (IP), Lu/Ciel, and Eve. Although, Eve damage is more balanced in sparring. She's legitimately dumb in arena. So if you want to win A LOT, play a character that doesn't require a brain or minimum work. If you were to put the best LK vs the best DE player, LK would lose. Too many people play easy classes. What's the fun in that? It's horrible for those that plays a character that require more thinking and game plan. If this game were to make the old character more powerful to withstand those easy classes, it would be a lot more fun. The gear in this game are fine. Yes, even with +12, and +11. It's purely based on your class and how good you are with them. But if you're playing a class that requires more thinking, no matter how geared and skilled you are, you will lose to the easy class that is geared and skilled too. Not to mention that this game requires Player to Player connection. This means that if you live in Australia, fighting a player that's in the U.S, you both will experience delay. Some classes are more lag proof than other classes, so you may be at a disadvantage. Surprising Fact: Not a lot of people know about this. You would have to PvP on a class that's hard to play to understand this. (Class vs Class case) P.S I'm a CBT player and a KR player. I recently just switched from the actual client to Steam client, just to write a review for this game. Which is why I have 5.3 hours played.","May 9","false","106.0"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","18","27","2","0"

I won't deny that, but what I absolutely hate about this game is the community.\nI'm an Elsword "veteran." I've been playing since before Eve's character release.\nI can tell you that Elsword had an amazing community with lovable players. It was very easy to make friends and get into guilds. It was like we were a big family. Even if there were tons of us.\nI'm not here to tell you how I miss the old Elsword. I'm warning you about this game. The community is absolutely horrible. I can't Arena without people whispering me "You have no skill." or "Salty?"\nIt's absolutely depressing. I can't play this game without getting mad and taking it out on players, which only gets worse. Call me salty, that word's overused anyways.\nI hate Elsword. There was a time when I would recommend this game to you because it was amazing, but that time is long-gone and likely to never return.\nI don't want to sound like the "Haha, I've been playing since ____, and this game suCKS! I WANT THE OLD ELSWORD BACK!" because I, personally, don't like people like that and to be honest, they taint the "Elsword Veteran" name.\nWe get it, the game was good back then but stop trying to get it back.\nThat's why I'm quitting this game for good. I've never played such a rage-inducing game. Even Dungeons suck. I can't go through one without the entire team yelling "hurry up" just because I'm not at the portal within 1 second of the timer coming up.\n\nTo be honest, it could just be who I am.

Reasons being:\n\n-Need to pay for a bslot which will allow to use 4 more skills in your hotbar\n\n-Need to pay for a costume set or pieces which you can socket to gain optimal stats for both PVP and PVE\n\n-Not as neccessary, but a thing called a "Magic Necklace" that will allow you to gain more MP from normals (30%)\n\n-Also not as neccessary except for some classes, an extra skill page that will allow you to make two builds optimized for PVP and PVE\n\nWith these three basic things, after capping or becoming a high level at least you can assume you will be on par with most players in the higher ranks. Also, it was not like ths in the past but now it is very easy to obtain amulets to enchance your equipments with. People may argue otherwise but no matter how "broken" a class is Elsword requires a certain level of prowess to play so as long as you spend this certain amount of money and you don't completely suck you can reach your full potential. It can be fun if you make it out to be. Just be prepared to work and grind for the things you don't gain using plain money.\n\nOn the other hand, if you wish to be a casual F2P player than you will be forced to play without the three things listed above (of course, you can acquire them from other players with ingame money, but said ingame money is rather hard to acquire without spending money real or ingame or without a powerful character that would need the items in the first place) and will be playing on a considerably lower plane than the paying players. The upside to this is that if you keep on the lookout for events that may give out free costumes, bslots, and magic necklaces than everything will be dandy.\n\n__The Game Itself__\n\nAs an MMORPG Elsword is a cut above the rest in that it has colorful and interesting characters with fun skills and you can make your own combos and do dressup, with everything having a sort of.. high quality to it. Everything is so cool.  It also has an active community with helpful forums that will address most issues you might have while providing many beginner guides to almost all of the game's mechanics. Elsword is constantly updating with new content on a consistent basis including new costumes, classes, revamps, dungeons, towns, and bosses so you don't feel like things are stagnant.\n\nOn the other hand this game has its fair share of funny and annoying bugs, unhelpful and rude members, frustrating disadvantages caused by lack of balance, overpowered gear, and seemingly ridiculous character mechanics, but hey, nobody's perfect.\n\n__Conclusion__\n\nTL;DR Play if you are planning to spend money and git gud skillwise or casual with friends but don't if you're neither of these. You'll end up bored and feeling like you wasted time.\n\nTo veteran players who may be reading this, let's keep clenching our asses and continue to enjoy this wonderful and terrible game.","July 11, 2015","true","137.9"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","18","30","2","2"

Every character has its own playstyle, and each class can vary that playstyle vastly.  However, it goes without saying that some characters will always be better than others, no matter how skillful you are.  However, this game is fun even if you do not main one of the better classes.  PvP is still winnable and PvE is nowhere near impossible.\n\nFun or Boring:   This game is an MMO, so expect grinding.  However, expect much less grinding than any other MMO.  Leveling is easy, especially considering the exp boosts that KoG is always giving along with free level boosts.  HOWEVER, do not level boost your first character.  Leveling up your first character for the first time can be one of the most fun things about this game.  I am a PvE player and have yet to get bored after my countless hours.  I have logged in 832.5 hours on steam as I write this review, but have been playing since May of 2013.  Counting the hours I have before this game was on steam, I have quite a bit.  The game is still being updated constantly.  Events are nonstop, and new areas and level cap increases have been chaning a lot recently.  The best part is, you can check the KR server for things to come in NA.\n\nCommunity:   This is really a tough one.  Given it is an anime game, except creeps as well as normal gamers.  There are plenty of young kids who assume that playing a girl character means you are a girl irl... and will hit on you.  Toy with them :)  .  Besides them, there are random roleplayers and such, but finding the right guild isn't hard.  Many of the more active players will be in guilds that may not accept low levels, so finding good friends can be hard at first.\n\nWay the Game Plays:   Image super mario smash brothers, except with spells, mana, and an amazing PvE system.  Also, this game is much more respsonsive to controls given it is a PC game.  Lag can be an annoying issue, as a party cannot kick a lagger.  The only kicking system atm is one that allows all party members to vote to kick a player who hasnt dealt enough damage.  Even buffers do enough damage, so if the button is lit, I suggest clicking it.\n\nF2P:   This is a F2P game which means MANY MANY microtransactions.  If you want to complain that this game has too many or that its game breaking, please cry elsewhere.  Costumes are the only essential thing in this game that you can buy from the item mall.  However, you can get yourself 4 costume pieces for 250mil ED if you dont mind your costume not matching.  250mil sounds like a ton at first, but given you earn over 1mil ED per level 70 run, and there are now lvl 80 dungeons, you can earn that ED fairly easily.  Whats that? 250 runs just for costume pieces sounds like a grind?  Fear not.  As you level up, just make sure to hold onto your ED and you will have plenty.  I am not even including items such as secret dungeon materials.  You can obtain somewhere between 3-25 of these per run depending if you do lutos mode or not.  Currently these prices went up to roughly 300k-400k per piece, so you can sell those easily.  Not to mention, almost every event has free accessories or costumes that you can earn by simply playing enough (usually involves logging in for 10 minutes each day).  PvP is limited by your gear, but PvE is not at all.  I know someone who is ranked top 50 with a +9 weapon, which is now extremely easy to get if you understand the concepts of making money in this game.","January 11","true","434.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","8"

The combat is a hack and slash button mashing of z & x. Although, over a long period of time, the combat starts getting boring, knowing the only time you get more combat moves is when you get your class change, I am going to rate the combat a 6/10.\n\nEach character has  their own story, weapons, and combat style, but some of the different characters have the same class change stats, which imo, is kinda lame, but like i said, they all have their own combat style.\n\nThe maps in the game start to get redundant and lack imagination, because some of their maps are the same, but flipped, or with a different climate and time.\n\nI think the thing I hate most about this game is the stamina, you have stamina on every character, and when its empty, you can't do any dungeon quests and you have to wait until 3:00am to play again, which makes you think that the creators don't want you to play the game.\n\nMy rating for this game is a 6/10. I do reccomend to people who are new to PC gaming. Its still fun at time and i would continue playing it because they are always adding new items and characters that get enjoyable.\n\n","July 18, 2014","false","97.4"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","0"

It's not mind blowing, but for a vividly colored anime world, it's really nice. And the gameplay is innovative too. Sure, you can just mash te keyboard and swing wildly, but if you want to really survive, especailly if you're going solo rather than in a party of online players, then you WILL master all the key combinations in order to dish out powerful combo moves.\nHowever, as you get higher and level, the pressure to spend real money gets higher and higher, or maybe it's because I didn't have people to play with.\nHowever, the game is still fun, killing monsters is satisfying, and the boss battles are so incredibly awesome and epic, you'd think Nintendo thought them up! So if you have lots of friends, and don't mind spending real money (mayeb 30 dollars), then this is the game for you.","July 5, 2015","true","12.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

Why you would need to boost exp to level up only once and which still takes a long time to do is beyond me.\nYou won't fully enjoy the game unless you're within the level range of 50-70, which again, why would I need to be that high of a level to enjoy a game to its fullest. I'm not just talking about certain things being blocked off to you if you do not reach level requirement by the way.\nEven so though, I'm not sure your attention span will even want to go that high of a level if you're not into grind fest, which this game is a HUGE grind fest. Example, early in the game, it will only take you around 2-4 hours to get from level 1 to level 15 easily, at first you're like, "This isn't too hard if the game is like this all the time." which you would be right......if the game worked like that in the first place...but when comes the time of around let's say....level 36, it will take you a day to jump to level 37.\nNow, let's talk about classes, the system is a complete mess, I won't lie to you. After you fight a couple of matches with people in your skill range ( as in how well they fight etc etc) you wll notice that some characters are WAY better in pvp than others. What do I mean by that, well....if you took an average skilled elsword and throw them against an average skilled add, more than likely without fail, the add is going to win. Why? well because all skills activate instantaneously, elsword is melee based even if he took the magic path, his range does not exceed that of an add's, the add player will only have to keep his distance and hit the elsword at least once to get even closer to him and then throw in some long comboes which will probably do a significant amount of damage, rinse and repeat. The same can be said about the mage, all she would have to do to beat a swsordsman, is run away with her teleport skill which has a low cooldown of about like 5-10 seconds, cast a spell (which is also instantaneous) run away, stand still to recover MP at which they recover MP way faster than any swordsman will recover, rinse and repeat.\nThis doesn't only apply to PvP, those same characters that are generally better in pvp, are sometimes generally better in dungeons. WHY?! This baffles me on why this game only focuses on making the strong characters stronger, and the weaker ones even weaker, I just don't get it.\nInstead of making the main character, Elsword, which this game is named after him, stand a chance against these over-powered characters, they make an entirely different character, his older sister, the swordsman that can stand a chance against them. Any new character this game will add, you'd win any bet that that the new character will be even more over-powered than the last character. This game's balance of equal powers, doesn't exist, it's been throw out and left somewhere in the middle of nowhere.\nWhat's even worse for any elsword player is not what lies with the character himself, it's the community. Elsword has a skill which can make him unflinchable for only a few seconds so he can get past all these spells or long range attacks that are being thrown at him so he can stand a chance against them. Sounds cool right? Well, too bad, according to the community that skill makes you a noob and you will not be liked by anyone if you use it, and therefore discouraged to use it to give any elsword player an advantage over the newer characters and classes.\nI only list the character, elsword's, problems because he has it the worst, the second swordsman, Raven, may also have problems with these new classes and characters but not as bad as any elsword player.\n--------------------------This isn't the end of this game's problems, there is more..........-------------------------------------\nThe community of people here isn't very pleasant.......\nYou either have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who usually are the competitive type who aren't nice to you if you use a tactic that they don't like, or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because of no reason, people who are generally good people, or people who goes both ways. Some people you find you may say they are ok people, being ok people does not mean they are generally good people, just for the record. I will not hate on the beggars which I will talk about why later.\nLag isn't something to write about because any MMO that has the same feel of fast pace fighting will face this problem. The lag will depend on how powerful your computer is and also your internet connection, so at that point it's not the game's fault so don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t me.\nAnother major point to bring out is that this game is WAY, WAY too benefitting on the Pay-To-Win area. You don't gain a small advantage if you buy a costume and enhance it, you will gain a HUGE advantage. Well what do I mean by that? Well....if you fight a person, and you both do not have a costume before, you both are in the same skill area, same characters and exact same class, and you fight and it's a close match and you win. Well, the same person comes back the next day, has a costume and has enhanced it with speed or power and challenges you again, more than likely, you're going to lose more almost all of the matches against that person, and more than likely it will not even be a close match, because of your lack of a costume.\nThe only only way to obtain a costume is if you pay real money to get one, or by people selling costumes, which is ANOTHER major issue to this game.....\nYou see, the reason why I don't mind beggars is because I know there is a good reason for it....the economy is a complete and utter trainwreck, there is just no going around it. Hyper inflation has hit this game real hard and continues to do so. Want one of the current costumes that is only obtain through ice burners and generally looks cool? well you're going to have to pay 600 million ED (in game currency) for a single piece of that costume......WHY?!?! ED isn't easy to get either for people who don't use real money for this game, you eitehr have to do weeks worth of grinding for around a 200 mil, and then hear that the item you wanted has inflated to an even higher price, so you're screwed. Simple cosmetic items are far more EXPENSIVE than the actual gear that matters.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe only reason why I would reccomend you to play this game as it is right now, is if:\nA) You have friends you can play with and you know you're not going to hate eventually\nB) You only live for the grinding in games\nC) Have money to waste onto this game\nD) Dont mind the fact some other characters are generally better than the one you are going to pick\nE) Will never touch the ranking PvP mode\nF) Have patience with a game\nG) Don't get angry at games\nThese are the only reasons why I would recommend this to you.\nOh, and it's not, " Only one of these apply to me, I think I'm going to like this." no you need to have the qualities of at least 3 of those options to enjoy this.","August 29, 2014","false","0.1"," 40 of 73 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","40","73","4","0"

Back during the 2014-2015 Elsword days, you'd had to sacrifice some of that cash in order to buy the extended skill slot and a ring of fury. Now, those items are buyable from the board. The economy thankfully deflated sometime ago and Ice Burner sets are easier to obtain compared to how they were back then.\n\nNow here's the problem with Elsword.\n\nPvP is STILL unbalanced. Winning/Losing a match is usually decided in this order: Gear > Class > Actual Skill. I find this odd since Ereda Island actually normalizes damage, so why is PvP not like this?\n\nI still like Elsword, but I'm going to give this game a negative review since there's no mixed reccomendation on Steam. The community is also something to take in account, which I have mixed feelings about. The community had changed so much from when I started back in 2013 that I can't help but feel saddened over it.

Overall community is great i often talk with random people in town and dungeons but at the same time pvp is the exact opposite which is why in pvp i ignore chat and focus on winning. Fairly easy to gain levels and progress up to level 50 after that it depends if your willingness to sell your soul to the game. Another problem is as for gear that game is very limited unless your a very capable fighter", or u have loads of money to buy item mall gear, or you're online all the time the for the occasional event. in my opinion the game is 7.5/10","July 4, 2015","true","959.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/237310/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Elsword is a Korean MMO beat 'em up in 2&1/2D. Here the player controls one out of nine (as of now) characters to level them up and defeat hordes of monsters while progressing through the story.\n\nUnfortunately, I already ran into problems at the level of trying to register an account. Apparently their confirmation emails can only reach certain domains, like GMail. Before I figured it out, however, I already linked my Steam account to the one that I couldn't activate and had to wait a few days for it to expire before being able to re-link it to a working one. During that time my enthusiasm for this game died out completely and it basically set the tone for my playthrough of this. If the creators fail on the level of account creation... That's just not a good sign.\n\nOnce we enter the game, the first thing that comes to us is the fact that the English localization team decided to leave the Korean voice acting intact, which is quite unusual for most English versions of Asian games. I personally don't mind them, it's just that it was kinda hard to understand what they were actually saying, me being used more to Japanese.\n\nSpeaking of that, I usually like to mod my games to some extent, so I managed to find (by complete accident) a mod which replaces the voice packs with those from different languages, so for example I could try getting Japanese ones into the game, which would keep it somewhat climactic yet I would be able to make out some words out of it... eeexcept the NA version (which is apparently the Steam one) changed the voiceover format from .wav to .ogg. For no reason.\n\nAnother thing that stroke me as kind of odd is the fact that you need to name your characters. I mean, it would be okay if they were just classes to be chosen from and you could customize their appearance to some extent, but they are all named characters with unique backstories. Why do you have to call yourself something like "Eve Clone no. 99"? Why can't you just give your account as a whole a single nickname to use for all of your characters?\n\nI stretched out this rant long enough, so let's get to the main part of the review.\nThe anime-style cell-shaded graphics look okay. They aren't anything spectacular, and can kind of make your eyes tired, especially the low-res textures. While it did take over three years for the game to leave Asia, it still came out later than for example Team Fortress 2.\n\nIn the sound department, it's honestly mediocre. None of the music felt memorable to me, and you will get tired of your characters saying the same thing over and over again during their combos or victory poses.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, it's pretty much just your standard 2&1/2D beat 'em up but with RPG elements. You level up your character, your skills, obtain better gear, power it up... At level 15 you can advance into one of the three possible paths for your character, each possessing different skills and abilities, and at level 35 you can achieve the final form of your chosen path. And here's where the bad things begin to pop up: even the normal mooks are often tanky damage sponges with heavily-telegraphed attacks, turning at least the early game into a button mashing contest of you just wearing down their HP using the same combos over again. Your chances of dying at anything that isn't at least a mini-boss are basically nonexistant provided you do dodge their blows. You can use special skills which are usually very powerful hits or autocombos akin to supers from fighting games, burning MP in the process which can be gained back by hitting enemies and slowly replenishes itself over time. Also, you get only three item quickslots and four skill quickslots. You can double those amounts... by paying real money. Imagine if in an MMORPG, you had a very limited quickbar for skills and items and had to pay for another quickbar.\n\nOh, and guess what: after reaching certain levels, you get two new skills... to choose from. Yes, you can get only one of those two. Considering you are already limited to taking a maximum of eight skills with you to any given battle, four if you didn't pay up, this kind of thing heavily limits the level of versatility your character can achieve. Of course, you can get the other skills via a different skill tree... by paying real money for it. The worst part is, it wasn't like this for six years. Only later did the creators realize that they can grab money off of that new possible restriction.\n\nAlso, the costume pieces you get in this game only last so long. After that, you are switched back to regular, unimpressive, plain clothes. I dislike limited-time stuff like this in games in general, since they're just one huge bait. You get used to them, and then they are taken away, like that. If you want me to earn my cool looks later on, then don't showcase them early on, so I will actually be able to see how my character progresses from plain clothing to divine-level armor or something.\n\nThe quests are also disappointing. They have the standard story dialogues, with the only difference being that your character isn't a soulless mime who just listens to what others have to say. Most of the quests are your basic "kill X enemies", "collect X items" or "beat X dungeon". Heck, some quests even outright tell you to beat the same dungeon multiple times. Let the obvious grind begin!\n\nWhat also bothers me is the fact that higher difficulties, for the most part, count as Numerical Hard, i.e. enemies' stats are inflated to higher levels but they fight the same way and it only takes longer to beat them down. Besides that, higher difficulties sometimes add an additional miniboss for you to fight, and that's about it.\n\nAnother thing is that, despite it being technically a beat 'em up, it still has accuracy and evasion stats. Why does the RNG get to decide whether or not you hit the monster when your weapon visibly makes physical contact with it?\n\nSince this is a beat 'em up, I wanted to play it on a gamepad, but this game's support for it is honestly pretty mediocre. You still need your mouse to get through menus, and the number of skill and item quickslots (without buying the additional ones!) already exceeds the number of buttons a PS controller (which I'm using) posseses. So you'll have to reach your hand out to the keyboard often.\n\nI can't say much about PvP since I'm not interested in it, but I can already tell that it's not fun. The game allows you to take your gear and its stat boosts into PvP matches, and while it does get "normalized" to not allow min-maxers to build something ridiculously broken and impossible to counter, it doesn't apply to everything. While skill obviously allows you to overcome challenges, the gear is still an important part of it. You'd think that it being a beat 'em up will have some kind of way of purely skill-based play, at least as an option, but no.\n\nOkay, so until now it was only the negatives. What are the positives? Well... the wide variety of characters and their possible classes allow for a lot of experimentation. The bosses are still pretty fun to fight against. There is also a Stamina system which is supposed to lock your character out of dungeons for the duration of the day if their Stamina gets completely depleted, but it shouldn't happen unless you've been playing for a few hours straight. The character arts also look absolutely amazing. (Too bad they aren't nearly as detailed in the game itself.)\n\nMy final verdict? The cons far outweigh the pros. There are restrictions on things that shouldn't even be restricted and certain solutions to things that are just plain stupid. I can't recommend it unless you play it more as a side thing for fun, not taking it too seriously and ignoring all of the limitations induced upon you.","April 21, 2015","false","8.3"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","6"

I been playing consoles and other games for a while now and been playing non-steam version of elsword for 3 years.I just gotten me a gaming computer and gotten steam for it. Anway let me begin the review.\n\nPros:\n\n*Have at least 3 friends to play this game with and you have a blast.\n\n*The back ground and the scenarios of the game  are soo beautiful.(it is anime base after all.)\n\n*It's classic, bring back Memories to classic gamers and there isn't that many 2D side scrollers mmo's, so if your a indie gamer kind of person and into mmo's, this game is for you.\n\n*The outfits in this game are just amazing, I love them all. You can never get tierd of changing looks and there always new ones to enjoy and like.\n\nCons:\n\n*Mindless action- Meaning there no strategies,tacties or thinking needed to beat enemys and foes in elsword, it's all about rushing in and attacking as fast as you can with out letting the enemy or foe move an-inch in this game(like pvp), results of being to easy and finishing the duns and enemy off and not much of a challenge. Elsword doesn't have class roll's meaning any healers,tanks or supporters, everone bascially a offense char and all there class are to, but some class have very little support skill like TT  with shield and MP giving and WS the only class that have a healing skill but no one use it but hey elsword is a to easy game and you don't need it but add-ons like this is what make team work and mmo's interesting.. but oh well.\n\n*Not all costumes can be obtain easily, like ice burners, you can only get them through burning Ice burners, the problem is..it give you most useless stuff most of the time like magic stones,Advance magic stones, shards more. Those are the 3 it give more then the useful stuff like ib sets,high level accessory and +6 ammy's or more.So that means you could be spending 100$ and not get anything useful.\n\n*The Economy in this game is sooo bad, Everything is expensive, the cash shop and in-game board. A Perm outfit is 33$ and skill slot B is 9$ and a mount is 23$(for a short time after the event) so you could be spending 60$ per char or more sometime just for the small things you want. As for the in-game board..it's impossiable to get anything(For NA Elsword). A lot of people said "Well, stop complaing about the game being expensive, you can just buy it off board" but elsword in-game board for costume pieces and ib sets and rare items be over 100 mil ED and you only get 2 mil Ed per run in final region of elsword duns(Sander). So trading and and having good spending friends is your best luck in elsword NA.\n\n*The game is nothing but a RGN loot(meaning it rely to much on drop rates,random and mostly luck)there no quest in this game that just give you anything rare or worthy really...\n\n*The game is super reapetitive...(example) beat the dun on normal, oh you beat it? Good, do it again hard, now very hard, now very hard 3 times. Once you done with the quest, your only half way there to level up, so you would have to do the duns over 10-25 times(through Feita-Sander regions) it get pretty annoying and boring pretty quickly and  tiersome and it prove this game was to careless and lazy in-making for the questing system.\n\n*pvp...is the most complan thing ever in this game, it's pretty much broken and very much un-blance and very much gear-base.But I won't go into detail much sense the community it self will tell you how bad elsword pvp is.\n\n*Stamina system..idk what to say except it stupid and pretty tearing the players freedom of playing. Once it hit zero, all you can do is play pvp, stand around and talk with people and play on another char.\n\n*Sound track- The sound track in this game is so bad and boring, meh, I only like 3 and pretty much it, most people had to add custom for mods but to others, most don't.\n\n*Content- Okay they clam they have new content constantly more then other mmo's which is true, ever 2 weeks they have a new update, but reason I dislike it, cause it mostly just new ib sets, new outfits,mounts and pet to spend a lot of money on and barely anything new.\n\n*Customization-They said in the about me."Customize like crazy"but there isn't any "real" costomization at all unless"you paid for it" and"grind for it" which ever mmo have or should have so I say it's pretty misleading what they said in there advertising and about the game section.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Only if you don't mind it being nothing but a grind-fest(meaning to much farming and nothing but repetitive questing),can afford this game, you don't mind  a mmo's of picking chars you like and not create your own character , you like small and simple game that doesn't offer much contex and got good friends that willing to take time into this game, but over all I don't recommend this game. Personally I quit this game, not even void or korean server interest me much , cause of the game play it self. But sadly I still play this game only for friends reason. But once PSO2 and BNS comes to NA(there still hope for BNS for NA btw) i'm 100% done with elsword.\n\nBonus:\nIs this game paid to win?It's more a mixture, half paid to win and half not.\n\nPve:No\n\nPvp:Seem like it\n\nThose costume and putting duel stones on them(expecially on ib sets) makes you un-stop-able plus the fact with the skill notes to boost your attack skills and able to get repair scrolls and have the extra skill slot for high advantage in pvp and most of all having those 6+ or more ammy's for high advantage for your SD and herir gear that cause pvp to be gear base expcially around S-SSS Rank.(seriously, what mmo charge extra for skill slot?).\n\nEverone have there own opiouns what they think of this game, please don't assume i'm complaing about the tiniest things in this game and wish everything to be easily handed to me for all the cons I listed have been a huge issues for years in this game.\n\nPS: If I had to reccomend better F2P anime mmo or mmorpg game's that out in Western I would say "Dragon nest, Aura Kingdom and Mabinogi" those 3 games tend to have more content and context and true "RP"  and  fair rate price in Both Western then Elsword does ;3.But I do have other to recommend but  there not out yet but coming soon.\n\nThat is all and have a nice day.","November 14, 2014","false","0.2"," 30 of 56 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","30","56","0","0"

I even played the Chinese knock off Fists of Fu. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said I had well over 20,000 hours. From 2010 to early 2014 this game was my life. And I haven't played it seriously since 2014! Yet somehow this game is still on my mind, it's just a scar on my life I can't seem to forget.\nAvoid this game like the plague, if your weak willed it will suck you in and leave you covered in salt and with an empty wallet.\n\nPros-\n\nGood PvP on paper.\n\n\n\nCons-\n\nOne of the most vile communities I've ever seen. Really, it's horrendous.\n\n"Events" are either PvP with GMs that have fixed stats, or drop $100 on costumes.\n\nWeeaboo infestation.\n\nLaggy PvP\n\nRecently Reduced FPS cap.\n\nAs pay to win as you can possibly get. People who pay for costumes have over double the stats of a non paying player.\nThey also have double the amount of skills that can be used in PvP.\n\nCompletely Unbalenced.\n\nKOG is progressivly modifiying the game to make combat worse.\n\nOld classes are completely outdated, (Wind Sneaker being the exception, her concept alone has been broken since she was released years ago) they recently released a character that literally replaces Elsword himself.\n\nLeveling up consists of doing the same dungeon 3 times or more.\n\nA casual player will probably take an entire year or more to reach the level cap. Because the PvE is so boring that you'll do anything to get out of it. Like arguing with weeaboos in the vile section of the game called "sparring"\n\nThe only reason this game is still alive is because a small group of unlucky souls collect these Ice Burner Sets. Basically,  you spend $1 on an Ice Burner, this Ice Burner has like a 0.000000000000001 chance to give you a rare costume that changes on monthly basis. They buy in bulk, usually $300 at a time. And less fortunate people look at them like gods. Hoping that their $5 charge will get them something (It wont).\nIf you have a ♥♥♥♥ PC, steam has so many better options than this terrible game.\n\n","February 9","false","93.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That being said i've been playing elsword since 2011 and many things have yet to change, It is so pay to win that when you get to a certian point to where all of the dungeons are clear and all you want to do is PVP or redo the dungeons, you cant do so without having to buy a set with real money. The character customazation they so proudly show you every single loading screen is only possible with the use of money. And the PVP is as easy as who spent the most money on gear (from lvl 65+)  For years now elsword has been doing this nonsense, and maybe you might get a costume drop every other week after you grind the same dungeon 50 times or mabye get a OP mount for a day after you log on for a week, but regardless Elsword is still an unbalenced, pay to win game masked with colorful characters and a couple hours fun of fun pvp.","March 6","false","207.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters/classes are cool and can be fun, but after you get your final "job" class at 35 you stagnate and you stick to the same old combos for the rest of the game.\n\nIt's free though so I suppose you don't have much to lose.","March 18","false","35.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The pvp in this game is quite unpolished, tons of mechanics but the match making is screwed up, u pretty much get matched up to complete randoms, hence they can be lv 80(the max lv) and ur a lv10\n\n3.Extremely grindy, takes 20 years to grind a few ED (in game currency) which can be used to purchase stuff\n\n4. Super bad currency! RIP OFF, KOG games wanted money so bad that one piece of custume costs 5 dollars.\n\n5. Pay to win\n\n6. Trying to buy stuff with in game cash (ED) is not possible, one custume costs 100 million ED and u earn 5 k each dungeon which takes 15 mins.....\n\n7.

To be able to compete in combat against other players when your character reaches a high level, you must at least invest around 30$ generally, this will cover the B slot so you can use your character to its fullest potential (9$), a costume to wear and enchant for stats that are needed to compete without being at a disadvantage (20$ total for a PERMANENT -not 30 day duration- hair, top piece -shirt-, bottom piece -pants-, gloves, and shoes). Do not say that you can use the so-called "Free-KChing (Premium currency used to purchase B-slot and costumes amongst many other things that are sort of required to get the most out of this game)" surveys to get all of your KChing, because each survey has a 5% chance of working and can't actually be relied on to pay off the cost of fully enjoying this game.\n\nAlso, even if you do pay the 30$ (or 40$ for things that help a good amount like necklaces, or trinkets, and skill notes that make otherwise sub-par skills very good), you will never be able to get rid of the lag in pvp that ruins the fun of quite a bit of your matches (especially if you are Eve, the Nasod Queen character, because she is what is called lag-sensitive meaning that lag is more likely to brush off the hit your character does, like for example you stab someone in game and lag interferes, they might take damage, but they won't react to your stab and your opponent can hit you and knock you back; leaving you open for an attack, even though you hit first. -Which happens quite often-) Your 30-40$ also will never cure the horrible community that will rage at your for playing certain characters they find are OP even though they probably aren't. Nor will it cure the amount of boring grind you will have to do (expect to pay 4-10$ on instantly completing quests for say a job advancement which is more than nessecary, or unlocking a good skill if you don't want to waste 30 hours doing that). Also if you mess up allocating skills, and you've used up the two temporary skill resets the game gives you upon class advancements it will cost _20_ dollars to get a new one.\n\nThen comes the games economy where EVERYTHING, is expensive. You may buy premium costumes for ED (in-game currency gained by completing dungeons), but this is unrealistic. You will be paying around 1 billion ED for a 20$ costume with this current economy's rate (50,000,000 -50m or 50 million- ED for every 100 KChing, equating to 1,000,000,000 -1bil or 1 billion which takes nearly forever to make without paying- ED for 2,000 KChing), and you may not buy Skill Slot B in-game with ED, or you risk account bans and unprotected trading, resulting in scamming (when a player doesn't pay you or give you the item you paid for). Because although KC (Killer Combo, this games publisher in NA) may punish players for scamming you if you video record your transactions (even though you won't get your deserved goods or ED), Skill Slot B is not giftable which is the method for trading item mall (where you spend your KChing and buy Skill Slot B and/or costumes) merchandise that is not costumes, for costumes can be traded (but other items can not be, meaning you can be scammed, because you can pay your ED hoping they will gift your item to you, but they might just leave, meaning you won't get your item, regardless of if you report with video evidence of scamming or not.\n\ntl;dr But if you want to play this game, just play it on the KR sever, EVERYTHING IS BETTER AND YOU WILL NOT SUFFER EVEN THOUGH YOU WILL HAVE TO KNOW KOREAN OR GET AN ENGLISH PATCH. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THE NORTH AMERICAN SERVER OR YOU WILL WASTE UNNECSSARY TIME AND MONEY IN COPIOUS AMOUNTS.","April 23, 2014","false","95.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Then the next topic is the PVP items, that you have to spend real cash for so you have a chance to stand against someone who wastes money to just fight in the Arena when the system of hit detection and internet that are so bad when you are fighting someone on McDonalds internet as I say it is like Minecraft PVP internet problems. But for anything I would say this game is far worse than any other Pay2Win games besides Grand Chase. But It is a pretty fun besides doing the same levels over and over again and the broken PVP netcode but I wouldn't recommend playing it even though i still am since I have nothing else to do.

Why is that?  To be honest, I don't even know.  Most of the community is toxic as ♥♥♥♥, people not from NA like to raid our server making it even laggier than it should be, those who pay definetly have an edge over f2p players, and in PvP (imo the selling point of this game) your rank is no longer a direct correlation of your skill level. If you can ignore these, Elsword is still a great game.  You can have stylish af combos, the effects in the game are pretty well done, and thanks to the variety of classes in the game, (9 characters with 3 classes each, soon one more will be added with two classes), gameplay is varied.  Tbh, if KoG can stop making this game super ♥♥♥♥, and the freemium in this game was toned down a bit,  This could by far be one of the best games in our generation.  But until KoG pulls their ♥♥♥♥ together, I can't in my right mind reccomend this to random people.  If I know you though, play with me I need people to play with ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","May 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

Other than the fact that the people behind this game are as greedy as a fat kid in a Golden Coral, it is an ok game and the only reason why I am saying that is because its a *clears throat and puts up finger for air quotes* "f2p". Would I reccomend? Matters do you want to get pressured into buying ♥♥♥♥ for this game. Believe it or not, the cheapest costume if you want it permanantly cost $30+(If you want the wings and tail). PvP is straight garbage. The PvP doesnt even attempt to match people of the same level (I can not tell you how many times I tried to PvP as a Lvl 20 and get put up against a Lvl 45+). The PvP is pretty much who ever starts there combo first wins. Dungeons, all you pretty much have to do is run through them with a mount and you will get an ss on everything (Also when you are on a mount, you are invincible). That an the fact that all bosses pretty much do is spam special attacks *cough cough* Wall No. 8.  Some of the platforms are hollow so expect to jump up to a platform and it will not catch you. For a game that begs for money for anything extra, it sure doesn't do a good job polishing it. If I was a dev for this game, I would be updating this game at least once a week, this game needs some work, badly.

I've been playing for a couple of years and love the new characters that come out. If there were any downsides it would be the money it costs to permanently buy costumes and costume pieces as well as mounts and pets and the pvp that can put you up against a high level players. Besides that it's really fun and there are cool events that allow you to get these items I mentioned above for free although it usually involves alot of grinding.","May 19","true","86.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

Ill split my review in 2 parts; PVP and PVE, Aka. Players versus players and Player versus enemies (dongeons), which are the 2 parts of the experience this game as to offer.\n---------------------------------------\nLets start with PVE.\nPVE consist of a set of dongeons, you go to the dongeon corresponding to your level, get some quests done, kill some bosses, nothing really ground breaking. The part that i hate about PVE in this game is that its REALLY REALLY easy, your party will just steam roll everything even on hard difficulty, later it gets more challanging but thats 100h into the game (if you make it that far) and even then its repetitive as hell anyway.\nTL;DR PVE is easy, grindy and boring\n---------------------------------------\nNow for PVP.\nPVP is quite simple, you go in 1v1 2v2 or 3v3 and try to kill the enemy, nothing fancy or complex going on here, you kill people, which is totally fine, not all games need 12 pvp modes. But it gets ugly rather quickly, heres a list of whats wrong with pvp:\n1: The ranked system is based of your total win rate and ignore your level totally so having a lvl 40 face a lvl 70 happens really often and of course the lvl 40 gets pummeled.\n2: PVP is pay2win, not by a lot, but still is, let me explain. You are limited to 4 skills at all times, however you can pay 10$ to unlock a second skillset and have 8 instead, effectively giving you twice the flexibility in combat. If you want to go far in PVP you better have dat 10 bucks.\n3: Random items, there are some random items that spawn in the pvp arena which grants various buffs and bonuses, theres no problem here so far. The problem arise that you cant turn them off in RANKED pvp. Adding a element of randomness to a RANKED match is just rage inducing to say the least.\n4: Lag, nothing much to say here, it lag and that sucks.\n5: Balance issues; Some classes are just flat out broken and little is done in order to balance them.\nTL:DR PVP is pay2win, laggy and unbalanced.","November 4, 2014","false","341.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Not a terrible game. Not a good game. After a meager 2 years of playing this game myself (and a few hundred dollars), I can honestly say this game HAD a good conept at it's foundation. That element is still there, but you won't be able to enjoy due to a brutal pay-wall and tear-jerking balancing issues. This game should have stayed in beta for at LEAST another 2 years (from current date). if you're looking for a satisfying side-scrolling/arcade/RPG game, go play Super mario. What little character customization there is in this game is....well developed, and one of the most relevant pay-walls. Sadly, the "costumes" in this game aren't worth buying at all, as they pale in comparison to the fabeled ice Burner. If you're going to buy into this decent platformer, (I really can't call this an arcade-style game), don't watse your money on the costumes. Buy the B-Bar option, then buy hundreds of Ice Burners, and watch as your 1-in-200 odds steal your money away. IF, IF, you manage to get a full set for any one character, keep that character, and make all the other character-paths for that characters, as Ice Burner are the only shareable item your characters can swap between.\nMy 1-to-5 rating?\n1 Phenomenal concept! Early-game must have been alot of fun! As it is now however, I can no longer respect or enjoy this pay-wall. (Not game, pay-wall).\n(This is an opinion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/firefrostflare/recommended/237310/","firefrostflare","Hoshido Noble Rena","http://steamcommunity.com/id/firefrostflare/","11 products in account","Quick Overview: Fairly entertaining. The variety and art is nice and it has a sort of Smash Bros feel to it. I definitely don't recommend Elsword for someone who's expecting a lot. If you want a nice-looking anime RPG to play for a bit, though, I recommend it. (Of course, I've been playing this for a really long time, I'm not really speaking for myself)\n\nI started playing this game last year, before I found it on Steam, and I found myself playing it a LOT, for a few reasons.\n\n- I really loved the art, and I still do. The character design and art style is great.\n- The graphics are good. (They're pretty smooth.)\n- There's a lot of variety with the kind of class you want to choose. And even after you choose your class, there are (usually) three different branches/playstyles/"new job classes" you can take for your character, each one having their own attack range, difficulty to master, etc. If you get tired of one class, you can always make another. (with a max of 9 different character slots)\n- The plot is fairly entertaining, as well as the gameplay. The NPCs are great and I really love all of them.\n-The community on an overall is pretty okay. Generally the PvE community is really great and really friendly. (It can be an ENTIRELY different story for PvP, though, because the PvP community can be really toxic sometimes)\n\nAs much as I like it, though, there are quite a few cons to consider.\n\n- The play-to-win problem is pretty bad. KOG sets it up so that it takes hours of heavy grinding and keyboard smashing if you don't want to pay money/k-ching. Costumes are your best bet for stat increases, and your default one expires after 15 days. After that, you have to pay. A lot of the features are also money-locked. Skill Slot B? Unless you stick around for the Grand Chase Event, you have to pay. The really nice skills? You can either complete killer quests that are designed to make you pull your hair out and give up, or you have to pay.\n- As I said earlier, the plot is pretty entertaining at first. After a while, the quests get pretty old and it's pretty much just completing dungeon after dungeon for PvE, until you run out of dungeons. (There aren't that many, especially if you're going for a long-term game)\n- Pay-to-win is pretty relevant in PvP. I personally don't have a ton of experience with PvP. But, from my experience, if you don't want to spend money on costumes to up your stats, forget getting up to an SSS rank. (I don't play much PvP for that reason.)\n-The PvP community can be toxic. People are constantly complaining about how bad you are if you mess up, or if your'e lagging. It's pretty bad sometimes. You learn to deal with it (It doesn't stop me), but for some people it can be enough to ruin the game.\n\nFinal Words: Despite the flaws, I do still enjoy playing this game a fair amount. I find myself going back to it a lot, each time playing a different character. It's enjoyable, but I can't really recommend it to other people because of the cons.","February 26, 2015","false","107.2"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I personally love playing RF because you punch everything but it has a variety of play styles for everbody for example Deadly Chaser a job class for chung is the Guile of Elsword an Elsword is kinda the Ryu. Not only does it contibute to the fighting Genre of fans but also anime fans because it has that feel but not too much to make both sides even.\n\n+Classes-\nSo basically how it goes is you pick a character instead of a class (like a fighting game) an you proceed to level up the character and once you reach lvl 15 you get your first job change an after you reach 35 I believe you get your 2nd job change which is going to be your character from then on. each character will end up having 3 job classes and each one will be extremely different from the others, I'll use Raven as an example.\n\n-Reckless Fist is basically a character where he can take hits but aslo dish out damage aswell an uses his nasod arm instead of his sword doing high magical damage with super armor most of the time.\n\n-Blade Master focues around using his blade with very fast attacks before his opponent can but is very vulnerable to magical and a little bit to physical but he avoids this by being very mobile.\n\n-Veteran Commander is a cross between ranged and close combat basically a shoto character in a fighting game he isnt very tanky but he has good combos, good mobility and has high damaging specials making him a really dangerous class.\n\nOverall the class system is really good because there is something for everyone, If you like a powerhouse but like to be a little tanky go for Raven, if you like zoneing your oppoenent go Rena or Aisha, You wanna be in the opponents face almost all the time being very mobile and have good reach Ara, You just wanna go on full dmg not caring about defense Add is a good character to do that awell. Overall there is so much variety right now in elsword everyone can find a character.\n\n+Gamplay\n\nNow this is the thing every person in a fighting game cares about and also in MMOs the gameplay.\n-PVP\nright now Elsword has a balanced system after a certain amount of hits a persons KDR(Knock Down Rate) will go up an make them fall ending the combo, but people can work around this and do something called a KD reset where they hit the oppoent in the air most of the time and bring them back down before they fall to the ground allowing them to continue the combo. Now before you think the first hit decides the match, MP (Mana Points) is a resource which everyone has and once you reach a hundred you can hold Light or Heavy attack and Mana Break forcing youself to fall ending the combo but like any other fighting game being on the ground is a big dis-advantage so stay mobile is key in elsword there is no true block button aside from one of Elsword's actives(I mean the character not the game, confusing yes I know). But like most fighting games it comes down to skill who can utilize his kit better then the other player, but like all other PVP games there is something OP once in awhile right now Ara and Elesis are very strong character being very mobile an sometimes having super armor and MAJOR damage moves one example to prove this is that in all big heard tournaments in Elsword usally Ara's always win because one of her jobs is insanley powerful. With the recently added character Add he is probably the most damaging character once he gets his conditions set but he has 0 to none defense being half healthed usally in one combo. But everything is usally patched or buffs are given to other character to balance it out, Elsword does a pretty good job about this so dont judge the game by a few characters.\n\n-PVE\nThis is something Elsword is minorly known for but before you go saying, "I side scroller? Thats probably so easy!". You are wrong because in dungens later in the game become really challenging making you follow mechanics so you cant have an easy time. It also has insane raid bosses that have tricky patterns to memorize making it a real challenge, also seasonal raid bossess so you get something new most of the time. I will say that some dungens can be done pretty easy if you got or bought a "Mount" basically these things only use is for dungens doing insane damage for a set amount of time but it doesnt entirley break the game one because they are expensive and they only have 100 stamina an may only last around 5-6 minutes at a time. Overall Elsword PVP isnt boring because it most of the time comes up with something knew almost every month or so actually quicker then that sometimes, it is in no way easy or boring.\n\n+Graphics\n\nThey have simple graphics that look good, its not next gen realistic graphics its just simple but they somehow make it seem really appealing with their character designs and NPC design aswell, then the monsters arent those stupid over anime monsters that you see in other anime MMO RPGs, they actually make wood golems that wear a mask looking like they are hiding a scary face or something, overall this is short  and sweet to the point its nothing special but it isnt bad in the slightest way. If you want a comparison go look at Grand Chase compared to this game.\n\n+Final\n\nI am probably skipping some points but this has been written long enough the overall game is good its fair to people who just want to play the game and not spend money in some aspects its a little bit like "Pay-to-Win" but overall no people buy accesorys to make there character look cool and the buffs they get from them aren't that big so it doesnt make a huge difference, if you dont want to spend money thats fine Elsword gives pleny of oppurtinitys to get accesorys for your character absolutely free for just playing the game. It is in no way a pay to win game. Gameplay is solid most of the time aside from some character being a little OP an some character having unfair moves but I say again it comes down to raw skill...most of the time! PVE is not boring an doesnt lack excitment with over the top bosses like a giant mecha robot with wings that fire giant lasers at you an can back hand you and instant kill you. Graphics are nice and simple also are really well used, this game is awesome at keeping to a fighting game Genre and MMO aswell I recomend that you try it atleast once if your a fighting game fan, get to the 2nd job class get to around 50 and start pvping after you get your gear (which is really easy to get) an start playing, watch some videos of people comboing learn an I gurantee you will have fun.\n\nI forgot to mention so many things in this review but this is basically the meat of it all so if you think this sounds awesome to you go join the community because its growing very slowly each day,","August 4, 2014","true","289.2"," 28 of 54 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","28","54","0","0"

I found myself addicted to it only to realize how terrible the support team was. Game is totally fine except for the fact that 95% of the stuff in the NA version (North America) already existed in the original one (Korea's version) The Korean version is ages ahead and they probably have a way better support team that doesn't ask you for a better quality video of a hacker (720p apparently wasn't high enough). What else, this is not a Pay-To-Win for the most part. 50% of this is PVE and the other PVP so you probably won't worry about it all. In PVP you'll find yourself being frustrated by hackers and laggers (yeah lag is a big deal in this game) rather than people with tons of in-game cash items.

Futhermore, it still requires someone to actually pay for and support this kind of business.\n\nWhat makes this game worth playing is that it is the only one of it's kind out there for anime-style slice-em up fast paced PvE and PvP, had there been any other game similar to this, with better balance of prices and general management of the game I would have choosen that any day.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Gameplay is very stale and repetative, people say that "it is what you can expect from an Korean MMO" but it doesen't change the fact that it's a grind-fest. In order to level you are required to spam the same dungeons over and over again, and when you run out of story quests for your level, you get to farm fields until you level up, only do open your new story quests and spam the same dungeon over and over. Some bosses in the game are fun mechanicaly but most of them are hardly worth the mention. PvE is super easy, with the exception of some of the end game Secret Dungeons, which sometimes just feels like are made hard on few areas to make you buy resurrection stones.\n\nOverall, unless you want to burn your money, grind forever, I would find another game. However, as said before, there hardly exist anything like this out there yet. Which is too bad.\n\nThis game has a lot of great potential but it is wasted on KoG/KillerCombo trying to suck every penny out of you. While playing, you are often left with a feeling of being a mindless consumer, which is not a good feeling for any game to leave you with.\n","May 30, 2014","false","930.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is where you put what you have learn to use against other people, but I don't recommend you start pvping till you're level 35.\n\n2015 Update: There are now some balancing issues.

Its style is totally what I am into a heck lot. Though it may not work for everyone's liking.\nIn terms of gameplay it can be rather fun and different from other games you may play.\n\nCharacters:\nIn this game all play differently, each and every individual character and class has its distinct features and all tend to accelerate in different ways.The characters all have very diverse skills and playstyles, surely it will make you feel like you're playing a manga/comic.\nAside from the main topic, if you play in-game many people may complain (that's an NA server for you), however, each character has it's proper work around to getting through each task\n(including PvP which most people get salty at lol).\nI do have my fair share of getting frustrated, though after all it might just mean you may have been outplayed.\n(But this is a F2P game LOL, so expect overgeared players too... [Totally worth getting mad for sometimes])\n\nDungeons:\nI have to say the dungeons in Elsword are also rather diverse xD!\nThe scenery of each place tends to have a different feel.\nOh, and not to mention!... There is also a dungeon to run through all the bosses, IT IS NOT A CAKEWALK AT ALL.\n\nArena:\nThe arena (PVP) in this game is hilariously fun.\n\n1v1 being the most skillful played in. Doing 1v1 truly shows how skillful you are (Or how much you can spam x_x... that can be useful I guess?... Not entirely a good thing to see.)\n\n2v2 being the most competitive. While doing 2v2s brings on teamwork, making tactics important to play with.\n\n3v3 being the most fun and chaotic xD! The amount of spammage is hilarious and you may not even be able to know what is going on, it's great, yet annoying. If you're too serious then it may not be as fun as it seems.(This may stand for everything in-game though, but it's best to have fun in PvP than get frustrated.)","November 17, 2013","true","674.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/recommended/237310/","ximenes","Naked Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/","220 products in account","An interesting MMO. Sure there are other side-scrolling multiplayer games, like Awesomenauts, but that focuses more on team versus matches. With Elsword you have quality visuals, done in an anime-esque cell shading style, character voices are done in Japanesse (text is in English). What's different here is that the vast majority of the time, you don't need your mouse. All combat is controlled from the keyboard, from movement to attacks and the mouse only seems to be used for menus. Also, this game uses a Stamina system; killing monsters in dungeons uses stamina, the more players running that dungeon, the less you use. Stamina refills daily (3am PST), but is unlimited on weekends, and honestly, you can get at least 3-4 hours of dungeon time in on your daily stamina, so it's not a huge deal.\n\nWhat can be a bit confusing are the costume pieces from the real-money store. While they're nice and they can make your character look decent, they all seem to be limited-time use items. I may be wrong about that, but when you look at them the price is listed twice, one for a 30-day use and one permanent for 2x the 30-day price. You can get by without them, as they only apply stat boost on top of whatever your getting from armor/weapons/ect.\n\nThat aside, the game is highly addictive. However, for most quest you seem to have to repeat dungeons over at least 2-3 times, often at specific difficulty levels or higher, but said dungeons have 3 difficulty levels and you can always just join a random group to take on the highest levels or run solo if you're feeling up to it. Dungeons are also split up, with some not letting you progress till all enemies are dead. One gripe I found was in the Skill Notebook quest where I had to run two dungeons over and over again in order to kill one enemy type because I need to collect 20 items, which were rare drops (I'd get 2-3 per run, max with some runs giving none). But most times you're asked to collect 20+ of an item you get it from every avaliable enemy kill, so it's only a problem in specific quests where the item is listed as Rare.\n\nIn-game currency is easy to come by. At only 6 hours in I'd already accumulated over 300k, and probably spent even more upgrading my equipment as well, since you can get a lot of use out of equipment via enchanting, enhancing and repairing before you need to get something new.\n\nI haven't delved too deeply into crafting, but item/weapon enhancement is done two different ways, each adding diffrent things, so the system there is robust enough to allow for customization to play prefferences.\n\nIn all it's a solid game with solid mechanics, detailed characters, both NPC and your own. My only real gripe is that unless you pay K-Ching (the games real-world money) you're limited to only 3 item quick-slots and 4 skill quick-slots, you're inventory is also limited, with 8 slot upgrades costing 200 K-Ching. However, 1 K-Ching is ~$.01, so it's not that big a cost (This is based off the 500 K-Ching pack costing $5US). But be warned that such upgrades are bought on a per character basis, so it costs about $14 per character to get +16 inventory spaces and all 8 skill quick slots, but you can play just as well with the stock free setup.","December 6, 2013","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It'll be lots of fun. However as you progress, many issues become glaringly obvious and makes the game less fun.\n\nWhile this game is quite fun, it easily begins to lose its charm over time. In the beginning, it's all pretty fun, leveling and learning about skills and everything. But there are so many small things that form into a big issue. The amount of grinding is way too much. Yes, I expected grinding from a MMORPG, but this is too much. For a class advancement, expect to give out a little money or run three to five dungeons over and over and over on the premise of a rare drop. Want to be able to use more than 4 skills at once? Pay up for 4 more slots! Want to be able to use more options? Pay for more slots. Inventory? Pay up. There's no way to get them without paying unless you wait and wait hoping for an event that allows you to earn them. PvE is easily repetitive and uninteresting after a while, and PvP is broken. If you run a dungeon, you'll likely have one player riding a paid mount and kills almost everything before you can get to it. PvP? Not including the amount of laggers you can find, but to even stand a chance most of the time you need to pay money. See a cool looking costume that also gives stats? $30. Per costume. And all costumes have a cheaper price, but they're only temporary. Many PvP items that hold an advantage are either temporary, or you have to pay for them. It's quite ridiculous how much they want you to pay, and that's not even all. Not only that, but the older characters are usually useless compared to the newer characters. You wanted to play Elsword, the main character? Well too bad, you're going to have to try harder because you likely picked a weak character compared to, say, Add or Lu/Ciel. I tried to like this game, I made some good friends on it, but it doesn't seem worth it.

Does it have PVP and if it does is it well ballanced? Can I see my character fully instead of just the top of it's head? and most important, is it fun?\nIn my opinion Elsword has everything an MMO should, awesome fast paced gameplay, unique character styles and combat, beautiful scenery, and blood pumping PvP action. And this for free!\nDispite the gender locked characters that all start out the same, you are somehow able to still feel unique and different from any other player. Be it cosmetically or combat wise. You don't ahve to spend DAYS!!! trying to level up just to get past a stage. And admittedly, the dungeons can and will get kinda repetitive, this happenes in all gaming, the only way to avoid it is to keep coming out with new missions and updates. Which, as far as I know, Elsword does.\n\nRemember what I said about balanced PvP? Well this isn't exactly the best example. While it may seem impossible for a level 4 to absolutely destroy a level 70, I gotta say in Elsword, this isn't all that uncommon. What I like about ES's PvP is that it gives all players a chance, if they are skilled. What I don't like is that the new characters are automatically stronger and more efficient, which, outside of context makes perfect sence right? New meaning improved and more efficient. But honestly, its like you don't even need skill anymore, I normally play as the star character Elsword himself, but I tried one day as a new character named Ara. at level 10 I effortlessly conquered a level 64. and don't get me wrong, this was an A class player, he had experience! but Ara is absolutely unstoppable and has seemingly endless combos, thats absurd to me. But like I said, if you are more skilled than the other you will win.\nAll in All, Elsword is a great game to play if you have patience and are a wiz at combos. I'd always recomend it to anyone who calls themself a gamer.

Move to either the left or the right (depending on where the game wants you to go) and kill everything in your way. With 8 characters each with multiple job changes for each to keep combat exciting with more skills added to the skill tree. As the game progresses the dungeons get harder, monsters get stronger and the importance of a team is almost required by level 40+. As a person that has used all of the classes, I can firmly say that each has it's advantages and drawbacks, some more than others of course, but that does with any game. This is not your typical MMO with healer, tank, and DPS.

Get on the bandwagon today to catch up on one of the mainstream Overpowered items that the game could reward players to! Cause Mainstream. Good news, hibernating players who haven't play in months now congest the server happily, cheers, to a great human traffic event/updates.\n-wanna do events with rich rewards and giveaways? guess what, they get taken by alternate charaters. If you only main 1 character and never play anyone else, you lose alot, the game just wants more of your time. Heck your prizes you gave might even end up given away to the same players that uses 2 different username.\n-at most times, when interact with old players, they open no chance for new players to introduce theirselves into any group interested in, even if the new players do get in, we get forgery no matter how our approach goes, it is absolutely way better to stick in a group of new players together instead.\n\nSingle player perspective: Elsword will be your last MMO you've ever play in your whole life. No matter what you'd do, being the top, being the worst, being invisible, no1 would care in the end. Just play it as a single player, you don't need pvp/guild/people to talk to, its worthless itself.\n\nMultiplayer perspective: Elsword will be an MMO that you CAN NEVER FORGET and would definitely introduce you to many socialable friends of many type that are better than IRL.\n\nLimits beyond measure dear adventurer...

Just play it as a single player, you don't need pvp/guild/people to talk to, its worthless itself.\n\nMultiplayer perspective: Elsword will be an MMO that you CAN NEVER FORGET and would definitely introduce you to many socialable friends of many type that are better than IRL.\n\nLimits beyond measure dear adventurer... Limits, beyond, measure.\n\n18/18 to El peeps who plays because of rena and ara.","November 15, 2015","true","069.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bantaaaaa/recommended/237310/","Bantaaaaa","DefinitelyNotTim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bantaaaaa/","84 products in account","This is a pretty good game for an anime RPG, It's has a colourful design, lovable characters and it's overall fun. sometimes your inventory slots can be full the more you progress through the game and you would need to pay 'Ka-Ching' (the online currency in the game) to unlock more spaces. But thats not the main use of Ka-Ching though, you can buy costumes and stuff to make your character unique, and you don't just have 1, you can have up to 3 or more slots by default and you can expand the number of slots depending if you are willing to pay a tiny amount of money to gain an extra character slot. (which I did, because I wanted to try out all the characters)\nQuests can sometimes be repetitive, but if you have friends or party members to do dungeons with you, then it should be a walk in the park. It's not hard to play, the turtorial is very clear and the quests are simple, so there is nothing to worry to get used to playing this game.\nI really do enjoy this game overall, the only flaw it has that it limits you for inventory slots which can sometimes be annoying since you have to sell some stuff to get more room, I'm not too bothered since the stuff I sell are low level items.\nBut don't be discouraged to play this game, it is free-to-play game after all and you can play through the game happily without spending a single penny like I did.","March 1, 2014","true","16.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Extra item slots, extra skill slots, the coupling mechanic, costumes, etc. This game can be played without spending a dime, but asks you BUY THIS TO UNLOCK THAT everywhere.\n\nThe environment design is also a bit of a clusterf&ck and can give you eyestrain. Bright color palette and busy advertisments littered everywhere TO BUY THIS NEW PACK, coupled with 20 players bouncing around on screen makes it overall visually chaotic.\n\nPerhaps most insulting thing in this game is how it dangles cool features to new comers that have expiration dates on them. I picked Elesis because of her cute battle dress design only to come back a week later to realize it had been stripped away because of the expiration date. OF COURSE I could reaquire it by SPENDING MONEY. Yet, there is a way to aquire currency without spending money by TAKING SURVEYS! Even the "legit" free surveys sponsored by the developers is like throwing time and effort down a rathole, so much that you'll want to spend money to spite them. But I digress. In short, like pretty much all free to play games, Elsword has many ways to try and get one's money, but money isnt really necessary to play and enjoy it.\n\nThe story is almost negligible. Some sprites pop up and talk about some bandits in a forest or some dragon in a cave.. meh I didnt care. It does not present the story in an interesting way at all. No cinematics. No incenstive to care at all about any kind of narrative.\n\nBut the positive I can is that it is 2D and fairly simple to progress and level up. The community is pretty friendly too. Once you gain your skills and a strong enough weapon, it can get addictive. Also the music is quite catchy. Found myself humming it for a while. The quality of the music feels somewhat un matching to the quality of the game.\n\nMy verdict: Its casual enough to pick and waste some time in if you like being a cute chibi character, but if you are looking for some intense gameplay or interesting strats, just move on to something else.","July 26, 2014","false","21.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I mean you you are trying to prettify your character to make it unique as compared to all of the other similar characters. But if looks don't matter go ahead and spend the money.. Unlike other Nexon Korea game, say maplestory, every equippable item has the option to buy permanent costume pieces, much in the way that Vindictus (Mabinogi Heroes) does, with the expirable version costing less based on duration.","December 18, 2014","false","68.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So if you enjoyed that, you might like this.\n\nFrom the begining it can get qutie repititve really fast. It's not like most MMOs where you have an abundance of quests to do, rather, you only get a few quests per level. This can get pretty frustrating past level 40, as it forces you to either dungeon grind or field grind (Fields are areas with monsters that you can do repeat quests over and over. It's very stamina efficenet on weekdays, and gives a fair amount of xp.) Ereda Island is also a nice alternative if you're looking for PVE mixed with PVP. It's stamina efficent and it gives good exp.\n\nThis game does have a stamina system. When you run out of stamina, you can no longer dungeon or gain exp from monsters in field. While most would be turned off by this, I personally don't find myself ever running out of stamina. This might be because I enjoy playing plenty of characters though, so I switch often. On weekends, stamina is unlimited.\n\nI can't really think of many things that are bad about Elsword, persay. Some would call it pay2win, due to the only way you can aquire costumes and such is through the cash shop. Plenty of players are able to play with no trouble and never spend a dime on the game. I have personally cashed, but I do remember what it was like not to cash as well. Not being able to cash limits some things, but I wouldn't say by much. You could also buy KC (The cash shop currency) from other players, but our economy is quite terrible right now so that may not be an option. Whether you cash or not does not limit your ability though, and those who think like that are silly.\n\nI think PVP is the one reason why I think this game is great. The combo system and how everything works together is very interesting. Unfortunately, many people are quite rude in PVP and those who are considered the top players have a large ego. Prepare for the salt if you decide to PVP. (I do not recommend PVPing before at LEAST 45 if you decide to, due to level differences. If you choose to PVP before then is at your own risk.)\n\nhttp://elwiki.net/ is a great place for game information if you're looking to have questions answered. You can always try the game's forums as well. People are usually kind there, just be careful on how you word things.","August 15, 2013","true","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

People say "ohhh but you have to PAY to get more skills ohhh" and whine about it. They act like it is IMPOSSIBLE to win in pvp without 4 extra skills, like you have absolutely no chance and you're at such a low disadvantage that it isn't even worth trying. Let me teach you something about Elsword Mr. 30 Hours. It may seem like some characters are better than others, like how Lu/Ciel is 2 characters instead of 1, so there is no way you can beat them, but if you played every class for every character, you would know that they are completely balanced. No matter who you choose, you can still beat somebody who is the opposite character. Like a Physical Attacker like Elsword has the same chance at beating a Magical Attacker like Rena like how an Elesis has the same chance at beating an Add. People only say "new characters are OP" because they have a different mechanic than others. Go ahead, prove me wrong. When Ara came out: "OP cuz hits too much" Elesis: "OP cuz too much strength" Add: "OP cuz range" LuCiel: "OP cuz 2 instead of 1" Rose: "OP cuz 4 weapons" I think i made my point. I do recomend it to people who are willing to PLAY THE GAME to get good, instead of wasting money to get 4 skills, then complain.","June 4","true","707.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

But I do not reccomend this version... while it may say I've been playing the game for 53 hours, I should note I first started playing Elsword as far back as Closed Beta for NA.\n\nThe problem with this version of Elsword is being it has slowly creeped from something you didn't need to cash to play, into something where it seems your credit card is becoming more and more of a vital tool to keep up, speccialy if you wish to remotely even buy anything in the market that's been inflated to a point any in-game ED(Gold) you get will only really be spent on NPC services.\n\nThe host as well hasn't proved shy of converting free features into cash features. Skill Notes for example have been converted into a mostly cash feature, they improve skills you can learn in some way or another. But unelss you wish to get a skill note for a lousy active skill nobody chooses for very good reasons. Due to how the skill trees work in this game, you often won't even pick up the worse skill in a choice since picking Skill X will lock Skill Y entirely, making many if not all quest earned skill notes left unused. (If you plan to play the Korea version, this point is null as skill notes are a mob drop over there.)\n\nAnd then going back onto the economy... an in-game gamble box will give cash players many of what they'll need.. and more. So don't expect to be able to sell your rarer drops to them except for Secret Dungeon drops. This is because the gamble box gives them much more of the same items you can find in-game form mob drops... without the grind. This has resulted in an in-game economy where only cashers can trade with cashers and very few if any F2Ps can actually buy anything of note worth, the aforementioend skill notes bought with KC can be traded after being bought... but the ED to KC rate will make it far too much ingame gold for one out of 6 skill note slots..\n\nWhile I do enjoy the game itself as well... a game mechanics wise and as a fun arcadey co-op beat em' up, I have to advise players to stay away from Elsword NA. Look into other servers instead, I'ms ure if you google a bit you can discover many other servers of which may be a far superior alternative.","July 31, 2014","false","53.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The cosmetics are nice.  Oh and Chung, the gun toting character with a huge cannon, is awesome :3","July 30, 2013","true","192.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

So if you enjoyed that, you might like this.\n\nFrom the begining it can get qutie repititve really fast. It's not like most MMOs where you have an abundance of quests to do, rather, you only get a few quests per level. This can get pretty frustrating past level 40, as it forces you to either dungeon grind or field grind (Fields are areas with monsters that you can do repeat quests over and over. It's very stamina efficenet on weekdays, and gives a fair amount of xp.) Ereda Island is also a nice alternative if you're looking for PVE mixed with PVP. It's stamina efficent and it gives good exp.\n\nThis game does have a stamina system. When you run out of stamina, you can no longer dungeon or gain exp from monsters in field. While most would be turned off by this, I personally don't find myself ever running out of stamina. This might be because I enjoy playing plenty of characters though, so I switch often. On weekends, stamina is unlimited.\n\nI can't really think of many things that are bad about Elsword, persay. Some would call it pay2win, due to the only way you can aquire costumes and such is through the cash shop. Plenty of players are able to play with no trouble and never spend a dime on the game. I have personally cashed, but I do remember what it was like not to cash as well. Not being able to cash limits some things, but I wouldn't say by much. You could also buy KC (The cash shop currency) from other players, but our economy is quite terrible right now so that may not be an option. Whether you cash or not does not limit your ability though, and those who think like that are silly.\n\nI think PVP is the one reason why I think this game is great. The combo system and how everything works together is very interesting. Unfortunately, many people are quite rude in PVP and those who are considered the top players have a large ego. Prepare for the salt if you decide to PVP. (I do not recommend PVPing before at LEAST 45 if you decide to, due to level differences. If you choose to PVP before then is at your own risk.)\n\nhttp://elwiki.net/ is a great place for game information if you're looking to have questions answered. You can always try the game's forums as well. People are usually kind there, just be careful on how you word things.","July 31, 2014","true","089.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

That however should be no reason to not try this game. Besides being repetative Elsword has plenty of features in game to make the game more fun and also entertaining. One Feature is character customization. The game has many In-Game shops where you can buy accessories and diffrent types of armor for your character. If thats not not enough the game also has a cash shop where you can buy many kinds of costumes  and items that give you mounts and many peices of gear that helps you make many diffrent character customizations. Another two features is pvp and the skill tree. Elsword has a solid base for pvp that allows you to create your own combinations of combos that can knock your opponent down with lightning ast attks to attking your enemy while their in the air with swift skills or slashes from the characters blade. with many skills and combinations to chose from the pvp has a uniqueness of its own. For players that want to get married in game there is a marriage system. The marriage sytem is broken into 4 steps. first you need to find the person you want your character to marry. afterwards you need to buy the couples ring from the cash shop (The item can only be found in the CashShop alone).once you give the ring to the person you want to marry you must wait 3 days (this time can be used to get to know eachother better ). when the time is up you can buy the marriage pakage which will have a certain number of invatations you can send to your friends and a item for using one of the chappels in the game. The final feature i'm going to be speaking of is the world aspect of the game since with all due respect i don't want to waste any more of peoples time.the world aspect may be that it is a side-scroller game but that doesn't mean it doesn't have anything for you to do. this multiplayer game will have you in a single player instance to start with in the beginning but there is more to it. after that one instance you are sent into the open world. you can meet many people, make friends, even for you people that struggle with the dungeons or quest there is a large community of people to help you get through the game.","July 26, 2014","true","90.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

I'm not gonna go so deep into things but I'll make this enough to know what's going on.\n\nBeen playing this for 2 years before I joined Steam and it used to be a fun game, but went downhill ever since CBS was released. There's been less and less balance between the characters since then and it's nearing a breaking point. to avoid most of the headache, don't do PvP. You won't be able to get a few items by avoiding it, but it's all mainly for looks anyway.\n\nDungeons to me are fine at first, but get really tedious after a while because it's the same tactic. Beat the crap out of everything as fast as possible, rinse, repeat. Very few bosses either need a strategy or force you to divert your attention. They have fixed the leveling issue a bit with the new random missions, but it's still a long grind in order to hit the level cap, which needs to be done if you wanna be as powerful as possible.\n\nSpeaking of power, this game is free to play, but is so Cash Shop geared that you can put tons of money into it and become nearly unbeatable. There's also players that pride themselves on this stuff, so that's even more fun removed from the game and the reason why no one really does another thing called Ereda Island despite there being less hackers in the game.\n\nWhat I do like however is very little. I like how the game looks and some of the gameplay, but it's (again) overshadowed by the pay to win crap and lack of balance. The soundtrack isn't bad, but hearing it after a while, you may just mute it and get your own music. Most impressive looking places are the Hunting Fields and trust me, you'll see a lot of them given the grinding issue. I do like how the characters are designed too, along with the various looks you can give them even without putting a single cent into the game.\n\nSo, what do I think overall? It's decent if you don't mind the grinding and don't play PvP. But it's gone downhill so much that this is mainly to kill time or play dress-up. You can make friends, but you WILL make enemies too given the community. And in game crap is expensive, but smart players can get around that. All in all, it's a good idea gone bad and I can't really recommend it. Trust me, there's a lot more negative things I can mention about this game that I didn't put in...","November 24, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

He's great in PvP since he's great for ranged and close-up combat with his cannon, Destroyer.\n\n---\n\nPros:\n-Excellent gameplay!\n-Friendly GMs~ (You go, GMs Cuddles and Pebbles!)\n-Neat events!\n-An Awesome community that really helps!\n\nNow if you care about fashion in-game...\n-The costumes are really cool, cute, pretty, beautiful... you name it!\n\n---\n\nCons:\n-Rude players in PvP.\n-Stamina goes down during week days.

The reason i say this is because Elsword has a stamina system that goes down whenever you kill monsters in the fields, or when a monster dies in a dungeon.  Stamina is reset every night and all character's have seperate stamina bars, so if you run out of stamina on one character, just switch to another.  Also the maximum characters per account (without buying any) has increased from 3 to i believe 6.  A problem is that there is no character cuztomization if you dont spend real money, and the job advancement clothes they give you only last up to 2 weeks before getting deleted.  This makes some characters (like chung in my opinion) look really stupid, most others look fine though.  some events have given out costumes but these are rare.  The combat is nice and fluid as you can chain abilities with combos, and there are about 16 abilities per character but you can only have four of them on your skill bar, you can sawp them but they only give you enough SP (skill points) to max out around 6 so choose wisely (at each advancement you get a free potion that givs you back all your SP).  For i think 10 dollars you can unlock 4 extra abilit slots for one character,  but most abilities take 100 mana and your max is 300 so this is not essential to beat dungeons.  dungeons are easy early on but they get harder to beat later in the game, the way they do this is kind of wierd.  Good healing consumables have to be bought or can be crafted with materials you get in dungeons (either way works) but after level 40 it becomes a struggle to stay alive.  its works like this, there are around 30 to maybe 50 enimes per entire dungeon after level 40, my one character has around 100k hp but a single enemy hit can hit me 1k to possibly 10k depending on what it is so killing enemies efficiently and not getting hit is the name of the game.  life items can be found in boxes in the dungeons but these are used upon touching them are not abundent enough to sustain you through the entire game, on top of that the only way to get revives are though field bosses (rare to get revives from them), events, or buying them with real money.  its hard to explain but PvP's are decieded by whoever can chain more combos with abilities without knocking down the opponent (this sorta goes for PvE to but on a lesser scale), unless your in a 3v3 match and have team mates to interrupt the combo (start playing the game and it will make more sense).  i have friends who i play with so i dont interact with the community that much but guilds are the way to go to socialize as dungeons are usually too crazy with all the fighting to type to each other.  last thing i would like to point out is any dungeon can be entered from anywhere and you can que for 4 player parties or just start instantly with whoever is in your party.  all in all the game has its cons but being a free to play game it is worth a try as they are adding new content on a fairly regualr bases. now if youll exscuse me my fingers hurt.","June 6, 2014","true","338.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Granted if you play dungeons with other players, the bar decreases at a much slower rate. Once depleted you cannot access dungeons, but you can still go around in the hub world and grind at the fields against generic enemies and the occasional field boss that appears about every 10-20 min if people in the feild are defeating the generic enemies.\n\n-Outfits....you can forget about full custimization freedom, most of the awesome stuff is in the store (as in IRL cash). Lvling up after lvl 34 starts to drag so be ready to take on side quests or grind at the fields.\n\n-Lastly, you will be given a quest to change job class when you reach the appropiate lvl. this isnt usually a problem, but the tick is that when you take on the second job class you will be asked to obtain a certain amount of an item that, from what ive seen, has a drop rate of about 5-8%. Depending on the character and job class path taken, you will be asked to find an item in the varrying amounts of 10-100 (research your character if you have the time and want to put in the effort for them).\n\nPros:\n\n-Anime style 2d beatem up that can provide hours of enjoyment. Sure the cons may look bad, but ive had this game for two years and recently linked it with steam.\n\n-While you dont have full customization freedom, you have the oppertunity to find armor that looks different and cooler compared to the generic drops. They are harder to get, but get the full set and you will look cool AND get stat bonuses.\n\n-Events are frequent and sometimes give you the option of obtaining and keeping an item that will be available only within that time period. first you obtain a temperary version then engage event quests to make the item permanent. Keep an eye on the news page as this will alert you to anything of the sort and go for it as soon as you see an event like so. Usually if an event goes on and offers an outfit or costume of some type with the added oppertunity to make it permanent, it will require you to complete and event quest nearly the entire month/week/etc in order to obtain the sufficiant quest rewards to do so, but in the end its worth it, because you didnt pay a thing.\n\n-while it costs IRL money to obtain expansion to your inventory and of the like, you will not need it. What you have is enough unless you are a horder, in which case you may need some help.\n\n-P2W (Pay-to-Win)? Nope. While you can buy items in the shop, you can obtain gear just as equal or better through your hard work. Accessory drops are also available in most dungeons (at an unbeliveable drop rate for some) that will give you stats boosts and give your character some added cosmetic look.","June 6, 2014","true","105.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unlike the automatic hack-and-slash of some side-scrolling MMORPG's, Elsword requires you to manually press the buttons and connect the attacks yourself. At the beginning, it might be boring and uneventful, but as you progress through the levels, the dungeons and the towns...you'll find that things do get a 'little' harder. And while you may have to grind more and more to get to the next level, it's worth it. WORTH. You know why?\n\nThe PVP.\n\nThe PVP in this damn game is phenomenal, and it's what hooked me into Elsword in the first place. Yes, it might seem easy in first glance, but experiencing it for yourself brings you to a whole new world. It's fresh. Exciting. Exhilarating. And most of all...it's addicting. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I'm not kidding when I say: Prepare your ♥♥♥♥, here comes the butthurt-whenever you step into Arena 1v1 and 3v3, or sparring. It's not easy. Not at all. It's hard, and it will test you and keep pushing you beyond your limits. It pushed me beyond my limits. Consistently. Just when I thought I couldn't get any better, I did. It's so competitive yet strangely casual at the same time that it's surreal. Honestly, for me, the reason that I keep coming back to Elsword despite the grinding and the fact that things do get a little repetitive, is the PVP.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Download it now! Even if you might not like it, just keep it and PVP once in a while to feel adrenaline pumping throughout your veins. There's nothing like it.","March 16, 2014","true","256.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNamesBillCipher/recommended/237310/","TheNamesBillCipher","Big Bear with Killer Hair","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNamesBillCipher/","76 products in account","To start off, let's do a quick summary of what Elsword is:\nElsword is a Anime Styled, Side Scrolling, Free to Play, Class-based RPG Fighter in which you are given the choice of 9 different characters to fight with, level up and "evolve" so to say. Each character has different skill trees which can be chosen to fit your personal gameplay style.\nLike to play as a Free Knight and acquire pyromancer abilities? Choose Elesis! Like being a Tank for your team? Choose Chung! How about being an Archer to attack from long range? Choose Rena!\n\nThis selection of characters is great for all kinds of players and helps broaden the audience for this game. It has typical elements which you can expect from an RPG: Armour, Special weapons, potions, grinding etc. These elements fit well into the world of Elsword, helping you defeat bosses in dungeons to earn XP and gain better armour and weapons!\n\nSpeaking of bosses, there may be repetition with such bosses as Banthus but besides that, they are both challenging and rewarding. The game itself seems to get very addicting when you are trying to level up your character and get them to their next form or "evolution" as I've said before. The stamina bar is used to prevent addiction. This bar is gradually used up as you complete dungeons and once you are out of stamina you cannot do any more dungeons for the day. Stamina is refilled every day though as well as having unlimited stamina at weekends so all you fanatics can play to your hearts content.\n\nIn closing, I believe Elsword is a fun, vibrant and addicting game and I recommend it to all of you anime or RPG lovers.","April 21, 2014","true","26.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

It's essentially a game that functions much like Dungeon Fighter: Online (DFO) and other old school beat'em ups except with the 3d twist. Although you can choose between controller and keyboard, every prompt will be chosen in keyboard fashion resulting in you being forced into using the keyboard option.\nThis MMO is the epitome of what F2P MMOs have become in this day and age from the copy-pasted HUD to the terrible graphics that were created in (probably) Blender.\nThe combat is stale and uninspiring and in the first level of the game I found myself doing over two thousand damage, showing how bad the damage inflation already is. I can only imagine doing hundreds of thousands of damage at a later part of the game despite the amount of damage being negligible as long as it's the same percent damage (i.e. they could scale it to far lower numbers but because they didn't do so, it shows that they care very little for game balance and that it will only worsen over time) Also the quests, inventory, and dungeon system are all quite confusing and the party I played the game with wanted to puke all over themselves after only five minutes of handling the UI.\nThere is absolutely no customibility in the game besides the skill tree\nPvP evidently exists in the game, but man... when they can't even do PvE how could I trust a company to do PvP?\n\nMy final words would have to be, DO NOT PLAY THIS.\nAlso we need to get around to e-mailing Nexon to get DFO back. It was a really good game if you could get over how god-awful Nexon servers were. Maybe I should mail Gabe too.","November 30, 2013","false","0.6"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","1"

When i played during the summer the rare and good iceburner top and bottom peices would go up for an average amount from 100-500mil, the gloves and shoes would only be 10-130 million in game currency. But when I checked back after the new expansion for the new character Ara, the iceburner peices for her were way too expensive for a average person. One pair of gloves can go up to 400mil-700mil, top and bottom peices can go up to 1 BILLION!! That's insanely a crazy amount of in game currency. OF COURSE by just playing the game and finishing the dungeons will not give you that crazy amount of ED(in game currency). How do people buy those peices? Goldbuying isn't allowed in this game like all other mmorpgs. So they buy "k-ching" real money currency and sell them ingame to get those ED. However, you can always choose to use your kching and open boxes and have a 5% of chance getting those peices. If it weren't for the economy right now to ruin this game, this game is one of the best sidescrolling games if you play with your friends. It's very fun and it will keep you updated.

And while you may have to grind more and more to get to the next level, it's worth it. WORTH. You know why?\n\nThe PVP.\n\nThe PVP in this damn game is phenomenal, and it's what hooked me into Elsword in the first place. Yes, it might seem easy in first glance, but experiencing it for yourself brings you to a whole new world. It's fresh. Exciting. Exhilarating. And most of all...it's addicting. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I'm not kidding when I say: Prepare your ♥♥♥♥, here comes the butthurt-whenever you step into Arena 1v1 and 3v3, or sparring. It's not easy. Not at all. It's hard, and it will test you and keep pushing you beyond your limits. It pushed me beyond my limits. Consistently. Just when I thought I couldn't get any better, I did. It's so competitive yet strangely casual at the same time that it's surreal. Honestly, for me, the reason that I keep coming back to Elsword despite the grinding and the fact that things do get a little repetitive, is the PVP.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Download it now! Even if you might not like it, just keep it and PVP once in a while to feel adrenaline pumping throughout your veins. There's nothing like it.","March 16, 2014","true","256.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNamesBillCipher/recommended/237310/","TheNamesBillCipher","Big Bear with Killer Hair","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNamesBillCipher/","76 products in account","To start off, let's do a quick summary of what Elsword is:\nElsword is a Anime Styled, Side Scrolling, Free to Play, Class-based RPG Fighter in which you are given the choice of 9 different characters to fight with, level up and "evolve" so to say. Each character has different skill trees which can be chosen to fit your personal gameplay style.\nLike to play as a Free Knight and acquire pyromancer abilities? Choose Elesis! Like being a Tank for your team? Choose Chung! How about being an Archer to attack from long range? Choose Rena!\n\nThis selection of characters is great for all kinds of players and helps broaden the audience for this game. It has typical elements which you can expect from an RPG: Armour, Special weapons, potions, grinding etc. These elements fit well into the world of Elsword, helping you defeat bosses in dungeons to earn XP and gain better armour and weapons!\n\nSpeaking of bosses, there may be repetition with such bosses as Banthus but besides that, they are both challenging and rewarding. The game itself seems to get very addicting when you are trying to level up your character and get them to their next form or "evolution" as I've said before. The stamina bar is used to prevent addiction. This bar is gradually used up as you complete dungeons and once you are out of stamina you cannot do any more dungeons for the day. Stamina is refilled every day though as well as having unlimited stamina at weekends so all you fanatics can play to your hearts content.\n\nIn closing, I believe Elsword is a fun, vibrant and addicting game and I recommend it to all of you anime or RPG lovers.","April 21, 2014","true","26.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

It's essentially a game that functions much like Dungeon Fighter: Online (DFO) and other old school beat'em ups except with the 3d twist. Although you can choose between controller and keyboard, every prompt will be chosen in keyboard fashion resulting in you being forced into using the keyboard option.\nThis MMO is the epitome of what F2P MMOs have become in this day and age from the copy-pasted HUD to the terrible graphics that were created in (probably) Blender.\nThe combat is stale and uninspiring and in the first level of the game I found myself doing over two thousand damage, showing how bad the damage inflation already is. I can only imagine doing hundreds of thousands of damage at a later part of the game despite the amount of damage being negligible as long as it's the same percent damage (i.e. they could scale it to far lower numbers but because they didn't do so, it shows that they care very little for game balance and that it will only worsen over time) Also the quests, inventory, and dungeon system are all quite confusing and the party I played the game with wanted to puke all over themselves after only five minutes of handling the UI.\nThere is absolutely no customibility in the game besides the skill tree\nPvP evidently exists in the game, but man... when they can't even do PvE how could I trust a company to do PvP?\n\nMy final words would have to be, DO NOT PLAY THIS.\nAlso we need to get around to e-mailing Nexon to get DFO back. It was a really good game if you could get over how god-awful Nexon servers were. Maybe I should mail Gabe too.","November 30, 2013","false","0.6"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","1"

I feel like PvP is ruining the game,at least for me.But don't get me wrong, It wasn't a bad idea to add PvP and I also think the game would've been boring without it, It gives players a break from grinding and lets you fight other players online.BUT there is a ton of ♥♥♥♥ wrong with it. Is it just me, or whenever I get into a match, HALF of the people I get have Time Warner and they start ♥♥♥♥ing teleporting like ♥♥♥♥, they take an HOUR to flinch, and they freeze for like an eternity. If you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet, please just do me and the rest of the Elsword players a favor by getting ATLEAST DECENT INTERNET. I don't want to wait a ♥♥♥♥ing hour for you to load in.And why in the name of SWEET BLACK BABY JESUS do you blame your lag on me? I'm sorry you lack good internet, but don't blame it on other people. There's also the ALL wonderful Elsword PvP players who mostly have a IQ of a rock and are ♥♥♥♥ING hypocrites.They are SO very nice to me,using overused insults like "faget,no0b,spamer,hackrer,lagerr " just stop.Kill yourself and uninstall the game. Let me just say this.If you do something nooby to ME, I WILL return the favor.And I swear to Jesus Christ if you ♥♥♥♥♥ about it, I WILL STAPLE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING BALLSACK OR BREASTS [depending on your gender] TO THE CEILING. I try to play the game, BUT HOW IN THE TAINTDICK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT WHEN THE MAJORITY OF NA PLAYERS HAS TIME WARNER INTERNET AND LACK INTELLIGENCE.I'm so close of moving to KR, because they have a better economy then this so ♥♥♥♥ place called 'MURICA! But Elsword isn't a bad game and you should get it.Because minus the PvP and players,it is really a fun game to play. I'll still play the game, it just sucks that I and other people have to deal with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Elsword, for me, is an 8/10.

That however should be no reason to not try this game. Besides being repetative Elsword has plenty of features in game to make the game more fun and also entertaining. One Feature is character customization. The game has many In-Game shops where you can buy accessories and diffrent types of armor for your character. If thats not not enough the game also has a cash shop where you can buy many kinds of costumes  and items that give you mounts and many peices of gear that helps you make many diffrent character customizations. Another two features is pvp and the skill tree. Elsword has a solid base for pvp that allows you to create your own combinations of combos that can knock your opponent down with lightning ast attks to attking your enemy while their in the air with swift skills or slashes from the characters blade. with many skills and combinations to chose from the pvp has a uniqueness of its own. For players that want to get married in game there is a marriage system. The marriage sytem is broken into 4 steps. first you need to find the person you want your character to marry. afterwards you need to buy the couples ring from the cash shop (The item can only be found in the CashShop alone).once you give the ring to the person you want to marry you must wait 3 days (this time can be used to get to know eachother better ). when the time is up you can buy the marriage pakage which will have a certain number of invatations you can send to your friends and a item for using one of the chappels in the game. The final feature i'm going to be speaking of is the world aspect of the game since with all due respect i don't want to waste any more of peoples time.the world aspect may be that it is a side-scroller game but that doesn't mean it doesn't have anything for you to do. this multiplayer game will have you in a single player instance to start with in the beginning but there is more to it. after that one instance you are sent into the open world. you can meet many people, make friends, even for you people that struggle with the dungeons or quest there is a large community of people to help you get through the game.","July 26, 2014","true","90.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

So it's really hard to just play the game for a long time after the first   week say about 2 tops for me anyway.

Even though they have fixed a lot of the problems with the game the cons outway the pros by a land slide. PvP isnt fun whatsoever. For me I would always be put against someone 30 Levels higher than me and or someone who hasnt even played the game. Don't even get me started on the amount of spotty connections you have. This game in general just is a massive decline. Those willing to pay are given a giant advantage over people who dont pay and it just isnt fair. This is seen even in dungeon mode when people have mounts and payed for costumes and gear, they wipe through the dungeon without letting you get a single hit. Boss fights are now a thing of the past with the new mount system! There DLC is just pushing it. Im getting really out of order here but ill slow it down and focus on PVP a little more.\n\nPVP IS ABSOLUTE ♥♥♥♥\nDon't get me started on balancing. As seen by the constant "pay to win" theme of this game PVP is COMPLETELY UNBALANCED. Its not just the pay to win theme either! The Ranking, Im level 35 going against a level 60 Triple S rank. Characters are complete and utter trash Ranged Characters are unfair and just filled with spam. Some characters can even warp out of your combos after youve wasted hours just trying to get the slippery ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into the combo.\n\nPVE IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE\nITS BORING, REPATITIVE, AND JUST A WASTE OF TIME\n\nTHE VERDICT HAS BEEN IN. THIS GAME SUCKS ♥♥♥\n\n(oh btw check out\nVoidMage_Lowell's review probably right below my review.

The game mostly revolve around doing quests and leveling up, along with a few side quest for pets or material. The battling in this game is kinda boring, since the trick is to go up and attack before the enemy hits you, but they added along with it many different attack moves varying from each class. One problem is that looking good in this game is costly, since 5 dollar gets you about 600/500 credit in the game and a even a shoe cost 200 so if the developers would lower the cost a bit the game would be prefect.The game does alot of speaicl events and offers for the player, like giveaways, 2x drops, etc. In the game you are able to get marry and create guilds (with real money) and certain other things.Overall, it's a great game and I would recommend this to anybody who enjoy mmos and anime.","November 23, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'd like the start with the cons as in my opinion, the cons should come first, (I apologize if this review isn't all that great, it's my first one haha). Okay so where to begin...\nThe community is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the way I've experienced it. You either meet people who don't talk at all, or you meet people who do talk and are just down right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s(this game as I have noticed mostly consists of kids who still think the term "noob" is a legit insult). The community isn't as bad if you don't mind playing with kids who age between 13-17. Now I know there are good people on this game, older or younger. I've met tons of friends on here. Just don't get your hopes up with finding people in game to group with. Oh and the North America support for Elsword is crap compared to Korea where it originated... Just saying:P\nThe combat can be repetitive if you find doing almost the same thing all of the time repetitive. Now I say almost because, depending on your level, things can get a little spiced up. But it's a 2d sidecroller what else is there to expect right?\nThose are 2 of my biggest cons, obviously the community being the big ol ♥♥♥♥ pile at your school's bathroom it is. I hate playing with people who don't understand that (competitive or not) games are meant to be enjoyed. Lots of kids these days don't get that, and it's quite sad to be honest...\nNow for the pros:D The game is fun, for me the simplisity of the game is the star of the show. It's something to just sit back and play(if you have friends who play then that really helps). It's not a difficult game unless you want it to be, such as getting into combos, pvp, (which I forgot to mention is also ♥♥♥♥) and etc.\nThe skills and moves you learn are nice and flashy, and there are plenty of classes/characters to choose from. It's overall definetly one of the better side scroller beat em' ups I've played.\nThe verdict? This game is a good time passer and fun for simple gameplay, or another way to put it, good for casual gamers. Would I reccomend this game to others? NO because I have tried in the past and no one I have reccomended it to liked this game haha. Would I reccomend it to myself? YES... I know that's a weird way of putting it but yeah...\nAnywaysm I thank anyone who read through this review and hope it helps.","September 18, 2014","false","399.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

FREEMIUM and PAY-TO-WIN at its finest. Most free MMOs have paid "cash" items that give cosmetic changes and are made to look cool, but this games cash items actually give stat bonuses, if they work in PvP or not I don't care its still BULL. This game is so bugged out its not even funny: its a combo based game and the enemies will LITERALLY TELEPORT BEHIND YOU breaking your combo, when an enemy teleports behind you another enemy will come up behind you and trap you and combo you to death, the enemies are solid objects so you can't walk by them and you will be knocked down back in between them if you try to jump out from between them which on most maps is a must if you can't stagger or knock back the enemies which enemies won't be, the quest system is buggy and event quests DON'T work properly, the options don't work properly. Now done with the bugs my problems with the game: defaults to windowed mode and the full screen option doesn't work unless it is restarted (which granted is usual for SOME games), its a combo based game, moving from map to map takes forever and is slow, the map is 2D and 3D moving between this is a pain in the rear, its pay-to-win, you can only equip 4 skills if you want more you have to PAY for it, item inventory is tiny to expand it you PAY for it, for the size of the inventory to many items drop basically forcing you to either sell your entire inventory or PAY to have it expanded, the tutorial sucks and doesn't tell anything about the game, the key binds are not obvious and make no sense, the game does an absolute horrible job at showing how much health you have, *the potions are useless and heal nothing its easier to die and respawn right where you died with no penalty or reprocussion because you come back with full health and mana, the UI is not user or beginner friendly at all and the tutorial doesn't help you basically need to come out of the womb knowing how to play this game or look up how to play if you're a beginner, there is a constant tutorial that flashes over your skill set and gets annoying after playing for 4 hours telling me to hit left CTL for a skill that does really nothing, my first time playing it froze the minute I got to the starting town cause my friend sent me a party and friend invite then it froze again randomly in the middle of playing but this time it came back. I love MMORPGs but this is the WORST I have played, absolute garbage and horse dung. probably will NEVER PLAY AGAIN. Only reason why I played is because me and my friend made a deal to play each others MMOs with each other for a week. In short: God this was utter trash and a NIGHTMARE to play I never want to play again nor probably never will.\n*I was playing Add which is supposidly a "mage class" apparently this mage has more health than normal mages in otther MMOs because i used a potion that healed 4500hp and barely healed a 5th of my hp and this game DOESN'T show your max HP so its hard to tell how much you have so you just need to guess how much HP you have, and the potions are on a 60 second cool down. 60 SECONDS even if you have 3 DIFFERENT potions on your quick slots they ALL go on cooldown, if the potions REGENED health it would be a different story or if there is no cooldown for the others it would be fine.","July 26, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Multiplayer in this game is great, and it's something I can see nothing wrong with it.\n\nThe game has a large cast of characters (soon to be 10), so you can always go back and try that one out, each with their own job paths, which add to the possibilites.\n\nSo, this game might not be your cup of tea, but personally, this game is entertained me for years, and continues to even today.","December 11, 2014","true","257.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The boost from +9  to +10 is just too significant.\n\nLag, oh lord, save me here. This game is infested with it and it means so much while in PvP, does not matter how fast or good you are, you lag or the enemy lag, it turns the table way to significantly, this will not be fixed because of how the game is developed (Peer to peer)\n\nFor an old game it is odd how high the prices are in the cash shop.\n\nElsword is pretty much the Perfect World of action/2D genre, that pretty much sums it up.","July 7, 2015","false","337.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

But then I discovered Void Elsword. If you're like me... Go over to Void Elsword, KR Exp table, cheaper prices on literally everything including Void's version of K-Ching. Also unlimited stamina, all you gotta do is buy the potions which are only 1k each. I know I don't have many hours on steam Elsword, that's because I played Elsword before I got a steam account. I should have about 200 hours on it tho. I just liked remaking characters and then stopping at 40. In Void I can get to 70 no problem, and in my opinion, Void is much more enjoyable due to fact that the community is so much nicer and literally almost everyone gets along. BEWARE PVP!

But, I have had an enourmous ammount of fun with this game. I would recommend if you want to play for a little bit, and not grind seriously. If you like side scrolling beat-em-ups, and anime, then this game is for you. If not, then stay away. You will only enjoy events that have new releases or revamps, and the game may seem fun at first, but the novelty wears off. The economy sucks too. Like, you can't buy anything really. I have no REAL quarrel with the game, it's just that sometimes the developers don't seem to care (KoG) about the NA servers. IF you can, I would recommend the Korean servers.

OVERPRICED..... for starters the costumes (which for some reason cost around $20-25 for a full set) provide minor buffs to your stats.. now end game this stuff becomes a pretty large help.. then lets talk about accessories they also provide buffs (however these are just as expensive if not more then the actual outfit overall were talking a good.. ehhhh $50-60 to outfit your character properly mind you that isnt even including things like mounts which range up to like $40-50 depending on your mount some are low in the $20s also isnt including the fact they cut all your storages in half and if you want the other portion you have to pay along with your item bar is cut in half too so that you have to pay for and the list goes on) and then theres the 2nd skill bar which costs $10 per character.. overall the game is a very large cash grab and while playable players who can throw money at there screen can definitly have a much more enjoyable, faster, and stronger experience plus they just look better.. now you think well thats fine one character only $80 thats fine i can do that.. keep in mind though thats PER CHARACTER and theres alot of classes PER CHARACTER your going to be tempted into other classes which is just going to slowly rack up that amount of money you spend. The community is chock-full of ages that are usually between 8-14 (thats a average not everybody) in which can get on your nerves severely when they start whining at you especially when it comes to things like pvp.. now onto the game mechanics.. while the game is indeed a cash grab from hell and full of squeakers the gameplay is actually pretty superb for this kind of gamestyle depending on your character and class will depend on a lot of combos you can learn and then execute in pvp sounds great right? it is great however this game suffers from time to time LAG when it comes to pvp even with the most godly of connections the servers can suddenly start going unstable (for unknown reasons probably from just sheer amount of players at one time or DDOS whatever the case may be lag is lag and can completely alter a match or even knock you out of a ranked game which yes WILL penalize you but not by much because the ranked system caters to the player making it very easy to keep rank less you are a SSS in which things are more complicated.. the higher the rank you go the more TOXIC the community actually becomes and alot of times just during your PVE runs you will get people who appear afk but infact are just standing around making YOU do the work and when the next area is ready that player will then move to make you go forward.. the only actual good quality to this game is indeed the combat but with the pay to win scale the random lag and toxic squeakers i cant actually recommend this game the game is enjoyable but you will indeed notice alot of things concerning pay to win that makes things alot less enjoyable for you...","July 3, 2015","false","72.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Biggest problem for me is the fact that if you want to win in this game, you need to donate, the game is fun casual play, but as for wanting to get better, its all in how much you pay to win, skill only takes you so far in it. The community itself has gone very downhil since the game started as well, now its full of trolls and people with giant egos thanks to how much they've spent on it. Reason why I make I recommend it is if you can look past the pvp and dungeon things, it has some nice events to help you reach max level, some challenging dungeons and you dont /need/ to party with strangers. Its great to play with friends, as for trying to playing play it competitively, unless you're willing to spend a ton of cash, I wouldn't recommend it.","February 21, 2015","true","20.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also unlimited stamina, all you gotta do is buy the potions which are only 1k each. I know I don't have many hours on steam Elsword, that's because I played Elsword before I got a steam account. I should have about 200 hours on it tho. I just liked remaking characters and then stopping at 40. In Void I can get to 70 no problem, and in my opinion, Void is much more enjoyable due to fact that the community is so much nicer and literally almost everyone gets along. BEWARE PVP!

Although you start out as a select character with no real customization you can later find customization through your armor choices, your class choices and if you wish to through the store that has items you have to pay for. The fast paced game style allows for a quick and fairly painless leveling experience that gets you into the end game raids that much faster.  Elsword starts you off with a select amount of classes, that in themselves have their own sub-classes. Elsword also allows for a sub-class switch if you decide being on the dark side isn't your thing. The community although has its own few trollers and haters, is generally really nice, from Jokes being told into the world chat to guilds offering help and invites all day long. Elsword does support the gaming controller although I wouldn't recommend it with the amount of button smashing you'll be doing to get those perfect combo's.","March 27, 2015","true","47.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For a free to play i highly recommend this game. Unlike the more popular games like WoW, this actually takes skills to play instead of standing around click on skills. You actually have to move and do combos. I will say that the item mall is a little overpriced with the pretty sets you can get from ice burners being expensive, like 40 dollars for a whole set depending on what you are getting. Also the ice burners chance of actually getting something worth while is very low. I think out of 20 burners i used through the entire game i got one good costume piece. The PvP is a bit iffy, i find that a lot of people i go against arent really all that good at Pvp, they just spam the same move over and over and over to do combos which is a bit boring. People also have crappy internet who PvP so they get an advantage by lagging and not be affected by combos and getting away from attacks.\nBut still i recommend you play this game if you like a challenge.","June 3, 2015","true","319.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShonowTH/recommended/237310/","ShonowTH","Taco Belle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShonowTH/","84 products in account","Elsword is grand, mostly.\n\nLike any community, you'll frequently run into people who are offended by trivial things, and make trivial of heavy things. That aside..\n\nIn regard to gameplay alone, it's quite fun. Not entirely original, though the combination of artwork and partially-original sounds were something I dreamed of making back when I was in my early teen years (the art format, I mean. The way it's drawn seems simple, but it's complex. Not really cartoony, just.. you know).\n\nThe themes in it, other than that of Raven's life, are very well-pieced together. Some ideas are redundant to an extent, but not cliche (other than Raven). Each character features 3 job changes, and a job advancement for each job. You can switch jobs if you like, but that costs at least $19.. definitely not worth it.\n\nLike any online community that has money, inflation happens all the time, even on the most trivial and useless junk. Just saying. Players and their self-servitude cause problems for everyone, not caring, and then cause this same grief for others.\n\nAs far as gameplay, directly.. well, it'sa classic scenario of "fun and basic." The graphics are nice, and I particularly enjoy the black outline, despite the 3D perspectives. I would really like to see this game in a format other than side-scrolling, but I don't suppose that'll happen anytime soon. Maybe.\n\nIf there's one thing I would do to change the game, it would definitely be that I'd remove Raven from it. As you'd expect, Raven is mostly played by guys who want to look cool or aggressive or powerful or skilled.. or by fangirls who want nothing less than to satisfy their insatiable eyes. Please keep in mind that I said "mostly."\n\nRaven, for those who don't know, is the unbearably redundant character who's tall, dark, strong, self-concerned, and has a freakishly annoying voice, especially in combat (with yells that don't seem satiable with how many people they can annoy). Somehow, annoying + cliche + arrogant = popular. Raven is easily one of the most-used characters in PVP, which isn't surprising. Anyone who wants to play this game, I'm not stopping you, but PVP is the worst thing in Elsword (excluding the horrible things people have the gall to say or do). Well, I don't have much quarrel with the idea of PVP, but between the fairness-obliterating connection issues people often come across and the fools who find themselves skilled when they attack and "defeat" someone who's talking or whatnot (then having the lack of sense or dignity to even say it's their own fault for not defending themselves), PVP is not worth the time or effort. Once in every several days, you'll meet an honorable opponent, but by the time you figure that out, you'll have lost any will to play against that person.\nWhat I was getting at earlier, though, those extremely rude and arrogant players who have no dignity are almost always a Raven, Rena, Chung, or Elsword. Most often, Raven and Chung.\n\nElsword is my favorite character. Particularly Sheath Knight. If Infinity Sword looked as cool as Sheath Knight, that would be my favorite, instead. Sheath Knight looks like some radical, skilled speedster who has lots of dignity. Infinity Sword looks like someone who got drunk and has his hair styled to look as stupid as could possibly be comprehended while wearing spandex and high heels. I have yet to find a detail about Infinity Sword, regarding appearance, that I like.","September 27, 2013","true","961.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaqbeatgoku/recommended/237310/","shaqbeatgoku","GALO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shaqbeatgoku/","69 products in account","So I think I've wasted enough precious hours to this game to state some glaring problems with it. It's more hours than what Steam says, I started before the Steam greenlight if memory serves.\n\n1. Free 2 play, pay 2 win system. The entire cash shop is a joke.\n2. PvP is broken, especially with new classes and it's full of cheap hoes spamming autotracking skills and the sort\n3. My experience with the community is generally terribad with trolls leaving mid-match and such\n4. Absolutely atrocious drop rates of items. I don't know if I was just that unlucky, but I had to constantly redo dungeons for the job advance quests, which consist of annoying, repetitive chores like defeat this boss X times and get Y items. The worst is the combination of those two - get Z of boss drops. So if the random number generator didn't agree with me (which happened a lot), I had do the dungeon all over again. It's all horrible luck based bull that wastes hours of time and stamina, which brings me to the next issue.\n5. The asinine stamina system. Run out of stamina, can't play any more dungons for the day. Just, why? I decide when to stop playing, not the game.\n6. KOG's definition of "balance" may greatly differ from yours. Or they may not care at all. Which seems to be the case since these new characters recently are all about "Let's make this class more epic than the last" and end up utterly breaking the gameplay as a result of these obnoxious wanks showing off. Which brings me to the next issue.\n7. Add. Refer to #2. Haven't touched this game in ages, but I know that adding (no pun intended) one more blatantly overpowered (from what I've seen and heard about him) character isn't a good thing. I don't plan to play this game again just to find out how criminally unbalanced he is.\n8. Grinding for levels, job advancement, farming for items, pretty much the entire PvE gameplay in general gets stale, boring and repetitive after a while, especially with the stamina system and hyper OP guys running around flexing their PAY2WIN benefits killing any potential enjoyment. Dungeons are as linear as linear can be.\n9. Weeaboo simulator\n\nHonestly, I can't say that I didn't have some fun with this game. This is a Korean MMO, and Korean MMOs love hyper, epic and flashy combos that with fast paced action can give your eyes quite the colorful seizure. The skills look cool when you're running around beating up stuff and it's mildly exciting with a full party, especially when you're ganging up on bosses whacking the ever living daylights out of them. The game has its moments. It just gets old and routine pretty quickly, especially at higher levels where leveling and quests becomes a little more than a drawn out chore that gets increasingly stretched out by the dumb stamina system. Check it out if you don't mind these issues and the microtransaction advantages, but I personally would just invest my time in a good game.\n\nIf you like the game, you may want to consider Void Elsword. It's a private server without the BS of NA from what I've heard.","March 24, 2015","false","6.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game mostly revolve around doing quests and leveling up, along with a few side quest for pets or material. The battling in this game is kinda boring, since the trick is to go up and attack before the enemy hits you, but they added along with it many different attack moves varying from each class. One problem is that looking good in this game is costly, since 5 dollar gets you about 600/500 credit in the game and a even a shoe cost 200 so if the developers would lower the cost a bit the game would be prefect.The game does alot of speaicl events and offers for the player, like giveaways, 2x drops, etc. In the game you are able to get marry and create guilds (with real money) and certain other things.Overall, it's a great game and I would recommend this to anybody who enjoy mmos and anime.","November 23, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is absolutely horrendous.\nI'm not even talking about the PAY TO WIN part or the part that PVP is unbalanced, or that a good 50% of your inventory is unusable without buying expansions for it, or that your bank only has 8 slots for free to play players.\nThe community has no respect for one another and even refuses to.\n\nBeyond all of that, the video they have for advertising on steam straight up lies to you over and over again!\nNUMBER 1.Fast paced dungeons? Only if you're playing with max level players who make the game unenjoyable, otherwise I'd rather take a nap then play a PVE stage.\nNUMBER 2. Co-Op Gameplay? If you aren't playing with friends you're playing with silent vindictive haters that will chew you out for even the slightest mistake.\nNUMBER 3. 'Epic Bosses'? The bosses in this game are a joke and even a full co-op group of 6 year old friends could beat these bosses no matter how big they are.\nNUMBER 4. Massive fields.. Absolutely not. Your character is painfully slow and can make it across a field's map in under a minute. Not small, the enemies on these fields are just recycled versions of the dungeon variants.\nNUMBER 5. Costumes, You can't do this unless you want to traverse the "Free to play" line or want to put in the effort of making yourself undoubtedly miserable just to get enough ED to afford a costume piece.\nNUMBER 6. PVP is absolutely not enjoyable and they are showcasing PVP as a good point? This is the worst part about this game. Anything past this point is already explained.\n\nAfter their showcase video deceiving you about every selling point, you might unfortunately get deceived by the self-serving community and end up wronging you. So you go submit a ticket about it. I have run into customer support representatives that tell me to do their investigation for them (which should not be named). I had to specifically request the individual representative to stop replying to my tickets since they were of no help. The only help I have ever received from their support was One representative getting the previously stated above one from contacting me again.\n\nI would never reccomend this game to anyone.\nIf you feel pushed to play this terrible game, never spend money on it;  you will instantly regret it.\nAlso a final note this game will continue getting worse, until it is no longer in existance; I guarantee you this.","June 1, 2015","false","431.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Even though they have fixed a lot of the problems with the game the cons outway the pros by a land slide. PvP isnt fun whatsoever. For me I would always be put against someone 30 Levels higher than me and or someone who hasnt even played the game. Don't even get me started on the amount of spotty connections you have. This game in general just is a massive decline. Those willing to pay are given a giant advantage over people who dont pay and it just isnt fair. This is seen even in dungeon mode when people have mounts and payed for costumes and gear, they wipe through the dungeon without letting you get a single hit. Boss fights are now a thing of the past with the new mount system! There DLC is just pushing it. Im getting really out of order here but ill slow it down and focus on PVP a little more.\n\nPVP IS ABSOLUTE ♥♥♥♥\nDon't get me started on balancing. As seen by the constant "pay to win" theme of this game PVP is COMPLETELY UNBALANCED. Its not just the pay to win theme either! The Ranking, Im level 35 going against a level 60 Triple S rank. Characters are complete and utter trash Ranged Characters are unfair and just filled with spam. Some characters can even warp out of your combos after youve wasted hours just trying to get the slippery ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into the combo.\n\nPVE IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE\nITS BORING, REPATITIVE, AND JUST A WASTE OF TIME\n\nTHE VERDICT HAS BEEN IN.

I'd like the start with the cons as in my opinion, the cons should come first, (I apologize if this review isn't all that great, it's my first one haha). Okay so where to begin...\nThe community is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the way I've experienced it. You either meet people who don't talk at all, or you meet people who do talk and are just down right ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s(this game as I have noticed mostly consists of kids who still think the term "noob" is a legit insult). The community isn't as bad if you don't mind playing with kids who age between 13-17. Now I know there are good people on this game, older or younger. I've met tons of friends on here. Just don't get your hopes up with finding people in game to group with. Oh and the North America support for Elsword is crap compared to Korea where it originated... Just saying:P\nThe combat can be repetitive if you find doing almost the same thing all of the time repetitive. Now I say almost because, depending on your level, things can get a little spiced up. But it's a 2d sidecroller what else is there to expect right?\nThose are 2 of my biggest cons, obviously the community being the big ol ♥♥♥♥ pile at your school's bathroom it is. I hate playing with people who don't understand that (competitive or not) games are meant to be enjoyed. Lots of kids these days don't get that, and it's quite sad to be honest...\nNow for the pros:D The game is fun, for me the simplisity of the game is the star of the show. It's something to just sit back and play(if you have friends who play then that really helps). It's not a difficult game unless you want it to be, such as getting into combos, pvp, (which I forgot to mention is also ♥♥♥♥) and etc.\nThe skills and moves you learn are nice and flashy, and there are plenty of classes/characters to choose from. It's overall definetly one of the better side scroller beat em' ups I've played.\nThe verdict? This game is a good time passer and fun for simple gameplay, or another way to put it, good for casual gamers. Would I reccomend this game to others? NO because I have tried in the past and no one I have reccomended it to liked this game haha. Would I reccomend it to myself? YES... I know that's a weird way of putting it but yeah...\nAnywaysm I thank anyone who read through this review and hope it helps.","September 18, 2014","false","399.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

I always like these type of games, since it has that manga/anime feel to it. Their is about 6 characters at the moment, (8/29/15) and I have a lot of stuff to talk about this game, so let's get started! The story seems to be leading a good way of what is happening, there's always a good amount of sub-quests/story quests to enjoy.\n\nThe one thing I loved is that, different character have a unique skill,style,class path, ect. The voice acting is pretty nice, I don't mind too much from it since it is voiced in Japanese. The Stage/environment is a 8.7/10 since it's not really perfect in my opinion, but it's nice. There are some "Main Story Quest" that have a cinematic cutscene after you completed it. Very nice to the story overall.\n\nDifferent Gameplay Mechanics,Items,Equipment,Features and other great things that make this game alive, but then there is one problem to "Elsword". The PvP matchup seems to be alright, but bad at the same time, because due to having to vs lvl 70's that will 1 shot you, but most of my time on PvP, it's doesn't occur too much then it use to.\n\nI know people been saying this is a "Pay2Win" type of game, it's been one of those typical games, but keep it clean and have fun with your friends (if your friends play it).\n\nOverall, I must rate this game a total of 9/10, remember everyone will have their own opinion.\n\nHave a wonderful day!!  \>.< /\n\n[Elsword Main Page]\nhttp://en.elswordonline.com/\n\n[Elsword Wiki Page]\nhttp://elwiki.net/w/Main_Page","August 29, 2015","true","330.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That however should be no reason to not try this game. Besides being repetative Elsword has plenty of features in game to make the game more fun and also entertaining. One Feature is character customization. The game has many In-Game shops where you can buy accessories and diffrent types of armor for your character. If thats not not enough the game also has a cash shop where you can buy many kinds of costumes  and items that give you mounts and many peices of gear that helps you make many diffrent character customizations. Another two features is pvp and the skill tree. Elsword has a solid base for pvp that allows you to create your own combinations of combos that can knock your opponent down with lightning ast attks to attking your enemy while their in the air with swift skills or slashes from the characters blade. with many skills and combinations to chose from the pvp has a uniqueness of its own. For players that want to get married in game there is a marriage system. The marriage sytem is broken into 4 steps. first you need to find the person you want your character to marry. afterwards you need to buy the couples ring from the cash shop (The item can only be found in the CashShop alone).once you give the ring to the person you want to marry you must wait 3 days (this time can be used to get to know eachother better ). when the time is up you can buy the marriage pakage which will have a certain number of invatations you can send to your friends and a item for using one of the chappels in the game. The final feature i'm going to be speaking of is the world aspect of the game since with all due respect i don't want to waste any more of peoples time.the world aspect may be that it is a side-scroller game but that doesn't mean it doesn't have anything for you to do. this multiplayer game will have you in a single player instance to start with in the beginning but there is more to it. after that one instance you are sent into the open world. you can meet many people, make friends, even for you people that struggle with the dungeons or quest there is a large community of people to help you get through the game.","July 26, 2014","true","90.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

FREEMIUM and PAY-TO-WIN at its finest. Most free MMOs have paid "cash" items that give cosmetic changes and are made to look cool, but this games cash items actually give stat bonuses, if they work in PvP or not I don't care its still BULL. This game is so bugged out its not even funny: its a combo based game and the enemies will LITERALLY TELEPORT BEHIND YOU breaking your combo, when an enemy teleports behind you another enemy will come up behind you and trap you and combo you to death, the enemies are solid objects so you can't walk by them and you will be knocked down back in between them if you try to jump out from between them which on most maps is a must if you can't stagger or knock back the enemies which enemies won't be, the quest system is buggy and event quests DON'T work properly, the options don't work properly. Now done with the bugs my problems with the game: defaults to windowed mode and the full screen option doesn't work unless it is restarted (which granted is usual for SOME games), its a combo based game, moving from map to map takes forever and is slow, the map is 2D and 3D moving between this is a pain in the rear, its pay-to-win, you can only equip 4 skills if you want more you have to PAY for it, item inventory is tiny to expand it you PAY for it, for the size of the inventory to many items drop basically forcing you to either sell your entire inventory or PAY to have it expanded, the tutorial sucks and doesn't tell anything about the game, the key binds are not obvious and make no sense, the game does an absolute horrible job at showing how much health you have, *the potions are useless and heal nothing its easier to die and respawn right where you died with no penalty or reprocussion because you come back with full health and mana, the UI is not user or beginner friendly at all and the tutorial doesn't help you basically need to come out of the womb knowing how to play this game or look up how to play if you're a beginner, there is a constant tutorial that flashes over your skill set and gets annoying after playing for 4 hours telling me to hit left CTL for a skill that does really nothing, my first time playing it froze the minute I got to the starting town cause my friend sent me a party and friend invite then it froze again randomly in the middle of playing but this time it came back. I love MMORPGs but this is the WORST I have played, absolute garbage and horse dung. probably will NEVER PLAY AGAIN. Only reason why I played is because me and my friend made a deal to play each others MMOs with each other for a week. In short: God this was utter trash and a NIGHTMARE to play I never want to play again nor probably never will.\n*I was playing Add which is supposidly a "mage class" apparently this mage has more health than normal mages in otther MMOs because i used a potion that healed 4500hp and barely healed a 5th of my hp and this game DOESN'T show your max HP so its hard to tell how much you have so you just need to guess how much HP you have, and the potions are on a 60 second cool down. 60 SECONDS even if you have 3 DIFFERENT potions on your quick slots they ALL go on cooldown, if the potions REGENED health it would be a different story or if there is no cooldown for the others it would be fine.","July 26, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Elsword is a good game, it has a good concept of ARPG. About balancing, nerfs and buffs come later to NA but that doesn't mean you won't be able to win a PvP, all classes have a general balance. It has a nice cashshop, and that doesn't mean It's P2W, it's completely F2P, you can have a nice gaming experience with Elsword without spending a penny. It has an incredible array of character customization. This game brings fresh air, it has a good combo system which allows you to do cool combos. For that RPG lovers, it has a interesting backstory.

Starting off with the good the classes are really cool and all are equally as awsome as the next. Each with a cute backstory i can't find anything wrong with them.  The story is good and the cut scenes are pieces of art. They also come out with new character relitivly quickly for most MMOs. Which means theres always something new to try. But even with all that said this is just another pay to win game.. If you want anything good thats PERMINANT you have to pay for it out of your own wallet.

I always like these type of games, since it has that manga/anime feel to it. Their is about 6 characters at the moment, (8/29/15) and I have a lot of stuff to talk about this game, so let's get started! The story seems to be leading a good way of what is happening, there's always a good amount of sub-quests/story quests to enjoy.\n\nThe one thing I loved is that, different character have a unique skill,style,class path, ect. The voice acting is pretty nice, I don't mind too much from it since it is voiced in Japanese. The Stage/environment is a 8.7/10 since it's not really perfect in my opinion, but it's nice. There are some "Main Story Quest" that have a cinematic cutscene after you completed it. Very nice to the story overall.\n\nDifferent Gameplay Mechanics,Items,Equipment,Features and other great things that make this game alive, but then there is one problem to "Elsword". The PvP matchup seems to be alright, but bad at the same time, because due to having to vs lvl 70's that will 1 shot you, but most of my time on PvP, it's doesn't occur too much then it use to.\n\nI know people been saying this is a "Pay2Win" type of game, it's been one of those typical games, but keep it clean and have fun with your friends (if your friends play it).\n\nOverall, I must rate this game a total of 9/10, remember everyone will have their own opinion.\n\nHave a wonderful day!!  \>.< /\n\n[Elsword Main Page]\nhttp://en.elswordonline.com/\n\n[Elsword Wiki Page]\nhttp://elwiki.net/w/Main_Page","August 29, 2015","true","330.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The voices are in japanese which is fine and a really easy style of combat to use. You have a variety of characters to choose from and each comes with their own abilities and difficulty style. The game is really fun to play and can immerse you for many hours while you level up, select your skills and make them more powerful using skill points. The game does have an item mall where you can spend real money converted into K-Ching to get special items, class upgrades, costumes with stats that increase as you level up. The down side to the item mall is that you have to choose if you want the items you purchase from there to be permanent or temporary (idk why you want a trial run of the item but I know some people do for some reason. My opinion is get the items you want as a permanent keeper). The story is quite good and entertaining with cutscene's and intro that actually shows you how to start off. Anyone wanting to play a side scrolling rpg this is the game for you. I hope you enjoy playing the game or will join the game and start your own adventure.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShonowTH/recommended/237310/","ShonowTH","Taco Belle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShonowTH/","84 products in account","Elsword is grand, mostly.\n\nLike any community, you'll frequently run into people who are offended by trivial things, and make trivial of heavy things. That aside..\n\nIn regard to gameplay alone, it's quite fun. Not entirely original, though the combination of artwork and partially-original sounds were something I dreamed of making back when I was in my early teen years (the art format, I mean. The way it's drawn seems simple, but it's complex. Not really cartoony, just.. you know).\n\nThe themes in it, other than that of Raven's life, are very well-pieced together. Some ideas are redundant to an extent, but not cliche (other than Raven). Each character features 3 job changes, and a job advancement for each job. You can switch jobs if you like, but that costs at least $19.. definitely not worth it.\n\nLike any online community that has money, inflation happens all the time, even on the most trivial and useless junk. Just saying. Players and their self-servitude cause problems for everyone, not caring, and then cause this same grief for others.\n\nAs far as gameplay, directly.. well, it'sa classic scenario of "fun and basic." The graphics are nice, and I particularly enjoy the black outline, despite the 3D perspectives. I would really like to see this game in a format other than side-scrolling, but I don't suppose that'll happen anytime soon. Maybe.\n\nIf there's one thing I would do to change the game, it would definitely be that I'd remove Raven from it. As you'd expect, Raven is mostly played by guys who want to look cool or aggressive or powerful or skilled.. or by fangirls who want nothing less than to satisfy their insatiable eyes. Please keep in mind that I said "mostly."\n\nRaven, for those who don't know, is the unbearably redundant character who's tall, dark, strong, self-concerned, and has a freakishly annoying voice, especially in combat (with yells that don't seem satiable with how many people they can annoy). Somehow, annoying + cliche + arrogant = popular. Raven is easily one of the most-used characters in PVP, which isn't surprising. Anyone who wants to play this game, I'm not stopping you, but PVP is the worst thing in Elsword (excluding the horrible things people have the gall to say or do). Well, I don't have much quarrel with the idea of PVP, but between the fairness-obliterating connection issues people often come across and the fools who find themselves skilled when they attack and "defeat" someone who's talking or whatnot (then having the lack of sense or dignity to even say it's their own fault for not defending themselves), PVP is not worth the time or effort. Once in every several days, you'll meet an honorable opponent, but by the time you figure that out, you'll have lost any will to play against that person.\nWhat I was getting at earlier, though, those extremely rude and arrogant players who have no dignity are almost always a Raven, Rena, Chung, or Elsword. Most often, Raven and Chung.\n\nElsword is my favorite character. Particularly Sheath Knight. If Infinity Sword looked as cool as Sheath Knight, that would be my favorite, instead. Sheath Knight looks like some radical, skilled speedster who has lots of dignity. Infinity Sword looks like someone who got drunk and has his hair styled to look as stupid as could possibly be comprehended while wearing spandex and high heels. I have yet to find a detail about Infinity Sword, regarding appearance, that I like.","September 27, 2013","true","961.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","6"

There is NOTHING in this game that you HAVE to buy. There are convenience items and nothing actually gives you an advantage over other players. I've been playing this game since back when there were only 4 classes, and it has evolved and plays beautifully. The items that you can buy on the shop are cosmetic and quality of life to put it simply, there are costumes, which granted are expensive, but you don't need them at all, they give very minor stats to your character and some of the late game armor that you can easily obtain looks better anyway. There are also pets and mounts which are just quality of life items that give you an easier and lazier PVE experience. The only thing that I can say is a usual must pay is the second B slot, which shouldn't be a paid thing, but if you're going to enjoy and play the game a lot, then what's $8 other than that you don't have to buy anything, I've NEVER expanded my inventory or bank space and I get by just fine and happy. Now to the gameplay, it's an extremely unique mmorpg that combines 2D Side Scrolling with 3D elements, it has a unique combo system between it's attack buttons and skills, and each character feels unique and able to customize to your play style. Each character currently in the game has 3 jobs to choose from, each of which greatly alters your characters' play style. All and all the games PVE is superb and I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and well put together mmo. Now for the PVP, it's a very fun experience whether you're casual or hardcore going into it, it's very skill based and requires you to have a deep understanding of your character and the character your going against. It comes in the form of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and a base race game mode. Where it falls short sometimes is it's balance, playing some characters against others can be overwhelming for one side and frustrating at times, but it's nothing that practice and effort can't solve. The biggest issue that i've had with this game is latency, there will be random moments in PVE where i'll be attacking a monster and it will not register any damage for several seconds and this same deal can happen in PVP along with an enemy lag teleporting around, but it all usually sorts itself out. Overall I believe that this is a great MMO that has grown beautifully and has the potential to stay amazing for years to come and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for something new.","June 10, 2015","true","444.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","2"

No peripheral vision for these things whatsoever.\n\nCostumes and extra skill slots and maybe even some extra mana or anything for in-game benefit are all purchased at someone's own conscious decision, and to everyone bashing the game just because they can't get those things, you don't need them. KoG isn't innocent in this either, they're making all kinds of appealing cash items available to us, especially costumes and summons, but all of this is optional, and it does not make or break gameplay. The game itself is not "pay-to-win" at all, and while in PvP, rings and such give an advantage, but it's mostly skill that people develop as they play.\n\nDungeon play is great with multiple players, and four skills usually do one enough, and people complaining about the B slot just want to have more skills to use, (when there are plenty of bread-and-butter combos and skills to use) and as I said earlier, events exist for just that. The past few events had quests that earned you a 15-day slot B medal, and it's hard to keep throwing jabs at the game after you realize how generous they're being.\n\nThis is a very well developed game and it has a good team working on it still. They constantly put out new events and updates that keep the game fresh, and it makes for a broad range of things to do when you get tired of doing one thing. Basically, unless you play for 12 hours a day to grind experience points, the game will always be very fun every time you play.","June 19, 2015","true","841.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

I have purchased some items but I just started and haven't had many "unfair" issues yet. It took a while to catch on to the way you play in PvP, but after I got it down it's pretty simple.\n\nThis game is so cute! I love the graphics and all the cute outfits and mounts you can aquire. There are rewards for saving special currency so you have the option to collect them or do extra quests to get better and cuter items!\n\nI plan on putting more time into this game, for sure!

Although you start out as a select character with no real customization you can later find customization through your armor choices, your class choices and if you wish to through the store that has items you have to pay for. The fast paced game style allows for a quick and fairly painless leveling experience that gets you into the end game raids that much faster.  Elsword starts you off with a select amount of classes, that in themselves have their own sub-classes. Elsword also allows for a sub-class switch if you decide being on the dark side isn't your thing. The community although has its own few trollers and haters, is generally really nice, from Jokes being told into the world chat to guilds offering help and invites all day long. Elsword does support the gaming controller although I wouldn't recommend it with the amount of button smashing you'll be doing to get those perfect combo's.","March 27, 2015","true","47.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For a free to play i highly recommend this game. Unlike the more popular games like WoW, this actually takes skills to play instead of standing around click on skills. You actually have to move and do combos. I will say that the item mall is a little overpriced with the pretty sets you can get from ice burners being expensive, like 40 dollars for a whole set depending on what you are getting. Also the ice burners chance of actually getting something worth while is very low. I think out of 20 burners i used through the entire game i got one good costume piece. The PvP is a bit iffy, i find that a lot of people i go against arent really all that good at Pvp, they just spam the same move over and over and over to do combos which is a bit boring. People also have crappy internet who PvP so they get an advantage by lagging and not be affected by combos and getting away from attacks.\nBut still i recommend you play this game if you like a challenge.","June 3, 2015","true","319.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For a dynamic and enggaging combt system, a less-than-toxic community, and an overall good time, I recommend this game.\n\nIf you're like me, and you enjoy an mmo experience but hate repetitive combat with no real fun or purpose, then you should give this game a try. There is a huge amount of fun to be had in this game! Many MMO traditions are thrown out in favor of creating engaging, dynamic combat.\nFor starters, Elsword takes an entirely different approach to how it is played by using a Side-scrolling Beat-'Em-Up format. By removing the average open world gameplay, and instead using this format, the game has an easy time creating a fun combat system. If one wanted to, they could forget all about the MMO aspect of the game, as it is never overbearing about player interaction, and is more about combat and leveling up.\nSpeaking of leveling, the playable characters in this game are done pretty well. Like some other MMOs, this game lacks a true character creation menu, and instead provides several premade characters with their own moves, special attacks, and fleshed-out stories. While this may sound restricting, this was never a problem for me. All of the chracters look really    cool, and each character brings an entirely new playstyle to the table.\nPlus, there is a chracter progression system, in which you are able to access new special attacks and combos at certain levels. At level 15, you are able to choose a new class for your character. The class you choose can drastically change how you play, and leads into another class progression later on. A lot of the draw for playing new characters comes from this system. I spent hours just figuring out which character to play, and how they'd help my friends in combat.\nThis is, however, an MMO, so how are the other players? Well... I never really noticed them. No one ever bothered me, which is nice. You will likely only encounter other active players in the bigger towns, and occasionally in the battlefield. You can choose whether to involve yourself in that sort of thing; I personally chose to stick with my current friends. I'll say this: The community for this game is unobtrusive, and will not bother you unless you choose to be a part of it.\nOverall, I enjoy this game thoroughly.

PvP is the main shine of this game and at the moment it is extememly bad, Hit detection is terrible, 13 year olds saying one of these terms "Lagger, u suck, God your bad, etc" Character balance is not there so most of the time in pvp around A-SS Tier you will see Adds, Ara's, Luciels, and Chungs 70% of the time. PvE is fun but the best PvE feature in this game is Henir's which is basically how fast can you defeat all the bosses (Only do this when your Max Level and have the appropriate gear). People also say this game is P2W and i have to kinda disagree, In PvP i have seen people with 1 skill slot and still wreck but if you wanna be viable in PvP you kinda need to buy a skill slot b and to get the most boosts and stats out of your character then its best to get a costume and socket it. Elsword does have plenty of events that gives out free costumes but they are a pretty hefty grind.\nOverall if you are a PvP type of gamer then stay away from this game as it is Salty, Unbalanced, and sometimes laggy as hell. If you like PvE and PvE only Elsword is quite a fun game\nPvP Rating 4/10\nPvE Rating 7.5/10\nSince it doesn't excel in both categorys that is why i say not recommended.","July 15, 2015","false","276.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Elswords Arena is the most broken pvp in a online rpg i have ever experienced. The new character ADD can hit you once then constantly stun lock you until your hp drops or they fail the combo which is highly unlikely as it is just  a mashing of zzzz or xxxx constantly. Add is not the only op character that they have. Aisha's Elemental Master Job can literally just teleport all over the map gaining mp constantly to spam her most powerful skills where your stuck there chasing her the entire game. Eve's Battle Seraph job is just one big spam fest. Basically this games pvp lacks fairness and is generally just made up of spamming, running, and over powered characters compared to the others.

This would mean all of like 2 games ever released were pay to win, but in reality, that term just means paying for an advantage over another player. "skill" does not render the game not pay 2 win, rather it reinforces how little they understand game design and balance, and its so blindly clear they are fanboying too hard. For refence, there are tons of games that you can conquere pay 2 win elements with enough of a skill gab, notable games include combat arm, wolf team, gun the second duel, and many many others. The game is p2w, its an unarguable fact.\n\nfor reference, a non pay to win game is something like dota, hon, hots, lol (to a lesser extent due to the unlock system) and certain rpg like lotr, path of exile and many others. they offer either just exp boosts or travel boosts as a maximum advantage, which speeds up the game, but does not influence the balance of the game.","April 24","false","0.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

When I first started playing it reminded me of super smash bros, but with the mmo aspect combined with huge numbers, that feel so satisfing when you see them. It is relativly easy to lvl up, and there are many combos, and abilities you can use and get. The PvP is kinda broken at first, but when you start going up the raks it is easier to fight, and find a good match for you. This is a MMO, so you need people to beat dungeons. The dungeons are easy at first, but they get insanly harder to do,  I tried to solo the whole game, and it has been working till now, however it gets ever so harder for me because of the bosses (some of the most agravating bosses I have ever faced in mmos). But over all this game is extremely addicting, and if you are a mmo player you should definitly try this out.","September 28, 2014","true","119.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/davidhledo/recommended/237310/","davidhledo","Typical Trouble","http://steamcommunity.com/id/davidhledo/","","This game is extremely fun when you play with friends or a guild. However most people quit right away for specific reasons. One of the reasons is not liking the character/class you chose. In order to fully enjoy this game you have to find the character/characters that suits your playing style. Then decide if you want to PVP or PVE or both. At the higher levels of this game it could seem a little bit grindy since you have to repeat dungeons alot. As far as cash shop goes, it's really expensive however, through patience and participating in events you could honestly avoid spending too much money.\nThere's only one thing you have to buy if you go that route. You have to buy a B slot so you can use your other skills. Elsword is quite enjoyable but you have to give it a real try before discrediting it.\n\nNegatives are:\n\n-Half the population doesn't speak english and half the ones who do are immature kids.\n-Costumes and mounts and decent gear are extremely expensive and game is cash shop drawn, expected though.\n-Grindier at the higher levels\n-Not newbie friendly, especially when it comes to terms with skill points and stuff. Since you have to figure out your playing style and what skills you prefer. Guides are nice but everyone has a preference.\n-Events can seem a bit lame and generic at times.\n\nPositives are:\n\n-Fast paced side scrolling action. It's not a point-and-click game. It's also not too heavily gear based as it is skill based.\n-Every boss is different and unique.\n-New content continously\n-When you do find those special friends, it's totally fun running dungeons, taking screenshots for events, goofing off in the town squares, and showing off your pets and costumes and mounts!\n-Getting in-game currency isn't hard at all. El shards are always profitable as well as boss drops and your ED from dungeon runs.\n-Pvp is pretty fun with friends, solo match making is for all the try hards who have something to prove online so I would avoid that because they are usually hardcore and rage alot.\n-My favorite reason for playing Elsword is my friends, so the best idea is to find good ones!\n\nAs for typical ratings here they are!\n\n4/5 For gameplay\n4/5 For content [We usually always get new content but it takes a bit longer on NA server]\n2/5 For community [Good friends are a jewel and people always come and go]\n1/5 For affordability [Cash shop super over priced]\n5/5 For customization [Tons of different [cool, cute, and intimidating] pets and even rare ones from events. and characters are pretty unique considering they have 3 different classes which change their stance, pose, and voice not to mention costumes! Mounts were recently released so there aren't many yet!]\n2/5 For customer support\n3/5 For gamepad support [Better off using custom keys on gamepad]","November 16, 2014","true","187.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
