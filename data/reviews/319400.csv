Poohs voice is fully voice acted, as is the narrators, the rest of the cast is mute other than the odd funny noise.  Gameplay itself is pretty repetitive, but perfect for little folks who are just getting to grips with  moving a mouse around for the first time.\n\nThe game appears to be fairly short, after about an hour of the two of them taking it in turns to do pages they were on page 15 of 20 shown on the main map screen, apparently there are mini games they have unlocked but we haven't looked at those yet.  If a game was this short and I had purchased it for myself, I'd be saying ‚Äúto short‚Äù or ‚Äúbuy it on sale‚Äù however the full purchase price was worth it just for the moment when they were both excitedly sitting at my desk shouting ‚Äúit's a pooh game!‚Äù.\n\n4/5 honey pots","November 9, 2014","true","11.9"," 162 of 174 people (93%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","93","162","174","7","6"

We had prepared for such a crisis in the past and initiated plan: 'Help Out Nearly Endangered Youth' (H.O.N.E.Y) and came to the conclusion that this was a last resort and that we should look for Honey.\nDuring these preparations, we fell in a hole. We dealt with this the only way we know how; looking for honey.\nAfter averting the crisis, reward was deserved on our part, so we started to do what any normal person would do at this point and started looking for honey.\nWith everyone safe and sound, and a long day over with, that the seeking of honey would be appropriate that this time.\n\nTo conclude, this game has a thrilling but heartbreaking storyline to satisfy your honey-seeking desires.\nWaiting on a sequel or a Fifty Shades of Grey Animated Storybook.","October 11, 2014","true","1.4"," 70 of 99 people (71%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","71","70","99","43","0"

The portrayal of Pooh's addiction to honey is a perfect metaphor for the rising addiction/overdose of marijuana in teens in modern society. Seeing Pooh surrounded by empty honeypots in his room and terrorizing bees for their hard-earned nectar reminds me of my teenage days when I would roam the streets for a stray weed to smoke. Overall, I would give this game a 8/10 for graphics, 10/10 for gluttony, and 3/10 for Pooh himself (I'm not into chubby's).","January 22, 2015","true","35.8"," 45 of 65 people (69%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","69","45","65","52","1"

Think, think, think. I bought this game because I felt like hearing Winnie the Pooh's voice. And it delivered tremendously! It also delivered in a chock full of Poohey atmospheric plot goodness. The narrator was also excellent and is as addictive as listening to G-man from Half-Life.\n\nAlthough this game is most likely designed for kindergarten, prep aged kids and probably TotalBiscuit, I am most impressed with the approach of ideas to the point where I‚Äôd even tell off a few game developers that make mindless FPS mechanics to learn a thing or two about basic gameplay concepts with Winnie the Pooh.\n\nIt‚Äôs mostly a game where you have to click and find things on the screen. These things are mainly mini (memory recall) games, finding hidden honey pots and interactive hotspots to aid in the progression of the story (which cleverly sneaks in complex words). This is good, because it‚Äôs educational to the target audience.\n\nThe story is presented as a pop-up book. Where each page is a level that unfolds before your very eyes. The unfolding animation is a cool concept. I know this cause when I was a kid, I use to love pop-up books to the point where I‚Äôd even make my own. Why can‚Äôt there be anything artistically similar that drives the gameplay of an FPS game?\n\nYou can even go backwards and forwards through pages you have completed. There is also a home page which displays a map of your entire journey. I like this very much! It‚Äôs not stated what game engine was used, but that it‚Äôs a custom designed one from Avalanche Software.\n\nSome things that weren‚Äôt a big problem was the 1280x800 screen resolution. However it would have been nice to have at least 1920x1080. There was also a part in the game (page 13) for me where I clicked everywhere furiously trying to find something, but it crashed. The only fix was to start again from page 12, because going directly to 13 would end up crashing the game immediately.\n\nFor an adult, it‚Äôs a short game, about 90 minutes long. Those are quality minutes! I definitely recommend this game. Also how often do you get to own a game called Winnie the Pooh. Pooh! POOH! POOH! ‚Ä¶ POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

In the game you play as Winnie the Poo, your job is to collect as many horny pots as possible in a short amount of time without failing the stages. There's 19 levels, all with unique environments. You got the forest, the city, the jungle, the snowy mountain, the volcano, the beach, the ravaging tornado, the firey pits and of course the torture champer room level. All levels have their own music track and it's absolutely beautiful. You got your standard heavy metal and dubstep music playing in the background while you're playing this Dance Dance Revolution type of game. Many would say that this racing game is a bit violent for the average person, but. I think you should give it a try.\nAlso. It's a high performance game, you need to have a big computer to be able to play this.\nI've written the pros and cons below for all you tl;dr people.\n\nPros:\n- Triple A game with beautiful 3D graphics.\n- Great heavy metal music and dubstep music.\n- A wide variety of guns.\n- Collecting horny pots is always fun.\n- 19 amazing levels.\n- Tight controls.\n- Everyone can pick it up and play it.\n\nCons:\n- Can be a bit too violent at times.\n- Some racing segments can be a bit of a pain.\n- High performance game.

Played straight through the whole game with my kids (3yo and 1yo) and we all had a blast.  The game is built to look like a popup book and the narrator reads the story to you.  At times the story will stop and you'll have to click on something on "the page" to advance the story.  The item that needs to be clicked has a blinking outline.  There are other things you can interact with on every page including hidden mini-games, but the "main story progression" stuff is blinking and obvious to even the youngest of children.\n\nYou can even choose to just sit back and have the whole story read to you.  I don't see myself trying this anytime soon, but hey, figured I'd mention it.\n\nIt's near impossible to find games that I can enjoy with my very young children.  Mouse + Keyboard is way beyond their depth and gamepads are too large and confusing to them.  This game gave him a chance to manipulate the mouse for the first time and to sit back and "guide" the action when he didn't feel like clicking himself.  We've tried a bunch of other games together and this is the first one we both had a great time playing.\n\nCan't reccomend this enough if you're looking for a way to spend some quality gaming time with very young children.","February 2","true","4.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I'll attempt to explain why this is def. GOTY material.\n\nLet's start off with the pros to this game;\n\nPRICE:\n\n- The price tag was great. I was lucky enough to pick up this bad boy for a solid 4.49$, which is a steal in my book *pun intended*. In a world were 'Call of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•' and 'Battebarf' are 60$+, this is simply put; Amazing.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\n- The game is original and fresh as it takes place in a story book with a nice 'cuddly' feel. You go through the life of the ever so honey-loving bear, Pooh. While you help Pooh find his honey (or some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like that), you help his friends out aswell! Simply unique and awesome! After coming home from work nothing is better to a slow-paced game of this quality.\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\n- Awesome cast of your fav. Pooh characters! They all are unique and will have you keep coming back! NOTHING MUCH TO SAY!\n\nREPLAY-ABLILITY:\n\n- Most replayable game EVER. You can go through the collection of honey pots and the adventure of Pooh endless times, all while re-finding secret honey pots and random ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in flows and stuff! Def. on of those 'never can put this down' games.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\n\n- One of those most original, bright and replayable games ever-- All packed up w/ your fav. buddies, the Pooh Crew! This game is great for a sad night of drinking-- Or maybe a great game to cope with a break up.\n\nPooh's stellar adventure leaves my jaw dropped with a solid Kappa/10, get this game!","October 7, 2014","true","3.0"," 44 of 85 people (52%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","52","44","85","4","1"

Very emotional and psychological game and it's really nervwrecking. The game had literally 10/10 in everything. Music, gameplay, graphics, story and the fact that you can replay the game whenever you want, takes it to a next gen level. The only complaint I have from a neutral point is that it was way too long. I've been playing for about an hour now and I'm still not done with the first page/scene. A bit hard but very interesting when you proceed. Couldn't really have asked for more.\nHoping for a remake to the consoles soon so more people can play!\nVeryy, verry, v√§rry, pretty game~<3\n\nGames that might be similar are: World of Warcraft, the Resident Evil games and Call of Duty: Ghost","October 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","17","36","2","0"
