It's an alright dialogue-driven adventure game where some of the dialogue is sung, like a musical. However, most of the singing is pretty bad and off-key. This might be a reference to how autotuned mainstream music is nowadays, a topic that the game touches upon. Intentional or not, it did make my ears bleed a bit. The clay models used to depict the characters are hideous and the stop-motion only has a few frames so it never really feels authentic. The story is nothing to write home about, a short slice-of-life about gender equality and a bad economy (and autotuned pop music). Game is quite short too. Took me less than an hour and a half (that's less time than what is required to get the steam trading cards for the game).","March 11, 2014","false","2.1"," 282 of 352 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","282","352","2","6"

Me, I found it boring.  There's no challenge when you can only click what they let you click when they let you click it, and your clicks can't affect the outcome of the game.  You're a spectator here, not a player.  I would describe this as an interactive music video rather than a game.  You will spend 80% of your time watching shoddy claymation figures (an aesthetic choice, I assume, rather than a lack of skill... I hope) talk-sing tuneless songs with straightforward, uncreative lyrics.  The aesthetic was half my motivation for purchasing the game, but I have far less appreciation for it now that the whole experience feels lackluster, and lazy.  I'm sure a lot of hard work went into the game, and I don't really mean to disparage the makers, it's just that because the game is so underwhelming it soured me on everything.

Well you're probably alright stopping there. Not to jump on the negative review train; the game is a pretty harmless and innocent hour and a half with nothing egregious, but what's in the trailer is pretty much all there is to the game, albeit with a predictable detective story tacked on.\n\nFirst off let me just list off why the game intrigued me enough for an impulse buy, so we can compare expectations and see if the game actually lives up to them. I bought this game because:\n\n-it's a musical\n-it's claymation\n-its themes include gender, which is particularly tender and interesting to me\n-it apparently did well in IGF nominations\n-it's only an hour and a half long, which for someone with a massive backlog is actually an incentive\n\nNow that I've played it, my positives are:\n\n-it's one continuous musical adventure, with each screen change being accompanied by new music. The vamp technology\nleading into each character's singing parts isn't perfect but is cool nonetheless.\n-it has a lot of trombone\n\n...And that's about it. Let's break this down further.\n\nThe musical element is the game's most unique and as mentioned above, works well enough. I don't actually have a huge problem with the "grating" voices: to me it along with the point and click mechanics create somewhat of a nostalgic experience. It really feels like a stage show, which is neat. At the same time, there's nothing particularly complex about the compositions, and the game doesn't really embrace the "musical" idea fully, it's just kinda there.\n\nThe claymation is very crude and pretty much a gimmick. It's very low resolution assests with no graphic options to speak of.\n\nThe gender theme isn't near as prominent as I expected and rather forced, thankfully it's not offensive but it's also not trailblazing.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes there's very little to speak of, just exhausting dialogue options. This isn't inherently bad, there are great games like Attack of the Friday Monsters that use this so as to not feel gamey or proprietary in any way. But that's the thing, you'll still be navigating basic menus for most of it so the fact that this is a very shallow, simple game will always be in the forefront of your mind. That said, it is simple enough for anyone to play and you won't get frustrated or stuck.\n\nThe story is the primary focus of the game, and it's pretty disposable. For one it's indulgent; you're thrown in with little context and immediately expected to care about the characters with no concept to guide the experience. The game constantly repeats information you've just heard back to you. It's pretty humorless; there are bits of overdone social commentary here and there that are really random and don't fit in with anything else: this is unfortunately the extent of the game's themes. And in general it's all pretty incidental, with a lack of finese to the storytelling, and it's just not at all cohesive! For all its twists and turns it never does anything unseen in other point and clicks or noir. The ending at least had potential to satisfy and bowtie all the elements but it feels unfinished, like the last 15 minutes are part of a different game.\n\nSo yeah in the end it's just kinda boring, you know? It's one of those cases where you have to take a step back and realize that just because it's cool as a trailer doesn't mean it'll be cool as a game, especially since it never explores any of its enticing elements. Still, on sale for a quick runthrough you can do a lot worse.","May 15, 2014","false","1.8"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","36","43","0","0"

My CD collection is almost entirely made up of Broadway cast recordings.  I also like to play video games.  A musical video game sounded like a great concept, and it still does.  This is hardly a musical, though, because there aren't any real songs.  There's dialogue that's written in rhyme and just happens to be sung.  There are no melodies, and that's the joke.  And this joke becomes very grating very quickly.  There's only so much off-key singing you can take!\n\nThe story isn't very interesting.  Trying to solve the mystery will pose a slight challenge, but you'll still get through it in about an hour and it wont have any lasting impact on you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agentofevil/recommended/270310/","agentofevil","hellafun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agentofevil/","4058 products in account","I cautiously recommend this, cautiously only because it's not a game for everyone; if you're in the right audience though, it's a hilarious and fun, although short ride of an adventure game. It's a game about wierdos, for wierdos, presumably made by wierdos.\n\nAlthough there are multiple endings (which seem to be determined only by the final choice), the game itself is pretty short. A single play-through takes about an hour. The game mechanics are simple but completely workable: you click on items on the screen to get dialogue or action options, or add things to your inventory. Most of the interactions are in the form of (frequently sung) dialogue, although there is some light puzzling, but it's mostly in the form of bouncing between locations as you open further dialogue options.\n\nThe story is cute and cleverly written. It's also pretty socially consious, but not annoyingly so. For the right audience, there are many clever bon mots and allusions peppered throughout the dialogue. The singing is horrible and off-key... but that's part of the charm. The story revolves around economic depression and autotuning in the music industry. It also playfully touches on gender identity in a way that makes me wish the game had been a bit longer and that had somehow been more of a story point.\n\nThe graphics... well, I think it's self-evident from the screenshots above. The models and animation are exceedingly simplistic, but they're charming in a Gumby kind-of way. I think the graphics work well in light of the humorous tone of the game, but your mileage may vary.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed the game, and hope this is not the last we see of Dominique Pamplemousse. If you like quirky, cleverly written off-beat games, give this one a shot, especially if it's on sale. But if you find out-of-key singing and simplisticly built and animated clay models to be grating, spend your money and time elsewhere.","March 12, 2014","true","1.1"," 83 of 139 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","83","139","0","1"

It mostly fails at all these three things, mainly by looking, sounding and playing as the work of an amateur. The art style is distinct, but the stop motion isn't all that good. Still, it's charming. The music and highschool-musical-theater singing are also kinda charming, at least once you realize that the singing is off key and rather bad "on purpose", but you still can't call them good. The point & click elements are barely there, with no real choices and no real puzzles, just serving to move you forward in the story.\n\nI think what really tipped this over to no for me was the story. It's very much on the nose. It's got some points to make, and instead of building them organically into its storytelling, it just repeats them over and over. We are never really allowed to empathize with the characters: Instead of watching them deal with the world and its problems we are being told what their problems are and are expected to feel something from that. Good storytelling doesn't really work that way. So if one of the goals of the game was to make us think about gender and the economy, it very much falls flat. Instead of sounding humorous and lighthearted as it seems to attempt to, it feels awkward and preachy.\n\nSo an interesting little amateur experiment, the first commercial game of a single developer working on their own, trying out a relatively novel idea. I didn't regret the cup of coffee I paid for it with the discount, because the aesthetic is charming and  because it didn't overstay its welcome, but that doesn't mean it's a good game.","June 22, 2015","false","2.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

When I first saw this game in the Steam Store it had mixed reveiws. But this game is not all that bad. Yes, there are bad things about it, that's why there are negative reveiws, but I must say the game was worth the money I spent on it.\n\nThe bad traits of this game are clearly and without doubt, bad things. There's no arguement that make the bad traits go away, but the good traits do outweigh it. Firstly, the game is quite short, surprisingly short. This SHOULDN'T be a surprise though, when you think about how hard claymation is to do, how long it takes, and it's clear that the game makers put a lot of effort into rhis game, just not enough to make it a full length game, and obviously the time  also depends on how good you are at completeing the game.\n\nSecondly, the voices, Dominique Pamplemousse is about singing, about the music industry and opera. The bad singing voices at the start of the game are really cringeworthy, they make you feel uncomfortable, because we are not used to listening to people sing normally, and this game perfectly demonstrates that, (which is on of the reasons I love it!) it shows that some people sing normally. The singing is not so much bad, as normal. After a few minutes of the characters all singing you get used to it, and playing a game with an opera sort of stlye can get quite enjoyable, when you realise the voices aren't really THAT bad. And it's such a special experience seeing someone in a musical type setting who doesn't have a strangely perfect voice.\n\nThe game makes a lot of claims. It claims that it is a game about gender, and economy, which it really isn't about that much. Yes, the protagonist is non-binary, and appears to express their thoughts about thism, and having all the rest of the characters confused about the protagonist's gender. It is clear that this game planned for this to be a big theme, but it didn't really turn out that way, because the game is clearly too short for them to have any discussions about gender or even the economy.\n\nDominique Pamplemousse does seem to have some bad things about it, but it is really worth buying, as it is a beautiful claymation game, and I really am in love with any type of claymation, or any game made with real life materials. This game really has some nice subtle discussions on auto-tune and the music industry, which is not a common plot for video games to have. This game is also in black and white, which is another rare thing for video games, as video games are too advanced to have really gone through a black and white period (if you don't count the time when games could only be in two colours) as televisions did.\n\nOne last little touch on this nice game, which barely has anything to do with the game, is that it has DLC that you can buy that will give you the sheet music, and sheet music is such a lovely thing to buy as DLC, which is really the whole reason I bought it, but I enjoyed it past the sheet music. This game isn't really that expensive and not really that long, but if you have around $5 you should think about buying it.","January 15","true","1.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Well, then! This may be the game for you. But then again it may not be, as I'm one of those people and yet I still failed to enjoy this game.\n\nIf you received Dominique Pamplemousse: It's All Over When the Fat Lady Sings for free or in a random bundle, there isn't too much harm in trying it out. If that's not the case and for some crazy reason you're thinking of buying it, I desperately urge you to reconsider because I don't know what I've been doing for two hours listening to the horrendous singing in this point and click detective story.\n\nI got my copy like a lot of others, through my Humble Bundle purchase. The content is exactly what you see in the game trailer above where you get to click on things and listen to the characters talk/give clues into the case you're on while you, as the player are immobilised while characters sing their hearts out with a monotonous atmosphere.\n\nI played this for an hour on my own but then I closed it but when I tried to play it again the next day. It had failed to keep my progress so I spent the remainder of my time using a walkthrough to push through. I like to try and finish games but this one was more like, 'Come too far to turn back at this point...' I'd got stuck anyway as I hadn't thought to look under Devon's bed and was running around in circles. If you stick to reading/exhausting everything then you won't get stumped as easily as there is literally nothing that you can do wrong in this game to change an outcome. There is a choice at the very end but even that has little merit to game play so meh. This is still a preference of mine for point and click mystery titles as it keeps the experience pleasant (if a little boring) and away from unwarranted stress. I don't actually play this genre after becoming overly frustrated whilst playing Sam & Max Hit the Road as a little girl (even though it's now a classic).\n\nMy admiration for stop motion animated work like the world famous, Wallace and Gromit series as well as full length features such as The Boxtrolls is on constant overflow. But with Pamplemousse it is akin to watching a tragic and horrific instalment of musical theatre and not being able to up and leave because you're lodged smack in the centre of a hot, stuffy hall along with all the other people who also are not enjoying themselves but ended up stuck there. I can only imagine how hard the creator worked to make this so I'm appalled at myself for having to leave such a negative review but as a game this feels more like those demo CDs you used to get for free in the 90s after buying some other popular game.\n\nWhat's great is that you can multitask while in game, though. It opened in my Adobe Flash Player and so I could keep it running and minimise it while checking my email or I could keep focused on the story while eating dinner. You can also click to fast-forward/skip the talking in between though you have to put up with all the singing.\n\nThe story is all right and the characters are likeable. It was fantastic to see a genderqueer protagonist and also watch how the other characters started flailing at whether Dominique was "a girl or boy". It has light humour but you'll have to lower your expectations more and also find a way to get past the horrendous singing. I actually could take it no longer (though the voice acting was solid) and watched/played it like a black and white silent film by taking out my earphones and reading the subtitles for half of the game.\n\nThough it is all right to play yourself if you're set on doing so and have the time as well as patience (the singing... it burns!!), the Dominique Pamplemousse guide by Burger is a good way to breeze through it in half an hour if you'd prefer.\n\nUnfortunately, I dislike this game the most out of all the Steam games I've played so far. :( It's cute but I will not touch this game(?) ever again.","March 7, 2015","false","2.5"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

And from what I've researched the game developer is not super experienced so I want to put this into the 'it's the first game I made' pile... I mean heck the website said it was mostly filmed with a freakin iPad. So lets not be too judgemental.\n\n! That being said ! The singing is truly awful, but it's funny. When they started singing, and they were out of key and the stop motion animation looked like it came from high school students my initial reaction was - urg. However, as I proceeded the terrible singing and non sensical lyrics became funny and charming. What I did enjoy was the music. Check out this youtube clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=17&v=2mWDV5IiwRc of the band responsible for the soundtrack.\n\nThis game takes at the most two hours to complete so don't expect complex gameplay.. in fact don't expect any gameplay. However this is a good case for Dominique Pamplemousse because I swear if this game was even ten minutes longer I would have punched my computer. It is meant to be a short game... It's kinda like that one friend you have that's fun to be around in small doses because they're silly and quirky but if you spend more than an hour or two with them you're ready to pull their tongue out and feed it to the wolves.\n\nWorth the experience if the game is free or if it comes with a nice little bundle.  NOT WORTH $5 ON ITS OWN\n\n5/10","March 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

The game has a really interesting premise, but it tends to get buried under the creator’s “messages”.\n\nLong version:Dominique Pamplemousse is a crowd-funded adventure game made by an independent developer, Deirdra Kiai. On paper. In reality it is a claymation musical with little gaming involved.\n\nThe presentation looks amateurish and cheap, but it seems like an artistic choice; I have to admit, it adds a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The same cannot be wholeheartedly said about the singing (all done by the creator itself), as it is often off-key. Which, oddly enough, fits the plot: the player takes the role of the titular character, a private detective, who is hired to find a pop star, but eventually gets entangled in the shady voice-manipulation plots of a record company.\n\nFor the most part, the story works. Except when it is stopped to repeatedly convey Deirdra’s message about gender identity and financial issues. These out-of-place topics don’t ruin the game, but they certainly made this cheap, short, but sweet title a little less excellent.","April 20, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Dominique Pamplemousse is a game that oozes hipster indie style, and that's not my interest. But the game is short and sweet enough that I'm happy with it as a bonus to a Humble Bundle. Check out some clips to see if you have any interest.\n\nThe game is flawed but charming, short but a complete tale. I normally hate on Flash designs, but the game is short enough to complete in one sitting (30-60 minutes) so save-loss doesn't hurt so much. The game reminds me of the 90's; the modern environment would never fund the quirky games developed then. Gameplay is simple point-click adventure, but nothing is really clunky or poor. The singing can be annoying but never bothered me enough to stop it. The story was odd but generally worked.\nMy main irritation: Why frame Dominique to be removed from the scene? The easier alternative was to not hire that detective in the first place. Dominique already resigned to losing the research years ago.\n\nI enjoyed the game, more than others which I've gotten for free or in a bundle. I'll admit, the game should probably be fully free but there are free methods to enjoy the game if you really need. The game could be polished and improved, but I would be interested in a sequel. It's odd and campy, but I found it entertaining for an evening. I'd recommend a sale, but the game is unique enough that you should determine how much you're willing to pay yourself, no discount target from me this time.","March 25, 2015","true","7.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Hideously catchy.\n\nI love claymation, and even though this is super low-end budget style, I liked the characters and backgrounds.  Animation is not very varied but it gets a... thing of sort... across.\n\nAfter the first scene or so, the overt cheesiness of the constant amateur singing of the majority of the dialogue wore away.  It really is nice how the music score rolls right along and the dialogues always queue up to hit the beat right when they ought to.  It's a neat effect requiring only momentary pause, and feels really natural in a sort of... absurd impromptu musical.  I liked the score quite a bit and, partnered with the timing of the singing, it honestly felt like the most polished part of the game.\n\nThe plot is admittedly pretty silly and nothing worth writing home about, but it might give you a weird kind of chuckle.\n\nThe gameplay was very simple, a brief point and click adventure.  I've played a handful of point and clicks, and this one, while it required no massive leaps in logic (which is good), it was far too easy (which is bad).  Regarding variation, there's far more interrogation of the characters (which makes sense given the musical platform) than there are backgrounds to be searched and interacted with.  Finally, there isn't a lick of puzzle element in this game, which I find to be kind of irregular for the genre, but to each its own, I guess.\n\nThe kicker, it was super short, a shade more than an hour.  (Additional "playtime" was spent waiting for card drops.)\n\nTo sum it up, weirdly catchy tunes, too easy, odd visuals, and too short.\nGet it on sale if you're feeling frisky, I guess.","June 20, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

There is, as far as I could tell from my short playthrough and from looking at videos online, very little gameplay, which means its success hinges upon the quality of its visual and musical aspects. Visually, it presents a striking aesthetic, which might please some; musically, however, I find it to be a failure, as the lyrics are uninspired and the melody monotonous.

The premise was somewhat intriguing and the environments were actually >adequate. I kept playing to see where the game would lead; I discovered more of the same, but grew to enjoy even the worst aspect (except having to call the Officer to the cell over and over - not really a big deal either, though).\n\nThis is truly one of those games that is "so bad it's good."\nThis is actually a game that took skill to make and was intentionally made (")poorly(").

That statement doesn't sound too appealing, so why would I recommend it?\n\nIt is unique. Visually the game is pleasing and pictured from simple cardboard and plasticine type models. The main interest in the game is the singing of the characters. They sing in a kind of poetic way and with voices that are clearly meant to confuse certain issues. The main character him/herself is rather an enigma. One voice sounds just like the character 'Rudi' from Steve Wright's Radio 1 afternoon show of the late eighties / early nineties ('Let me innn, Let me innn')\n\nThe story itself is straightforward, though with a couple of neat twists and turns. It's probably almost impossible to fail in this game as it mostly told through exhausting all the dialogue options. There are a couple of easy puzzles in there too though.\n\nI honestly don't think I could have stood the game had it been much longer, as the voices are of limited appeal after a while, but for the hour and a half to two hours it takes to play it, this was thankfully not an issue.\n\nThere is an interesting choice to be made at the end, which I guess gives it some replay value.\n\nFor the low price, it's a good couple of hours worth of entertainment.","November 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The crude choppy claymation, the characters singing with the quality of a middle school musical, severely shoehorned rhymes, it's something that you'll find charming or downright annoying.\n\nNext is the setting, the style is clearly made too look like 1940's black and white crime dramas, and includes most of the tropes. BUT you get these references that clearly place this in present day (twitter, auto-tune, etc.), and the dissonance that this creates is as unique as it is hilarious.\n\nAll of the plot exposition is in song, which as I've said before you'll love or hate. Each character has their own melody that reflects their personality. The plot itself, however, isn't very remarkable and you'll see the twist coming a mile away.\n\nThe gameplay is definitely the weakest element of the game, very simple point and click mechanics and puzzles that aren't very difficult to solve, it's just a means to an end to carry the exposition.\n\nOh, and the main character is genderqueer, which I wasn't expecting. The game doesn't really make this a main part of the story or anything, it's just a passing fact, which I found pretty cool. And the way they deflect other characters' prodding question as to their sex/gender is both masterful and hilarious.","November 24, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That's it.  Characters just stand in place and talk.  Also, the character design is hideous.  It does not look "artistic."

It's not very musical at all, and the singing is often difficult to sit through because it's very drawn out and... unpleasant to the ears.  I admit the singing is probably supposed to be bad (which makes it funny), but without some context and better writing, it's just bad singing.\n\nThe game promises a detective story, but it lasts maybe an hour.  Not enough time to get to know the characters, or the setting.\n\nThe game promises to be about the economy and gender identity, and I get the feeling the creator has something to say about them, but it doesn't come across here.  Both are mentioned a few times, but neither is important to the tiny story.\n\nThere was potential in this project if it had been better executed.

I'm not one for musicals, or things being sung overly much or at all in media but the style of the game grew on me. I do play music so I have a decent sense of styles and the scores in Dominique Pamplemousse were effective at creating atmosphere and characters.\n(Some people may find the 'music' offensive but I guess my attitude at the time helped to remove a lot of stigme which allowed me to actually 'enjoy' the game as what it is)\n\nThe plot slowly builds as you progress through the game and it gains a bit of depth, twisting a few times, before ending.\n\nAfter reminiscing about the game for quite a while, I wish the game had a bit more to its ending.\n\nAll in all, the game is niche, probably not for all, but if you're looking for something REALLY borderline.... everything, go ahead and try it.","December 5, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

If it only happened occasionally it would still be ok,  even slightly funny...but when almost every conversation is sung it gets a little grating ...that said I was willing to plough through regardless just to see how the story ended, and I'd guess I got about halfway, but then the game exited unexpectedly and I hadn't saved for awhile.....many months later I'm still trying to work up the resolve to replay back to where I was before and continue.....maybe if I switch the volume off.....\n\nGive it a try by all means, its quirky and the style has a certain charm.....but for the sake of your ears  play in short bursts and FOR THE LOVE OF SANITY remember to save after progress is made, just in case.","February 7, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It’s character. Dominique Pamplemousse believes so strongly in its characters that everything else — even gameplay — is secondary. Tons of gameplay hours, plenty of missions and activities with an awesome collection of vehicles of various modes of transportation and a large array of firearms put the grandeur once again into Dominique Pamplemousse. This game deserves a better user score. I hope nobody takes it serious, because there are a lot of butthurt fakevotes.\nWell to the game. This is the Dominique Pamplemousse you've always been waiting for! Yes it's true. You loved San Andreas because of gameplay? You loved Vice City because of music and atmosphere? Dominique Pamplemousses innovation? Dominique Pamplemousse's story? Well I'll explain.\n\nThis Dominique Pamplemousse brings it all together. The playing of three characters at once goes really smooth, it feels just how it should be, shooting and driving is really fun, it's kinda a mix between the realistic driving in Dominique Pamplemousse, arcade driving in Midnight Club, and shooting from Max Payne 3, and this is perfect!\nThe missions are fun again, many people thought Dominique Pamplemousse had too similar missions, and I thought so too, but now you'll never get bored I assure you! The story is really well written, won't write more about that cause there is a lot to spoiler.\nAs many a gamer have stopped by to pen thoughts on this game so shall I .\nSimply put Dominique Pamplemousse is my game of the year since i am going to avoid cod ghosts. The story-line is epic and the characters are hilarious.The story is very well written If you take time to do side quests you will enjoy the main missions even more and boy are they enthralling.\nWhats not to like thinks to shoot and people to blow up... EPIC.\nThe world is really massive, the countryside isn't boring at all, and seriously, who wasn't missing that after Dominique Pamplemousse? I don't know how R* did this, but even the graphics improved, while the game is bigger over all.\nYou can do so much stuff in Los Santos and it's countryside, it's unbelievable that it is just one game! I played for at least 20 hours now, and I have so much more to see and explore, just crazy!\n\nWell what else can I say? Buy it Play it yourself and agree! It's a really good game\nWhen analyzed in its purest essence, Dominique Pamplemousse not only proves to be an excellent title, but also a game that is able to make a sublime parody of today's society, taking advantage of all the excesses and insanities to which the world is slowly getting used.\n\nxD","April 18, 2014","true","35.7"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","0"

It's pretty short, but i enjoyed every minute of it and the slightly rough presentation doesn't get in the way at all (i love it, personally). It's got a lot of heart and character. The story's good, and although you can probably see some things coming, there's a bunch of unexpected twists, too. It never gets boring.\n\nThe interface is good. There's no pixel hunting, background objects have interesting and funny descriptions (all voice acted), and exhausted dialogue options are marked, so you'll never accidentally repeat a line of questioning if you don't want to. Also, the game keeps track of what Dominique knows, so you won't forget anything important. Sometimes in conversations it's not immediately obvious if someone's done talking or if they're waiting on a cue to sing (they have to wait to sync with the music), but it's not a big problem; you never have to wait for very long. At worst i was happily surprised when someone suddenly burst into song =)\n\nThe puzzles are logical and mostly pretty easy to figure out, but they're not really the focus of the game. Play it for the atmosphere, the humor, the story and the music.\n\nIt's a unique game, and you shouldn't miss it. Highly recommended!","May 11, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

What if i ask, if you played a Point a Click Musical game. If you answered no to both of those questions i wouldn’t be 100% surprised. Dominique Pamplemousse is probably the first of it’s kind that i have ever seen. A point and click detective musical game. it’s sort of hard to picture it while i even write it down; and I’ve played the game. But Dominique Pamplemousse has heart thats heading towards the right direction of innovation, creativity and a bit of nonsense.\n\nFirst of sure Dominique Pamplemousse is NOT a fun game to play. It is as basic as a point and click game can be. You see something out of the ordinary and “boom!” you click it. The only difference in this game, is that almost ever dialogue is sang in a musical tune. Crazy as it sounds the game does have plenty of character. Although it seems that there is only one voice actor for ALL 9 or so characters, you can tell that the developer of this game had a blast making it. As i said earlier the game is all animated in clay. As odd as it is, the animation sorta fits with the musical theme. sorta not that great. There isn’t lip moving when the characters talk, instead they just move the mouth up and down over and over. The singing in the game is extraordinarily terrible! A lot of off keys, and most of the time it feels like the singing is forced into saying words really quickly just to keep up the tune.\n\nAside from all of that i was really quit interested in the story. Sure a lot of points the story is very cliche, but once the game was over i was feeling for some more Pamplemousse action and of course singing. I hope the developer doesn’t quit on this style of game. Unfortunately we live in a time where there isn’t as many creativity in video games as there use to be, and this game really brought a smile to my face to know it’s not gone. I’m glad a game like this exits and i hope to see more, but maybe next time, i would like it longer then 1hr and of course with more voices.\n\nI definitely want people to play this game, it’s $5 right now for the deluxe edition which includes the SHEET MUSIC (come on, how many games come with sheet music) and soundtrack. As i said, i WANT people to play this. I don’t expect people to like it and i understand but it just seems like a game, personally to me, that i did not want to miss.","April 3, 2014","true","2.0"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

It's been made by one person whom from what I can tell, hasn't made a game before. It's got all the thing you expect as standard in a point and click game. Although it was refreshing to not have to do the "try to combine everything with everything else in your inventory" trick.\nThis actually game actually has you checking around your surroundings, though those are small and it's not exactly hard to work out what's important in the room.\n\nI like the fact this game was created using actual physical materials and animated in stop motion. As I mentioned above it does mean that objects of importance are very easy to spot though.\nThe sad thing is that the weakest element of the game is what it sells it self as, it's a musical. Unfortunately the songs grate quickly and the the singing isn't exactly at a professional standard. I don't know if that's intentional (due to the storyline etc) but I found I had to actually turn off the speakers at times.\n\nThe storyline is interesting, but I found quite easy to guess the plot twist. The game is also quite short, I completed it in just over an hour. I would not recommend getting this at the current price (£3.49) wait until it comes on a steam sale.\n\nSo my verdict. Get it if you want something unique and interesting. But don't expect a lot.","June 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

However, what we have on hand here is Dominique Pimp-...Pampel-...Pumpernick..Whatever. A Flash game created by an independant games designer with an ear for catchy tunes and memorable lyrics.\n\nThis game is presented in the style of clayfighters 64, or The Neverhood, with a heavily Noire-ish turn and grayscale colouration. The character figurines are rough, simple and yet manage to be recognisable and easily identifyable. This is helped in no small part by the voice acting, with varied voices provided for all the characters. While certain characters' voices might fall apart in some musical segments, on the whole, the song fragments are well-written and do a fine job of explaining the situation or the topic presented.\n\nThe story follows Dominique, the PI of indeterminate gender with an effeminate voice on his/her mission to find a missing pop star. The story does play into some twists and turns, and while some of them are obvious, or heavily foreshadowed, none of them are jarring with the story. The game is heavily linear, though, with only a single solution present to each puzzle until the ultimate choice at the end. So unless you wish to trawl for trading cards, there's very little reason to replay the game.\n\nif you like musicals, or games with a certain sense of silliness about them, then this game may be for you, if you can forgive the fact it's coded in flash. (encoded rather loudly, I might add) For veteran point-and-click gamers, though, it will ultimately prove to be a relatively shallow entry into the genre, carried somewhat by a fun and catchy musical score.\n\nMy positive reccomendation, then, does have some caveats to it. If you play an instrument, splurge on the sheet music for a few short pieces to play.","March 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 11 of 30 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","11","30","0","0"

It's the type of game where it's more of a visual novel, with not much in the way puzzles or logic tricks that you would expect from the average point-and-click adventure.  There are often moments where characters are having a conversation, and you are essentially just clicking the "next" button to hear the rest of it.\n\nThis is by no means a bad thing, though. A video game format can be used to deliver a story in a more nonlinear way that wouldn't be possible in any other medium. Just don't go in expecting much challenge.\n\nThe story itself actually had me pretty entertained and interested all the way through, with the twists and mysteries in the story being pulled off surprisingly well. There were also a few clever lines that ranged from making me smile to letting out a little chuckle.\n\nI really enjoyed the musical element of the game. There's background music on each screen, and on some dialogue options, the characters will sing their lines in time with the music. The singing itself can be a little off-key at times, but I honestly enjoyed that. It added some charm. I'd really like to see the "singing along with the background music" done more in games. The background music is also really charming by itself, and I rather wish the soundtrack available for purchase would have included the instrumentals.\n\nThe game's description says it is a game about "gender and the economy", and while these subjects are touched on a few times, it's usually little more than a mention, and doesn't end up affecting the plot at much, which was a little disappointing. The game is really more about corporate intrigue and the music industry.\n\nDominique Pamplemousse is a fairly short game, clocking in at a little over an hour for me, and zero replayability, but for only five bucks, I would recommend it if you like mysteries and visual novels.","March 12, 2014","true","1.5"," 30 of 71 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","30","71","0","0"

Magic, right? Well, kinda.\n\nDominique Pamplemousse in “It’s All Over Once The Fat Lady Sings!” is a combination of all those things. Using real clay characters, animated in the stop motion style, Pamplemousse tells the story of wealth inequality, gender politics, and detective work, while having the characters break out into song.\n\nAt times, this makes the game transcend all media I have seen, while you and your angry landlord have a singing fight while you run around the apartment looking for money, while at times, it hits the wrong note, sometimes quite literally.\n\nThe voices, including the singing ones are all done by one person, and all are "in character" when they sing, which unfortunately makes encounters with characters unbearable, as the teenager predictably has voice cracks, pops, and is generally off key quite a bit.\n\nThere's evidence in the game to support the theory that the unprofessional singing, and out of key songs is intentional, but it still is incredibly off putting when it rears it's head.\n\nThe art style is unique to say the least. This isn't the first time an adventure game, or any game for that matter has been stop motion animated, but each puppet is stylized as if it was made in pre-school, and the rest of the game tries to follow suit. Compared to the serious model quality of Aardmann (Wallace and Gromit) or Laika (Coraline), it's a refreshing take on the way stop motion models are made and animated, each character only having a few key frames of animation they run through.\n\nThe gameplay is less adventure game than I would have hoped. There are objects in the few environments that the game throws at you, that you can click on and interact with, and there are 2 light puzzles that shouldn't be too hard to get past. The rest of the game is carried out through dialogue boxes, where you interrogate people with the evidence you have found so far, occasionally causing a character or 2 to break out in song, singing about their feelings on a topic.\n\nDominique Pamplemousse is nominated for 4 IGF awards including the grand prize, and it's easy to see why: its fresh, clever, and thoughtful. However at times, it falls short of being astonishing, and ends up being mostly OK, with a few really great parts thrown in.\n\nIf you like strange, experimental games, you should probably give Pamplemousse a shot, its out there, clever, occasionally funny, and presents an interesting idea to the table: a musical video game. If it looks too strange for you, it probably is. It's quirky and weird, and that just may be it's downfall.","March 14, 2014","true","1.2"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","3","17","0","0"

I find the broad spectrum of real, normal, broken, annoying people to be refreshing - this is not a game that plays to the status quo of hetero-normative, masculine-centered culture that most gamers would like to imagine is real. Instead, we're thrust into the middle of a world where the protagonist just has better things to do than worry about gender identities and where every character has obvious fatal flaws.\n\nIs this game for everyone? No, probably not. People who are incredibly judgmental and don't have the spark to enjoy unique creations from others should probably stick to mainstream titles. But for those who like to experience new and different things, this game is a brief look at the design skills of an up-and-coming Indie darling.

This will either be a charming, lovable, funny little game. Or an annoying, boring, droned out mess. For me personally, it's certainly the first option. The game is VERY linear. It isn't really hard. It isn't all that long either. Knowing all the right options you could probably beat the game in like, 30 minutes. Many people are complaining about the awful singing. These people have missed the gag in that. The singing is supposed to be bad, that's the comedy of it. I feel as if the story is pretty original for what it is. I've always had an interest in stop motion animation this game has....LIMITED stop motion. Typically the same re-hashed animations in different scenes. If there was a nit pick problem from me this would probably be it. You really start to notice the reuse of animations and it gets a little bland in that respect. But the charm of the backdrops, characters, designs, and soundtrack make up for it. The soundtrack fits the atmosphere the game is going for very well. It's weird, wonky, and oddly amusing to listen to. However, staying in one area for too long. You'll notice the looping nature of the tracks, which CAN get a bit grating. The games fun comes from the humor in the characters jokes, as well as the laughs from the absolutely awful singing. Overall, the good outweighs the bad. If quirky small projects with quaint little attempts at humor is your thing, then this game would be for you. However, if musicals, claymation, simple games, or kinda blander humor aren't your thing skip past this game.\n\nOverall for me 8/10 Would buy again.","May 19, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I read very quickly, and so more often than not I skip ahead once I'm done reading text even if the character is still talking-- but I couldn't do that with this game. I understand that skipping would have ruined the rhythm of the songs etc., but really, there was no rhythm in the first place.\n\nI appreciate where the game was trying to go (discussing gender equality, sexism, a horrible music industry, etc.), but it was just really, really strange. A claymation musical with gameplay centred entirely around dialogue options sounds like a not-great idea-- not necessarily bad, but not great-- but when the singing is bad and the claymation looks a bit hellish, I think that you're going to have a bad time with a game. It's also rather short, so I suppose if you really wanted to see what it was about, you could buy it and then return it immediately (I doubt you'll keep it in your library).

I do appreciate it for its uniqueness. It's essentially a really stripped down adventure game. It's in black and white, claymation and the characters sing a lot of the dialogue.

No doubt it helped that I was drinking beers while playing it, but it was amusing. I appreciate that it strikes out from the cookie-cutter mold and offers something new, albeit also something basic. The twist of the story is a bit unlikely and convenient. The singing was proficient. Sometimes really entertaining, sometimes not so much.

It just embodies the spirit of an indie game. The claymation is wonky (but entertaining) and the story is totally random and just plain silly... I love it and if you have a young heart like I do then I think you will love it too.","December 31, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Look at the trailer and you know if you like it or not.  The background music is catchy as hell and the singing delightfully cringy. Yeah, it's kinda short, the puzzles are incredibly easy and it has next to none replay value. On the other hand it its comparatively cheap and if you are anything like me, you'll have a blast.\n\ntl;dr: recommended.","January 31","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Give it a try.\n\nFull review:\nFirst off, I'll say I'd have never bought this game looking at the description and the trailer, which is what I usually look at when deciding whether to buy a game or not. This said, let me add the fact that I LOVED the game.\nI got it from a Humble Bundle, played the games from the bundle I was actually interested at and let this one sit in my library for about a year.\nWhen I finally decided to play it, I found funny conversations, naïve out-of-tone singing and cute stop-motion animations. Even my girlfriend, who typically neither plays videogames nor finds them interesting, loved it.\nAbout two hours of strategy-free point-and-clicking will lead you to the two possible endings (none of them are very good, I must admit). The game has no difficulty whatsoever (except maybe two or three parts), which in my opinion is not necessarily bad for a game that essentially aims to storytelling, rather than challenge.\n\nIn general, it is a game I'd recommend you to play, under the warning that, as some other comment already stated, you either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it.","July 13, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I do appreciate it for its uniqueness. It's essentially a really stripped down adventure game. It's in black and white, claymation and the characters sing a lot of the dialogue. There's kind of an inventory. Mainly there's just topics of conversation to try with different characters. I had a fun time with it for the hour and a half that it took to finish. No doubt it helped that I was drinking beers while playing it, but it was amusing. I appreciate that it strikes out from the cookie-cutter mold and offers something new, albeit also something basic. The twist of the story is a bit unlikely and convenient. The singing was proficient. Sometimes really entertaining, sometimes not so much. I can see how a lot of people really won't like this game at all. I still did, though. If you're still interested after reading the description of the game, then go for it. It's quite a bit different than you're used to and it won't take too much of your time.","April 5, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I read very quickly, and so more often than not I skip ahead once I'm done reading text even if the character is still talking-- but I couldn't do that with this game. I understand that skipping would have ruined the rhythm of the songs etc., but really, there was no rhythm in the first place.\n\nI appreciate where the game was trying to go (discussing gender equality, sexism, a horrible music industry, etc.), but it was just really, really strange. A claymation musical with gameplay centred entirely around dialogue options sounds like a not-great idea-- not necessarily bad, but not great-- but when the singing is bad and the claymation looks a bit hellish, I think that you're going to have a bad time with a game. It's also rather short, so I suppose if you really wanted to see what it was about, you could buy it and then return it immediately (I doubt you'll keep it in your library).  It can be a good game with some major fixes, but right now I don't think it's worth buying unless you pick it up in a Humble Bundle with some good games.","February 29","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked the unusual and offbeat setting and atmosphere. I'm a big fan of musical theatre and opera and such, so I enjoyed the music and singing of the characters. I think the off-key singing was a bit intentional and I didn't really have any issue with it. I felt it gave the music some variety and character. The story is just ok and the end was a bit abrupt.

Is a solid experience which tries to work as a musical, and thanks to its short length the constant singing won't become tiresome. Is not a complicated game and overall very easy to follow, making it more of a 'click to continue story' rather an adventure game.\n\nHowever the game runs in Flash and has some bugs. In my case i got a gamebreaking bug which made me restart the game. And since you can't skip singing dialog i had to end the final scene watching it in a playthrough rather spend another hour of the same.\n\nIs a game not really worth the time for its gameplay or plot, but atleast tries to be unique and somehow achieves it. If anything having a main character of ambiguous gender is greatly welcome nowadays.","January 10","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prophegy/recommended/270310/","prophegy","Chordus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prophegy/","688 products in account","I am a huge fan of anything stop-motion animated, I enjoy musicals, and bizarre indie games are a guilty pleasure for me.  It should have been impossible for me to dislike this game, but instead, it ended up being one of the worst I've ever played.  I really and truly wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt, but try as I might, I could not find a single redeeming quality.\n\nThe first thing that hits you is the singing.  To call the singing 'music' would be quite generous indeed- the choice of notes breaks every musical convention, but that is overshadowed by the fact that the voice actor can't hit a note to save her life.  The rhythm is all but indiscernible, and the rhyming is strained at the best of times.  The fact that they're selling the soundtrack is a smack in the face.\n\nThe stop-motion is rough as well...  it seems like the developer only chose stop-motion because drawing the characters would have actually been more time-consuming.  There is a fine line between “artistically simplistic” and “shoddy,” and this game qualifies as the latter.\n\nThe game says it's about gender and the economy, but the only mention of gender is a running gag that nobody knows the gender of the main character. My suspicion is that the developer has some personal opinions on gender ambiguity, and I can sympathize with the sentiment, but it seems tacked onto the game, and serves no real purpose towards the plot.  Games with political undertones have their place, especially in the indie community, but it has to be done well.  In that respect, this game fails miserably.\n\nMy final advice is this: don't play the game.  But if you do, just to see what it's about, don't allow yourself to think “it's starting out bad, but it'll probably get better!”  It doesn't.  Feel free to quit at any time...  you're not missing anything.","January 25","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
