No overhead-layer with "strength, dexterity, endurance,...")\n+ the music\n+ not too easy and enough health points to not be too frustrating (your mileage my vary)\n\nBad:\n- NO expanding dungeon! (Did normal mode in ONE DAY) You only get: 4 acts. Each has:  4 maps + 1 boss map.\n- Procedurally generated? Big words for merely swapping around the same rooms.\n- very limited monster variety\n- boring level graphics - although that's the smallest of the problems for me.\n- broken ammunition / weapon design\n\nThe ammunition rules in this game effectively kill most of the fun you could have had with the advertised weapon system:\n- Die in normal mode: lose all weapons !\n- Empty your ammo -> lose your current weapon !\n- Ammunition *as loot* drops only in ineffective doses\n\nIt is not easy to maintan armor repair costs with the loot money. But ammunition cost?! Even if I dedicate all my money to ammunition...\n- I can only buy ammo in town\n- I can only go to town before starting the next map\n- I can only fill up the (250 shot) magazine of the weapon.\nEffectively I had to use the boring one-shot default weapon most of the time because it has unlimited ammo. And only use the cool weapons sparingly. Switching these weapons on and off was an additional annoyance. (HOTKEY?!) Did I mention you lose ALL weapons when you die? I feel betrayed by the ads promising me to shoot one gorgeous pixel wave after another.\n\nThe game design also has other very rough edges. Example: Shooting the containers standing around all over the maps takes multiple shots on most containers. So I stood and fired and waited until they broke - this filled at least 25% of all time I played this game. Very annoying. Although I carried neither armor nor upgraded weapon for a long time to save money, I still needed the money from many of the containers. So why not let all of the containers break on first bullet? It would then turn around the experience and be fun instead - to see all the environment break under my bullets fast and easy. (By the way: More damage does NOT make them break faster. In later levels you even get containers that need MORE shots. FACEPALM! I suspect very short sighted game design here: "These containers look more robust, so I decide they break after 4 shots instead of 3.")\n\nAll that said - I DO like the game.\n\nBut I made it my mission to warn you and tell the truth - which the ads DO NOT.","November 2, 2014","true","11.7"," 110 of 117 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","110","117","2","1"

The dungeon-crawling genre is one we've all come to know and love, but I can't even remember the last time one felt as fresh and unique as Pixel Boy and the Ever Expanding Dungeon. There are plenty of reasons why this stands out among the rest of the bunch on Steam;\n\nMy first moment with Pixel Boy is a relaxing one, with a slightly blurred image of the quaint little pixel town, Resolutia rolling by the title screen as I'm treated to the relaxing melodies of french electro artist Pyramid. I already feel like I'm in a most blissful state. However, this feeling of relaxation quickly ends, as I start the game and am thrown into the confines of a dark, dusty old dungeon and a glowing trail of blue light as my only guide in this confusion. The game eases you into the mechanics using a humorous narrator that reminded me a lot of Professor Frink from The Simpsons. The lines are delivered infrequently enough to not be a hindrance and are actually pretty damn funny.\n\nThe almost Minecraft-like graphics are extremely familiar and nostalgic and work exceptionally beautiful in tandem with it's mellow, almost cosmic sounding soundtrack. You're introduced to the armor and pixel power crafting system which are incredibly dynamic and massive in scope when it comes to the number of possibilities and the diversity shown in their execution. Fiddling around with the vast amount of powerups you come across to see which new powerful attacks you can come up with quickly becomes an obsession.\n\nAfter finding the RGB keys and making it out of the first dungeon alive, you're brought back to the pixel-y town from the title-screen which you learn is your base of operations. This base will supply you with a multitude of features including shops for pixel powerups, armor, crafting, a monster museum to keep track of the enemies you've encountered, and doors leading to each of the main campaign dungeons. There is also a mysterious and colorful fountain in the center of the town which seems to be the source of the bliss enducing melody you hear.\n\nOnce you're done with your introduction to the the town, you will quickly return back to the depths of new dungeons where the pace really begins to pick up, with the music being kicked up a notch going from mellow ambiance to heavy, pulsating rhythms that pump you up for the oncoming journey. The action itself is fantastically solid and fast paced, with an array of stylish monsters and crazy bullet patterns there is a lot going on on the screen at once and it can become a serious sensory-overload in the best way possible. The top-down action combat here is very reminiscent of classics such as Smash T.V. or Pocky and Rocky combined with a weapon combo system similar to Gunstar Heroes and that is a *very* good thing for old school gamers or fans of the golden age of gaming.\n\nThe roguelike elements become strongly apparent here and are just right, with heavy randomized factors to the dungeon even involving a slot machine minigame to help decide the mobs for your current run (A really cool touch to the randomized aspect of these games!) and persistant stats and gold that will carry over between your deaths, making each consecutive and seemingly impossible run that much easier. The dungeons become extremely challenging and you'll be forced to utilize every item you find and every shop you happen to come across, as well as chestrooms which contain useful powerups for you to use (sometimes negative effects for the unlucky) if you're able to find or buy keys throughout the floor.\n\n\nPixel Boy really hits that rogue-lite sweet spot and will feel right at home with fans of games like Full Mojo Rampage or Binding of Isaac who want extreme replayability and even deeper, faster paced gameplay. This is an absolute must-have for any dungeon-crawler or rogue-lite collection.","May 30, 2014","true","33.7"," 127 of 144 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","127","144","0","9"

I was expecting a game with customization, progression, and creativity. It failed to meet my expectations in any of these categories.\n\nRight off the bat it says that it's an "action RPG". I thought this meant all these cool powerups were things I could invest in with things like skill points. No. You just find/buy the powerups and they only last 250 shots. Not much of a point using them except for the 'bosses' which will be discussed later.\n\nYou do level up and get stat points which is cool... but then again it isn't. All you do with your stat points is put them into damage as you do very little. Attack speed? So my powerups can run out even faster? Very lame options here. Just get damage. Zzz...\n\nThe armor system is yet another under delivered concept. Cool you get customizable armor? That sounds great. Oh it breaks after 5 or so hits? Well I guess that's fine... Oh it isn't really customizable? You just pick 5 of the same boring stats (damage x 5)? Hmmm but they have unique effects! Could be some cool combinations! No. It only has 5 types, depending on what type of 'orb' you use the most of. They all are just an effect on when you get HIT, something you should never do. And the effects hardly do anything other than cause lag. Miss.\n\nBosses I mentioned before. I've been to 2 before I stopped playing. The FIRST boss. Even if you put ALL of your points into damage and save all of the powerups for this fight it will take a very long time. It is pointless to use the 'mechanics' of the lightning trap as it seems to do nothing. All you do is run around in a circle at the bottom of the map shooting it... and shooting it... and shooting it. It has a ridiculous amount of health and isn't interesting at all. I finally figured out that the only way to hurt it is the fire powerup. Dumb.\n\nThe 2nd boss isn't much better. Once again it has near infinite health. Boring. Once again it is just a reskinned mob. Boring.\n\nThe mob types are very repetive as are the environment"s". "Act 1 and 2" were the exact same. The same boring environment and mob types, just more hp and probably damage. Horrible.\n\nThere were only 2 things that weren't terrible about the game and even then they were just fine and ripoffs of other games.\n\nThe graphics looked fine. A copy of Geometry wars and Minecraft, but not as well done as either.\n\nThe narrator was okay. Very similar to Bastion to have an involved narrator but nowhere as good.\n\nI regret buying this game. It feels like an alpha or an early access game. Not finished at all and the updates they are planning on adding don't address any of the short comings. Not worth $10, maybe $4. Save your money and get Binding of Isaac if you want a game like this, much better. The large amount of positive reviews I suspect were written by the Devs or their friends/family. I could find no reviews of the game online.\n\nSorry if I was harsh Devs, I do not mean to hurt your feelings but this is a bad game and I feel swindled.","June 7, 2014","false","3.1"," 70 of 98 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","70","98","2","3"

It presents a Minecraft-like environment and it is gorgeous. The powerup combinations are one of the highlights of this game. You can make so many different types of "pixel-weapons" and there is enough for every type of player (I personally am not a fan of the "Spread" weapon power-up).\n\nThe only (minor) problem I have with it is the fact that the enemies are also picked at random for each of the levels. I found myself dying to enemies that I clearly could not do anything to protect myself from very early in the game. This was not something that made the game any less enjoyable because the levels themselves (and the power-ups) are all random so it is always a very good experience regardless.","May 30, 2014","true","0.9"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","0"

Like the reviewers before me I say that this game could use some work, and it seems that all it's really good for is getting that 5 minute feeling of awesomeness from creating the ultimate pixel spammer. However, this game has more than just that.\n\nEffects\n\nHonestly, I HAVE to say that the music is very fitting for the world of Pixel Boy. It makes you feel like you really are in a pixelated world adventuring in dungeons. The narrator is also very funny, throwing great jokes and being quite silly with his netural tone. The world is also quite colorful and many details are put in that you normally wouldn't expect for a $10 game. 9/10\n\nStory\n\nThere hardly IS a story in Pixel Boy, as the entire town and dungeon appears as just another punchline. This CAN work out if you do it right, and I really think they did a good job making sure they didn't need one. 8/10\n\nGameplay\n\nNow here I have an issue. The game itself just feels... empty. As if the developers didn't put it something or got a little lazy. Sure, the dungeon is always randomly generated by randomly arranging rooms, but no matter how you arrange it or whatever value your math textbook says it will add (I know this for myself how tempting it is), you CANNOT cahnge the fact THAT THEY ARE STILL THE SAME ROOMS. The same goes for the enemies. Sure, each level has diffrent mobs, but there are only about 10 or 12 of them. This makes the levels get repetitive after a short time. When Sprial Knights did this, they created HORDES of enemies, easter eggs, and special events. DO IT RIGHT, PEOPLE.  I know the game wanted to focus on the creation of the bullet spammer, the ULTIMATE WEAPON, but the lack of weapon mods limits your creativity more than you'd think. If you're not grinding for your ULTIMATE WEAPON to complete it, you are using it while worrying about AMMO COSTS. Don't listen to those trailers, those people having been playing that game for HOURS AND HOURS on end. It's true that damage is still a little OP. By that I mean it's the MAIN STAT you go for. Armor is completely broken because it's just not worth buying for the lack of creativity it has. All it really does is improve your stats, doing something on HIT (bad ideas are bad) and SAPPING YOUR MONEY THROUGH REPAIR COSTS. Still not worth the coins.  Overall, it feels boring and unnecessary to have such a medicore system.   5/10\n\nOverall, if you've played some bullet hell games like Touhou, and you've always wanted to have that kind of ultimate power, get this game. It probably won't be consuming my time like World of Warcraft and Terraira, but it's worth my $10 and definitely has the pontential to become more.","July 10, 2015","true","3.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

Because this game is WAY better than that above mentioned flash game about a naked baby locked in a basement.\n\nIn all seriousness, I love this game. The controls are super responsive, which is important because ♥♥♥♥ get hectic when you start getting to some of the lower levels. As is the case with most good rouge-likes, the randomly generated nature of the levels means that no two runs are the same. The thing that really sets this game apart though, is the powerup and crafting system. The devs claim there are over 6000 different weapon combinations, and I can believe it. Once you start stacking split and spread shots the game starts looking like a bullet hell shmup that even puts Ikaruga to shame.

I have been looking for a Twin stick shooter rpg for ages. This almost fills the void.\n\nPros:\nThe controls are solid. The character responds well to commands.\nThe music is pretty fantastic.\nThe graphics, while simple, are pretty well done. I love dem square trees.\nYou can feel pretty powerful.\n\n_______\n\nCons:\nThe bullets (pixels) are incredibly glowy. After a few levels, it's just about all you can see. But it doesn't matter much because;\n\nThe game is waaaay too easy. Once you implement resource management and get a few upgraded equips, you neve run out of ammo. Which isn't even a complaint really, I hate ammo hunting, but when I can one shot an entire room and kill the final boss before I get a good look at him, things are a tad too easy.\n\nThe game is waaaaay too short. I put like 3 hours into it and it's done. Which is unfortunate, because I was a lot of fun,\n\nThe interface. It's not pretty, and doesn't offer a lot of information about what you're looking at. For example, if you're crafting and you want to know how much ammo one of your equips have, you have to leave the crafting table, open up your inventory, and equip the item. There are no tooltips, except to tell you what each item does (also not available while crafting). Some simple quality of life enhancements would make this game a TON better.\n\nSmall gripe, the monsters don't die as soon as they take a killing blow, and that can be frustrating. It's like, ok, he's dead, but he still got a hit on you after taking all that damage and oh look, now he explodes.\n_____\n\nThe Breakdown:\nI like this game. I really do. I'm also glad I got it on sale, because at it's current state, I would have felt a tad dissapointed. I DID have fun with it, and I think a lot of people will, but it just doesnt feel complete.\n\nThe BrightSide:\nThe developer is being very active. There have already been a few updates that introduce new features, with more on the way. So if you can bare with it through some of it's growing pains, then I would say it's an absolute buy. Now get out there and shoot some pixels!\n\nGaming on Ubuntu 14.04.

The enemies are challenging, and pose different threats depending on the random selection of what will show up. The powerups are useful and can be combined for different results, none of which are hindering. You can also form temporary armor that has different powers and stat bonuses depending on how you arrange them, so you have many options and lots of replay value.

In some of the dungeons you end up with the easy enemies while in others you have the toughest. But like the narrartor says, you can't just focus on one skill. if you focus on range you can kill from a far but it would take a while since you dont have good damage or rate of fire, then you have too much damage and you have to get close for a shot or two, basically, you have you have it balanced. it does get crazier and crazier but that makes it fun! although i will admit i raged alot about the enemies ending up surrounding you while you can only focus on one for they all shoot at you longer. after you get the lifesteal, it gets easier. This is, like everyone else has said, an addicting game, i can't stop until i die! it is very fun and colorful too! it is cheap right now and i probably will spend more time on this than in other current game by the way the narrator is hilarious!","May 31, 2014","true","3.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

Although it needs a few tweaks here and there, its an overall solid game. The graphic style of this game really suits the name and gameplay. This game is very colourful and action packed. The Mob Maker 9000 and the random(ish) map generation keeps the gameplay fresh. The customisation of weapons and armour is immense, you can technically create it with any combo. And let me remind you that this game came out recently.\n\nYou play as Pixel Boy. You run around weird dungeon things killing weird creature things and picking up weird boxes with weird effects. Weird, but in an excellent way.\n\nPros and Cons:\nPros:\n- Nice graphics\n- Replayability\n- Devs respond to the questions\n- Customisation\n- The soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- Dying screen is a little boring\n- Multiple glitches, nothing gamebreaking though.\n\nI give this game an overall rating of  8.5/10.","June 1, 2014","true","5.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Pixel Boy is a great Rogue Like RPG elements top down dungeon crawler with a random gen dungeon system that creates endless possibilites and incredible replay value! The Music that is done by Pyramid is outstanding and i find myself tapping my foot to the beat with sitting on the edge of my seat tippy toeing around each corner to ensure my safety!

One: I love the graphical feel of it and even though it has a lot of vibrant lights and colors there isn't much in the way of power needed to run the game. Two: The weapon system is a very cool and new thing to me. I have seen some things similar but I have not seen something quite like this. Three: I like that it has the feel of a hack and slash game yet it has no real hack nor does it have slash. I like this game but the game play can become stale and that is a very common thing with this kind of indie came. I would like to see this game become a starting point for new developers but I can't say this game is revolutionary. I can play it for some time, but I end up becoming bored after playing for more than 45 minutes. I would give this game a 3 OUT OF 5 stars because it just can't give me the feel that I can get fro, some of my personal favorite games in this genre like Diablo III or Some other AAA games that can pull me in and always make me want to improve my skill with random armor and other things like that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Richandsteamy/recommended/263080/","Richandsteamy","Tom "Cash4Gold" Guycot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Richandsteamy/","546 products in account","Short version: This game feels slow, boring, and unfinished.  And the game mechanics seem to be working against itself.  That being said, it's probably an okay kids game.\n\nLong version: At first glance, this game seems pretty decent.  Twin stick styled overhead shooter with eye pleasing low poly graphics, responsive controls, and decent music.  But after playing nearly two hours of it, I can say so far it's been very same-y and disappointing.  It's not a roguelike, as I've seen it be referred to as, since there's little penalty for death.  It's just a twin stick dungeon crawler type thing.\n\nFirst off, the combat.  WASD moves the character, mouse shoots.  You can get limited ammo power ups, wear armor, blah.  The enemies are for the most part nonthreatening, so the power ups aren't really vital.  Plus the level design is really claustrophobic.  So enemies will usually be funneling through narrow halls and doorways, oftentimes getting stuck on each other.  The only real danger of being hit is at the start of the floor, when the doors open, and enemies from the adjacent rooms all bum rush you, getting shot from offscreen, or when an enemy decides to hide behind a door frame and ram into you.  And because the game is pretty slow at the beginning, you have plenty of time to react to any encroaching danger, at least if you can see it.  Another serious issue comes from the fact that the enemy ai doesn't seem to know how to navigate the modular rooms, and frequently gets stuck in door frames.  Or if they are a roaming type, end up collecting in a far off corner of the map, no where near the player.  The usually frenetic and fun combat that usually comes from twin stick shooters just isn't here.\n\nThe level design itself, as I mentioned before, seems to be working against the game mechanics.  It's a twin stick shooter shoehorned into tight boxes and hallways.  With the exception of the boss fights, which do open up a bit, the level design is nearly identical boxes and hallways.  There's really no reason to dodge anything when the better alternative is to just run back into the previous room and shoot enemies as they get stuck in the door frame.  There are a few bigger rooms that may spawn, but they usually have a gimmick about them take takes up most of the real estate, but the gimmick is usually 'hold the space bar for a bit'.  And even though the floors are randomly generated, it's hard to tell, because thus far they've all looked nearly identical in layout.  You start on the bottom left corner of the map, next to a set of bonus rooms you can unlock somewhere on that floor.  The exit to the next floor is generally only a few room to the top right, and a tresure chest room reasonably close to that.  And a few square rooms scattered around all of this, hiding exit keys and monsters.  The boss rooms open up a bit, but the bosses themselves are pretty simplistic and easy.\n\nThere's a selection of power ups, but a lot of them seem superfluous.  There's spread and split shots, which seem pointless since there's very few areas that aren't tiny boxes with bottle necks.  You have homing shots, shots that make your bullets bigger, passive bullet shields, single use bomb like items.  You can equip armor that gives you extra hits and passive abilities.  But really, you'd probably just be better off pumping all of your stat points into damage and speed and just using whatever else you might have.  You can also get stat boosting or reducing mushrooms, but they don't really factor in much, since they seem fairly rare, and barely bump your stats in either direction.  So neither risk nor reward.\n\nThe bright spots are the graphics and music.  The graphics are colorful and pleasing, while still having a low poly look.  The overhead prospective is fine, with the exception that enemies can hide behind door frames and get cheap hits on you as a result.  Game runs fine, with the exception of the second boss, which for some bizarre reason tanked my framerate down to almost single digits.  And the music is chiptune-y and reasonably catchy.  Having closed the game out 15 minutes ago, I can't even remember any of the musical tracks already, but it did serve it's purpose of being something inoffensive playing in the background.\n\nOverall, this feels like an early access game that just happened to be put on the full release list.  There's not much content (apparently I'm already half way through the game, and the only reason I have almost two hours in it is because of the slow pace), and the combat doesn't change past the tutorial.

This game is very fun, and addictive, but has some issues, more on that later. Firstly, the game is fun, the "pixel powers" are a unique and fresh feature for a rouge-like game. You get powers like bigger bullets, more spread from your shots, and you can even get flaming bullets, and tons more. You can combine the powers to make them even more deadly!! The enemies you encounter are kinda random, you face against ants, frogs, skulls, snakes, slimes, etc. But each have unique attacks. I have gotten to Act 3 now, and the levels never look the same, which is a cool feature. As you would expect in a rouge-like game, once you die you basically lose everything, except the levels, coins, and attributes you gave your character, but i feel like once you die, you should just restart the game, since you lose all the powers you got, and probably dont have enough coins to resupply yourself, but thats to be expected in a game like this. And finally, the bad things/glitches that might happen. The first bad thing, for me, is that the game is short, only 4 acts, and has little replayability, for me of course, but the devs said they are gonna add daily dungeons, so look up on that. The next thing is that the game kinda feels repetitive, other than the Mob Maker 9000 which randomly generates the enemies, you just look for the same three keys, or the RGB, and then you beat the level, and of course, at the end of each act there is a boss, each one i faced was fun and fast paced, really good fights. Those are the bad things, for me, now onto the glitches that you may get, and the ones i experienced. Some enemies or coins will fly off the level, and end up in the blackness, which makes it impossible to get or kill, and the other one is that the enemies will get stuck in the doors, and just wait for you to kill them. Other than that, no more glitches, that i experienced. Overall, this game was very good, i still havent beaten it, but i will. I recommened this game to anyone who like rouge-like games. 8.5/10","June 7, 2014","true","4.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Deaths can be both more and less forgiving in this rogue-lite genre game. Difficulty ranges from casual and ramps up as you progress to become chaotic with more enemies, bullets, and obsticals to dodge.\n\nThe glitches in the game are fortunately being addressed quickly as the developers seem to respond well to fixing them. They really seem to want to make their game great and not just push something out for a quick buck or ten. That said, there is still some more fixing to go but I'm confident that, like the rest of it, it'll all come together.\n\nSo grease up your keyboard, stretch out your fingers, and shuffle around your mouse for a progressively faster paced game with Pixel Boy and the Ever Expanding Dungeon.","June 6, 2014","true","5.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I almost felt asleep while streaming this game to make people discover it until everybody accorded it would be better to change game.\n\nBinding of Isaac : 6000 different powerful weapons ? The truth is : 20 powers ups you can combine by 3 with 3 slots total (20^3 = 8000). So if you are expecting Binding of Isaac like random items that can give 6000 differents weapon style and different every game or whatever, you are not in the good direction.\n\n<insert any small RPG name here> : I got what i was expecting. SMALL rpg. 5 stats, you can boost each level + Armor crafting (5 slots for 5 components which are the 5 stats) + need to repair the armor. That's about it.\n\nRogue Like : Could have been, but the slow long start kills the fun.

Its not a rogue-like as there is no replay ability after the first time you have experienced. The voice acting and writing is awful, if you want to replay mute the voice.\n\nEdit:\nThe reasons this game is bad:\n\nEnemies are boring and nothing special, the randomiser doesn't achieve anything. I completed the game and didn't see all of the enemies.\n\nBullets are to easy to get, again throughout my one play through, the only time i had to get new power ups was when I died. As soon as i got a level 5 power up i could fire into a room, leave the room and everything would die.\n\nArmour, every single armour "bonus effect" is the same, they all do some type of area damage. Come on is it that hard to have 5 different effects.\n\nPower ups: 6000 combos is bull, you can combine 9 power-ups after that it is maxed out and you just make another 9 until you have 3 which achieves nothing as they didn't seem to stack in effect.\nNot to mention all the effects are boring and unoriginal: homing, big bullets. Come on something interesting, what about firework shots that explode into a colourful AOE, Or like snake shots that fire in the pattern a snake moves. YOU COULD THINK OF ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS.......\n\nThe levels are all the same, just minorly different environments, things like water or snowmen in the level, but it is still the same boring squares looking for keys to go down a level.\nThere should be more than 4 levels, 2 hours for a playthough with no carry on is nothing in a rogue like....\n\nThe art style is cheap and simple, it's just voxels, every single other indie title uses voxels as an easy way out... Voxels have been done before and they are nothing special.\n\nThe music gets repetitive super fast, after 10 minutes I just muted it with the narrator\n\nIm sorry to rain on anyones parade that likes this game, but you are objectively wrong, this game is bad.\n\nAlso, if you die on a run, just start the game again, without loads of money you can't survive.\n\nTL:DR This is not worth ten pounds, enemy design is boring, level design is unoriginal and the game reeks of feces. Go get a fun rogue-like such as rogue legacy which will last you much longer and you'll enjoy.","August 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","51","18","35","7","0"

There is too much emphasis put on doing repeat runs of the same levels. When I finally made it to the first boss, and wasn't successful on my first try (I died), I ended up having to do two more runs of the level before the boss before I was able to save up enough money to get the power-ups and armor that I would need to even beat the boss. I understand that you get to keep money when you die, but when I drop 75 coins on getting some nice abilities that I want to save for the boss battle, and then I end up dying on the level before the boss battle, I end up wasting all those coins. This means I have to do at least one full run through before I have enough money to repurchase everything. I also always seemed to be one damage point behind the amount of armor I could afford to repair. If it cost 80 to repair, I only had 67 coins, but then when I had 80 coins saved up, it then cost 100 to repair the armor. It would be nice if you could improve lesser increments of the armor for smaller amounts of gold. I'd rather put 20-40 gold into repairing the armor temporarily than lose the whole armor and have to use 100-250+ gold to craft a new set.\n\nWhile this game may be similar to The Binding of Isaac, it is not on the same par. There's no sense of dread, no sense of being alone in a world set against you. The atmosphere of this game is lost when the pleasant town is just an elevator ride away. One of the most annoying things though, is having a really nice group of abilities, and you're doing well in a level, and then they all run out of shots, and you're left with the default shot, which is pretty terrible. You can only hope you have found enough gold in the level already (or have some left over from before the level, haha) to purchase a key and hope it's a good ability.\n\nI hope that there are some great updates in the future of this game that help bring it up to a level where I would favorably compare it with The Binding of Isaac. The people involved with this game are really nice, and I hope to see them improve the balance and pacing of the game.","June 5, 2014","false","1.7"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","0"

Even after 30 minutes of grinding and levelling his speed, his movements remained painfully slow. This made the game extremely unenejoyable for me. It did not help that the controls felt imprecise and laggish. One of this game's innovations is a "shielding orb" you can employ to ward off damage. It recharges and is a testament to the game's lackluster controls - you wouldn't need a shield of this sort if the controls were good enough to let you dance your way around enemies and their projectiles.\n\nThe much-lauded soundtrack was your run-of-the-mill chiptune-y tootling. It did not manage to stay with me. The game also implements a wise-cracking tutor who comments on your progress and whose voice I found unbearably nerve-grating.\n\nTo summarize: This game is sluggish, bland and boring. It offers nothing "Binding of Isaac" does not offer, yet it utterly lacks its personality and verve. I honestly regret buying it and can not recommend it.","June 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","0"

Here's why:\n- Dreadful voice acting. Thankfully it let me turn off the narrator right in the middle of the tutorial.\n- Very generic and uninteresting dungeon design, both in the visuals and the layout. Each one has only four monster types, evenly spread around the whole level. So no wondering what awaits you in the next room like Binding of Isaac.\n- You get stuck easily on small obstacles, infuriating when trying to circle-strafe a monster\n- You can't see monsters when they are behind walls or below the doorframe. Coupled with the fact that they can aggro you from nearby rooms, it means they can close the distance hidden and appear right behind you.\n- Shots feel weak (sound effects problem I think), and there's no indication of your range. Aiming with an unconstrained mouse cursor while you can't always reach where you're pointing just feels weird.\n\nSome things look pretty and the music didn't sound bad, and the powerup combining looks interesting, but it's not enough to redeem it for me.","February 16, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","11","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/263080/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Game is super boring and repetitive. You go into a dungeon and go through 4 levels before a boss level. You do this four times, and every time is the EXACT same. Each level has the exact same layout of similar looking square rooms with barrels and boxes in them. No level felt different in the slightest. Each level has a shop/exit room, a secret locked chest room, and 3 hidden colored keys (thought we moved on from that after "Doom" and "Duke Nukem"?). There are about 6-7 total different enemies and each level there is a fake computer slot machine to decide which 3 of the 7, but after you've played a few levels you will have seen them all enough to be super sick of them. For some reason the whole system and mechanics are flawed. Lets start with money. You made money INCREDIBLY slowly. Each level you might make 200 or so, and thats the cost of 1 special weapon shot, or the cost of combining a few types of shots. Each barrel only gives you 1-2 gold, so they are worthless, and even the secret chest that seems like a lot gives you like 100. Oh but lets not forget how there are 5 tiers of armor, and the 2nd one costs 500. Yes it costs about 2-3 levels to afford it. Oh and guess what, it gives you stats and another health bar basically, but its just like health, which goes down super quickly, and once its gone, its completely gone, and you're out 500 bucks and 2-3 levels of gold farming, and it usually is gone by the first or second level you use it. You can repair it while its low, but oh wait, thats 150-200, about equal to what you get per level, meaning you can't repair it until you beat the level, but if you lose it during the level its too late. Horrible system and made me not want to use it. Why cant you sell things you pick up to make extra money you ask, as you will get multiple extra shots and will have like tons of materials each level when you only need 5, and can't use more for some reason, to make armor. But oh wait, those semi-rare shots you picked up, they sell anywhere from 1-2 gold to 10 gold, meaning they don't do sh!t for your gold. Oh and those materials that have tons of that you don't need, those sell for 2 gold or so, meaning you can make a whopping 50 gold from selling everything, which won't pay for anything. If it sounds dumb to you that's because it is.\n\nAnd if you die on a level you lose your entire equipped shots, meaning something you spent 300-500 gold to make is gone. The best part is, now that you have no money, and you've used all your good shots, and it costs money just to put shots together, you are super weak and do no damage at the next level, which just makes things worse for no reason. The funny part is, combining shots doesn't even make it stronger, it just adds effects. I had 6 things combined and it still took about 6-7 shots to kill 1 single guy, and there are like 4 per room, and 50 per level. Oh but you can level up, at about once every 2-3 levels. And you super boringly can put 4 total points in 5 categories such as damage, speed, fire rate, etc. There are no cool abilities or any excitement in leveling up. And seeing as you gain 1 point in a few stats, it makes almost no different from level to level. Then there's this moronic ammo. So lets say you spent 3 levels worth of dough, actually got good types of shots, spent good money combining them, and haven't died so you don't drop them all, that's all it takes right? Wrong. You actually have set ammo, which drains 2 ammo per shoot, and about 50 guys per level, and 10 shots per guy or so, you got it right, that means even for playing well you run out of all that money you spent on shots in ONE LEVEL or so. Yes there are a few ammo pickups but they add 10 ammo and you spent about 100 before you find each one. The system makes no sense and basically means you run out of the money that takes you foreever to make, no matter what you do. There are only a few shots, and you use the same ones every level. Super boring. Oh and don't let me forget the genious idea of mushrooms, which you spend money or keys on chest to get, and they either give OR take your stats away. And as everyone on the forums can agree on, its about 4-1 ratio in favor of those taking away your stats, so just a dumb idea, a waste of money, and almost no value to them as a mechanic as they are illogical. There just isn't really any fun reason to play the game. Super repetitive and boring, no spells, boring leveling, never make money, don't do any damage, everything is too expensive. So save yourself the trouble. 4.5/10.","June 12, 2015","false","5.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","2"

Here is why:\n\nPros:\n-Eyecandy if you are into flashy pixels\n-Some sort of progression, allthough barely relevant\n-Chill music\n-Relatively funny narator\n\nCons:\n\n-Short with no incentive to replay it.\n\n-As soon as you gather some money to combine powerups and figure out what you're doing, you are insanely OP and game provides zero challenge (In a regular playthrough without any farming, i shot Act 2 boss three times and it was dead before it even moved.\n\n-BIGGEST CHALLENGE INGAME: Find the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ color key. Since you need 3 RGB keys to progress through the level, and every square of the map has stationary lights that shine brighter than the keys themselves (also for example a red key can be placed under a red light, rustling your jimmies incognito), you are gonna move around as a snail after you killed every mob to find the damn missing keys, unless you were lucky enough to stumble on all three. This could be simply improved if keys would show on map, but right now they don't so it's a pain in the ♥♥♥. Typical stage scenario: Spend 3 minutes walking around as a bullet hell boss, spend 5 more minutes walking around gathering a key.\n\n-The latest update gave ammo drops. They said they may remove that, but at the moment it just removes the one thing that stopped me from going back to town or stop using the op bullets. Not to mention the bullets 'wallhack' and with pumped range you can clear 4 rooms without facing any enemies at all. Also the 'combine powerups, mix and match' is a big blabber as well. You are gonna throw in all of them times three anyway and say hello godmode.\n\nBottom line, game needs balance and vigor. If you are a stoner trying to chill going pew pew with pixels, go ahead. If you are looking for a nice crawler expecting another isaac or something, it ain't happening, but they are updating it frequently so this stands for the time being.","June 14, 2014","false","7.2"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","0"

All you have to do is just spend every skillpoint into damage and get spread shot, split shot and life steal, the other last 2 don't matter too much, ammo drops far too often and mushrooms (yes, mushrooms) boost you too much.\nOver 6000 possible combinations of your attack? Around 50 useful ones, yeah. That's pretty much it.\nOnly 1 save slot that gets deleted after you've beaten the game, that's just stupid.\nHaving a pretty high firing rate with spread shot and split shot makes the game terribly lag, too.\n\nIt's probably just me, but this game is for people who want to stop-by casually, who want to have fun for a few hours.

You know those games that aren't horrible enough to quit half way through, and you just feel like you need to finish it to get it over with? Pixel boy is that game. There is no challenge; as long as you keep enough money on you to repair armor you will never die. If you are the type of player who runs through rooms instead of clearing them one at a time, this game probably has a good pace for you, if you like it casual that is. I like to check every room and take it slow so-to-speak. but movement speed is a crawl even with speed modifiers and enemy attacks are even slower. Enemies are pretty standard Zelda clones. Predictable directional attacks and different speeds of melee attack\n\nArmor crafting is nothing special, type is based on the color you have the most of, there are no combinations beyond basic stats, for a roguelike this is disappointing, upgrading the tier only makes the basic stats more powerful. Weapon's don't "Craft" either, you can only add the listed effect to what you have already. don't expect spread shot and flaming pixels to give you a flame thrower or anything. At the end of the game you have easily 10-12 effects on one crafted powerup and you just face-roll over everything. You can only add one of each powerup to a crafted powerup. This is for balance but if the game was faster, and better such a craft would be right at home.\n\nGameplay from start to finish for me was 5 1/2 hours, the rest of my recorded time was me getting up for food and bathroom. I consider myself a gamer of medium skill, if you are good and run through rooms you can easily beat this game in an hour. if you like it room by room like me prepare for a game lasting you 3 1/2 hours.","October 31, 2014","false","6.7"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

The gameplay is basic top down action fare, the controls are fairly well implemented but the moment to moment gameplay of moving and shooting is simply not that satisfying. Bullets waft out of your character and slowly float towards their target, enemies wander around in basic patterns often getting stuck in doorways and getting obscured by the scenery.\n\nThe roguelike elements also fall short. Levels are randomly generated but in the most simplistic manner possible, essentially a grid of identical square rooms with the occasional corridor or removed walls. The enemies are picked from a pool at the start of the round, and while they are fairly varied there are never any great surprises. The customisation systems feel unecessarily micromanagey and don't afford any real variety. In short you aren't going to feel like you're getting much of a different experience when replaying the game, arguably the most important feature of roguelike games.\n\nGood points: the music is excellent, the narration is humorous and well voiced.","July 5, 2014","false","1.9"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","0"

My first major disappointment was in learning that the weapon customization system was built around consumable powerups with 250 shots each, this leads to a lot of time spend managing ammo and switching to the basic shot type, rather then getting to use the different weapons. Which is a shame because the variety of weapon types and combinations are interesting and fun, but the limited ammo means you never get to really explore all the different options.\n\nMy biggest issues with the game are the length and the difficulty. I beat the game on hardcore mode in about 3 hours, which felt like longer because the game really drags on. I felt little to no challenge after I was about 1/3 of the way through the game, and I only finished it because I felt like I had to. The game is composed of 4 acts of 4 levels each with a boss battle at the end of each act. There is no difference between any level, they are generated from a minimal set of rooms and populated with 4 randomly chosen monsters out of a fairly small set. The boss battles are a joke, the first boss is easy, but takes a long time to beat because of how under-powered you are at that point in the game, while the last 3 bosses can each be beaten in a matter of seconds.\n\nWith a little bit of reworking of the progression system, an actual sense of difficulty and some more variety the game could be fun but as it stands it is a fairly dull game with hints of potential for something more. As far as I can tell from the steam page the game is not in early access or anything and the last update by the developers was over 5 months ago, so I don't hold out hope that the game will get better.\n\nI bought pixel boy for about 10$ and I would say it was worth about 25% of that. I would only recommend pixel boy if you can put up with the issues described above and the game is on sale for at least 50% off.","November 22, 2014","false","4.7"," 1 of 13 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","13","0","0"

I can't remember when a purchase let me down as much as this one did.\nUgh. I grabbed Nuclear Throne instead which I contemplated from the beginning. But still, god damnit I'm disappointed as hell. How this game got a ton of positive reviews with 15-35h playtime is beyond me. If you want to know the negatives, post/ask away.","June 29, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 23 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","4","23","0","1"

All the amazing powerups you collected while going through the dungeons are ALL lost along with everything else in your inventory when you die. When I die, I just don't want to play anymore because all my powerups are gone. And death comes fairly easily, too, once you get to maybe level 4, and you have enemies just spraying bullets everywhere at you.","May 31, 2014","false","1.0"," 12 of 57 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","12","57","0","5"

For it's price, it's a great little game.\n\nWell, it's a weird one also.\n\nI don't know the guys who made this, but i think they're former atari programmers from the 80's who got stuck in a time bubble somewhere and decided the make a game after playing Isaac. Also, maybe they were drunk and/or high on shrooms.\n\nBut it's fun. and colorful. very colorful. and the soundtrack is really good, ambient at times, electro at others, it can feel out of tune with the game at first, but it starts growing on you after a while.\n\nall in all, i don't regret buying it.\n\nGo ahead and give it a chance ;)","June 3","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
