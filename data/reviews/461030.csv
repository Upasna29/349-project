The graphics are cute and not overdone. The quiet piano soundtrack lends an air of serenity about things which can be quite misleading as you fly into a rage after missing that just jump for the tenth time.","May 27","true","0.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","13","19","7","1"

I thought I was pretty good at eyeing straight lines but I guess not. My poor little player character has drifted off into space way too many times... RIP.\n\nEnjoying the game so far though. You can tell the game was originally made for iOS, but the music is very serene and the minimalistic style of the game is really nice to look at. I've only played a little bit so far, but it seems to be a pretty formulaic gameplay with a tiny bit of story that helps push the character along.\nWorth the play/price if you're looking for something that's simple and passes time.","May 29","true","0.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
