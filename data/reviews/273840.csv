Top 10 Reasons are; in no particular order.....\n1 - $45 AU gets you the full game with loads of content. No more to pay.\n2 -  Mods galore ! over 400 tracks , more than 120 car mods, and most are very high quality.\n3 - Frame rates are impresive. My R9 290x cards smash 200 + FPS with max everything and 28 cars on track.\n4 - FFB is easy to setup and feels great !\n5 - Day / night transition during race is posible and totaly cool.\n6 - Being an Australian the SuperV8's are the most fun i have had in my 25+ year Sim Racing Hobby. They are sensational cars to drive and GSCE have nailed it.Combined with the Historic V8 skin pack, racing Peter Brock, Allan Moffat, ♥♥♥♥ Johnson, Mark Skaife, Garth Tander, the kelly brothers, Craig McLouchlan, and even Neil Crompton , Just to mention a few,  around an excellent version of Bathurs was well worth the entry fee alone. Bloody sensational.\n7 - By Far the best AI in the business, once you find your skill  level. Close hard racing. Amazing.\n8 - The option for manual pit stops and strategies adds presure and excitment.\n9 - Constantly evolving. The next update due in the next month promises great things.\n10 - IMO, the most overall complete Sim as far as features go.\n\nThere is more but i drive faster than i type.","October 5, 2015","true","166.2"," 82 of 87 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","82","87","7","5"

I must say that at the moment this game is the best offline sim racer out there, but Assetto Corsa is getting better and better, but as I said in the moment it is the best. It is a must have for all the sim racers out there, and now that it is on Steam is much easier to stay updated and get all the cars and tracks that the developers release.\nThe physics is awesome, the graphics is awesome, 60fps.\nAnother great factor about this game is that the tracks are extremely good. I say that because my city's racetrack is in this game (Londrina), and i've been there countless times and it is exactly the same as it is on real life!!!!\nSo that is it, a very short review. And if you are a sim racer you MUST HAVE this game just like rFactor 1 and 2, Assetto Corsa, and iRacing.\nPS: the must have sim racers are (in my opinion) Assetto Corsa, Stock Car Extreme, rFactor 1 and 2 and iRacing.\nPS 2: as i said it is the best OFFLINE sim racer AT THE MOMENT, we all have to agree that the best ONLINE is iRacing.","February 11, 2015","true","11.9"," 93 of 104 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","93","104","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jarno_zurev/recommended/273840/","jarno_zurev","Paul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jarno_zurev/","280 products in account","tl,dr: SCE has tons of great content and compelling gameplay and is worth your time and money.\n\nWhen I first saw Stock Car Extreme on Steam, I thought it seemed like something that wouldn’t interest me. “Stock Cars” mostly means NASCAR in the US, and I don’t like that kind of racing. And “Extreme”? Huh?\nIt turns out the “Stock Car” comes from the Stock Car Brasil series which is similar to DTM. The “Extreme” is from Reiza’s (the developers) connection to “Cockpit Extreme Racing” which is a line of sim-racing cockpit products. I have forgiven the somewhat puzzling name.\n\nAfter reading some reviews and watching some YouTube videos, I tried the demo found on Reiza’s website (actually based on the 2012 version) and it clicked with me right away, so I uninstalled it and bought the game.\n\nSCE packs impressive content right there in the box. As of right now, there are 62 tracks included with the game. Most of these are located in South America or are historic versions of tracks from around the world. I think that is very cool. These are excellent circuits that are new to me, but aren’t contrived “fantasy” circuits. (Reiza knows how to make them look absolutely beautiful, too.)\n\nFor me personally, not seeing Spa, for example, is a little refreshing. I do really like that track, but seems that almost every racing game these days has the same core set of famous tracks while there is so much else to see. SCE supports tons of existing mods as well as SCE-specific mods, so you’re sure to find just about any track or car you like anyway.\n\nEven though SCE is named after the Stock Car Brasil series, it offers many other classes of cars ranging from 1976 F1 cars to the Metalmoro prototype to Karts to 2014 F1 cars and more. Each class feels so different from the next that you are offered a very broad range of driving experiences.\n\nScroll up and look at the list of DLC. Hint: it isn’t there. Reiza is continually updating the game and providing new content for free. New tracks and cars just show up in the game updates. For free.\n\nSCE has fantastic gameplay. Most sims these days have convincing vehicle physics and SCE is right up there with the best of them.\n• The engine, tires, and road sounds are all well done and sound great. Some of the metal-on-metal scraping sounds aren’t great, but everything else is really good.\n• The AI behave realistically and they make realistic mistakes, just like anyone. With the default and most appropriate aggression setting, they won’t crash into you like a dumb human, but will pass you when it’s proper to do so.\n• The force feedback effects are very good, but can be inadvertently ruined a little by the user if the controller settings are wrong outside of the game. There is a guide on the official Race Department forum for setting up your wheel. Once you have it set up properly, though, the FFB effects are as good as you’ll find anywhere.\n• There is a 24-hour cycle present in the game, so if you start an evening race (which looks fantastic), you may end up finishing in the dark.\n• The game modes are the usual simulation kinds of modes: there is Single Race, Testing, Championship, and of course Multiplayer. There are no “challenge” style events or modes. Just the kind of racing you might have in the real world.\n\nThe in-game options let you tweak all the things you’d expect, but if you dive into the various config files, you can really tweak everything to exactly what you want. For example, I have my track map going the full height of the monitor, but only within the leftmost 20% of the screen. I also have the sectors of the track on the map display in different colors.\nThere are many in-game options you can change while in the garage, without having to go back to the main menu like some other titles.\n\nSCE will likely work on whatever computer you happen to have. Because it utilizes the original rFactor engine (though you wouldn’t guess by looking), it is really light on system requirements. It’s almost guaranteed that anyone can get high framerates in SCE. It looks very good, but of course it doesn’t look as sugary-sweet-beautiful as Assetto Corsa or Project Cars, but sim racing is about more than just pretty pictures, isn’t it?\n\nOne drawback I could scratch up is that the interface in the menus looks dated and stretched by default. There is an easy to install mod (literally just replacing a folder) that makes the front-end much nicer and easier to navigate.\nAlso, it really works best with a wheel. You don’t need an expensive force-feedback setup, but a wheel (even non-FFB) will give you a better experience than a gamepad. When I first got SCE, I tried my Xbox360 controller and a Saitek P990 and never really got the settings dialled in very well like you might have in a Codemasters game.\nThe gamepads were just a little too twitchy, so I dug my 16-year-old Microsoft Sidewinder Wheel (non-FFB, 200-degree-rotation) out of the garage, and it was so good. I played SCE with that wheel for a couple of weeks before the game compelled me to buy my G27.\n\nStock Car Extreme is definitely worth buying whether you’re only interested in trying simulation racing or if you already have a collection of sim titles.","April 8, 2015","true","311.5"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","42","43","2","1"

I have been addicted to it ever since it was released a few years ago.\n\nEvery one of the various cars is a pleasure to drive. The closed cockpit of the V8 Stock cars is superb. Turn off all assists and the speed of the Formula V12 dares you to even blink, the Formula Extremes demand good throttle control in & out of turns, and in the words of James Hunt, you can go fast in the Formula Retro if you've got big balls.\n\nI've enjoyed race sims since Indy 500 by Papyrus in the '80's, but the greatest for me was Geoff Crammond's F1GP - it had all the rules, scoring, tyre strategies, and excellent AI. I waited for something that would finally match it, but each time a new game was released, there was always something letting it down.\n\nUntil now.\n\nStock Car extreme is based on the GMotor engine, i.e the same as rFactor, Race07, GTR and others, but it is without doubt a racing sim in it's own right.\nThe Reiza devs have got inside the original code and amended it here and there (and they are still working on this so further updates & enhancements are possible), and in my opinion, the car handling, track grip characteristics, sounds and Force Feedback are the best I have found in any race sim.\n\nYes, I know there are games with more 'state of the art' graphics, but that does not detract from the detail that has gone into each track and car in this sim, and the way Reiza have kept udpating the game and adding to the cars & tracks at no extra cost is an example to all software developers.\n\nThere's a wide selection of cars, from Brazilian touring, to Mini, to Formula cars of all eras, to karting. All of them have their own unique character, and they really convey the excitement and exhilaration of racing at high speed. When you're on the limit, trying to shave another hundredth off your lap time, if you should drop a wheel onto the grass and lose control, you might sometimes find yourself taking your hands off the wheel and bracing for the impact.\n\nThe game is also very moddable, so you can paint the cars, edit the drivers and teams, create your own custom championships, and use third party cars and tracks, and there are many of them available on the web.\n\nAll of this means I can build the championship of my choice, for the best offline racing currently available.\n\nIt does have it's weaknesses, the main one being the lack of awareness of blue flags by the AI, and to be fair, this is yet to be implemented efficiently in any other sim. This problem only becomes evident if you are into longer races, such as full distance F1 races, but with some clever tweaking of the driver talent files, power and braking spread of the cars, and the aggression levels, it is possible to have the leaders lapping the backmarkers without much delay, and achieve great offline AI behaviour.\n\nOthers will cite rF2 and Assetto Corsa as being more advanced, especially graphically, but for me they are still way short of being the complete package, and they just do not offer the true driving feel that I get from this sim.\n\nStock Car extreme is the sim that finally stands up to the Geoff Crammond series.","February 12, 2015","true","466.8"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","49","54","0","0"

The force feedback is sublime and the general physics of the cars is extremely well done.\nAI is another accomplishment, it genuinely feels like you’re racing against other people, which helps to provide some thrilling offline racing.

I tried rfactor 1 & 2 at first, and then Assetto Corsa. So I didn't have a lack of sims. It flew under my radar at first, but I kept hearing it's a really good sim so I went ahead and bought. Boy, what a great purchase.\n\nThe amount of content is amazing. Formula classic, based on turbo-era F1 cars, Formula Retro, based on 70s era F1 cars, Formula reiza for V8 formula 1 cars, stock cars, old stock cars, carts, and what have you. And the tracks were awesome and high quality too. I might not have known all these brazilian tracks, but they are fantastic. Plus, with the modding community, you have a huge amount of pre-existing mods for cars and tracks (also mods that can be converted from rfactor 1). On top of that, we've had a constant stream of content updates, completely free, adding even more cars and tracks (Current 2014 spec formula 1 cars, V12 formula 1 cars, formula vee, a friggin prototype (!) ). This astounding amount of content has not been matched anywhere in simracing, I believe. It's amazing. And the quality of amazing. I am yet to be disappointed in a car's quality. I really don't know how else to say this. The bang-for-buck ratio is 100000000:1.\n\nThe AI makes for perfect practice and great racing. I used it to get ready for online simracing. My first online race was in this game.\n\nThe online community is very much active, and the races are great. My greatest online racing moments were in this game.\n\nIf you are into simracing, and are wondering if this is a good purchase, or if it stacks up against rfactor 1/2 / Assetto Corsa, trust me, it is the best friggin purchase in the simracing world right now, in my opinion.\n\n10/10\n","February 12, 2015","true","317.3"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","0"

The cars feel so much better in GSCE than anything on the market.\n\nGraphics - 7/10 (this is something that isn't even noticable while driving - the graphics may be slightly dated but are still             very nice)\n\nFFB - 11/10  Nothing compares - not even close. This is the best ffb I have ever experienced. I can tell what the car is doing at all times. I have never felt this level of detail in any sim,\n\nAI - 10/10 Again the best I've seen. While having the ability to adjust the AI's skill and aggressiveness I have found them more than a pleasure to compete against at levels from 90 -105 (this is the only range I've used thus far). They act like real drivers not parading in a line riding a rail, not playing bumper cars or cutting the track. They are absolutely awsome.\n\nCar selection - 8/10 enough to keep you busy. May not be the biggest selection of cars but I have yet to race half of them. Can't get myself off the 2013-2014 stock cars .\n\nSound - 9/10 The sound of the cars is very immersive. Sounds like you are actually there.\n\nPhysics - 10/10 Everything feels dead on here. I'm no race car driver but I feel like one - that should count for something.\n\nMultiplayer - placeholder (I have yet to try this against real people yet - the Ai is keeping me company at the moment)\n\nTriple screen support - 8/10 I maybe wrong but I cannot find a way to adjust the bezel angle, but it still works great with triple monitors.\n\nThere are also tons of mods available for this title- tracks, cars and just about anything else you can think of. Everything you can use for RFactor is available here too.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nIf you're  like me and looked at this title on steam, debated on whether or not you needed another sim only to pass it by and visit it again later - then stop it. BUY the game already. There is no chance you will look back after you spent the first hour on it. Plus the Devs are about to add a whole bunch of new content including updating the graphic improving the already more than perfect FFB (not sure how it can be better, but looking forward to it), adding more cars, trucks, dirt tracks and more.\n\nJust buy the game","August 3, 2015","true","25.1"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

I wasnt massively into sim racing then, it was just something i'd occasionally do, and i bought a cheap wheel and pedal set. Main reason i bought Race07 was coz i was into the BTCC and the WTCC in Race were the same cars (not exactly the same, but similar performance though some cars were in the BTCC that were the same such as the BMW 320 si).\n\nA few years later i bought ETS2 and decided i wanted to play that properly with a proper good wheel so bought a G27, which was great. Not long before i bought this wheel i bought my second racing sim, Assetto Corsa but i was hardly playing it, mainly due to the steering rotation limit on the cheap wheel i had and i still wasnt into sim racing that much. It was the G27 that really got me into it then as i thought i'd try Race07 and AC with the new wheel and boy did i love it, the FFB and everything, felt great. So ever since i've been mostly just playing racing sims and went on to buy others such as GTR2, Raceroom Racing Experience, and iRacing which is subscription based.\n\nOne day i saw Stock Car Extreme, and by the sound of the name i thought it was some arcadey type play around game not worth a second look...but it was recommended to me in steam, so i gave it a look and saw so many positive reviews and i watched the videos and liked what i saw, couldnt believe it was a proper sim going by the name of it. So i ended up getting it and i can honestly say that despite the amount of different sims i have, i play this the most by far, in just offline racing as it is great. The physics, the FFB are spot on, despite the old graphics i've been loving it and i'm playing it the most despite paying a subscription for iRacing, along with the content on Raceroom.\nNow i said that touring cars such as the WTCC as what i like the most so i should really be playing Raceroom the most as that simulates them and has the official cars from 2013 (and now 2014) but theres just something about Stock Car Extreme that i love so much with just the physics and FFB and it has such a great range of different series including multiple types of karts and different eras of F1.\n\nI so highly recommend this game and hope everyone makes a contribution to Reiza studios' recent crowdfunding campaign. They deserve it with making such a great sim and adding so much content for free which for games like iRacing and Raceroom would cost you, per car and track, so buy this game you wont be disappointed and make a contribution so Reiza can push it beyond extreme whilst they work on their new sim, which i'm drooling over the thought of!\n10/10\n\nThe only negative which is a downer for me is the championship scoring isnt implemented correctly and seems to be bugged, but Reiza have said they'll rectify this, even though it has been a while now but hopefully soon they'll have a permanent fix for it.","July 3, 2015","true","110.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","2"

Here is where Stock Car Extreme comes in. The game simulates racing weekends with practice and qualyfying, full flag rules, night racing, standing or rolling starts, tyre and brake temperature, tyre wear, damage, preconfigured pit strategies, championships and decent AI or alternatively the ability to host servers and race online. In other words, it is a feature complete racing sim with the exception of weather simulation. Disclaimer: I have not played the new Steam version of this game that much since it came out only two days ago, but I have driven lots of races on the last version that was distributed directly through the developer. So my basis for this review will be the experiences I had in these last months plus the 2 hours wheel time on the Steam version.\n\nIn terms of content, it has about a dozen different cars that cover a wide variety of types of vehicle and all behave very differently on track. From karts, Formula 3 racecars, a Camaro streetcar, Minis, the name giving V8 stock cars to F1-alike cars from various decades (list is non-exhaustive) the variety is greater than the number of cars available suggests. The over twenty featured tracks are all made to a very high standard in terms of detail and, according to people who live near them, represent their real counterparts very accurately even though the developer did not employ laser scanning in the modeling process. Most of these tracks are located in Brazil and they include the full tracklist for the 2014 Brazil V8 stock car championship, but a few others are present too, like the Austrian GP track or the now demolished former Johannesburg GP course. Since the game is moddable, there are literally dozens of user-made add-on tracks to download though and almost every major circuit can be found on the net (Head to racedepartment.com or nogripracing if you want to have a starting point).\n\nThe physics in this game are very predictable and they are conveyed with intuitive Force Feedback. They are not forgiving, but every spin feels deserved and I can always tell what went wrong easily. Physics feel is difficult to describe with words, so I will make a comparison here. Stock Car Extreme combines the firm, defined edge of control I feel in  rFactor 2 with the progressive loss and gain of grip found in Assetto Corsa. The Force Feedback plays an important role in that, because it strikes a  balance between representing the steering feel in a real car and giving the player all the information a real driver would feel through the chassis of the car rather than the steering. You really should play this with a good Force Feedback wheel and pretty much every wheel out there is compatible with the game. Assists like ABS, TC or braking and steering assists are available as well.\n\nThe AI is decent (i.e. miles ahead of Assetto Corsa or the console games), but not perfect. They are generally able to provide entertaining racing provided the difficulty slider is in the right place (default is 95%, beginners should start lower than that though while pros can go above 105%), but they are often too timid when behind and hesitant to overtaket. On the bright side they crash you out very seldomly. Since most racing sims have terrible AI, this probably still the best AI to be found in a racing sim today (Update: Raceroom has decent AI now, probably on par with this one). The online experience is great once you join a dedicated community with a server, but the public lobby is often empty (that might change with the Steam release though). The netcode behaviour is very good if all players have a decent connection. No warping and smooth movement of the cars. Things will start getting dodgy and warping will occur when pings are over 300, but even then there seems to be some safety net in the collision detection that makes the hit detection very generous when high pings are involved.\n\nOn the graphics side of things this is clearly a DX9 game, but high quality models and textures along with HDR make the picture pleasing for the eye, miles ahead of last gen console graphics but not quite up there with newer titles like Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. If you want to get a good idea of how the graphics look I would recommend watching some videos on Youtube , or example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c50pk-TgzfQ because racing sims in particular often look differently in motion. The graphics are good enough to make me immersed in the racing and on the flip side the system requirements are moderate even for 60+ fps gaming. One area that often gets overlooked in games is the sounds and Stock Car Extreme gets the job done in this department very nicely. Engine sounds, especially in the V8 stock cars sound amazing in the cockpit and the open cockpit cars have wind sounds as well. Believable sounds for tyre squeal, bottoming out or running over kerbs make the package complete here. Only the exteriour sounds are a bit dull, but the interiour ones makes up for that.\n\nIf you are looking for a Forza/GT style game on PC, you might want to look at Assetto Corsa instead because of the better graphics and bigger car list even though it lacks some features. Stock Car Extreme is a racing simulation that has all the essential features needed to represent real racing. With the exception of rain, it can simulate everything happening on the track on a real race weekend on top of the actual driving itself. Top notch physics along with some of the best AI in the market (because most competitors have terrible AI) and everything needed to simulate a full racing weekend or even a full championship make this an ideal title for offline racing. It is also a good choice for racing with a community online because of the reliable netcode and the ability for race admins to take race control actions like kicking, moving grid positions etc. Stock Car Extreme is the most well rounded sim racing package on the market today.","February 13, 2015","true","188.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","2"

No  But as a Realistic Sim with Real and based on Real cars and championships it will keep you driving for many hours.

And often, people were talking about it with convictions.   I had enough with rF2 and then AC came out, spent some time with it, realized it wasn't really my cup of tea, so I'm back to rF2.  The gMotor engine sims are just the best.\n\nIt is only recently that I realized that game stockcar extreme is actually brazil's stockcar, which are more like touring cars than nascars.\n\nSo I bought the bundle.  And boy... I should have gotten this long before.\n\nYou have to know that game stockcar is using an heavily modded rFactor 1 engine.  And pushes it so far, that you'd almost think they are using the rFactor 2 engine.\n\nFor a long time, I believed ISI/Simbin were the best at making tracks, regarding accuracy, details, texturing, blending,  repetitions, etc.. they are certainly above Kunos... and I'm not talking about how they look in game, AC have a better graphic engine.\n\nBut after trying out GSCE, it's clear that Reiza is at the top.  I have yet to try out all tracks, but so far, might have tried 7-8, and they all look fantastic.  Tarmac textures are the best I've ever seen.  And this goes for pretty much everything.\n\nThe tracks themselves are super nice.  I would move to Brazil any day to be able to race these tracks as much as I would like to.  I'm a huge nordschleife fan, and I've raced this track for 3 years straight, and the tracks in there are very nice.  Why did I mentioned the nordschleife, not because GSCE have such a track, but I mean, the nordschleife is a nice flowing tracks, and most of those in GSCE are like this.  Very few tracks with tight hairpins, and lots of tracks with nice fast bends, plenty of challenging S, and all kind of long curves.\n\nThe track surface (road definition) is probably the best I've seen as well.  The tracks feels very alive.\n\nThe AI is what you would expect from a gmotor engine based game, excellent.  I have to train quite a bit on a given track in order to beat the AI at the default 95%.  They are certainly very challenging.\n\nFFB is awesome, and it's hard to say which I like best between rFactor 2 and GSCE.  That's much to say, since it's using an older engine.\n\nIf you buy the bundle and get the formula truck, then you can race racing semis on the same track selections.\n\nIf you like real simulators, then you are missing on much if you are passing on this.","May 6, 2015","true","8.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It's not uncommon to want to go "one more lap", and completely lose track of time. Mind you, I'm playing on a Thrustmaster T500RS steering wheel and pedal set, which gets me great force feedback.\n- Tracks are also plentiful, varied and well-made, plus it's not hard to find extra content (both tracks and vehicles) online. The out-of-the-box tracks are hard to beat for their quality, tho.\n- The graphics are functional and performance is great. While the game cannot compete on eye-candy with games based on newer engines, it's still being polished and upgraded (in fact, a graphical shader update is just around the corner).\n- While we're talking about updates, the team making the game is one of the most dedicated dev teams in activity, always listening to fan feedback and constantly adding more and more (and free!) content to the game.\n\nSo, yea, great game, great dev team, great price. Highly recommended!","March 6, 2015","true","21.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You'll have fun. Its not about stock cars: there's about 20 other types!! For multiplayer experiences, I can't really comment just yet as that has many other qualities to consider beyond the sim itself. So how does this sim stack up by itself?\n\nFirst, this sim's force feed back is very good (logitech G920 here) and a real factor into contributing to this being the most immersive experience of any sim I've played: you'll be sweating and busy as you'd be in a real race car. It's not a casual affair. Also if I compare this sim to Dirt Rally, Assetto Corsa, rFactor2, ... this one stands out in that it makes me smile (bit more on that later).\n\nWith the physics, everything seems to makes sense.. sliding off on dirtier parts of the track, lift off leading to spins.. bit by bit I found myself learning, adjusting and driving faster. It was a challenge to drive consistenly fast and crash free for 20-30 minutes, and so the feel of achievement is just great when crossing the finish line. Luckily this is not because the game is harsh or anything. That all combined with the competent AI is I think why overall experience of racing in this sim is so good.. and FUN really. I can't help but feel that a certain thing of Brazil is showing through .. a certain something that others just lack...\n\nAI - Good and certainly the most enjoyable I've experienced. The AI is cheecky and may nudge you, it jumps in gaps, it respects racing lines decently but also doesn't drone around in one long line up. Overtaking is very rewarding.\n\nGraphics - Less than for example Asseto Corsa but easily good enough to not break the spell. My GTX970 runs 3440x1440@60Hz pretty smoothly (Maxxed but 14 cars, x2 AA, shadows high, 4xAni).\n\nSound - Great. Just watch/listen to the videos! Works in 'hearing' the distance to others.\n\nRealism - Not a race driver, but weight transfer, weight, tweaks, grip all seem to be realistic.\n\nGameplay - Great fun. Find a car and track(s) that gels with you, tweak the AI to be a good challenge and start a 15 minute race. The rolling start works well. Default setups are very workable.\n\nContent - Most complete sim out of the box. Plus many community tracks / mods if you're looking for a track you may want that is not in the game. Wide range of cars and car types, many South American tracks and tracks you won't find in other sims.\n\nGUI - Slightly confusing at start, not perfect but easy to get around once you get used to it.\n\n\n**9.8/10** Highly Recommended for anyone that is not looking for an arcade 'sims'. Great value.","January 15","true","32.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Because it's a no-frills-attached racing sim dealing with some obscure cars and tracks, including the Brazilian Stock Car series (which is much closer to the Aussi V8 Supercar series then, say, NASCAR - No oval racing here), very good AI and the best track design you will find in a sim (even though 3/4th of the Sim's track line-up are tracks you have never heard from). Aside from that, Reiza studios (a team of rFactor modders who banded together to create their own title) often updates their products for free! The amount of content in this sim has doubled with no addittional cost. As such, it has the best post-release support for any game.\n\nIt also features gems like:\n1) An 'oval' track where people turn right!\n2) Just about any F1 car you can think off!\n3) A formula car you simply can't think off (powered by a VW beetle engine)!\n4) All the obscure Brazilian tracks!\n5) Excellent mod support!\n6) Brazilians!\n7) An 11hp rental kart!\n8) And much more!","February 23, 2015","true","95.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There's truly something for everybody here, from F1 cars to rental karts. And oh, those fantastic Formula Vees. The Formula Vee ALONE is enough to warrant the purchase of the sim. So much fun.\n\nAnd as if the huge amount of base content wasn't enough, the amount of free quality mods available is just staggering. Don't see your favorite track in the game yet? Chances are there's a great version of it available as a free mod. (And then you can drive that awesome Vee on it!) Work up a sweat, you will, racing the fantastic AI.\n\nMan, I love this sim so much. Had it for months before it made the transition to Steam.

I don't think so, but it can compete with it easily. The old engine simply cannot provide as detailed physics as the new upcoming sims, but it does the job - everything is there. There is no exaggerated oversteer that will make you struggle through corners, the grip levels feel just as they should, tires perform depending on their temperatures and wear, brakes too, the AI is nothing too special, but they are very raceable and challenging, even graphics-wise it manages to push out that last bit of juice out of that old technology.\n\nAs far as content goes, there's plenty, even though it could use a touring or GT class in there, it doesn't really matter. This game proves that every class is fun and playable if the physics are good enough.\nHowever, F1 and open wheeler fans in general should really have this game. There are FIVE (5) F1-like classes from different seasons and eras, plus the F3 and Formula Vee.\n\nAll in all, it's a really good all-round sim and it's not too expensive.","February 17, 2015","true","182.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Do you like how a racing game feels? If yes then yes! 100% Don't let its title fool you either, there are all sorts of cars not just "stock" cars.\n\nI CHALLENGE you to try the game and go to the slowest vehicle in the game. Turn off all the driving help/aids. Change vehicles by using the mouse on the left or right arrows on the main screen and Get into the direct drive (one gear only!) kart Kantan Kart 125cc and drive the great real Granja Viana track. Initially in the pits I didn't like the FFB, but put up with it until you hit the track. THEN experience learning how to steer with the wheel AND both your feet! Learn how to steer with your BRAKE and your THROTTLE!\n\nThe feeling in this game is EXCELLENT! The sounds are really good as well. Listen to the Aussie SuperV8s, sweet.\n\nSo again if you like the way a racing game FEELS you must give this a try. I believe you will be happy with your decision.\n\nNever heard of most of the tracks? Neither had I, almost all are good to drive. Anyway besides as others have eluded to, if this isn't enough there are heaps of excellent additional 3rd party tracks and cars based on rFactor (like the game itself).","November 29, 2015","true","79.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timitzers/recommended/273840/","timitzers","the.timitzers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timitzers/","11 products in account","A sim racing game about a race series that I never heard of. How well does this game turns out? It's fantastic.\n\nAs I said before, I never heard of the Stock Car Extreme (SCE), let alone the Brazilian Stock Car series. But don't let the title fool you - this game gives a plethora of race cars to choose from. I found this game through a sim racing youtuber, which praised this game quite a lot. I'm curious and decided to give it a go, and how! What a wonderful racing simulation game it is. Prior to this, I have only played old - but trusted - sim racing games such as GTR 2, rFactor (old one), Richard Burns Rally, and Race series from Simbin. I can say that this game belongs up there with the sim racing greats. Granted, I never really played any of the more modern sim racing titles such as iRacing, rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, or Project CARS, but I'm going to get there someday - and this game is the start. Hopefully they wouldn't disappoint me with their much higher price tag!\n\nWhat I can say from this game is it feels really immersive, at least with the cars I've tried. I currently only have driven the stock cars and several of the formula cars. My trustworthy Logitech Momo Racing still gives a very good force feedback, the sound of the cars are impressive, and the handling of the cars are very good - it's not overly hard to drive, but it is much harder to go fast. It's a bit forgiving, actually, but it's still a heck load of fun. The only down side is probably the graphics - it's definitely not as impressive as the previously stated titles, but I don't really care about the graphics anyway. I'm here for the handling physics, the racing - not for how beautiful the game looks. It's probably just me being biased for not having an impressive computer set up, though.\n\nOverall, this game is a blast - it's my first game here in Steam, and this game also introduced me to the online sim racing community in my country. Absolutely, positively, a highly recommended game for sim racers out there. Whether you just want to try out how it is to be a sim racer, or for the old time sim racer - this game is for you! I can't give it a higher score for what it did with the price. Thumbs up!","December 24, 2015","true","71.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At some time last year I got a cheap wheel that incresead my pleasure playing Race 07, and started to play Euro Truck Simulator 2 too. At this moment, I enjoyed this kind of game, but nothing so special.\n\nThings began to change when I got the Assetto Corsa in late 2014, and soon after when I bought a Logitech G27 steering wheel at the beginning of January. At that point, I started to really enjoy racing simulation games. How curious that I am, I started researching more about it in forums and sites related to this type of game, and youtube videos channels too, then I met the Game Stock Car, which always had great impressions, seemed like a good sim.\n\nThen I saw that the game Stock Car Extreme was to be released via Steam, and got the game so that was released. And since then, my experience and fun with this kind of game has been excellent. I'm not that experienced as a pilot, but the game has helped me a lot to improve, this is very positive for me.\n\nThings I think are very good in Stock Car Extreme:\n- It does not require many resources, works very well here with a Core 2 Duo 2.67GHz 4GB RAM and a GTX550Ti, all settings maxed running at 1920x1080.\n- Very good feeling of force feedback and physics. Although not an experienced driver, in this game I can feel a good feedback on the track and the car, I can feel how much more can I speed up and when to relieve the pedals. This has helped me a lot to get better.\n- The AI, for offline racing, excelent! As I play offline often trying to improve my skills, that's great! This is the best AI that I found (and a lot of reviews about this game confirm).\n- A wide variety of tracks and cars, including karts and historical categories of Formula 1.\n- Availability of many mods of tracks and cars, as the game is based on rfactor engine.\n\nBased on my researchs and self experience and other reviews, I think this is the best offline car racing simulator at this moment. It's a great sim.\nThe only negative at this moment is about multiplayer, few servers and little people online, but this tends to improve with the launch on Steam, at least that's what I hope :)\n\nThanks Reiza for this awesome sim!\n","February 21, 2015","true","111.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also if you have set your gears controls but auto shifting is still on, you have to turn this off in another menu!\n\nAlso pit limiter can sometimes throw you, you have to turn this off if you see you are not accelerating!\n\nMinor things but the gameplay is fantastic , runs smoothly and I highly recommend it","July 31, 2015","true","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The AI is one of the best I've ever seen and it is actually fun to play offline races with the AI, as they will be competetive and you can have some really good battles with them, unlike other games where they would back off or just leave tons of space once you're next to them. If you don't have a decent steering wheel, don't buy it. It isn't a game for keyboard or gamepads.","July 24, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hit the little arrow on the side until it says "all cars / all tracks" and then play whatever you like.\n\nI immediately hopped into a Formula Vee and was impressed at the driving experience. You *must* heel-toe downshift or else the clutch will drag and you spin. You *must* be progressive on the brakes or the wheels lock and you spin. I never thought I could have so much fun driving a sim (this is my first "real" driving sim). The sounds and graphics aren't nearly so old as people make them out to be.\n\nI'm playing with a Track IR 5 and Logitech G25 at 3440x1440 ultrawide and absolutely loving it. The next update will enhance the graphics shaders and add some new content as well. The community is super friendly and the devs are very helpful.\n\nIf you want to drive the latest unobtainable Ferrari via chase cam at the Nurburgring, look elsewhere. If you want to experience high fidelity sim driving, this is the absolute best bang for your buck.\n\nVideo review (includes mod support discussion and future release info): https://youtu.be/nZgXHEBLlnA","January 2","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is hands down one of the best driving simulations on Steam.  It's moddable, easy to play, and has great cars and series that come with the sim.  The controls, handling, design, and artwork are fantastic. The force feedback is spot on and Reiza is one of the best developers in the business.  They have never charged for DLC for this game and have given several cars and tracks free as part of updates.   Short of not being able to create custom championships, there's not much missing nor are there many bugs.  This is the game that Assetto Corsa and Project Cars wish they could grow up to be.  The AI is the best on Steam and the single player portions of the game are fun and very time consuming.  I normally play with a Logitech DFGT, but before I bought it, I played this game forever with an XBOX Controller.  It works just as well as the wheel.  This is well worth a purchase.  As a matter of fact, buy this game now and leave Project Cars and Assetto Corsa on your wishlist for a whlie longer.  If you tire of the in game content, there's a downloadable mod or track for just about any series or track thats out there.  An amazing experience.","June 28, 2015","true","24.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

These are the most dedicated and interactive developement team that truly cares about their productAND their customer. This team deserves much more success than they have and if more people who enjoy REAL sim racing bought from them, the big guys would be out of business. This is the kind of people who deserve support from the sim community and anyone else who is tired of buying crap and being told "it will get fixed in upcoming updates..." (looking at you SMS) and the updates dont come but DLC that you have to buy does. This game has been updated, fixed,and received new content ALL for free. And it is possibly the best racing game today, maybe not as pretty as some of the newer stuff, but way better physics and realism than any other that I have played recently.

It doesn't have the solid multiplayer of iRacing, the pretty graphics of Assetto Corsa and the UI can be a little confusing at times, but what it does have is lots of intensive single player racing against AI and a great car selection where every car feels completely different and unique.

The user interface is also pretty intuitive.\n\nThe tracks are challenging and varied, the cars look great, sound great and are challenging with no hint of arcadiness. I am a big R3E fan and while there are some minor nuances in the handling between the two, its easy to make the transition back and forth physics wise.
