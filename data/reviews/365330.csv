The most broken, frustrating, unsatisfying experience I have had in a LONG time.\n\nHorribly clunky unresponsive, glitchy movement. Luck based pointless spamfest "fighting". Absolutely no story to speak of whatsoever.\n\nAll you do is go through an ambiguously stereotypically asian city filled with spikes, rolling barrels that spawn literally out of thin air, bullets that literally spawn out of thin air, and ambiguously stereotypically asian enemies. You beat them all up in exactly the same fashion, none of them act differently other than slightly different barebones animations, even the "bosses" are exactly the same as the mooks, except with more health and a unique sprite.\nOnce you beat the last "boss" the game cuts to a black screen with "...a good workout" or something like that, and then your booted to the title screen.\n\nAlso did I mention that there is NO way of saving progress in any way. You quit? You start over. Your PC died suddenly? You start over.\n\nMany MANY times I have been killed because the game just did not read my inputs, or straight up did the wrong thing, resulting in my death, and sometimes the game just sends you flying upwards forever when you jump up a ledge (thankfully there is a reset checkpoint button), and the collision detection is extremely random, something that would normally kill me doesn't, and vice versa.\n\nThe last level (Level 5) is absolutely disgusting and highlights all of the game's problems I mentioned previously. As well as stupidly long rooms.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent at best. But writing this review after beating it, I don't remember any of it already.\n\nOverall I can't recommend this to anyone wanting to actually have fun. AVOID.","May 2, 2015","false","3.0"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","21","31","5","0"

Being discriminated against for his choice in clothing, you parkour your way through the city, battling stereotypically dressed Asian thugs, my favorite of which, is an 8-bit, half dressed, ♥♥♥♥ covered knock off of Liu Kang. As you mash away at the fight button, you pray you wont be defeated, since there is no indication as to when you may be bested. When not battling, you are avoiding spikes, and what look to be ethereal blades that spawn randomly (or are they bullets, no one knows.)\n\nThe controls are the most unresponsive I've ever encountered, which resulted in a lot of face first jumps into walls, followed by continual walking in the opposite direction.\n\nLaughed the whole time, thoroughly enjoyed it.

MORE PLEASE!!!\nWell, the thing is its too ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating. The enemies have no real rhyme or reason to their attack patterns, and there are spikes ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere. The game is a death trap and don’t blame your audience for not being hard core gamers that transcend the PC gaming master race/class. We tenacious types are hard to come by these days.\n\nthe best part is, the game actually has realistic controls and free running physics for the main character. The last game was better flowing with freeform puff jumping and more open environments to explore and enemy attack patterns that made sense, sure the combat got old, but the very first game was about the combat, second game wacko bananas ninja jumps, this one combines realistic jumps with fantasy spikes and trash cans and Chinese warriors from out of nowhere.\n\nThe death trap environments, along with the true-to-life(ish) actions of the character make platforming a pixel nightmare, and a real test of patience.\n\nI feel that the game could have had a better challenge curve, but i suppose its fine as is. all the same, don’t expect as many people to have the patience that i had.\n\nAlso, if anyone cares to notice, I’ve been referring to these games as a series, and that’s because I feel they may all be the same story\n\n*spoilers for Samurai_Jazz*\nIn the first 2 you're the same guy. At the end of 1 you get to (either) lay your masters soul to rest after he commits suicide at the beginning and (or) fight a dark reflection of yourself that stabs you in the back anyway, but that could have been all in your mind and it’s supposed to make you think of honor vs. all of the killing you did to get there...\n\n*spoilers for Shin Samurai Jazz*\nFlash forward a few years and you're (either) dead and (or) a ninja, and back in the city where your master died and there’s a gang of undead thugs still running the place. You fight the yakuza style 1920s/30s gangs and demons in the first game, now followed by 3 spirits. You take down the last gang the three spirits take over the world instead, and finally you conquer them in the name of humanity or something. The spirits basically loose all power and as a last hearty FU to the "Ronin", they cut the bleeding earth in half!\n\n*Spoilers for Jump Boxer*\nThe game starts and you look like some hobo that’s fighting at shadows. But after a few sections, I started passing by graffiti that was a tribute to the "Ronin".\nmy guess is, the earth got screwed, Ronin moved into a city where the earth was stable (or he managed to fix the earth somehow), he moved to china, and now as a senile old man, he free-runs around the inner city, and he's either shadow boxing his hallucinations or he's continually haunted by the spirits of dead warriors for being the one responsible for Japanese demons ♥♥♥♥ing up the earth... It’s not bad, but seriously, when the final boss looks like Bruce Lee, anything is possible\n","April 20","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Absolutely atrocious. One of the worst games I've ever played.\n\nThe platforming controls are stiff and basically broken. The wall jump is the worst I've ever seen, all jump arcs are fixed, you can't move to the side when jumping straight up. Sometimes you don't quite grab a ledge and cling to the wall instead, only to fall, presumably to your death. Spikes are instant death and reeeally shouldn't be, especially since there are a few occasions of basically impossible jumps being required (one at the end of a relatively long, boring level, too, you did not playtest this game, did you, dev?)\n\nThe combat is pointless. It's slow, can be won by spamming punches and holdind guard, and there's way too much of it. It destroys any chance of pacing this game could've had. All it does is waste my time between platforming sections. I think I died to enemies maybe twice in an hour of playing, and one of those was a boss.\n\nSo there is nothing salvageable here, nothing original, nothing worth your time or money. Avoid like the plague.","August 30, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game seems to emulate almost all negative aspects of old console games, fighting is bland, you can do a punch, a low kick or a high kick that do practically the same and no enemies require specific strategies. Movement is clunky and unresponsive but that almost feels like design choince.\nI honestly tried to give this game a fair chance, i gave up on third level where a fairly tricky timing based spike jumping section that started with a fist-sponge enemy, that i had to kill every time i failed, and i failed a lot because of the controls, that made is almost impossible to jump forwards from a standstill.\nThere is no plot that i saw, no feeling of acomplishment after beating 'bosees?' that were just enemies with more hp to make me try to play more.\nMaybe there is something I'm completely missing but the only positive thing is can say is that most of the pixel art is nice, but not amazing.

There are 5 levels and each one requires some pretty good platforming skills to get through them. The fighting in this game isn't really anything to praise. It has its punches and high and low kicks with blocking which the AI can be tricky to get past. You could try to be technical to beat enemies, but there really isn't anything stopping you from trying your luck with button mashing the attack button.\n\nThere aren't that many differences in the common enemy, but the bosses in each stage has some unique looks to them. While the fighting isn't really anything special, the real reason to play this game is for the platforming. The platforming parts require good precision with your button presses and good reaction times. Its got a good difficulty set so you you'll get kick out of this game. The game might be short, but for a buck(79 cents for me on sale) you get a great challenge  that gives you an old school like feel.","April 26, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Jumping puzzels are unforgiving and the game has a tendancy to jump straight up when you're trying to jump forward or fall while you're trying to double jump. Not sure if it's supposed to be high difficulty or if the code just needs to be tweaked a bit.\nFighting was a bit of a letdown. Like so many of the titles of the era it's trying to emulate, spamming low kick will beat most fights easily.\n\nBUT, hey it was fun for a little bit, the visuals were bright and had a "Jet set radio" feel to them. Characters had a little personality to them. I think I would have been diappointed had I paid $5, but for a buck?

Sin embargo el esquema planteado es algo complejo ya que tiene patadas y bloqueos  dando la idea de que pudo haber sido algo mas.  siguiendo con el tema, la gran y maravillosa inteligencia artificial que funciona cuando se le da la gana como vaca que va al matadero. bastante pasiva y poco inspirada por que cuando no es mr sensei de karate es mr de muay thai y si no es la señora de los tintos con la cual hay que pelear que acorralados en una esquina su paliza recibiran, a exepcion de lo jefes que tienen vestimentas diferentes pero pasivos como cacto en el desierto.\n\napesar de lo mencionado previamente el juego tiene sus momentos y es extremadamente barato, asi que pueden considerar esta como una recomendacion si la dificultad de super meat boy no los ha saceado y buscan algo en que pasar el tiempo y no han liberado su copia de batman de las masmorras de wb.\n\n","May 13, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
