This game is not worth your time, do not play it, do not buy it even if it's on sell for less than 50 cents. It plays and feels like a cheap cellphone game, or even an unfinished prototype. In fact I believe that the game IS unfinished, because the enemy AI is mostly non-existent, the level design is atrocious and the animation is the bare minimal, with some of the enemies having maybe 2 or 3 frames of movement. The game has a lot of bugs and is very glitchy, I ended up using glitches to my advantage just to beat the terribly unbalanced final boss fight due to the game being obviously incomplete. I literally just hid behind the final boss and spammed him with the strongest weapon until he was defeated, that's it, game over I won.\n\nThe game has a whole one song that plays 90% of the time, it's a very generic rock song and it's set on an infinite loop, there may be a song that plays during the boss battles, I just can't remember and it was probably just as unmemorable as the fights themselves. The only good thing I can say about the game is that the backgrounds are pretty good, they're very detailed and really fit the overall tone of the levels. Someone obviously put a lot of work into them and it's a shame they were wasted on this game, I really hope the artist(s) moved onto a project that's more worthy of their talent. It's a shame really, becauuse this game could have been rather good, but for whatever reason it seems that the developers completely abandoned it and the publisher released it anyway.\n\nOverall: The game took me about 4 hours to complete, that includes all attempts and when it lost my save data. It is not worth your time, the fact that it's normal price is $9.99 is laughable and I feel for those poor few who purchased the game at full price on a whim. So please heed my warning, back away and spend your money on something better.","December 26, 2013","false","4.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I also got stuck in a pit on the tutorial level, didn't feel like restarting. It reminds me of some old Amiga games. For 2.50 its an "ok" buy but thats if you have no other games on your wishlist list.","February 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This may look like some old-gen tribute game, but I've seen better animation done with play-doh. And gameplay.\n\nDo. Not. Buy.","January 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","1"
