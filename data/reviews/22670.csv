The intro and start-screen are pretty much the same but instead of green they used a orange/yellow theme. After a quick Google search i came to the conclusion that this part was released a little less than two month's after part 2.\n\nAs stated before the intro and start menu look exactly the same as part 2, after starting a new single player you get to see the re-cap of what happened. Again this looks actually like part 2, even the first minute was the same as the previous part. After the cut-scene you get to start and it again looks actually like A.B 2, i am not stating this is a good or bad thing but since i didn't like the previous part this just didn't work for me.\n\nLevel design is done with a great eye for details, allot of scenic sightseeing helps to enhance the orbital atmosphere. The in-game cut-scenes are i bit short in my opinion, since they look decent and some of the character designs are to be called quite unique i would like to see them for longer than 5 seconds... The HUD's change of colour works better since it's easy to see no matter whats in the background. The music is still pretty good but after playing five minutes i noticed that they cut the alien ambient sounds. Objectives in the main campaign are mainly going from A to B and activating a switch to proceed in the level and some backtracking.\n\nControls are still mainly for the twin-sticks and using a keyboard/mouse feels awkward and still has some issues with turning around to shoot an enemy that is hitting you in the back. The multiplayer/coop aspect and survivor-mode are still the same as part 2, the overall gameplay is nice but not my thing. Also instead of tuning the game after A.B 2 they kept everything the same, this could again be a good/bad thing but they could of optimize the keyboard controls.","April 19, 2015","true","27.2"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","2"

Walk an endless labyrinth of spaceship corridors to an electric door that needs a key-card then proceed to walk the entire length of said spaceship in search of said key-card. Rinse and repeat! To break up this frantic key-card search for every second door you encounter there will be some pesky aliens lying in wait to snack on your bones.\n\nHaving completed the third and final episode in the Alien Breed series I am still not entirely sure what Team 17 was trying to go for here. Sure Alien Breed back in the nineties may have been a resounding success but dragged kicking and screaming into the new century the game comes across as archaic. Clearly Team17 are still stuck somewhere in the nineties when it comes to the game design process. I remember the original being quite fun to play and rather action-packed but this entire reboot had me bored to tears for the most part.\n\nThere are absolutely no scares and the action is so flat that you would get more out of a text adventure from the eighties. Maybe Team17 were going more for the laughs this time around with all this nonsense key-card collecting. Considering that there is another infinitely superior title about a engineer on-board an alien infested spaceship called Dead Space you are better off taking your money there.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 15, 2014","false","5.9"," 49 of 79 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","49","79","0","1"

You maneuver through a series of 5 stages in each episode, collecting weapons and items, and shooting aliens as they appear while you move from objective to objective provided on your mini-map.\n\nIt is difficult to write a separate review for each Episode, as they all largely play the same - you move from point A to point B to pick up access code C to open door D to get to point E to get access code F to.....you get the picture. Lots of backtracking through same-looking corridors, fighting similar looking enemies which pop out of the floor and walls.\n\nIt's fun, but only moderately so - I would NOT recommend playing through a single episode in one sitting, let alone all three episodes. The gameplay is repetitive and it's the sort of thing you'll want to put down for a while between sessions (I'd actually say on the level of months between episodes) so it doesn't get stale.\n\nI will note that the third episode is easily the most difficult of the three, so if you're looking for a challenge, this one is probably the one to look at.","May 20, 2014","true","6.3"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","1"

Why it's not a great game:\n\n1: The biggest massive problem, CONSTANT AND NEVER ENDING FOCUS STEALING FROM START TO FINISH. Which really is not that prevalent in the first game but is a major problem in the second and third games. The game constantly, more than any game I have ever seen, even Resident Evil 6, steals focus from you during events to make the camera spin a little while zooming in and force you to watch the stupidest most mundane ♥♥♥♥ like a grate opening or a switch turning on or ANYTHING. It was like the developers found a little focus stealing trick and went way, way, way overboard with it. It is aggravating to astronomical levels and does not feel like you are playing a game but something where you get to play only sometimes when it lets you. Again, not so bad in game one but a massive problem in games two and three.\n2: CONSTANT screen shaking from explosions. It caused me to have to play each game from start to finish with a non-stop bad headache.\n3: The sound is very low. I have to turn my volume way way up when playing this game which is a big problem because of course I am not going to remember to turn it back down when I'm done playing so the next thing I do, like play music or play another much better game, blows my ♥♥♥♥ing ears off.\n4: There are very few types of enemies. I think 5 or less. And even those 5 all feel the same.\n5: The game is very, very repetitive. What you do in the first fifteen minutes is exactly what you do in every other minute of all three games. The game offers no variety at all, especially since all 3 games are mirror images of each other.\n6: The environments from the start to finish of all games is all exactly the same from game to game. Even though each game takes place in a different area of the ship or I think on different ships maybe, all three games are completely identical.\n7: All 3 games are very short, about 4 hours each.\n8: Crashes/glitches. I don't think I had any trouble with the first two games, maybe one or two crashes in the second game. The third game has crashed three times now. Once early, then half way through it, and now near the end. Their forum pin says it could be a file validation to fix it, but who cares when the games have the other bad problems I pointed out. And YES I understand it is a problem on my end. But no other games crash so it is a problem on my end caused by something to do exclusively with this game in particular and none of the other 150+ games I have installed.\n\nIt's sad because the games graphics are outstanding and the gameplay is very, very smooth. But because of the main flaws being so incredibly bad, I can only recommend them if you can catch them on sale like I did for $5.65 for all 3 games. Their normal price of $10 each is laughable. Like throw your head back and audibly laugh loud. Once I play through them I'm never coming back to them, ever.\n\nSince all 3 games are the exact same, only one score is needed. Production quality in some areas like graphics and control is 8/10, everything else 5/10. Overall, 5/10. Badly missed opportunity for a all-time favorite cult classic. Whoever made this is jarringly inept.","November 3, 2014","false","4.6"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","25","42","3","0"

I had fun all the way through. It doesn't do anything unique or ground breaking, but it's solid for what it is. The game has a good number of weapons, each good in different situations. Flame thrower is fun.\n\nI think one of my few complaints about this game series is a minor preference thing. There's 3 different upgrades for each weapon but you can only choose ONE.

I swear, the camera shakes all the time non-stop. Still, the levels are smart-structured and the weapons/weapons effects are very cool. The story begins to unfold here and it's quite interesting, so when the game ends, you fnd yourself wanting more because you really want to know what's next.\n\nAlien Breed: Assault - By far the worst of the three chapters imho, the levels are just huge for nothing, you always end up running in small hallways or from a room to another, in quick sequence. The secrets/logs aren't really that secret so the exploration part of the game is also limited compared to the previous chapter.\nTalking about difficulty and all, there's no reason not to play on Elite from the start, all you need to do is always have an automatic door between you and the enemies, since they will just stand there for a few seconds getting hit to death... or you can simply run past them. This is a huge problem shared in all the Alien Breed games, but in this chapter it's more of an issue because despite the levels being huge, you always end up running through small places (making your life easier or miserable depending of the situation).\nStory-wise you won't be that much satisfied but I guess they wanted to leave the better stuff for the final chapter.\n\nAlien Breed: Descend - Imho the best of three, even with all the flaws of the previous chapters, it has some increased pace that in gauntlet-games like these is a must-have.\nThe weapons at your disposal are better than the second chapter and more similar to the first. For the first time here, even tho the logs are still very easy to find, the secrets are not, you may have an easy time with one or two, but you're gonna experience hell to find a couple, and not always you can spend your time looking for them (there are a lot of events with a timer on, so no easy backtracking). The story kicks in to his final stages and before you realize you're on the last mission the games ends with a brutal end-game fight.\n\nNow, talking about stuff shared between the three games, I have to say I really hated the camera and overall the stiff controls, they could've done a better job, sometimes you're forced to proceed with a fixed camera and it's really annoying.\nThe story isn't that original but it's cool enough, it only lacks a couple of secondary characters, since you're always on your own or talking to MIA (the AI android) more or less.\n\nThe biggest blackdot in these games is the lack of Local Co-Op, it'd have been that much better with this option... also, if you're an achievement-hunter, you're gonna experience hell to do the last achievements in multiplayer, problem being there are not enough players online (or none at all) still playing this trilogy, so you will probably need to find someone on the forums and ask for help.\n\nAs I said previously, overall my vote is 6/10, I recommend you to buy the trilogy on a super special discount or in a bundle (better) like a I did, since imho they're not worthy the full price (or even half the price tbh).\n","December 27, 2014","true","5.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

But the end of the first chapter, the fact that you find Vance and Barnes, how to say it,... or Klein's body make the story good.\n\nIn other words, Descent is concluding the trilogy, still in the same ship as the previous game but with a reason for you to fight. Your friend MIA is prisoner. People around you are dead. No one is surviving apart you.\n\nThis game is very very similar to the two previous ones, so, well, I'll copy/paste parts of them.\n\nThe solo campaign is about the main character but you can play three co-op missions as Vance and Barnes with a friend.\n\nThe game is seen in 3D isometric, meaning that you have a little time to adapt to the command and the view when you're used to 3rd person or 1st person game.\n\nI've enjoyed this game but less than the others: the plot turned out to be very sad because his only friend is prisonner and Theo knows that if he wants to stop this madness, some sacrifices have to be made. However, given the fact that no novelty is there, apart another new weapon, this game is on the verge to be a boring one.\n\nYou still have the PDA - with finding those of the crew ship, without forgetting the maps and the terminals that are shops and save points.\n\nThe HUD is orange, like the title in the header. So, everything (texts on the screen) will be orange too. The game is also told with cutscenes drawed as comics. And well, orange is also the main color. Impact had blue, Assault had green, Descent will have orange, kinda indicating that we're going down into the fire.\n\nAlien Breed: Descent is still a nice game. Don't worry, it will conclude perfectly the trilogy. That was a nice ride, don't hesitate.","September 7, 2011","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the first one was slow, but interesting with a bland boss fight to top it all off, and the second one was a major waste of time with boring written all over it, the third is anything but.  Yes, the game still suffers from the same problems that it's predecessors had, but it is so much better in so many regards.\n\nLet's start with what was already good from the previous two titles: the graphics.  And boy are they in full swing on this title.  The game looks truly incredible for this game's budget and development level.  The aliens and environments are slicker than ever with almost no framerate issues throughout the entire game.  The environment, while still not as varied as the original game, still feels alive and vivid as you wander through the dark corridors of this forgotten ghost ship that is tearing through a planet's atmoshpere.  This awesome graphics level also applies to the game's weapons, which is by far the best weapon pool from the three games.\n\nSpeaking of the weapons, they finally nailed it with these.  The player still starts with the quintessential assault rifle and pistol (useless), and will still obtain the shotgun and flamethrower (still my favorite).  However, the developers threw out the worthless rocket launcher from the last title and left out (sadly) the hyper blaster as well.  Of course, the last one can be understood as it was pretty much a glorified assault rifle.  In the place of those two weapons you are given the Electro Link Gun (inaccurate but very, very powerful), and the almighty Project X, which functions like the rocket launcher without the incredibly annoying insta-gib if you're standing too close to it when it goes off.\n\nAs for plot development, there is quite a bit in this game.  It was great to finally see some character development in any form, which was completely absent in the last two titles.  A death near the beginning was touching, but very tragic.  And even later on, if you keep your eyes open, you'll run across two more deaths of people you once knew.  However, the shining star of this game is obviously Klein, the mad scientist behind all of this nightmare.  Klein's voice can be heard throughout almost the entire game as it taunts you consistently with your ineptitude, as well as trying to make you give up on your task of destroying him by tempting you with thoughts and opportunities of immortality.  Conrad, being the almost silent protagonist, quietly declines.\n\nMoving on to the enemies of the game, a few old problems start to rear their ugly heads.  Yes, there are quite a varied list of enemies to  vanquish in this title, but not enough variety to sustain another 5 hour trek.  Especially if you played the last two games as well.  There is one new type of enemy in this game though but it shows up rarely, and it's ripped apart just as easily from bullets that you're unlikely to realize it's even there in most fights (save it's shiny blue skin).  The boss fights, however are finally, FINALLY interesting in some degree.  Good lord does this franchise have some crappy boss encounters, but it looks like Team 17 saved all of the half decent ones for the finale.  Although to me, the final boss encounter was not nearly as satisfying as it should have been after trekking through all three games, and it wasn't even the best boss fight of the game.\n\nAnd lastly, a new problem arose a couple times throughout my playthrough.  Glitches.  There were a few areas where Conrad would seemingly get stuck for an unspecified amount of time, only to be knocked out of it randomly by an enemy.  Along with that, I even suffered a few game crashes while reading some of the logs in the game, which of course prompted me to stop reading any logs at all.  Even with these glitches though, this was still the best title in the trilogy by far.  If I have to take a few problems along the way to get the game to be this good, I'll take it.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10","December 8, 2014","true","4.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

To start with, this is Alien Breed 3. THREE. It's the THIRD game in the series, yet it uses the exact same engine as the first, as well as the exact same textures, exact same enemies (with a few additions), exact same guns (with 1 addition), exact same sounds, exact same level design, exact same atmosphere, exact same controls and gameplay mechanics, and exact same fetch quests. While the first one was mediocre, it's inexcusable that they didn't attempt to make ANY minor improvements by the third freakin' game.\n\nThe entirety of this game is fetch quests. Run here, activate door terminal, but oops power is out, run to power terminal, but oops there's flooding, run to flood control terminal, but oops it's blocked by fire, run to fire terminal, but oops it's blocked by debris. Run and find demolition charges, run back and blow up debris, run back and activate fire terminal, run back and activate flood control terminal, run back and activate power terminal, and finally run back and activate door terminal, all while fighting off tiny clusters of ridiculously weak enemies who serve only to nip at your heels while you try to complete objectives.\n\nIt is utterly ridiculous, entirely tedious, and completely predictable. Monsters pop out of the floor when you activate a terminal, search a container, or pick up an item (all which require you hold down a button for several seconds), but generally just one or two enemies appear at a time, which does not do anything other than require you to stop searching, kill them, and start searching again. Often multiple times.\n\nMonsters are insanely weak, and do not pose anything remotely resembling a challenge. You can complete literally the entire game other than boss fights with the ultra-accurate pistol, which naturally has unlimited ammo. The only time that there is even a hint of a challenge is when the game throws 30 enemies at you at a time from 3 different directions, but even then, it's not challenging so much as annoying. There is literally not a single enemy in the game that you can't kill with the pistol before they get to you, and that is just sad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/recommended/22670/","Brogbo","DrBrogbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brogbo/","1650 products in account","I think these games have actually gotten worse over the course of the series. To start with, this is Alien Breed 3. THREE. It's the THIRD game in the series, yet it uses the exact same engine as the first, as well as the exact same textures, exact same enemies (with a few additions), exact same guns (with 1 addition), exact same sounds, exact same level design, exact same atmosphere, exact same controls and gameplay mechanics, and exact same fetch quests. While the first one was mediocre, it's inexcusable that they didn't attempt to make ANY minor improvements by the third freakin' game.\n\nThe entirety of this game is fetch quests. Run here, activate door terminal, but oops power is out, run to power terminal, but oops there's flooding, run to flood control terminal, but oops it's blocked by fire, run to fire terminal, but oops it's blocked by debris. Run and find demolition charges, run back and blow up debris, run back and activate fire terminal, run back and activate flood control terminal, run back and activate power terminal, and finally run back and activate door terminal, all while fighting off tiny clusters of ridiculously weak enemies who serve only to nip at your heels while you try to complete objectives.\n\nIt is utterly ridiculous, entirely tedious, and completely predictable. Monsters pop out of the floor when you activate a terminal, search a container, or pick up an item (all which require you hold down a button for several seconds), but generally just one or two enemies appear at a time, which does not do anything other than require you to stop searching, kill them, and start searching again. Often multiple times.\n\nMonsters are insanely weak, and do not pose anything remotely resembling a challenge. You can complete literally the entire game other than boss fights with the ultra-accurate pistol, which naturally has unlimited ammo. The only time that there is even a hint of a challenge is when the game throws 30 enemies at you at a time from 3 different directions, but even then, it's not challenging so much as annoying. There is literally not a single enemy in the game that you can't kill with the pistol before they get to you, and that is just sad. Is the whole point of the enemies to make it take longer to get to the next boss battle or something?\n\nSpeaking of boss battles (and slight spoiler here), you are required to "kill" the alien queen 7 times.

The intro and start-screen are pretty much the same but instead of green they used a orange/yellow theme. After a quick Google search i came to the conclusion that this part was released a little less than two month's after part 2.\n\nFirst look into the game:\nAs stated before the intro and start menu look exactly the same as part 2, after starting a new single player you get to see the re-cap of what happened. Again this looks actually like part 2, even the first minute was the same as the previous part. After the cut-scene you get to start and it again looks actually like A.B 2, i am not stating this is a good or bad thing but since i didn't like the previous part this just didn't work for me.\n\nThe game:\nLevel design is done with a great eye for details, allot of scenic sightseeing helps to enhance the orbital atmosphere. The in-game cut-scenes are i bit short in my opinion, since they look decent and some of the character designs are to be called quite unique i would like to see them for longer than 5 seconds... The HUD's change of colour works better since it's easy to see no matter whats in the background. The music is still pretty good but after playing five minutes i noticed that they cut the alien ambient sounds. Objectives in the main campaign are mainly going from A to B and activating a switch to proceed in the level and some backtracking.\n\nVerdict:\nControls are still mainly for the twin-sticks and using a keyboard/mouse feels awkward and still has some issues with turning around to shoot an enemy that is hitting you in the back. The multiplayer/coop aspect and survivor-mode are still the same as part 2, the overall gameplay is nice but not my thing. Also instead of tuning the game after A.B 2 they kept everything the same, this could again be a good/bad thing but they could of optimize the keyboard controls.\n\nThis game gets a rating of 6,5, mainly because the game feels like a Déjà vu from the previous part.","December 19, 2012","true","0.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/recommended/22670/","zombkraken","THE KRAKEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombkraken/","453 products in account","I went into this thinking that I would have a separate section for each installment in this trilogy, but (after putting what I have deemed significant time into each of them) I have decided to lump them all in together as there wasn’t much difference between any of them. That being said, let’s get started shall we?\n\nI – Story [2/10]\n\nThe gist of the story is this: Conrad, the Chief Engineer of the Leopold, are trying to restore power to your ship whilst doing battle with hordes of aliens and contending with a possessed AI. And that, kids, is all she wrote. I realize this is a remake, but honestly? That’s all?\n\nII – UI [6/10]\n\nIn part one of the trilogy (Alien Breed: Impact) the UI (or User Interface for the less savvy among us) was colored blue and was infuriatingly hard to see at almost any given moment. Thankfully, in installments two and three, the color had been changed to green and was infinitely easier on the eyes. The mini-map was rather reliable, making it mostly unnecessary to consult the full map often. Apart from that, HUD was minimal and user friendly.\n\nIII – Gameplay [1/10]\n\nAltogether I found Alien Breed to be underwhelming practically at every turn. The game is played from a top-down angle with rigid and irritating camera controls. The objectives were mind-numbingly repetitive and I found myself getting overly bored about an hour into the first game. I present to you a dramatization of just about every thing you do in these games.\n\n“Turn on the cranky thing to put out the fires.”\n\n*Kills aliens*\n\n“Oh no, the cranky thing is broken. Go reboot six computers to fix the cranky thing.”\n\n*Kills aliens*\n\n“Good job on rebooting the computers. You can turn on the cranky thing now. Also, here are some more aliens for you to kill.”\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is quite seriously the entire game. Sure, you get an odd boss battle here and there, but I’ll be damned if they aren’t just as repetitive and underwhelming as the rest of the game. My other biggest complaint about all the games was the weapon upgrading system. This game is how far into the future and I can only have one upgrade installed on my weapon at a time? What kind of garbage is that?\n\nIV – Content [4/10]\n\nWith this being a trilogy, you’d assume they’d add some new content into each game right? Well, they did, but I had you going there didn’t I? Impact was easily the worst game in the trilogy. The campaign (in all three games, mind you) was downright awful. Part two (Alien Breed: Assault) added in a “Survival Mode” which was mildly entertaining. It was a billion times more fun than the campaign, that’s for sure. The enemies felt uninspired; most of them looked like the bugs from Starship Troopers only fatter and more ludicrous. The weapons were a bit boring as well, though I did particularly enjoy using the flamethrower. (Who doesn’t?)\n\nV – Visual [6/10]\n\nThere isn’t much to say here really. The graphics throughout the trilogy were consistently the same, with varying levels of obnoxious explosions everywhere. I realize the ship is crashing, but come on. That being said, the graphics weren’t too bad and the lighting was good.\n\nVI – Audio [4/10]\n\nI found the sound effects to be rather lacking. The guns weren’t thrilling in the least and the little, face-hugger-esque aliens, I would swear on my non-existant childrens’ graves’, were frog noises. Thank Cthulhu they got the explosion sounds down though. I can only assume that Michael Bay consulted with them on that.\n\nVII – Overall [3.9]\n\nIn closing, I’m glad I got this tripe from Humble Bundle and didn’t pay full price for it.","January 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now, I may be suffering from Stockholm syndrome from continuously playing all three games in a row, but I find this game more enjoyable than the other two. I may actually even have to recommend it ;__;\n\nThe opening did not give us much to go off on—a monotonous comic strip will NOT capture the audience’s attention, especially when you’re trying to explain what has happened from Alien Breed 2. That’s my only real issue with the beginning. It seems that Team 17 did try to make a difference with their game. They did stick to the run-to-here-and-back game mechanic through the entirety of the game, but they threw in many more dynamic scenes and gameplay experience as far as ways in which you shoot aliens. Now that they’re raising Klein as your main antagonist, I find it a lot more enjoyable, especially when listening to his stereotypical German accent. <3\n\nVery ‘OK’ boss battles. I actually kind of enjoyed fighting the aliens, especially in the water scenes (which I can also appreciate). They also brought in a new type of alien that while I like, I also dislike. I feel that the Electro-shocker is a bit overpowered, and would have worked better if it could not actively fight on land, since that was what I assumed from the first few that I had encountered. It would have made more sense, because the game shows that electricity will hurt you if it’s spread above water.\n\nAnd ooooh my god, the comic scene for the last chapter is so lovely. SO LOVELY. It’s just so sick and cruel and yet I can’t help but love Klein even more for being such an evil lunatic. I just LOVE it, even though I know I wouldn’t really enjoy his company in real life.  I did not enjoy the ending.\n\nTeam 17 made this trilogy with the interests of making money only, after seeing interest in their Worms series starting to dwindle. They made and released all three of these games in the same year. A LOT of content was reused in the first two games, but I also see a lot more introduced into this final game. I’m not sure what got them to put in more effort into this last one, but I can say that it is OK. Not BAD, per say, but OK.\n\nI’m not sure why this game got as much bad rep as the other two games, but I’d still say get this game when it’s discounted at least 75%, but if you were going to pick any of the three, play this one first.","November 25, 2013","false","7.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It is a bit shorter than the other two, and they switch up 2 weapons every game (game 2 was my fav with the minigun :D ). They did somehow make this game E VEN EASIER by doing a few different things.

"A nice casual top down shooter if you are into those. If you're not, you won't probably find anything enjoyable here, the game is basicly "Go there and activate this switch!", "Power down, go to the generator room and activate power" and the storyline is nothing more than the "usual alien infestation on your ship". It's a very simple game you might enjoy it or you might not. I personally don't recomend it." On the other hand I think the developers managed to get some sections where the camera is pretty weird and you can barely aim, if I said that that any of the previous two games were abit fun, this one certainly isn't although if you are into the story, like myself, this one provides an interesting ending. It might be worth the shot if you enjoyed the story on Impact and Assault, otherwise just skip it.","June 20, 2013","false","6.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Usually, when you can rotate the camera, the controls are here so you don't really think about it. In Alien Breed 3: Descent, the game always reminds you how bad they are.

The first two were solid, and in a way it was nice to get back to the swing of things.  The cool alien tactics, the lovingly detailed environments.  But after a while you realize this game is just more of the same.  The occasional new alien, but you can't even tell them from the old ones.  Your remaining nemesis, the computerized mind of an evil scientist, continuously taunts you from the sidelines with repetative (litterally repeating) dialogue.\n\nBut what really hurts it is that the screen shakes with explosions, continuously, for hours.  At first it kind of added tension to the game, this big action packed thing where the ship is crashing to the planet.  And just when I got sick of the constant explosions and shaking the ship made planetfall and I thought "Ah, nice timing designers, it'll stop just when I'm sick of it."  Except it doesn't stop, for some reason the ship just shakes constantly while it is lying there on the planet.  Did it land on a bouncy castle?  What the hell is going on with this ship?\n\nYou can't have tension unless you allow the plot moments to breath, and this game doesn't.  Even the pause screen is a mess of nausiating static.  My advice is to pick up the first one or two in the series, which are totally solid titles, and give this one a pass.","July 8, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I think it's not the best one, but not the worst. I would say they align like that (from best to worst):\n\nAlien Breed 1\nAlien Breed 3\nAlien Breed 2\n\nThe first part is far more superior. I don't know why. Maybe the game was still fresh by then and after the first part you basically did the same thing all over again in the next 2 parts.\n\nAnyway. It's a decent trilogy. Some people say that its repetitivness will make you bore of the game, but it's not entirely true. The action of these games are very fun. Fun to shoot the aliens that swarm at you from all directions. Even if you do this hundreds of times during the games.\n\nAs for Alien Breed 3\n\n+more aggressive aliens. They even seemed faster than in the previous parts.\n+boss fights. Even tho they are quite straight forward, but still good enough.\n\nand now annoying things\n\n-you will get stuck in some narrow corridors\n-there are so MANY explosions going on around you. One level was basically an explosion fiesta. And that's not the worst thing, but with every explosion your screen starts to shake and you can hardly see something. Imagine that it lasts for the whole level (~50 minutes). This is just stupidly ridiculous. Very frustrating. I know, the ship is in a bad shape and so on, but why make it shake every few seconds and make the things explode in the exactly same spots over and over again.\n-camera positioning still sucks sometimes (well, mostly when you can't rotate it)\n\nI got this game from the Humble Bundle a few years ago. If you really want to play this game, at least get it when it's on a sale. Otherwise it's not worth ~20€.\n","April 5","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A fitting end to this trio of games, with an increase in encounters and environmental shifts that reflect where the plot has taken things perfectly.\n\nShort-ish review since I mooned about the first two games plenty, but yeah. Get the trilogy. Play 'em all.","January 7","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Then gameplay is exactly what you would expect from the Alien Breed games, with the surroundings keeping true to the previous games style. My only gripe with the game is the ending, as I felt it was sudden and left quite a lot to be desired; almost made the entire series feel overly pointless; but you can be the judge for yourself as I still recommend playing.","January 15","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

And I think it's not the best one, but not the worst. I would say they align like that (from best to worst):\n\nAlien Breed 1\nAlien Breed 3\nAlien Breed 2\n\nThe first part is far more superior. I don't know why. Maybe the game was still fresh by then and after the first part you basically did the same thing all over again in the next 2 parts.\n\nAnyway. It's a decent trilogy. Some people say that its repetitivness will make you bore of the game, but it's not entirely true. The action of these games are very fun. Fun to shoot the aliens that swarm at you from all directions. Even if you do this hundreds of times during the games.\n\nAs for Alien Breed 3\n\n+more aggressive aliens. They even seemed faster than in the previous parts.\n+boss fights. Even tho they are quite straight forward, but still good enough.\n\nand now annoying things\n\n-you will get stuck in some narrow corridors\n-there are so MANY explosions going on around you. One level was basically an explosion fiesta. And that's not the worst thing, but with every explosion your screen starts to shake and you can hardly see something. Imagine that it lasts for the whole level (~50 minutes). This is just stupidly ridiculous. Very frustrating. I know, the ship is in a bad shape and so on, but why make it shake every few seconds and make the things explode in the exactly same spots over and over again.\n-camera positioning still sucks sometimes (well, mostly when you can't rotate it)\n\nI got this game from the Humble Bundle a few years ago. If you really want to play this game, at least get it when it's on a sale. Otherwise it's not worth ~20€.\n","April 5","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was a big fan of the original game and so when this new and updated version came out I was pretty excited. From what I can remember of the 90's game, this seems to be pretty faithful to the original. Pick up a gun, kill aliens. Admittedly some of the mission tasks can be pretty repetitive, and the story.. exists... but thats not what this game is about. With the unreal engine behind it I sometimes felt that this is what XCOM would be if it was just the combat in real time. In any case, I enjoyed myself with this one.\n8/10\n0 Comments","June 1","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
