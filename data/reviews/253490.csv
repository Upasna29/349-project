I spent as long as I could but unfortunately it was difficult for me to stay playing. I did come up with a small list for pros and cons and I apologize for not getting a better list:\n\nPros:\n\n- Decent music\n- Class variety\n- Cute female outfits\n- Unique weapons not usually seen in other mmos (Gladiator Chakra)\n- Easy to use combat system\n- Dated Graphics, not terrible but extremely dated. I got a PS1 feel from it. Lot of people probably wouldn't like it though\n- FPS, being an older game, I was hitting about 100 FPS, which is always nice in any game.\n\nCons:\n\n- Security Codes, if anything turns me off faster it's telling me I have to protect my account two and three times more with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\n- Bugs, specifically with the warehouse not working or loading and trying to chat with nothing I said showing up, which as a newbie made it super difficult to ask a question.\n\n- Clunky UI, couldn't really find everything I needed and most of the windows were almost too big.\n\n- Unclear Text, Had a lot of issues with the red text, mostly, it felt like there was almost too much and made it hard to identify why it was red. Some items were highlighted as not red, though my character still couldnt wear it, and the info never seemed to declare why.\n\n-Simplified Questing, In 2 hours of play, only one quest was a fetch quest, the others were nothing but hunt this and dungeon that or warp here.\n\n- Automated fighting, when I played as a Shielder, my skills worked automatically, I don't know how I got it to work but it made the game even harder to enjoy. Some might like that, but I didn't.\n\n- Objective KSing, Monsters can be kill stolen, making it super impossible to get certain quest done as any class that isn't a dps character such as the force shielder. For me, since it happened way too often, was really the first worst impression a game could give.\n\n\n\nI think I might have missed something but it's hard for me to remember atm. I might come back and edit more in, but I've already uninstalled the game. Don't bother wasting your time with this one, too much of a headache and hardly enjoyable unless you're a die-hard fan.\n\nEdit: I see that a lot of people are saying this review isn't helpful because either I have no answer for the loading issues or region locking, and I don't. Please don't take it out on me, take it to the dev's support page please. Link is here: https://www.estgames.com/CABAL/en/Support\n\nAlso, I apologize if you happen to be a die hard fan and I gave a bad review about your favorite mmo, I had never heard of this mmo prior to steam this week, and I didn't know what to expect, I had a good feeling at character select but for me I did at least expect a bit of uniqueness from the game and it let me down. Sorry that you expect me to love the game, I just couldn't.\n\nI'm trying to accept friendly comments, but a lot of what you people have to say has been telling me to kill myself or otherwise agreeing that I should. I've only asked that if you have an opinion that you keep it respectful, and people cannot even do that. Do not be surprised if your comment is deleted. I still hold the right to do so, if you cannot be mature about your post.","February 18","false","2.2"," 435 of 626 people (69%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","69","435","626","51","44"

But that can be fixed with network booster like wtfast or mudfish which will cost money\n- Not really Pay to win but sure is Pay to rush (if you don't play pvp/war, which isn't needed)\n- Overpriced cash items [the only thing worth buying is the $5 starter pack]\n- Limited cash shop costumes / accessory customization\n- Quests get boring real fast\n- If you still have enough patient to play until level 100, quests will get even more boring\n- +30% (or even half) of players are bots [who names their character VGPT2R ?]\n- BOTS everywhere, some advertising their website selling in game items or currency\n- Really buggy, esp dungeons\n- $8.49USD a month for premium [Gps warp, or else you have to waste time running around.]\n- Goddam premium man\n- Repetitive quests [fetch or kill monsters]\n- Limited character customization when creating character [6 faces, 8 hair styles and like 6 hair colors]\n- Dungeon entry costs force gems [Non-mission dungeons]\n- If you die, to respawn at the spot costs you 10 force gems, otherwise you can respawn at the warp and run back\n- Shtty community: You will see people wasting megaphone on server/channel's chat log arguing over pointless things everyday, Your kills/drops can be snatched, Non english speakers spamming in their language, PK in higher level maps (not against the game's rule, but annoying af especially when you have to do quest and some guy just keeps coming to kill you keeping you from doing your quests), but there are nice people who buffs others randomly.\n- 1280 resolution, may not considered a as con for an old game, but developers could've upgraded.\n\nFor me: meh 5/10\n\nI do warn you not to try spending money (on premium or upgrade) on this game, as I am certain  you will quit sooner or later at some point. So far I have spent 24USD and Im regretting it right now.\n\n\nEDIT: Im giving this game a neutral for now, I may find more flaws in this game the more I play.","March 26","true","401.3"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","32","34","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pedrofsky/recommended/253490/","pedrofsky","Thanks Obama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pedrofsky/","350 products in account","Note: This is a review of someone who has played the game back in 2008 for months, and decided to check the game out almost 10 years later on it's steam debut.\n\nCons:\n- Pay2Win. They literally sell gold (alz) in the cash shop, aswell as enchantments and pretty much every ingame item is buyable with real money.\n- High cash shop prices. Is this 2008? It's bad enough that it's a p2w game, but "premium" costs 13$! (same as WoW), costumes 23$. Yep, if you want to look like a cowboy or a schoolgirl that'll be 23$.\n- Very Grindy. Korean mmo. You like those "kill 290 monsters" quests? And grinding millions of monsters to get to max level? Well this is the perfect game for you. To give you an idea, to get a must-have character ability called "Battle Mode 3" you'll need to kill 290 monsters per quest, and you'll have to do it 30 times, that's 8700 monsters you have to kill to get the ability.\n-No hablo inglés. This is Cabal North America, but don't expect to see any american or english speakers. This community is made up of 90% brazilians and latinos who have no idea of how to speak english.\n-Bad Community. Besides the language, everyone seems to have almost 10 years of experience in the game, as well as playing in multiple servers at the same time. This wasn't that bad if they were helpful, but everyone has no patience and just wants to grind till max level and steal your drops.\n-Bad Support. There's only one person in charge of CABAL Steam forums, and he/she only gets around 5 threads per day asking for help, and they still get all unanswered. I've also had an issue for the past 2 weeks, which i contacted support with every information, pictures, and everything they could possibly need, and they didn't do anything.\n-Armor class. Every armor is class locked now. No more heavy bladers or heavy mages, you have to wear what's meant for your class now. This cuts alot of what you could do with stat customization.\n-Dungeons make no sense. To progress in a dungeon you have to do quests, and they consist of "Talk to this bookshelf" "Now go back and talk to this statue" "Now go and talk to a lamp".\n-Different client languages. They have an english and spanish client, which is awesome. The problem is that it is not client based, but server. This means that if someone links a [CRITICAL RING +2] in the chat with a spanish client you'll see [ANILLO DEL ATAQUE CRITICO +2] even if you're playing with the english client. Same thing for the class names, if someone posts something like "Need AA  for dungeon last spot!!", you have to guess that AA is "Arqueiro Arcano" which is Spanish for FA "Force Archer".\n\n\nPros:\n- No more 42 minutes maze dungeons in the story quests.\n- Quests now give skill exp, no need to leave your character in the training dummies.\n- Skills are grouped in "attack skill" now. No more Attack/magic separation, and grindind those 2 to transcender.\n- Good leveling up event. You get free premium, free boosters and free items. If you level at a good pace you have everything to enjoy all the good things that the game has to offer.\n-The graphics are still pretty. The skill effects are still up to the best in almost any mmo.\n-Combo mode. This game is known for the combo mode, and It's still fun and challenging as it was years ago.\n-Amazing soundtrack. It goes from chill music in the cities, to hard rock in action zones, it's awesome.\n-GM's appear quite often. They usually show up, announce "GM buff channel9 BI", and you go and get a buff that increases HP and attack for an hour.\n-PVP mmo. You can basically PK or PVP anywhere, which is something that every mmo lacks nowadays. It even has a nice nation system between player factions (Capella vs Procyon), and a channel that allows you to kill people literally anywhere, even in the cities.\n-Frequent Events. So far. since it launched on steam, there is always an event going on.\n\n\nI do not recommend this game. Although I have put lots of hours in it, I can assure you it's just nostalgia and the level up event. As soon as the free boosters and items run out, It will be the end for me.\nThe event will end on the 22nd of march, and if you didnt play and get to atleast level 150 by then, or if you're not thinking of spending hundreds of $ in Cabal, you'll be completely destroyed by the game.","March 10","false","237.8"," 42 of 55 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","42","55","4","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melwing/recommended/253490/","melwing","Melwing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melwing/","311 products in account","I played CABAL Online for about 3 months nonstop a couple of years ago. The only reason I stopped was I got back into WoW hardcore for a while. I kind of forgot about the game, so I'm excited to see it pop up on Steam.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kRbSm9IF_hE\n\nCABAL is not a new game, and you can definitely tell that right off the bat. But it doesn't play badly like some older MMOs do. You just have to deal with some kind of ugly outdated quest texts/fonts and some iffy (yet readable) translations. You can click to move if you want, or use WASD (or reassign keys to whatever you want). I don't care for the camera very much, honestly.\n\nThe combat is pretty fun and low stress. The classes are about what you'd expect, your general MMO variety. They do play quite differently from eachother though- very unique. It's essentially a themepark with some neat mechanics. PVP is fun, but very DPS-focused (tanks and healers don't really play much of a role). Music is really weird for the genre, but it's pretty good. (It's like weird hard rock)\n\nThere is a cash shop and premium and whatnot, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's p2w. It's DEFINITELY pay-to-advance-way-faster, though. but I think you can have a good time with CABAL for free.","February 17","true","1.1"," 96 of 153 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","96","153","7","5"

I'm from Romania and I'm playing with 400 ms but it's alright.\nNow, old players or people who played CABAL before know how the game is, it's features, etc. If you're a returning player and you're thinking of giving this server a try, do so! You get premium for a month and tons of other benefits right now. The economy is new, the server is populated and everyone's still mid to high level. Worth playing.\nIf you're new to the game and have no idea what the hell this is, here's a quick summary. This is a somewhat fast paced MMORPG that's been on the market for almost 10 years now and it's still awesome. In a way.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fast paced combat with unique systems such as the combo system which is very entertaining\n-  Awesome music\n- Graphics? This could be counted as a good thing since that means this will work on older system as well.\n- Flashy skills\n- Tons of levels\n\nCons:\n\n- It's Pay2Win - Yeah it is, you can literally buy Alz from the Item Shop. It's not entirely game breaking since you can.. well, I dunno, it would take a ton of time to get a top kek gear set without spending any real cash but still, it's possible.\n- Lags if you're not from NA which I believe is something they should add on the main page instead of the forum but oh well, I don't really complain about it. It's playable for me\n- A few bugs here and there. It's not a very fluid game, you'll sometimes get stuck in invisible rocks and stuff like that.\n- It's very grindy and repetitive - You'll grind a lot in this game. Levels? Grind. Dungeons? Grind. After a while it actually gets boring and well, yeah.\n- Small maps - Compared to other MMORPGs such as WoW, GW2, Silkroad Online, PWI and other older and newer games, this one has a very small map. I mean, the Elwynn forest and Stormwind map in WoW make up the whole map in CABAL.\n\nI guess that's all I can come up with at this time.\nI love this game, it's my second MMMORPG I ever played and it's normal that I'd be so inclined to give this one a positive review.\nAlso, take note that this is my personal opinion about the game.\nOverall, I recommend you give this game a try it least if you're unsure. It's 2 GB only and you don't have anything to lose :)","February 24","true","50.7"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","28","38","5","0"

Having played this game around 2008/2009, I am glad to see not much has changed - that counts for the bad and good parts though.\n\nEssentially, Cabal Online is a game that is very addicting - it is like Diablo or any Lootathon, except that instead of Loot, you are hunting levels. The game is unique in that your EXP and Skill-EXP are separate - using skills and completing some quests fills up your Skill-EXP, and completing quests and killing monsters your normal EXP. Here is a big bad part of the game though - while leveling up is always fun, later skill levels just take way too long to level up and advance. However, it does have an addicting feeling to it, simply because you know that on the next skill level you get even better looking and more powerful skills.\n\nI always enjoyed Cabal especially because of the Skill system - powerful Auras, Battle Stances and Skills look great and feel good. The game does have an outdated look, but is still okay to look at - and it just has this unique sense of fun when playing it.

You may disapporove graphics first but while you build your character you will slowly fall in love with it, game has unique armor and weapon design. Whole game is unique. And even though it is quite populer, I think it's one of the most underrated mmorpgs ever.\n\nMost of the negative comments based on connection problems. There is serious ping issue.

(mercury server). im also not new player just a new starter on steam version.\n\n\nPRO: you start with a great premium bonus in this steam version. i dont know how long it runs i guess 7 days but i might be wrong. there is nothing to review when it run out.\n\nCONTRA:\n\nyou get spammed by bots who make you money offers faster than you can block them. they recreate themselves. i blocked one, turned around to move on and got exact the same message by some other new one. IT NERVS.\n\nthere is no communication in public chat. you cant ask for help, you get no answers and if you catch someone writing in there so its every language but not english. (most time spanish)\n\n90% of all players got names like vk2764016407jbjhbe21ez21ge8z7, i never knew if i was facing a player or another bot. in my opinion its very ugly to be surrounded by such names. it nerved me so hard that this was the main reason for deleting this steam version.\n\nas new user you dont get your crappy stuff sold. items who come by 0 alz in worth are made to sell them in auction. but nobody wants to buy your crappy stuff. they all got better. you stand around for hours and nothing happens. you wasted time and the money you could have got by selling it in auction. it make me very depressed to run around to loot creatures and actually catch good stuff but have no way to sell it than stand useless around for hours and nothing happened afterwards.\n\nmissing conversation (no one talk, nobody answer you are alone while playing with hundreds)\n\nfor my opinion to easy uplevel action in the first level.\n\nthe high selling prices of ingame items (44.000.000 to 1.000.000.000 alz or more) is waaaaaay to heavy in here for me. indeed between serious players stand BOTS who are trying to sell you 3 return-stones for 44.000.000 alz or more. joke of the centuary. watch the price at the grocer shop. you will die laughing.\n\n- FOR ME the original version is one of the best online games ever. old but never rusted. its always fun to grind around the map and slaught some creatures.\n\nsteam version killed itself by being so infected by these seller bots or player bots and people with names like ve802e081782ze02ze702ze078. :( i deinstalled and start over in my more pretty original again. just make your own opinion.","April 16","false","23.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Nothing else.\nSure there might be a few things you need to know, like tips and tricks for the dungeons, which some might need practice for, but in the end, gear will dictate wether you can do anything at all. Both in PvE and PvP. Especially in PvP.\nThe second, is that if you're rich, you can pretty much buy all your equipment. By buying game store gear with real life money and selling the stuff on the auction house, you can pretty much make a ton of money and buy almost anything you need. I even shamelessly admit I did it myself, because...\n\nProblem No.3, and personaly the biggest problem with it, the game is a severe grindfest based PURELY on luck.\nRemember how I said PvP is very based in gear? Critical hits are dictated by critical hit ratio, and if you have none, you're screwed, and if you have the average (between 45 and 51%) it will pretty much be a "if you crit, you win" situation, which sometimes comes in bags of 9 out of 10, or 2 out of 10. Same goes for enchanting armor, where you'll spend BILLIONS of ingame money to upgrade something ONCE if you're really unlucky, and the same also applies to drops, where you're either lucky enough to enter a dungeon and get a good piece of gear that you can sell (don't fool yourself into thinking you'll easily find good stuff you can wear) or unlucky enough to do the same dungeon 1000 times and never get anything good whatsoever. I've seen it happen, and funny enough, the game has titles for people who go into dungeons that many times.\nThere are also botters, hackers, and gold sellers ingame as usual.\n\nThe conclusion?\nDespite a fun little game, its chalk full of problems. You CAN have some fun in it, but after a while, it will most likely get on your nerves.","March 6","false","0.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It's quest heavy and requires grinding but thats what I think makes it so great. There's so much variety. When you're grinding, you can get unique armor or weapons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/virpyre/recommended/253490/","virpyre","virpyre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/virpyre/","224 products in account","It's still a grind fest game, even after 7 years  I played for an hour and a half trying not to fall asleep at my keyboard.\n\nPros\nSimple leveling system: Quests are pretty much everywhere from lvl 1 to like lvl 90+. Even if you finish all the quests your level, you only need to grind a little bit to reach the next level because the quests give plenty of exp.\n\nSkill Combos: All you have to do is put your skills on the skill bar, then the game takes care of the rest.\n\nDiverse weapons and armor: There are 3 types of armors, Martial, Armor, and Battle. Martial has highest defense rating/evasion, Armor has highest defense, and Battle is right in between. The look of the armors change drastically as you progress through each set.\n\nCons\nSkill Grinding: This is the most daunting task. In Cabal, ranking up in skills give you stat boosts as well as hp/mp boosts. And each rank-up stacks, meaning you gain more boosts as you rank up higher and higher. Which also means, in pvp and dungeons, if you do not have high skill ranks, you will get owned big time. I've heard of lvl 90 characters with master skill ranks get owned by a lvl 60 with transcender skill ranks.\n\nDrop rates: The drop rates have been drastically reduced. This discouraged many players from playing beyond a certain level, hence why so many players quit. The decrease in drop rate only starts to really get noticeable after you reach 70-80 levels. I have heard countless people complain back when I used to play  non-stop, and I believe the original Cabal (korean) company made this decision.\n\nBots/Gold Sellers/Spammers: Now this is one hell of a major problem in Cabal. There are characters selling gold for real money, bots mindlessly killing mobs in a certain area, and spammers looking to power level people for real money.\n\nCrazy Priced Cash Items:  If you saw the prices on the eCoins and cash shop items, you would have had quite a shock. To receive a 30-day premium, you need to pay roughly $18-20. Now what would you prefer? pay $5 bucks or so extra to play a game where the staff/admins barely even put up an effort to improve their merchandise.","February 22","false","1.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashleykilljoy/recommended/253490/","ashleykilljoy","Lucasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashleykilljoy/","138 products in account","First, it's important to note that the only reason why this game is getting "mixed" reviews is because the majority of those writing a review here are only playing the game for an hour before doing so. An hour of game play as a completely new player of the game will get you as far as 10-15 levels. The majority of the game caters to those above level 120 and the reason for that is because the game has been running for years now.\n\nLevels 1-100 have a storyline they can follow to quickly gain levels and progress. Everyone else is at "end game" and from there can only keep playing to run dungeons (there are tons of them!), go to war (3-4 wars per day), and improve on their gear. It takes maybe 3 days of full dedication to the game to get to level 100 and you typically do not require assistance from other people to get that far.\n\nYou can talk in chat once you hit level 10, I do believe (it's been a LONG time since I started a new character), so until then you are on your own, but the direction given to you is extremely easy to follow. Most of your 1-10 quests are "go to this person and do this to learn the game mechanics."\n\nYes, you have to share kills. There will be times where you will be asked to kill a specific creature and there may only be ONE of that creature that 10 people are trying to get to. The up side is that respawn times are EXTREMELY fast. It's nothing like WoW or even Cabal 2 where respawning takes a full minute or more. These creatures respawn within seconds of dying. This can pose a problem if you're in a hostile area and are being beat up on, but in general it's fantastic for fast leveling while grinding and getting what you need when there are 10 other people on the same quest as you. As you progress through levels, this becomes even less of an issue, unless you're trying to kill map bosses. The higher level maps each have several bosses that drop epic items for your character. Many players hunt these bosses for those drops, so they're much harder to find and respawn time is much longer. I think most of them are about an hour long, making them that much more important to hunt and kill when you have the chance, if you have the strength to do it.\n\nI won't get into the actual story of the game, but I will point out a few pros and cons of the game, as a player since 2008.\n\n\n\nPROS (just to name a few of the many):\n\n--- A step-by-step storyline that is easy to follow.\n--- Individual maps instead of open world design that allows for fast and easy traveling (no loading screens.) These also accomodate skill level, so you'll never be caught in an area that is unreasonably too strong for your character to handle.\n--- Easy-to-master combat system. It's more automatic than anything, because each move is a 1 button press, but there is some skill involved in how you level each skill you have and what order you use them to deal maximum damage.\n--- Skill variety, including everything from DPS, stun locking, PvP mastery, and buffs.\n--- Class variety\n--- Constant gear updates\n--- Constant dungeon updates\n--- Tons of friendly guilds and dedicated players, always willing to help those in need\n--- Tons of customization options including costumes, face/hair change kits, pets, vehicles, weapon skins, etc.\n--- UI customization, from fonts (face and size) to sizes of most of your info/chat bubbles, etc.\n--- Massive high level tier player base, which allows for tons of assistance and fun once your story ends\n--- Constant developement of game mechanics from the GMs. The game is updated frequently and often gets new content and bug fixes.\n--- Security codes for extra protection that can be applied to your warehouse, your gear, and your account in general. EXTREMELY worth it to protect your account, however. If a password, a sub-password, and a sub-password for your gear and warehouse aren't enough to protect your items and your account, then you're doing something wrong. Not the game.\n\n\nCONS (most of them!):\n\n--- Security codes. They can get annoying.\n--- Difficult leveling for higher tiers. Once your storyline ends around level 100-110, you're pretty much on your own until level 140-150 when the better dungeons become available to you. Map grinding is your best bet for leveling, or gathering friends to enter dungeons until you can solo them yourself. MOST of the dungeons CAN be solo'd by the majority of players once reaching a certain point, so don't feel like you will always need friends to complete dungeons.\n--- Grinding in general. Sorry, this IS a grinder game for the majority. The higher tiers grind less and dungeon a LOT more, but grinding is still necessary for gaining levels. And the 190-200 grind takes FOREVER. But that's end game, so good luck.\n--- Chunky UI for some, depending mostly on your resolution. (Mostly cannot be adjusted at all, so that's why it's a huge con) Mine is about mid-sized. I haven't figured out how to make it any smaller, but it doesn't get in the way of anything for me, so this isn't an issue. Others, I've seen their UI take up most of their screen.\n--- ALZ SELLERS! They're annoying, they're everywhere. All you can do is click on them and block them. It takes all of 3 seconds to do, but it's still annoying as hell, because they do spam the chat if you don't get rid of them quickly. Nothing can be done about this, however. They frequently get banned, so you'll never find more than one or two of them in town, but that's an MMO for ya.\n\n\nIMPORTANT CON:\n\nThis game is PAY-TO-WIN. Though you can get by with luck and dungeon runs for epic gear, the really serious players who play this game to BE serious and not just to kill time will PAY for ecoins and BUY tons of stuff to enhance their game play. I've done it as well. It IS possible to farm like mad and make bank alz in game, but the likelihood of you getting as good as the people who play day in and day out and go to Cabal conventions and stuff like that is highly unlikely unless you play like they do.\n\n\nIMPORTANT PRO:\n\nThe GOOD NEWS IS that paying is not required, nor is it necessary to enjoy the game. There are fewer people who go extreme and pay-to-win than there are people who generally just play the game, which means that in most situations, you will NOT be outmatched by random players. You will hear about the greats of the game, like Super and Manbear and yada yada, but (from experience!) these people are nice and it's HIGHLY unlikely that a super serious pay-to-win Cabalster is going to randomly ruin your day. They're more likely to HELP you, not ruin your gameplay experience.","February 24","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to pay a large sum of cash to a particular instructor to temporary learn the ability to convert Sword exp to Magic exp.  The only way to evenly level them is to literally punch enemies for HOURS. Your spells are not restricted to your level like most mmorpg, you can be very VERY low leveled and have punch your way to access the highest spell possible (to those who play WoW, this is Cabal version of a Twink) and absolutely annihilate people in duels.\n\n\nPro :\n-Flashiest and most unique skills in all MMORPG I've ever played\n-Most unique class variant\n-Easy to learn rotation to maximize DPS/survivalbility\n-Forum is rich with topics to help you learn your class. Knowledge is power.\n-The most beautiful design of swords and armor. (For the lads, most steamiest armors for female characters)\n\n\nSubjective (some people have zero problem with this compared to me) :\n-Traveling to dungeons is somewhat off putting due to the distance (unless you have a hoverboard /bike )\n-Limited bag space unless premium player (Think Diablo 2 /Path Of Exile level of bag space)\n-Your skill =/= your level, you do not gain new spells base on level , but base on proficient . You will definitely be leaving your character AFK-ing at the Training Dummy to gain the SKILL exp to be able to learn the new spell (Think of it as Ragnarok 1 ,where you have a Base Level and Job Level). This really isn’t a problem unless you are concern about your PC/Laptop overheating if you log in to park your character at the training dummy to go out to do something.\n-Certain class may seem over/underpowered at certain level bracket but they all simmer down to being "Eh"\n-Winning the Nation War does actually matter to an extend. When the faction you choose wins the War, premium players are granted access to warp points shortcuts which lets them transverse to dungeon much quicker and faster.\n-One particular class, the Force Shielder, is very versatile. You can be the standard DPSer (add more str), A tank (Add more dex) or a Magic user! (add more Int)\n\n\n\nCon :\n-When you reach roughly lvl 50 (I think) you are somewhat forced to choose a Faction (Alliance vs Horde, Exile vs Dominion yada yada yada) If you maintain neutral, both factions will be able to attack you. It will almost always be a 3 faction combat. (Your chosen Faction) vs (Enemy faction + Neutral Faction) . When you reach that point in the game, it's all open PVP from here (as far as I know). Certain dungeons are located in said dangerous zone,so be prepared to be ganked from the bushes when you are on your way.\n-Pay2SaveTime but not Pay2Win much. The Cash Shop (Microtransaction) lets you buy the materials that you need to upgrade your gears with, nothing you can't get with a little diligence. You and I will get the same identical gear in end game, just that whoever forks out the cash gets it soon, THAT IS ALL. I’M LOOKING AT YOU MAPLESTORY!!\n-There is somewhat of a grind after lvl 100 onward, but there are dailies that you can do to rake in a few exp and money from.\n-Tutorial is mandatory if you wanna proceed , can be a drag when you want to level an alt.\n-A small portion of your money will be used regardless to buy spells, had you been doing quest, this really shouldn’t be an issue.\n\n\nThese are all the pro and con I can think off from my experience.\nI know it seems that there is a wall of text for con, but it is solely to justify it, so don't get too offput by it!\n","February 23","true","66.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Please note, I did take some pro's and cons from another review. I wanted this review to be most accurate, and unbiased in order to give the best perspective on the game. Finally, please note, in the "cons that may turn some players off" I am not bashing anyone, but I want to be clear that some things may turn others off form the game, and I would hate to see someone download the game and waste their time ons something that they would hate.\n\nThis game most certaintly brings back memories, but it still has its ups and downs. I will be straight forward with pro's and cons and what I beleive they could do with the cons' to fix the game. Before I begin, I beleive that this game has been dummed down so anyone that gives it a solid 5-10 hours can easily get the hang of it especially since they give you 200% exp and skill exp boosters for 20 days.\n\nPros:\n\n-Decent music\n- Class variety\n- Cute female outfits\n- Unique weapons not usually seen in other mmos (Gladiator Chakra)\n- Easy to use combat system\n- Dated Graphics, so anyone on just about any platform can play\n- Easy to play\n-Level up quickly\n-Easy to make money\n- added quests (from orginial game)\n- more players ( since added onto steam)\n-Unique combo system\n\nCons:\n\n-"Clunky UI, couldn't really find everything I needed and most of the windows were almost too big."\n\nObservation- this hasn't been an issue with the acutal version of the game. This will probably be fixed with an update later on.\n\n-"Simplified Questing, In 2 hours of play, only one quest was a fetch quest, the others were nothing but hunt this and dungeon that or warp here."\n\nSuggestion- the game has always had this problem.  I would love to see differnt types of quests, but due to how the game is formatted I do not believethat it would be possible without a rehaual of the game. Since Cabal II has been released I do not see it happening. The only thing I could reccommend is doing daily's, dungons, and grinding if questing isn't doing it for you.\n\n-Bugs specifically crashing- A lot of the time the game crashes, it is incredibly frustrating when I am in the middle of a quest and it crashes.\n\nObservation- EstSoft is really good at fixing their game. I beleive that this will be fixed in due time.\n\n-Everyhting will attack you- Something that turned me off while I played the Wizard class was that I needed to spend an immense amount of Alz(money) on hp potions becuase everything is hostile towards you. I hope they fix it in the future.\n\nSuggestion- I think this is obvious, make less monsters attack you.\n\nCons that may turn some players off:\n\n- "Automated fighting, when I played as a Shielder, my skills worked automatically, I don't know how I got it to work but it made the game even harder to enjoy. Some might like that, but I didn't."\n\nOpinion- Most MMO's have this in their game. It is a generic system that for the most part is common. If this is something that turns you off, you may want to steer away from the game. In order to combat this the game does have a unique combo system.\n\n- "Security Codes, if anything turns me off faster it's telling me I have to protect my account two and three times more with"\n\nOpinion- this is another common thing in most modern MMO's. These are for your protection but, if it is something that turns you off, steer away form the game. I understand that you may be annoyed by typing in a code before a login, but it is for your own account's protection.\n\n- "Objective KSing, Monsters can be kill stolen, making it super impossible to get certain quest done as any class that isn't a dps character such as the force shielder. For me, since it happened way too often, was really the first worst impression a game could give."\n\nOpinion- In a lot of MMO's that I have played this is a pretty common occurence. Perhaps, this type of MMO is not for you.  If you want to avoid this, play when the servers are less populated or switch channels.\n\n*Everything in quotes I took from Kayana Koe review. For more information about his experince on Cabal please read his review.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7/10. I love the game since it brings back memories. I am dissapointed that it was a perfect import. Many bugs exist such as the crashing bug, and the clunky UI. With later updates I'm sure they will fix it, but until then I can't give it a 0/10. I hope that you will give this game a try, but please keep what I wrote in mind and enjoy your gaming experince.\n\nSincerly,\n\nZjack 101 Wizard","March 7","true","106.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're not interested in PVP there's not much to do beyond run around and kill samey enemies. But I really like the overall aesthetic that it has going. The crystalline "astral weapons" are really cool, and attack animations are crazy over the top!\n\nThere are some cute mechanics spread throughout this game. Force Blader's "battle mode" transforms their magic spells into buffs, allowing for cool customization. You can equip the armor of any class even if it isn't meant for your own class, as long as you can meet its requirements. Although (sort of) recent changes have shrunken build diversity.\n\nAnd the "COMBO" system is really amazing! never seen it in another MMORPG. Once you hit level 30, you get a special power that can lower the casting time on all of your skills as long as you can keep up the tight timing!\n\n\n\n\nMain downsides for this game are the sheer repitition (nothing for PvE-minded players but repetitive grind), small community, and BOTS. But I don't think you can expect much more from a MMORPG of this age. If you do decide to try this, do NOT get the version on steam! Download client from ESTsoft, and play on the Titan server! Atlas has very low population, and is the only server available from steam client!","April 17","true","1.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Not so long, I never made it to "high levels" but enough to remember how fun this game was. I remember how friend of my was talking about how you can find hoverboard on low lvls and BE RIIIICH. Not sure if it was true or not but I choosed to believe him. Maybe because I was newbie, I didn't care much about quests - I just focused on killing monsters, finding some stuff and of course talking with that guy who played CABAL for really long time. It was fun times. Sadly, I had other Multi Massive Online RPGs on my mind back then so after reaching... maybe 20 level I never played it again. Back then lvling was much more harder if I remember it correct. Now, when CABAL made it on Steam, I really wanted to try it again.\n\nBloody Ice theme! I totally forgot how beatiful it was. Heck, whole soundtrack in CABAL Online is great. One of those that always is pleasant to hear. Graphics maybe looks little outdated but skill and special effects - nah, those are still impresing. Maybe it's not so popular like it used to be, but towns aren't really empty and even at low lvls (35 atm) there are people running around, doing quests or just killing mobs. Sadly, there are also plenty of bots and people spamming at town stuff like "selling in-game money for X" etc. While it's really annoying it's probably problem with many, if not every, free to play online game there is. Premium is expensive? Costumes are expensive? I don't really mind about all of this stuff. What I need from games like that are some grinding, someone to talk and fun. CABAL feels more like Multi Massive Online RPG game than 90% of games from this genre made nowadays, which is really sad thing. With all those possibilities, with amazing graphics you could made, Devs are aiming to make another World of Warcraft clone game or some ACTION ONLINE game. Really sad thing happened to this genre over years.\n\nCABAL Online is free to play, so the best you can do is download it and try it yourself. For now, I don't really have high level or didn't spend much time playing but when I feel like I want to play something good from this genre, I just log-in to CABAL and enjoy it.","June 5","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
