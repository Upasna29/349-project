"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/286380/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Strata is a game of layers, from it gameplay, presentation, and internal design. It's immediately accessible, yet provides the tools for a nearly endless array of puzzles, with a beautifully designed art style complimenting the relaxing, minimal audio arrangement. It doesn't assume to be more than it is, nor attempt to break your expectations of what it appears to be, but its narrow ambition isn't a con in this instance, but a deliberate decision that makes Strata and exceptionally easy to pick up enjoy puzzle game that's satisfying without getting bogged down by an abundance of challenge, perfectly finding its place in an offspring of zen puzzle games.\n\nIt takes but a moment to understand Strata's one mechanic, that of layering colored strands so the top color is that of the square underneath, but the gradual expansion of the size and complexity of levels keeps it from feeling mundane of simplistic. The lack of any constraints of penalties while solving puzzles allows for experimentation without consequences, which keeps the stress of trying to solve a particularly challenging puzzle at bay. Those wishing for something a little more difficult though will find solace in attempting "perfect" levels, which requires you to complete them without undoing any moves (essentially planning all of your moves from the start and having to remember to execute them in exactly that order). It doesn't change Strata from being a fairly breezily easy game for the most part, but the extra objective is a nice touch for those looking to work their minds a little more fervently.\n\nWhat drew me into Strata more than anything though was its mellow, inviting art style and beautifully composed sound design. The presentation is clean, but exceptionally stylized, with angles and camera movements positioned perfectly to make the experience feel like it is one giant moving picture. Layering strands creates patchwork designs of an inconsequential look, but somehow meaningful in their randomness. Each button press sparks an instrument to play in the background, making for a symphonic sound that grows as you get closer to completing a puzzle.\n\nLike Lyne and Kami before it, Strata is a basic but addictive puzzle game, that's offers a relaxing change of pace from the hyper violent and sensory overloading games of modern day. It might not ever be more than a nice "in between" game for most people, but at a low price point I would still instantly recommend it to anyone looking to chill out for a few minutes at a time (or more, given the large amount of content here). There's not much more I can say about it, so I'll keep this relatively short and simply say Strata is exactly what it appears to be, which is a charming puzzler that you ought to allot some time to yourself.","May 28, 2014","true","1.6"," 37 of 42 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","37","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/286380/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3061 products in account","Strata follows closely a recent trend of musically and aesthetically inclined simplistic indie puzzlers, such as Lyne, Kami, Hexcells and Circuits (the latter two to a lesser degree). Each of these titles offers a deceptively simplistic puzzler that hides a significant layer of complexity beneath. Strata is no exception, and of the lot, it is a strong contender for being my favorite of the bunch.\n\nThe premise for Strata's puzzles are simple; you begin each puzzle with a squared grid, with most squares representing a specific color. For each row and column, you must assign a single thread of any specific color of your choosing, with the goal of covering each colored square with its respective shade. The rub here is that many threads will overlap, and the only way to succeed in Strata is to ensure that each respective colored thread remains the top most thread on each of the same colored squares. It sounds simple enough, and in the beginning, it is. You start with a simple 2x2 grid, just to learn the basics, but quickly move on to the more common 3x3 and 4x4 grids, with far more challenging 5x5 and 6x6 grids ending each respective segment.\n\nThere are 7 sections, each containing 4 separate groups of puzzles, with each group varying between the aforementioned 3, 4, 5 and 6x grid types. Each of the 7 sections contains a slightly different music pattern from the rest, with the latter several carrying wildly different tones than its predecessors. The pleasant piano notes that accompany each click of the mouse and the movements of the threads standout to me as one of the driving forces behind my continued playing of Strata; the relaxing tones urge me to attempt one last puzzle, as does the enjoyment of the miniature sonata that accompanies each victory.\n\nThe visual aesthetic that accompanies the lovely music could not have been more perfectly placed, as there is nary a single unnecessary graphic or flashy fixture to interfere with the mood already set by the already relaxing musical performance. The movement of the colored threads in-game and in the menus remain smooth throughout, lending to the elegance of the piano with each movement.\n\nFor the simplicity that Strata provides, it's impressive the level of challenge that presents itself upon reaching the higher numbered grid sets. While challenging, I've yet to come across a single puzzle that instilled anything other than a relaxed state of mind while I slowly piece together where each thread should end up. and with only a few "perfect" segments under my belt, I enjoy the thought that my time with Strata is far from over, as I have several segments I've yet to even attempt. Ignoring this title on the notion that simplicity may accompany inadequacy would be a crime, and with the low price, I wholeheartedly recommend Strata to anyone in need of a relaxing time waster between responsibilities, and especially for anyone who enjoys a pleasant puzzle now and again.","May 28, 2014","true","1.9"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","0"

After making connections in "LYNE" and doing folds in "KAMI" now comes "STRATA". It' just simple, unique and challenging ...\n\nYou have colored ribbons from both sides and must weave them in the right way.  You play in a matrix with colored fields. The last ribbon on top must have the same color as the field color. Such simple it is, you should be alarmed: it's absolutely reverse thinking. Unfortunately there are only max 2 layers of ribbon possible in every level.\nThe game difficulty raises slow and usually it becomes harder with more colors. It starts at 3x3 fields and 2 colors, later it goes up to 5x5 and 5 colors and 6x6 and 4 colors.\n\nSomething strange is that you have to play a lot of levels (there are over 500 in this game) . For a set of 3x3  9 levels, for a set of 5x5 25 levels, and 6x6 even 36 levels. Sometimes the menu is bugged and the achievements are also not working right.

Its sound design effectively communicates success and failure in a manner befitting the 'zen puzzler' mould it is trying to fill. Its minimalism extends to interface in a way that promotes the kind of 5 minute drop-in gaming that makes these games so addicting. Still I can't recommend this game because it fails in the one place that really matter, it's a weak puzzle.\n\nFor the first 10 minutes or so I really enjoyed Strata, a simple but engaging puzzle format that seemed to have a lot of room for variation ahead of it. Then it hit me, there is a simple mechanical stratey to solve literally every puzzle of this format regardless of the size or number of colours. However complicated a solution may be it is always trivial to solve in reverse, this leads to the game quickly evolving into  busywork. Even for this low price with all the pretty packaging a bad puzzle is a bad puzzle and a thorough waste of time.\n\nI kept hoping that in the later sets the game would through in some new spin or twist on the mechanics, unless it appears in the final 6x6 it never comes. I feel like there is something hidden within this concept that could be saved, maybe a block type that is set by the bottom ribbon or requires a particular ribbon combination? In its current state the game is nothing but dissapointing.\n\nMINOR ISSUES: the game had a few navigation bugs in the level select menu which require a restart to make the game playable again. Some of the ribbon colours seem too close to each other leading to silly mistakes, this wouldn't be a big deal if the perfect system didn't punish undoing.","March 6, 2015","false","17.6"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","28","39","0","3"

Strata undoubtedly looks and sounds nice. I was impressed by the game's obvious polish before I started playing.\n\nOnce I started, however, I encountered the issue which makes me unable to recommend this game in the slightest to anyone looking to solve puzzles. Every grid in Strata can be solved by a "greedy" algorithm. There is no confusion possible, as if multiple options are present, it doesn't actually matter which you pick; all will work. It is therefore hard for me to call Strata a puzzle game. Were we required instead to match the bottom square, solving puzzles would be disturbingly straightforward, as any move that wasn't immediately wrong would lead to a valid solution. The present game merely requires performing the easy solution in reverse, which while perhaps a memory challenge still does not a puzzle make.\n\nThis backward structure also leads to an unfortunate quirk. The majority of grids could be solved without using every colored strip, but this isn't permitted. You must instead place any extraneous strips first, partially obscuring the puzzle without actually affecting your solution in any way. It feels a bit silly.\n\nI can't help but think that the game's designer was aware of this flaw to some extent, since they mention in the description that "[o]ver time patterns emerge and your tactics may evolve." I mostly wrote this review because I had never encountered this problem before. Every other puzzle game I've played had some claim to being objectively puzzling, generally by being an instance of an NP- or PSPACE-hard problem (like sudoku or sokoban, respectively). In contrast, generalized Strata puzzles are very clearly in P, and it seems many other players have stumbled upon the same simple algorithmic solution.\n\nStrata's artistic design is fantastic, and it would probably be a joy to play if you were looking to relax while looking at colorful arrangements. Unfortunately, it lacks puzzles.","July 19, 2015","false","0.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

Its artistic textures create a soothing gameplay.\n\nThe game starts with 2x2 tutorial puzzles. Tutorial is nice and easy to understand. It shows the player what his/her goal is, and how the ribbons are used.\n\nIn the puzzles, the player is given a set of different colored ribbons. These ribbons can be placed on rows or lines of the diagonal puzzle ground. Puzzle grounds have colors in intersection of rows and colors. As expected, when ribbons are placed on rows and lines, they intersect. Puzzle logic comes from this intersection. Whichever ribbon is placed later, its color occupies that intersection. Players’ goal is to create the same pattern on the puzzle ground.\n\nThis game has a static logic for its puzzles. That means there are no new additions when player advances to later puzzles. Logic is always the same. Only things that change are size of the ground and number of the ribbons’ colors. Smallest puzzles’ grounds are 2x2 and largest ones are 6x6. If I calculated correctly there are 485 puzzles (excluding tutorials) separated into 7 sets and each set is separated further into 4 waves. It is worth noting that this static logic may be a deal breaker for some people.\n\nPuzzles’ difficulty is tricky to talk about. There is a trick to solve the puzzles. This trick can be used to solve even the most-complicated-looking-level. If player can figure it out then very few puzzles are challenging and rest is easy. So it is safe to say that unofficial puzzle goal in this game is to solve the trick. Levels can be considered as tools to figure it out.\n\nDuring my gameplay, I came across some minor bugs. These bugs did not affect actual puzzles; they were all in main menu. The game has a menu that resembles a navigation system instead of standard button menu. And this menu can sometimes act weird. Luckily the game can be restarted in a few seconds so even a restart doesn’t make player loose anything. Regardless, they should be fixed.\n\nAs a final note, games achievements are all easily achievable. So this is a good game to get a “perfect game” status if you are interested in such things.\n\nPros:+ Good Art: The game has nice textures and uses pastel colors, which makes it easy on the eyes.\n\n+ Soothing Gameplay: Art style and realistic instrument (piano, classic guitar and bell) notes that play after almost every player action create a relaxing environment.\n\n+ Originality: Puzzle logic looks really unique.\n\nCons:- Repetitive: Because this is a puzzle game, it is not necessarily a bad thing. Also it is a little expected. That said, using the same logic throughout the game results doing the exact same thing again and again.\n\n- Minor bugs: The game has some minor bugs that don’t affect actual puzzles. Still they should be fixed.\n\n\nVerdict:It was nice to play a game that actually made me relaxed for a change. These kinds of games show that games are not all about action or achievements; so I recommend it. Still it is worth noting that this puzzle game is mostly recommended to people who care “solving puzzles” more than which puzzles they solve, due to its static logic.\n\n\nP.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 31, 2015","true","4.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","2"

You're playing with hamonious swatches of colour, with simple rules: you're throwing ribbons diagonally through a grid, with the goal of matching each square's colour to that of the topmost ribbon passing over it.\n\nThe problem is the lack of variety and progress in the puzzles' difficulty. True, there are hundreds of puzzles available, but no new element or rule is ever added to make things more interesting. And the algorithm to solve the puzzles becomes obvious after a short while, meaning that bigger grids may take a bit longer to solve, but are not more mentally challenging than the smaller ones.\n\nWhile the minimal visual design is good enough to hold itself up until the game's end, I cannot say the same about the sounds, made solely of highly reverbed piano and strings notes. It gets too repetitive and irritating after a while, even if the last sets of puzzles change the instruments to guitars and christmas bells.\n\nWorse still, the menu is completely buggy, making it frequent that you can't move to the next sets of levels or even quit the game properly (use alt-F4 when this happens to force-quit).\n\nOverall, Strata is simply too basic to entertain.

Navigating the menus often glitches, making the game unplayable until you force-close the window and restart. Worse, the achievements are bugged. They are handed out long before you actually meet the necessary criteria. You might think that's a good thing, but really it just steals some of your motivation away, robs you of part of the feeling of accomplishment when you complete a set perfectly.\n\nA quick look at the game's forum will show you that these bugs have been around for years, yet there has never been a single appearance by a dev to respond, let alone fix, these problems. They dumped the game on Steam as-is and then washed their hands of it. I will not encourage anyone to financially support a company that doesn't stand by their products, but abandons them immediately after launch.\n\nIf you can find the game in a bundle (as I did, fortunately) or at an extremely steep discount, then you might enjoy playing it for a few hours. But I would rather not see an unsupported game be sold for full price. And it's a shame, because with a couple of small bugfixes, this would have been a positive review.","September 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If so, this is the BOMB.COM for you!\n\nStrata isn't fast-paced. Or action-filled. Or multiplayer. Strata is relaxing. Calm. Fun. It's a very simple game: draw lines on a grid, so every square is covered by the same coloured line. But here's the twist: the colour needs to be the same on the top. What starts off as a simple, easy game becomes a mind-boggling addictive puzzle. I could spend the same amount of time into Counter-Strike as i could with Strata. It's that good. Soon, you'll be matching up lines everywhere!\n\nBut gameplay isn't the only thing. Strata is beautifully designed, with clean, neat, paper-like formatting that is both relaxing to the eye and wonderfully complex. In addition, the sound is well done. Timing right with the game, it eases you straight into a position of comfortability and easy-mindedness.\n\nBeware! This game most certainly isn't Borderlands 2, but it is well worth 3.99 (2.99 on sale), for a relaxing puzzle game that you can play for hours on end.

A lot of it comes down to an exercise in memorization until you've really got the core mechanics down to the point where you can just eye a puzzle and figure out the first spot that needs to be set in stone. There's plenty of content here, though; 28 sets of puzzles altogether, and the size of each set is based on the size of the boards within (3x3 boards have 9 puzzles, 4x4 boards have 16, up to 6x6 which have 36 each). I don't think it's the kind of game that you can play a lot of in one sitting, though, but as a game to occasionally come back to to keep your mind sharp, I'd definitely recommend it.","October 25, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The correct solution is the reverse of that sequence\n\nI enjoyed the first 15min of the game, and then I "worked" (not played) for another 2+ hours just for 100% achievement\n\nIf you want a casual game, Strata is not that bad, but if you are into puzzles, this game is not for you.","May 6","false","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well worth the small price. It also contains a LOT of puzzles that provide quite a lot of play time compared to the price. The music/sound is minimal, but pleasant, consisting of ethereal piano flourishes in time with your choices of moves. And there's really no way to lose or fail, only different levels of winning (i.e. perfect score or using a couple hints/undos), so the game won't frustrate or stress you as some puzzle games might.\nThat being said, the menu can sometimes glitch when you're trying to navigate it, leaving you stuck at a certain puzzle list. It's nothing that can't be solved by ctrl-alt-deleting your way out and relaunching the game, though. It also lacks a volume control beyond "sound on/off", which can be solved by adjusting the system volume instead of the game volume. These mild inconveniences are literally the only things I have to complain about, which is high praise indeed!","May 29, 2014","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You may find challenge in the later leveles as the puzzles get bigger... or you may not. A great game to pick up and play when you have a little free time. In fact, it's best you play this in small doses because it can feel a bit repetitive if you try to play a whole set in one setting.

I usually shy away from puzzle games that bring me more upset than they do reward, and I feel this one manages to walk the thin balance between both. Pretty relaxing in periods of anxiety, in my opinion. Have already successfully recommended it to friends, will keep recommending it.","March 13","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's interesting enough to keep me returning to it, but not overly complex to the point of frustration. It is also low-pressure, with no time limits or real penalties for mistakes. It does have a few minor bugs. First, to exit the game, you back out of each level until you return to the title screen, then press Esc. Sometimes the screen will glitch, causing you to move to random levels instead. When this happens, the only way to exit the game is to press Alt+f4. The other issue is that the color selection doesn't seem to register consistently. I don't know if it is an issue with the hitbox, or if it drops mouse clicks, but I often find myself placing a ribbon with the color I was previously using instead of the one I attempted to select. It doesn't occur often enough to make the game unplayable, but it is a minor annoyance.","March 14","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you click in those squares in menu and further into UI. I really enjoyed playing Strata, but it really does get harder when the board widens and broadens. Gameplay is easy, you will catch in a while what's the main objective of each level. Maybe it will develop in future, but right now I fight with those 4x4 with 3 different colours. Graphics are very neat and nice to look at. Just a very good job.","July 11, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcgibbslap/recommended/286380/","mcgibbslap","McGibbslap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcgibbslap/","949 products in account","The good:\nI like the concept of the puzzles.  It's unique, and does take a little time to think through.  Subtly a memory puzzle at times.  Very consistent, which can be tricky to make in a puzzle game.  The presentation is also generally quite pretty, and the music is nice and relaxing, and each move you make sounds rather musical as well so that's nice.\n\nThe bad:\nRepetitive. No surprises here whatsoever, and once you come up with a strategy for the early puzzles every other one works exactly the same way.  I like the puzzle idea but now I feel like I've done as many of them as I'd ever want to.  Game awards a crown for a "perfect" score, which just means no undos - this could benefit from some kind of extra challenges, I'd say by taking advantage of the multiple solutions each puzzle has in its current form.  Game feels meant for a touchscreen, and I wouldn't want to play it with a mouse.  Also, no indication on a puzzle screen how many more puzzles are left in the set - I've taken to tallying them just so I know how far I have left.\n\nThe ugly:\nWhile I've never had much issue with the gameplay (aside from what I think is fat fingers on my part but I could be wrong), the interface is bugged to hell.  Sometimes I'll exit a puzzle set (seems to happen when I exit one without completing it all the way) and the puzzle set select screens bug out and overlay on top of each other and navigation becomes impossible.  When you complete a level and all the ribbons slide away, the two on the bottom don't quite make it all the way off the top of the screen before blinking out, implying that the game was never really intended for a landscape view (and really, the left and right 1/3 of the screen is almost empty the entire game).  Most damning, the achievements for completing and perfecting an entire puzzle set trigger on completing and perfecting the FIRST puzzle in a set, meaning you can get 14/24 achievements from playing a tiny fraction of the available puzzles.\n\nVerdict:\nI do not recommend spending more than $1.00 for this game.","May 8","false","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
