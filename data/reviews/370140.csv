First, when I left a level to return to the main screen and then went back in (level 3, if it matters) the music and sounds effects went silent. Second, change the controls to the more intuitive WASD. I'm already holding shift and hitting the space bar when I fail it's more natural to look around with A and D.\n\nI've only played a little, looking forward to more!","February 17","true","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
