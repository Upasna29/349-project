The story is great - and this is what this game is all about.\n\nIt is a game which takes itself seriously. If you haven't notived by the visuals already, this is not your usual Monkey Island type of adventure. Compared to comic books, this could be entitled graphic novel.\n\nThe voice actors are very well chosen, as they deliver the atmosphere very well. Looking at the graphics, they are for sure not high-res SSAO 2xAA 3D whatnot. But that doesn't matter, the 2D pixels are perfect for this game.\n\nThe puzzles are most of the time very well thought through, but I must admit that I've taken a peek into the walkthrough sometimes, as I got impatient following the story as I couldn't figure out the solution fast enough.\n\nI havent noticed any bug, so kudos to QA as well.","November 25, 2013","true","8.5"," 77 of 84 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","77","84","0","0"

Gemini Rue is mostly narrative driven, and in order to avoid spoilers I am just saying that it was nice sci-fi short-story material and managed to keep my attention til the end.\n\nIt has to be noted that the noir-ish atmosphere the game creates in places is quite excellent, it is almost relaxing in a way - was quite nice to come home from work and do some off-world detective work.\n\nOn the downside: puzzles and controls have a slight tendency to be annoying. I enjoyed the limited amount of locations, I quickly felt "at home" - but this also ment plenty of backtracking through "known" locations all the time because there are some unfortunate moments when new items / people spawn once certain conditions are met. The game tries its best in providing hints and feedback through the characters to give you a sense of direction, but it could have been smoother in places. Same goes for the actual interface, the right-click combined actions/inventory felt outdated and clunky especially in one or two spots where certain functions weren't explained very well (at all?) . Still, this is nothing a quick glance at a walkthrough cannot solve and shouldn't stop you from checking out this fun little sci-fi story.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is proper Wadjet Eye quality and a worthy addition to your collection. If you enjoyed their other, earlier releases, you will enjoy Gemini Rue.","October 8, 2015","true","9.7"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","39","40","0","4"

It uses the topics of identity and nature in order to tell the profound parallel story of one Delta-Six and Azriel Odin. 7 hours in and I am left dumbfounded by this masterpiece.\n\nAfter finishing the game, here are a few things I liked about it..\n\n- Excellent voice acting. Shelly Smith-Shenoy who plays one of the female roles does an excellent job of playing an innocent and insightful individual.\n\n- Deep concept. The game plays with fire by toying with the idea of something as profound as identity. It opens up a lot of possibilities right from the moment of the opening scene.\n\n- Interesting puzzle presentation. Some of the puzzles in this game put an emphasis on a macro-level understanding of the environment. You are tasked with solving puzzles which then require you to go through more layers in order to complete the objective.\n\nThis is a great example of a game with a strong premise.

It has an old film noir, Sci-Fi Blade Runner feel to it with gorgeous artwork that feels retro and fresh at the same time. The premise and feel reminds me of a story straight out of Cowboy Bebop, with twists that anyone paying attention to should enjoy. Voice acting and music (very moody and dark ambiance), was also spot on.\n\nI really found the puzzles engaging as well. A lot of point and click adventure games I have trouble getting into simply because their "gameplay" is either much too easy or just too vague in telling me what I am exactly supposed to be doing. I didn't think Gemini Rue had this problem. There were puzzles that were easy solve, and others I had to think about for long minutes before coming up with an answer. The Easter Eggs and achievements spread throughout the game was also a plus for me.\n\nThe only problem I had with the game was the fact that it felt too short, and that after all is said and done, the characters are technically confined to two basic areas throughout the whole game when I wished there had been more to explore... But honestly the game did take me quite a bit of time to beat, and as for the lack of a wider world, I just enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end.\n","November 6, 2014","true","25.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

It stood strong and compelling from beginning to end, and unravelled nicely throughout--right up to a great end.  The graphic scenery really sets the moods throughout, from ghetto and dirty, and dreadful and oppressive, to sterility and tranquility, and to openness and lonliness.  Every aspect of this game blends very well with each other.  The developer commentary scattered throughout adds a nice, revealing and funny touch.\n\nI highly recommend Gemini Rue to all gamers who enjoy an adventure game with a solid story, that knows how to tell that solid story, and contains audio actors that breathe life into the characters that create the solid story.

While a small game, it is very well-made with a good story and voice acting.  Gameplay is a bit clumsy as adventure games often are, requiring actions to be performed through an inventory menu rather than having separate keys for separate actions.\n\nThe best part about the game is the well-balanced puzzle design.  One of the big pitfalls I've found with adventure games is making the puzzles too difficult to understand while others make the game so simple that there's hardly any player interaction required.  This one manages to find a good balance though there are still a couple parts that get confusing.  It is one of the best examples I've found outside Amanita games though.\n\nThe really big disappointment for me was the ending.  I don't want to spoil anything but the ending just didn't make sense to me.  I like how the story ended up, but the way it was done just didn't seem right.\n\nIn any case, it's a high quality adventure game that doesn't succumb to common adventure game pitfalls.

For example, there is one particular puzzle where you need to call a guy using your communicator and try to get some information out of him. If you don’t choose the specifically correct dialogue options when speaking to him, he hangs up. This is quite believable and is probably what an actual human would do. Of course, this game being what it is, you can just call him again and again and again and try a different set of dialogue options each time, and every single time he responds as though you’re speaking to him for the first time. It doesn’t matter how many times you call him – even on the fifth call, he responds as though you’ve not just spoke to him four times previously using ever so slightly different variations on your script. If this were an actual person speaking to another human being, calling the person again and trying the same script with tiny variations would get you laughed at and hung up on immediately.\n\nThe above kind of puzzle is narratively inappropriate because it is just not how a human being would behave at all. The playing experience stops being a nicely flowing story of which you, the gamer, are an integral part, and becomes an arbitrary clicking exercise, jarring you out of the narrative. The above puzzle is also guilty of another puzzle design sin: it seems to exist solely to pad out the game. It isn’t hard, don’t require much thought, and just involves trying different combinations over and over again, wasting a lot of time in the process. I wish I could say this was the only example of this, but it sadly isn’t.\n\nMany of the puzzles in Gemini Rue aren’t game ruining, and they aren’t completely nonsensical (unlike other infamous examples from this genre: the rubber ducky puzzle in The Longest Journey, anyone?) but they are generally quite wonky and boring. At one point you have to find a Carbon Ray Stabilizer to fix your lockpicks (why a Carbon Ray Stabilizer, I have no idea). Rather than buying it from a vendor or asking someone where to find one, you have to search around an abandoned building with some crates hidden towards the back. It’s not even easy to get to the crates – you have to get someone to help you. You have to see the crates when exploring, think “hang on, they must be really important” not “they’re just some old crates at the back of an abandoned room” and then go out of your way to work out how to get to them. Lo and behold, there’s one in the crates. Why is it there? I have no idea. I was just aimlessly exploring because I had no idea what to do next and just so happened to stumble on the solution. That’s not a satisfying solution to the problem, and it makes absolutely no narrative sense.\n\nThe strange thing is that I often feel like I’m crazy for feeling this way; support for old-school point and click games seems overwhelming, and any critical opinions seem to be drowned in a sea of nostalgic rage. I seriously want to love games like this, I really do, but their puzzles make them a gargantuanly frustrating experience. If you’re willing to have a walkthrough in one hand at all times and you’re willing to suspend your disbelief through some poorly designed puzzles, then I would probably recommend this. Unfortunately, I felt frustrated more than I felt enjoyment, which is not something I want to experience in a game.","March 5, 2015","false","8.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

I enjoyed latest Telltale work, but I would hardly place them in adventure genre. Gemini Rue on the other hand is a real classic point-and-click adventure game, though you could say that the biggest flaws and offenders of the genre were left out. You won't find any illogical obstacles and puzzles, pixel hunting or absurd item combining.\n\nWhat you get is a great sci-fi noiresque story, where you are a detective looking for his lost brother on some god-forgotten planet. Later the game opens up and lets you switch between the two main characters, the detective and the missing brother. It really does feel like you're detective, getting dirty and doing the groundwork: asking around, getting true identity of people, searching information about them in database. Top this with action sequences where you can cover and shoot at your enemies and you really get an exceptional adventure game. Voice acting and writing is astounding and the story itself is intriguing and suprising. All of that in a indie game made by the handful of people! I did enjoy the visual style of the game and I think it befits the game, but I guess some people could argue that the resolution is too low.\n\nOverall, superb game, highly recommended. A great reminder that the adventure games are a great way to tell a story and don't have to be obscure and plagued with bizzare puzzles.","May 13, 2014","true","8.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It is a point and click so sometimes you need to be patient. There are times I was getting ahead of myself, where I would try to perform actions that are 3 "clicks" away yet. The audio in this game is fantastic. The game is playable without audio, but you really need to hear the voice acting to get the whole experience.

It's got old school pixel graphics and just great voice acting all-around. The puzzle elements are also a lot of fun. The story behind Gemini Rue may seem derivative. It's set in a universe like the TV show Firefly and it's movie counterpart Serenity, it has the tone and feel of Blade Runner and has the plot of Total Recall. But it never made it bad. It's just taking the good stuff on what I like about science fiction.\n\nYou play as Azriel Odin, an ex-assassin that is looking for his brother on the planet of Barrucus, which is part of a Gemini Star System, a system that won it's independence after a war and is now run by a crime syndicate known as the Boryokudun. The other character you will get to play is Delta-Six whom is a patient of a mysterious facility. This is all I can say about the story without going into spoilers.\n\nThroughout the game, you talk to characters, solve puzzles, do detective-like work to learn about things and occasionally go on shoot-outs. There's an interesting shooting mechanic in the game that you will learn how to use.\n\nAll of the characters in Gemini Rue are well written and feel real. The philosophical themes of identity and memories are also explored in this game and is pretty much what the game wants to explore and talk about. There are a couple downsides of this game. Some of the puzzles are little too difficult and the fictional universe that is offered in Gemini Rue remains mostly unexplored with the exception of a single city on one planet and a facility somewhere else.\n\nBut I recommend this game to Science fiction, cyberpunk and story adventure fans. It's definitely a must-buy!","December 28, 2014","true","19.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I did not have any difficulty here, once you learn the timing of the enemy it is a breeze. Finding my way to the next plot point was challenging at first, some areas are linear but most need attention paying to investigation and a bit of trial and error.

The story has interesting themes and is portrayed in an interesting fashion. The voice acting fit the characters well and they were all unique. I also liked how the music was very understated and complimented the scenes nicely. It was definitely satisfying to play through to the end and see how the story unfolded, leaving a very satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe graphics are beautifully drawn and make the world feel immersive. Some backgrounds are only seen for a few seconds yet are still richly detailed and almost breathtaking to look at, so I commend the developer for that.\n\nThe puzzles hit the right balance between challenging and logical, there weren't any weird and crazy parts of the game's internal logic. Some areas of the game can be a little tricky and annoying to figure out which part of the map to go to next as you backtrack through familiar areas a few times but nothing too egregious.\n\nThere is combat through gunplay. Instead of just pressing the use button on gun and clicking on an enemy in a traditional point n click style, there is combat where the player takes cover, aims, and has to time their shots in the minigame. While it isn't very complex, it breaks up the puzzles and provide an interesting way of doing action in a style of game like this. I noticed a couple of glitches such as when a sprite in the background would be placed on the top layer in front of my character in the foreground, but this only happened twice.\n\nDefinitely recommended for people who enjoy interesting sci-fi cyberpunk stories with good voice acting and story, especially considering that the majority was drawn, written and programmed by just one student, so props to him for making such an engaging and interesting game. Worth checking out, especially for the really neat easter eggs.","November 25, 2015","true","6.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Seems uninteresting? At first it's boring. I admit it. But then, as soon the game's cryptic nature slowly unveils: a symphony is played. The plot is the real thing here, for IT IS THE GAME. Everything lean on it. This detective story is not an ordinary one, it's more a tale than a noire. There will be a plot twist, but it's a twist that is not trivial at all. It is a fight between light and dark, good versus bad in a corrupt and decayed galaxy (cyberpunk-theme). Cons are the puzzles, they are too easy and gunfights are a little clanky, nevertheless these are just two little faults on an overall masterpiece.\n\nLet's get down to brass tacks:\n\nGenre: point-and-click/sci-fi/cyberpunk adventure/noire\n\nAI: irrelevant.\n\nDifficulty: easy (there are no real challenges, it's more a tale than an actual game).\n\nPlot: great plot. Playing this game is like reading a solid sci-fi book.\n\nAtmosphere: dark and decayed. This game is great mainly because it uses "ancient" graphics ('90s) through which is difficult to convey emotions. The dev team achieved this and for this they have to be commended. GREAT JOB!\n\nGraphics: voluntarily outdated. It's more a game with substance than appearance. It has a lot to talk about so graphics is not a core value.\n\nAudio: voluntarily old. This serves just as the "thing" that glue-up together atmosphere, plot and ultimately fun: without voices and/or sounds the game would be boring in my opinion.\n\nFUN FACTOR: investigating an ever-raining-mining planet under the guise of a cop while at the same time another person tries to survive within a space station. Well, it is adventurous is it not? Thus we can say it is...FUN!\nConclusion: a game that focuses on both atmosphere and plot. "Substance is what it counts" it seems to say. Are you interested in exploring a dark city and try to beat the odds? Did you like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner? If yes then: get it!\n\nThanks for reading.","May 15","true","9.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I am a huge sucker for cyberpunk detective stories such as Blade Runner or Snatcher so of course I loved this one.\nThe art design is most likely a result of a budget, rather than an artistic choice but at least it looks like its actually a game released in the past unlike so many other "retro style indie" games with artists just being lazy. But there were a few times where the graphics were unable to convey an image, so I got stuck in a couple parts where a few pixels were supposed to be an object I could interact with. These were the only parts where I couldn't figure out what to do and it felt unfair in the wrong way. The rest of the game was pretty well designed though. I gotta say, it doesn't feel like an indie game to me, it feels like it was an actual regular game just released in 1991.\nThe voice-acting is surprisingly good and the music and sound desgin was top notch as well.\nI actually wanted to know what was going to happen, so I consider that a good story. Point and Click games often have well written plots (for video games) and lots of dialogue, this one is no different.\nI heavily recommend this game to fans of sci-fi or detective noir stories.","January 20, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

For good because it stylistically fits right beside games like Rise of the Dragon, Dreamweb and Beneath a Steel Sky. It’s nice to see the style be kept alive.\n\nUnfortunately the game also plays like a 90s adventure game. The controls and interactions are clunky, with none of the streamlining you’d see in newer games. Something as simple as getting up on a box and climbing a ladder involves 4 clicks and 2 keyboard commands, sometimes even more.\n\nThe story almost pulls off what it’s trying to do. In terms of mood there’s nothing wrong with it. The music, sound and visuals work together well. The problem lies with the dialog, which especially towards the end don’t deliver as strongly as it needed to. It’s so close, just another few editing passes might have done it. It doesn’t ruin it, it just stumbles across the finish line. I thought the conceit of the story was done ok. It’s not the best take on the concept, as I thought Dollhouse for example did it much better. But I thought it was alright for what it is.\n\nThe game isn’t a must play. It's good, but not as brilliant as it could have been. But if you feel like playing something that's 90s style, this will deliver, pixel hunting and all.","May 15, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The breath meter is exactly like the golf swing meter, just click in optimal green zone. easy to use, shallow functionality.\nHonestly not a real focus around combat anyways, the story is always trying to make you think about how to approach the current problem or what to do next. and it keeps me playing. often when trying to use an item on an object it won't like or your not supposed to use resulted in me laughing quite a bit at what the dialog of my character.\nThere were and still is times I'm in the game stumped about what to do next, once I was so sure i knew what to do I thought the game was glitched so I checked the guide, I was missing a small step that was very hard to find or think about doing.

You'll find yourself stuck because you failed to do something as simple as stand on a box or do a sequence of clicks in a specific order, and there are no quest markers telling you where to go or what to do next. So I strongly recommend referencing a guide for the game, that way you can skip over the tedious game play and enjoy the top knotch story.","January 16, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a hand-drawn pixel graphicated game. It’s a point and click adventure with a unique gameplay and style. Its Story has this cyberpunk adventure feel to it with its dark sci-fi feel and the most depressing atmosphere. The story is really its core purpose and holy what a story, i was just gobsmacked for such an amazing game; the gripping characters, the helpless feeling and high tech sci-fi cyberpunk future (23rd century) it’s like adding chocolate custard to a scrummy chocolate cake. It’s got images of the characters that speak, great voice acting, amazing soundtrack, interesting puzzles, secrets & collectibles and is a rather challenging game.\n\n10/10 for one of the best experiences in gaming history, and for the amount of love the game dev put into this!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YoreIore/recommended/80310/","YoreIore","Azathoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YoreIore/","300 products in account","An adventure game set in a bleak dystopian future that is dominated by the criminal organisation known as the Boryokudan.  You play as Azriel Odin, an ex-assassin turned cop who is searching for a defector from the Gemini System, as well as Delta-Six, an inmate who has had his memory wiped by "The Director".  Fate brings these characters together in this highly enjoyable intense point and click title.\n\nLike other games from developer Wadjet Eye Games, Gemini Rue is a retro-graphic adventure game created using the Adventure Game Studio engine.  There is enough innovation here to make this game fresh, while still retaining a nostalgic 90's feel.  I was constantly reminded of the Blade Runner game and Beneath A Steel Sky when playing this and the developer managed to create a fantastic atmosphere as well as a relatively challenging gameplay experience.\n\nI find that most modern adventure games sacrifice challenging puzzles for an interesting story (see the Blackwell Series).  However, Gemini Rue did stump me a few times and also provided an excellent story that wouldn't feel out of place on the big screen or in some form of graphic novel series.  The story had me hooked and being able to change playable character's on the fly was a great design choice.\n\nInnovation comes in the form of shootouts, the use of terminals for information and choosing when to switch your character.  This last aspect was very welcome when I found myself stuck at certain points, I would just switch character and see what I could do to progress their story.\n\nThe graphics are not "cutting edge", nor are they supposed to be.  The game looks and feels exactly as intended.  You are here for the story and the challenge that comes with a point and click adventure game.  I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre and if studios like Wadjet Eye Games keep producing titles like this, then the genre is at its healthiest since the glory days of the 90's.","April 29, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fans of old Sierra and Lucasarts games will feel right at home.\n\nThe atmosphere can be summed up in one word: oppressive. Rarely have I felt so unwelcome - which is good! The music and sound design are top-notch. However, the voice acting sometimes seems to be a bit flat. The pixelated (but by no means ugly) graphics definitely are a throwback to the "golden age" of adventure games. Don't let them discourage you, the visuals aren't everything. The combat is clunky, but generally not a huge bother.\n\nIt's the puzzles that make an adventure game. In Gemini Rue they're very intuitive and neither too easy nor too hard. Some of them can even be solved in multiple ways, which I felt was a nice touch and shows how much thought was put into making this game. A developer commentary is included, giving further insight into the authors' minds. There are some visual bugs, but nothing gamebreaking.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable game, even if you're not a fan of the genre.

These are nothing new, but they are used well and break the monotony that sets in from hours of pointing and clicking.\nThe graphics are good (but the pixelated look may be a problem form some) and the art direction is great, there is little confusion about what to do, everything is cleverly hinted at. Sadly, this makes the puzzles seem a bit easy, but on the good side there are very few instances of pixel hunting and when is does get used it makes perfect sense in the context of the scenes.\nThe first part of the story is very good, I liked the mood and the mystery surrounding the events, sadly the big twist becomes apparent about halfway through the game and I kept hoping for something out of left field which never came.\nOverall it was a good experience, with great music, great voice acting and a nice, although predictable, story.","April 26, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The style of the game is very  Blade Runner and the voice acting - Music is top notch. Gameplay is involving with very logical puzzles. There are very little things that broke the experience but the story and the atmosphere were what kept me playing.

Fans of old Sierra and Lucasarts games will feel right at home.\n\nThe atmosphere can be summed up in one word: oppressive. Rarely have I felt so unwelcome - which is good! The music and sound design are top-notch. However, the voice acting sometimes seems to be a bit flat. The pixelated (but by no means ugly) graphics definitely are a throwback to the "golden age" of adventure games. Don't let them discourage you, the visuals aren't everything. The combat is clunky, but generally not a huge bother.\n\nIt's the puzzles that make an adventure game. In Gemini Rue they're very intuitive and neither too easy nor too hard. Some of them can even be solved in multiple ways, which I felt was a nice touch and shows how much thought was put into making this game. A developer commentary is included, giving further insight into the authors' minds. There are some visual bugs, but nothing gamebreaking.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable game, even if you're not a fan of the genre.

Well- with this game, you're there!\nA sci-fi romp following a split story between a prisoner who lost his memory, and a detective- you point and click your way through this beast.\n\nSeemingly taking ideas from point'n'click adventures before it (Beneath a Steel Sky, Blade Runner, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream), this one manages to meld the lot and create its own beast.\n\nStory is solid, with some twists in the tale, "trust noone".  Puzzles are plentiful, but sometimes a pain as items appear when a puzzle is solved on a completely different screen- or a dialogue box that you happened to have missed.  There are no "real" muliple endings, what you get is a linear story, but if you do something at the end you can get an extra line of dialogue.\n\nGraphics are very welcome.  Instead of looking "old", the lo-resolution pixel art gives the game character, screamingly familiar to a mid-90's adventure.  Effects, such as rain manage to give the world a sense of life, even though the setting is so dark.\nThe zoomed in pictures in dialogue were OK at best.  Compared to the games smaller pixel art, it felt to me that these had far less character- most of the time not fitting to the ingame graphic and voice.  Without these, I felt the game would have created more of a link to the player with their character if it were just the pixel guys opening mouths and bobbing their heads.  I hope they include an option to turn off the dialogue graphics in their next game.\n\nGameplay was mostly point and click, with a gun fight mini-game.  Point and click was standard,  right click and you can (eye), (hand), (foot) etc.  The game is fairly short at roughly 9 hours, and a few more if you want to find the achievements.\n\nThere is a problem that you can't pull up your inventory to look at items (there is no inventory button).  In order to look at an item you need to right click on an ingame object, then right click on your item (makes little sense).\n\nBugs:  There were some graphic bugs, but nothing game breaking.  I found that sometimes the right have of the screen was garbled after a load.  Also, if you have an instance of Chrome in the background, dialogues could not be shown / heard.  It was all skipped.  One screen also had a graphics "layering" problem, where the background was infront of the forground (groundfloor of the apt building).\n\nOverall;  Gemini Rue is a great point'n'click adventure that should've been released in the 90's... But it's out now!  There are a couple of bugs, but they don't break the game.  The amount of character and soul put into this project is worthy of a lookup, this is a game I'm proud to say I've completed.","January 30, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

With an unforgettable story and quirky puzzles, the few gameplay sections that may try to detract from the experience couldn’t manage to deter me from playing through this gem. I’d easily recommend this game to fans of old adventure games.”\n\n8/10 TJBs","January 28, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3danyon/recommended/80310/","3danyon","Tuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3danyon/","375 products in account","It's a point-and-click adventure game of the older variety (puzzling puzzles and all), which, for some reason, puts some people off from the very outset. Assuming you're not from that group, however, you will find a game with a pretty unique and intriguing story, accompanied by a very fitting noir atmosphere (I hesitate to call it cyberpunk, though similar themes are employed) and well executed retro graphics. On the other hand, the story and the atmosphere are the good parts of the game.\n\nWhy do I say that? Well, even when it works the controls, particularly those for shooting, are a bit of an annoyance. The game would've been better without those action sequences, but alas, they're there and can be endured. The main complaint, however, is that the game is rather buggy in game-breaking ways. There are workarounds, but it still makes it a bad product. For example, on Windows 7 x64, the first thing one has to do is to turn the Steam overlay off, or else any alt-tabbing or shift-tabbing means that all dialogue will be in fast-forward mode, making it impossible to follow the plot. Resonance, another game from the same developer, has the same issue, so at least I kind of knew about it.\n\nNext, after a restart my saves just disappeared. Turns out this can be fixed by moving them from \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Gemini Rue\reslists\Saves\nto \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Gemini Rue\Saves but why should I have to? Oh, and the escape key needed to access the menu sometimes stops working, at which point one should apparently realize that hitting shift first helps. Oh well, at least I didn't have to patch the game with specific versions of DLL files, but that reportedly happens too.\n\nNow, if you are willing to subject yourself to all of that, there's a nice, really well-voiced sci-fi story in it for you.  If not, you're probably just being sensible. Either way, I can't really recommend paying full price for the game. Sales level prices, yes, but perhaps only to fans of the genre.","January 10, 2015","false","7.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It presents itself in a very Blade Runner/Cowboy Bebop-ish style, which clicks well with the fresh storyline and atmospheric music. It is clear that the dev draws inspiration from these two titles since he even mentions it in the included developer's commentary mode, and includes cameo appearences of the main Cowboy Bebop characters.  I very much enjoyed the puzzles, which are not overly complicated, but gradually become more challenging by cleverly combining the basic actions that are available to your character.

As it is expected, you explore the environment and interact with people and objects in order to solve puzzles and eventually proceed. There is also an item called the communicator which lets you communicate with various characters throughout the game but also provides you with all the necessary information and mission status.\n\nYou play the role of a man named Azriel who was an ex assassin but now has left his past behind him and works as an officer against the organized crime which is run by a mafia-like group called the Boryokudan. Your formal mission is to aid a man who later helps you on your true mission which is to acquire information about your lost brother Daniel. After infiltrating the Boryokudans and reaviling that there is a secret facility where people are sent there to have their memory whipped out and re-trained to become criminals and that your brother was sent there, you gather your crew and set a new mission, rescuing your brother.\n\nThe storyline despite being short is quite compelling and there are nice twists at the end as expected. The overall theme of the game is nicely expressed through the art style with retro like graphics and atmospheric music. However, I would really prefer it if instead the 16 bit overlay the visuals were a little more detailed. In comparison, the audio quality is really impressive for being an indie game. The audio logs are rich and clearly there was put a lot of effort into it. So, the audio and visuals are not side by side in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, Gemini Rue is a solid adventure game following the steps of the classic ones, yet it feels fresh and modernized. All friends of the adventure genre should definitely try out this game.","April 5, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A few are more tricky.\nI think game' story has some resemblance to Blade Runner, even music remembers me it from time to time. A detectivesque story with a surpresive twist at the end, well designed, with parallel characters that will meet together later.\nDon't let the old-school graphics to disapoint you, neither the user interface (specially the gun' system).

The puzzles are decent, the production values are all there, and the premise certainly sounds fascinating, doesn't it? How could I possibly dissuade you from purchasing and experiencing this promising sci-fi title?\n\nThing is, the story just fails to follow through. The "twin" plotlines resolve in the most obvious way possible (a development that is telegraphed HARD by the appearance/voice of a certain character), and possibly the most intriguing aspect of the story -- being an amnesiac in a prison of amnesiacs -- is similarly resolved in the least interesting way possible. I was very hyped to see what kind of intrigue this game would bring to the table; turns out it brings exactly zero. I hate to be the guy who says something is bad because it's predictable, but it really was that disappointing.\n\nI would be more lenient, because as I said it's well put together; art and atmosphere are solid, voice work and soundtrack are on point, etc. But there are similar games in the same genre and/or offered by the very same developer that are so much more satisfying in their storytelling (Technobabylon, for instance). Overall it is the most disappointing Wadjet Eye game I've bought, and that's coming from someone who's liked pretty much everything else they've put out.\n\nP.S.

It has all the hallmarks of classic games within the genre and is of a quality that puts some big-budget modern games to shame today.\n\nYou assume the role of two characters in this intertwining story;- Azriel Odin; a former assassin who is searching for his brother whilst looking for personal redemption for his past; and a mysterious hospital patient named 'Delta Six' who's memory has been wiped for reasons unknown. Your job is to collectively discover the secrets that exist in this bleak, corrupt and crime-riddled world and provide a resolution to your characters's plight. As the narrative develops and the story unfolds; you will be hooked. For such a simple 2D game; the story is truly absorbing along with the fully-voiced characters each with an intriguing personality.\n\nThe user interface is also extremely well implemented which is pivotal as this game demands complete precision in the execution of tasks and puzzles. It is incredibly complex at times and you will be forgiven for having to look up the occasional solution but it is a testament to the developers on how to create a challenging, thought-provoking and engrossing game.\n\nIf you're a veteran of the genre, a fan of adventure games or just looking for a story-driven title that offers a rewarding challenge; Gemini Rue is absolutely unmissable. It captures the essence of classic games perfectly and delivers a powerful and intriguing experience throughout.

The pixel animation is minimal (I spilled my drink laughing when I saw that an unconscious character was put on the table, not on the sofa, because I guess the devs didn't feel like to draw a lying character in the proper position for the sofa) and the pixel art is often smeared and out of focus. I would not recommend this Point & Click adventure game, because it's very boring and predictable. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604113003 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620720190 Unlocked all achievements!","February 10","false","8.1"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","12","28","0","3"

The graphics are horribly pixilated, just as games from that era were with audio and voice acting to make up for the lack of graphical attractiveness.  And it does make up for it in those areas, the characters have parts that are well written and well performed with a very human story to go alongside it.\n\nThe story is one I can appreciate.  The story follows two brothers, one trying to escape a station after having his memory wiped several times and the other trying to find the station and rescue his brother.  I liked it, the reveal happened a lot earlier than the real reveal and the major reveal becomes a lot more predictable the longer you go on through the game.  However, the writing is self-aware of its own predictability and manages use it as part of the build up -to the expected result- without insulting your intellect.  Instead of happening with an unexpected bang, it happens with a silent drone of acceptance, which I thought was what the author was trying to get and fits in with the environment they were building.\n\nMost adventure games tell stories of odd worlds and go out of the way to say how different this world is from the one we live in.  This game tries hard to explain the world with experience and view we can relate to, emphasizing the people without dwelling on the sci fi, dystopia, or technology.  From that standpoint, the game is a lot more serious than most of the games filling the adventure genre.\n\nThe UI and puzzles hold the experience back somewhat.  The puzzles follow the standard point and click or dialogue variety with some machine operation and event type obstacles alongside it.  The gunplay they added to the game was clunky and annoying to do.  It's easy once you manage to figure it out but it feels like something to pad the length of the game.  Some of the puzzles also have this feel, as if they were made just to lengthen the game by making you repeat content and without adding to immersion.  The UI also soured me.  It is not terrible, but some of the user unfriendly conventions of early adventure games were adopted alongside the art style.  I did have some problems trying to figure out how to use items in my inventory together, something infrequent in this game and I wish I gave more thought to the tooltip telling me how to do it the one time I had to during the game.\n\nIn all, I'd say it has the bones of a good adventure game and is at least as good as the games it emulates.  Unfortunately, the UI, gunplay, and some of the puzzles leave the experience feeling clunky.  A good find for adventure game fans, less so for everyone else.","February 14","false","6.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

There is a great amount of detail in the point-and-click interaction that gives a sense of realism to the world. I wish, however, that they had spent more time deveopping the setting and the characters. This is because the story is full of promise and philosophical intrigue, but falls very short due to the poor delivery that the somewhat shallow,predictable and underdevelopped cast dish out.

The writer apparently hasn't got an original thought in his head, but is very impressed with himself for having passed Philosophy 101. For a game that makes a big deal about free will, it's kind of ironic that there are literally no choices to be made, no story branches, nothing that you can do that will affect the plot in the slightest. At least most of the visuals are nice.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly pretty straightforward once you acquire the necessary items and information, but there's a lot of plodding around just picking up random crap wondering where it will come in handy. There are maps of a city that you're in for much of the game, but you can't even explore most of what it shows- you're a cop chasing leads, and literally everyone lives in TWO apartment buildings.\n\nThe game is also plagued by some serious bugs, which for some users could prevent them from running it at all, or cause crashes that prevent further progress. It took me quite a bit of research just to get it running, and then a lot of trial and error to get past one such bug, but I did manage to make it to the end. Not particularly glad I did. It's all very predictable, and incredibly preachy. Not recommended.","April 28","false","14.5"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","1","11","0","0"

The stories are often juvenile, puzzle solutions defy logic and the games themselves don’t have much adventure. The best I can do is say that Gemini Rue isn’t terrible but too many people here are going way overboard on their praise of this game.\n\nThe main reason to play adventure games (I think) is for the story. GR’s is a cut above most of what you’ll find in the adventure genre but it’s still not what I’d call “good”. It’s simply okay. Nothing particularly memorable, though there are at least a few twists thrown in.\n\nLikewise, I loathe navigating through the UIs in these games because they often turn simple tasks into complex ones because of poor design. GR has several moments like this, too, where you’ll know what has to be done but have to figure out the exact way the game prefers you do it.\n\nI will give it some points for puzzles at least having rational solutions instead of falling into the trap of “adventure game logic”. When you have to reach a ledge, for example, you’ll pull over a crate to stand on instead of throwing a rubber chicken at a cat who will get a dog to chase it who will knock over a vase which will startle a mule into kicking you up to the ledge. Again, though, it’s so annoying to have to point and click around to figure out the exact right combination of menu instructions to get up on the crate & climb up to the ledge. I’d much rather have a jump or climb button and be playing a different game.\n\nThe gunfight minigame is a nice diversion from all the pointing and clicking but is inferior to any action game. It was a fun challenge, at least, to get the Steam achievement for not getting hit once during them.\n\nThe graphics are retro, which means they are not so great and are around mid-1990s standards. Considering this, they at least do a good job of conveying the “dirty future” atmosphere the game is going for and set an appropriate mood.\n\nSo if you like adventure games, I’d say you will enjoy GR. If you aren’t crazy about the genre, though, you won’t find anything here to change your mind.","January 22, 2014","false","8.8"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","8","27","0","0"

The action is pretty basic, but provides a necessary aspect of danger to the game.\n\nIf you appreciate artsy, atmospheric games. If you appreciate noir and adventure. And If you can bear a few puzzles in between I'd strongly recommend this title. The puzzles themselves aren't usually major headscratchers either, but enough to contribute to making you feeling like a badass noir detective.

The big draw here is the noir science-fiction story.  A point/click adventure without a decent story is useless, and Gemini Rue is interesting if you are into futuristic urban dystopia.  There is a good bit of suspense, but also a lot of do-this-so-you-can-do-that linearity that will frustrate you if you get stuck, because there's nothing else you can do until you figure it out.  The best part of the game in my opinion was the part where you could switch between two characters, so if you did get stuck, at least you could switch to the other character's storyline until you were ready to go back and tackle the other point in which you were stuck.  Eventually it all comes together nicely with a satisfactory ending and some fun easter eggs along the way.  The voice acting and sound/music effects actually add to the suspense and game atmosphere, so that's a big plus.\n\nI am not a big fan of the pixelated art style, or my cursor getting momentarily stuck every time it ran into an edge of the screen (hit escape until the menu centers, and then hit it again - you should have your cursor back).  If you aren't into point/click, but the theme interests you, you should give Gemini Rue a go.  Don't know if I'd buy again, but recommended for a playthrough as a good change of pace from action games.","December 28, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll see some of the plot coming before it does, but the game raises some decent, Intro to Philosophy-level discussion material about what makes us all human.\n\nThe pixel backgrounds are gorgeous, and the soundtrack's apes Vangelis' Blade Runner score in all the right ways. Moody saxaphones back up Azriel's rain-soaked journey into his past; clinical synths bounce and settle underneath Delta-Six's retraining in the mysterious Center 7. Everything comes together to form the atmosphere that is perhaps Gemini Rue's strongest asset.\n\nGameplay-wise, the puzzles feel good and about as hard as they should. The combat mini-game isn't a high point--though it's neither frustrating. If you're an old hand with adventure games, you'll probably clear this in 4-6 hours.

Being a point-and-click games fan is a must, but I found the adventure provided by Gemini Rue very satisfying. This is a story about identity forging and what makes us who we are. All served in a noir sauce.

Soundtrack is awesome - game is fully voiced and the environmental sounds are realistic (voices sound different when heard through closed doors, for example)\n+ characters. The main protagonist feels like a comic version of Bruce Willis in the 80s (Last Boy Scout!), except he's living in 2229.\n+ introduction of characters. Meaning you might not immediately notice who will be very important in the future.\n+ dialogues. A bit of fun, a bit of violence, a bit of philosophy. An intriguing cocktail of feelings that makes you wanna keep playing.\n+ plot twists. nuff said here.\n+ easter egg characters. I didn't find them all - there's an achievement for that (the only cool one, see below)\n+ open world feel. Of course the game is very linear, but at certain points you get the feeling you could go everywhere - you just don't want to.\n\n-  graphics. They're just a tiny bit too pixely for a game of this millennium. At certain points there are overlapping errors.\n- playability. Had to google how to combine objects in the inventory. Also frantically scrolling around trying to see the cursor change and show anything you can interact with feels good once acomplished, but can be tedious when you're stuck.\n- achievements. Only for the hardcore because most of em are a joke: STAIR MASTER - use stairs instead of the elevator, srsly? It does not affect anything. Also, not getting hit in fights (see below) or finding ammo in an adventure game is just... meh...\n- gunfights and boxes (I mean crates, not boxing). They're like repetitive, useless mini-games no-one needs; not difficult, either. Feels good to kill a meanie with a headshot though (yes, the game does give that option).\n\nOverall, the pro's are outweighing the con's since they're very big and important pro's and tiny, non-essential con's.\n\nI highly recommend to any fan of point & click, to any fan of darker stories. Although not being replayable really I'll might give it another run (with dev commentary).\n\n","December 23, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is also the story of a nameless detainee in a mysterious facility where mind erasure and “re-education” are the rule. These two stories run side by side with players alternating between roles, filling in the narrative blanks until they finally come head to head during the game’s climax.\n\nAs for the writing, while some of Gemini Rue’s twists, motivations, and dialogue seem hackneyed at times, they can easily be written off as contribution to the game’s pulp roots. The gameplay is mostly solid, with a decent shooting mechanic for the “action” sequences and plenty of point-and-click puzzles to solve. My only gripe is that some clickable objects are very small, requiring one to play “hunt the pixel” in order to interact. More than once this caused me to overlook an otherwise obvious solution.\n\nIn the end, Gemini Rue turned out to be a pleasant experience and worth the investment. If you’re a fan of sci-fi noir, classic point-and-click adventure games, or both, you should consider checking it out.","December 23, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not the case.\n\nGR never ceases to be a coherent experience with its own logic and sense of freedom. Even when you're stuck, the game doesn't suddenly become a 2D background with several hotspots that you'll spend the next half an hour randomly combining with yourself and your junk. Puzzles never stand out but are an integral part of the story.\n\nGemini Rue is the game that I’d choose if asked to define adventure games.

Neo-noir style detective story that's definitely influenced heavily by Blade Runner. It's not a very hard game. I only got stuck for any length of time once. It took about 7 hours to finish. Graphics are very retro from around the early-mid 90's. The music was really well done and fit in well with the type of story and there is full voice acting. The main character sounds a lot like McGruff the Crime Dog and he even wears a trench coat  like him too. lolz. There are some lame action sequences involving ducking behind cover and shooting enemies as they pop out behind their cover. Thankfully, there weren't too many of those and they were easy enough. Opening and walking through doors was a bit clunky, but it's not a huge problem. Genre fans will like this game and newcomers might like too if they don't mind the old-school graphics It's on the easier side of p&c adventures and the solutions are logical enough.","November 12, 2011","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good story, but ugly. Not a must buy, but I think you should give it a try.\nMost importantly, do not bother watching the trailer. I think it does a poor job at selling the game.\n\n\nThe story, well written dialogue, and voice acting are the greatest aspects of the game. The story is noir style in a dystopian future. Not a masterpiece, but it kept me interested enough to want to play to the end. The story is told from two points of view. In a dark sombre future you play as a detective, piecing together clues to find your brother. In parallel, you play as "Delta-Six", an inmate in a mysterious prison-like facility, slowly uncovering its secrets, unsure who to trust.\n\nThe puzzles are not overly difficult: I never had to resort to a guide for help. One puzzle was particularly frustrating. It required the correct dialogue choices in a conversation. It felt more like trial and error than a logical puzzle.\n\nGraphics look old and blocky. The screenshots shown above are representative of the final product. Not a selling point of the game, but I did not mind.\n\nThere are some gunfights. I did not care for them, but they were well suited to the noir setting.\n\nThe UI is ... unique. Particularly, an odd design choice was to allow you to access your inventory only by right-clicking on an object in the game world. No biggie. Another annoyance is that when a second character follows you around, sometimes they might block an entrance/exit, e.g. a door.\n\nA greater annoyance is the save files of this game. When you start the game, you get a window with 2 options: either "play" the game, or "configure" the game's settings. If you choose "configure", you go to a new window where you find a button called "save and run". So those are the 2 ways to start up the game.  The problem is that, depending on which way you started the game, the location of the save files are different. For more information on this problem, look at the game's steam forums.\n\nI've played some indie games in the past that felt amateurish, as though it were a school project. For example, controls felt bad, or graphical eyesores when a character moves across the screen or when the camera pans across the scene. None of these problems manifested in the game.","February 18, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll see some of the plot coming before it does, but the game raises some decent, Intro to Philosophy-level discussion material about what makes us all human.\n\nThe pixel backgrounds are gorgeous, and the soundtrack's apes Vangelis' Blade Runner score in all the right ways. Moody saxaphones back up Azriel's rain-soaked journey into his past; clinical synths bounce and settle underneath Delta-Six's retraining in the mysterious Center 7. Everything comes together to form the atmosphere that is perhaps Gemini Rue's strongest asset.\n\nGameplay-wise, the puzzles feel good and about as hard as they should. The combat mini-game isn't a high point--though it's neither frustrating. If you're an old hand with adventure games, you'll probably clear this in 4-6 hours. At worst, 10.\n\nEnjoy it as you would a good book over a couple of rainy afternoons.","May 2, 2014","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The narrative was gripping, friendly characters were likable, and supporting characters all seemed like they belonged in the world and evoked the correct emotional response. The dark, rain drenched neo-noir setting is perfect for the story being told. Scenes were beautiful, the music fit superbly, the voice-acting was believable, and the sound effects were realistic. Is a person simply the sum of all experiences and outside input or is there more to a person? Gemini Rue explores identity, ethics, and even free will. Like all great pieces of fiction, which Gemini Rue definitely is, it'll leave you contemplating the questions it poses even if it doesn't offer a concrete answer.

This game was developed with Adventure Game Studio, so the graphics are extremely low resolution by any standard (320 x 200). In spite of this very low standard of graphics, the game plays very well. The point-and-click mechanics all work very well, you can interact with the environment, use inventory items, climb boxes and ladders, and engage in dialogs with characters. The main appeal of Gemini Rue is the sci-fi story. It is a very ambitious and dramatic story told without a hint of sarcasm. There are times when the story really pulls you in, which is the sign of a good story.\n\nThere are also times were the story falls flat, where you can tell that the writer is a very ambitious college student (Josh Nuernburger). For instance, Boryokudan means "violent gang" in Japanese, and is the official, boring name that Japanese police have given the Yakuza so they sound less romantic. It seems Mr. Nuernberger decided Japanese was cool and typed "mafia" into an online translator. The way this word is pronounced by the voice actors is also bad. "Boryokudan" is very difficult for an English speaker to say correctly, and the voice actors have merely pronounced the word as it is spelled, with no attempt at approximating the Japanese pronunciation.\n\nThe voice acting for the main characters is very good. Azriel (the main character) and the Director are excellent. For some of the lesser characters (the street vendor in particular) it seems that they just grabbed somebody off the street to read the lines.\n\nThere is some challenge to this game in terms of figuring out what is going on and what is the logical next action to take, so it is engaging without being too difficult. There are a few puzzles in the game but none that I got stuck on. There were two instances where I got stuck and consulted a walkthrough, but this won't be necessary for most people (I tend to get impatient). There are a few action sequences involving shooting which are very easy.\n\nOverall I would say this is an excellent game for people who like point-and-click adventures and sci-fi stories. While very enjoyable, tt is not a perfect game and the graphics and production can seem a little amateurish at times.","January 12, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has an involving story and unusually good use of pixelated retro graphics but is somewhat on the easy side.\n\nThe game is set in a dystopian future and features a story that starts our mysterious and gradually reveals more about what is going on. The story has philosophical aspects touching on the relationship between memories and personal identity although it doesn't really explore the subjects in any great detail. The story is the best aspect of the game and is helped by the fact that there are two branches of the story unravelling at the same, the two of which later converge. I found the story very appealing and it kept me wanting to keep playing to find out what would happen.\n\nThe pixelated graphics suit the atmosphere of the game very well and the visuals are nicely done. I think pixelated graphics have been overused in recent times, but here they are used to good effect.\n\nSound effects are adequate but nothing special, voice acting on the other hand is considerably above average and matches the personalities of the characters well.\n\nThe actual gameplay is the weakest aspect of the game. Puzzles are somewhat bland, not all that creative and mostly a bit too easy. The action sequences are nothing special and don't add much to the game. You could perhaps argue that in a strongly story driven game like this, having easy puzzles may be a good thing, as harder puzzles would only be frustrating when you want to make progress to find out how the story continues. Whether or not you accept that arugment I think that the somewhat lackluster gameplay pulls the game down a bit and keeps it from being the really great game that it could have been.\n\nAll in all this is a highly recommended game for all point and click adventure enthusiasts, ar least if you think a good well-told story is at least as important as good gameplay.","February 2, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Neo-noir style detective story that's definitely influenced heavily by Blade Runner. It's not a very hard game. I only got stuck for any length of time once. It took about 7 hours to finish.

The main character sounds a lot like McGruff the Crime Dog and he even wears a trench coat  like him too. lolz. There are some lame action sequences involving ducking behind cover and shooting enemies as they pop out behind their cover. Thankfully, there weren't too many of those and they were easy enough. Opening and walking through doors was a bit clunky, but it's not a huge problem. Genre fans will like this game and newcomers might like too if they don't mind the old-school graphics It's on the easier side of p&c adventures and the solutions are logical enough.","November 12, 2011","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could love the script and adore the graphics but the gameplay itself rarely left on me any impression whatsoever.

There are numerous games in which puzzles serve no more purpose than to slow the player down. This is not the case.\n\nGR never ceases to be a coherent experience with its own logic and sense of freedom. Even when you're stuck, the game doesn't suddenly become a 2D background with several hotspots that you'll spend the next half an hour randomly combining with yourself and your junk. Puzzles never stand out but are an integral part of the story.\n\nGemini Rue is the game that I’d choose if asked to define adventure games.

The voice acting is alright, and some of the puzzles could use a bit more clues but sifting through this Bladerunner-esque future world of gangs and brain washing brings about such yearning to play more that all those mistakes can be forgotten. If you want a great story and a little bit of change to the usual point and click, get this game.

Its a narative driven scifi noir piece that's punctuated by a series of logical puzzles using the enviroment, conversation, your inventory and an ingame wolrd database. The World is heavly inspired by noir scifi such as blade runner, akira or Renaissance, and each screen is oozing with atmostphere. Gemini Rue is a rare game that gets everything just right, every element complements each other perfectly; the graphics, charaterisation, setting, narative, interface, aethetic, sound, puzzles and pacing, all boils down to a game that knows exactly what tone of voice its projecting. If you ever get a day of uninterupted game time, i'd highly recommend this very well executed piece.","December 27, 2011","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I had troubles to even start it because it tried to use some obscure resolution which my TV couldn't handle. It took me a while on forums to find out that I have to turn on a compatibility mode for the exe file and limit the number of colors to 65536. Let me remind you this is not some old game, this was released in 2011. How the hell is this still not patched?\nAnd that's not all. Sometimes the game loses your saves and you have to manually move them from "\reslists\saves" to "\saves" directory to get them back. Also there are a few graphical glitches and characters in a distance have different resolution than the background.\nYet I'm giving it thumbs up. Because when you finally get it running, you get a pretty good old school adventure game in veins of classics from Lucas Arts and Sierra. It especially reminded me of Beneath the steel sky. Game actions make sense and the story overall is entertaining, only maybe the ending could have been a bit better.","July 11, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is stunning, the voice acting is on par with a couple exceptions, and the story itself is capitivating. However, the combat system can be a bit of a deterant for people. I personally quit the game and stopped playing for a while because I was getting frustrated. I picked this game up because I had been a really big fan of the Blackwell games and I had hoped Wadjet Eye had put a similiar amount of thought and dedication into the game and story and I wasn't disappointed. Other than the fact there are events that characters talk about and they aren't ever explained. That was frustrating for someone who relishes in the story and backstory and such.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who thinks that they might be interested in this game.

The cop part of the game is the best one. You also play as a young guy in a "test"-centre. This younger one isn't all that interesting to listen to with his "Okay" or "I don't know". And what he have to do isn't as fun neither. With the cop you get some really cool noir detective style gameplay and the interactive termianls works really well.\nI hope other games will put this kind of interaction in. To manually look through pc's or papers for names, phone numbers and adresses made me feel like I was atually doing some detective work, though in this game it's limited to terminal - but give me a game doing that, rather then having to figure out how 2 item needs to be combined.\nThe graphies are stylish-pixlated, which gives a very old school feel to the game. But I find it has a charm sharp hd don't have. Because they (to me) tend to look bland and plain; just boring (Sherlock Holms, Grabriel Knight remastered, ct...). While I would like to have better graphices these serve just fine.\nThe story of the game is interesting from the start and new things keeps happening that keeps moving it alone at a nice pace. The puzzle's are never too difficult, but in a few places I'm sure most people will get stuck for a little while. There are puzzles you simply cannot guess with logic, but instead have to just look around and try everything.\nThe movement of the characters are easy are fast enough, but sometimes they feel clunky. Also you have to use the keyboard for some movement which might irritate some of the most casual players. But again, the story and price of this game makes it worth for everyone to try out.","June 14, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is normally not a genre I'm a big fan of, but I was drawn to this game's sci-fi/noir setting. The voice acting is a little weak in places, but overall the performances are well done and add to the grim, "Blade Runner" feel to the game. The puzzles were never obtuse or lacking logic as sometimes plagues games in this genre, though the few combat sections did feel out of place and tedious.\n\nThe story is probably the high point of the game, and brings up some fun questions about what makes us who we are. Plus, it has a gritty detective searching for a missing person, rain-slick streets, a heavy-handed criminal syndicate, a mysterious facility where the patients are prisoners . . . if that sounds like fun, this is 7-8 hours of your time well spent.","July 6, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters, the story, the dystopian retro-cyberpunk setting and the clever, yet logical, puzzles all contribute to making this a beautiful adventure that deserves to be praised and regarded as a classic in the years to come.\n\nThe game also contains several easter eggs and secrets which, along with the branching dialogue paths in the story, the behind-the-scenes commentary, and the alternative solutions to puzzles, should contribute to its re-playability factor.\n\nThe only aspects that I find mar this otherwise flawless gem include the combat scenes (which feature quite heavily towards the end - yes, you can die), the inability to change the resolution from the in-game options menu (which led to some heavy pixellation on my 1920x1080 screen) and the lingering sense that your in-game decisions don't have a large effect on the conclusion of the story.","October 1, 2012","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The big draw here is the noir science-fiction story.  A point/click adventure without a decent story is useless, and Gemini Rue is interesting if you are into futuristic urban dystopia.  There is a good bit of suspense, but also a lot of do-this-so-you-can-do-that linearity that will frustrate you if you get stuck, because there's nothing else you can do until you figure it out.  The best part of the game in my opinion was the part where you could switch between two characters, so if you did get stuck, at least you could switch to the other character's storyline until you were ready to go back and tackle the other point in which you were stuck.  Eventually it all comes together nicely with a satisfactory ending and some fun easter eggs along the way.  The voice acting and sound/music effects actually add to the suspense and game atmosphere, so that's a big plus.\n\nI am not a big fan of the pixelated art style, or my cursor getting momentarily stuck every time it ran into an edge of the screen (hit escape until the menu centers, and then hit it again - you should have your cursor back).  If you aren't into point/click, but the theme interests you, you should give Gemini Rue a go.

Very Beneath a Steel Sky-esque, with a hint of Full Throttle (I'm not even sure why, but some parts of GR reminded me of some parts of FT). I really liked Gemini Rue.\n\nIt is not exempt from a few shortcomings: the controls and interface kinda suck, combat is God awful (not even sure why they felt the need to include combat at all: it really feels out of place), everyone relevant lives in the same one condo, there are not that many locations in the game.\n\nBut the good stuff vastly surpasses those. The atmosphere is just great, the visual design is excellent (hand-drawn, visible sketch lines, watercolour-y backdrops, big pixels for character sprints), the story flows well and the dialogue is quite well-written. The plot "twist" is introduced/hinted decently, and the "converging stories" device is also used fairly well. The music and voice acting also are top notch.\n\nOverall, Gemini Rue feels old school as ♥♥♥♥, in every respect: it is a greatly atmospheric and utterly enjoyable game that would have worked perfectly in 1994 as it does now.\n","March 16, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The interface is archaic and there are a lot of trial and error puzzles, as well as some pixel-hunty moments and kind of obscure puzzle solutions. Overall though the game design is pretty solid, although there's a gimmick of being able to switch between the two main characters at one point that is never necessary and that I never actually used, dunno why it was even there. There's also a kind of basic combat system put into the game but it's used sparingly which is probably for the better since I'm not a huge fan of it. The story is pretty decent and raises some good questions, although some of the plot twists I saw coming a mile away (not all of them though). The music is good and the atmosphere is good and it's an overall enjoyable experience. Recommended if you're a fan of adventure games although I would recommend the Blackwell series and especially Primordia over this game from the same publisher.","February 14, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally quit the game and stopped playing for a while because I was getting frustrated. I picked this game up because I had been a really big fan of the Blackwell games and I had hoped Wadjet Eye had put a similiar amount of thought and dedication into the game and story and I wasn't disappointed.

The combat to me feels rather cumbersome - I usually don't play point and clicks in one go due to the puzzle solving nature of it, so have combat in different parts of the game makes me go 'uhh what was I supposed to do again?'. After playing through the whole game and going through the second time, I revisited the tutorial and realized I've totally forgotten about the aiming bit (pressing control button to trigger an aim) and have been shooting blindly, although I managed to get through with my blind shooting. Dying isn't brutal as the game reloads from an auto-save point upon death (although it's better to have your own saves as well to lessen the steps between the auto-save point and the action).\n\nThis game has a 'hardcore' kinda feel to it, in a sense that it makes you do one step by step. Like if you wanted to open a door, you MUST walk near it and then open the door. However, I do like the fact you can kick things as well as addition to the normal 'see/talk/pick up' mechanic.\n\nThe voice acting is good, and I like the mood the game sets. The little touches in the game like how well animated the rain is, and the sound of the rain gets louder when you open the door to the rain outside is pretty immersive.\n\nDefinately a recommendable game if you like a decent storyline, atmospheric mood, decent voice acting despite dated and not-so-great graphics. If you do play this game, I encourage you to save alot as you can have different solutions to certain things in the game and missable acheivements.","March 14, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pacing can be very slow in some places, however this is fixed by the feature of skipping walking by pressing Esc.\n\nMost importantly for an adventure game, it is very satisfying to figure things out. The puzzles are all logical, and they encourage you to think, rather than trying everything out and clicking everything.\n\nThe length of the game surprised me, its +- 8 hours. To keep a game of this length engaging is quite an achievement.\n\nRecommendable if: you like adventure games and/or you like a good story and/or like the themes of noir and sci-fi.","April 15, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The cop part of the game is the best one. You also play as a young guy in a "test"-centre. This younger one isn't all that interesting to listen to with his "Okay" or "I don't know". And what he have to do isn't as fun neither. With the cop you get some really cool noir detective style gameplay and the interactive termianls works really well.\nI hope other games will put this kind of interaction in. To manually look through pc's or papers for names, phone numbers and adresses made me feel like I was atually doing some detective work, though in this game it's limited to terminal - but give me a game doing that, rather then having to figure out how 2 item needs to be combined.\nThe graphies are stylish-pixlated, which gives a very old school feel to the game. But I find it has a charm sharp hd don't have. Because they (to me) tend to look bland and plain; just boring (Sherlock Holms, Grabriel Knight remastered, ct...). While I would like to have better graphices these serve just fine.\nThe story of the game is interesting from the start and new things keeps happening that keeps moving it alone at a nice pace. The puzzle's are never too difficult, but in a few places I'm sure most people will get stuck for a little while. There are puzzles you simply cannot guess with logic, but instead have to just look around and try everything.\nThe movement of the characters are easy are fast enough, but sometimes they feel clunky. Also you have to use the keyboard for some movement which might irritate some of the most casual players. But again, the story and price of this game makes it worth for everyone to try out.","June 14, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is stunning, the voice acting is on par with a couple exceptions, and the story itself is capitivating. However, the combat system can be a bit of a deterant for people. I personally quit the game and stopped playing for a while because I was getting frustrated. I picked this game up because I had been a really big fan of the Blackwell games and I had hoped Wadjet Eye had put a similiar amount of thought and dedication into the game and story and I wasn't disappointed. Other than the fact there are events that characters talk about and they aren't ever explained. That was frustrating for someone who relishes in the story and backstory and such.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who thinks that they might be interested in this game.

I absolutely loved this game. Not only do you get to take on the (primary) role of a cop named Azriel Odin but you also get the opportunity to play as many other characters in a story that finds its way together from many seemingly unconnected strands. The only reason I warn you about playing this is because it's not a simple puzzle-solving investigatory game; it requires--it some cases--a LOT of thought, if you aren't following a guide that spells it all out for you. Not all of the puzzles are obvious, and most of them are much more difficult than you'd expect, ranging in difficulty from "no-brainer" to "it's been thirty-five minutes, what am I supposed to do with this thing?" Aside from one instance of faulty direction (you'll know what I mean when you get stuck on the lock-pick puzzle), the game is not to blame for your inability to solve the puzzle. It's to blame for forcing you to think outside the box, to examine every possible option, to go over all the things you might normally take for granted in the gaming world: in this instance, it requires you to pay close attention to details you've gained along the way. Everything is important to one degree or another and it bears mulling these details over time and again. Second, in the same vein as the aforementioned difficulty, this game makes you think--not just about puzzles but about the story, as well. I absolutely do not want to spoil this game for anyone who has an interest in playing it, so I'll refrain from citing any specifics. I think it is a very well-made game; I think it is a very important game for people to play, if they are willing to pay attention, think, and take something away from it, that is; and I think it's the kind of game that will make you almost forget you're playing it--it sort of sucks you in like a sci-fi space drama, but without all the added bull involving large scale galactic battles and strange species invading this planet or taking over that mining ship, etc. It focuses on the people and their stories, but above all, it speaks to the human condition in a profound way I've rarely seen in video games.\n\nI would whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who is willing to take the time to listen to what it has to say.","September 17, 2015","true","52.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game spruces up the traditional mechanics by adding slight touches of combat, standard detective sleuthing and other elements, among it's primiarly pixel-hunt littered narrative.\n\nWhile the graphics are in an old, pixel-based style, they are suitably grimy and dirty for the setting, which makes it work.  No amazing visuals to be found here but more of a classic look that kind of called my memory banks back to Shadowrun, Syndicate and other classic games.  The story is solid with some choice based dialogue and optional achievement objectives, but in reality this game is very straightforward.  It's all about figuring out what to find, where to use and thusly where to go.\n\nThe story itself was awesome and even though a few of the twists lingered in the back of my mind like, "Oh, that's who that is...that's what's happening," I still found myself pleasantly surprised here and there.  That whole begotten city, sci-fi touch really did give me fond memories of playing through Shadowrun SNES about 5 times in a row.  Some have complained about clunky gunplay but I was able to win every duel without a hit on medium difficulty on my second playthrough.  Could have probably done it on the first but was still learning the ropes.  The shooting/chase sequences helped to add variety to the standard puzzles and lengthy story expositions.  The thing about the game's story is that once it hooks you, it hooks you.  You'll want to find out what happens and then play it a second time to see if you can notice how things were going to play out.\n\nControlling two characters for a portion of the game was also a nice touch, and I enjoyed the fact that the majority of the gameplay in the two main locations was different enough that it further freshened up the experience.  Also pleasing was the fact that the majority of the dialogue was done with voice-acting, and even though an amateur team did the work, they did a pretty good job of bring the gruffness and vulnerability to the characters that required these different emotions.\n\nWith all of that said Gemini Rue isn't without its flaws.  It took me about 8-9 hours on the first playthrough examining every little thing and over-complicating the puzzles, but once you figure everything out as well as how to be a successful gun dueler, challenge is a pretty moot issue.  This game is not that tough.  My second playthrough was completed in barely 3 hours, so if you are a really keen player with adventure games (I'm a big rusty, getting my legs back), you have the potential to rip through this game pretty quickly.  Most of the times that you will get stuck is because you will completely overcomplicate the solutions.\n\nMore depth in the game would have been welcome...some different guns, some unique character attributes, ability to upgrade your skills, etc.  As a first outing this was not a problem, but there was definitely potential for this game to go in REALLY deep.  The experience as it was, wasn't shallow but at times you I felt like I was wishing for all of these other things to crop up in the training experiences which would become tools Azriel could use to complete his missions.  Still, it was mostly satisfying in the way the adventure unfolds and you'll want to keep playing to see just how things go down in the end.\n\nI'd like to write a longer review for this one but it's honestly a pretty simple, easy game with a complex story.  If you get stuck at any point, I guarantee it's because you are thinking about the puzzles too in-depth.  My second playthrough really illustrated to me how short and unchallenging this game really is.  I only missed one achievement and I didn't need a walkthrough to figure anything out.  Most of the times I was stuck was just me creating these elaborate solutions of how I needed to solve a problem.  With that said, Gemini Rue is definitely worth playing for point and click fans who enjoy some other accoutrements to that style of gameplay, yet I can't help but feel I played a game with so much more potential.  Hopefully, there will be a sequel and if so I will definitely support it.\n\nPros:\n\n-Cool, rundown sci-fi setting\n-Excellent story\n-Just enough variety to keep gameplay interesting (sleuthing, pixel hunts, shooting, chases, puzzles, etc.)\n-Strong sound design for an indie\n-You find yourself caring about the characters you meet\n-Easy to pick up and play\n-Addictive once you pick up and play\n\nCons:\n-Once you stop trying to be Einstein, the puzzles are EASY\n-Very short if you're on top of things\n-Not much challenge in combat, puzzles, or anywhere else\n-Graphical presentation sometimes hampers the finding of key objects/secrets\n-Overall feels to be lacking something...more combat choice...special character upgrades...something...\n-Besides steam achievements and commentary mode (which I tried to completel all of)...there really isn't much benefit of a 2nd playthrough.  Certain dialogue choices you made the first time, make little impact on the story by changing them the second time.\n\nOverall Rating:  7.5\n","September 23, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not very difficult or obscure in its puzzles, runs without a hitch most of the time (one rare layering issue and sometimes the graphics for half the screen vanish on relaod, but fixed by zoning).  Really the only things that were flawed about this game was that most of Azriel's playtime is focused on a single city intersection (making the game feel quite contained) and that its too short.  I would have liked a little exploration or sense of breadth to flesh out the environment, kind of like in the old PbC Sierra games I used to play.  Slight spoilers, but dialogue options are also mostly single-directional; no matter what you pick the outcome is the same.\n\nThere's enough lore here to make the setting believeable, and I quite liked that.   A few nods to the aforementioned Sierra games, as well as possibly one to Cowboy Bebop made me chuckle, and was appreciated.\n\nNot a bad game.

The combat to me feels rather cumbersome - I usually don't play point and clicks in one go due to the puzzle solving nature of it, so have combat in different parts of the game makes me go 'uhh what was I supposed to do again?'. After playing through the whole game and going through the second time, I revisited the tutorial and realized I've totally forgotten about the aiming bit (pressing control button to trigger an aim) and have been shooting blindly, although I managed to get through with my blind shooting. Dying isn't brutal as the game reloads from an auto-save point upon death (although it's better to have your own saves as well to lessen the steps between the auto-save point and the action).\n\nThis game has a 'hardcore' kinda feel to it, in a sense that it makes you do one step by step. Like if you wanted to open a door, you MUST walk near it and then open the door. However, I do like the fact you can kick things as well as addition to the normal 'see/talk/pick up' mechanic.\n\nThe voice acting is good, and I like the mood the game sets. The little touches in the game like how well animated the rain is, and the sound of the rain gets louder when you open the door to the rain outside is pretty immersive.\n\nDefinately a recommendable game if you like a decent storyline, atmospheric mood, decent voice acting despite dated and not-so-great graphics. If you do play this game, I encourage you to save alot as you can have different solutions to certain things in the game and missable acheivements.","March 14, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
