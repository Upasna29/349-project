Pier Solar and the Great Architects is defintiely one of those games. I previously owned only on my Sega Genesis and I absolutely loved it. The visual appeal, the great music, and the immersive story. The turned-based combat is also pretty refined compared to others in it's genre. Pier Solar HD is essentially the same game but with better visuals, a remastered soundtrack, and beautiful backgrounds that bring the world to life. To cut to the chase, if you like JRPGs or are looking for an experience, check out Pier Solar HD. If you enjoyed Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, or Final Fanstasy VI, you will love Pier Solar.","September 30, 2014","true","6.8"," 99 of 117 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","99","117","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Treidge/recommended/286220/","Treidge","Treidge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Treidge/","186 products in account","I was keeping my eyes on Pier Solar ever since it was known under the "Tavern RPG" codename, as many of fellow JRPG genre fans. Unfortunately, due to many reasons I missed the opportunity to play original Sega Genesis release (as many of us too, I believe) and was pretty excited to hear that Pier Solar will be coming to more platforms, including PC, and even with enhanced graphics and CD-quality soundtrack! "Now, that's pretty awesome chance to finally get to play this game", I thought, and when it hit the Steam — the game was bought without a second thinking. Now, when the game is cleared, it is a good time to sum up my experience with it.\n\nFirst of all, Pier Solar is a good game. I will not be original here, but if titles like Lunar Silver Star Story, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy IV-VI make echoes of nostalgic tremble in your hearth, then you should get Pier Solar. It has many qualities of a great game - wonderful characters, beautiful graphics and soundtrack, interesting story and an old-school JRPG charm.\n\nYou will be getting many random encounters with enemies (sometimes too many, he-he :D), looking for a treasure chests, crawl dungeons and oppose bosses. There's a bunch of fun dialogs out there, so keep talking with NPCs. Be aware that some of them have two and even three versions of replies to you, and sometimes it is necessary to talk with them three times to get an item or trigger some event.\n\nNow for the part that is not so good with Pier Solar. There's a few flaws in the game that may poison your experience - nothing too major, but still the game would be definitely better without them.\n\nSometimes you will get stuck.\n\nFirst of all, the environment design sometime will get you wondering where you should go. Yes, maze-like maps is classic for a JRPG, but there's more than that to well-designed map. I often caught myself missing the path to the next location or route to another area of current map just because it was looking like there's nothing interesting (dead end). Be prepared that if you feel that you got stuck and there's nowhere to go next - you should look more carefully for a path. Oh, and there's hidden paths inside the walls. Sometimes. Somewhere.\n\nSecond, the directions from the storytelling could be better. When you finish your quest in current location and should move to the next area, there was times for me when it was not so clear from the dialogs where should I go and what to do next. Most of the times you should just go to the next area, but there's few exceptions from this rule. Maybe I'm just getting too old...\n\nThird, the Sanctuary and the damned platform behind the pillar. Seriously, I will be making a small spoiler here, but when you will get stuck at this point in Sanctuary (couple of hours from the start of the game), look for a moving platform that is hiding behind the pillar near the room entrance ladder. I do not understand what was the point of making such design decision, but I'm taking it as a bad idea.\n\nIn general, "getting stuck" was the most annoying thing that happened to me with Pier Solar. When you wander from corner to corner of the map and face endless random encounters, getting ambushed often and the game is not so quick in its battle system - it is not long when you will get bored from it. My advice is such — don't hesitate to look for a guide or ask a question in forums, you will get much more pleasuring experience from this game actually progressing through the story, and not from lurking in forest or dungeon.\n\nWell, that's about it. I can recommend this game to any fan of JRPG genre.\n\nSome tips for the game that may be useful:\n\nThere's a detailed walkthrough by Tim Maurer at GameFAQs for this game. As was mentioned above, I advise to everyone who got stuck to take a peek on it (just in case :D).\n\nIf you played Pier Solar on Sega Genesis you may notice minor differences with this version. Same goes for the Tim Maurer's walkthrough — it was written for Genesis version of Pier Solar and contain very minor differences with PC version (you should get the Beaver in the forest).\n\nThere's nothing inside the regular barrels and crates (apart from very few hidden items in some special places), do not waste your time on them.\n\nSome walls can have hidden paths, look at the radar and to edges of the screen - if there's some graphics "in the middle of nowhere", most likely you can walk behind the wall to get there.\n\nSell unnecessary items (primary weapon and armor). The inventory system is very basic and you don't need a mess there.\n\nMetal and Gold Coins, blocks, etc. is money. Do not look for them in your inventory, after finding something like this in a treasure chest it will just add to your wallet.\n\nYou will get new spells at higher levels. Some spells can be learned only from the books.\n\nLook for the accessories that can halve elemental damage, they're very useful.\n\nHave fun and enjoy this game! :)","October 11, 2014","true","26.3"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","34","41","0","0"

"I don't like the way the heal spell looks" is one of them, which is obviously just nitpicking. Anyway, I absolutely love and recommend this game if you like JRPG type games. I've listed what I liked and disliked, and will update as I get further into the game.\n\nGood features:\n+ Stylish graphics, switch between HD or classic 16 bit look\n+ Great music, also able to switch to Sega Genesis sound\n+ Quick to get you into the game, very fun upbeat story\n+ Compatible with many controllers, even my SNES one!\n+ Adjustable encounter rate: fight more or no enemies at all\n+ Adjustable combat speed: great for when you're just training\n\nUnappealing features:\n- Steam overlay is bugged. Will move/select when typing.\n- The controls can be strange. Not game breaking.*\n\n* Holding a directional key seems to disable the use/talk button in the middle of dialog. When using a heal spell out of combat, there is a strange quirk where I have to hit the up button to scroll left, but the right button to scroll to the right. This is incredibly minor.\nALSO if you do have controller issues, right click the game on steam, go to properties, set launch options, and write dxjoy. This might make your controller more compatible. Be sure to map buttons once ingame of course.\n\nI'd like to add that games of this nature are very rare. The HD graphics have incredible, well-detailed environments with some classic 16 bit sprites mixed in. It's a timeless work of art; these visuals don't age and are very pleasant to look at. Give the demo a try if you are interested, and take into account that the bad reviews are only from a handful of people. If more people decided to try this game out, the ratings would likely go way up. In an oversaturated indie market, where some of the most lazy looking, blocky games are highly praised, I find it hard to accept that Pier Solar gets hardly any attention; it provides beautiful visuals, great music, a lovely story and classic RPG mechanics that are both intuitive and pretty satisfying.\n\n- Sarah","June 21, 2015","true","3.8"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

What do I mean by old school? it is turn based instead of the newer versions where you wait for a bar to fill and use x number of different attacks to use the bar meter.\n\nAlthough most people aren't here for the graphics, I would say they look fairly nice and updated which is always a plus.\n\nThe game works fine with the keyboard, but if you do plan on using a controller, I would suggest using the D-pad instead of the thumbsticks just because the movement seems a bit wonky with the thumbsticks.\n\nAlso just for anyone wondering, yes there are still black bars.\n\nFeel free to watch my first impressions video here: (first 30 minutes of gameplay spoilers)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcDdsOMKFsI","September 30, 2014","true","0.7"," 36 of 46 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","36","46","0","1"

If it's on sale, give it a shot.\n\nThough there is a timing/platforming section at the magic school which I hate, hate, hate.

I'm glad the guys at WaterMelon shared that opinion so strongly that they made their own.  While the game suffered through development hell (the original Genesis version from my understanding... as well as this HD version which I feel like I waited a year after the scheduled release date to check out), it finally came.  It managed to captivate me in the way RPGs did in my youth.  I honestly didn't think I was going to enjoy it that much.\n\nA few notes:\n- Battles are reminiscent of Lunar both in the way of style and challenge.  Areas can seem gimmicky and lack variety in fights up until a boss or change of region, however.\n- Sound is wonderful and fitting of the game's environments and mood.  Perfectly done in Genesis style.  The HD music is even better.\n- The options to swap between original graphics and HD, as well as original and HD sound are nice.\n- Without listing all the reasons, I feel the game has some replay value (I can see 1 or 2 more playthoughs in the future for mehself).  Obviously I'm not looking at it with nostalgia goggles either.\n- The characters are likeable, which is good due to the fact you'll be spending quite a few hours with them.\n\nOverall, I'd give it an 8 out of 10.  There's not too many great RPGs on the Genesis, so this game is  welcomed by me.  I'd even go as far as to place it at my number three spot of favorite Genesis RPGs, falling short of only Phantasy Star IV and Shining Force II.  If you're a fan of those titles and also Lunar, then definitely try to pick it up if ya see it on sale, and give it a shot.\n\nHappy Gaming, friends!!","January 29, 2015","true","27.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/recommended/286220/","NeoRizer","NeoRizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/","368 products in account","So I held off on reviewing this game until I was completely done with it so I could give a fair and proper judgement, this review is long and will cover mostly things I can't stand about the game. As a JRPG and RPG fanatic in general, I just can't justify telling people to go out and purchase or bother wasting their time playing this game because frankly, you're not missing out on anything at all.\n\nI'm not going to spoil any plot points in this review, but I will be spoiling elements of the game play and areas so you'll understand my frustrations.\n\nPlot\nIt's a fairly standard JRPG plot, it doesn't do anything remotely new or interesting and brings nothing to the table. Same old tired cliches you've seen before but I suppose they were just trying to recreate that nostalgia and archetype's from the golden years of gaming. The three mains are likable enough but the rest of the cast is just kind of there and I didn't really connect with their personalities or designs. The villains are standard garbage stereotypes, not even going to bother getting in to it... They rip off just about every Final Fantasy game in existance, which is just another testament to how unoriginal and uninspired it is.\n\nWorld Map / Game Structure / Pacing\nThis game's structure and pacing is a bit of an oddity as it just decides to switch up the formula about half way through. For the first half of the game you basically choose destinations by pressing left or right on the d-pad and it will cycle through the available locales. At about the half way mark the developers just decided to start linking all the dungeons and towns together so it all becomes one giant cluster♥♥♥♥ of a maze.\n\nSo you'll get a formula of Town - Dungeon - Side Town - Dungeon - Main Town - Side Dungeon Under Town - Warp to an entirely unrelated area with no way of going back - rinse and repeat for the rest of the game.\n\nIt becomes rather tiresome at the 90% mark when you have to walk through previously explored area's just so you can backtrack to pick up items you couldn't access before. There is a warp device given to you late in the game but it doesn't really help, it just allows you access to the previous "chapters" of the game that all seem to be separated by islands that are no longer linked together and must be accessed separately.\n\nThe worst feature of the warp device is that you can't just call upon it whenever you feel like, like the airship from Final Fantasy or the Flamme Drum from Secret of Mana... No you actually have to walk ALL the way back to the device and touch it on some arbitrarily placed square on one of the sides of it (it's different in each area) in order to continue on with the game.\n\nThis is what I'm talking about when I say the game requires A LOT of polish... Something this important shouldn't be overlooked... It's an essential part of the gameplay and it's confusing and obnoxious as hell to figure out due to lazy programming.\n\nCompletionist's Nightmare / Cryptic Secrets / Poor NPC placement\nIf you're one of those people who enjoy getting 100% completion rates in RPG's... just forget it. There isn't a solid guide on the web because this game is such a sleeper cult game... I can't even use the word "hit" in there because I don't even think it reached those kinds of sales numbers.\n\nEither way, all the secrets in this game are cryptic and obnoxious, invisible walls with zero tells... just start walking in to everything and hope you find something. There are treasure chests in unreachable places that MUST be opened with a spell from a distance... I found this was a major design flaw because some chests I didn't even bother walking to, I would just open them through walls. I found this to be incredibly lame and lazy.\n\nThere are hidden dungeons and items, most of which are missable and you can never return to. There are side quests hidden all over the place as well and some won't even open up until certain points in the plot which can be rather annoying... You could talk to everyone in the city but after you trigger a main plot event, the people you talked to could have a quest for you to embark on but you've missed it under the assumption those characters were just background objects filling the cities.\n\nThere's also a side quest and a main quest in this game where they place an important NPC against the same coloured backdrop so it's nearly impossible to spot it unless you literally stop in your tracks and scan the area with your eyes... It's probably because of how quickly the game moves when your characters are running... The Genesis was notorious for creating blurred backgrounds due to it's "superior blast processing" >.< LOL.... what a joke.\n\nJust be warned that you'll most likely never find everything in the game, I know I missed a dungeon and I couldn't return back to it because they give you a single opportunity to access it. I missed a side quest some where as well... and quite possibly a shop... even though I was incredibly thorough.\n\nGlitched achievements\nI found all the master keys, never got the achievement for doing so... even though I opened all 8 treasure chests with the ultimate gear. This leads me to believe the "Shop-a-Holic" achievement is also glitched, among some others. Again, more polish required.\n\nBattle System / Battle Pacing\nTerrible... just a terrible battle system. You have to "charge up" like Goku from DBZ so your characters can multiply their pitiful damage output and you have to have a full "gather" meter to use some of the best spells. If you so much as get hit before your turn comes up, you lose 1 gather and the spell is rendered ineffective. Your character will then miss their turn and spin around like a jack ♥♥♥ as to symbolize that they're confused. AWFUL DESIGN.\n\nThere's still hope though, you can give away your gather to other party members to help them use their OP attacks but at the cost of missing another characters turn for that round and what's worse, it's all or nothing... You can't just give away 1 or 2 gather... NOPE, you have to give away ALL of it...\n\nSo for example, a character requires 5 gather to use an ultimate special attack but the character only has 4, you can then request gather from another party member. However in the likely event that the member that you're requesting from has 5 gather... well you then proceed to steal all of it instead of just using some basic math... because apparently in this game 5 - 1 = 0.   :/    DUMB.\n\nYou'll get in to fights every 15 steps... Considering every dungeon in this game is a convoluted maze of eye tricks and illusionary walls, it's just an awful and frustrating mix. There's a spell that helps you avoid fights but it's literally only for about 45 steps and BAM, another fight. This means every 40 or so steps you have to recast the spell and watch some obnoxiously slow spell animation taking place... What ever happened to a symbol appearing next to your character's portrait to show you have some kind of spell effect active? Like come on...\n\nFor a game made for a system with "blast processing" it's the slowest and most annoyingly paced JRPG I've ever played in my life... I think I'd rather play Final Fantasy Anothology on the PSX with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu load times than have to deal with how this game's mechanics work. I'm not even going to talk about that menu that shows up every round of battle... oh wait, I just did... jesus man.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIt's a failed attempted at bringing a game as epic as Final Fantasy VI to the Sega Genesis platform and it just misses the mark on every single attempt... The game had a cool concept and appealing artwork but it ends there... Genesis was never a system for RPG's and I can see why now... No developer could smooth out all the kinks with menus and game structure... This game is a prime example of why all the big RPG developers chose the SNES.","November 15, 2014","false","20.6"," 127 of 219 people (58%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","58","127","219","10","0"

I had been looking forward to playing Pier Solar ever since I first heard about the game, so I was glad to see a digital version available for purchase on Steam.  The music and art are both excellent, but everything else about this game is horrible.  It's not a matter of taste or me just not liking the style---I'll give anything the benefit of the doubt and I would continue to do so for Pier Solar, but I just can't go on.\n\nHere's what's wrong with the game:\n1.  The game freezes often.\n2.  There are input problems when playing with a controller.  The developer suggested fix did nothing to help.\n3.  The combat system is awful and battle times can be measured in minutes (usually 2 or 3 for every battle).\n4.  The design of the maps is terrible.  Everything--including the towns--is like a maze.\n5.  Often, there are concealed paths or platforms behind what is visible to you on the screen.\n6.  The story moves at such a glacial pace that at 6 hours in, I still don't know what it is about.\n7.  Nothing in the game seems to fit together stylistically.  There is a real lack of cohesion and everything feels off.\n\nI didn't believe the negative reviews when I read them, because most of the points sounded minor on paper.  They really aren't.  Please learn from my mistake and avoid wasting your money on this game.  It is both frustrating and lifeless.  If you want to play a good classic game on the Sega Genesis (which is what Pier Solar was originally designed for), check out Phantasy Star IV.  If you want a unique JRPG that is a bit more modern, try The Legend of Heroes:  Trails in the Sky.","July 9, 2015","false","6.6"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","27","43","2","0"

It's a decent story with some awkward writing here and there, and it has a really lovely tileset (in most places) with atrocious layout. One of my issues with this game is some dungeons or towns just aren't straight forward enough. They feel to... maze-y. Not that that's a bad thing, it's just in most towns, when you barely know where your going, that causes problems. It doesn't help that in some cases, it's hard to tell where you can and can't walk. As I said though, the tile sets themselves are lovely.\n\nWhich brings us to another point. The tilesets are nice looking. the enhanced rendered visuals... not so much. The rendered version makes the background look like they were made in photoshop or illustrator, which would not be bad, had the characters themselves matched visually. But to be honest, it's sometimes harder to tell whats going on in the visuals with the rendered backgrounds. With the pixel art, it just pops out more.\n\nStory as I said isn't bad. I won't say anything on it, but I will say that some instances feel just as a matter of fact. One character joins because he/she just feels bad for you. Come on. And it's delivery (as far as I am anyway) just doesn't surprise. It's all extremely predictable.\n\nThe battles take forever... There is a system where you can charge up your energy to make attacks more powerful, but that takes up one full turn, and it opens you up to enemy attack. The saving grace is you can share your energy with your team mates, so that makes their attack even more powerful if everyone gives one to said team mate. The saving grace for that is there is a set up where you can turn off random encounters. I do this for exploring the dungeon, and grabbing chests. I use the battle system on mechanic strictly for grinding.\n\nAll in all, dispite how much of this game gets on my nerves, I still really like this game. I think it's mainly for the fact that I am bias towards 16bit style JRPGs. So I am going to recommend this game, but ONLY if you are a purist towards that style of game.","August 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sadly, I forgot to post it until now. Anyway, this will be a spoiler-free review of the game so that I can give people the idea of what I like and disliked about it.\n\nCharacters:  The characters have a plausible niche that feels like actual professions: One character is a botanist, another an inventor, and the last one is can read ancient scriptures due to living an archeologist life-style.  It is a bit refreshing to see such simple roles come to use during the game's narrative. Not just that, but the dialogue exchanged between the characters has a feel good tone to it.  In fact, even when you get a Game Over, the character dialogue exchange during the event put a smile to my face. It feels like the characters have life to them and you can tell that they've been best friends since childhood.\n\nGameplay:  So this is a love and hate for me. Let me go over the parts that I liked: The tutorial on how to battle was rather neat. I like the fact that the trainer gets you started in learning how the battle occurs. The 'gather' system is pretty unique in terms of being able to use spells and it is cool that you can pass it to your friends so that they can use their skill quickly. I like how you have an indication if your attack is good against enemies in the air or the ground. It is a nice change of pace for RPGs to know if you can strike in the air or not.  However, I will go over the gripes:  These are not intuitive in finding it.  Now, I think that may have been purposefully set so that you explore as the character, so I can overlook that. What I cannot overlook is the fact that it was not intuitive to know where or how the save point exists. There is a little pot somewhere that I found as the save point by chance. There was nothing that gave me the introduction to the save point or the concept of it. Again, I found that by chance, so that was a bit more annoying.\n\nGripes:  Cues/transitions. There are points where the game lacks it to where it gets annoying. Particular parts that I see are when people join the team, you don't get a cue when you are able to move again. One of the others are in various scenes, it feels like it ends abruptly. It's like you're expecting something to happen, but then the shift is '...Wait, that's it?' which I am not sure if it's because the transition needs to be slower or what. However, these are personal gripes.\n\nOverall:  I enjoy the game and I recommend people to snag it. Give it a chance, you may like it.\n","October 14, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ccBat/recommended/286220/","ccBat","ccBat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ccBat/","41 products in account","I like Pier Solar a lot, after logging for four hours so far. It's absolutely a game which seeks to capture a simpler time in RPG history--games like Lunar for the SegaCD, and Final Fantasy IV for the Super Nintendo come to mind. This early-'90s period is my favorite for the RPG genre, and I still regularly play my old favorites from 1989 - 1994 via emulation. It's great to have a "new" game that hits the same notes, albeit, with some more panache in the graphics department.\n\nSpeaking of the new "HD" graphics, I have to say they are beautiful, and stylistically a good match to the pixel art of the 16-bit graphics set of this game, however, they often get in the way of my gameplay. I've gotten in the habbit of enabling the HD graphics for towns and then disabling them for dungeons because the pathways in dungeons are a lot harder to see with the paint-over versions of those backgrounds. This is even after the recent "pathway decluttering" that I see touted in the update notes.\n\nIn the case of both the 16-bit and "HD" graphics, pathways could still be a lot clearer, and there could be fewer obstacles to pathways around towns, etc. It's frustrating to realize that my character can't move forward because he is blocked by a flower, etc. There are also rare instances where a tile of the game is set to non-passable even though it is clearly a pathway tile, same as others in a series. Those instances are rare, and not hard to find my way around, but it's frustrating to navigate. Disabling the "auto-corner" behavior of characters actually made controls a lot easier for me. It used to be so frustrating that they'd hit a corner and then slip around it to someplace I didn't intend. If I had my ultimate way with things, I'd remove auto-cornering as a default behavior and clear a lot of obstacles from paths that are supposed to be passable. I think in that way I'd take this awesome game from a 80% enjoyment level to something like a 95%. The frustration in those cases I describe is not necessary, and doesn't seem like an intentional gameplay element.\n\nBattles are pretty fun. I really like the "Gather" mechanic, as a whole. I like that characters can take and send each other's "Gather" energy as well. Leveling takes a while, but I'm okay with that. My old faves were also something of a grind.\n\nCharacter art is definitely on tone for the period. I'm a fan of the '90s anime look, and the character art in Pier Solar hits that look very well, most of the time. The cinematic artist seems to have some hangups around cloth drapery and anatomy that rear up and get distracting from time to time, but I wouldn't have hired a different artist. I think the tone is dead-on and the little foibles are forgivable when they happen. I had some of the same misgivings about some of the cinematics in the original Lunar game for SegaCD. Interestingly, the pixel art versions of these assets seem to work better, as a whole.\n\nThe soundtrack by Zable Fahr, Tulio Adriano, and Tiido Priimägi is another case where I really appreciate the work that has gone into the "HD" version, akin to a CD audio soundtrack on a CD-ROM game, but there are times when I miss the crispness of the FM console synth version. There are times when the CD audio version sounds a little mushy where I don't think it's intentional.\n\nThis is all stuff you only really notice when you LOVE a game, so I'm pretty sure I LOVE 'Pier Solar and the Great Architects.' I intend to play it all the way through to the end.\n\nIt's easy to nitpick a game like this and hold it up against games built by much larger teams with a lot more money. That's a testament to how well Pier Solar hits that bar, even though it was largely a labor of love. That Kickstarter money they got was not at all a decent budget for a game of this scope, with all the intended target platforms. I'm glad we have the game, as is, on Steam.\n\nI would easily recommend it to anyone who enjoys 16-bit RPGs. Bare in mind that you can flip back and forth between the 16-bit and HD versions of the game's visual and audo assets.","November 7, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I play games like Beyond the Beyond (which is pretty bad but manageable)  and the old school FFs and I can tell you this remake of an old Sega game is the worst piece of SH*T I have ever played in the RPG genre. The enemies pretty much stay the same though out the whole game, the pacing is crap, the story is uninteresting and the characters are terrible. The interface is clunky at best and you will spend almost all your money buying a few healing herbs from some vendor when each town has multiple vendors all at different prices which doesn't even matter because you will spend all your money anyway.\n\nThe game starts out with some promise but after the first town or two you get roped into a mysterious series of events which do not explain much. A drag through the middle of the game will leave you frustrated from long dungeons and uninterested about the points of the story probably because you will forget the reasons you were there in the first place.

After all, that's usually what convinces you to buy a game.  If the game doesn't live up to that hype, then you were cheated out of your money.\n\nPier Solar, while not a terrible game, doesn't live up to that hype.\n\nThe biggest hype of Pier Solar is that it is a port of a Genesis/Megadrive game.  Forget it, that has no factor here.  The graphics have all been updated so it looks like any other decent RPG Maker game.  The story never was up to snuff of genesis RPGs.  The FM based sound is the only thing that's left, but it's not on by default, so I guess even the developers didn't think that you would prefer the 16-bit version.\n\nSo the graphics are decent.  I don't need to explain that because there are screenshots, what you see is what you get.  But what's wrong with the story?  Well, I don't know entirely because I haven't played the whole thing, but after 6 hours I'm not sure if I want to play through the whole thing.  There has been zero real motivation.  The first chapter has been about finding a plant to heal the main's dad.  That's decent motivation for the characters, but I just met these people and have no reason to feel involved.  That part's over, so then they introduced a door that teleports you to a green room, we went to Pakistan, and now there are some furries.  That's neat, but there's nothing compelling about any of it.  Our heros are just exploring out of passing curiosity, just like me, and I don't think I have the stamina that they do.  Speaking of heros, I've spent 6 hours with the same 3 people and I don't dare try to spell their names without looking it up.  They are not compelling characters.  They are all young scientists who are good with weapons and magic.  If they could change weapon/element types, they might as well have been all the same character.  JRPG's are supposed to be deep and compelling, and that hasn't happened yet.\n\nEverything else is pretty typical.  The battle system has a neat "gather" feature which acts as a multiplier while fighting.  Required for certain spells.  That's the only thing that seems worth mentioning.  Battles are actually rather simplistic because you can't seem to share elemental powers between characters.  Eg: fire based weapons are only available for the fire based character.  The overworld also has the typical "get stuck on corners/can't tell what is or isn't a wall" features that you expect from RPG Maker games.\n\nYou can't expect Phantasy Star out of every retro tribute game, and WaterMelon made a lot of effort for a comparable 16-bit game.  Without the 16-bit hardware, however, Pier Solar is just another of the many fan made RPGs on Steam.","August 16, 2015","false","5.4"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","2","9","0","0"

But they did not redo any char models or item textures as far as I can tell.  The latter seem really muddy.\n\nAlso they seemingly did no work on the audio side of the game.  They recently added an option to lower SFX volume but it doesn't make up for the low quality of the SFX, just hides them.  Some sounds are incredibly loud for no reason, randomly, and will scare the crap out of you. Battle sounds are terrible, like nails scratching across a chalk board.\n\nAlso for any migraine or seizure sufferers.  The spell animations were not updated either.  So there is low effort screen flashing going on that might trigger your illness.

For some who want mainly Role-Playing aspects, meh, fine. But you should really make it versatile to allow skipping so people who don't care about the story can skip it. Even being forced to read all of the dialogue, the controls are gimmicky and probably one of the weakest choices for assignment I've seen, paired with nothing but story line to go off of for early progression. You don't need a tutorial, just literally like one minor hint as to what to do would be enough, rather than just hoping to accidentally figure it out.\n\nI am only interested in combat, so my review is based strictly on that. As of yet, I have experienced no combat in the first 15 minutes, which instantly makes me lose interest. There are two kinds of players, Role Players and Combatants, and some are both. Your game is too based on Role Playing that you lose 50% of your player base simply because you don't introduce combat early on. Many RPG games such as this begin the game with a Role Play scenario of a combat scene, giving both players a taste of what they're interested in. But, this game, you forego that and completely lose us Combatants by a slow and bland story line that we cannot skip to hope to get to combat sooner. I really want to see how combat plays out, but it honestly is not even worth getting there with how crappy the story is. If it was able to be skipped, and gave a quick 10-second hint at how to play, then it would be golden. About one day of work and you effectively increase your player population by double. But, obviously that isn't worth it, or the developer's didn't care enough and just wanted a Role Playing game.\n\nTL;DR:\nIf you enjoy slow Role-Playing story-based games, you may be interested\nIf you enjoy combat in RPGs, save your money, but more importantly your time. 15 minutes into a game and no combat is too long. I feel like I just read the Terms and Conditions for a game before I even logged in.\n\n15-minutes of play Rating: 3/10\nNot worth swallowing the bile to go farther, save your money.","May 18, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 20 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","2","20","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kishimura/recommended/286220/","Kishimura","Kishi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kishimura/","806 products in account","As an old-school gamer back in the 8-bit/16-bit era, I never heard of this project until someone showed me their kickstarter  page in 2012 to put it onto modern consoles and devices. The presentation video blew me away with their excellent HD art and audio, let alone the amazing quality of the standard Mega Drive graphics and FM music too. It's a great first impression and, despite some nuisances in the game design, I enjoyed the time I had playing Pier Solar and the Great Architects.\n\nThe good stuff about the game is pretty clear from the store page that you've just glanced over. It has some fantastic pixel art, presented in 3 different formats: 16-bit, HD, and HD+. I would recommend either 16-bit or HD. "HD+" looks just like HD but it smoothed over certain layers and doesn't seem to fit well with the other sprites. The animations are all well done for the most part too, considering this is a Genesis/Mega Drive title. Speaking of which, the music is equally satisfying in both the FM (Genesis/Mega Drive) and PCM (HD, dare I say it's MIDI?) formats. The music captures the mood fairly well in their respective sections of the game (jungle theme with repetitive drum beats and bamboo flute, check) and also have a catchy melody that you'll definitely be humming with. I initially disliked the music, but as I played more and did a quick 2nd play-through, I enjoyed it more. The boss battle themes are excellent!\n\nNow, the "eh" section. The game draws some stereotypical cliches for JRPGs as you would expect. The main character, Hoston, is a 16 year old sword-wielding botanist, Alina is a 16 year old archer/mage elf(?) that happens to be the perky, older sister-like childhood friend, and Edessot, the 13 year old mad scientist that uses gadget-y weapons. He can also toss stones, bombs, and dynamites at enemies too. You'll meet three other characters along the way to help them fight the good fight. The story is quite interesting, but also confusing as well. A lot of questionable philosophical decisions will suddenly be thrust upon the characters later in the game that will make your head scratch. You can blame the poor pacing for that. The dialogue throughout the game was entertaining and even funny for the most part. I did have the issue of face-palming myself and saying "oh c'mon, it's so obvious who that person is..." a few times and when Alina, your childhood elf friend with point-y ears, suddenly announces that she and her parents, who are clearly human with their round ears, are unrelated and the rest of the party is shocked to hear about it.\n\nThe battles in this game are quite repetitive, but what RPG isn't these days, really? You have the typical attack, spells, defend/cover/counter, items, and a "Gather", which is like a power boost, maxing out at 5. The most powerful spells will require 5 gathers, but, not only that, the amount of Gathers also increases the character's power too. 5 Gathers grants a 4x damage increase to all attacks and healing abilities, so maxing that out in boss battles is crucial. Problem is, the characters will lose those Gathers as they are hit by enemy attacks and, if you happen to use a spell or attack that required 5, but they're at 4 after the attack, they just spin and do nothing that round. Characters also lose those Gathers after the battle is over, so you'll constantly have to build them up every battle. Overall, I found the battles to be rather easy due to the elemental attacks that most enemies have and the ability to equip elemental accessories to halve their damage throughout the game, including the bosses! Feathers, Towels, Dragon Tooth, and Weights are your best friend! (+ Vaccines in the end game)\n\nNow the bad stuff...\n-Unskippable opening & ending credits\nThe opening isn't a problem, but the ending credits....IT'S 30+ MINUTES LONG, HALF OF THAT IS KICKSTARTER BACKERS. You have to sit through this in order to do a New Game+ too!\n-"Path-finding"\nThe movement in this game pretty bad, so I can see why there's a "Path-finding" option available. Turned on, it automatically bypasses solid (non-passable objects) by going around them without you having to move around it yourself. The AI for this is a bit awkward to grasp, so I personally turned this off.\n-Map layout + passable/non-passable objects\nAnother problem is the graphics. Wait, what!? I thought I said the graphics were fantastic?! Well, yes, but the problem is differentiating what is passable and what is not. If I see a small stone or flower on the ground that I believe should be passable, then that's what should happen. But guess what? It isn't. The game is FULL of these little nuisances, so you either deal with the awkwardness of enabling pathfinder or go around them yourself. Slow NPCs that move randomly in places with one tile width need to be passable, which they are, but only if they're going the opposite way from the direction you're going. Not to mention, the map design is cluttered everywhere you go, towns and dungeons alike. It's like the whole game is one huge maze for you figure out.\n-Different option menus\nThere's technically 4 different option menus depending on where you're at. The title screen has the main option menu that allows the player to change controls and handle save files (copy-paste & delete), among other things. You can also do the majority of those in the game outside of battle, minus changing the controls, but you can change the encounter rate from 0 to 8 (1 is default). Once you get Edessot in your party, you can setup an auto-save function through ANOTHER option menu, plus enabling a chest radar, map, and even a warp back to the map entrance. Oh, there's also a different option menu in battles too! This one allows you to change the animation speeds (this is a must, max it out) and AI for the auto battle (BTW, read below on how that doesn't even work at all). Why not just make everything available in all menus?!\n-Battle animation speed, outside spell animation speed, and auto battle AI\nRemember the animation speed I mentioned just above? The default speed is horrendously long and drawn out, so you'll bump that to 4x after a couple of battles. Sadly, the spell animations OUTSIDE of battle cannot be sped up, but they're not too long, still annoying though when you're trying to use heal spells on your party.\nNow, that AI for the auto battle? Some people say it's broken, but I've noticed some things they don't quite understand. The AI allows 4 settings on or off for auto battle: Attack, Spells, Gather, and Items. If you turn Gather off and turn Attack and Spells on, your characters will still Gather. Why? Because they have attacks and spells that require Gather in order to use. If you turn Items off and turn Attack on, Edessot will still use his throwing items to attack, because those items are required in order to use those attacks. So what's the point of allowing the players to enable or turn off certain actions when they won't work as it's stated? Why not have a option of "All Basic Attack only" so that the characters are not defending or gathering for a stronger attack type when I'm facing enemies that are all one-shots to defeat?\n-Multiple items with the same effects\nDon't do this in any RPG you create, please.\n-Bugs/Glitches\nThere are some I've heard from some users out there. I had one game-breaker in Assac when Zellini/"Bounty" is suppose to find a new boat to Ludon City and she gets caught in the way of a NPC, forcing me to restart the game from the last save.\n-Eternal Slip\nI may be an Eternal Slip god, but ♥♥♥♥ this mini-game. You've been warned. Prepare for many long hours to finish this.\n\nWhen I began this game, I was looking at giving it a 5/10, but after finishing it 100%, I'm giving it a generous 7/10. I recommend it to old-school JRPG players that liked Lunar & Phantasy Star.","April 21","true","35.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
