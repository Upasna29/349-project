"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowAngel/recommended/370240/","ShadowAngel","ShadowAngel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowAngel/","753 products in account","I gave  2K15 a good review and that was after a couple Patches that made the game usable. 2K16 came around and it's the same engine, basically the same game but with a ton more flaws and issues and i don't know how that is even possible. I mean in 2K15 for example the Lakers had their real arena light, that means, all the lights on court while the crowd area is darkend. In 2K16 it's the same bright lit arena like everywhere.\n\nBut that's just one of the more superficial flaws this game has.\nSo far i encountered:\n- During Games the commentators stop working, that was a problem in 2K15 but is even worse here now with the commentators stop all the time, in every match be it a mycareer match, a online match, myteam match, all the time\n- Sound effects and Music also stop, you play one match in Mypark with the Music, all sound effects and the next match you only have the sound effects of Park itself, like the Bird and Sea sounds on the Park or the Steel mill sounds on the Rough Riders Park but you won't hear the players, the ball or anything else.\nNow of course one could argue that sound is just one thing but there are many other problems\n- Invisible players, that happens everywhere be it the park or an offline game, sometimes player get invisible but they still play, making points and everything\n- You get fouled out (6 fouls) but you can still play\n- Players shoot at the wrong hoop (happens with the AI)\n- AI players don't know how to behave and resemble more a bunch of scared chickens\nThere are more issues all around, i have a screenshot of the Store where rings are displayed as pants, that's not fixed one month later.\n- Random crashes, unable to invite friends, connection problems, disconnections in the MyPark, connection errors (including crash to desktop) on MyCourt when you invite friends do exist. 2K's servers are notoriously bad and have been bad for the past few years over console generations and now on the PC. It's baffling they don't fix their crap which leads me to the next point:\n- Microtransactions. With 2K15 2K introduced  VC to the game, you earn VC by playing matches, be it online, mycareer, mypark or whatever which you can invest in shoes, jerseys, shorts or use on the MyTeam mode as with always, microtransactions on a game that costs 50€ (at least, the MJ edition was 69,99€) is questionable, while you can earn them, you can buy them with real money and 2K this year made sure you can't get enough VC without paying for them. MyTeam has Card Packs that cost 7.500 VC, there are shoes up to 15.000 VC, Jerseys up to 5.000 VC and regardless if you unlock shoe contracts or not, the shoes you design yourself in the main menu outside the career cost you 7.500 VC, regardles of a shoe contract and if you want to proudly display the jersey of your team you play in career in the online park you need to get to a certain park reputation and on top of it, the jersey is another 5.000 VC. Last year those Team Jerseys in the Park were free, now even for that 2K wants your money.\n\nThe positive things, are the new things: Team relocation in MyGM and MyLeague are fun and in MyTeam you can use the same features about getting your own Logo (better make sure to not use any trademarked stuff becuase apparently even using and old Team logo that is not available can get you banned and the game only supplies you with the regular 30 NBA Team Logos, despite having classic logos and jerseys available in MyTeam but you're not allowed to use them in MyGM/MyLeague, so you can upload them yourself but you risk getting banned because it is actually a breach of their TOS)\nSpeaking of MyTeam, it's a grind through hundreds of the same cards and the same old challenges, in fact, it was a lot more fun last year where you could chose between Current and Classic Team Packs, now you only have 3 current packs and at the moment a Rookie Card Pack that can net you anything from a rookie to a silver to an amethyst card pack but most of the time you get the same guys over and over, i got 3 times the same blake griffin rookie of the year card. It's like the game is trolling you and just wants you to waste your MT Points or VC on crap.\n\nTalking about that i want to mention more bugs people had:\n- No Keyboard support, while i think playing a sports game on Keyboard (i haven't done that since FIFA 96 personally) is kinda dumb, i think a PC game should support the Keyboard. NBA 2K16 doesn't really, you can't configure keys and the pre-made layout is apparently made for aliens with 3 arms and several more fingers\n- In MyCareer you might receive MyTeam Cards through connections...at least that's the theory. I unlocked a few, never got the cards\n- Same with the rival day on MyPark, the second week me and some friends helped the Sunset Beach securing a victory and despite constant "Claim your reward on the kiosk" messages, we never got the promised VC and reduction of Boosts.\n\nAnd now we come to the big hype this year: Livin' da Dream - A Spike Lee Joint\nThe premise is actually fun: You start in High School, play College and then go to the NBA. Certainly better than the "Not getting drafted story from last year" but:\nYou can't really customize your player, you are from Harlem, your nickname is Frequency Vibrations, shortened to Freq and you're basically forced to create a black player because otherwise it's absurd to have black parents and a black twin sister.\nSo you start in High School which consists of 3 games followed by College (you can select 1 of 9 colleges but it makes no real change at all) which lasts for 4 Games and after than you're in the NBA, after you got drafted your rookie season consists of 8 games (and 1 playoff match, if you're lucky) while the rest is simulated. The game actually acts like you should have a choice, like teasing a decision about wether you do a second college year or go straight to the NBA or later "state your oppinion about your shoes" which was mistaken by many to be a shoe deal which it isn't, it's just cutscenes you have no influences whatsoever and most of those scenes drag on for too long (some are over 10 minutes) and you sit there and wonder "is this a badly written movie or am i still playing a game?" only to realize "i'm stuck in a badly written story full of cliche, annoying (and sometimes racist) characters and plot holes (like your player constantly switching between a 3 time and a 4 time all-american) in a game full of bugs that make me play matches for the sake of seeing more stupid soap opera like cutscenes"\nOnce your after the rookie season you start MyCareer but it's still not your Career as mentioned above, you can select a "secondary nickname" but the PA and the Announcers as well as the Pre- and Post-Game Show still call you Freq all the time. It's highly annoying.\n\nI could go on and on with the flaws, how 2KTV makes the game crash at random times in the main menu, the performance is abysmal because it's a very badly optimized game, how disconnections, crashes, glitches and limitations hinder everything and 2K doesn't care and of course how the online mode is filled with cheater on the park or the obnoxious ce-quitters in myteam and of course that even the music while being a great diverse soundtrack with various styles and some truly great songs is censored to the point where songs consist of mostly audio drop outss, the worst example being NAS - Made you Look which is so horribly butchered that the finaly 10 seconds only consist of the word spit because everything else is erased because it contains "filthy words".\n\nSo all in all, while the basis of the game is still a good basketball game, it has too many bugs, glitches, flaws, cheaters with 2K apprently only caring about saving their precious microtransactions and nothing else. So all i can say, is: Don't buy the game and don't support 2K because they simply don't care.","October 22, 2015","false","199.5"," 624 of 726 people (86%) found this review helpful 62 people found this review funny","86","624","726","62","32"

Spike Lee's My Career. I have a big problem with being forced to be black for the story to make sense. Not because there's anything bad about being black (full disclosure: I'm a black man), but because its lazy writing. Spike seems to want to tell his story of a struggling black kid from Harlem, New York making it to the NBA. That's great for a movie, but this is supposed to be a game. And the best games give the player the most choices. Choices are why Western RPGs like Dragon Age:Inquisition & Skyrim are more popular right now than Japanese RPGs that force you to play through a bunch of set pieces as their stock protagonist. I'm opposed to any game mode that removes choice from players, especially when those choices existed in last year's game.\n\nWith that out of the way, NBA 2K16's gameplay has improved over the past two iterations. Defense is more effective & physical. You can't just bully your way into the post with a random SF anymore. Shot selection seems to be even more important this year & fastbreaks actually seem fast this year. The 2K Shop, however, is another matter. They're selling virtual Gatorade now?!? C'mon man...that's just a blatant cash grab. Everything costs VC this year. Designing your court would be great if they didn't nickel & dime you to death for accessories. I know that you can earn some things through My Career, but its still ridiculous to charge 500 VC for different colored nets.\n\nOverall, I enjoy the gameplay more than ever. But 2K needs to stop letting outsiders write stories for games & be a bit less greedy next year. Pick this up now if you're absolutely addicted to sports games. Otherwise, catch it on the next Steam sale.","October 1, 2015","false","293.9"," 501 of 597 people (84%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","84","501","597","39","22"

This game proved to me that my assumptions about Spike Lee were correct. He cant write a good story, the only city in this mans mind is New York, and there is only 1 race in Spikes world, Black.\n\nIf you enjoy personal player customization, than this game is NOT for you. Pike Lee stereotyped this game all over the place, if your Asian, Russian, White, Mexican, etc, than im sorry, but according to this game, your now African American, but you can choose what shade of African American, so thats good I guess. There is only 1 voice for your charactor. If you try to make your charactor look as much like another ethnic group as possible, you then have to deal with the fact you have a black family, which is fine, I can do the adopted thing, but wait, you have a twin sister who is also black. Now, your name, you'd probably like to have your very own name wouldnt you, too bad, you are now known as "Freq", which is short for Frequency Vibrations. Oh ya, you live in the projects in Harlem, nowhere else, you cant choose LA, Houston, Canada, London, nope, its Harlem. Your best friend is a drugged out loud mouth, your sister wont give you any privacy. How about choosing a college to goto, that you can do, aslong as your favorite school is 1 of the 8 they give you to choose from.\n\nNow, im not saying thoe entire game is junk, its not, infact the only part of the game thats junk is the MyCareer mode, all the other aspects of the game are fine. Well, except for those who pre-ordered the game and didnt get what was promised for those who pre-ordered, ugh!","September 27, 2015","false","10.6"," 441 of 549 people (80%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","80","441","549","87","40"

The biggest problem I have with this was the absolute heavy-ham-handed scripting which instead of adding to immersion actually kills it completely.\n\nFirstly, My Career has always been about creating a player that is you (or that you want) regardless of race. Spike Lee pigeon-holes and shoe-horns you into poor black kid growing up in the projects in Harlem. Cliched much?\n\nMy Career tries to present two of the fundamental choices/problems that blue-chip college/young NBA players have: such as whether or not to go one-and-done; whether or not to stick with your homie who's had your back forever but is a bad influence or to ditch him for the good of your career.\n\nSo much is made about these problems and how hard it is to choose. Your character literally agonizes over each choice. Then the game/story goes ahead and makes the choices for you. Well duh ... if you're going to belabour the point and make it such a big deal, and if it really is MY career, then I would like to have a say in it, wouldn't you? I honestly only started enjoying the game a bit more after the script ended.\n\nAlso another pet peeve is the big deal they make of your created player: high school phenom, blue-chip prospect, once in a generation talent, etc, etc. And you come into the draft with a skill level of 55? This may not be a big deal (and actually fit with the last edition where your player went undrafted) but the disparity is so immersion-breaking. From having 'boosted' stats in High School/College where your 7 foot centre can literally hit 3-pointers from everywhere to missing 2 feet lay-ups in the NBA ... i should think that if I'm actually good enough to be drafted top-20 in the NBA draft i should be at least be able to make a jump-shot or two.\n\nAlso, because of whatever reason, your rookie season is abridged into eight games so that Spike Lee can turn your rookie career into a blurb. Which means you only play 8 games (i.e. compared to the regular season 82 you would have played in previous editions - meaning you literally miss out one entire year of skill points and never have a chance to break into the starting line-up). It also means the whole Rookie of the Year target which most players set their sights on is pretty much impossible/redundent.\n\nGame-wise its generally more of the same with better animations. A more robust blocking/swatting system is much welcome. But generally the AI appears to be more tepid and less intelligent this edition. The point-guard hogs the ball way too much and makes really bad decisions/shots. The transition game appears better and fast breaks are a lot more viable but the PC-controlled teams appear to have a huge edge in the transition game (most of the time your team are not even back in their half-court set when the other team pushes the ball back up the court for an empty lane).\n\ntldr: Spike Lee's story kills the immersion and the real game/fun only starts when it ends. They should have made the story-mode a toggle on/off feature when starting a new career. I feel that 2k15 plays a little better and is more immersive.","September 29, 2015","false","60.8"," 275 of 338 people (81%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","81","275","338","20","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swiftmike/recommended/370240/","swiftmike","SwiftMike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swiftmike/","272 products in account","This review is mainly slated towards MyCareer.\n\nIt's really upsetting, I played a lot of NBA 2K15 and after spending a majority of time finishing MyCareer and MyGM/MyLeague, I definitely got my money's worth after 300+ hrs. NBA 2K16, however, got pretty overhyped when regards to their MyCareer, which seemingly got worse.\n\nI think most people were under the impression that after all the positive feedback 2K14 and 2k15 got in regards to MyCareer, and how they enjoy a story around your character, 2k would finally go all out with one this year by hiring Spike Lee to direct it.\n\nSomehow, they went backwards. Even though 2k never had a white voice actor, hiring Spike Lee to be a ghetto visionary and make your family black and growing up in Harlem sort of ruins any illusion that most of the white players could relate to, which btw, alot of your audience is.\n\nAs for the customization people were hoping for, it some how becomes even more linear with Spike Lee making a strict storyline with choices you can not choose. Literally, the only choices you can make in MyCareer is Choosing a High School (1 of 3), choosing a college (1 of 9), and at the end of 8 games played (of 82) you get to become a free agent. Meaning if you wanted to play the 2015-2016 league, you only are playing 8 games against the legitimate rosters, and then enter free agency.\n\nHow did this happen? Outside of actual games, MyCareer lasted a total of maybe an hour. After completeing college and moving into the draft, Im finally in the NBA, next to top draft picks that have overalls of 78 and 77, meanwhile I have 55 overall and am somehow considered a top 10 pick. Where's summer league? Training camp? Where is anything that can allow me to actually progress without having to spend VC on attributes ?\n\nMost people do NOT want to start the NBA with 55 overall and don't want to have to spend money on VC to stay competitive.\n\nAs for what they did right, High School and College felt legitimately realistic. You're a high school phenom, and as such your character is seriously OP. You can steal and run the ball and shoot better than everyone, and as you progress towards the NBA, games get harder in college. Unfortunately there was no real culture to talk about with colleges, the only differences is the uniform and logo, and High School + College combined are over very quickly.\n\nEdit: More time put into MyCareer and gameplay is still solid, and now that the mediocre story is over, the grind for getting badges and practicing in the gym is actually enjoyable. Connections would be more interesting if they were more indepth and you weren't able to exploit them, but overall a nice addition. Still disappointing overall.\n\nAnother annoying thing to point out is the fact that during creating MyPlayer, while height and wingspan actually matter in this version of 2k ( which is a good thing ), the fact that choosing inside/outside/balanced position when creating your character limits your possibility as a player, and can't be changed. As a balanced 6'6 SF with maxed shooting, my 3 pt is below average that of another SF in the league.","September 26, 2015","false","107.2"," 264 of 325 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","264","325","15","30"

I generally play MyCareer as it is the most popular game mode, but I do occassionally play the others.\n\nPros:\n- The game looks great visually\n- Easy to adapt to new controls\n- Harder to do certain things that wasn't exactly basketball-like that older games had\n- Overall very smooth with decent cpu\n\nCons:\n- MyCareer is a racist joke: I ain't black so why is my twin sister black. Stereotypes everywhere. Spike Lee was the worst part about this game.\n- Not new user friendly: Be ready to throw your wallet to get any sort of decent start because your mycareer starts with a sub60 rating.\n- HOF Cpu is cheese itself: Wide-open jumpers fall 98% of the time. More shocked when it misses.\n- Some players just don't make sense: Bench players in real NBA and with low ratings in game plays like Kobe shooting over three guys.\n- AI defense is horrible: 80+ rating 3pt rating guard that can't finish on the outside? AI leaves him open. Pick and roll switch up? Non-existent. Basic man-to-man? How about Otto Porter Shaqtin a Fool every game. 30 RPG as a team and your player point guard has 8 of them? Why not.\n- Moving like you're on ice: Your player slides and glides like he's on ice and occassionally gets stuck when defending. Absolutely ridiculous.\n- AI passing: Have fun with turnovers because your AI teammates can't do jack.\n- MyCareer is a joke: Spike Lee is the worst part about this game. Oh wait... I said this already.\n- Certain players are just overpowered: Stephen Curry is a prime example.\n- Certain players just don't match with their stats and tendencies: Lebron is like the easiest thing to guard and Jeremy Lamb shoots over anybody and everybody. James Johnson shoots threes with a crap rating and low tendency which essentially means a turnover if he catches the ball near the three.\n- Refs are walking picks: I run into the ref on the fast break cuz they just on the court. I called for a pass and that thing ain't stopping until it gets to China.\n- Player does its own thing: Getting stuck in animations, not being able to do anything in certain situations (dive for ball and catching it, spin move and it starts pole dancing), and hyping up the crowd when opposing guard goes coast to coast for a dunk.\n- Get rid of the coach: He's annoying. How you gonna tell me score more inside when the only baskets we get are dunks.\n- WTF timeouts: They don't make sense *PERIOD* You get subbed in and a timeout comes immediately after they score. 10/10 trash programming.\n- Bounce passes: Slow, clunky, and receiver thinks its a booger and runs from it. No more fancy passes guys, stick with pick-n-roll and hope they don't do some superhuman sh** and intercept it outta nowhere.\n- Opposing HoF Defense is hax: Melo jumped over 8ft into the air to swat an alley-oop pass. Checked it in replay and Anthony Davis's head was under his feet. I broke up laughing at how sh** this game was when that happened. Wasn't even mad. Oh yeah and every player has whips as arms since they block passes out of their range.\n\nWhile a lot of these cons are persistent problems in the 2k games, it's just getting worse. Hyping up the MyCareer didn't help; it just added a sh** ton of backlashes.","November 24, 2015","false","537.1"," 146 of 177 people (82%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","82","146","177","50","0"

I’m one of those who basically bought the game for this mode alone, where you take control of a new player in the NBA and lead him to greatness.\n\nBy now, I’ve played three quarters of my rookie season, after leading my player through high school and first year of college. I’m blown away by how much of a blowout this game is. “Hold it right there for a second,” you might say, “the game isn’t out long enough for you to have played so far ahead!” If I didn’t know better, I would agree with you on that. The problem is, however, your “rookie season” is 8 (eight!) games long.\n\nYes, you’ve read right. I was shocked when I got to the “gym menu” and read that it was the first of eight games I would get to play in my rookie season. It’s frustrating. The game doesn’t give you any option to change this. This is not a basketball simulation anymore, it’s a farce.\n\nI want to lead my player through all 82 games of a season (plus even more in post-season, if possible), and in full-length at that. Maybe I don’t get much further than my rookie season until the next game comes out, but I’m with my player all the way until then. When the commentators praise my last game, I want to have been there for that. Why should I give a damn about what the AI made my player do?\n\nI don’t get any credits for that to spend on my abilities, I don’t get any chance to rise to starhood early on, and I don’t get any sort of information how I’m doing outside of the commentary for the next game I’m playing, or at least I haven’t found it in the cryptic menu structure.\n\n“Featuring a Spike Lee joint” is the worst thing they could’ve done. You’re forced to suffer through one of the most annoying stories I’ve ever played. And I’ve been through all of “Dying Light”. They praise it in the trailers with “Be The Story”. Guess what, that’s all you get to do, because you can’t make one on your own.\n\nI didn’t know what to expect, so my player is pretty much me. Every NBA 2K game I’ve played before gave me the opportunity to “be myself”, which mostly meant, a white guy with a similar name (so the commentators don’t just call me by my nickname) and “College” Germany (and a different height, depending on the position). In 2K16, that means a 7ft tall (Center) white guy has a black twin sister that seems at least a foot smaller, has no similarities in their looks whatsoever, and stays bland throughout the story, a problem all characters have in this. You don’t get to choose anything about yourself beside the appearance and some on-court details. Everything but the teams you play for is pretty much set in stone; and the teams you play for do not change the story a bit.\n\nYou follow a story of some random dude, instead of forming him yourself. There are some major crossroads he just barrels through without you being consulted. But hey, you can choose to go to UCLA instead of UConn. Congratulations.\n\nEven when you think you can choose something important (what a heated discussion in a cut scene about staying another year in College or agreeing to enter the Draft builds up to), he just says, “here’s what I’m going to do…”, cut to black screen, and whoop-de-do, welcome to the NBA Draft 2016!\n\nI feel no connection to Harlem. I feel no connection to the family. Suddenly I have a girlfriend, and I have no idea why she’s here (when I first saw her, I was like “Hey, who’s that? Oh, she looks nice, and she’s in an important meeting… she might be my girlfriend. Oh her name’s Yvette? Cool.”). My so-called best friend is always up to no good and I spend six-figure sums in lawyers and settlements to keep everything quiet about him and his escapades. My agent (who I obviously don’t get to choose, either) is a New Yorker, a self-proclaimed “Shark” with italian roots, where every “Mobster cliche” bell in my head starts ringing like a shot clock. I have no say in this at all.\n\nThe story tries very hard to create drama (to the point where it’s hard for me to suspend my disbelief), but it fails miserably at making me care, because it lacks decisions where my actions would have any sort of impactful consequences. If this was a movie, I wouldn’t see it in theatres, I wouldn’t rent it, and wouldn’t even waste my time on it would it be on Netflix.\n\nTechnically, the game is up to snuff concerning the simulation part, even though I despise getting fouled out in the third quarter because of the mechanics for setting picks (and for calling illegal screens). Otherwise, it’s ridiculously bad. The menu structure is horrible, you don’t find anything quickly. A training option where you get to train the moves one by one is completely missing, instead you get four instructional videos with instructions read by NBA stars who can muster about as much enthusiasm as if they were reading a recipe for sour cream cheesecake - or dubbing a 70s sex ed video.\n\nIn the few hours I’ve played, I’ve had about half a dozen Back-To-Desktop crashes, without the game freezing (it just closed the window). Other than that, the servers aren’t the most reliable, but that might be because the game isn’t even officially released yet. Oh god, I dread what it will be like in the week following the official release...\n\nGraphically, it looks very good, but that’s to be expected. There isn’t much more to improve graphically, anyway. Last year’s NBA 2K looked great, too. My PC isn’t the best out there, but it manages to give a decent image.\n\nUPDATE: As one of the comments so helpfully pointed out, the game "reverses back to normal" in the second season. The so-called "story" only ruins your rookie year, but oh boy is it bad, and cheesy, tacky, and all sorts of wrong. I write fanfiction for a hobby and I would've been able to write a better story on a tipsy saturday evening.\n\nAfter now going strong in my second season, the game does get better; but I still can't bring myself to recommend it, most of all not at full price. You lose the probably most important season of your career to a joke of a story.\n\nBugwise, it's playable, although for me there's one recurring thing: it has a kinda useful feature telling you things about your opponent when you come into the game (at tipoff or from the bench), but sometimes it fails to load that overview (only showing the player in idle animation), and the game takes about 20 sec to skip that screen and go back into the game.\n\nTL;DR: It’s not a bad game, per say, and perhaps you’ll find joy in it if you don’t care about the MyCareer mode, but in that mode, it dumps all its negative points right in my face early on although I usually like the NBA 2K franchise. I will continue playing it at least until after my rookie season, and maybe pick it up again once they bring me a patch that fixes this abomination called “Featuring A Spike Lee Joint”.

I used NBA2K10 previously, and found that after playing it I was more conscious of my court position and defense in real games. Shocked! Playing from third person perspective made me focus on things that I hadn't really nailed on the real courts. I actually spent a whole season playing 2K10 for a couple hours before every game.\n\nOverall, I think a guy like me is in a pretty excellent position to judge the gameplay here, so I think I owe it to everyone to review it.\n\nI made myself in the game - Average size center. 7'0, 260. Though real me takes few jumpers I opted for all-around.\n\nSo far, the good stuff;\n\nI love the post movement! It really echoes the way a lot of new players are being taught to post - not thinking about individual moves but thinking about position and response - You make a move and shoot if your defender wasn't able to respond, step through if he responded too hard, and make a second move if he responds smartly. It's very fluid, it's exactly how I think about my real post movement, and I like it.\n\nThe second season (Takes a long time to get there...) is much, much better than the ruined first season. You have choice about your actions. You are coached... (it's rudimentary but at least it makes you think about changing your game up). You get to train (awesome!), doing some drills that might look familiar to organized ballers, and there is plenty of variation so you don't just do the same drill every time.\n\n\nSo far, the bad stuff;\n\nThe main reason I'm not recommending this: It's freezing. Sometimes it locks my computer completely, sometimes it merely quits the program mid-game. The first few hours this wasn't an issue. Today it seemed to be happening every game or two. I really don't have time to screw around with this kind of issue, and I'm sure a lot of you don't either.\n\nSkipping training is a smart thing to do in season 2? Plain stupid. Since you literally buy your skill, practice is now just a waste of valuable marketing time. I actually liked the training drills - especially as a guy who is new to playing virtual-basketball and using a game pad.\n\nIn shootaround at training, you can't go back-to-basket and do a post move. What? I guess my guy is afraid of getting hit in the back of the head by a bricked shot. ♥♥♥♥♥. Let me post like in the home court screen. It matters to me, I'm a F/C. I don't want to shoot 3-pointers.\n\nSlow players jump unreasonably high. Head crashing into the backboard but I can't change direction. In real players, vertical leap is pretty closely related to the general speed of the player on his feet. Very noticeable in 55OVR F/Cs.\n\nStarter F/Cs react so slowly that there's no way they could ever play NBA. The slow CPU centers easily bust past 2 step sags.\n\nGuards tend to misuse my screens - use me to shear off the defender! They are afraid of brushing my shoulder.\nTo make up for this, 2k have put in some STUPID AI/animations where the screened opponent will go out of his way to trip over you. I've had a guy constantly changing direction just to trip over me while his man is 40 feet away making a layup. Insane stuff - it feels like cheating. I've counted guys running into me 4 or more times, long after their player has made his move. Sometimes they run into me even though their man is cutting away from me. They WANT to hit the screen.\n\nI have my stats elevated by crazy bursts of speed when I go for blocks and rebounds from way out.\n\nThere's no context to the actions - player never seems to bail out of a rebound when he should.\nForwards aren't ready for rebounds. They seem to set feet after you tell them to rebound, not when the shot goes.\n\nAt least one 3-sec violation per game because he refuses to move after ignored call for pass. UNFORGIVABLE.\n\nThe lack of depth perception (Not 2k's fault, but still a problem) means it's impossible to judge where a lot of shots will fall, limiting your ability to be ready for rebounds. CPU always gets the rebound on short airballs. Always.\n\n\nI'd say center is unplayable at 55ovr, but it gets a lot better once you up your stats a few points across everything. Pretty irritated about the amount of time it took for it to be playable though - I shouldn't need 10 hours of gameplay to be able to change direction and make a freethrow. Put me on an even footing. I don't want to dominate, I just want to be in the game. I am not able to believe I wouldn't get benched after 20 minutes shooting 20%, with a plus/minus of -15.\n\nAs for the rest - you heard it in every other review. The first season is completely ruined. You aren't actually in any control until the 2nd season, so I guess it's NBA2k17. What were they thinking? The game runs as badly as my player does. Tutorials are garbage. A white guy will have a black twin... Everything bad anyone else says is probably true.\n\nOh - and it's pretty hilarious to have my own shoe after half a season making 8ppg coming off the bench. 10/10 for comedy value. (And it's ♥♥♥-ugly. Didn't previous versions let you design them?)","September 29, 2015","false","100.2"," 92 of 120 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","92","120","14","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/passivewarfare/recommended/370240/","passivewarfare","WOLFGANG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/passivewarfare/","30 products in account","My honest thoughts about NBA2K16 and the NBA2K franchise:\n\nNBA2K16's gameplay is great. The overall presentation is very smooth and the graphics have really stepped up its game since 2K15. I don't think the controls are as great as it was in 2K15, but I don't really have any complaint about it. No more ripped jersey shorts when players are dunking. No more of those alien-esque eye contacts when camera pans in on the players' faces. Also a lot less shot-clock cheese.\n\nMyCareer this year has given me the most emotional turmoil, ever. I really disliked the story, as you probably have heard everywhere how Spike Lee tried to add in his 2 cents to 2K, which resulted in the your player's family being African American regardless of what color skin your player has. I do enjoy the many accolades your player is able to achieve and how quickly you are able to level your character up to at least an all-star level. One of the things I hated about the previous NBA2K MyCareers is how little of VC earnings you get after every game, but 2K has fixed that issue in this year's release.\n\nMyTeam is a mode I enjoy very much. Every week 2K releases packs that you are able to buy and every week it has a different series of challenges that you are able to compete. 2K has really increased the amount of variety of player cards that you are able to receive. For example, for every NBA player there are multiple player cards such as the player's default card, dynamic ratings card, moments card, playoffs card, TBT player card, all star card, MVP card, and many more. Each card by the same player has different ratings depends on the type of cards, and it really adds in some flavor in collecting your cards and makes it exciting to open up packs because it always catch you off guard on what cards you may get. My personal favorite: a bronze Sim Bhullar rated at 69, but is an absolute beast in the post both offensive and defensively in the game.\n\nMyPark in my opinion is... ehhh. The gameplay is really great and all, but a lot of the times the park is either empty or is just a bunch of people who have formed cliques, or squads, to play against each other. If you are just trying to play a game by yourself, good luck finding a match because "you can't sit wid us".\n\nNow, onto the franchise. Ronnie Singh aka Ronnie2K, the NBA2K public relations and the main spokesperson, is probably the biggest joke in the gaming industry. The guy has very limited NBA knowledge and is terrible at trying to attract gamers to come back for more NBA2K. I remember sometime in April when @NBA2K on twitter reached 1 million followers, Ronnie2K promised every gamer will receive a gift as a thanks to such an achievement. So what did some gamers get? A simple T-shirt for MyCareer, a knee-pad upgrade, or bronze players for MyTeam. What did I get? A 71 Rating Kendrick Perkins. Yeah, what a joke. This really agitated the NBA2K gaming community and as such, the community started a #Unfollow2K movement which trended on twitter for a couple of days. The very next day after it reached 1M followers, the follower count was at 989K followers.\n\nI honestly don't know if I would recommend this game, or any of the NBA2K releases going forward. Unfortunately 2K is dominating in the sports games with no other competitors in near sight (Yeah I said it, EA), so I might consider buying some future releases... keyword 'MIGHT'.\n\nThanks for reading this review. I hope you find this review helpful on making your decisions in purchasing this release or any of the new NBA2K releases.","May 9","false","208.4"," 80 of 102 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","80","102","3","1"

Less pros and more cons I am afraid.\n\n--The game is 60% SOLID GOLD when it is not fudging things.  It rewards you for hustle and punishing you for playing stupid D.  That is how it should be every game.  Unfortuately there is the other 40% and makes you want to throw your remote through the monitor.  There is nothing worse than playing a game and feeling like you have no outcome on the results.  Hmm...come to think of it...sounds just like Spike Lee's garbage.  OOPS!  Sorry...that was a rip in the PROS section.  Sorry!\n\n--The second season is how the game should be.  You have a lot of options to make money/points.\n\nCONS:\n\n--I don't think I have to elaborate much on the utter BS that is Spike Lee.  He makes the first part of the game so painful that I am DREADING having to do it again.  I know you can skip things but you should not have to live through one second of it.  As other says....it's brutal.  What's funny is that if a white person had done this 'first year' he would have been called a racist.  Since it's Spike its ok evidently.  Add to it that you have ZERO control on ANYTHING that happens.....just f-ing brutal.   A cut scene where the parents talk about how they met?  Are you MENTAL?  OMG!!!! Who the SH-T gives a flying f-ck how his parents met?  Seriously?  If I wanted to read that I would steal my wife's romance novels.  STOP THE MADNESS!\n\n---The game is 'fixed' to an extent, worse so on the higher difficulties.  If you shoot 65% from the field the Ai will simply 'adjust' the game so that the other team will get multiple offensive rebounds (even if they are the worst rebounding team in the league), have 10+ points more from the free throw line (in one quarter) and of course the old faithful game 'balancer" the 3 point shot.  Listen, this happens every F-ing game!!!!!  Its not a 'every once in a while' thing...the computer WILL make you miss/turn the ball over/<insert thing you did not do>.\n\n--As you play you will be "throttled".  In this I mean that in 'real life' the chances of you going 10 for 10 from the field is pretty slim.  Well, this is just a game of code so you WILL be forced to miss shots.  I am ok with missing shots...its just missing the WIDE OPEN LAYUP or DUNK....TWICE IN A ROW....that I can not tolerate.  If you are not throttled there it will happen at the beginning of the game (especially in game 2 or 3 of a playoff series).  You will 'magically' start only making 1 or 2 out of 7 shots.  That happens right? The problem is your shots are of the wide open layup/dunk variety.  I just roll my eyes becuase I KNOW that I will 'struggle with my shot'...and then magically make the next 12!  This exact situation has happened MANY times to the point that I can predict it after 3 shots in the game.\n\n--I duped a guy in the post.  I went up for a layup (not sure why a 7'3" guy would do a layup when he can DUNK while standing on the floor) and just...missed it.  Can't this happen?  SURE it has happened.  The problem is that it happens EVERY F-ING GAME!  This is 10 fold the story when you play the highest difficulty.  I passed to a streaking Jimmy Butler who was a few feet ahead of his guy...aka a BREAKAWAY.  He could have dunked it with his mouth if he wanted...but he does a layup and almost missed the whole rim.  Why?  We were past the magical number the computer said we could be ahead because it must REMAIN CLOSE!\n\n-- By this time last year I had almost 250 hours in game.  This year...pft!  I pick it up once a week, play a quarter, get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and then rage off.  Double teaming is worthless for applying pressure.  Its only helps with contested shots.  Pressure, the guy just passes out of it with ZERO problems.  Then I stand in front of the guy I am guarding with my hands up.  He just throws a ball that flies right over my head to the guy under the basket.  The Ai can pass like that all day and there is NOTHING you can do about it.  Steals only happen if you jump the lane...but if you are standing IN THE F-ING LANE the ball goes just in front of your face..and the second guy...and the third...to the one under the basket who will F-ING NEVER miss the shot.\n\n--They adjusted the passing so that if you are in an excellent spot to intercept a pass...and you are not allowed to steal it because the other team is on a run or if you have too many....the pass will move at 3x its normal speed so you are late.  Happens EVERY GAME.  This goes 10x for trying to intercept the ball on the inbounds.  It just simply goes faster so you can't intercept.\n\n--They adjusted the game so that if the ball touches ANY PART OF THE OTHER TEAM'S players it you will lose the ball.  Now, this seems to make sense right?  Yes and no.  Yes it makes since but no it does not because IT DOES NOT COUNT AGAINST THE Ai OPPONENT!  You dribble on a guy's foot..turnover (remember, you won't get 90% of loose balls).  The Ai will dribble the ball where it goes THROUGH your HEAD and CHEST as your arm goes through it as you try to steal it.  The ball will then go through the two defenders next to you and they will score.  This actually happens MULTIPLE times EVERY game.  Even had one game Kyrie dribbled through my legs and lost the ball...or so I thought.  It went 10 feet away, changed direction in mid air and then shot back into his hand so he could power dunk on me.\n\n--Went on a run.  Did a pick and roll in which both guys tried to trap me.  Great right?  I bounce passed to the open guy 3 feet in front of the basket.  He catches it and...layup?  No! Dunk? NO!  He gets ready to jump but then just pauses until the defender 10 feet away makes it over.  Then he tries a REVERSE LAYUP...that goes INTO the defender.  This shot got...BLOCKED!  I know!  Shocking!\n\nI don't know why I bother playing this game.  I guess its for the 60% solid gold part.  Its the 40% FOOL'S GOLD part that make me quit.  I am quite sad as I know next year will be using 90% of the same code as this year.  It will end up the same and I just can't do this again.  They have lost me as a fan.  :-(","September 28, 2015","false","130.3"," 74 of 98 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","74","98","8","0"

This game will not be counted." --> Caused when you press pause in 1st quarter and sometimes caused by CE users. Still rewards a loss even though it says that game will not be counted\n- Ball tangibility still not good (ball going through players, floating in players hands, ball teleporting dribble)\n- Poor AI for both your teammates in mycareer and cpu opponents (cpu still more effective because of HoF cheese)\n- VC harder to earn than in 2k15\n- Over agressive CPU defense (not that I like last year Nba Jam, but this is way too much)\n- PnR way too effective\n- Brick wall knocks down players on every 2 screens\n- Awkward automatic fadeaway on contested shots that arent that much contested\n- Barely any graphical improvement over the last year\n- Performance issues (havent encountered them personally, but many people with high end GPUs have them)\n- Invisible players in every game mode, even Park/ProAm\n- Same terrible upgrade system from 2k15 that they tried to "balance" adding stat caps. Grouping attributes in categories prevents players from specializing in certain areas and therefore all the players are the same. (cant make a player that is good at freethrows but sucks at 3 pointers etc..)\n- Inability to configure keyboard controls\n- Controller settings often reset (boxout assist strength and defensive assist strength)\n- Took them 10 days to give us our preorder bonuses\n- Players missing from MyTeam collections\n\n\nTo sum up: Definitely not worth the full price. Get it in a month or two after few patches and on some discount.","October 27, 2015","false","270.3"," 60 of 78 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","60","78","5","8"

Rebounding works good, thats the only praise I will give this game. Story sucks, character creation sucks, customization sucks, pay too win sucks, gameplay sucks and can be incredibly frustrating to the point of wanting to punch a hole through your monitor or smash your game pad into a thousand little pieces.  Honestly, this game just sucks.\n\nBelow is what is broken.\n\n-CPU STEALS (Good luck dribbling in a straight line, the cheese cpu steals are real with this one, guess how many times cpu gets called for reaching in? NEVER)\n\n- ISO MOVES ( Also ties into the cpu cheese steals, I call it the turnover stick now. Even with the absolute setting and a decent playmaking skill half the time you will do a random move and often multiple random moves which results in, you guessed it, turnovers)\n\n- SHOT METER ( So you know for a fact you got a perfect release? Well 2k doesnt think so. So many times I've stoped the slider on the left of the bar only for it to magically appear on the right)\n\n- USER STEALS ( So youre hand goes straight through the ball and you think you've got yourself a steal? Think again, the cpu steal cheese does not carry over to your abilities, you're more likely to get called for a reach in. Many times the cpu will run right through you and it wont even phase him, you try to do the same? TURNOVER)\n\n- CPU DEFENSE ( So you just pulled off a sick spin move without turning the ball over and you're now 6ft away from your opponent with an open lane to the rim? Well too bad! The cpu wizardry will warp the player at light speed and stop you in your tracks mid dribble)\n\n- USER DEFENSE ( Good luck playing any sort of relevant defense as a guard if you dont have near max athleticism, you could play defense just as good as the computer but the cpu will most of the time either glitch right through you or run right around you with ease, and good luck getting back on defense if you take one wrong step because youll be stuck there for about 3 seconds)\n\n-CPU SHOT SELECTION ( So you just tossed Joakim Noah the ball right on the baseline with an easy driving lane to the hoop and you're wondering what kind of mystical dunk he is getting ready to perform? FORGET ABOUT IT, he's going to stay planted and shoot a fadeaway 12 footer and miss badly, costing you an assist and some points on the board.\n\n- TURBO BUTTON ( So you're mashing the turbo button because you see something in the defense you can exploit? Well too bad for you because it will take at least 2 seconds, if at all, before your character decides to start sprinting into a cpu player who wasn't there 2 seconds ago which results in more turnovers.\n\n\n\nI know I'm forgetting many more flaws.\n\nPLEASE, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT SUPPORT THE DEVELOPER WHEN THEY CONTINUE TO RELEASE BAD GAME MECHANICS YEAR AFTER YEAR AND DO NOT RELEASE ANY SORT OF RELEVANT PATCHES. STICK WITH 2K15 OR 2K14 FOR THAT MATTER, AS EVEN THOSE GAMES ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THIS TRASH. DO NOT BE A SUCKER AND WASTE 60$ ON THIS GAME, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. DONT EXPECT TO PLAY ONLINE UNLESS ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS PLAY BECAUSE THIS GAME IS DEAD, MY PARK IS EMPTY.

Maybe let's do it bit by bit:\n\nGeneral:\n\n- good ol' VC is returning and damn it's good to have it back. I so missed flushing 50 bucks down the toilet for a game and then being charged for any and every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t item. The prices have gone up and are now really insane while how much you earn, even on HoF has actually gone down.\n\n- lack of technical support makes a return as well. Yeah like always the PC community is again the but of the joke because again we are desperately waiting for technical issues to be solved and are waiting and waiting and waiting. 4 weeks after the pre-release the PS4 patch is out for 2 weeks now and we still haven't seen ♥♥♥♥ or even been given a possible release date.\n\n- lack of support also makes a comeback. Yeah for a game that costs you 50 bucks or more you will actually have to wait  up to seven days to even get a random answer which does not relate to your problem at all and which, even when you press them, offers no help whatsoever because they either don't know or they aren't allowed to do anything.\n\n- commentary of the game cuts out like every quarter. It's unbearable.\n\n- there is a bug that displays players naked or makes the invisible. They are invisible yet they pass, dribble, shoot and score on your ♥♥♥ all day long.\n\n- 2k TV regulary crashes the game.\n\n- the audience is barely audible. During freethrows and timeouts it's basically like you are playing a pickup team on a farm in Iowa... no sound at all.\n\n- you have around 10-20 seconds before the actual timeout screen sets in allowing you to change settings and setups and you can not ever skip those 10-20 seconds. So have fun with that one especially when the stupid A.I. calls 2 timesouts back to back.\n\n- basically anything above Allstar Sim is getting close to unplayable because of all the incredible cheese the A.I. pulls off\n\n- defensive A.I. of opponent improved while the defensive A.I. of your team is absolute garbage in every situation\n\n- still too many animations in which your player gets sucked into\n\nMyCareer:\n\n- hyped to no end because it's a Spike Lee Joint and because people were complaining about the player basically being chosen for you (background story and all) they produced a hillarious video in which they claim that you can "be yourself" and make your own story. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on that one. You play a guy called Frequency Vibrations, I ♥♥♥♥ you not, nickname Freq. This is the name you will be referred to in game even though you have the option to name your player and the announcers will, at random times, call you by it. That no one thought to tell Spike Lee to ♥♥♥♥ off and that not even the actors themselves thought it is beyond stupid that anyone would call anybody Frequency Vibrations is just... well I can't find words for it. You are also forced to be African American because your family is black as is your twin sister and obviously everyone around you apart from some overhyped agent who speaks and acts like it's 1930's Chicago south side and an Asian girlfriend who seems only interested in your money. Yeah... you heard me.\n\n- you do not make any decisions in your career until you reach your second year in the NBA. Every cutscene is an overlong piece of film that you are forced to watch (some lasting 10 minutes easy) or skip. You choose no answers, you make no decisions and that stuff is so corny like someone actually tried to make a bad comedy out of "He got game"\n\n- you get to play 3 games in Highschool which last all of 2 minutes per quarter in which you play against dwarfes ( I believe the tallest player might be Tracy McGrady's height and that guy plays center) while you stroll around in your up to 7'3 glory. What a joy. You can do everything, run fast as the wind, shoot threes and what not even though you are only rated 55. Once you get to college the real NBA stuff applies and unless you are buying VC (because guess what you don't earn any in Highschool and College) you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 55 rated player even though you are hailed as the next Madonna or some such.\n\n- your first NBA season is 8 games... with a 55 rated player unless you buy VC... yeah what fun. At the end you get to actually go into free agency even though you are a first round rookie so should have at least a 2 year contract plus 1-2 years team option. Oh yeah and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ end to the story happens.\n\nMyGM:\n\n- legacy issues like having to manually adjust every gameplan instead of the newest global gameplan being taken into account without having to delete the old specific gameplan for a team. broken player promises: even if you kiss the guys ♥♥♥ and do everything he asks you to, he will still return a day later and tell you that you screwed him over and lied to himn and doesn't like you anymore. Guys who put up 0,5 ppg in 1 minute of gametime will come to you asking for a starting spot etc.\n\n- no list for team names in relocation so you might end up with a team that has no name the announcers can pronounce\n\n- players still develope too fast\n\nOnline:\n\n- full of cheaters and yes I'm saying that even though I moderate a thread for the CE tables to this game. Funny enough the same ♥♥♥♥ as last year is still working and even more horrendous VC farming is possible. Now 2k swung the banhammer and guess what? Even though lots of people claim that they removed the cheaters, they actually only removed the guys who used VC glitches because of course it costs them actual money ;)\n\nPositive:\n\n- defensive A.I. seems improved\n\n- post game seems improved\n\nEnd of story:\n\nAs it is it's a pile of garbage. You want to know why? Check above... it's because the devs and producers were busier explaining ♥♥♥♥ that makes up 0,1% of the whole game in dope ♥♥♥ videos than actually improving last years installments.

There are more animations and they feel smoother and more realistic. Dribbling and using the right stick to crossover and perform other moves is still very satisfying. The shot meter is back and feels the same helping you to guide shots into the net. Defense even has its own meter that shows how close to the defender you are and how much pressure you are producing on him.  There have been some small control changes since 2k15. Now the face buttons of the controller allow you to perform bounce passes, or lob passes alongside the standard pass. This helps you feel more in control and turn the ball over less. Centers and other big men down low feel more like you are playing their counter parts. Slow, not very good ball handling but big tall bruisers who use their size to their advantage. Defense has been slightly improved and shots are harder to make, as you are less likely to be wide open. This more realistically portrays FG % in the NBA and feels less cheesy online.\n\nGraphics are improved as well, with 2k adding in new body scans. Carmelo Anthony now looks substantially different than Lebron James. As mentioned before animations feel smoother and more realistic. I have experienced some crashing issues when in game and navigating menues. There are also some random glitches in game that detract from the overall experience. For example there is a new feature when your my player is subbed into the game.This feature shows the player you are currently guarding or being guarded by. It shows the players strengths and weaknesses. There is a problem that occurs randomly however when the players strengths/ weaknesses never appear and you are stuck looking at a semi frozen image of the player for 30 seconds. After playing last years version im sure the bugs will still be there months later(none are gamebreaking save for the infrequent crashes, just minor annoyances.)\n\nThere is no ability to configure keyboard controls. 2k literally gave no thought to the PC gamer with this port. Crossfire is terrible but with my one AMD r9 270x i am getting 60 FPS with very little stuttering, so i am pleased with the optimization especially over last years version.\n\nThere is a wide plethora of game modes in this years game, i have never dabbled in My team because i hate pay to win. But MYGM is fun and feels improved. The real reason i cannot recommend this game at full price is the changes to MYCareer and to be specific the changes directed by Spike Lee. Livin' Da Dream is a joke.You create a character like in past iterations of the gamemode however this time you dont get to choose a nickname because that persona has already been created for you. Spike Lee has dubbed your character Frequency Vibrations or Freq for short, sex toy or porn star either way the name is terrible. The story revolves around your character and his family, you are born into a african-american family with an african-american twin sister. If the story following all this was actually good and well written than maybe i could excuse my white character who looked totally out of place and confused as to why his mom had never told him who his real father was. Honestly its not a big deal, things like this have happened to other races and games in the past and i could get over it, the problem is the story is absolutely terrible. The story revolves around your friend VIctor Van Lier who is supossed to be a bad influence on you and you are warned multiple times by the team owner, your twin sister, and your characters girlfriend who comes out of nowhere sometime in college.\n\nYou dont get to make any choices about how your story unfolds besides the choice of High schools (1 of 3) and choice of colleges (1 of 9). The story is so melodramatic, people arguing over your image or multiple refrences to friends and family using you as a meal ticket. Choices of team do not affect the story any. Minor details like your characters celebratory dance "freaking and vibin" as well as interviews of family and friends during the cutscenes do nothing to add anything to the terribly written farse that is Livin' Da Dream.  Spike Lee seems to believe that people from Harlem have the same terrible vernacular that he embodys in his titles. This terrible story mode takes away your rookie season as well, which is something that 2k really seems to enjoy in MYCareer the last two years. You get to play 3 Highschool games where your character is truly OP and 4 college games but not earn any VC for them as well as not be able to change the game lengths. Your character than is forced to be a one and done player and go to the NBA draft with an overall rating of 55, which is terrible. You are heralded as a top 10 draft pick, i went number 7 but the other players selected around that time are 77-78. By design 2k makes you either a terrible player or have to open your wallet just to keep up. Your rookie season is only 8 games (instead of the 82 in a real NBA season) with Spike Lee's terrible 20 minute cutscenes in between. Also you can change the Freq nickname after your rookie season but for some reason announcers/ pre game show will still sometimes refer to you as Freq.\n\nAfter your rookie season MyCareer returns to its roots allowing you to play any games along the season you would like while also introducing a new days off feature and allowing you to select whether or not to go to a "Live practice" or hang out with teamates/fellow Nba players or go do endorsement deals. This is where MyCareer should have started. "Live Practices are fun and really the draw in this mode is building a character and watching his career progress rather than slated cutscenes of melodrama.\n\nSomewhere along the way this mode lost all its basing in realisim as well because after your first season the team owner realeases you to go into Free Agency where you can choose three teams that have varying levels of interest in your sevices and negotiate Money and minutes. I think Spike Lee tries to rationalize it with your friend Victor causing you to get fired. Honestly though has anyone ever heard of a top 10 pick being dropped because of a friends actions? Spike Lee just took the easy way out as he did with most of the other parts of this mode.\n\n\nTldr: Really i cant recommend the game even though gameplay is so much better and graphics improved because of how much the Mycarrer mode has declined. I still find ways to enjoy the game, but get it on deal since this is turning into a yearly cash cow akin to EA's.","September 28, 2015","false","59.1"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","34","41","6","0"

I think NBA 2k is consistently the only worthwhile basketball title every year.  I love it mostly. But I was unable to even connect to this offerings server. It also follows a sad precedent that appears to be taking hold in the video game industry, especially in the regurgitated yearly sports titles. I named myself B F Skinner and wanted to get online in 2k almost as a ironic statement of protest, but wasn't able to. Back in the days, a guy named BF Skinner put hamsters in a box and studied their reward response through a small lever and a treat that was dropped upon pressing it. He figured out that when they press it and instantly receive said reward, they will eat the treat and lie down. But when the reward was randomly dropped they would continuously press the button to exhaustion.\n\nThis is the basic underlying element of MyTeam. If you don't believe it, watch any of the pack openings on internet video sites. What you are witnessing is the highs and lows which stimulates the brains chemical response mechanisms. When the user taps the button(buying packs) he will repeatedly get cards he doesn't like leading to depression/frustration. When a gold/whatever other stupid color special card drops, they jump all over the place with glee, brains flooding with endorphines. This is troubling if one understands the mechanisms which are involved, considering real money is being spent. Seems to closely resemble the same involvement of drug abusers and their crack of choice. If doubles where eliminated, or if VC was more readily attainable, I guess it would seem more acceptable. It also seems to be marketed directly to minorities, which is another thing that may or may not be okay to you. I have also seen that when one shows a willingness to spend money, your myteam players seem to perform worse then they should. I can recall in 2k15, getting Steph Curry(Mr three ball cheese) and lighting it up with glee. All of a sudden he's hitting 2-30. Same with KD. etc etc. "Gotta get more packs,,,, Next one is Mike,,, 50 dollars,,, just one more,, awww kostas kodsafjiosdfjioasdg? Emerald Dirty Ballscamp??? Double, double, double,  C'mon!" <-- sound familiar? You've been gamed, boys and gals. Next time you needs a sammich, think of all the gold cards you can't sell.\n\nThis may or may not be okay to write, as I'm sure this is not the info that peeps want you to hear. Could possibly get the business for sharing it. But they don't teach B F Skinner usually. I'm sure some may know, but it feels wrong when others are fleeced for their dollar and coin. Buy a game with some integrity, which actually has value, made by people interested in putting out a quality product. People who value your business, and respect your intelligence. Less taking selfies with millionaire b-ballers, less cute spokesmodels, less "oh snap, a penny!" <lunges to the floor to grab>. More community support, more involvement in production, more beta testing, more originality. An added bonus would be to consider the fact that the people you are taking money from are human, and may or may not be able to afford your digital heroin. Just my two cents.\n\nHonestly, I loved this game for years. Just feels so wrong on so many levels. My recommendation, skip it until they decide to make changes. This is the only way change happens. You keep forking over your dollars, it will keep getting worse.\n\n","October 1, 2015","false","226.9"," 41 of 58 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","41","58","4","2"

Passing is pretty easy, but sometimes the players are getting into a movement right before you pass, those passes fly anywhere but not to a teammate( it seems to me this happens because the game has overall big problems with input lag). Input lag is annoying af, i tested it now on several configurations and two different rigs, as well 4 different controllers. Its always there and always affecting things on court.\nIf you're an attacking pg, this game hates you then, while you drive to the basket and have a path like moses, everybody on the opponent team will catch you( not matter how fast you are)i witnessed it a lot that a sf or sg just kinda teleported to me and blocked me, while i was getting stucked in some weird layup animation i did not choose(i have the steph curry layup pack, which rarely applies). Big no go is also defense. Enemy Teams always defend like pros (which is actually nice and challanging)BUT your Team defend like a new born child, this is especially in mycareer annoying. Im sure that withour those animation stucks and rigged scores this game would make actually a lot of fun, ofc the input lag should be fixed(this seems like its pc only, as i watched many youtubers and streamers and they never really had it)\n\none thing to the mycareer, while i like the idea its poorly made! hey they got spike lee and some actors WoW! the story is boring\nand never really interesting, also never really a surpise whats happening( besides the talk that im a superstar when i only play 12 min per game(12min qtr). its way to short as well.\n\nso this game seems to be only for addicted nba dudes like me, new guys wont like it. the controlls are way do difficult. and no help for new guys when they start a career or do something else, they have to search for help(yeah i know tutorials are boring but for new players in this type of a game, needed badly)\n\nmy final conclusion is:\nif you love the nba and the nba2k series you most probably already have it, if not you may pass on, on this one.\nits way better then nba live(which tbh is not very hard)but since they got "next gen" it did get more and more a type of game that looks and plays awesome for the first 2 weeks, but if u know more of it and understand everything it starts to fall apart.\ni have also a lot more i could go on about but those things are in the series forever so i do not believe they fix it ever.\n\n\nps i forgot about mypark:\nmypark is kinda fun but on pc their're a lot of cheated players (99ovr) which are mostly pretty bad but a lot of 2v2 groups are out there cheating their ways to the top. Also a lot of ballhogs and wannabe kobes,lebrons,kds,mjs.\n\n","November 12, 2015","false","80.2"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","34","46","3","2"

Whatever mode you want to play, 2K15 is better.\n\nThe gameplay is worse this year, and sticky defense comes back with a vengence. You can't even take 5 steps without the defense bodying you up.\n\nWorse than that, turbo is broken. Players who are slower are catching faster players regardless of attributes, and everyone can defend like Scottie Pippen 1v1, regardless of attributes. Not a fun experience.\n\nMyCareer sucks badly. I got tricked into buying the game because of the so called story, but there isn't one. It's the same  damn thing as 2K15. Essentially your entire rookie season is condensed into a cutscene where you watch stuff happens, stuff that you won't ever do. Also, no more custom nicknames, you're stuck with Freq. Forever.\n\nOnline takes the cake, though. Cheaters are rampant, and the people who ends up banned are the ones like me, people who accidentally discover bugs in the game and report them. I got banned for simming games, trying to upgrade my MC.\n\nPC support sucks. XBone and PS4 already got patch 2, and not even a mention of PC.\n\nDon't buy it. Don't even accept it as a gift.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpankyPie/recommended/370240/","SpankyPie","Spanky Pie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpankyPie/","4703 products in account","Every year, basketball games like to brag about how much smoother and more fluid the game is. I think this is the first time it was very clear that a lot of things did improve. This is quite honestly the best basketball video game I have ever played.\n\nI haven't run into many performance issues, and the game runs much smoother for me at even higher settings than 2K15. Your mileage may vary, though. This game was designed with a controller, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a keyboard. The pro stick (RS) is essential to playing this game, and keyboards just won't offer you the same level of control.\n\nMost of the game modes in this year's game are pretty much similar to last year, but with more meat. In MyGM and MyLeague You can now relocate your team if you wish, and your owner can now give more dynamic goals (in GM). Also, AI logic is heavily improved and makes building a perfect team much more challenging, if not impossible. MyLeague also now has an online mode where you can play a League with your friends, similar to The Association Online from a few years back. MyTeam, along with the game modes present in the previous year, also has a new game mode called the Gauntlet, which is a 3 vs. 3 game against other MyTeams.\n\nThe game now also has more online features than ever. MyPark makes a return from last year, which is pretty much the same, but now you also have a customizable MyCourt where you can invite your friends to play on. There is also the 2K Pro-Am mode which is similar to the Jordan Rec Center in the previous game, but not hidden behind the MyPark system. It also has a proper matchmaking system, which makes it much easier to get 10 people from around the world to get together to play a full 5-on-5 game. There is also Play Now Online which is basically a ranked online game mode where you can advance through different "leagues" which represent your skill level. Pretty similar to most other games' ranked matchmaking modes.\n\nMyCareer is in a weird place, where the game actually have already built a whole backstory for your created player. It has some weird quirks as I created a white player living in an African-American town, with African-American parents and an African-American twin sister. That takes the immersion out of the game mode a little. However, it is interesting in the way that you get to experience a custom curated story, unlike previous years where you're mostly just playing to increase your stats. You also now play through high school and college, which makes for an interesting experience, instead of just being thrown straight into the league.\n\nThe presentation is also much improved. The menu interface is much slicker and more accessible than 2K15. The actual game also now has pre-show, halftime and post-game shows featuring Shaq, Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith. The voice of the third commentator (replacing Steve Kerr) is awesome. There are also lots of player interviews which helps the atmosphere that you're watching a live TV broadcast. There are 50(!) in-game songs that make up the soundtrack which almost guarantees that you won't get tired of the playlist. Genres range from the standard rap/hip-hop to rock to pop and even some Spanish and one Korean song.\n\nAnd those are all great, but the best feature this game has is really how much better the actual basketball game is. Drives feel much smoother and traffic congestion within the paint is now no longer a problem if you run proper plays.  Defense is also much smoother and as a defender, I haven't found myself being left behind by the ball handler unless I make an actual mental error. The controls have changed, and there are now 3 pass buttons (seriously?), but the post trigger (LT) is a great idea and if you get used to the new controls, it actually feels more natural than the previous games. And of course, learn how to use the pro stick for best results.\n\nI'm sure if I play more hours of the game, I'll start to notice some annoying quirks. However, 5 hours and counting with the game and I can say that this is the most fun I have with a basketball video game. Even when you're losing, you're still having fun because the game doesn't feel like it's forcing invisible walls for you to get through.\n\nIf you're interested in basketball, and you haven't played a basketball video game in a while, NBA 2K16 is the one to play.","September 25, 2015","true","129.6"," 61 of 98 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","61","98","4","3"

Your best friend is an unlikeable jerk, your manager a stereotype, the owner is the devil, your twin sister and parents may or may not match your skin color(honestly those characters are cool), and the girlfriend is kinda just there.\n\nThe Mycareer mode now has game days and offdays, which is a nice change added to break up games.

Controls are all changed from what everyone is used to. The pick and rolls are now even harder to perform as the center or power forward takes a while to get into position or sets a screen for only a miniscule of a second. Shooting is disgusting because even the tiniest bit shy off of a perfect release or over would result in a miss, even in a situation where it's the most wide open shot. Passing is the same as usual, you try to pass to one guy but will pass to someone all the way across the court. Zig zag cheese is not gone as the CPU now zig zags you into their picks. In conclusion, the new mechanics of the game is what is actually ruining the gameplay and improvement was mainly focused on the different modes rather than gameplay itself.","October 9, 2015","false","74.3"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","22","30","2","1"

The story is the polar opposite of what MyCareer is suppose to be; its not your ♥♥♥♥ing story. They should change their slogan from "Be The Story" to "Be Spike Lee's Slave". The gameplay isn't bad, but it is definitely rage inducing at times. The defenders stick to you like glue, then you can't guard for ♥♥♥♥. Your teammates are ♥♥♥♥ing useless, they just stand there and when they get the ball they can't make a damn shot. It seems like no matter if you play the Sixers or Cavs the other team is just made up of juggernauts. If you play MyCareer, you're teammates are ballhogs who can't shoot or defend, and in MyTeam you entire team is just ♥♥♥. The gameplay throughout all gamemodes is obvioulsy scripted, but the worst part about all of this is just how much 2K doesn't care. They took the money and ran, but what's new? An American company butt♥♥♥♥s the consumers again, what a surprise. Getting caught up in the hype, I preordered the damn game thinking it will be different this time, I was wrong. I normally wouldn't preorder a game, after this game I am staying true to that. If 2K would just patch the game(it would be quite a large patch) everything would be good because that means that they are finally listening to the consumer, something that is rarely done nowadays.

There is 0 information on if or when it is going to be fixed. 2K won't even admit publicly that there is a problem in the first place. The support team is unable (or unwilling) to help and the community management absolutely fails to communicate with the player base. And that's only the icing on the cake. Since the beginning, there are a lot of cases of players losing their MyCareer character because of a corrupted safe file and not getting any compensation even if they bought their VC with real money or heavy lag online which basically persists since NBA2K13.\n\nSo sadly I can absolutely not recommend NBA 2K16 even though it is an incredibly fun game simply because 2K gives a ♥♥♥♥ about its playerbase.","February 10","false","581.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keeks22/recommended/370240/","keeks22","keeks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keeks22/","85 products in account","NBA 2k16 has incredible graphics, gameplay is generally very smooth, and server performance is vastly improved from recent years.  However, there are an insane amount of small issues that add up and these have all been here since release, that makes gameplay very frustrating.\n\nMany features are incomplete, or just dont work.  Directional passing for example, there is no way to pass to a player behind another player without manually selecting that player and allowing the defense time to react.  every second counts in basketball.\n\nVIP Stats (their online stats program) shows in depth tendencies and stats about the opponent you play at the loading screen, but there is no way to see any stats besides PPG and Win/Loss for your own profile, when they obviously have the information available to them.\n\nWhenever a stoppage of play occurs there is a period of time where you are stuck just watching a cutscene, no matter how badly you want to skip, you cannot.  This happens at literally every single stoppage of play, and for me is the most infuriating part of the game when I am trying to play a fast paced game.\n\nPlay Now Online allows players to choose their own jersey before they match up with another player, so if a player chooses a white home jersey before they match up with me, gets the Away team, and then doesnt change their jersey I will have no idea that he is using a white jersey instead of what should be a colored jersey since he is the Away team.  This means both teams in game have nearly identical jerseys and the game is so frustrating to play when you have to really stare to see who is on which team in transition.\n\nMyGM and MyLeague have a multitude of options, but lack very basic NBA rules such as the veterans minimum, and protected picks, the latter completely destroying any hopes of a MyGM or MyLeague with the Lakers without cheating and force trading their top 3 pick.   You can sign Steve Nash for 725k or so but in real life he cannot be paid less than $1.49m if he were to sign a contract\n\nAt times gameplay AI seems random, for example there seems to be a 50% chance that on a transisition you pass the ball to your teammate he will either stand still and catch it or keep running and theres no way to know what will happen.\n\nOn offense the AI actually sometimes feels like it is rigged against you, with your players playing either unrealisticly or flat out refusing to obey controller commands.   Example:  shooters that have a wide open 3 go inside the line and when I try to get them to go behind the line (and this has happened many times for me), they literally just wont go behind the line I dont get it.\n\nDefensive AI feels the same way.  Double team is set to manual but they still decide to leave their 3pt shooter wide open to double team someone who doesnt need to be double teamed, and wasnt told to double team\n\n2K puts no effort in updating hairstyles of players, with the majority of players having the same hair they had in summer 2015 when they got scanned, and there have been lots of changes during the season.  Allen Crabbe is one example thats not even close to real life anymore\n\nMyCareer is terrible the first season is garbage the High School and College experience comes off as annoying and tedious since none of it matters at all there is no story that changes its the same thing every time, so after youve made your first player its just annoying to go thru it all over again to get to NBA.\n\nCannot stress how bad MyCareer is we were told that we were going to Be The Story, and that couldnt be farther from the truth.  Its Freq's Career by Spike Lee for the entire first season, you only get to play 8 rookie games!!\n\nEvery single game of Online play you will have to change your settings, they just do not save and there is no way to get them to default to something else.  This functionality does not work and has not worked for years.  It even changes the camera angle so if you dont get the first possession you have to play in Broadcast mode until you get the ball.\n\nIn MyGM, MyLeague, and MyCareer, your gameplay settings (length, difficulty, sliders) all have to be set every single time you make a new franchise/career no matter what the default settings are.  The default settings seem to only make a difference in Play Now offline.\n\nGetting locked in animations.  Just ridiculous there are so many long animations in this game ESPECIALLY after scoring a bucket and celebrating your opponent can run the ball up court while you watch your player dancing and celebrating in the backcourt.   Just terrible.  Awful.   My controller actions are not suggestions they are commands\n\nIf your controller gets disconnected during online play, you cannot reconnect it under any circumstances and have to restart 2k in order to be able to play it further.  This will always result in a loss unless its late in the game and you have a comfortable lead and waste the clock playing with your keyboard.  But idk even 1 control for that\n\nMyCareer doesnt allow Draft classes.  cant think of any reason to not include this.  It also doesnt allow GM sliders so the trades and Free agency are unrealistic in MyCareer mode\n\n\nOverall this is a very good basketball game, but the tiny problems make it infuritating to play\n\n\n\nAs we unfortunately have to ask every single year in the 2k community,\n\nPLEASE FIX YOUR GAME","May 22","false","125.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

However, just because I have it not recommended I suggest you read the entire review to see if you would like it.\n\nI am not going to get into day one issues like crashes, bugs, and server issues because frankly basing a review off that this early before they can fix things is stupid. But there are issues I PERSONALLY have with the game. But I'll say a few things this game offers over 2K15 first.\n\nProsImproved animations definitely.\nFinally readded create-a-team for MyGM, MyLeague, MyTeam, and other online modes. (And its actually really good)\nTattoos are freaking amazing and you can place them all over your body.These were a few off the top of my head I was pleased with.\n\nThe Issue\nHowever, as I mentioned before I had a huge gripe with this game. In my personal opinion they seem to have taken a step back when it comes to MyCareer. Others apperently like it but I was extremely disappointed by the fact the "story" was stereotypical, thoughtless and not enjoyable. I expected more from Spike Lee & 2K. So with giving us an actual story (if you want to call it that) they severely limited how we can play. This isn't OUR story. It is Freq's story. Yes the protagonist has a name and even if you had a simple name like Joe Johnson they will still say Freq regardless. You do not have a choice to be called something else like in previous MyCareers (my personal choice was "Silky" Johnson) If you want to play a white, asian, hispanic or really any race that isn't black you have to suspend your disbelief that your family is black and you are not. To make matters worse you have a fraternal twin sister so you really cant think your mom cheated on your dad either. You can't win Rookie of the Year because you can only play a few games in your rookie season. The "story" is insanely short, badly written, predictable, pointless and a waste of time. They took away more of our choices and options so they could waste our time with that?\n\nYou may be saying, but wait! Didn't they let you play through high school and college? That sounds fun. At first yes it was interesting to just destroy the high school competition and finally see some college basketball, but its exactly the same as a normal game just reskinned. You only play a few games of high school and a few of college then you get drafted. And after a handful of years MyCareer has been out, THEY STILL HAVENT ADDED A REACTIVE DRAFT. Meaning if you get drafted first, guess what? The Timberwolves get two number one picks. You and Karl Anthony-Towns. So the draft is basically pointless because it's always the same even though you are in it no matter what your position is. Sucks for you if you play PF and you get drafted first because you're gonna share minutes with a guy who shouldn't even be on the team. Teams won't draft based on needs either apparently, in fact its hard to say for sure what they'll draft on. But if you're a center for example expect Detroit, Utah, Sactown, and Orlando to want to draft you even if they have a franchise center because why not. Same for playing any other position, they will draft you regardless. They should have just placed the MyGM/MyFranchise draft AI into MyCareer so we could get SOME chance of being surprised even if they arent that great as well.\n\nOnce the story ends, its basically MyCareer as last year.\n\nI feel so ashamed of 2K and Spike to have made this game mode such a huge selling point of the game. If you are considering getting the game because of MyCareer, do not get the game.\n\n\nIf you don't care about MyCareer\nThe other gamemodes are solid, if you can can see past the cheesers, hackers, etc in online modes you'll have a lot of fun in ProAm, MyTeam and other game modes. Personally I play mostly MyLeague/MyGM and I enjoy it throughly even though I was hyped to play MyCareer. The relocation aspect of MyLeague/GM was sorely needed in previous entries and they finally added it and its actually good and not bare bones. You can upload images to use as the team's logo, court logo, advertisements, arena name. You can edit the court exactly how you want it, all black if you want to. You can also do this in online modes, create your own team and court which is what it needed. The animations are fluid and smooth. They changed the passing mechanics a bit and a few of the controls so it's an adjustment. Still slightly disappointed that 2K still hasnt revamped the draft prospect aspect of League/GM because its still extremely generic. They could at least pull a Madden and give the prospects a storyline and allow us to actually grow attached or get hyped for a prospect. I was also going to say they could give the random generated prospects faces but they still use the team jersey portraits (say if you trade Damian Lillard it changes from showing his real life counterpart to some nasty ultra low settings doppelganger) so there goes that.\n\nOverall however, aside from MyCareer its what you can expect from a yearly sports game release.","September 25, 2015","false","217.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

It is a huge regression from last year for a number of reasons due to the way the story was put in place.  The biggest issues:\n\n1)  In your rookie NBA season, you only play 8 games.  After those 8 games, you move on to your sophomore season where you can then play a full 82 game season.  At this point, the game has sent players all over the place in free agency, so the teams are totally different than what they will be this season.  So for instance, I cannot play more than 8 games without Tim Duncan retiring.\n\n2)  The story is really stupid and feels forced upon you.  "The team isn't sure about signing you because you are friends with Vic."  Are you kidding?  And no matter how well you play, you get this way over-dramatic storyline that detracts from simply being a rookie trying to make it in the NBA.\n\n3)  There just simply isn't enough content in this game that responds to how you play in your games.  There were plenty of cut scenes in 2k15 that would cater to your performance.  For instance, the coach would call you in and congratulate you for your rebounding effort or how you distribute the ball to your teammates.  In this game I haven't seen any of that (though maybe I just haven't played long enough to see it).  All of the cut scenes in 2k16 play out just like a movie (a downright terrible one).  I play games for an immersive, interactive experience where my play affects the outcome.

There is also a HUGE RACIST issue with MyCAREER mode. I play a 6'8" WHITE dude, but still - his twin sibling is a black girl, which would be possible if their parents were an interracial couple, but they're both black too! If the issue was the opposite, you'd want to play a black kid and both parents and his twin sibling was black, there would be a HUGE scandal for days now. Don't know who to thank for, I think Spike Lee could say something about that - I remember him complaining that Clint Eastwood had failed to include a single African-American soldier in his films Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, both about the 1945 battle for the Japanese island. Eastwood justified his choice of actors, saying that those black troops who did take part in the battle as part of a munitions company didn't raise the flag. So I suppose that Spike Lee defied reality and made white players to have a black background. It's just stupid and ignorant. There's only one world in his mind - New York City (Harlem especially) and only one race - BLACK. Keeping up with the story makes you facepalm twice an hour. Nevertheless, the game itself is almost pretty good, the tracklist choice is AWESOME. For now, I give it a strong 7/10. If you have NBA 2K15 you can easily stick with it. Still, if there will be NBA 2K17 next year, I certainly won't buy it before the official release and then some solid opinions form other sources.","September 30, 2015","false","131.3"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","42","72","6","32"

However the amount of bugs along with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MyCareer really forces me to not recommend this game.  The online works fine for the most part, no real connection issues, ProAm and all of those things are a nice addition.   I had a HUGE issue when I first started playing the game, I went into the graphic options and messed around.  I DISABLED V-sync and dynamic V-sync along with all of this, after applying the changes, the game froze and crashed.  So I then restarted the game and it began to run at 1FPS, luckily I remembered that 2k15 had a similar problem albiet less intense.  So I went into appdata/roaming and opened up the config file, only to see that the v-sync options were still enabled. I disabled those and launched the game again, now running at 200fps.\n\nList of bugs I've encountered:\n-FPS issue above\n-When subbing back in during MyCareer the player info pane never appears, forcing me to quit to the menu and reload\n-Player is litterally stuck in an animation when a pass or rebound is taken away at the wrong time.  You have to wait till the possesion is over\n-Some freethrows count for 2 points, then resulting in the team shooting to get the ball back.\n-The menu when you choose to either hang out/train or advance get's stuck on screen DURING the game\n\nIf 2k patched out those problems the game wouldn't necessarily be better, just less annoying to play.  MyCareer is ♥♥♥♥, no real choices like they advertised, and you still have to pay for ♥♥♥♥ing accessories like socks with VC.  I only bought this game because it was on sale at GMG.  If it was full price, no way in hell would I have bought it.  There are just not enough changes to justify the full price for this game.","September 29, 2015","false","17.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The problem with this is that they have no pressure to get their ♥♥♥♥ together.\n\nI gave this game a positive review after playing maybe 10 hours because some basic issues with NBA 2k15 were fixed.  The movement feels more fluid than in that game.  NBA 2k15 is without a doubt the worst NBA 2k game ever made.  This is probably the 2nd worst game in the franchise though.  A new review is being written after playing many more hours.  I only play so many hours because I assume problems with the game are my own lack of skill for a bit, until you really get to notice specific problems.  I also just love basketball and keep getting fooled every year.  And it's such a shame because NBA 2k14 on next-gen console, not PC, had such great potential to be improved dramatically in the following years.  They removed all their progress for God knows what reason.\n\nThe big draw is that Spike Lee did the MyCareer mode, and frankly it's by far the worst career mode in any sports game I've ever played, or any game with any mode even remotely comparable.  They put you in a Spike Lee film basically, except Spike Lee was obviously not allowed to make something like he'd actually put in a film (most of his films are R rated and this game is E rated, so you can imagine all the things he'd have to censor himself about).\n\nSo they make your character's background be this incredibly stereotypical borderline offensive plotline, something which would be called racist if Spike didn't do it because it'd be called a parody of black life in New York.  You use 90s rap slang in a modern setting and have all kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t happen which doesn't actually move the plot of you being a basketball player forward.  I'm shocked Big Daddy Kane didn't have a writing credit.  You play like 8 games, 4 high school 4 college, to determine your draft slot.  Not a terrible idea by itself.  But they paint your character the whole time as being this godsend of a player.  Think of the way Lebron was anticipated as a kid out of high school.  Yet, if you spend no VC on your character before the draft, he comes in as a 55 overall.  This makes your player the worst in the league, literally.\n\nThis is problematic for 2 major reasons: (other than the absurdity of being painted as Lebron and then coming in to be the worst in the league by far).\n\n1) College and high school games are a complete waste of time.  Draft position couldn't matter less in any context, just your own role playing.  I normally care about draft position in these games, but they also usually care more about how I play during MyCareer in return.\n2) You cannot skip this for new players.\n\nAfter you're drafted, they only let you play 8 games of your first season.  It's abysmal.  Also, Spike's story actually has nothing to do with your real NBA career, i.e. the reason you're playing.  All it does is give you 2 hours of cutscenes interspersed between the pointless high school and college games.  There's hardly any actual story once you're a bonafide NBA player, which defeats the entire purpose of the mode.  The only thing you get are "meetings" with some select few famous players, and that's not actually anything more than clicking on menus and seeing some kind of a stat or VC boost at best.\n\nThe MyGM mode is plagued with the practice time issue.  It becomes a nuissance immediately.  The mode itself is pretty easy, it's nowhere near as complex as something like Out of the Park Baseball is, obviously, but it's probably as bad as its ever been.  The trade logic, despite promises to the contrary, is equal to how bad it always is.  There's always so many dumb trades you can pull off.  It boggles my mind that the game allows such game breaking trades to be made.\n\nAnd the gameplay itself: again, the game feels better than it did last year, but not better than 2k14, and not better than almost any other year before that.  The shot meter is the one thing I like, and even that is bad half the time because you'll regularly miss perfectly aligned shot meter shots.  It defeats the purpose of the meter if you miss midrange jumpers with an 88 overall player on a perfectly in the green shot.\n\nThe game feels like one of those old hockey tabletop games where all the players are stuck to the floor and you can only rotate them to shoot in a puck.  The players feel stuck to the floor.  They are moved against gravitational logic into positions to contest shots in ways which, after watching replays, make you want to tear your hair out.  The AI still cheeses with the shots it takes and makes.\n\nThe teammate AI in the MyCareer mode is, honestly, worse than it was even last year.  It makes it so that on high difficulty you can average over 40 a game and a triple double and still lose by 20.  How am I supposed to win when I get double'd, pass it out to open guys who can't hit shots that I'd make in real life?  2k NEEDS to get their act straight because the game suffers immensely.\n\nOn PC the multiplayer modes have low populations.  The one mode which doesn't, where you take your MyCareer player to the park, has strange limitations.  If you don't choose to rep the park with the beach and the aquarium, you'll basically be left all by yourself in the ironworks park with no one to play with.  That mode has tons of hackers and cheaters in it, based on the complaints on the forums as well as what I've seen myself.  I haven't done much of that mode because the people who play that mode play almost exclusively that and you'll get killed repeatedly.  I'm really good at full team vs team basketball but the population is too low to rise in rank on that mode, all the people who play that regularly are already all at the top ranks.  You aren't allowed to play with higher ranked people for some reason in spite of population issues, it's a terrible design choice.\n\nAnd the VC gouging.  Everything costs more.  More money.  Pat Riley talked about the disease of more, where people wanted more playing time and more money for themselves to break up a potentially winning basketball team.  Who knew that you could also apply it to a video game franchise about basketball?  This game feels like the biggest cash grab yet, and that's saying a lot given the antics of last year's game.  They kept the terrible ♥♥♥♥ing system of upgrading stats in blocks, and now you have even stricter limits on your player's ability to rise in rank.  I'm stuck at 88 overall, I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do to be allowed to go higher in rank.\n\nAnd come on, 1000 VC for a ♥♥♥♥ing headband?  It's disgusting.  Absolutely disgusting.  I'm a fool for buying the game every year but I just love basketball so damn much.  If the Out of the Park guys made an NBA or even fictional basketball manager sim, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.  All the games that exist of that nature are awful, I've looked, so don't point me to that terrible basketball manager game that's on Steam.  And if those guys are reading this, you too should get your act together because there's money to be made and a complete void in this market.  If somebody came along and gave us a good basketball game, we'd all play it.\n\nP.S. It's a game where the players in real life actually are able to do better things than in this game.  It's a basketball game where you can't ever actually dunk on someone because of the flawed defense system.  There's still problems with height advantage in this game, a basic ♥♥♥♥ing concept in basketball.  This game is about a 55 overall, same as the rating they start your MyPlayer at.  But if they spend money, they can pay me and I'll upgrade their rating.  Or maybe just work on the gameplay this year?  And yes the 2kTV girl is hot but is 2kTV really a necessary feature?  It's just a waste of resources that should be going into the actual product.","December 31, 2015","false","111.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","3"

While there are actually quite a few possitive changes to the gameplay mechanics they are completely overshadowed by the the fact that this port is even more buggy and even less optimized than the previous iteration even though it is clearly made in the same engine. Just to top it off the Spike lee directed storyline is uninspired and frankly just lazy. I when you make a Myplayer of an ethnicity other than black or a mix of black you still have 2 black parents which would still be acceptable except for the fact that they were so short sighted as to give you a black twin sister which is 100% impossible. Considering that the Online play just god aweful on PC the only reason I bought the game personally was for the single player experience so in my opinion you should just save your money and buy 2k15 when is goes on sale if you really are craving a basketball game.","September 28, 2015","false","176.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

There are many positives to the game if you play it with the correct mindset. However, with that being said, there are a few issues that are rather annoying when they pop up.\n\nMyCareer- Spike Lee screwed up the mode quite a bit, but once you get past the storyline, it is better than ever. BUT the storyline, is absolutely hilarious due to the fact that I am a white Point Guard who acts not like the average black man, but the average ghetto, uneducated thug. Good for a laugh for sure but definitely a bit unrealistic, considering that you have a black twin sister. It is just a story mode until the end of your rookie season, and then the choice is all yours as to how you do things.\n\nMyTeam- Great gamemode if you put enough time into it. Any game you play will have one or two players who bought their way to skill. There will always be that one guy who just dumped a bunch of money in the game and therefore is automatically at an advantage. The other big problem with player vs player is the fact that there are many ways for you, not neccesarily to have an advantage, but play in a not so polite manner. Spamming three pointers is very easy especially in modes like gauntlet so beware because most people do it. The same goes with Zig-Zagging and other tactics that lead me to question the amount of fun that they might be having. Also the computer is infuriating at every turn. The game is designed to make it challenging, so you will end up missing wide open three pointers and dunks but the computer, somehow dunks on everyone and shoots threes fading over centers. Sucks, but deal with it because there is nothing that you can do to combat it. No matter how good of ball handles your player has, you are prone to suddenly dropping the ball at random points.\n\nGame Quality- So despite the problems I just mentioned, the game itself isn't that bad. If you have an older computer or a lower quality computer, than you may have to lower the game settings in the menu. Does it suck, yes, but you get used to it. Most of the people who have lag and framerate issues are trying to run the game on max settings on a computer that has the gaming ability and power of a microwave. Don't blame the game for your bad computer.\n\nOverview- Worth the buy for sure, but like every game has its issues. You will enjoy the game if you have regular expectations. I love the game and we need more people on the online servers so the game is worth the money.","January 28","true","731.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Anyway, my negative review is about not having customisable pc controls (I haven't even found how to efficiently defend yet, because I don't know the keyboard controls) and it's also about the lack of options in My Career. You know, Spike told me that I'm going to feel like this is real and that I'll have many options in My Career, but I haven't seen anything like that yet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamMeTheFuckOut/recommended/370240/","SteamMeTheFuckOut","Call Me Super","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamMeTheFuckOut/","118 products in account","At it's current state, I don't recommend this game, not even if you get it from a gray key site. No, not becuase "This game is racist because my family is always black and BLAH BLAH BLAH" (those people need help if the really feel like that's racism). I don't recommend it because of what really matter: the gameplay.\n\nNow the game has made some improvements over last year, like some animations are better, it's not as easy to make shots as it was in the last game, slightly better player customization, the rival of MyCrew via the new ProAm mode (even if we can't play on our courts yet), MyCourt, some bugs/glitches fixed, etc. However there's a lot of new issues in the game, incuding some from the old game. For example, Demigods and hackers are back on MyPark. People have had 99 overalls since the day came out for people who preordered and managed to get things outside of their rank (skateboards, shirtless option, mascot gear, etc). Speaking of MyPark, the servers are very hit or miss. Either it runs smoothly or everyone lags the entire time and the game runs like a slideshow. Also there's an issue with the Got Next spots that sometimes happens that prevents anyone from getting on them. Also, that 1v1v1 mode they have in MyPark is kinda lame, but that's just me nitpicking.\n\nMoving onto MyCareer, it's also kind of a mess. The story is lame. I understand them wanting you to feel like a high school/college phenom, nad those games were fun, but once you get drafted is where I have issues with it. You're being being drafted amongst player that have ratings in the upper 70s (probably some in the lower 80s as well) but your overall is at a 55 to start, and yet the characters in the story talk about you potentially going lottery pick in the draft. The rookie season is only 8 games, which isn't that bad, except you basically get no VC at that point so you don't rank up that much going into your 2nd season. Also they advertised the new MyCareer story to make you think it's all about choices, but you really don't until you finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story. The only choice you get is the college you go to, and even then you only get about 10(?) choices for schools. Once your rookie season is over is when you actually get to make choices, which I enjoy. I like that you get to choose how you spend your off days, even though I wish you'd get more VC out of endorsements (since it doesn't seem like you make that much in games, regardless of how wellyou do).\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game, however, is the stability. Whenever I do MyCareer or Play Now games, my frames drop a lot, the game stutters, and the game crashes a lot. The game sometimes switches from full screen to windowed mode for no reason no matter what my settings are. All in all, I'd say just wait for a patch before you buy the game.","October 2, 2015","false","97.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The graphics are gorgeous. But the gameplay has become intolerable. You spend most of the time trying to get the player to move where you want them to move. I don't know what it is, but when a path is open and you push that direction, there is no reason for that player not to move there (no matter how bad their stats are) So instead you will continuously press harder in that direction (don't do this, eventually your controller will break).\nMy biggest gripe is the "My Career" mode. It's not moving in the right direction drama-wise. Before I bought the game, I read all of the criticisms regarding the Spike Lee story and didn't think it could be that bad. It was BAD. It was basically a bunch of LONG cutscenes that are incredibly boring, there is nothing interesting about the story. I remember Spike Lee movies having a little oomph to them but this story was vanilla and played out like a Tyler Perry story. Painful.\n\nBesides that, it is the same ol' become a NBA player and get mandatory endorsements (I would rather endorse a cheap shoes like Starburys) and become a corporate shill, just how the NBA is supposed to be.\n\nBut those things aren't the worst part about My Player, it is the slow pace that you get VC. They intentionally gimped the amount you get to entice you to buy some online. Like a free-to-play game.  And you almost have to buy it because your player starts off awful stat-wise. My character was a  pg whose stats are so bad it is painfully obvious that they don't belong in the NBA let alone have teams competing for their services. No rookie of the year possibilities (I'm not even sure if it's possible)\n\nWhen your stats are bad, your passes go to the defenders. While playing defense your character automatically RUNS AWAY from offensive players. Opposing defenders don't allow you to effing MOVE and when you try to move (spamming turbo)... turnover. (same crap as the other version) so nothing different there.\n\nBoring post game press conferences supplant the obnoxious cut scenes in season 2, it's just not worth it (in MY Career at least)  Fun!\n\nI am a huge NBA fan, and would like to play a basketball RPG for once that I could relate to, but year after year, the same basic premise and actor. The direction they take My Career is so far removed from who I am IRL, I lose immersion. Instead of changing the formula up, they double down on the formula. Who asked for this?\n\nSo, be warned. Then again, this is just my opinion.","February 14","false","108.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

After finishing incredibly boring and distasteful first season (Spike Lee shenanigans), it turns into a pretty good game. Rebounding is seriously improved over the past few editions, and park is better balanced (still not perfect, of course, but at least it's not full of 7'3 people). Stat caps are serious business this time around, and they really help that balance. However, it does mean that you hit the wall pretty early in terms of progression and then it gets really slow afterwards. Graphics are really nice and the game works fine for me in 4k on a single 980ti (60 FPS, no hiccups). Bit of a downside is that MyCareer still doesn't offer proper challenge and balance at higher difficulties. For example on Superstar, my team will simply lose more games than on All-Star, but I am still able to average around triple double (31-11-9) on my All-Around SF in 2nd season. Seems that increasing the difficulty just makes your team miss more, and other team hit absurd shots. But then again, this is really no different than before.","February 15","true","244.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You would think that after all the money 2K makes from their microtransactions, that they would atleast fixed most of the mistakes in their previous games. But Noooo, they decide that it's a waste of time and resources to fix problems on a single game in an annual released series. I swear, 2K is becoming EA in some ways. But 2K maybe worse, mainly because of the fact that unlike EA, 2K doesn't bother fixing any big glitches/bugs. They are only in it for the money.

Upon clicking his name in the very limited menu there is one stat that stands out, now this will save you the trouble of "monitoring him for the future games" You can see clear as day he's 7'6" 230 lbs, mistake or no mistake this looks bad on you and I don't feel like playin the game. thanks Will.\n\n\n\nHello Jason,\n\nI completely understand how frustrating it can be when you’re an honest player and have to deal with cheaters in a game. As a gamer myself, I know this experience can be extremely annoying and discouraging. We appreciate customers like you who have the best interest of a fair game in mind. However, here at 2K technical support, we do not have the necessary administrative tools to ban players. But not all are bad news, the developers are aware of unfair player’s and they have procedures to ban those who cheat.\n\nYou can report unfair players to Steam through their support page. Naturally, if, at any moment, you would like to report someone who's not playing fair, you can always come to us.\n\nI hope this clarifies your question, but should you have any other doubts or concerns, let us know and I’ll be happy to assist you.\n\nGood luck on the courts!\n\nKind regards,\n\nFlora R.\n2K Support\n\nTo sum things up, if you wanna play with cheaters and have 2k do nothing about it then buy this game, Cheers.  (I also included screenshots of the cheater who was sporting a cool 7'6" 230 pound center)","January 16","false","540.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Maybe..\n\n"Contains spoilers"\n\nMyCareer\n\nFirst of all, lets talk about Spike Lee's "Livin da dream" story to MyCareer. The story is stereo typical on the highest level possible. I made a  white player, but my whole family is black. Slang words in every sentece is frustrating to hear and watch(subtitles). Conversations are so unreal, stupid and too long.. And you cant even choose your own nickname. So prepare to be called one thing and only ONE THING.\n\nThe story starts in High School which is pretty cool. 2K tries to add an nice atmosphere, and it's actually decent. After the High School games which are apoximately 4 games(2min quarters), you are getting offers from several Colleges around the country. Then you choose the college you want to attend to and 8 college games later, you are littereally in the NBA. I dont know why 2K want you to rush through theese stages. They should allow you to choose between how many games you want to play, aswell as how many minutes the quarter should last. Because in the end, it doesn't feel real at all. After you get drafted to the NBA, your first season will likewise only be 8 games and then you become a free agent. Luckily after you have chosen your new team, during free agency the main story ends and you can move on with the game and your career.\n\nYour second season in MyCareer is where it all falls back into place. It feels like home again and I was actually starting to enjoy the game because I could play throughout a whole season, making endorsements, connections and so on for my player.\n\nPro-Am\n\nNew to this year's 2K is Pro-Am. I have been looking forward to it, and it was one of the first things I tried out when i started up the game. This game mode is better than "MyPark", and especially if you have a couple of friends to play with. It's a 5v5 game, where you control your MyPlayer amongside others, either you team up or you simply just join and wait for 9 others.\n\nThis game mode has a unique feature, where you can build your own team from the buttom and have friends to join in and play for it. You are able to design and UPLOAD!! your own logo, shirt, arenas and even the scorer's table advertisements! I have already made my hometown's team "Aalborg Vikings", designed their jerseys so they look 100% as they do in real life. Costomized their homecourt aswell, and added real advertisements. Let me just say, that I cant wait for my friends to join in!","September 29, 2015","false","201.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","1"

This is the first year that I have actually been frustrated by NBA2K.\n\nI would advise caution when purchasing this game if you are anything close to an impatient person, because this game can and at times WILL test your resolve.  I per-ordered the game and I am really disappointed in myself for not waiting for a sale.\n\nHowever, all that being said...\n\nWhen it works, the game is great.","November 5, 2015","false","165.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

First of all, if you don't have a new nvidia card then dont even bother because it is not optimised for anything else.  I have a gtx 970 so i can play it pretty much maxed though.\n\nI am going to talk about the my career mode mainly since thats all I have really played and it is pretty much what I buy 2k for.  The problem with this game is the story kind of ruins it.  Your family is black even if you make a white character and the story is really cheese and you don't actually get any choice in any big decisions for your character.  The cut scenes are 20 min long even though they could be summed up in a 1 min scene.  The story definitely affects your character too much.  You don't get to decide what type  of person you want your player to be- spike lee decides that for you.  He also decides that you will leave college after your first year even though they make such a big deal over what a huge decision it is.  One of the biggest issues is that you dont get to play your rookie year.  You only play 8 games and you have no chance to make the playoffs.  Also, your ratings in this game start out at the lowest ever.  only about a 50 overall.  And best of all, you make no vc at all for the high school or college games.  And since you only play 8 games in your first season, you pretty much go into your second season with that same rating.  I think that this is just greed on 2k's part trying to get you to buy vc because if you didnt preorder the game for the extra 10k vc and you are just playing from the starting rating it is really brutal to try and progresss.  It is basically like taking a middle school kid and throwing him in to play with professionals.  It is really annoying to see this happen in a game that I paid 60 bucks for.  And, after all this hype over the story, it ends after the first season.  The story really ♥♥♥♥ed up this game and I really think 2k should just give you an option to skip it entirely and just play your first season as normal.\n\nSo that is a lot of bad stuff so you would think that this would obviously be a negative review however there actaully is a lot of good stuff as well.  Mainly in terms of the actual gameplay which I feel is what matters most.  2k has fixed a lot of the cheese from previous years and I really do feel like the game plays a lot smoother now and all of the animations look a lot better.  The high school and college games are actually done extremley well even though you dont get to play many games.  There is a lot of little details that they took the time to add that really add to the realism of the high school and college games.  You also have a lot more options to customize your player.  The practice mode and the other options of how to spend your off days is a really nice touch except for the fact that the practice mode is stuck in a side view camera that you cannot change (2k PLEASE FIX THIS) which makes some of the drills pretty much unplayable.  I also really like that you have the ability to see contracts from 3 different teams and try to haggle with them to get more vc and minutes.  Another thing I will add is that, in my opinion, the music in this game is a lot better than in previous 2k games.\n\nAll in all, there is a lot of bad in this game but I do think 2k pulled through where it really matters which is in the actual gameplay.  And I think that the gameplay is actually so much better than every other 2k game that it makes up for the storyline cheese which is why I gave it a positive review.","October 3, 2015","true","75.1"," 25 of 45 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","25","45","0","2"

First of all this release is extremely unstable and as usual 2k is slow to fix the bugs. I've been dealing with framerate issues from launch. They've patched it and now the issues seems to be isolated to playing career mode where the game fluxuates from running fine to speeding up to slowing down. I've tried playing the game with all of the graphical settings on low and I'm seeing the same results.\n\nAside from the technical issues, I wasn't very happy with the opeing of career mode either. Going from high school to college then the NBA was cool but being forced to watch Spike Lee's preach story was not. I was forced to watch a 20 minute cutscene that I couldn't skip or pause? Ridiculous. I feel that the story had a good moral but came off as forced and preachy. Not to mention the game features another stereotypical portrayal of an Italian American with questionable character that Spike Lee is now becoming known for. I as an African American male can't support all of his views.\n\nOn the gameplay front, 2K is still top notch. Controls are again improved. Excellent game on that count. However I'm hoping that another developer starts making A+ basketball games as 2K hasn't been forced to step it up since they have no competition.

It doesn't matter if you're Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, or Joel Anthony, you'll miss pretty much every shot. Even if you're wide open for 3 with a 99 overall 3 point shooter, you'll miss it most of the time. The AI literally shoots through you, and don't bother trying to defend the shot, you'll get a foul. According too 2k, players like Leandro Barbosa can make 360 layups THROUGH players like Moses Malone. It doesn't matter what your layup rating is, you'll miss them all. The. Time.\n\nMy Career is complete garbage, you're forced to play as a stereotypical black guy from "Da hood". Even if you're white and make a white character, you have a "twin" black sister and black parents. You're forced to interact with a typical loud mouth black guy and you can't say "Hey! I hate this guy! I want nothing to do with him!" There's no choices in this god awful "story" so thanks piece of s**t Spike Lee, the only world and dream in his mind is all black. You're not "Livin Da Dream" you're living Spike Lee's stereotypical race obsessed world. Stay the hell away from 2k. And don't give me the whole "Most video game characters are white" because in this game, you're supposed to create your own character and play as him. I don't see any games where you create your character and you're forced to play as a certain race. Thank god you can skip most of the cutscenes and it only lasts one season. Speaking of the one season, it's your rookie season which is wasted since you only play 8 games. You also can't skip these games, or the high school/college games, so if you've played MyCareer before, you have to do the same thing again.\n\nThe game is filled with hackers and 2k is doing NOTHING once again, people should stop supporting this terrible company. Say what you want about Live, but EA is actually improving the game. Sadly it's "cool" to hate EA so the biased "reviewers" give it a 5/10 or ignore it, and the blind sheep bash it.\n\nMyTeam is completely dead, I started Road To The Playoffs after completing Domination, and of course I can't get out of the 9th seed because the mode is dead. It's bad enough that I can't do a "Head to Head" and use my very good team, instead I'm stuck with dog s**t bronze players (they're the worst in the game) even though I have 6 amethyst players the rest being gold. I only managed to play one game, and it lagged like crazy! The shots were delayed, the FPS dropped to 30 during free throws (which were also delayed) and timeouts. It felt impossible for me to play defense, it felt very loose. The servers still suck, SURPRISE!\n\nAs I said above the servers STILL suck and 2k isn't improving them.\n\nThe animations are clunky, slow, stiff, and unresponsive. When you go up for layups you will either (A) Miss and your character slowly walks AWAY from the basket instead of grabbing the rebound, or (B) Miss and you jump multiple times because this god awful game can't register movement properly. It's impossible to play defense because the AI EASILY blows past you and you can't turn around in time to catch them.\n\nDON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE GAME EVEN IF IT'S $10!!!! STOP SUPPORTING THIS GREEDY COMPANY OR THEY WON'T IMPROVE THE NEXT GAMES!!!!\n\nEDIT: Another big problem with this game is turnovers, if you try to dribble near a defender they'll steal it most of the time.","March 26","false","242.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You'll jump for rebounds and half the time it clips through you and goes to the guy you boxed out or the AI will just throw you behind and them even though you're in front of them.\n\nAlso, if you like them to poke out the ball in the most ridiculous ways that make no sense along with more clipping to go along with it to help cause that problem.\n\nYou'll also miss good shots all the time. Like too much of the time. I've missed 16 shots in a row that were all great shots that were in my strong zone.\n\nI just can't give a good review to a game that has so many issues as much as I play it. it's bugginess is just bad....\n\nAlso the Turnovers from the AI ARE TERRIBLE!  They literally are telepathic mind readers just an FYI\nYou're character also has a lack of hands. half the time the balls just bounces through his hand without grabbing the ball at all. Bad mechanics\n\nAlso the refs are blind half the time. Especially when it's a player with a decent rating they will get away with a lot of fouls. In a game? right? idk explain to me why I hear a loud smack on my player and the ref acts like nothing happened\n\nAny player considered good also will make you miss 90% of your shots.

For PC via steam, expect the game to crash.. a lot! My commentary regularly drops out, The scouting and assignment screen sometime just lingers without any actual report coming up, the halftime locker room is sooooo slow to progress, and you can't skip to the evaluation - it skips the whole lot. Trying to skip through timeouts, or substitutions is a nightmare, it takes FOREVER -  and a lot of the time you just have to suck it up and wait through the whole process before getting back to playing.\n\nI do however like the physics of the game, and even enjoy the new controls.. I generally play a big man and use a lot of post moves - so the post up trigger is really working for me. The controls do seem sluggish compared to 2k15, but it may just be the limits they have now put on responsiveness and speed for bigger players. Dunks seem to be easier to perform, my player even with a 55 rating was posterizing everyone.\n\nI also have fallen victim to purchasing the MJ special edition - and played my entire rookie season without any boosts or help with VC... still no indication on when my VC will come through - it's the 29th, I waited till release day.. still waiting.\n\nThe game seems to rely, HEAVILY, and I mean HEAVILY on you PURCHASING VC.. the my NBA 2k16 phone app hasn't come out, opportunities to earn VC in other ways are limited... It just really sucks. especially after shelling out for the special edition.\n\nI would recommend everyone stay away from this game until they fix all the bugs. Most ppl are going to hate the MyCareer story I feel - If they fix all the gameplay bugs then the game may be worth purchasing on discount so you can play with your online friends.

The dribble moves this year are awful and useless, pick and rolls don't work most of the time, plays are clunky and bad, and the AI defense is godlike.

Not bothering with this game anymore, the gameplay is simply terrible and anyone who states otherwise is playing on Rookie or Pro difficulty.

If you are a fan of the current NBA roster and teams might be good for you to pick up.\n\nHowever, for me, I'm just going to stick to 2k11.  As I'm not a pro at the game, and I'm not interested in my player, just team vs team and doing franchise seasons of 83 games 2k11 works for me still.\n\nThat game runs at 4k, still looks quite good, though not as realistic as 2k16.\n\nI'm too casual of a player of NBA games to jump to this version.\n\nIt piqued my interest because of the Michael Jordan edition, however for an MJ experience 2k11 still wins in that regard with Jordan challenges and the teams included.\n\nI usually buy a 2K bball game every 5 years as usually enough has changed by that time for the game to feel very fresh for me.\n\nMaybe I'll buy 2k17 next year, depends on the changes.","February 14","true","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dakriid/recommended/370240/","dakriid","Kriidztofer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dakriid/","167 products in account","Note: I am a huge basketball fan (been watching basketball since 1999, when I was 4). Also, I've played basketball while growing up and I've played numerous editions of basketball games (ie. NBA live 00-2008; NBA 2k8-16). Because of this, certain aspects of the game I really enjoy may be something that a casual gamer may find frustrating and unenjoyable.\n\nPros1) the AI GREATLY improved\nUnlike previous versions, it no longer takes waggling the right stick to break down the defender. It feels MUCH more rewarding to actually break down the AI defense. The AI will no longer "ballhog" on offense either. They will pass the ball and call screens more oftenly forcing you to constantly switch defenders to prevent the open basket.\n\n2)MyGM and MyLeague: Developing Players has gotten much better\nEvery player now actually has a potential around a B+ rating. Only stars have potentials of an A+/A. This is huge because in the past, any scrub could suddenly be a 90 rated player within 3-4 years. Now some players with a potential of an A may never pan out in the NBA. This feels a lot more realistic.\n\n3)MyGM Level Upgrades are no longer broken\nPreviously in 2k14-15, MyGM upgrades were ridiculously broken. For instance, there would be badges that add +5 to certain attributes (which is HUGE). In 2k16, the upgrades are toned down preventing your team from ALWAYS finishing first. In the previous games, this was SOOOO bad that you could take 50-60 rated players and go on 6 peats with them.\n\n4)New Cap Introduced\n2k added the new cap space. Basically to TL;DR it, the new deal the NBA has is a TV deal that raises the cap space. This is the reason why currently there are NBA players who are mostly role players with large contracts (in comparison to the past). The new TV deal makes the contract percentage wise smaller. This is in MyLEague and MyGM.\n\n5)RELOCATION\nYou can relocate your team and redesign everything about it from the sounds that go off during a game to the logo and the jerseys.\n\n6)MyPlayer - Season 2 and beyond\nMyPlayer after season 1 is better than previous versions. You can choose what to do on a daily basis. You no longer feel forced into certain interactions. They also reintroduced contract negotiations (which I have not seen since 2k13). Basically, you're able to negotiate for either higher minutes or higher salary with teams interested in you. Push too hard and these teams may back out.\n\n7)MyPlayer - High School and College\nDifficulty goes up as you move up (ie. in the first game of HS, you can score like 40 points without even trying but in college, you actually have to try). Kinda fun to smash on HS kids and feel like a God for a few games. College is interesting because we haven't had a basketball college game since CH 2k8 and NCAA 2010 so... yeah.\n\nCons\n1)Livin' Da Dream\nSeriously, this is THE worst storyline ever created. It's cringeworthy AF. You play as Freq, a kid from a black family from Harlem who basically moves up from being a local talented phenom to a rising star in the NBA. No matter what race YOU are, you're stuck with this black family. Cutscenes were long, dragged out, and made it FEEL like you had power to control what was going on but you really don't. Only good thing about this was that 2k allows you to skip the cutscenes.\n\n2)MyGM and MyLeague contracts\nYeah... players are signing for way too little. For instance, in 2025 there was a new TV deal that allowed me to sign players for more money. Playing as the Timberwolves, KAT signed a 5 year contract for $20 million a year. This was ridiculously low in comparison to other players who signed $40 mill a year contracts. Note that KAT was a 93 overall. His signing was so low I was able to bring in like 3-4 more star players. Kinda ruins the realism as you're forced to play with House Rules (ie. force a huge contract on KAT to make it seem more "realistic" or not sign mult. star players)\n\n3)MyPlayer - VC reliant compared to the past\nIn the past, you were able to just play MyPlayer without spending a dime. I was forced to grind MyGM games and the My2K Mobile Game to get VC. You start as a 59 rookie. In comparison, most other rookies are in the 70s. The game feels kinda weak because of this. You're always touted to be the "next great thing" and you can barely dribble the ball without it bouncing off of your foot.... Yeah, some HoFer you are.\n\n4)Online is dead\nNot really blaming 2k for this as the majority of the community plays on the PS4 and the Xb1. I've played a grand total of 1 Play Online game and it took about 10 minutes of searching to even get in. Unless you plan on playing with a friend, I don't recommend the online at all.\n\n5) Bugs, Bugs, Bugs\nThe same bugs since 2k10 still exist in this game. I'm talking about players flying through the backboard (like they just clip through it as if it doesn't exist), the Who-To-Guard icon constantly switching around, as well as Announcers saying the wrong things (ie. "I think the team has a great chance of coming back", "I Agree, X team is not playing well" when X team is up by 30 points with 1 minute left in th game).\n\n6)Kinda unfriendly to Noobs\nCommon since 2k15 (can't really remember if it was in 2k14) instead of a mentor-training system teaching you the controls, there are videos that really just give you the basics. My friend who never played a 2k game before struggled until i took pity on him and taught him how to do stuff like post-up.\n\nP.S Directional Passing still sucks... use icon passing. Just memorize what position you want to pass to. Ex: Point guards are always A on the Xbox Controller, B is always SG, X is always SF, Y is always PF, and LT is always Centers. Ez pz,\n\nOverall and Final Thoughts2k16 is possibly one of the better NBA 2k games released recently. 2k really upped their game as they fixed certain aspects of the game. If you never played a NBA 2k game and you want to buy one for the PC, I recommend 2k16 over all the other ones. Note that 2k14 on PC is NOT the ps4 and xb1 version, it is the PS3, X360 version. If you solely play MyPlayer, I personally do not recommend this game and instead i suggest NBA 2k15. Despite that game's flaws, the MyPlayer was still solid. I feel that the pros of MyPlayer in 2k16 don't really outweigh the Cons.\n\nOverall Game: 9/10MyGM/MyLeague: 9.5/10MyPlayer: 6/10Online: N/A\n\nTL;DRGame good. MyPlayer not good. Online is non-existent unless you're super lucky, play at certain hours, or you have a ample friendlist who wants to play.","February 21","true","99.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The whole "Livin Da Dream"  Is a complete waste.  While some aspects are nice, I.E free agency and player interactions after year one.  All in all not worth the time.  People want to play "themselves" not You cookie cutter version of what a nba phenom should be.  Gameplay is ok, player movements are still clunky to say the least but its the best out.  One thing that is still frusterating but will not change is the pay to win approach.  Gone are the days were you played games and practiced to improve and build your character.  I would be lying if it didnt feel like the certian "speed bumps" in gameplay werent introduced to nudge you towards spending more.  Servers have always been an issue with online play, so wont beat that dead horse.  My franchise is fun but again, C.R.E.A.M.  money = wins.  Hope this helps.

I read the reviews, which a lot of them were negative.  Well, I have major regrets that I didn't listen to the reviews.  THIS GAME IS FLAT OUT HORRIBLE!!!  It seems like the devolopers spent all their time on the story portition & no time at all on the actual game play of the game.  The game play is just awful!  The players move very slow, which means you will lose your guy on defense very easliy (even in turbo mode).  The controller settings are a little different from 2k15, so you'll have to get used to them.  When you pick your player on the court, it feels like you're a robot & not a player.  NBA 2k15 was much different.  You felt like an actual player on the court and were a part of the game, not just some robot running around (slowly) not doing much.  I was going to return it, but I thought maybe I was being to critical, so I gave it more and more chances.  Now I can't return it, and I will most likely go back to NBA 2k15.  This pisses me off, because I want the roster to be up to date, but I guess I gotta sacrafice a new roster for better (a lot better) gameplay.  I don't know what the developers were thinking releasing this crap.

It didn't work. I couldn't play the game for atleast a month. I had to be in touch with the customer service with 3-4 diffenrent people which got annoying during time because I had to explain what I had done etc. to each person. The fault was 2Ks. They fixed the bugs after awhile so I could play and I was disapointed.\n\nI am playing MyCareer only and loved the nba 2k15 MyC, it was visually good, gameplay was fun and you could be the hero who made the shots that were ment to actually go in. This year I desided to make a Shooting Guard, who was just focused on shooting. My SG is now 81 overall, 85 shooting, 50layup, passing 40 or something.\n\n1. Shooting (85). I can't make any shots that are open. This shooter shouldn't be in the nba, fact. I haven't even tried to do contact shots since I can't even make open shots. (tried different animations Kobe, Klay and some free ones. Didn't have any impact. Simulation, default, casual doesn't matter. I tried if the sliders worked, nothing. And I'm playing on Superstar, im no rookie, HoF in 2k15)\n\n2. Layups. This guy should definetly not be in the nba. This guy misses every layup even on a fast break alone and he manages to miss a layup. 50 layup shouldn't be that critical on that point.\n\n3. Passing. Man I can make every pass. Don't boost your passing skill since it is useless. (Unless you want to make traffic lobs)\n\n4. Dripple. It's so sluggish. Dripple is extremely hard because the guy doesn't follow your controls at all. (Can be fixed with dirrenent animations, maybe? But if this is true, 2K, delete the rest of the animations because they are useless so stop making more of them)\n\nSpike Lee start off was kinda boring since it didn't have any inpact on the gameplay, just some random cutscenes.\n\n2K, You really don't have to make the game more "realistic" with the scoring % because it makes the game extremely unrealistic when you can't make buckets that even I would do under preassure and exhaustion. I don't even play basketball. 2k15 to 2k16 was just a cheese fix patch.\n\nIf you are considering buying this game, don't do it. Online is fun but if you want to play MyCareer it will ♥♥♥♥ you the f off. 2k15 was great and I'm going to start playing that instead of this. Maybe 2k17 will be better, who knows? Listen to the community before you buy it though. I wasted my 50e and I actually regret it.\n\nNBA fan from Finland","February 20","false","84.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was going to return it, but I thought maybe I was being to critical, so I gave it more and more chances.  Now I can't return it, and I will most likely go back to NBA 2k15.  This pisses me off, because I want the roster to be up to date, but I guess I gotta sacrafice a new roster for better (a lot better) gameplay.  I don't know what the developers were thinking releasing this crap.  Next time I'm going to listen to the reviews...  ;(","February 1","false","120.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The lack of playing has left my player still in the 50's as I am unable to improve the player if I can't play with him.  I've only played this game for a handful of hours but I am ready to uninstall and spend my time on something that I will actually enjoy.

The only difference is the MyCareer mode they did all the advertisement on with Spike Lee, but it's really really REALLY bad. Literally the worst ♥♥♥♥ ever. I had a feeling the Spike Lee thing would fail hard and it did. No choices at all for you to make in a mode that is supposed to be "MyCareer." Spike Lee wrote a script and they force your player down the road of his ill-written gibberish.\n\nThey don't even allow you to choose the NBA team you begin your career on, taking away some of the freedom you had in the previous game. And the first 7 games you play in High School and College go 100% unrewarded. You don't get any gold to improve your player and drafted out of college you are the worst player in the NBA alongside being the worst rookie out of your draft class. The first NBA season of your career? Lasts 8 games.

First of all, gameplay is great. Most of  the player movement is realistic but there are few animations that are apsurd and some exploits that some users take advantage of, and of course cheaters. MyCareer was interesting when played for the 1st time but it is very repetitive and boring at times.\n\nPro Am is fantastic, in somewhat ways. The worst part of it is that if you want to play Pro Am solo is very difficult to find players, especially during day because it has really terrible matchmaking. This is the worst part of the whole NBA and is needed to be addressed in future releases. Making something like general chat in each game mode is the key to improving the gameplay for players.\n\nAll of the above said is really a small part of this game and is ignorable because this game has so many great features which you will enjoy like never before, and I am saying this after playing since NBA 2k9.","April 14","true","405.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I played 2K14, and thought it was ok. I play it solely from a MyCareer standpoint, and the MyCareer in this one does have a better story than 2k14, but it drags on in the cutscenes and you don't make any decisions for your life outside of basketball. The voice acting is good, but the animations and expressions often don't fit, and that's not a fault to the actors, its just down to shoddy graphics.\n\nThe gameplay itself has actually downgraded since 2K14. The AI behind the players is even more stupid, and the controls are even worse. I found my player switching positions with the target he was supposed to guard, despite the fact he was supposed to playing hard defense. Wide open shots that should go in, just don't. The shot timing is a little more aggravating in this game than 2k14, and in 2k14 it could be rather aggravating. The only good thing is the updated rosters from what I saw.\n\nAll in all, don't get it unless you really want to play basketball, but are either too lazy to play real basketball or are tired from playing it.","March 17","false","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm an Basketball/NBA fanatic.\ni have played NBA 2k series since 2k11\nSo i think i know what im talking about.\n\n-Rating-\nGraphics - 9/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nStory - 1/10\nSoundtrack - Dont care about that. but 10/10 as allways\n\n-Pros-\n-Best Basketball game this year, well there is no competition, well i guess NBA live 16 lol.\n-As allways addicting\n-Online is so much fun.\n-MyTeam is great.\n-Nice looking game with great animations.\n-MyGm/MyLeague great game modes\n\n-Cons-\n-Worst my career ever... You cant play in your rookie season...well... you can like 8 games. I liked the highschool and collage part but the story is just simple Sh** , you just want to skip it, dialogueis cringy as hell, well it was written by Spike Lee nothing more to expect... i like the off days option to do things you would like and i like the "Live practice" but one thing is missing from that... you cant improve your attributes by going to live practice like you could have in 2k11, you will just get a boost and xp thats it and you can earn a little vc like 50. Upgrading attributes- i hate it, those upgrade bars or what ever you call it , its stupid, bring the simple old one.\n-Gameplay- has so many flaws , pick and rolls are the worst , and each update they try to fix it before updates it was good enough you could live with that , 1st update broke every AI play would reach on pass and you couldnt get the pass trought on the 2nd one they made it great again, 3rd one i dont know, and now i think 4th its bad , seems like noone can set a screen , Noel, Cousins,Okafor or any other center cant do a screen they will catch contact with like 5th screen every  one who plays basketball knows if you set a screen you have to catch the player so the defender will switch, but dude sets the screen away from the player so the defender would go over the screen untouched, like what the hell and if the screen works the bigman would run away from the basket and wont get into position, so pick and roll is not effective at all.\n-Should be more options to get VC, by playing MyGm for example.\n-Passing should be fixed if a dude is wide open next to you and you point at him and pass the pass will go across the court to another dude that is defended by 2 defenders ... like why ....\n.\nMyTeam wise the game improved alot and its soo fun to play, but this might be the worst MyCareer experience ever, it will make you more mad than happy... Didnt try MyPark yet, but when i upgrade my player i will.\n\nOverwall just for updates that simply doesnt add alot, for bad MyCareer, for stupid AI , for cringy story and for most of all this game costs 50 euros and at most this game should cost 25... so for all that i will give it a NO. BUT.... BUTT... ha butt .. But if it costs 16-22 euros buy it its worth that, play MyTeam mode and live happly :)","June 4","false","22.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I expected the graphics to be a lot better, but they are actually pretty bad, it doesn't run in 1080p which bothers me because there is a lot of pixel work you can see. Also the game is really buggy and it's hard for me to get through cut scenes in the game without it glitching or freezing. There is also a lot of bugs in this game, like the sound cutting out and the commentators voices stop playing. Also the online portion of this game is absolutely horrible, majority of the people hack on this game and you have to face people who are taller, faster and stronger than you and it just sucks. Basically, I bought this game expecting it to be better and I just really didn't like it at all. If you're thinking of buying this game, and are looking at the reviews for it, I suggest not buying it. It is a waste of money to buy on PC. If you are really in to basketball and like the NBA series, I suggest buying it for console, it would be 10x better.

As well as some few good things that they don't seem to keep from their previous titles.\n\n1. Commentators cut off during the game sometimes. Commentary starts again at the next quarter.\n\n2. Referees sometimes just sit there with the ball for half a minute before giving it to you.\n\n3. There also seems to be problems with the VC sometimes not reaching the server properly.\n\n4. (Personal) I want the option to make a fantasy team with just the playoffs, whether it be MyGM or MyLeague. This was done in a previous 2K title. I don't know why they got rid of the option.\n\nOverall, almost nothing has changed from 2k15. I mean, there were a few changes that has inevitably made the game better (ie. speed mechanics, blocking fouls are now shooting fouls), and I understand that graphically theres only so much more they can do.\n\nIt feels like there's way too much emphasis on MyCareer, if ONLY for the fact they earn more money from it. I would love to give you more money for your titles, if you released a title worthy of it. This to me tells me that the developers don't care much for the fans except for their money, and how to exploit that fact. But honestly this game is just 2k15 with different controls. Please at least fix the bugs before releasing your next game.","November 1, 2015","false","60.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Keywords: Right now. Although the gameplay is better than recent installments, and the gamemodes continue to improve, the PC Port has a myriad of issues I can't recommend anyone go through without waiting for a fix.\n\nFirst of all, the game crashes. A lot. I mean, a lot. Sometimes you click on options, it crashes. You edit a player, it crashes. It's completely random but not uncommon at all.\n\nSecond, the menus are horribly designed and even have glitches where regardless of restarting the game you can't see things under a black screen. Example: I play primarily MyGM mode, and the relocation features are fantastic, but break nearly every time I try to use them. You can't change uniforms, arena designs, or anything even if you restart. I haven't even had luck with creating a new MyGM file. This is completely inexcusable and ruins the game when things literally don't work.\n\nAnd third, the gameplay optimization is very very poor. It runs dedicated graphics, instead of your graphics card. You have to manually change the setting to nvidia (in my experience) via the control panel on my computer. My laptop is pretty nice, I do solid gaming on it (950M Nvidia, 16 gb RAM, i7, it's brand new) and it chugs sometimes. I literally have no clue why, even after turning down the settings. I really think that based on the Steam reviews 2K will have to take a look at the PC port and fix issues with it on their own.\n\nIf these issues are fixed soon, I definitely recommend the game as a whole. It has everything, it's just that some of it doesn't work.","September 27, 2015","false","67.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

It crashes constantly, the VC store is down, and even worse the myCareer option is NOTHING like it used to be. Its just a stupid movie and you have to follow it. First off it took me 3 hours to set the game up because it kept crashing so I hd to scour the message boards looking for ways to fix it (turns out you have to run windowed mode, turn down AA, and turn of Super Sampling, what the heck???), people online are already using the same exploits 2K knew about last year so instead of fixing it they just shut down parts of the game, and the worst part of all is the blatant racist story line. They force your character to be an "african american" kid, living in the projects of Harlem, with a twin sister who is black. I am Asian and this is myCareer! How the heck is my family a poor black family from the Harlem Project? This story line is set and unlike last year you can't make ANY decisions, its all done by Spike Lee. All this game is, is a Spike Lee movie and I'm not going to watch stereotypical black gangta's ballers, with a Kim Kardhashian gold digger gf, who fights with his over bearing, in your face, ghetto, attitude twin sisters, while your evil, greedy, trying to talk with hood slangs, Italian mobster agent runs around.

They could have easely made it so that you family changed race depending on you, made you choose your own nickname.. all that said and done, the player progression and ranking on winning highschool games, to get diffrent scholarships, and playing well in colledge to get draftet higher is one of the best way the game has handled the preseasen i think. and after your rookie season you get the nba2k16 mycareer with alot more features, so concluding that mycareer is the best it has ever been, but 2k needs to know that a movie directer, havent got a clue what makes a story good for a video game.","September 30, 2015","false","41.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Also the online portion of this game is absolutely horrible, majority of the people hack on this game and you have to face people who are taller, faster and stronger than you and it just sucks.

Although if someone paid me that much money I'd probably say that even right now.\n\nDON'T BUY IT.\n\nOk now, I've played my career enough to hate this game\n\nThe rules state and I quote "Contact initiated by the defensive player guarding a player with the ball is not legal.\nThis contact includes, but is not limited to, forearm, hands, or body check". So If a defender charges to me and im not moving, that should not be a foul.\n\nExcept it always is, always. Especially in the layup attempts. I don't seem to get such fouls.\n\nMy teammates have a basketball IQ of 25. Say Someone got their shot blocked and it went out of bounds in my halfcourt. The guy inbounds immediately, giving me the only chance of a hail mary.\n\nAlso they miss wide open layups, their body movement while finishing a play always say "BLOCK MY ♥♥♥".\n\nDid i say I always miss wide open shots while my shot meter is very close to centre? (sometimes green releases too)\n\nGotta mention, you cannot skip in-game cutscenes (such as timeouts, free throw prep stuff, the black and white matchup animation etc.)\n\nYou cannot sim to offdays is another annoying thing\n\nI am in Miami right now and in the game i just finished, Luol Deng inbounded into the backboard twice.\n\nI will still play this game from time to time but my last message is this.\n\n♥♥♥♥ YOU 2K FOR WASTING HOURS OF MY LIFE\n\nUpdate: On a scale from Einstein to the devs, I think teammate IQ is much more resembling to the devs. If I want my SG to carry it while playing a PG, what he does is pass it back to me immediately.

It's weird being Asian and being surrounded by a black family, calling me "Freq."

Well, 3 months have passed since the release of the game and it's the first time when it's fully playable (in my terms).  What's happenned?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkHitman83/recommended/370240/","DarkHitman83","Tenchu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkHitman83/","19 products in account","This game is semi-good , semi-bad.\n\nFirst of all , it has improved a lot from last years. From graphics , to better gameplay and structure of the mods this game has been the best nba 2k game so far. The models look more realistic than ever , gameplay feels a lot smoother but it has some flaws (more on that later). Defense has been improved a lot. There are a lot more animations and these make the game feel like a true NBA game. The atmosphere of the matches is good. Especially in moments where the score is in a critical condition and every move determines the final outcome of the game. You can feel the crowd . It breathes energy and "motivation " , so to say. One thing I really liked is the fact that If the home team loses by a lot , then you start seeing the fans leave the stadium and you end up with like 1k spectators or less. A small detail , yet a great one.\nThe commentators also do a great job both on the post-game and pre-game shows as well as in the game. Pre-game shows are very entairtaining to watch and they effectively fill the time you to wait for the game to load. In-game , commentators do a great job at transferring the atmosphere of the game to you , the player. Although some lines get repeated a lot and I would like to be monthly updates to them. Aside from these things , some things I also like is that every team has the right coach , a full-modeled character, and not a common one to all teams. In timeouts coaches talk to you and ask various things such as pressure more or shoot more , etc. . Also the soundtrack is good although it feels like it needs more tracks , a thing that may be asserted in the next game. It contains music from different genres , with Rap being the leading one.\n\nNow to modes : I will only talk about MyCarrer and MyTeam because these are the ones that I have only played.\n\nMyCareer:\nMyCareer is pretty solid for another year , with the exception of the Spike Lee addition. And that's where the mode starts showing some problems. For example,  you feel like you dont have a lot of freedom . It's more restricted in comparison with the previous games. Your family and friends are black (no intention of racism) and that's awkward when you made your player a white person. Maybe Spike Lee oversaw that and didn't fix it. But aside from that you basically follow a premade story and you cant do anything to change it. I found the story interesting and I liked the fact that we had the chance to play college games. Even though they were small in duration , they were pretty fun. After finishing with the Spike Lee story , MyCareer gets a lot more interesting. Endorsements are a great addition to the game and a big reason to keep you in the game for a long time. Practise manages it as well. (although not in the same degree as endorsements)\n\nMyTeam:\nMyTeam is the game mode that's held me the most on this game. Almost all my game-hours are spent on this mode. It's fun , interesting and you have to think sometimes on how to make the most out of your auctions and so on. I really like opening packs whenever I have the money , even though pack odds are not very good, something that definitely needs to be considered heavily in the next NBA2k. Then you have the auction house. AH plays a huge role in the mode. It's  basically the one that determine if you're gonna be rich or not. You need to think sometimes on how to handle your auctions , like when to sell them , how much , etc. Modes are good too. Domination is definitely the mode you want to start with. After you complete it ,something that's not so difficult to do, you can hop in to Road To The Playoffs mode. There you play online with other players so make sure you have a good team. Gauntlet is another online mode too. Even though they are fun modes to play , the lack of stable servers makes them really nerve-racking and make you rage a lot. And that's a serious reason why some people quit the game. A lot of times I have found myself lagging for no reason and get thrown out of the game , thus losing it . This is a problem that needs to be immediately addressed in the next game.\nAlso 2k has to do something about people that buy mt from 3rd - party sites. It makes the AH go nuts and prices go way higher than they were supposed to be and that's causing the players to feel frustrated and quit trying.\n\nOverall , I recommend NBA 2k16 to everyone that like sports games , and just wants to have fun. MyTeam is guaranteed to keep a lot of players busy with the game. Even though a lot of problems need to be addressed in NBA 2k17 ,  2k16 still remains a pretty solid choice for NBA lovers.","February 13","true","292.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For example I got stuck in the sub bench when there was a goal scored and my player ran of field. I glitched myself out and luckily my team was attacking, else we would've been a man short defending which is a big problem with basketball.\n\nGameplay is really good, although I really don't get the hang of the defending and good dribbles. But that is probably my own mistake by being not experienced with these NBA games for a long time. Also I didn't play with actual teams a lot, and started out with a self made player. So that's probably a big factor as well.\n\nThe story line in my career is pretty fun, but I got really tired over the pre game shows and after shows. First few times it's not that bothering, unless you play a few hours after each other. Yes it is nice when they talk about you, but I just want to play.\n\nAll in all I think people who like basketball will like this game as well. I think the biggest bugs are solved(?), since the sub bench thing only happened at the start of the play and then never again. Didn't really experience any major bugs further or crashes. So yeah, I'd reccommend this game if you're a basketball fan, if not you should wait for the next sale.","February 16","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kind of a grind, but I don't mind that. I don't want to be an all star out the gate. But they should've let you have higher stats when making it to the NBA based on success of previous matches. The only crap MyCareer has shown is that if you sim a game, you lose all the off days afterward. Found that out the hard way losing a sposorship and 3 offdays early into the career. Painful.\n\nMyGM has been good. The SimCast is cool if you just want to coach and change strageties.\n\nMyTeam has been absolutely unplayable for me. Whenever I finish a domination game I receive the error that "arbitration is taking too long" and the only option is to cancel the game results. This has happened after multiple attempts. I let the window sit there thinking it will catch up, but nothing. So you get no results and the only way to receive packs is to communicate with the server and they seem to suck.\n\nI love MyGM and MyCareer is ok. I can't understand how this server problem is so consistent. Look at all the hate that it gets. You will understand if you get it. If you don't mind missing a big chunk of a pretty expensive game, then I'm sure you'll love this game. 2k MyTeam servers have doomed this games reviews.","February 8","false","56.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They give you no chance at being semi decent in your first season, and the 'practices' in the second season are garbage.  Spike Lee's story doesn't add to the value, especially when it is obviously built around you being a member of the black harlem community and the character you build does not fit into that scheme, *cough* *cough*.  Defending a player is terrible, you will be playing perfect defense for ten seconds and then the guy somehow blows by you and the 'my career' grade for the game is destroyed by one misstep.  It also dings you for not covering your guy when the arrow at the bottom of your character is changing its mind every 1/2 second as to who you should be covering.

Teaming up with other players picking a court etc. It's really fun. Graphically this game is very nice.\nPeople that have played 2K15 and disliked this game. I can't really give an opinion on that.\nMainly because this is my first NBA 2K game.\nBut if you like a sports game. Basketball game.

This year's addition was definitely an improvement in gameplay yet the PC port was ♥♥♥♥ poor and little effort or comittment was made for the PC. It's inferior in a lot of ways that the consoles don't experience. I get that it's harder to optimize for multiple systems but my expectations are heightened when I pay 60 dollars for a game. The same price that someone on console pays, I expect the same quality and you don't get that here. I can't even play the game anymore and I refuse to support them on PC as of now. I'm honestly done with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The only way I'd pay for it was if they knocked the price down upon RELEASE. Either that or take the route WWE went and release the game at a later date than on console for a more polished release.

I've played a lot of basketball simulations and in this case, NBA 2k16 is certainly one of the, if not THE best game ever to be released. Why the hesitation, then, u might ask. Well, 3 months have passed since the release of the game and it's the first time when it's fully playable (in my terms).  What's happenned? Looks like 2K Sports decided to give us an incomplete product and made us pay for the beta-testing of it. I'm pretty mad about this fact, and I'm not sure if I wanna' do it again. Probably not. Not to be baseless, I'll give you some examples of my negative experience with the game:\n-invisible players, not allowing me to do almost anything against them since their actions are unpredictable(on- and offline)\n-fps drops\n-sound stopping in the middle of the game, not returning at all, or after a few quarters\n-lots of connection problems with the servers\n-black, instead of colourful floors of the arenas, 3pt line not visible\n-gameplay things like still being defended hardly after passing the rival in animation.\nAnd I haven't even played the MyCareer and other modes than Exhibition, as I'm not that much interested in them, so I've got no clue how many errors are awaiting me in there. After all, the gameplay is really, really nice (but that's what we got used to when playing 2k sport games). Nonetheless, this is the first time when those errors have occurred, and I suppose I can't give the game a positive vote. Maybe next year.

The story line makes no sense, the characters are dull and annoying, people keep calling your character Freq which makes you feel like you’re not playing as yourself but some dumb ♥♥♥♥ guy with a dumb ♥♥♥♥ nickname. Your whole rookie season is practically wasted, Vic and his crazy idiocy just makes me want to punch my monitor. Your character’s sister is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, she wants to control everything, she even called Freq’s girlfriend a GOLD DIGGER when she herself is making money off her brother. Speaking of Freq’s family, they are all ♥♥♥♥ing black and so if your character is white you’ll have a ♥♥♥♥ing twin sister who’s black, what were they thinking? When you go from college to pro you’re agent kept talking like you had a choice to stay in college if you want to. The cut scene ends with Freq saying I’ll think about it but next, BAM you’re in the ♥♥♥♥ing NBA draft. This year’s draft was horrible they just went through it with pictures of the drafted players. Then everybody around you keep talking about how Vic is a bad influence but they don’t give us a choice to continue to be friends with Vic, they ♥♥♥♥ing killed him off for Christ sake, what’s the point of those cut scenes then? There was one scene where Freq had a long talk with Vic in the car and NOTHING ♥♥♥♥ing happened! They talked a lot of ♥♥♥♥ which ended so awkwardly and makes you feel like what the ♥♥♥♥ have I just watched for 10 minutes??? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? Everything about this story sucks! Most importantly how are some people ok with that ♥♥♥♥ing Frequency Vibration ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? I thought this is supposed to me MyCareer, all we got was a ♥♥♥♥ing Freq Career or some horse ♥♥♥♥. I had absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing say for my character. I’ll be honest this is the WORST MyCareer I have ever seen! To sum up, the entire story was nothing but lama ♥♥♥♥ talk, the characters were boring and ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, the cut scenes were so long and pointless, the ending was that your ♥♥♥♥ing friend died from a car crash. What is Spike Lee trying to say?\nAside from the story, the gameplay in MyCAREER sucks as well, you start off as pretty good player in high school, then in college you might start experiencing some difficulties to play as good, then in the NBA you’re a complete ♥♥♥♥-tard who has a 55 overall rating. I had to redo the game, buy a lot of VC and boost up my player to about an 80 overall. I play as a 6’8 small forward and holy ♥♥♥♥ I can only max out my speed to a 70. Like really bruh 70, Kevin Durant’s way taller than 6’8 and he don’t run that slow. ♥♥♥♥ing 70 man how am I suppose to chase down a fast break or something. One ♥♥♥♥ing thing, I had this 80 rating before my first high school game. And in high school and college I was fast, but after I got into the NBA I suddenly became slow as ♥♥♥♥, what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the people who made this game. How can a player suddenly decrease so much speed when they transit to pro, where’s the logic. And ♥♥♥♥ if you’re teammate is wearing then number you want to wear you can’t ♥♥♥♥ing wear it like previous installments.\n2K, I have never been so let down and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ playing your game. I am writing this review because I’ve been playing since 2K7 and I really have NEVER EVER EVER been so disappointed. I genuinely love NBA 2K but seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ happened this year, you guys completely took the hype and ♥♥♥♥ on our faces. This is the worst MyCareer I’ve ever seen you guys don’t even let us choose our body types anymore.","September 24, 2015","false","316.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

It has it's bugs and issues, but it is the most real to life version of NBA 2k ever.\n\nPROS\n-2k did a great job this year of reducing the "cheese" in every way (It is VERY hard to draw charges, run baseline for an easy 2, or pull up for a contested 3 and knock it down for example)\n-You feel like you are in complete control of your players much more than last year, mainly because you rarely are ever stuck in animations\n-It isn't easy to score. This might sound bad, but this makes the game so much better. As I'm sure some people remember in 2k15, RT+X to the basket or shooting a 3 with any half decent 3pt shooter gave you a free basket.\n-Excellent graphics, the best looking sports game I have ever seen.\n-Fluid and varied gameplay, overall fun to play with many different modes, difficulties, and playstyles\n-Much better connection to servers/lag issues than previous years\n-Music/overall atmosphere- pregame/postgame show with Shaq, Ernie, and Kenny is great. The music is a wide variety of genres and cultures, mainly hip-hop and rap however so if you arent into that kind of music you can turn it off\n-Lots of settings/options, very customizeable and in some gamemodes you can even adjust gameplay sliders (percentage of 3's going in for example)\n-VERY ACCURATE RATINGS. This is so important, because many cards last year had extremely over-boosted ratings, which contributed a lot to the "cheese"\n\nCONS\n-Some framerate issues, especially in cutscenes, but I have a 750 ti and I'm doing fine framerate wise with some medium, some high settings\n-"BE THE STORY" except all you do in mycareer is follow the exact storyline Spike Lee has laid out for you, rarely being able to ever make your own decisions\n-Sometimes the game can be frusturating, players missing wide open shots when it seems like you should make it or things like that\n-Lots of bugs unrelated to gameplay, cards having the wrong ratings (Rookie vince carter has the same ratings as the 15+years later vince carter) and other things like that, but im sure these will be fixed\n\nOverall- 9/10, I really recommend this game to anyone who remotely enjoys basketball, I don't watch the NBA all that much but I love me some 2k.","October 3, 2015","true","660.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

You're pretty much restricted to following stereotypes and being a black NBA player which is a little racist itself. And the career mode is very buggy and my game crashes multiple times, it doesnt even allow me to pick my college to go to because it always crashes when I try to pick one.

HE SHOULD'VE DUNK THE BALL AND THIS GUY INTO THE RIM !!!\n\nTell me WHY amethyst Steph Curry (MVP Version), can't make open 3 (like two in the row? it's hard for him? - I'm not talkin about one game, it's regular). Game full of scripts like shooting threes 3/5 so its like MAKE,MISS,MAKE,MISS,MAKE, and then missing almost all shots and going 4/13 in game. Can't go 5/5, or get any green release after 3/5 with the best shooter in the history. AGAIN REALLY ?!\n\nThough on the opposite team, Diamond Dwight Howard from Magic can hit free throws like a crazy mother♥♥♥♥**. HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE? Had seen those type of situations with my players like Ben Wallace, and he's making 8/8. Don't remember when he did it in real life. Maybe once, but not few times going through the seed...\n\nI'm so fired up right now, I almost broke my controller and almost rage quit.\nNow I know, don't want to waste my time, PLAYING THIS GAME IS NOT PLEASURE FOR ME ANYMORE. I MEAN FU** THIS GAME. Graphics and all the stuff ain't ♥♥♥♥ .\nI'm definetely not buying 2k17 copy, I'm not that dumb, and I recommend you to do so.

At this point 2K16 isn't worth it.\nHere's why:\n\n-It's buggy... to put it simply, it has more performance problems than the previous year\n-Commentators cut out randomly in games, music sometimes plays and sometimes doesn't, and honsetly... while I'm talking about music... the playlist is pretty weak at points\n-The players respond to your actions and commands soooo slowly... you flick the stick right and ♥♥♥♥ing curry responds like hes stuck in the mud or he's as quick as my 92 year old great grandmother.\n-Btw I love the spin move. This game will make you dislike it, loathe it, hateeeee it because of how slowly it responds.\n-Shot timing is considerably slower and harder to get used to then on a console\n-2K added cool features for this year's game, but then cut tons of corners in places like arena design and other things\n-The Spike Lee career mode story was cool, interesting to follow, sure, but I have two major problems. One: (nobody go and cry about this now it's a fact) the story mode is designed and intended only for a black audience. Typical Spike Lee ladies and gents. I understand exactly why he was chosen to do this, but cmon. There's a huge audience that gets the story mode ruined for them because it makes no sense at all. I've got a pastey white, blonde-haired girly boy point guard who has a ghetto twin sister and speaks like DMX taught him the language. Second major problem with the career mode: IT SKIPS THE ♥♥♥♥ING ROOKIE SEASON. Any player development, records, acheivements, personal accomplishments, forget it, all of it gets condensed into 8 unfulfilling games. The game lets you play 8 games of your rookie season while bouncing back and fourth between the games and the Spike Lee story. The Career mode is amazing after the stupid Spike Lee distraction is over. I ould have a much less sour opinion if it didn't bite a chunk out of the actual game...","February 12","false","372.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

There's a lot more interaction than in 2k15 in terms of what to do on off-days and how to earn Virtual Currency (VC). The "Spike Lee Joint" is completely unnecessary, but starting in year 2 the game takes a huge leap foward and it becomes a real improvement over last year's encarnation of the mode. I'd recommend skipping every cutscene and just flying through year 1 ASAP. If you want to see the movie later, it's made available in your second year. It's not awful if you're a fan of Spike Lee, it's just way too much if you want to actually play a game. The entire cutscene film is nearly 2 full hours in length. That's ridiculous for a sports game.\n\nAll in all, a legitimate improvement over 2k15. I've heard online play is a mess, but I stick to single player.

I already played NBA 2K since 2K9 for the first time ever I disappointed with 2K Sport\n\nDon't get me wrong, there's some improvement this year. And this is a review based on the pre release date.\n\nPros :\n+ The gameplay animation and physics is good. I like it, feels more real now.\n+ More animation for players. More varieties of movements.\n+ Dunk feels more powerful\n+ Good concept idea on MyCareer (From High School to NBA Draft)\n+ AI is harder than last year. AI's Defense is more intense and quite hard to break\n\nCons :\n- Always crashing after half game of the 1st NBA Game of MyCareer. Now I can't continue MyCareer\n- Quite lagging compare to NBA2K15 with the same game spec\n- MyCareer storyline. You just played as Freq, it doesn't matter what's your name is, you always become Freq. What I enjoy about MyCareer from all the other 2K is I can be myself. Now it doesn't matter, it's Frequency Vibrations who will become the all star. And yes. that's your nickname Frequency Vibrations.\n- Some bug where suddenly pass icon just appeared out of nowhere, very annoying especially when I tried to shot and that pass icon suddenly appeared and I end up of passing.\n- Stuttering especially on commentator's talk. So lag and they are late to comments any action in court\n\nOf course I will recommended this game if 2K Games is already optimized this game, waiting for some patch and a new GPU driver that support this game. Let's see until the release date, if there's some optimizations and get better, this game is 100% recommended. it's fun\n\nBut for this pre release review it's a naaahh\nSorry 2K..

Add in Barkley next year, and it'll be worth it just for the pre-game/haltime/post-game shows.\n\nMyCareer is actually a lot of fun. There's a lot more interaction than in 2k15 in terms of what to do on off-days and how to earn Virtual Currency (VC). The "Spike Lee Joint" is completely unnecessary, but starting in year 2 the game takes a huge leap foward and it becomes a real improvement over last year's encarnation of the mode. I'd recommend skipping every cutscene and just flying through year 1 ASAP. If you want to see the movie later, it's made available in your second year. It's not awful if you're a fan of Spike Lee, it's just way too much if you want to actually play a game. The entire cutscene film is nearly 2 full hours in length. That's ridiculous for a sports game.\n\nAll in all, a legitimate improvement over 2k15. I've heard online play is a mess, but I stick to single player. If you're like me in that respect, give this a try.","February 14","true","70.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At this point 2K16 isn't worth it.\nHere's why:\n\n-It's buggy... to put it simply, it has more performance problems than the previous year\n-Commentators cut out randomly in games, music sometimes plays and sometimes doesn't, and honsetly... while I'm talking about music... the playlist is pretty weak at points\n-The players respond to your actions and commands soooo slowly... you flick the stick right and ♥♥♥♥ing curry responds like hes stuck in the mud or he's as quick as my 92 year old great grandmother.\n-Btw I love the spin move. This game will make you dislike it, loathe it, hateeeee it because of how slowly it responds.\n-Shot timing is considerably slower and harder to get used to then on a console\n-2K added cool features for this year's game, but then cut tons of corners in places like arena design and other things\n-The Spike Lee career mode story was cool, interesting to follow, sure, but I have two major problems. One: (nobody go and cry about this now it's a fact) the story mode is designed and intended only for a black audience. Typical Spike Lee ladies and gents. I understand exactly why he was chosen to do this, but cmon. There's a huge audience that gets the story mode ruined for them because it makes no sense at all. I've got a pastey white, blonde-haired girly boy point guard who has a ghetto twin sister and speaks like DMX taught him the language. Second major problem with the career mode: IT SKIPS THE ♥♥♥♥ING ROOKIE SEASON. Any player development, records, acheivements, personal accomplishments, forget it, all of it gets condensed into 8 unfulfilling games. The game lets you play 8 games of your rookie season while bouncing back and fourth between the games and the Spike Lee story. The Career mode is amazing after the stupid Spike Lee distraction is over. I ould have a much less sour opinion if it didn't bite a chunk out of the actual game...","February 12","false","372.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Sales for VC come up often and are usually pretty decent discounts (ex: 75% $10 amount).\n\nMyCareer sucks. You have hardly any control over your player. The High School and College games are very fun and atmospheric, but they're super short. If you're a white person like me, you get stuck into a black family and can't do anything about it. I wouldn't have an issue with it except for the fact that you have a TWIN SISTER that is also black. The main issue for me outside of the terrible story that you have no influence over is the fact that you can only play EIGHT games your rookie season! And even worse? YOU GO INTO FREE AGENCY AFTER THAT YEAR! I was #1 overall draft pick and I go into FA after the year?\n\nOverall the game is pretty good for gameplay. Jump shooters from midrange are the best, as layups and 3s have a pretty low chance of going in unless the player has high ratings.\n\nMyGM has a nice feature to relocate a team anywhere and completely rebrand it. I chose the Clippers and relocated them to Kansas City after a few years, overall it was a nice experience.\n\nAs for online-- I don't play sports games online as they ruin the game for me, but I've heard it's full of cheaters on PC and you'd be better off getting it on a console if you're going to play online.","May 30","true","80.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I liked this game for about 2 monthes until 2K decided to step in and mess stuff up again.  The MyCareer gameplay seems really awkward with people speeding up and slowing down the game at odd times in order to try and keep the game difficult.  Things like balls magically floating through my player when I jump a lane to steal.  It seems like the game restricts you from being unstoppable, throwing in weird glitches which I have taken pictures to prove.  Players on your team will start moving one way, glitch and move towards his defender, causing turnovers that leave me like, "what just happen?".  This gets quite annoying but as you can see, I am still a pretty avid user of this game.  It is addictive but honestly I just turn it off in the middle of the game when those weird momentum changes seem to be forced into the gameplay, forcing odd-looking turnovers, taller cpu teammates getting blocked and characters seemingly molding together, the player missing steals, cpu teammates missing wide open lay-ups.  The list goes on; and it only seems to have gotten worse lately with these updates.\nAlso, with the new updates I have noticed random crashing.  Once in the playoff's, I have crashed at the end of a game and then had to restart from the beginning when I reloaded myCareer.  I also tried to use the "Save and Quit" option in the menu; only for the game to crash, forcing the game to open a file from a previous save.  If it crashes and no previous save, quess what?  You're restarting the game.  I just recently lost an entire 3rd Quarter from this crash and it is not the first time.  The crashes seem to have become more frequent as the game has grown older; which is rather odd.\n\nOriginal Review:\nI seriously think 2K Sports are tipping off companies to boost sales and hype up this game.  I don't even know why I paid money for this game.  Mycareer is broken; missing wide open shots all the time with an 85 overall jump shot rating.  Not to mention missing uncontested lay-ups half the the time with 80+ overall rating for inside shooting; those are always great.  I respect Spike Lee but the story is completely wack and nobody cares about behind-the-scene stuff about how you produced this POS game.  Not to mention you can't skip cut scenes in between quarters, forcing you to watch pre-game and post-game videos which takes A LONG TIME TO DO ANYTHING.  After 2K's huge update, my replays stopped working, only showing scenes of the follow-up reactions after the play where your character is talking or whatever.  Who wants to watch that, seriously?  Vsync causes a lot of visual tearing and was the only fix I could come up with for the replay problems.  So now my replays work, but the crowd stutters and everything looks choppy and poorly animated.  I played this game and gave it plenty of times and opportunities to impress me but it's terrible.  Mycareer would be awesome if the gameplay wasn't completely messed up; the calender system and customization aspects are much better than last year.  Yet, I haven't even tried any other aspect of the game besides mycareer because this game frustrated me to the point of no return.  Like I said it's a waste of money.  All the missed shots, choppy framerate, and bugs are a constant reminder.\n\n3570k @ 4.1 Ghz\nAsus GTX960\nX-Box One Controller","January 2","false","361.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Amazing...if you could actually play on them. Is playable but has alloottt of lag. Like fr. Still waiting for that preorder key for the pre-ordering bonus. ): still didn't get it.\n\nMy career? Terrible story. You are forced to be African-American (No problem with that) with an African American family, with one voice, as well as a terrible name (Frequency Vibrations [Freq]) and cannot create an individual character such as pale skinned, or tanned. You can't customize your character fully because of Spike Lee's stereotypical scenario which puts you into this "world" that is already pre-set.\n\nSo gonna say. 2k Realized they needed to step up their game, brought in Spike Lee to make it happen. Didn't happen the way I wanted it to, but oh well. Graphics are majorly improved, but have more lag. Servers are trash right now. Multiplayer would be fun if nothing was hacked. Mycareer is just );< Could've been way more better in terms of the "open" world they were trying to create to actually "live the dream".

So if you just want to shoot some hoops with a friend this is a nice sports game. However, if you care at all about the game delivering on its promises in any actual game mode besides quick matches, you'll be disappointed.\n\nStreet - Sure, as long as you don't mind just walking around watching other people playing. You won't actually get to play any games, since as soon as you queue up, everyone else will leave, because they don't want to play with your low ranked scrub. If someone actually takes pity on you, get ready for the bashing of your life, seeing as your skills are probably mid stat and everyone else is maxed out. So time to open your wallet, pay good money and max out your character, wait another 20 minutes to even get into a game, lose anyway since everyone else also bought game potions.\n\nProAm - I still haven't figured out how this works. As far as I can see it has the same tedious problems as Street - this is just a 5 man version.You character will still suck. And you'll have to wait 30 minutes or so to fill up all slots to get the game going. 2K advertises this as a game mode where you can create your own team where there is an actual ranking, but to my knowledge you won't get anywhere near actually playing as your custom team unless you bring 4 friends.\n\nCareer - The "Spike Lee joint" part is ridiculous. 2K tries to feed you a storyline and crams in all kinds of characters that are supposed to add immersion. It does just the opposite. I have no idea why my white 5'8 geek was raised in an african-american family in Brooklyn. Nor why he speaks with the deep voice of a 7' giant. I mean, I get cut scenes where my stepmom (well, you explain it!) explains how she met my stepdad... and this is supposed to immerse me how exactly?\nHow you perform in high school makes no difference. What college you choose makes no difference. How you perform during your rookie season makes no difference.\n\nThen onto your first real season playthrough. And chances are big you'll finish dead last in your conference. Make a trade, the sooner the better. For me, I still thought my team had a fighting chance of making the playoffs, so I stayed on until it was too late. Then came the last season game and after that - Boom! Next season. I didn't get to see how the playoffs went, no awards, no summary, nothing. Oh well, atleast I can request a trade now? Nope! You need to play 10 games the next season first. Oh, so is that like an NBA rule? I'll just sim through the first ten matches. No, no. You actually have to play 10 matches. The fu....? So I'm stuck on this roster for ten more games? I'll just sim through the rest of the season, maybe some other team will take an interest in me. Not going to happen, silly... Now you're back at the start of a new season on the same crappy roster. Only now, your popularity on the trade boards have gone from 100% to 10-15%.\n\nMyTeam - *Uninstalls game...*\n\n","May 23","false","126.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Each player also has their own way of playing. Also body animations are added such as flexing playing with their mouth guard, dunk face animations, gum chewing, etc.\n\nThe rating system makes more sense this year even though some of you may disagree they are doing it by comparing the players ability to the greatest in that area like for example the best avg rebounder is Dennis Rodman so he has a 99 OFF and 95 DEF in rebounding compared to a current dominating rebounder with DeAndre Jordan who is given a 92 OFF and 94 DEF and same goes for other attributes so if you dont like it, no one cares.\n\nMyCareer also has the Spike Lee storyline which has lots of mixed feelings. I just want to mention in my opinions stop b*tching just cause yoour family is black, there are countless games that I've played where I'm given a family that looks nothing like me as a created player and like many others we dont complain we just play and enjoy what they give us. Also they'd need more voice actors which would be too expensive for something they're just trying out.\nAny way in MyCareer you now have offdays where you get to do either connections (haging out with someone in the leauge such as player, teamowner, celeb) where you get rewards like VC or my favourite you get to pick your game day jersey. Also there's training on off-days for attribute boosts and Endorsments that also give VC. So those are all your choice. Only problem I have with it is you play 3 HS games and 4 College no VC games but are fun and only 8 rookie season games while I would prefer having the whole rookie season to play.\n\nMyGm has been redesigned and is more realistic with team relocation added.\n\nMy Team added several new things like player cards that attributes change as the season goes by with their performance.\n\nI may missed some stuff but if this hasn't made you want the game, I don't know what will.\n\nSo if you want the best NBA... No, a sports game of all time. Here it is.\nWell till 2K releases something better anyway.","October 6, 2015","true","537.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

It's irrelevant how poorly you play, you are a superstar and that's it. Still, the actors are seemingly giving this annual release of a sports game their all and that makes the lengthy cutscenes in between games worth checking out.

You have no saying in the story whatsoever and regardless of how you play the game, the outcome will always be the same and you can't make any important choices. The story doesn't really make sense (seeing as you can be a white guy who has a black twin sister) but that's not a dealbreaker, guess they just didn't think it through.\nAlso, you can't have any real progression during high school, college and your rookie year, all you can do is follow the story without any of the mycareer (gameplay) mechanics, the real mycareer mode starts AFTER the story is finished, in your second year, but that's not really what alot of us want.\n\nAfter the story, mycareer is solid and a lot of fun, the gameplay is good, teammates aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the rating system is actually fair imo. Player progress doesn't go too fast or too slow and there's a lot of customisation going on, which is always fun.\nThe game mode is still not without it's annoyances though:\n- You can't change the sim quarter length (meaning that the cpu games will always last 48 mins, and if you want to be able to match up to other players/teams statwise you will need to play those minutes as well), i think this is a big miss.\n- Another annoyance is the fact that, if you sim your game, you sim the offdays. I for one enjoy organising and thinking on how i'll spend my offdays, be it doing connections, endorsements, or training. I do not intend to play 82 games every season, i like to sim about 30 of them i suppose. Simming these games will also sim your offdays, meaning you can't do anything on these days. Being able to sim day by day would make more sense.\n\nTLDR:\nOverall the game is fun, gameplay is great, online has it's flaws, spike lee ♥♥♥♥ed up.\n\nI'd recommend the game to any basketball fan, however, i can't help but feel that 2k could have done a MUCH MUCH MUCH better job.","September 29, 2015","true","21.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I don't think it's bad due to the 'ghetto hood rat' type of story, but it is just not good. No character development, and I don't understand where it's going. It almost feels downgraded compared to 2K15.\n\nGameplay - 8/10\nThe gameplay is pretty good, and is a lot more fast paced than 2K15. However, the camera is utter ♥♥♥♥ in this interation of the series, and that makes me hate it. Although, you still have basketball at it's core and that's all that matters to some people.\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nThe graphics are pretty damn amazing. Not lifelike at all, but they feel immersive. That said, getting the game to run without any frame drops is impossible. My GPU is a 660, but I've turned everything to low and even the crowd off and I get around the same frames as I do with everything on ~high.\n\nMultiplayer - 0/10\nHave fun trying to get this to work.

I've sent them around 10 refund requests, but to no avail. Steam obviously don't care about their customers, or they would have realised that this game is broken in a lot of places and therefore I have a vaild reason to get a refund.

I play on Superstar difficulty. You should bear that in mind when I review gameplay mechanics.\n\nGRAHICS: 8/10 It's more centered towards consoles, of course. It's still good. My mom once passed me playing & asked "Are you watching March of Madness?" Should give you an idea.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 9/10 The most important part of a basketball game is, of course, the basketball. & no one should be disappointed in this aspect. Even though this game is obviously more geared towards console users, the game is still miles better than previous titles in punishing the user for not having basketball simple IQ. You're going to hear a lot of people say that 2k15 was better. & I'll be honest it's easier to beast mode on Hall of Fame. But that's simply because you can cheese too much. Why I rate This game so high is because of its attempt to limit cheesing from previous titles & keep/improve upon the incorperation of real basketball concepts.\n\nShot Selection Importants:  Early after the games release you had players like Steph Curry missing 3 pointers taken early in transition, & unexplicably you still have players now with high 3 point accuracy missing open shots sometimes. The updates have fixed this a little, but I like where their heads where at. Because even though we have amazing 3 point shooters in the league, being a championship team is not about taking good shots, but passing up good shots for great ones. & more importantly the rhythm you're in when you take your shot is hugely important. The game will punish you if you aren't smart with the ball.\n\nKnowing when a player is on a hot night & when he's cold is hugely important. & It mostly depends on his physical state & morale. If your player in MyCarrer has been on the practice court after back to back games & tomorrow he's got another match you can bet he's going to be tired as balls & miss a lot of his easy shots. If you're unfamiliar with 2k they still do a great job of programming the AI to play like the real team would. You can bet that the Clippers are going to punish you with a ally-oop if you leave a lane open. Golden State will punish you from 3 if you're not physical on Defense.\n\nSpeaking of Defense this is where I have to commend this game. In 2k15 the defense was too easy to press the boost trigger & run around defenders. You could just cut & boost around the Defense going to the hole way to easily. In this title you have to EARN ALL YOUR POINTS. You have to know how to break ancles, having the wallet to increase your stats aren't enough. You actually have to know how to play the game of basketball. When to create isolation shots for you & your teamates, how to do that on and off the ball, etc. This game has vastly improved the Defense. They won't let you get past them by just hitting the boost button.\n\nMYCAREER 7/10: Let's address what's on everyones mind: Spike Lee Joint. Now I'm going to say it up front. This title has made me make a new rule about anything I play. "If at any point the story brings you to tears, you cannot rate it below 7/10. No matter how many hours the story is." I don't want to spoil anything folks, but there's a reason this game has the Story Rich tag. Spike Lee once again releases a controversal story which, in my opinion, tries to show you the life of what it's ACTUALLY like for most NBA players. It's not all shoe deals & fame but you still have a past. You still have friends from your past. The most important element of NBA life I think this story potrays is you will have friends & family leach off of your & it's how you respond to your situation that determines your success in the NBA. The positives of this story far outweigh the negatives, in my opinion. Then again I care more about basketball than the story.\n\nNow we stll have to talk about the negatives. Your family is inevitably black. No matter how you swing it. This normally wouldn't be a problem for someone if you aren't racist, cause adoption, but the story makes reference about your sister being a biological twin. So it kind of ruins the immersion if your character isn't black. Which is why I think this title is different because it's not supposed to be you, but Freq. Why people are mad at this is because in times past you were able to be yourself & there would be relatively no story but you would sign shoe deals & be a megastar. I've tried to find a million different ways to say this but this game doesn't necessarily want your face on the story, but instead Freq's. It's the difference between role-playing a defined character or a silent protagonist in my opinion. A preference thing. But you can't doubt that the story is immersive once you get over yourself. I'd personally like to see more of this from 2k but extend towards other ethnic groups. Maybe even do a 2k story about the difficulties the first woman player might face in the NBA.\n\nMYTEAM ?/10: Please refer to another review for this. It's not my cup of tea cause I'm not into that fantasy ♥♥♥♥ but from everything I've heard & all the gameplay I've seen on youtube it looks... Nice? One thing I'll say is that you can get beat out by people with deep pockets if you don't know the game of basketball, as is the same with all of your online expliots.\n\nMYCOURT 3/10: Do not get me started. It's dead. Liek, so ded. Granted I've played a few matches but nothing like on console. Mostly the 1v1v1 player match & 4-5 3 on 3 matches. You have to get with a friend & do some magic voodo ♥♥♥♥ in order to find a server with people on it. If you're buying this game to put in a ton of online hours don't. Just don't, not on PC. I personally don't think 2k is going to be a company that gears its products to PC users. Online aspects are total crap.\n\nPRO-AM 2/10: Take my review with a grain of salk cause I have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ENTER A MATCH. Never. I'm certain that like 10-15 of my hours can be attributed to waiting in an online lobby of some kind. I'm going to warn you with bold letters so you can't blame this review. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY THIS GAME FOR ONLINE STUFF YOU MUST HAVE FRIENDS. Like, as many as possible. Don't rely on people you meet in game either. You might get a few sessions in if you're lucky but you need RL friends with Steam & you need to go on Reddit to find people to play with. I tried for a little but it was just too tedious for me.\n\nMyGM 8/10: I think they nailed this, not much else to be said really. If you enjoy management of a basketball team & building a team based on your preferences with real basketball concepts this is your mode. Combine that with the improved gameplay from the last game & this is a great mode. You can choose to buy out the team you're managing, which is nice. You can of course manage prices of your seats, merchandice, & concession stands. You can relocate your team. Options are almost endless. My personal fav is having different personalities for your different Team owners. They've all got their own way of running a franchise whether it be focused more on winning at all costs, or making sure the team is in the black every fiscal year. & your owners vary in their patience & involvment in your decisions. Player minutes on the court, price of stuff, focusing on Draft picks or aquiring talent in the off-season, sometimes they'll defer to your judgement, & sometimes they won't take no for an answer & that all depends on how long of a lesh they give you.\n\nTLDR: You have to know your ♥♥♥♥ if you're going to play this years 2k cause less cheesing. MyCarrer is different from past titles, but a great story. Online sux balls, but were already in playoffs so that shouldn't really matter. MyGM is as stable & reliable as shes ever been. Not much has changed & what has changed is for the better IMO. If you're a basketball pureist who is okay with next gen console graphics this is for you.","May 25","true","184.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Last sports game I buy day one until Madden or some sort of REAL football comes to PC. IDK how many hours I have put into 2k as a game company (not just b-ball) but it's a lot I will spare you the details, sufficed to say I feel they could do better.\n\nStep 1. Go to ♥♥♥ .com and purchase the game for much cheaper than retial...\nStep 2. Regret purchase and uninstall\nStep 3. Write this review detailing the steps I took to get here\n\nSeriously though, the game is fun to an extent. Someone else said after the first myplayer, it's a grind well I say it is ALL A GRIND. The VC is more scarce and harder to get. They added more VC accomplishments but than they don't unlock. My character gets stuck in weird animations all the time. I can't skip cutscenes. IDK how many times I pressed start to skip a scene only to have it accidently take me to the park...\n\nThe park... Dear God the park\n\nSo the top guy shown on the loading screen is obviously a cheater. So is the second, thrid and fourth on down the line all 99 across the board. Some ppl are 7 ft tall and have the speed of I.T. (Boston Celtics P.G. now) and the quicks of A.I. mixed with the passing of J-will and Nash combined with the strength of Shaq in H.S. and Ben Wallace in his prime. Put all that mixed with the hops of that one nukka who pulled the 720 dunk on And One back in like '04 and you have a bunch of ultimate players that hardly pass the ball but know how to Kobe it up.\n\nYou ever see that meme on FB where Kobe is sitting at the table and someone asks him to PASS the salt and he has that perplexed look like "WTF nukka pass?" That's EVERYONE in the park from day one because they are all the greatest players in a TEAM sport. 2v2 is a joke. 3v3 is fun but only until the mascot comes around skateboarding with Allen Iverson next to him. Or the topless CHICK. To be clear, you CANNOT be a Female character in this game UNLESS you cheat.\n\nThey supposedly fixed the fact that noone could join anyone else's homecourt ever. My court was pretty cool looking. They did add some nice features but again it's a pain. The controls are different this year again... The story is just plain not needed. The always online mycareer is stupid and has been since day one. The reason I play mycareer is to play BY MYSELF in MY CAREER. I don't want it to be online if I did I would play it in online mode. That's why Madden has franchis online and offline OPTIONS. Madden doesn't force me to play my game online if I don't want to.\n\nAll that to say this: I got banned a while back for apprently exploiting the same thing that A LOT of ppl did and that's fine the servers will be off in a year or so anyways. NBD. My issue is that there was NO WARNING. That's all I will say on that.\n\nI do reccomend this game especially right this moment as it's just 20 dollars. I do not recommend this game if you want to play my career, my park, my team or street. I recommend this game as a time killer. When you are waiting for your kids to get home from school, play this. When you got something to do but it's just 40 mins away, play this.\n\nJUST SO YOU KNOW: YOU CAN NO LONGER PLAY PART OF A GAME AND THAN SAVE AND EXIT AND COME BACK TO IT IN MYCAREER. Apparently the best way to stop people from exploiting minute bugs like the save and quit VC glitch is to take out one of the best parts of the game.\n\nI didn't cover everything because I don't want to bore you.....","June 3","true","77.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Now im not the best gamer for NBA; however this game is clunky with or without the ball. With some practice it will get better but thats not what pushed me over the edge. What my problem with this game is, is that when you create a character you are automatically a black highschooler from the ghetto in New York. Why can't i be white? This is saying to me that you cannot be white to play in the NBA, which isnt true, but also it tells me that the majority of their audience is black. This to me is racist.

My carareer is basically the same as last year but they magaged to make it more trash by adding in Spike Lee. Seriously, the story touches on subjects and situations that has no business in a game like this. We just want to enjoy the game of basketball, not open up a debate about various social issues. just for clarity, im black and im very familar with his work. And 90% of it is stereotypical trash, why 2K thought it was a good idea to bring him on is beyond me. so basically, my career is a wash. O, and hackers....everywhere.\n\nwell, enough of that\n\nThe game really shines on the court.  Passing, post play, screens all butter smooth. The AI reacts "intelligently" to what you are doing on the court and your line up. If you got lebron or curry dropping 30 in the third they do alot more than just double team them when they touch the ball. Theyll, play screens differently, deny the ball, force you to take long 2's. Its really actually pretty good. A clear improvement in graphics and animations as well. And the soundtrack is back to form as well.\n\nThat being said, literally everything else either didnt change or got worse.  Ill have to recomend becasue steam lacks a damn middle ground.\n\nTL:DR\nMy career: Spike Lee/10 hes an idiot\n\nOnline:       Hackers/10 (and lag)\n\nMy GM:       7/10 not much changed, wasnt expecting it to.\n\ngameplay:    9/10 best in series\n\nAudio:           New Buggatti/10 would engrage people in my apartment again.\n\noverall: 6/10  if you just want to play some good offline basketball look no further.

While that is true for the most part, there have been more improvements than I expected, particularly with the gameplay itself.\n\nSmoother animations, better dunk animations, better rebounding, and a better-than-expected MyCareer mode are some of the things I definitely like so far.\n\nHowever, it does not have the best optimisation for PC - while mine runs just fine (i5-6600K, R9 390, 8gb RAM, 1440p) but a lot of people are having trouble with framerate drops and poor performance overall. The controls have been changed yet again, which would take some getting used to (though it does feel better than with 2K15).\n\nOverall, I am quite satisfied with this iteration of the series, but it's definitely not for everyone. There's still a lot more to improve in this game, but with yearly releases, I can't really complain too much.","September 25, 2015","true","497.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I love the changes to MyGM and MyLeague, which is the only reason I'm recommending this game. However, if you are intending to make MyCareer the majority of your playing experience...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game is advertised as 'My Story' yet puts you on a linear preplanned story. If it was my story my guy would not have been born in Harlem, he would have attended a different college program, and he would have stayed for more than one year. Spike Lee directing the story ruins whatever immersion I had with the character.\n\nI feel MyCareer has some good moments and ideas. I love the idea of playing high school ball and choosing a college. Yeah there are only 9 choices and I wish there were more, but I understand why with the cost of getting more on board so I don't let that bother me.\n\nWhat MyCareer did wrong. Only able to spend one year in college; I get it you are supposed to be a superstar but let us decide if we want to stay one more year. Heck make the games challenging enough that we don't win the NCAA tournament giving us the option to stay and try again out of pride. Your skill rating when you join the NBA is a puny 55. This forces you to either play with a crappy player, buy VC with your money, or farm in other modes first. On top of that they kept the grouped together stat increases that NBA 2k15 started, which reduces the variation of play styles I could develop MY player into.\n\nI haven't finished up to the FA period yet, so I can't comment on length of seasons fairly. I do like shorter seasons compared to the older games when you had to play every game, but I don't like them moving away from 2k15's decision to let you pick which games you play.\n\nOverall, if you are looking at this game for the MyPlayer mode...just stick to 2k15 or 2k14 and just watch the cutscenes on YouTube. If you are looking at the MyGM/MyLeague then I say buy it, the improvements are worth it.","September 28, 2015","true","102.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

With that said, a lot of negative reviews here are from the fps/stutter issues and terrible keyboard support. On default video settings, I also experienced fps drops and stutters during gameplay with a 980 and i7 4790k. However, after switching from Fullscreen mode to Windowed Fullscreen in the video options, all my fps and stutter issues were gone. I'd suggest a lot of people to try that if they are having problems and avoid using a keyboard for now. As far as crashes go, I haven't experienced any at all.\n\nPros:\n-Improved MyCareer\n-Improved MyGM and MyLeague\n-Improved gameplay over 2K15\n-Incredible depth in MyLeague\n-Animations are way better\n-Defense is actually challenging and rewarding\n-Very smooth gameplay after stutters were fixed\n\n\nCons:\n-Bug with Fullscreen mode plagued with fps and stutter issues\n-Bad keyboard support\n\n\nI'd highly recommend this if you are a fan of 2K15, as 2K16 is a massive improvement over it.","September 26, 2015","true","198.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

You go through most of the negative reviews and they center on one of the following:\n\n1)  The Mycareer mode isnt great - which is subjective.\n\nYou shouldnt thumbs down an entire game on a mode that lasts only 8 or so games.  Once you get out of the Spike Lee Joint it goes back to what you know and love back in 2k15 for example.\n\n2)  The game has tech problems / my computer is too butthurt to run this game.\n\nThis is again subjective.  I honestly dont have a great system, R9 270x, 16gb of ram (game with Dell rig) and a I7 3.60 gig processor among other things.  Bottom line if you dont have those specs dont play this game - if you ran 2k15 fine, you'll be more than fine with this one.\n\n3)  The game doesnt support keyboard controls or the keyboard controls are poop.\n\nAre you serious?  This is not only 2015 but a sports game, a console game, a game that I would figure is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to play without an analogue controller.  Its like trying to play a flightsim without a joystick, or even at least a controller.  There are certain genres that suit certain control methods and keyboard isnt one for sports games - or anything that operate in a 3D playing field.  Back in the day when you only moved left and right or up and down sure, but again this is 2015.\n\nSo again overage this game is top notch, I played 2k15 to death at almost 70 hours and I got it when the season was almost over.  I got the game now before the start of the season and I am already almost at 18 hours.\n\nOnly valid complaint i would say is that its not newbie friendly, the computer AI will CRUSH you if you dont know how to basketball and it doesnt do a good enough job of "teaching" you how to play or why you should do certain things.  So brush up on your basketball IQ before hand or be ready to lose a lot of games.\n\nWELL WORTH THE PURCHASE 5/5","October 9, 2015","true","131.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

The off-season is one of my favorite parts.  Also you can relocate as many teams as you want in MyLeauge.

I was so hyped for this mode but Spike Lee's involvement puts so many limitations on what the MyCareer should of really been, at least for your high scool, college, and rookie season... It was rushed and felt like I had no control over my player's decisions other then selecting which college I wanted to play for.  Anyways after your rookie season is over the actual mode is unlocked and just like the previous year it's the same with some slightly new additions.

It's more fluid, it has better graphics, it has more customization, it has more everything.  Some new features are executed very well and really add something new to the game.  It feels like a better game from day 1.  I've been interested enough to play 17 hours in 3 days, and more importantly, I've had new things to do in 17 hours.  All the negative reviews are filled with people with more hours than me, like, come on.\n\nBut... the negative reviews are pretty justifiable.  2k has somehow forgotten the preorder bonuses and have done nothing about the hackers.  Every myPark game you go to, you will find a hacker.  Hacks include:\n-99 overall hack\n-Park cards hack\n-Badges hack\n-Skin hack\n-Bodymod hack\nAnd it also doesn't help that the PC version is terribly optimised and the myCareer seems like some half ♥♥♥♥♥ third party movie.  There is absolutely no freedom of choice in the myCareer.  It's completely possible they'll add a patch upgrading the story, fixing the optomisation, but at this stage of the game, don't get your hopes up.  I'm not really playing myCareer right now because they will presumably wipe your progress.\n\nYes, you should buy this game if you're an avid basketball fan.  Even if this game sucked, I'd still buy it.  And dont think live 16 is that much better than 2k16.

However, we've already had two patches and it seems that this year the developers are actually caring a bit more!\n\nOverall:\n- if you're a basketball fan(atic) and an avid gamer, then you already have this game\n- if you're looking at a high price and wondering if it's worth it, the answer is yes - just look for a discount somewhere and you will find it\n- if you want to know why there are more cons than pros up top, read on - this game is really good, but has a few annoying things that really shouldn't have been like this\n\nThanks, Spike Lee. You've managed to write the story for MyCareer mode that wouldn't get a 3 on IMDb if it was a movie. What did I expect? A branching and immersive story. What did I get? My career starts in 2016/2017. No relation to real world anymore. Trades going on. MVPs happen. And I missed all of that.\n\nAs you could have guessed, this is the game mode I play most. When this awful part of the game ends (the story), the game really becomes something much better. Many improvements have been made. Many opportunities have been missed, too, but you can't expect every single item on your wishlist to come true.\n\nThe game is really challenging (on Hall of Fame level) and sometimes brutally unforgiving (your teammates just can't sink a shot or defend anyone sometimes, even if you're on fire on both ends of the floor), but I would say that it is a feature, not a bug.\n\nOnline experience has been somewhat improved regarding MyPark from the last iteration, and I haven't really played much of other game modes.","November 9, 2015","true","266.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I've played 2k15 and some of the older NBA live games over the years. I bought 2k16 because I wanted an updated version of 2k15.\n\nOverall it seems like people want to complain about the MyCareer mode. I don't understand what everyones complaints are. Yea it is a little odd I made a white guy with a black twin sister. But I found it more funny haha than annoying. In fact, I found 2k15 to be worse since it was almost impossible to make a white guy that didn't have black features and to top it all off they forced your voice to be black as well. So in reality why didn't people complain about that in 2k15? Cause it didn't matter, just like this doesn't matter.\n\nIgnore the peopel who think the MyCareer mode is only about this story. The story is actually a very SHORT part of MyCareer mode. It only last around 15 games. You do Highschoo, then College, then your Rookie year. After that, it doesn't matter where you got drafted, where you went to school, or what your nickname is. You can change ALL of those settings after the rookie year. Think of the story as a cool intro to the mode and also 15 games to learn the controls without having any negative impact on your character. It doesn't matter how bad you play at all in those games, you will get the same result.\n\nAs for the game overall I give it a 8/10. It does basketball well. The passing is improved from last year. I don't have my guy dropping passes into the other teams middle when trying to pass behind me. The control stick seems more responsive on changes to dunks and layups. The graphics are hot. I play on everything maxed, with 100fps all the time, and can see the sweat coming off the guys perfectly. Best of all, I can use my DS4 controller, without DS4tools, and keep the xbox icons. Last year, it defaulted to 1,2,3,4 buttons instead of the icons, making it hard to know which button was what.\n\nIf you liked 2k15, get this. It's improved and fun.

The game itself is clearly poorly optimized even for me and I have gtx 980's in SLI. Furthermore the story will only make sense if you want to play as a black person (which is fine if you do) I made a white character with red hair only to be injected into a story where my family is black(and don't seem to realize i'm white), I live in the "hood" and my voice actor is noticibly black. Obviously that is contextually nonsensical and I ultimately went back to change my character to a black person so as not to mess with immersion. After that mess I tried to play in my first high school game (still no tutorial, although in the open gym you are supposed to mess around in before your high school game might have had some ques, the control mechanism to pick up the ball didn't even work so while messing around TRYING TO PICK UP A BALL I accidentally started the HS game). After seeing that I could do nothing other than run in circles I quit and looked for tutorials and control schemes only to find that ALL OF THEM ARE FOR CONSOLE CONTROLLERS, EVEN THE VOICE ACTED TUTORIALS ONLY TALK ABOUT CONSOLE CONTROLLERS. This is absolutely rediculous.\n\nlet me be clear I am not an inexperienced pc gamer by any means. This being on steam is nothing but a poorly thought out cash grab.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Want to feel uncomfortable while listening forced, vague, and crappy dialogue? Want to watch two hours of cut scenes that follow a plot so forced that you could swear it was a Spike Lee film? Want your 55 rated, 9th overall pick be told how amazing he is by everyone while he pulls 6 minutes a game? Well prepare yourself for 15 cut scenes, filled with the same message being told over, and over, and over, for the longest needlessly dragged out "movie" in history!\n\nI played 450 hours in 2K15, and nearly all of that time was put into playing career mode. This year, I've played it for maybe 4 hours. I was so excited for this years career mode. There are fun elements to it, don't get me wrong. I love playing in college, and I love that this isn't the same old "Nobody to GOAT" cliche that has been pushed in career mode the last few years. Still, the most hyped part of this game for me isn't really all that it was cracked out to be, and I'm not really sure how many more horrifically uncomfortable cut scenes I have to watch.\n\nMyTeam is pretty much the only thing I've put a lot of time into. i like the improvements to the packs this year, as the awful packs last year took away pretty much my favorite game mode. The challenges are fun. Domination is fun. The Gauntlet is addicting and an amazing addition. My court and jerseys are awesome. The only problem with MyTeam is that playing online has been impossible. I either haven't been able to find a game, or th servers crash mid game. When the servers crash, they give you a "0-0" loss on your record (that's a tie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, not a loss), and they still keep the contracts you spent on the game. So I used up about 7 contract games on my players before getting smart and just giving up with Road to the Playoffs for the time being. General server frustrations aside, MyTeam is worth the buy.\n\nIn general, gameplay this year is good. That being said, it's much harder. Last year, I played the computer mostly on Hall of Fame, while this year, All-Star is a close game, and sometimes even pro can be a bit of a challenege, especially in MyTeam. I rarely shoot threes anyways, but this year I've had to nearly cut them all together. Players like Klay Thompson and Eric Gordon will miss tons of absolutely wide open, catch and shoot 3 pointers. Jump shots in general seem a bit off, and if there's a hand in your face, for get about it.\n\nDefensive optimization isn't great so far. Often times the my center (controlled by the computer) will jump out of the way of an incoming player, only to jump back and foul him, almost as if its a built in animation. Also switching players with the 'A' button almost always goes to the wrong guy (this is true with passing using the 'A' button). Also right bumper doesn't always work, so often I try to quickly RB+X to pass to my center forward on the fast break, and I end up taking a 3/4 court shot. That's happened a lot.\n\nThere's a lot to like about the game, and it's very addictive and fun. I'd recommend it to anyone. There may be lots of problems now, but 2K eventually patches a lot of the really annoying in game mistakes (like the RB+X).","October 12, 2015","true","233.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

From shooting to general movement, the game feels really smooth. I haven't experienced any crashes yet. I am running this on 1440p with a GTX 980.\n\nMy only quirk is that MyCareer has a little too much story. I like that fact that I can play in high school and all of that, but sometimes the cut scenes are way too long and not engaging at all. It all goes away after the first season though,, but then it feels completely empty because there are rarely anymore cut scenes.\n\nAlso MyPark is basically dead during the day, but is packed during the night time. I do see a lot of the same people around so I hope the online community stays alive, but I wouldn't be surprised if everyone stops playing. I would say that the console ports have a bigger and wider community. I would blame it on the PC optimization of this game.\n\nGreat game overall.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/veckthenoob/recommended/370240/","veckthenoob","Veck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/veckthenoob/","19 products in account","Perspective: I'm a fan of the NBA 2K series for some time now, I have played every single game since 2K11 extensively and I have played NBA 2K16 for close to 150 hours at the time of this review.\n\nShort and sweet:\nNBA 2K16 is the best sports simulation game I have played to date. Unlike franchises like FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer, 2K constantly reinvents it's game on a yearly basis rather than release the same product just with updated rosters every year.\nThis year's title is a big step forward from the last one and it manages to do a lot of things right, particularly now after a few patches.\nIf you're a basketball fan or even if you're just looking for a fun sports game to play casually, I would fully recommend you pick up this game even at full price.\n\nLong and nitpicky:\nThe game's launch was not without it's issues, from gameplay tweaks that were made through patches and performance issues on PC... It was not a complete disaster but far from a perfect launch, from the inability for keyboard users to edit keybinds to graphic settings rendering the game unplayable it took some doing to get a great experience out of it at launch. As of the time of this review, most of these issues have been addressed though a little history never hurts anyone looking to make an informed purchase.\n\nPositives:\nThe game boasts fairly good visuals and don't even get me started on the gameplay... It is by far the best basketball simulation game I have ever played, actually make that the best sports simulation game!\n\nRelatively low requirements on the hardware front make it accessible to a wide range of consumers which is always good though I'd recommend at least meeting the recommended requirements for a complete visual experience.\nFor comparison's sake, I run the game on a GTX 970 (non-OC) and an i5 4690k (OC to 4,2 Ghz) with every possible filter injected (8x Supersample + 8x MFAA + FXAA) via Nvidia control panel and it runs silky smooth at 60 FPS at a 1080p resolution without GPU usage ever going above around 80% so we're dealing with a decent port here.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, most of the cheese tactics from previous years have been nullified in this year's game. Want to drive baseline and get a bucket everytime? Better boot up 2K15 then because it's not happening in 2K16.\nExcellent AI defense makes it a challenge to score every trip down the floor, mindless attempts to get to the basket will most likely result in blocked shots than in points, attempting to thread the needle through defenders will probably end up in a turnover... These are but a few examples of how AI has been improved this year.\n\nMost game modes are back and better than before, such as myGM and myTEAM. Up-to-date rosters, new and better animations and all other goodies that one might expect are also a part of the package.\n\n\nNegatives:\nThe myCAREER mode was highly hyped as a Spike Lee directed story and I'm afraid it was arguably this game's greatest letdown. You follow your player's career since high school, into college and eventually into the NBA although in some key points along the ride you're faced with decisions which are presented to you but you really have no deciding power over what happens next. You're only able to play 8 games during your rookie year in the league (9 if your team makes the playoffs) the rest will be automatically simulated. This game mode opens up once you reach your sophomore year in the league however and from there the experience is excellent.\n\nThe typical flavor of the month builds for myPLAYERs still exist after every patch, if you're looking to play myPARK or other online modes extensively this information might be of value to you.\nAlso there are some latency issues for non-NA players, I personally can't make a jumper online because of this.\n\nmyTEAM mode gets content updates regularly, but not regularly enough and most of the content it gets is irrelevant. This mode along with myPARK are the modes I'd classify as the 2 main attractions of the game when it comes to online play so I definitely see this as a negative. Most new packs contain only 1 or 2 relevant new cards and the rest will literally never see the light of day and have no use aside from contributing towards collection rewards.\n\n\nSumming up:\nNBA 2K16 is a solid 9/10 if I was asked to resort to that rating system.\nIt's not a perfect game, but the issues it has have not dragged down the experience for me. The revamped gameplay and gorgeous visuals keep me coming back for more.\nThe game is well worth it's full price and a complete must-have for any basketball simulation fan.","December 30, 2015","true","193.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Though the gameplay is fun most of the time, the has bugs and glitches which carry on from year to year.\n\nSavefiles can get corrupted and become unloadable. Which means your spent VC are lost! This can happen to MyCareer and to MyGM (ever bought the team for 50k VC and some seasons later you can't load the save anymore? Very nice...)\nThe game is balanced too much around the VC and onlinegameplay. Because of issues with MyPark during the last years, where 7 footers could hit 3s and run as quick as small point guard, they changed the skill system (again! and again for the worse). No my center is lame as a duck and can never be as quick as f.e. Dwight Howard. And you can't be the new Nowitzki or Jordan because the harsh way your skills are bound to your height is ridicoulus. I don't like the upgrading of skills in fixed categories either. Want to raise your midrange game? Well, then you have to raise 3s, fts as well. The old system, where you could just raise the one skill you wanted is gone since last year.\n\nIngame the AI is often stuck and players will just hold on to the ball and do nothing until the shotclock is down to 2, then they will shoot a contested fadeaway 3...\n\nThe new MyCareer story is a nice idea but failed hard. The story is outright racist, because there is just one family option. Want to be a white guy, or asian, or indian? Well, see how your twin and the whole family are afroamericans. They could have easily changed the story to say you have been adopted as a child and it would be fine! Then the story is always the same, just the teams you play for change. In your rookie season, you can play only 8 games and have absolutely no clue what's going on in the nba because you can't see any rankings, stats, etc. Becoming ROY is almost impossible, because you won't be getting the minutes you need and the other rookies are starters and play very good. Even with 15ppg 10rpg  and 2bpg I wasn't ROY, because i only played 20min/pg.You can't use custom rosters on MyCareer too btw, so no editing the playes too their real values. You won't earn any VC during highschool or college and will start as a 55 overall in the nba, even if you manage to get picked top ten or even #1. Well, 2k wants you to buy VC ;-)\nThen your second season, after free agency(!) you can earn 17million $ a year and still come off the bench. That you go to free agency after season 1 is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and breaks the nba rules. You are no second rounder, come on 2k!\n\nBuy this only for 10€ or under in a sale.","November 4, 2015","false","108.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KodeNB/recommended/370240/","KodeNB","Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KodeNB/","206 products in account","Here is my thoughts on the game as of two main gamemodes as in the MyGM gamemode and the MyCareer Gamemode\n\n\nMyGM:\n\nI felt like the MyGM mode was fairly good and very refreshing for a gamemode that has been the same and kind of needed a new thing added to it. The team relocation is a great addition, but is very hard to do and you need to play for a long time to get enough salary to even have the oppurtunity to do the relocation. So if you have the time to do 4-5 seasons and be able to complete the goals then you will be fine. But if you only do anything below the 4-5 seasons then the MyGM mode is mainly the same with only a new layout and 3-team trades to go along with it.\n\nMyCareer:\n\nThey add highschool, college, and you get a story through the first year in the NBA. What could go wrong? That you play 15 games, 3 being 3 minute quarters, and then watch a movie for the rest of the time having no control when if it is really your life and options then you should be able to choose like you could in NBA 2K15. But this is really sad to see because they advertise it as a game where you can choose your story and life.......in reality you can't.\n\nNBA 2K15 - 7/10\n\nGet it on sale, not for full price.","December 28, 2015","true","108.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game to me isnt a whole lot different from 2k15, but the few changes were good. This game is a ton of fun, I dont see all the negative reviews.

The fact that I had to waste 2 days trying to get hold of a Xbox controller is frankly ridiculous as the keyboard controls in 2K16 are ♥♥♥♥. 2. Some glitches like commentary cutting out completely for like 10 minutes during each game are annoying. 3. I couldn't play on the Park without getting destroyed until I was at least 80 OVR. Cashers....\n\nHowever, 2K16 is still a very good game. Gameplay improved, new features on GM/League/Team are refreshing and fun. MyCareer is still the most indepth career mode in any sports game. But my biggest beef with the MyCareer is the rookie season, which Spike Lee seems to think is unimportant to us.","October 14, 2015","true","431.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It's more or less the same game as the before years, without some of the kinks and with a couple additional features.\nIt's really, really, really fun! I mostly played MyPlayer (the career mode) with two positions (PG and C) and this year it's better than ever, because the AI actually tries to set up plays and moves around the whole shotclock, whereas before they just stood around when the play fell apart.\nI didn't like the newest, most hyped, addition to the game which was Spike Lee's Story Mode in MyPlayer. Yeah it's fun to play in high school and college but it just sucks that you only play about 10 games your rookie year and the rest is simulated. Part of the fun for me was trying to win ROY award and play in All Star Games while my stats aren't that good. Another weird thing is (and I skiped most of the story) that you're released at the end of your first year, and sign a 10 million dollar contract in your 2nd year in the league, with pretty much any team you like.\n\nLong story short: Buy it, you won't be disappointed (even in MyPlayer once you finish the Spike Lee storyline)","December 27, 2015","true","226.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Aside those things, the game isn't terrible, in fact... really good:\n\n-Hopefully 2k can fix the above, because I love how the game flows from one animation to the other.\n\n-MyCareer is almost movie like *no pun intended*, I love how it's a story of a regular kid becoming a legend.\n\n-The Soundtrack has a mix of *2k* classics (old music they salvaged, which the fans still loved). Plus a lot of modern day artists, such as DJ Khaled, Drake, etc... I personally like the soundtrack since I listen to most of the music anyway, but that obviously depends from person to person.\n\n-2ktv... the lady is basically a model... HOW CAN YOU NOT STARE IN HER GREATNESS!\n\nCurrently, I see this game as a 7/10, could possible go up with future updates to MyCareer, and when I get around to using MyPark (screw the other game modes, IMO).","September 26, 2015","true","460.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

When I started the game after restart; it lagged like crazy. I couldn't move in the menu... took 10+ seconds to move down each mode. I tried many fixes; validating files, patching, downloading drivers, etc. Now I am going to reinstall the damn game... The story is good so far; I like the addition. The gameplay was fun, but now I can't do anything...\n\nPlease please please don't buy this till you know for sure that there is a patch.

I cant ******* play. 2K really needs to fix the controller responce when most PC players are playing with wired controllers but everytime i get in a game on court it's cause my Controller is completely nonresponcive and everytime i go in the menu using the keyboard It will still tell me the Xbox controls even tho i unpluged my controller and restarted the game with it pulled out. I wont beable to play games online and get stuff which for people reading this just to know about the game before getting it. Is most of what players do and i know alot of PC players that i have to tell them to wait cause the controllers wont responce when you get on a court but while walking around or in the menu it works fine. Also there are some story problems like the coachs. I been in so far 2 stories cause one wouldnt let me play at all but this second one the coach will take me out at the worse times like i got a "good foul" as the game told me but my coach will take me out the game and the next dude will miss the shots aswell if i make a 3 pointer it will do the same.

MyCareer, at least the story portion of it is awesome at first. You go from high school, to college to the NBA, after that it's one giant cluster of a mess of a story. I didn't really like it one bit. You get two choices in the story 1) What high school you're attending and 2) What college you're committing to. It was difficult to get immersed into a story that I didn't particularly care about and the story wasn't engaging at all, there is no input, no matter how poorly you play your rookie season, the story arc is exactly the same. Spike Lee? Please stay away from video games, your story telling is sub par.\n\nOther than that, the game itself is really good. The controls feel different and I think it's a good thing. The mechanics feel better and you can see the work they put in on the animations in the game.

Finally, this game is once again attempting to sell you a virtual currency as a method of making yet more money.

Im sorry i didn't pay $133.21 to work out what controllre button corresponds to a keyboard button. I have requested steam to provide me refund for this game.

Been playing these games for a long time. The graphics of this game are bananas! So good. My favorite part of these games is usually the MyCareer mode. Not the case with 2K16. This is a Spike Lee joint in the truest form. You're a black kid from Harlem, even if your player is white. You and your family grow up in the projects. I mean, OK. But then when you get drafted your team owner is apparently a rich white racist who makes fun of the way black poeple talk. Completely unnecessary. That's Spike for you though. Other than that, your player seems to forget how to shoot/walk once they get into the league and you start off as a 55 so the first few games are really enjoyable (sarcasm). Kyrie had my point guard on skates the whole game. I've been called for traveling on about half of my jump shots-which is due to the lag. I've played around with video settings and my nvidia control panel but we're just going to have to wait for a patch to fix the lag I believe. I'm not going to complain too much about the lag because it should be an easy fix and the game will be very good I think once everything is patched up. It will be worth the money, ya know, when it's playable.","September 26, 2015","true","118.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sometimes.\nYour MYPlayer actually looks like he could be based off of a real person and not some ♥♥♥♥ed up generic clone.\n\n\nCons:\nThe story in MYCareer mode is VERY CHEESY, not enough for me to dislike the game, but enough to be mentioned as a con.\nThough animations have been improved, there are a couple contact-shot animations near the basket that could use some work.\nHaven't received my bonus VC yet for the pre-order, I heard that I'll be able to get it when the game officially releases on the 29th. How come the console peasants get their Bonus now??? Yes, I'm salty.\n\n\n\nOVERALL- The game has improved substantially over the last few years, both in terms of animations and graphical detail. I'll give it a 9/10 and definitely would reccomend it to those of you who haven't yet pulled the trigger on it.","September 26, 2015","true","30.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS MY PROMISED PRE-ORDER BONUS?!"\n\n-Also, the games you get with HS, and college are meaningless. How am I supposed to improve my player during College when he has a 55 ovr... and not be able to spend points to increase his ability?! Since you're not getting any VC... you're pretty much only playing for the atmosphere and draft stock.\n\n-By the time you hit pro *since you can't use VC yet*, you'll be 55 ovr.\n\n-When you're in HS, you basically can't miss. In College, you have to play a little smarter... but in the pros?... you can't hit a pool from 5ft.\n\n-Not to mention... I would've liked the ability to play more than 4 college games? Speaking of that, you're mitigated to 8 games your first pro year. *real improvement* my ♥♥♥.\n\nAnyways, sick of bashing MyCareer. Aside those things, the game isn't terrible, in fact... really good:\n\n-Hopefully 2k can fix the above, because I love how the game flows from one animation to the other.\n\n-MyCareer is almost movie like *no pun intended*, I love how it's a story of a regular kid becoming a legend.\n\n-The Soundtrack has a mix of *2k* classics (old music they salvaged, which the fans still loved). Plus a lot of modern day artists, such as DJ Khaled, Drake, etc... I personally like the soundtrack since I listen to most of the music anyway, but that obviously depends from person to person.\n\n-2ktv... the lady is basically a model... HOW CAN YOU NOT STARE IN HER GREATNESS!\n\nCurrently, I see this game as a 7/10, could possible go up with future updates to MyCareer, and when I get around to using MyPark (screw the other game modes, IMO).","September 26, 2015","true","460.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The team relocation is a great addition, but is very hard to do and you need to play for a long time to get enough salary to even have the oppurtunity to do the relocation. So if you have the time to do 4-5 seasons and be able to complete the goals then you will be fine. But if you only do anything below the 4-5 seasons then the MyGM mode is mainly the same with only a new layout and 3-team trades to go along with it.\n\nMyCareer:\n\nThey add highschool, college, and you get a story through the first year in the NBA. What could go wrong? That you play 15 games, 3 being 3 minute quarters, and then watch a movie for the rest of the time having no control when if it is really your life and options then you should be able to choose like you could in NBA 2K15. But this is really sad to see because they advertise it as a game where you can choose your story and life.......in reality you can't.\n\nNBA 2K15 - 7/10\n\nGet it on sale, not for full price.","December 28, 2015","true","108.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics look great too, but graphics are not everything. And this game is very unstable, network-wise as the game forces you to play online if you want to see actual and meaningful progress for your MyCareer (it started last year; you can play offline with limited experience; BS).\n\nAnyway, server always crashes, and for one week, there would be atleast 2 me or my friend cannot connect through the network. This is disappointing as they release a huge patch which definitely improved the performance, but did not even fix some of the major problems like the commentator dropping out if you're playing with 6+ minute per quarter. Cannot play an online game with friend without us getting kicked off with no apparent reason, and many more.\n\nIf you will ever fix this game; please, fix it now or before the year ends.\n\nAnother thing is the MyCareer, I hate the first part of it. The story is unwanted, though I had wanted to start from HS to College and eventually to NBA, but you don't have to put some drama crap within it. You emphasize this game as my choice, but on the first part of the game mode, there is no choice whatsoever. Good thing I got passed it and finally enjoying a better MyCareer experience.\n\nDon't buy it full price. Buy it when it's 33% or 50% off atleast.\n\nEDIT AS OF 11/21/2015:\nYes, I will finally recommend this game to you guys. They finally fixed almost everything, finally, and finally. Though if you're not a hardcore fan, just wait for atleasst 33% off since the game may be really fun, but if you're looking for a total innovation, you won't really find it here, and MyCareer this year has been the cheesiest one so far (just the first year). If you can get this cheap, much better, if no, I must say it's now a decent game to play.","November 7, 2015","true","312.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Everyone I know over at the reddit.com/r/nba2k community agrees with me that the gameplay was made too difficult and that there are so many bugs in this game, this was by far the most sloppy release from 2k.\n\nI've been playing NBA2K for years and this feels like the most unrefined version of NBA2K ever, especially on the PC version. Rampant hackers, terrible story mode, gameplay was tweaked to be 'realistic' aka my gold and purple players can't make wide-open shots half the time.. Kevin Durant missing from 17' out on non-user mode is blasphemy.\n\nThis is extremely dissapointing because NBA2K was originally made to be better than NBA Live, now EA is going to take advantage of NBA2K's miscue because their game had a terrible director (Spike Lee). The entire storeline is forced and feels borderline racist, as NBA2K doesn't seem to realize how diverse their audience is.\n\nGo play NBA2K15, 2K games needs to fix this game and improve it. Their ticketing system looks like it's disabled because they're probably getting so many complaints.","October 8, 2015","false","73.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My first impressions were decent of this game. MyCareer is my favorite mode, and they managed to make it somewhat dissapointing. How? by pumping up your player to be the next Superstar, but making him worse than a d-league player. It takes some real hard work to earn VC, but the real pain is that they wave a lot of VC points in your face in exchange for money. That's the equivalent of waving a juicy steak in your face, while you are poor as dirt. You can take the steak and eat it on the spot, or work at a dead end job that pays you way less than minimum wage, but you will eventually have enough to buy that steak. Beware! fun to play but also frustrating like opening a jar of golden nuggets. Oh, and also lots of bugs. LOTS OF THEM.

I cant speak to the techinical problems that many others had regarding low frames in the menu and the like but as far as a basketball game this Is ROCK SOLID. The game is balanced extremely well and most of the exploits that you could use against AI have been fixed. I dont deal with people online so I cant speak to that experiance either, I just play offline and a lot of the MyGM and My Career modes. Speaking of my Career people are far to harsh on it. The first season is a write off as far as games/wins mattering and things like that but the story is pretty compelling and I find the acting and converstations far more believeable than anyhting 2K has written in the past. ONCE you get past the first year of your pro career (which consists of 8 games with story elements behind them) the game rolls into the traditional my career formula for the next years which is more or less the same as it was last year with one HUGE improvement.\n\nOff days now matter you have limited time  to get your star to being what you'd envisioned as far as endorsements,  skills, fans and everything else. For the first time in a 2k game your Star doenst feel Ignored or like he's on the back burner. what I mean by that is that the ingame personalities Reconize your Greatness, often have pre game converstaions about the crazy string of tripple doubles you've put up or your incredible shooting streak!. thats awesome! I even had one situation where at half time blake griffen was talking about how difficult it was to stop my Athletic gard for legimate reasons, not just generic "well hes really great player so hes difficult" its more taylord to what I do im a driving gaurd that shots a really high percentage from mid range so the converstaion was more about how difficult it is to gaurd me with the mid range shot. that is awesome I really feel like my player is the best player in the league and the league Reconizes it! that is a huge win in my opinion and has made me far more invested in my career.\n\nPreformance:\n\nfor me the game is rock solid. I play it at 1440p and get anywhere from 100-130fps durring gameplay with all settings on High (supersampling on 1).\n\nmy system is :\ni7-3770(non K)\nGTX 980TI\ngame is running off a 500GB Samsung 850 evo SSD.\n\nI recomend this game to anyone who really enjoyed last years game.

The two biggest issues being brought up are optimization, and Spike Lee’s “MyCareer” mode.\n\nFirst of all, if your computer meets the system requirements, you can run all gameplay at a very smooth FPS. I have all graphic settings maxed and can run the game perfectly fine. The stuttering and lag being described in the reviews has ONLY occurred for me during the between-gameplay cutscenes, (introductions, timeouts, ect). While actually in game, everything runs better than ever, with smooth animations and high definition characters. The graphics are by far more superior to any previous installment.\n\n2K decided to take a risk and use Spike Lee to write/direct the MyCareer mode. Like any other movie, Lee’s story centers around one character and his family. While you can make your character look any way you want, the story encourages you to be a young black man. If you don’t want to be black, you don’t have to be. It is not racist like some people say… it is just how the story is meant to be. Throughout 2K games, many people have hoped and wished that eventually they would have the choice to play through High School and College games. NBA 2K16 listened to its fans and delivered on this! Now everyone is complaining because it isn’t good enough… I on the other hand found that it complimented the story in a perfect amount of games (4 high school, 4 college). Between each game, the story progresses. The story itself is actually quite engaging! You feel emotion towards the characters IF you take the time to listen and watch the cut scenes. All in all, it is clear after completing the story (which I have) that Lee put in a lot of time and effort.\n\nHere is the main point I wanted to make about MyCareer. If you absolutely hate what 2K has done by implementing a more complex story, DO NOT WORRY! After your first season in the NBA (you play 8 games your rookie year), the story aspect ends. At this point, you play just like you would in 2K15. Taking on full seasons, talking to the press, signing endorsements, increasing your stats, ect. All of this, along with even more!\n\nWith those two issues being pushed aside, there are many positives in NBA 2K16. The music is the best I have heard yet, finally landing on many good & popular tracks. The customization has drastically improved, and all of the best modes are there. 2K will be releasing bug fixes and updates, so all of these negative reviews will hopefully be changing. As for me, I find it the best installment in the series, and have enjoyed every minute I have played so far.","October 1, 2015","true","177.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I hate that there isnt alot of offline in the myTeam as i hate the lag online but i just steak to mycareer and myleague modes. Got the game 3 days ago, it is buggy as hell on mycareer but im hoping they fix this soon because it makes the game pretty unplayable with missing pass icons, missing play call icons and stupid timeout calls when ur driving to the hoop but overall this game looks and plays amazing and unline konami with the crappy version of PES 2016 they released on PC, 2K sport actually respect PC players enough to give us a version of the game thats the same as the consoles","October 6, 2015","true","111.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My first impressions were decent of this game. MyCareer is my favorite mode, and they managed to make it somewhat dissapointing. How? by pumping up your player to be the next Superstar, but making him worse than a d-league player. It takes some real hard work to earn VC, but the real pain is that they wave a lot of VC points in your face in exchange for money. That's the equivalent of waving a juicy steak in your face, while you are poor as dirt. You can take the steak and eat it on the spot, or work at a dead end job that pays you way less than minimum wage, but you will eventually have enough to buy that steak. Beware! fun to play but also frustrating like opening a jar of golden nuggets. Oh, and also lots of bugs. LOTS OF THEM. Gameplay is weird sometimes, but overall a 8/10.","October 8, 2015","true","193.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Everyone I know over at the reddit.com/r/nba2k community agrees with me that the gameplay was made too difficult and that there are so many bugs in this game, this was by far the most sloppy release from 2k.\n\nI've been playing NBA2K for years and this feels like the most unrefined version of NBA2K ever, especially on the PC version. Rampant hackers, terrible story mode, gameplay was tweaked to be 'realistic' aka my gold and purple players can't make wide-open shots half the time.. Kevin Durant missing from 17' out on non-user mode is blasphemy.\n\nThis is extremely dissapointing because NBA2K was originally made to be better than NBA Live, now EA is going to take advantage of NBA2K's miscue because their game had a terrible director (Spike Lee). The entire storeline is forced and feels borderline racist, as NBA2K doesn't seem to realize how diverse their audience is.\n\nGo play NBA2K15, 2K games needs to fix this game and improve it. Their ticketing system looks like it's disabled because they're probably getting so many complaints.","October 8, 2015","false","73.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
