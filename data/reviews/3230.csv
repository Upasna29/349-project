It is silly but adding these empty folders resolves some of the problems such as the ships not loading. Click Read More if needed to see the fix.\n\n--\nGo to your Steam directory.\n\nIn Steam\steamapps\common\Genesis Rising\nCreate three new folders called 'replay','temp', and 'save' (without quotes)\n\nThen in Steam\steamapps\common\Genesis Rising\data\nCreate a new folder called 'scripts' (without quotes)\n--\n[Many thanks to Future2012 who originally posted this fix.]\n\nOther than that I didn't get any errors on Win7 64-bit when launching it so I don't know if compatibility mode would help or if it is an OS or driver issue. When I did the above fix I have been able to play through several missions without incident.\n\nAll that said, the game itself is really good and has everything from voice acting to cutscenes and a story with some deep religious undertones if you care for that, and if not then you still get to blow lots of stuff up and capture enemy ships and bases. In fact there are countless decisions you get to make about how you want to set up your ships and even which ships you want to take. Moreover I pose that you have likely never played a space game quite like it, as it has elements of RTS thrown in and on top of that your ships are ALIVE and can be genetically modified to suit your desires, and changed on the fly to boot. Plus the music and visuals are quite appealing, so if you can get it to work then it is easily worth $5 or more. Good luck!","January 3, 2014","true","8.4"," 185 of 206 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","185","206","2","5"

I do not want to be doing this. I'm one of those people that still believe computers are run by magic. I just want to play. Fortunatly for me, my 'friend' talked me through the set-up and his timeless advice of 'press ok until it works' when faced with error messages only four seconds into the game really displayed his numerous IT qualifications.\n\nWe both bought it with the intention of playing co-op, however I discovered after three minutes of sheer laughter down my microphone that online support had been withdrawn. Luckily for me the only option that I could access from the main menu was the credits.\n\nI discovered during watching the credits that the game had four advisors. I Would have thought that the first advice would be to make sure it works. At the time of writing my ex-friend is showing on steam as playing this game, I am sad to say he is silent. Dumbstruck.\n\nI'd like to end on a positive however as i know a lot of hard work goes into developing titles, The credits are lovely.\nWell Done Advised Advisors.

Points right there,.\n\nShips are customizable, and the take on how the ships work (read - organic ships, with your main resource being 'blood') is certainly different.\n\nBut it all still falls flat; Its buggy - but not unforgivingly so, The cut scenes where  juvenile to just plain boring. The ship combat was middling at best and restricted to a 2D plane and missions are nothing to write home about.\n\nIn the end the game has many problems easily forgivable on their own but this entire game is just one misstep after another.

I like the bioships, upgradable, custom builds, multiple endings.\n\nSadly I can´t give it a thumbs up, because the game crashes within the first few missions. I would gladly change my review if the developers would release a patch/working version.\nNOT WORKING, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION.\n\nUpdate:I tried the fix proposed by Sparta (the review below mine), be warned: Does not the fix the issue of the game crashing (for me at least).\nTried again on a different machine, because I´d really like to play this game again.

Unfortunately, on the very first mission my ship won't load which prevents me from finishing or even starting. I also have errors when I click the start button in my library. You can click through the 8+ errors and still launch but that never instills faith when starting a game. I would love to recommend Genesis Rising because of the concept, the music, and being able to enjoy the dying genre of space RTS but,  when there isn't a feasible work-around to the bugs or errors you have to call it what it is.

Voice acting is kinda wooden and lame at times, but the gameplay is solid and challenging with some nice and hard space battles. The idea of organic ships is original and the graphics are quite nice while exploring and battling other factions. Overall a nice little space strategy game.

Interesting approach to fleet building.\n\nI did experience bugs - Memory low and a few other CTDs - setting graphics to medium may have lessened these crashes alot. I owned this originally on DVD years back and the same errors happened on that one too.\n\nCharacters are ok, same with voice acting.  Nothing out of the ordinary on the missions. Religious rule backed by military based plot so expected something along what Star Trek V gave us. Even including a high-jacking too!\n\nIts fine if you want a game in the Homeworld style vein don’t expect it to exceed that in any way that as that truly a masterpiece.\n\nAs others have said get it on a sale – Its ok.

Got it from a Big Lots for like 6 bucks and took 3 or 4 cd's to download. It was unique (and weird in a way) but VERY entertaining. This version, and many like it, doesn't seem to work on Windows 7's. I looked into it and it seemed way to complicated to fix. When you start this up it will hint you with a message, then another, then another. Until you just cannot bare any longer and just hold down the ENTER key till it starts. Once it starts up everything is fine. However in the middle of loading the 1st mission (and if you even get passed that, those too do this) will create a dump file. Taking up reletively no space in your hard drive, but it's there. Anyway it also may freeze AND if you even get passed that to get to the actual first mission where young Icona gets his first ship. Everything is red and black checkers. A lot of missing textures and such. However there are fixes for these and its all over the discussions. I also have my own way that fixed it.","February 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

The game functions, which is more than I can say for a lot of games but it's so boring, simplistic and bare that what's the point?\n\nAlso the unit variety is shameful, a worker shared between factions, a capital ship, light, medium and heavy cruisers respectively. So that's what... three actual combat ships you can make per side? There's a few mercenary ships, but they can't be upgraded with extra rocket launchers so they aren't relevant.\n\nBasic maths aside, you probably shouldn't buy this game, it's a waste of money and if you desperately need to lose money then give it to a homeless person or buy a Freddo bar or something, anything but this.\n\n2.5/10.","June 2, 2014","false","1.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I keep buying these space sims, expecting something that actually attempts to simulate a spaceship. This is really a naval combat game without the water. It's 2-dimensional (the graphics are 3D but the actually playing field is not; you can only move in 2 dimensions). Say what you want about Homeworld not NEEDING a 3rd dimension; at least it had one.\n\nHaving said that, this is a pretty unique naval RTS. When you kill another ship, you get to harvest it for both health and abilities for your own ships. I've only played the first couple missions but the mechanics seem solid and the ship customization is very intuitive. Once you've killed a few enemies, it's very easy to customize your identical ships into specialized individuals.\n\nFor example: on the second tutorial mission, I loaded all my beams onto one ship, all my short-range projectiles onto the second and all my long-range missiles onto a third. What started out as three ships with two pea-shooters each quickly became a useful unit with very distinct roles.\n\nHaven't played far enough to say how the story or mission variation is but just based on the core gameplay elements, I recommend Genesis Rising.","July 14, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
