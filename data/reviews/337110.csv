"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pesteredit/recommended/337110/","pesteredit","PesterEdit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pesteredit/","452 products in account","Platformers are a tough game to get right, because the controls and level design both have to be perfect or else the whole thing falls apart. Unfortunately, Bard to the Future's controls are far from perfect. I played my entire time using a wired 360 for Windows controller and it was a half hour or so spent in utter frustration.\n\nThe main character is called a "BattleBard", and yet he has no ability to battle. You can jump on enemies or powerslide into them (but only if they are facing away from you.) Any momentum you are able to build up going through the level is lost when you have to stop and watch the movement pattern for the enemy as it begins and changes suddenly. If you miss the head by a matter of pixels, you're dead. If you powerslide as they turn around, you're dead. If you try to speed around them, the controls will not react quickly enough which will also kill you. One would think as a BattleBard you would get to actually... battle stuff without dying in a single touch.\n\nThat being said, I do not mind dying in games. It is something that can be used to make the experience more fun at times, but the points in the level that are respawn points after death are too far away from each other. After so much trial and error to get past a tiny portion, you immediately have to do that again when the controls don't let you jump at the exact moment you press the A button causing you to hit spikes. The respawn checkpoints also are not announced in anyway by the game. You've no clue where they are until you die. The game annoyingly pops up a death counter for 10+ deaths in a level and keeps counting with every death. There are also incredibly repetitive voice announcements of your death from the character every handful of deaths. Both of these only increase the frustration factor, especially after a death that is control-related.\n\nI've never before wanted a refund for a game I've bought from Steam, but I can no longer say that after my time with the BattleBard.\n\nTLDR:\n+ Fun storyline concept.\n+ Music is engaging.\n+ I appreciate the art style.\n+ It's five dollars.\n\n- Controls need to be fine-tuned. I'd settle for just being tuned at all though.\n- Respawn checkpoints spaced too far apart and are not announced by the game at all once crossed.\n- Comments from your character about his death get very old, very fast.\n- BattleBard is very easily killed by enemies.\n- I appreciate the voiceover for the cutscenes, but they are too long. I'd like to skip to the next line of dialogue when I'm done reading the caption versus using the entire-scene skip option provided.\n\nI'll keep an eye out for updates to see if any of these issues are addressed in the future, but I cannot recommend this game in its current form.","February 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","36","44","2","3"

For those of us who grew up in the 8-bit age, this was often the first and most-played genre that we had access to. Bard to the Future would have fit in perfectly with those days. A simplistic, straightforward adventure, Bard to the Future focuses on the misadventures of a so-called “Battlebard” and some unlikely companions that join the hero as he travels through time. Filled with difficult jump-heavy levels, an array of enemies, and some clever jokes, this title sounds promising to those of us who grew up on the genre. Does this time-travelling tale find a place in modern gaming, or is its true place back in the early days of gaming?\n\nBard to the Future begins with the heroic Battlebard — a half-bard, half-knight of some kind — in his own time. In desperate need of a toilet, he finds his way to a nearby porta-potty that, for some reason, he doesn’t question. Of course, the strange device turns out to be a time machine, and it’s not long before our protagonist finds himself in the modern world. Stumbling upon some lowly nerds in the midst of a pen-and-paper RPG, he makes quick friends after some rough introductions that include questioning whether or not a Battlebard is a legitimate class choice. After smoothing things over a bit, the three set out on a zany, disjointed quest through time, seeking to collect the pieces of a map leading to an ancient treasure.\n\nWhat Bard to the Future does well is, unfortunately, mostly limited to the cute story and largely well-written humor. Unfortunately, the rest of the game feels pretty subpar. Enemies, while varied in their appearances, are all on simple back-and-forth tracks, and the traditional falling-projectile element offers little variety. While the armor-clad Battlebard might look formidable, defeating foes is only accomplished by jumping on them or executing a “power slide” from behind. Striking enemies from the front, like most anything else, results in immediate death. The controls are loose and difficult to get a handle on, especially in areas where the level environment includes elements like slick ice or small platforms in rapid sequence.\n\nWhile Bard to the Future seems to flounder in a lot of ways, the quick-witted writing brings some much needed respite to frustrating play. The Battlebard even offers up quips upon death, including asking the player if they’re killing him on purpose when the death toll reaches ten or more in a single level. It’s a good thing that the story and dialogue offer something fresh, because the rest of the game is pretty uninspired. While the sound and graphics aren’t horrid, they’re certainly not enough to breathe life into an otherwise bland experience.\n\nProbably the best thing that I can say about Bard to the Future is that, with a meager 4,99€ price tag, it’s an easy buy-in to take a flyer on. While I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone but hardcore devotees of the 2D platformer or indie games, it’s at least in the bargain bin status that it likely belongs in. With some good wit and an interesting enough concept, it presents a few reasons for the curious to check out. Still, with an unimpressive overall aesthetic, floundering controls, and skimpy level design, I’d say your money is better spent on something with a bit more meat to it.","February 20","true","30.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

I was really looking forward to this game, because I love games that utilize a medieval setting or characters. However, this game fell flat on many levels.\n\nMost disappointing was the controller function and actual gameplay mechanics. I found myself getting very frustrated, because the controls were inconsistent when utilizing a wired xbox 360 controller. No two jumps seem to be timed the same. There is often a delay, and the distance isn't predictable. I also found that forward motion plus the jump button resulted in my character falling off of platforms or completely missing jumps from one platform to another. In order to make certain jumps, I had to stand still, jump, then apply the forward motion or powerslide in order for the controls to be effective. That I could get used to, if it were consistent, but it wasn't. Once I adopted that controller pattern, things didn't get better and instead got even quirkier. My character would now make the jump, but it would also backslide off of the platform I'd just reached only to fall onto spikes below and die. Between the "slippery" platform surfaces and inconsistent controls, the game became devoid of all enjoyment for me at this point.\n\nOther noticeable issues that could have been overlooked from a player's perspective were the poor grammar and sentence structure in the dialogue boxes and the stark contrast between the characters on the screen and the charaacter faces in the dialogue box. This seemed like a "rookie" mistake and was a distraction for me.\n\nThe soundtrack was average, not exceptional, but the graphics were much better than average. I think with some effort into gameplay mechanics, the developer could have a winner here. When those updates are made, I'd be glad to give the game another try.","April 25","false","0.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Its character portraits, writing, music, and voice acting are great; its in-game graphics and actual gameplay are seriously lacking.\n\nGraphically, the game would be much better if it picked a pixel size and stuck with it. As for the gameplay, it's buggy, it's frustrating, and it commits the ultimate platforming sin: the hitboxes are unpredictable, which makes it impossible to tell whether you'll stomp on one of Bard to the Future's swift, erratically-moving enemies or be killed by it.\n\nAs much charm as the game has, it's not quite charming enough to overcome its flaws.","April 22, 2015","false","1.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I play a lot of platforming games and this is just as enjoyable as most of them. No, the controls aren't on par with super meatboy, but they're far from what I would consider an issue with the game. There are however a couple things that I find slightly annoying. Battlebards voice seems to be much louder than the other characters, which is unfortunate as the voice acting for the other characters is much more well done in my opinion. My only other complaint is the hitboxes on some enemies are somewhat ridiculous, and when trying to jump on an enemies head if you're off even slightly, you're going to die. The difficulty level has been pretty decent so far, nothing too crazy..but still difficult enough to make a me a little irritated in some areas. With a little more work this could truly be a great game, and I look forward to completing it.","February 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

The controls are imprecise, to say the least. It's been said before, but you want to feel that you've died because of something you've done, and not because you pressed the right button at the right time and the game registered it too late. It gets some style points for the graphics, and even for some of the writing, but those things mean nothing if the gameplay isn't fun. Not to mention, the different voices seem to have been recorded with different equipment. There's heavy background noise on the "hero", and it makes the game feel amateurish.\n\nI agree with the NPCs: there's no such thing as a battlebard.
