However, due to this, the game does tend to feel more like Portal without a Portal Gun than a game from the Penumbra series. While it not may live up to expectations brought to the table by Black Plague, it's a satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy.","August 14, 2015","true","5.0"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","4"

However, if you liked the story of Penumbra this is a great conclusion for the series.\n\nRequiem takes a whole new approach to the Penumbra series: no monsters are encountered, so instead of being a horror game with puzzle elements this is now a puzzle game with horror elements. Keep in mind that Requiem is about 4 hours long (Black Plague is about 8 and Overture is about 12) and is not "Penumbra 3" but instead an expansion pack for Black Plague. Don't expect a full length story like the first two games, but that being said the story in Requiem is great for an expansion pack. It's actually quite scary at times, and it takes true horror craftmanship to scare the player while there is no physical threat to their character.\n\nThe puzzles are by far the best of the Penumbra series. They blow the Overture/Black Plague puzzles out of the water and are a lot of fun. They're not too hard and not too easy, which makes for a nice difficulty. Requiem is the only game in the Penumbra series where I felt the pacing was uninterrupted; don't get me wrong, Overture and Black Plague are great games but were often *plagued* by clunky action mechanics (Overture only) and occasionally bad puzzles.","February 15, 2015","true","20.8"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"

Well, you get an interesting answer in Requiem, which kind of poses more interesting questions than answers.\n\nRequiem is all about the puzzles. There are 9 levels (puzzles) and as you solve each one, there are interesting books, artifacts, and audio recordings to discover that piece together the current reality you are experiencing. This game isn't scary like the first two in the series, but it does maintain that dark and foreboding atmosphere. Personally, I'm glad there were no monsters stalking me, since I died enough trying to solve the puzzles.\n\nNow are the puzzles hard? Yes....and no.....sort of. The puzzles start off easy, then even though you know how to solve it, you have to execute it just right or start over. Thats where it got kind of annoying for me, since my timing can be less than great. I also like to overjump platforms a lot and jump to my death. So, if you have an excellent sense of timing and depth perception, you should have no problem.\n\nNow there really isn't a story per se, since it just build off from the last two games. There are two endings plus an optional extra ending if you find each artifact hidden in each level. I was content to get the regular two endings and Youtube the special one, since I was in no mood to look for all the artifacts and solve the puzzles. This game gave me serious feelings of nausea since I had to repeatedly try to do puzzles correctly (jumping platforms, falling, moving puzzles).\n\nI really enjoyed the dissent into madness and "meeting" the fellow insane people that have been dropped in the facility. The sound really keeps you on edge. The graphics would only let me play on the lowest settings, despite me trying to change the screen resolution repeatedly. If anyone ever finds a fix let me know. This was a minor annoyance to me, since graphics in a game like this is secondary criteria.\n\nI feel a sense of accomplishment after playing this, and while it is not really a full "game" like the two previous Penumbra titles, it should be played to enrich the Penumbra experience.  I am also looking forward to playing Penumbra: Necrologue!","March 25","true","15.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","1"

If you've played through Overture and Black Plague then you probably want to take the story to completion.\n\nThe problem really is that this installment doesn't really do that. As a standalone puzzle experience it's not a bad little game but as part of the Penumbra series it falls short.\n\nIn essence, unlike the previous games with areas that naturally followed on and progressed with a story, Requiem is split into individual unrelated puzzles. Maybe something you've encountered in a previous area will help you understand a new one but that aside there's no real flowing narrative. The whole "find x number of keys to exit the area" feels a little cheap too with no real explanation.\n\nIn addition there are no enemies and not much interaction beyond pulling some boxes and turning values. Whilst some areas do have the spooky unsettling feel, after you've fallen off into the water and had to swim all the way back for 15th time the atmosphere tends to wane.\n\nSo to buy? If you want a fairly short puzzle game then Requiem isn't a bad choice. However if you're looking for a solid finish to the Penumbra story I think you'll be disappointed as nothing is really added beyond the conclusion of the second game.\n\nI'll go with "yes" because Requiem isn't a bad use of your time, but just be aware of what it is and what it isn't.","January 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, the wat! story line continues with some mysterious voice(s) guiding you through and the ending is left to major interpretation.  It should have kept it simplier than trying to do too much story wise.\n\nThis is a puzzle game, no stealth or creatures like the other two games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/22140/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Penumbra Requiem is an expansion pack for Penumbra Black Plague, still developed by Frictional Games and released in 2008. While Penumbra series wrapped up as duology, developers still decided to give more. With "more" being a collection of puzzles that demonstrate engine or just didn't make it into main games. No horror, no adventure, no narrative to speak of. Any wonders why people get dissapointed when they expect it to be the final part of trilogy?\nNo, this nice castle screenshot on store page isn't from game, but concept art for another project.\n\nAlso, I actually encountered some tehnical issues. First, I managed to make some objects to fall through geometry, so don't try to mess too much. At least it wasn't important stuff. Second, game refused to launch after I restarted my laptop until I deleted setting config file. Actually I think that these issues are in previous Penumbra games too, just didn't get to encounter them until now.\n\nPlot starts where Black Plague ended, as you get knocked out by somebody approaching form behind. After that you will appear in a very strange places, tomb and industrial dark structures. There is no real narrative, instead it will be almost dream-like with random pieces of voices coming through.\nIt does have 2 endings. Which is made through choice in the final room. Everybody was doing that few years ago, it viewed cool. At least developers weren't bragging about moral choice and multiple endings, so will do.\n\nAnd most of your time will be spent searching for keys in each of 9 levels, giving it more of game-like quality as well. While there are no inventory puzzles at all, no notes and even your flashlight never runs out, you will be still doing a lot of them, after all there is nothing else to it. So be ready to pulls things using physics, pull switches, jump around a lot, throw explosive ketchup and platform like Donkey Kong. Yea, platforming. At least it's forgiving, though jumping is not controllable enough for Penumbra to have such platforming.\n\nAnd monsters were completely removed. There is almost no horror. Now, there was a level where I felt like I was being stalked, but there was nothing to be truly afraid of. Because of this atmoshpere, while providing ambient music and dark places, took a hit as well.\n\nTo be honest, if it wasn't part of Penumbra series, it would have been barely appealing at all for me. It does get boring without good narrative or horror, with levels mostly being dark and with no points of interests. While puzzles are good, the pacing doesn't manage to hook player, ever. In the end it makes me question for who this expansion pack was designed for. The only reason for it to exist is "didn't want puzzle ideas to go to waste" after all. Plot didn't tie any loose ends either.\nNo, it still made me think occasionally, it still is fine. Just nothing great. Like a tech demo of engine. But not as exciting as actual Penumbra tech demo, yes.\n\nAlso, you can still collect all statues to get a bit more of text at the end of a game and get password for secret in-game computer where you also have to do a special action just to get to voice acting blooper.","October 19, 2015","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You still have a journal, and an inventory with a bunch of crud, and you can still go into hiding mode by crouching, but at no point in the game will you [have] to use any of it, save for maybe the painkillers if you happen to slip off an extraordinarily high ledge.\n\nNothing special, but if you were gonna buy Black Plague anyway you might as well give it a spin.","October 30, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is not much story and it makes no sense, but it's creepy. It's very short, I finished it without walkthrough in about 3 hours but it came free with the Black Plague, so this is not a problem. If you liked the puzzles in pervious games then you should try this, but if you are just interested in story then there aren't much in here, so you can skip this.","September 15, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike the previous games, this one is entirely focused on puzzle solving. That is to say that there are no monsters in it. Although it is still a great game, you won't be jumping out of your seat every 5 minutes. However, in no way am I implying it is boring. The puzzles will encourage the player to think and use their environment to move ahead.\n\nConsider this an epilogue to the series, almost as if the game is finally giving you a break from all the previous horror. Instead of focusing on potential enemies, sit back, relax, and focus on the story and the conclusion to Phillip's hellish adventure.","November 16, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one. It's even worse than the first installment. No horror elements this time. Just randomly secluded puzzles and a weak conclusion of the whole story in the end. I would give this game a thumbs up if the puzzles were good, but no, they're terrible.","March 19","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I soon learned the horrifying truth... that this would be a horror game! Environmental hazards, item puzzles, confusion, darkness and fear of the unknown... I immediately started thinking of jump scares and Amnesia, so it was a relief to learn this was made by the same creators of Amnesia so this would be a high-quality Amnesia clone by people who knew what they were doing. Because they did it before. Several times. If you like atmospheric story-heavy horror games where you run and hide like a little baby because light attracts danger, this will be right up your alley. If you're like me and would rather punch the monsters in the face or at the very least NOT have to cower and run and hide while piecing together the story, you should play Skyrim or Le Chuck's Revenge instead.","March 14","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

PROs and CONs first. Then some comments & random notes I have about the game.\n(note, my #/10 score = gameplay+graphics/sound+story etc.. + my enjoyment)\n\nPROs:+many puzzles\n+different types of puzzles (platforming, switch puzzles, pressure plate puzzles, companion cube puzzles etc..)\n+atmospheric (peaceful but eerie at times)\n\nCONs:-some puzzles are just annoying to do\n-careful with elevators (my boxes bugged out)\n\nComments:It is a basically expansion pack for those whole like puzzles. There ain't no enemies. It is purely puzzle solving.\nMost of the times puzzles were okay. There were unique puzzles in their own way and some somewhat difficult. Though few puzzles annoyed me (mostly 2 platforming spots) and few that forced back n forward running.\n\nAside that it was 2 hours experience for me. It was okay, puzzle "fanservice" Penumbra game.\n\nThough, I'll be honest. The expansion started where game ended "kill them all" and then next scene you are just solving puzzles. Found it a bit funny.\n\nPure puzzle game, no enemies or horror of any sorts. Only eerie soundtrack at times\n\n6/10","May 19","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
