One of my personal all-time favorites, F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0 is the sequel to the ground-breaking 1988 stealth flight simulator F-19 Stealth Fighter. If you like stealth games, this one's for you. Attack Saddam Hussein's palace in the Desert Storm campaign, blow up a submarine pen in the North Cape, take off from Key West, Florida and attack targets in Cuba, storm the Iron Curtain in the Central European campaign, take out (virtual) targets in North Korea, Vietnam, and many other scenarios. Each mission is different; no two missions are alike. Choose between the more realistic Lockheed version, or play Microprose's version (bullets, two more weapons bays, and Sidewinder and AMRAAM air-to-air missiles).\n\nThe game comes with the manual (for free) in PDF format. The manual will automatically be downloaded into your "\SteamLibrary\SteamApps\common\F-117A NightHawk Stealth Fighter" folder when you download the main game itself. You will need the free Adobe Reader to view it. http://get.adobe.com/reader Also, the control instructions are included. The file is called F-177A Key Control Card.PDF and is located in the "Bonus Content" folder. It is a necessity for people who are unfamiliar with the game's controls.\n\nYou can use the DosBox DAUM mode for better compatibility with more modern computers. Press Ctrl+V to turn off the shrill engine sound, if it bothers you. Also, to get the game to perform smoother and play faster, go into windowed mode (Alt+Enter) and press Ctrl+F12 several times until it gets up to 15,000 cycles. Make sure you do this before you calibrate your joystick at the game's startup menu. Then you can go back into fullscreen mode (Alt+Enter), if you wish.\n\nBuy this game. Seriously, it's worth every penny. Plus, you'll have it on your Steam account forever.","November 7, 2014","true","10.0"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"

The graphics are 20+ years old, for sure..but the gameplay!\n\nIf you have ANY interest in the genre, treat yourself to this game! It also has the advantage over the Good Old Games version in that the look up copy protection is disabled. This was a pain in the but..as you had to correctly identify an airplane from the manual...and this meant you had to print out the manual, and they hope the quality of the print was good enough to tell the planes apart!\n\nI highly recommend this game.

And that's high praise given how great F-19 was/is.\n\n\nPRO TIPS FROM THE PROS:\n- Tired of hearing the engine whine? alt + v will let you cycle through different levels of sound. All but the highest leave out engine noises.\n- On a long boring stretch of flying back to your landing site, with nothing to do in the meantime? Alternate hitting shift + z and shift + x every couple of seconds. Shift + z speeds up time, but only seems to work for a few seconds. shift + x puts you back into normal mode.\n- The way to earn the big points is on Cold War, not Conventional War. You make more points for flying around unseen than you ever could from blowing stuff up\n- If your game is running really choppily and your controls suck, it's not the game. What you're experiencing is lag. "Lag? This game? On my modern machine? How could that be?" Well, DOSBox isn't emulating a modern machine. Throw some more cycles it's way with ctrl f12. Somewhere in the 15000 cycles range will cure all your problems (default is 9000)\n\nMore controls here: http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/docs.php?id=603","September 24, 2015","true","0.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","1"

It's a bundled DOS game, so keep in mind the graphics and controls are going to look pretty dated.  It's also a flight simulator, so don't expect an arcade feel with lots of action.  Missions involve avoiding raidar detection, using defenses to avoid getting shot, bombing a site, and escaping.  Basically, it's not for everyone, but still pretty good.\n\nMissions are pretty straight forward, but the controls are a bit confusing at first, so here's some stuff to start off with:\n\nTaking off:\nAdjust thust with - and =\npull up landing gear with 6 and open flaps with 7\n\nFlyling:\nuse numpad or arrow keys (I don't think there is a way to yaw though)\ntoggle autopilot with 7\n\nWeapons:\ncycle through missles with space, open the bay with 8, and fire with enter\nfire guns with backspace\n\nDefenses:\n1 - 5 are chaffs, flairs, decoys and jamming\n\nDisplay Controls:\nF keys\n\nPause and Quit\nAlt+P and Alt+Q\n\nThere is also a Key Control Card pdf in the Bonus Content folder located in the Steam directory that is pretty handy.\n\n\nEDIT:\nI attempted the first mission several times and the game kept crashing before I could land to complete the mission.  I'm not sure if the game is broken under DOSBox, or if there is some issue running it under Linux.  Good game, but it looks like it's unplayable for me (and it looks like some others as well).  I'm going to have to unreccomend this until I find a solution.","November 2, 2014","false","1.4"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","24","46","0","0"

But after having the time to get used to the controls again, I do remember why I love it: this was probably the earliest "serious" combat "flight sim" I ever played. A friend and I played this on his dad's computer, spending hours trying to figure out how best to play it. And yeah, for all its modern simplicity, it still feels good to be able to run randomly generated missions, blow up a few SAM installations, and somehow land in all its sub-480p goodness.\n\nI don't recommend it to anyone that doesn't have that nostalgia factor, but then, those people probably wouldn't buy it. It is, for folks of my generation, a classic.\n\nOh, and tip: Don't pick the Adlib setting in the sound card stuff, seems to crash constantly. Pick Roland. Slightly less good but it's all so bad you never notice anyway.","December 24, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the discounted price (2€), pretty neat, once you memorize the keymap. Flight dynamics are not the best (like doing turns with 90+ degree roll), lack of yaw and somewhat erratic stall. But overall for a game from 1991, this is really good.\n\nLandings are challenging - not only because runways (especially carriers) are a pixelated mess and really short. On the bright side braking distance is almost zero, there are no bounces and vertical velocity is pretty forgiving even on max realism.","December 14, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

BUG1... doesn't let you do that - unlike Novalogic's F-33 Lightning 3 or the other novalogics Mig-29 Fulcrumn & F-16.\n\nBeing a pilot is heavily dependent on patience and resource management (yes even your energy momentum)... of course this is a good old sim and this mission ALONE was worth the Dollar and a half spent... I come from the days of DOS and having played that other fantastic (at the time) title JETFIGHTER II...well... takes me back to a good old time...\n\nNew (often impatient) players won't much appreciate the 'crappy' everything... but for the curious few who want a night at the flight sim museum,,, have a crack at the training mission and at least land safely without all the modern day assists to walk away feeling accomplished... this game is available in hundreds of places for free on-line but I bought it as a THANK YOU to micro-prose...\n\nAs Tiony timo a.k.a ( BIA_ASKARI_TIMBO ) once told me: If you liked the game - support the developers. Thanks Tim!\nthis also has the 'identify airplane' feature removed-so easy play... AAND no-crashes as long as you dont alt-tab in the middle of play (use Alt-p to pause THEN alt-tab to look for keys or whatever)\n\nFor those of you horrified at the details settings... well do NOT press Alt/D!! it has detail settings for x286 Cpu's and 'anything else' [below that] - my nVidia 970GTX musta been filing its fingernails at that... in its sleep. Hard to believe the computer that took Apollo to the moon (if you believe that) barreled along at a blazing 1Mhz...\n\nBuy this if its for a buck and if you were a Flight-sim fanatic. or just for a must-have collectible for your library.
