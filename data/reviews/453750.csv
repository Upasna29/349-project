I expected a kind of boring edutainment game about ecology and instead got a fun and fascinating look into how biomes work and have learned a surprising amount. It's really a lot of fun and dragged me in almost immediately. I'm constantly wondering how my biome is doing and if I put down too many things the last time I was on. The devs also are very active on the forums and open to feedback and suggestions.\n\nThis isn't really a game that you sit down for hours and hours and play. You can and I've seen myself playing longer than expected but it doesn't really seem intended for that sort of play. Time passes while you don't play and so you hop on to check on how things are going and if your latest additions screwed up your balance or not. The best thing is that you can adjust the maximum amount of time that will pass while you're away. It defaults to a week but you can set it to a month or 3 months. I've found that 3 months actually isn't that bad but it's a great setting that more games that do this kind of thing need to implement. It's nice to know that my going to sleep/work won't cause a year+ of in game time to pass.\n\nI highly recommend this huge surprise of a game if you want something that is engaging and completely open ended. It's difficult but that's really just because biomes are complicated and it's a lot of trial and error. Definitely expect to restart your biomes a couple times simply because your experiment failed. It's a fantastic game and it's way more engaging and interesting than I expected.\n\nI will definitely buy any and all DLC that might be released (The devs haven't said anything about DLC, just me hoping/speculating).","May 6","true","8.9"," 63 of 68 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","63","68","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkaura304/recommended/453750/","Darkaura304","Sentient Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkaura304/","1449 products in account","This game is all about balancing an ecosystem, which sounds easy in theory, but can be much more challenging than you'd actually think. There are three different kinds of ecosystems you can work with: desert, plains, and rainforest. Each one has its own challenges to overcome and its own flora and fauna to interact with each other.\n\nThere are three kinds of living things that you can place in your biodome: consumers, producers, and decomposers; within the consumer category, there are four kinds: herbivore, carnivore, insectivore, and omnivore.\n\nBalancing an ecosystem can be challenging as you need to place each of those previous mentioned living entities in such a way that they interact in a positive and beneficial way, not only to themselves, but to the flora and fauna around them.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is very well-done. It's simple, yet full of so much thought and preparation. If you're getting this game for an educational purpose, I don't think you will be disappointed.\n\nIf you are getting this game in order to mess around and try to break the ecosystem, have fun. During my gameplay, I intentionally starved several carnivores just to see what would happen. The poor things dropped like a bad habit.\n\nIn any case, I highly recommend this game. The price is reasonable for what you're getting and if you balance your biodomes properly, you can have several long hours observing the impact of your decisions over the course of in-game weeks, months, and years.","April 14","true","4.9"," 64 of 77 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","64","77","3","1"

While that may be true in the limited number of "players in the game”, within those diverse players that are included there is NO shortage of complex interaction. As I expand the scope of my own TE creation, resulting in the increased need for answers to more multifaceted questions (a reflection of the environment itself, perhaps), I am constantly astounded as to just how complex the overall interaction is. Clearly not by accident, but precisely as intended. The complexity reveals itself slowly through necessity, as is done with any extremely well designed game. And these DEVS know exactly of what they speak, and say it extremely well. And with great passion.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTyto Ecology is an oddly titled game perhaps, but no less significant in many important ways. In its most basic form it’s simply a bio-dome, in which a specific Earth environment is reproduced in perpetuity (with hope, luck and skill.) The player has a given space to fill to whatever degree desired with flora and fauna, plant and animal life to coexist as a single unit of many diverse parts (as humans have largely failed to do in the bigger world.) In a larger aspect this is an opportunity to understand mistakes made and do it right, while gaining a grasp of the balance necessary in all aspects of life. And it has baby bunnies! And snakes!\n\nFirst, the basics of Tyto Ecology. The player begins with a simple tutorial that almost completely explains the balance of life in about five minutes. Yes, it could be argued that this game is vastly oversimplified….and it would be true. But this game is to show the way, not to recreate the world. In the words of one of the DEVs, “nature is so ridiculously complex that a truly "accurate" simulator would cause the ecosystem to die every single time. How nature has managed to balance itself out for as long as it has is a question that puzzles even those who have dedicated their lives to its study!)” (Thank you creekit, hope it’s OK.) The line must be drawn somewhere, and perhaps time and success will move that line somewhat. (This player’s suggestion; the tutorial is necessary and valuable, but may not be the best starting point for a “real” game. Perhaps many players would wish to start slower than to introduce bobcats to jackrabbits in the first three minutes. No action performed can be reversed. If one makes a mistake, only further actions can eliminate it……..with time.)\n\nAs Tyto Ecology progresses you receive two types of “purchasing power” (since this IS a game, after all.) The lightning bolts accumulate quickly with time, and are used as the means by which to add each plant group or animal colony as often or to as many locations as each player sees fit. The “T” tokens accumulate more slowly as specific rewards, and are the means by which each plant or animal TYPE is unlocked, and is only done once. Ever. (No matter how many bio-domes you control, apparently.) In theory, the payments become of altered significance over time, especially the tokens. It’s also built into the game to use tokens to perform emergency actions when needed.\n\nFor this reason, the first “game”, or bio-dome one controls is a completely different experience from any other. In the first game, choices tend to go from small to large expenditure / life form. In subsequent games there is no restriction, as all life forms are available from the first moment. As such the additions may be based on their impact as much as game need. (Mice can be HUGE!) While existing domes can be deleted for new ones to be started, any unlocked life form seems to be forever unlocked.\n\nThe goal of Tyto Ecology is equilibrium. Establish enough plants, and types of plants, to act as food and shelter for whatever types and quantities of animals you include. The animals must also be food for other animals, so there must be enough of each to reproduce at the rate necessary to replace those that don’t run fast enough or hide well enough. Plants must also reproduce, so pollinators are included: bees and moths. Armadillos (and others) need “bugs” to eat, so you may need to include ants and millipedes near any armadillo colonies you add. Are there enough bugs? You have the ability to constantly monitor the hunger, health and number of members for each colony. Players also receive notifications when things start to go wrong. (Although this player is still largely uncertain as to how to respond to a message about “declining mushroom health”.) Mushrooms, you say? Yes, without mushroom and millipedes, debris and carrion would accumulate to unhealthy levels, so they must be included. And they are both also very tasty! YUM!\n\nTyto Ecology opens with a desert ecosystem available. Later, tokens can be used to unlock Rainforest, Grassland, and perhaps other later. Admittedly, this player only has a few hours in the game, and the achievements extend for fifty years. Yes, fifty years. No worries, you won’t have to abandon every other game, as well as your job and family. (But you can!) The game operates at an accelerated pace, as well as allowing players the option to speed the game while playing. When players leave the game they may select the maximum amount of time to pass in the interim: none, one week, one month or three months (with the warning that three months is HARD!) The DEVs resisted the temptation for the selected time period to pass instantly, so the player must actually stay away from the game for some unknown period for the maximum time to pass. When players return they will be notified of any issues to have arisen, and how many tokens may have been earned.\n\nNo, Tyto Ecology doesn’t have impressive graphics. But to choose between having or waiting, most likely the proper choice was made. And Tyto Ecology may not include enough variables to make a serious environmentalist or biologist content, but for the casual player or student (perfect for a classroom) this should be adequate to make one feel they have more understanding of the workings of nature than previously. Or if you simply love animals and nature, this is a very special experience (especially the first time you have BABIES!) If the remarkable enthusiasm of the DEVs is any measure, this game should be very successful, especially if they continue constantly improving it as they are doing as we “speak”.\n\nThank you.","April 17","true","29.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","12"

If you don't like that, this game may be tough to find fun. However, if you are willing to check back every so often, the game has incredibly well designed ecosystem development and many options for flora and fauna for each of its (currently?) three biome types. The gameplay is mostly placing animals and plants in a custom ecosystem you create from scratch. The longer it works and the more diverse you make your miniature worlds, the more the game rewards you with coins, which let you unlock new animals, plants, etc. Be careful though, as fast breeding grasses and rabbits can overrun the entire environmental plan you thought you had set up, or the extra foxes you put in ate all the herbivores and starved. The only constant is that no plan ever works out perfectly, as the interactions always tend to surprise you each time you log back in. The camera feature gives you extra oppertunities to do some non-ecological work, such as taking snapshots of a bunch of baby hares roaming around in your custom made desert bush garden, or peeking at a sleeping turtle.\n\nThe devs are wonderful, active, and more friendly than every other early access devs I have ever talked to. A simple email or a forum post will get their attention, and they will contact you in a timely manner with support and/or response to your feedback.\n\nAt this time, however, there are certain things that I found midly troublesome (not to say they ruined my experience, but these small things could greatly improve my gameplay). Listed below:\n-clipping (animals can go inside of large trees, making it hard to spot them as well as slightly damaging the realism the game is going for)\n-swimming for animals. Not just for realism (which would be amazing in its own right), but because like the tree clipping, it can be hard to spot animals "buried" beneah water. Again with both issues (this and tree clipping) it isn't a huge concern, due to the fact that the need to see individual animals is somewhat small, but it would be nice to keep track of certain smaller populations (such as bobcats or foxes) on a more precise and individual scale without having to look inside of large trees (such as kapok).\n-not being able to pan the strategic camera (the top down view) while trying to place animals or plants (I have not yet played around much with the new beta so this may be completely fixed)\n-not being able to see which population I'm being alerted about (a snap to function would be amazing)\nAgain, this game is lots of fun and functions as a good creative outlet, and for 7$ it is easily worth the cost.","May 13","true","5.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

There are a lot of bugs and optimisation issues as of right now. I say wait before bying it but if you're interested put it in your wishlist so you don't forget! It's got a lot of potential!\n\n---\n\nAll right, here comes the much longer text!\n\nLet's start with the gameplay.\nOne thing that I noticed early on is that it's a rather slow and not very difficult game. This is how it works: You place animals and plants in a biodome. In order to place things you have to spend energy. Energy slowly trickles in as time passes in the biodome. As soon as you get comfortable placing things in the biodome you'll spend most of your time just sitting around waiting for more energy. Even on fast forward I spend almost more time waiting than placing things. As your biome gets bigger and you unlock more things (including a higher energy cap) it gets better but I still find myself waiting around a lot for more energy. (Maybe this could be helped a bit by adding a feature or even an unlockable upgrade that gives you energy faster but only when you're low on energy?)\n\nOne of the things I enjoy the most about this game however is decorating. But also this I wish was better... The problem is that often you plant the smaller plants several at the time and if even ONE of these overlap another plant you can't place them down. I wish that different types of plants could overlap. Obviously trees and bushes can't overlap but what about bushes and grass? I see no reason why they shouldn't be able to occupy the same space. And also, I'd like the ability to rotate things before I put them down. That would solve a big part of my problem with placing several plants at once. I would also like to be able to move the camera while placing... It's a small problem but annoying to me none the less.\n\nBesides this it is also rather easy to figure out how to keep a stable biodome. If you use common sense you'll get a long way.\nHere's the best strategy: Have loads of plants for your herbivores, have a lot more herbivores than carnivores and have loads of stuff that reduces detritus. That's pretty much it. As long as you don't go crazy and put down five colonies of snakes all at once like an idiot you'll do fine. The only threat is detritus. And even that doesn't seem so bad. I once managed to reach the highest level of detritus and... not a lot happened to be honest. I lost a handful of animals but not a single colony, I got it down again and that was it. Speaking of, I'd like the ability to sort the animals after diet, energy cost, size and so on...\n\nOkay, so the game is easy and there's no real challenge. So what? This is a slow and chill game about nature. You can just kick back, relax and enjoy the atmosphere right?\nWell, sadly, this is where the rest of the problems come in... The controls are bad. It sounds bad. It looks bad. REALLY bad... In the game's defense though this is known by the devs, they're working on it and it might very well turn out amazing in the end!\n\nAnyway, starting with the most important part. The controls are clunky.\nThere are three ways of viewing this game.\n- A strategic overview\n- Third person, as a small hovering drone.\n- First person, through the drone's camera. (This is only used to take photos and works fine, I won't talk about it.)\n\nThe drone controls terribly in third person. It's got MMO-like controls and feels stilted and restrictive. I don't like it at all so if I can avoid it I never play the game like this. This is being changed by the devs however and when it does I'll happily use it.\nThe strategic view has it's own fair share of problems. In this one you cannot, unlike the third person controls, zoom in or out. If you zoom in the view turns to third person. Sure, that's a cute gimmick and I get why you did it because the views are kind of hierarchical but it limits all three views something incredible. I constantly find myself squinting my eyes in this view trying to see the smaller plants and what is actually happening. We desperately need the ability to zoom in all three views! Another problem with the strategic view is that it moves superslow and there's no way to rotate the view. This isn't a big deal at the beginning but as soon as you place trees you get all kinds of problems seeing what's behind them. Most of what I've pointed out here is being worked on though and I look forward to the updates!\n\nAnd so we finally arrive at the sound and graphics.\nUnfortunately I can almost say nothing about the sound. The music is fine but personally I don't enjoy music in my games so that's a mute point for me. Due to a bug there are no animal or environmental sounds so... sadly, I can't say anything about that.\nAnd the graphics... Oh, god, as a graphics artist myself I weep over the graphics. The artists obviously aren't bad! What exists is totally fine. It's a pleasant style although some colours need to be tweeked to fit better with each other, I feel. Sadly, at the moment, it's locked at a terribly low resolution rate due to optimisation issues. Graphics options and fixes are coming but at the moment it's really bad. In some places and with some meshes it's so low res that I have problems telling what things are. Besides this there are SO many small tricks I dearly wish they will implement to add some artificial variety to the few meshes they have. Randomly rotating and resizing the meshes would help as now every single plant of the same kind looks exactly the same, facing the same way. It's a real shame. The animals are a bit better but they're still far too low resolution. The animations are simple and stilted and could do with a touch up. There is a lot of work to be done with the graphics. I WANT a reason to use that first person camera view! If his game looked and sounded good I'd love to sweep through the dome, just looking at things and enjoying it!\n\nAnd finally, as a last note... the only actual "learning" in this game is outside of the gameplay. It's just text and images in dossier-style, completely separate. I'm not sure how much you actually learn from this game. You may as well read a book or watch a documentary. I would suggest attempting to work small fact text bubbles into the game. I would be superhappy playing the game and suddenly having a little text pop up above my badger pupulation that says "Did you know badgers eat frogs, insects and even bees and snakes?". Because that's not only interesting but also useful in the game!","April 17","false","15.5"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","26","38","0","4"

Very simple but very fun: it plays a lot more like a "hands-off" strategy game than something like Civilization. You have a number of points that can be spent on using your trusty "Owlbot" to interact directly with a biome of your choice (currently desert, grassland, or rainforest). Adding plants, animals, and detritivores all consume these points. Successfully maintaining your biome unlocks a second currency that allows you to purchase additional plants and creatures to increase your biodiversity (there are NO real money transactions). The goal is to introduce plants and animals that are all in balance and can eventually maintain your ecosystem without your involvement at all.\n\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend it if you're a bit of an amateur naturalist such as myself.

I regularly search for better genetic, evolution, and ecology simulators and games.  It's a narrow field, sadly, and most of the options are really quite limited.\n\nThis is not a perfect game of its type, but it is closer to perfect than about 95% of similar games and simulations I have played with.  And I've been searching for games like this for decades.\n\nIt's dev team are currently 'fall over themselves eager' to interact with their playerbase, always a nice trait to see.  The game is not listed as 'early access', because as a developer explains in a news post, to be early access you need to be committed to develop the game further 'no matter what', and for this team, further development was only an option if the game sold well 'enough'.\n\nApparently it is selling well enough - the team seems profoundly excited and active!  I feel like my purchase is a plant set down in their herbivore territory, here are my 5 leaves, please eat them and make more programming!  Not quite how it works in their game, but close enough.  The game, though not listed as early access, is very much currently functioning as a healthy early access game.\n\nThe game has some areas of 'needs improvement' - but I am a very picky player who already knows a great deal about real life ecology.  It's one of the very best ecology simulators I have sampled, and they're working to make it better.\n\nIt is not a game for players who demand fast paced time controlled action, this is very much a game where you make strategic choices and allow time to pass to see the outcome.  I consider this game to be more of an idle clicker sort of game than any other sort of game mechanic, and a player can expect many minutes to hours of real life to pass before one sees the overall outcome of choices made.  But a player is allowed multiple simultaneous biomes, and the choice to allow time to pass while each is offline or not - note this is not a way to speed up time in the game.  One can allow up to a maximum of 3 months of simulated time to pass while logged out, but logging out is not a way to snap time progression forward.\n\nDespite this, the game is detailed and engaging, in a 'spread out over many, many days of play' sort of way.  Additionally, it appears to be in -very- active development, with player opinions getting significant amounts of developer interaction and discussion.\n\nGreat team, top game of its type, and getting better.  I like this game and these people.  I think you will too.","April 20","true","4.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

My children love the game and have both managed to create seemingly stable eco systems (They don't play on hard like I do and so far I've had trouble creating a truely stable eco system so at least the game is challenging for parents and children) I would like to see the creatures interact, like a coyote taking down a rabbit or cougar taking down a mule deer for the most part animals just seem to ignore each other.\n\nFrom a gameplay point of view the game does not offer enough information that actually applies to the game. The biodex offers real life information and often includes items that aren't even in the game as predator/prey relationships. I would love to see a biodex that actually comes out and says exactly what each animal eats and gives more game realted detail as far as how they impact the game world . So far we're left guessing exactly how many of each thing we need, will this animal eat this plant and if so will it actually like it? It seems like when I place down anything it literally interacts with everything else but that doesn't really tell me HOW they interact, is it going to eat it or is it going to hide in it or is it going to trip over it what is going on? How does a tourtise interact with a coyote are they going to fight or what? This has lead to me just putting down everything plant and animal wise and seeing what survives in a survival of the fittest sort of scenario which I guess is true to life : P\n\nOne other thing I'd really love to see is some sort of history as to what happened while you were away 3 months. I come back and all animals in my biome are dead other than insects it would be nice to see how or why certain creatures are no longer around. I'm left guesing, did the carinvores eat all the herbivores then starve or did the herbivores survive then over populate and starve death or what? There are no bodies, no evidence, but surely a research assistant was around watching this happen can't I get some kind of report on what is going on while I'm away?\n\nI think the game has a lot of room to improve and I hope the developers continue to do so, as it stands it seems more like an early access game than a full title. Perhaps developers can open up the game to modding and allow them to be hosted on Steam, then players can add their own animals and improve sound effects and graphics, works for Skyrim why not Tyto Ecology  ? :  )","April 30","true","6.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","5"

Unlike some other spawns the mushrooms appear randomly around the biome within the spawn radius.\nA good veriety of creatures and plants etc.\nCamera is better after 1.6 update.\n\n\nCon's :\nStatic spawns such as butterflies. I guess it would be very resource intensive to have hundreds of individual butterflies but the current alernative seems to be a small cloud that just stay it the spawn point.\nPoor AI. I find it annoying to place some plants and herbivores and then a single carnivore and then sit and watch as the carnivore strolls around the group of prey and they dont respond at all. Shouldnt they try to hide in vegitation or at least try to move away from the predator?\nWater looks terrible even on the highest setting. Its like a slightly animated oily mirror.\n\nLastly and this is just my personel preference but the pace is just so slow with little to keep me interested. I want to like the game but i get bored very quickly. Dont assume i dont have patience either... I just stopped playing a virtual cactus growing game!\n\nFor me it needs a lot more to keep me interested. Maybe more stats and data on your biomes and inhabitants. Better AI would make the interactions between creatures more interesting. Maybe speed up the ability to unlock more stuff early on to add more variety. I like that you need to work for progression but early game its to slow to keep me interested.\n\nSo in summary, i looked again after the 1.6 update and although the camera control is a big improvement i'm sorry to say i still cant recommend this game as it just isnt something i want to play yet.\n\nI will look at the game again after more updates.\n\n\n[Old Review]\n\nI didnt like it. I usually love this type of game but this just left me feeling very bored and disappointed. Graphics are pretty poor and need more and smoother animations. Gameplay isnt there yet either as you place a few plants and then plant eaters and throw in a carnivore or 2 and then sit back and wait.... and wait.... and wait... and ok i'm bored. Yes the foxes eat the rabbits and the rabbits eat the plants and the insects/worms do the biodegradable what not but what do i do... its boring...\n\nSorry not for me.","May 26","false","2.0"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","26","43","0","9"

If you liked Zoo Tycoon, Sim Park, or any of those other old wildlife simulation titles... be prepared for a bit of a nostalgia trip.\n\nThe gameplay is failry straightforward. you start with an empty biodome. At present, there are three to choose from- Desert, Grassland, and Rainforest. The Desert biodome is based on the American Mojave Desert (for those FO: NV fans reading this, NO there is not an option to include radioactive mutated wildlife), and the Grasland biodome is based on the Great Plains of the United States. The Rainforest biodome, in contrast, is based on the Amazon rainforest of South america.\n\nOnce you choose a Biodome to work with- and you can have multiple biodomes at once- it is your job to create a functioning ecosystem. Word of advice- start by unlocking as many plants as you can first, as you start with a pollinator and there is no way to "make space" for new plants later on. Also, it will make keeping you dome healthy easier in both the short and long run. Reproduction is handled simply but realisticly, in the sense that while there are no mating animations, the time periods and litters are scaled to their real-world time periods as much as possible. This, combined with the lack of gore, makes the game very kid friendly and educational. A predator will kill prey by simply running up to them and delivering a quick bite. No blood is involved.\n\nImportantly, you only start with a single section of your biodome available for use; you must unlock the other areas through use of ingame "tyto tokens" which are earned at the end of every ingame week. You CANNOT purchase these coins- you must earn them, and the number of coins you earn is based on the health and biodiversity of your biodome. There is no pay to win feature here. Incidentally, these coins are also how you unlock new species to place in your biodome. Also important to note, animal territories that extend into another section of the biodome can and will take resources from the section they extend into. Place your territories carefully.\n\nOther than these tips, I will leave you to discover the fun by yourself. The game is fun and relaxing, and can be enjoyed at your own pace. The developers are VERY interactive with their community, and problems are answered propmtly and quickly. One quick thing- "Tyto" happens to be the genus name for Tyto alba, the barn owl. The game is called Tyto Ecology, and your inagme avatar is a cute little robot called the owlbot.

I enjoyed the peaceful pace the game has, but you can also increase the speed a little (energy accumulates very slow). Plantlife also expands on their own on-game and off-game, as well as the inhabitants in the animal territories decrease or increase (you have to carefully plan not to have too many carnivores in a zone, or too few insects for insectivores etc).

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Tyto Ecology is an educational life simulation.\n\nYou control an 'owlbot' (I have no idea ...) with which you're able to move around inside your chosen biodome (or 'biome'), interacting simply by placing habitat markers for various insects, plants, and animals. Then you sit back and watch the artificial life unfold, placing more objects as desired in an effort to help, or hinder, your biodome's life.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are okay, leaning towards poor. Stiffly animated and seemingly low-poly models combine with very flat-looking textures to create scenery like that seen in a 15-20-year-old RPG, where nothing really seems to interact with the world. Some of the individual models look okay by themselves, particularly the plants, but taken together they just don't seem to fit right. Water doesn't look anything like water -- it's a solid blue polygon upon which animals can walk -- and there are no fancy graphical effects, except for some shadows. Even with settings turned all the way up the graphics are fairly unimpressive.\n\nThere is a certain charm to the creatures, though, and some of the plants individually are quite nice, but placement of them invariably leaves them looking stuck on to the very flat-looking ground surface. You're also unable to overlap different vegetation on the ground, leading to an extremely sparse rainforest environment, for example.\n\nSound - Sound is minimal. There's some weird music that is hard to hear, interrupted sporadically by piercingly loud noises from some of the mammals. I think a bit of volume normalisation may be in order.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay itself is very simple. You move your weird owlbot thingy about with WASD, and use the mouse to look around, zoom in and out, and interact with your biodome.\n\nThe biodome itself starts out empty; you populate it with various producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (mushrooms, insects). You don't control any of these yourself, though. Instead you spend some of one or the other of the two in-game currencies (both earned over time, and also through reaching achievements) to purchase a marker for your desired object, which you then place in the world. Some of these (e.g. trees) simply allow you to place the one object and be done with it. Others (e.g. tortoises) allow you to place the marker, from which a host of creatures then spawns within the designated territory.\n\nThe key to what Tyto offers is what happens next: the interaction between the game objects you've placed. Consumers require something to survive: either producers or other consumers. They then produce detritus, which builds up in the biodome unless you add decomposers to process it, thus providing extra food for the producers. It's a simple cycle, but given that you don't have any direct control over any of the creatures in your biodome, the interactions between all of the components is quite interesting.\n\nTyto offers three biodome habitat types, with some overlapping flora and fauna between them: tropical rainforest, grasslands, and desert. It also offers between 2 and 20 of each of the producers, consumers, and decomposers per biodome type, but most of these overlap across two or three of the habitats, so the range of choices isn't as large as it first sounds. You can create multiple biodomes of each type and experiment as you desire; other than the tutorial and achievements, goals are only what you make them.\n\nThe game also provides an in-game encyclopaedia of sorts, called the 'biodex'. This is both useful for the game itself, and also an educational resource for someone interested in learning more about some of the insects, plants, and animals featured in Tyto.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Mostly very well written text; the 'biodex' encyclopaedia thingy is fantastic!\n+ Educational\n+ Achievements to promote some goals and replayability\n+ Developers are very active in the Community Hub and are willing to participate in useful discussions\n+ Simple ideas lead to interesting and complex interactions; it's easy to play, but hard to 'master'\n+ It's great to see another artificial life simulator on the market; I haven't played one for ages\n\nCons:\n- Graphics are relatively poor\n- Sounds and music are minimal, and very out-of-balance as far as volume levels are concerned\n- A very limited range of plants and creatures means that it all gets a bit boring after a while\n- Some of the achievements are just silly (200 years!)\n- No flying or swimming creatures, even though birds and bats are mentioned in a few places in the biodex\n- No overlapping plants, and no way to delete or move them after you've placed them, leading to the least forest-like rainforest I've ever seen\n- Movement controls stop working when you're placing objects, leading to some annoying place-cancel-rotate-cancel-rotate-place type scenarios (coupled with the above for extra frustration!)\n- Sometimes creatures just seem to die off, even when you've accounted for all of their needs\n- No simulation of weather, seasons, wind, etc. (I know, it's a biodome simulation, but even a simple biodome would at least have some rain from the watering systems!)\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================Tyto Ecology is certainly not for everyone. It's an artificial life simulation that is very slow, and sometimes even boring. The graphics are disappointing, and the sound is probably better left off. And the developers made some weird decisions that make your biodomes look very sparsely populated even when they're 'full'. But it's also interesting, and fun at times, and even a little bit rewarding sometimes.\n\nFor what it tries to be, Tyto does a reasonable job. I hope the developers stick with it and address some of the problems, and also release more content.\n\n6/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","April 23","true","3.8"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

It also happens to be rather enjoyable.\n\nThe players job is to place plants and animals so that they don't all die a terrible death. This happens to be more complex then you would think (unless you happen to be an ecologist. Then it's about as complex as you would think). It's all about getting the right ratios. As you build your ecosystem you get coins that allow you to purchase new types of plants and animals to add (i.e. use to destroy) to your ecosystem.\n\nThe gameplay takes a while to play out. An in game day is maybe (educated guess) ten minutes sped up. However, the game does continue when you turn the game off. your ecosystem will continue to flourish (fat chance) when you leave. You can set the maximum amount of time that is allowed to pass between play sessions, and that acts to decide the difficulty of the game.\n\nOverall, I've really enjoyed Tyto Ecology so far. I've slaughtered healthy Jackrabbit populations with Bobcats and then slaughtered the Bobcats in the name of balancing the ecosystem. For some reason I feel rather evil... well, it's all in the name of progress. If you like slow paced simulations, or enjoy watching ant farms (this game is like a massive, far more interesting ant farm), then check this game out. It'll be right up your alley.","April 15","true","2.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

I also like the type of game that plays while youre away, as it is a good way to occupy your mind while still doing constructive things (IE: It doesnt feel as boring to do the dishes, if you know your ecosystem is doing its stuff aswell).\nWhat kept me in the game was, after working through the tutorial and the beginning, which felt quite slow, i ended up having fun trying to properly integrate predators into my ecosystem and trying to find the balance between herbivores, plants and detritus. The animations can be abit lackluster, but as far as i understand from reading other threads on this forum, this game is still being worked on?\n\nThe biodex is fantastic. It gives you alot of infomation of which you have to find out what applies in your ecosystem and what doesnt. It feels alot like a helpful handbook, which you also end up learning from.\nIt also complements just watching the animals behaviour, as to learn what they tend to eat and do, in your specific ecosystem.\n\nIt took me about 5 hours to unlock everything for the jungle biome, withouth integrating any predators yet, and there are 4 biomes, so thats roughly 20 hours of straight up progression before youve seen it all, and again, thats without having gotten anything good to actually work yet.","June 6","true","9.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I can appreciate the content and depth.\n\nWhat I did not care for:\n\n-The tutorial is vague, for once I would of prefered a bit more.\n-The camera movement was annoying - either eye level or zoomed out to the point things are markers. Personally want a middle ground.\n- I expect nature to look more than "ok". I rarely care about graphics and usually prefer depth but given the topic it's very lack luster. I didn't feel immersed in the experience like I'd hoped.\n-Lack of animation, my jackrabbits hop or lay on their sides with "Zzzz" to indicate sleeping. I want to see animals 'do their thing' day to day and night to night.\n-Agree with another reviewer, sound lacking, I don't like game music much... I want ambience. Wind, bird chipping, whatever else that is suitable.\n\nWhat worked:\n\nContent for bios is very good, I found the vegatation and animals to choose from rather good.\nAnimal and plant information is good - enough to inform but not bore you to tears.\nThe dev's ARE very active with the game and their community.\nThe price is too low if anything, you do get your money's worth.\nUpdates are coming for some of the issues I had.\n\n\nI've changed my mind and will recommend the game.

At first I hated the unlock system, because I just wanted to play around with all the things. Coming back the next day to 100 coins per dome (a massive amount) and a completly dead animal population I am very happy with the unlock system, as it lets you learn the basics of how an ecosystem runs before creating anything massive. Hopefully I have adjusted and learned from my mistakes. The only improvments I would ask for in this game is even more biomes, and animal/plant choices (some actuall species instead of common names such as frog would be nice).

There's a few things that definitely need improvement, but that comes with most new games and from my understanding it's only a small group of developers who've created this game. From going through the posts in the community, it's obvious the developers are active and listening to the players problems and suggestions, and I highly look forward to how the game expands and improves with each new update.\n\nThe game itself is nice. The graphics aren't amazing, but it doesn't affect the gameplay in any way. It forces the player to watch the numbers of species and really think about their next move, which I enjoy. The tutorial also doesn't leave you guessing like I've found with numerous other games; It introduced the herbivores, carnivores, producers and decomposers in a way every player can understand, and leaves you to go from there. I also liked the inclusion of the Biodex, however it would be nice if some of the information was quickly and easily accessible when selecting a new species to introduce.\n\nMy only real issue with the game is performance. It runs relatively smoothly until I begin introducing more species/plants, then the music becomes glitchy and the game starts to lag. From what I've read so far, these performance issues are being looked into so I don't think it's a reason to be put off the game, as it's got a pretty low price in the first place.\n\nOverall, I believe this game has massive potential. It's a great idea, which offers education and fun for a wide range of age groups. I'm sure the game will progress and improve, and I look forward to any new features the developers choose to add. If you like animals, education, strategy or just a generally relaxed game, this is for you. I'd also highly recommend it for parents with children who like animals and are interested in them. It's not too hard to get the grasp of and I'm sure they'd benefit highly from the educational aspects of the game.\n","April 15","true","2.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

So, i quarrel with myself, whether i should recommend and promote or rate and demand. :/","April 15","false","1.3"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","4"

I do think it needs a few important animals added for example "Birds" which not only help control the population of some animals, can spread seeds of plants.  Also the ultimate animal should be human, and to see if we are able to balance that is the ultimate goal.  I think as for biodomes needed to be added could be "Ocean", "Forrest", "Everglades - Swamps" and any animal that would fit within those realms.  All in all its a great game, and if they do keep adding to it might make it into a really good teaching tool for those trying to teach the new generations our place in the world cycle.","April 17","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Can't wait to see where it goes from here! You get three biomes to choose from and a lovely roster of animals to put into your own little world. Make the world your way, just watch out for that darn Detritus.\n\n:::LONGISH REVIEW/STORY TIME:::\nWhen I was a kid, I loved the games of Zoo tycoon, Wildlife Park and JPOG, they let you basically control animals albeit from the point of a Zoo Manager until inevitabley getting bored setting all the carnivores lose and become a mass murderer..Firstly, you can do this in this game except its setting carnivores on the peaceful well..everything that moves! However Zoo games have got a bit repetitive and are a rare thing to find now a days,  but it always sprung the question "Man wouldn't it be cool to be God and just make animals and ecosystems how you wanted without having to worry about fences, park fees or stupid customers?"\n\nWell if so you're in luck, this game lets do you just that and can I say this game is amazing but...being "God" sucks (In the best way, creating stuff is fun, but keeping everything from going into a ♥♥♥♥♥torm is difficult). This game has a charm about it that makes you want to keep trying, sure, it can be repetitive to some and thats fine but to me this game is full of little things that make me want to keep playing. This is GREAT for anyone studying biology, not everyone is well versed in Ecosystems etc so this game has tonnes of information about all different life forms and their uses. I personally would say if teachers used this in school, it would make Biology super fun to learn! It has endless posibilities regarding more biomes, more animals and more plants and it doesn't cost that much at all and its definitely worth the price. If you catch it on sale its a bargain!\n\n\nHow to some up the different groups in this game and my experiences with them.\nMe: Hi all of my fabulous creations.\nCarnivores: Almighty Albatross, our day has been most bountyful, praise be upon you.\nHerbivores: -flips the bird-\nOmnivores: -flips the bird-\nInsectivores: -flips the bird-\nFish: -Flips the bird-\nWorms: MUST EAT FOR THE PRECIOUS. PRECIOUS IS MINE. PRECIOUSSSSSS.\nMushrooms: -Half smiles, gives a faint flipping of said bird.-\nPlants: -Grow branches that make the shape of flipping the bird but smile as they do so seeing carnivores wipe everything out-\nDetritus: My name is Detritus Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die﻿...what was that? You havent done anything to me? Lol, still..time to cause you to flip your ♥♥♥♥ every 20 minutes and ruin your day.\n-sighs as I have to add more Gollum Worms and send them into battle as I notice carnivores destroying everything-\nMe: Um..guys?\nCarnivores: Yes our beloved Almighty?\nMe: The ♥♥♥♥ guys?\nCarnivores: What dude?\nMe: What are you doing?\nCarnivores: Nothing.\nMe: Whats that behind your back?\nCarnivores: Oh um...most of your other creations crying out for help.\nMe: For the love of..are you guys serious?\nCarnivores: Its just a prank bro..\nMe: Well can you not?\nCarnivores: -flips the bird-\n\n\n\nGet.This.Game.\n...also if possible add birds love you long time.","April 19","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","11"

I could see this being very educational for an elementary school aged child who likes nature.  Building an ecosystem could be a good family project.\n\nOn the down side, the graphics and animations are very basic. The slow evolution of the ecosystem is relaxing, but if you are the type person who likes lots of action it can become boring because there are long stretches when you just watch the animals move about.\n\nOverall, I think it is well worth the price, and  a nice change of pace.","April 15","true","3.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I have to say if you do not have patience for a game that takes you through everyday of life in you habitat then this game might not be recommended for you. But if you are interested...\n\nYou might look forward to this game.\nRemember when i said that this game was like Zoo Tycoon i mean that it is exactly like it. now if you don't know what i'm talking about then i explain how fun both of them are at the same time. These games both give you your own world to control and your own animals, problems, and solutions. I'd have to say that these two games are a little bit different in difficulty. Tyto Ecology gives you more of a challenge them Zoo Tycoon(my opinion). In Zoo Tycoon you control a zoo and manage it so animals are seperated and humans are having fun and of coarse the finacail part of it. While Tyto Ecology is more open world and there is hardly any sepertation of animals just the food chain to follow and use to keep your place happy. It's cool in Tyto Ecology that you get to unlock more zones for more space by earning a currency to purchase stuff and it really one play through can get you through a year of time or more!\n\n10/10 would play this game over and over again!","April 23","true","15.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","4"

For things to reproduce,it can take from 50-369 days. While predators eat every about 3 minutes when sped up.(one day sped up is about 30 secs?)\n4.My yellow foot turtles eat like they are starving,and my Bobcats don't seem to want to eat them. Also,a Cougar would rather eat a mouse than a Antelope. So in short,the AI is not exactly the best.(but again,new game)\n5.Lastely,not enough Dodos.\n\nThe Devs are really great and this game is quite addicting once you start along with it being cheapish.

It's not very buggy as I know, but the textures aren't very smooth, and gameplay is slow, timewise. It takes forever to progress, and the fact that you have to unlock certain animals is kind of deterring.\n\nPROS: VERY good idea. It has potential to be a very fun game, both for the purpose of messing up an ecosystem or legit trying to make one.\nNice GUI and overall appeal was good\nIt was a good effort. I would probably play this game if it were better.\nCONS: SLOW GAMEPLAY. Although you can fast-forward, you still have to wait a long time before anything can reproduce and move on gameplay. This is mainly what pushed me away.\nSmall area in which to work. So, you get the coin thingys at the end of each week, and that takes about 0.4 hours, cuz I only spent 13 in-game days on it, so... Anyways, it costs 50 coins to unlock area 2, and there are 5 areas. You get 10 coins a week or so. THAT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME FOR GRINDING A MEDIOCRE GAME. It's not really worth the time and effort.\nYou have to wait to unlock certain animals, plants, and decomposers. They cost coins, so basically for a while you only get the bobcat, jackrabbit, shrooms, that one plant, and a moth. BORING. So yeah, needs more animals to be able to use.\nOVERALL: 4/10. I wouldn't reccomend spending money on this game, as it isn't worth it. Rather than buy this, buy Spore by MAXIS and EA. It's the same, exept you can create a character, make a tribe, create an empire with sick military jets, tanks, and boats, then create a spaceship and conquer the universe. And the first two stages+ space stage is centered around creating/stabilizing/surviving in an ecostystem. 10x better, and worth the money.

The beginning of the game seems easy. The difficulty will probably come once you have unlocked the whole dome (playable area) and filled it with all sorts of animals etc.\n\nI do like the music in this game. Although there doesn't seem to be a big variety in different background tracks (2-3?) they fit the game very well, are relaxing and don't feel like being forced onto you. The tracks remind me a bit of the tracks from Simcity 4 and City Skylines.\n\nHowever there are 2 downsides I would like to mention at the moment. There is little to no sound effects. Only when you click on an animal it will make it's distinctive sound and obviously normal mouseclicks on the interface make a sound. Other than that, you only hear the music playing.\n\nThe animations and AI seem a bit strange at times. Sometimes you do see bobcats hunting and killing rabbits for example. But sometimes their hunger bar just fills while they are standing moveless at the border of the dome.\n\nOverall and due to a lack of alternatives, I would say the game is definitely worth the little price it costs.\n\n","April 14","true","4.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Your life will interact amongst themselves and eventually reproduce. This is why predators are key to the success of an ecosystem, as the herbivores would overpopulate if there were no predators. That would be a problem because every animal in the game must eat, besides (to my knowledge) the insects, such as the blue morpho in the rainforest biome and the ant in the plains. You unlock different parts of the biodome eventually throughout the course of its life, each expansion costing more. But with each expansion comes a brand new canvas for you to populate.

While some of this is covered in the brief tutorial, it would have been a nice feature to include especially as the game is probably marketed to a young demographic.\n\nA lack of transparency regarding the statistics of your biome was dissapointing. Again, some of this was accessible by manually clicking through each population however it would have been nice to have some sort of central overview of the correlation between all components of your ecosystem. I found myself wondering what aspects of my biome were causing decreases and increases to my biodiversity, so some sort of indication as to the source of these fluctuations would have been welcome.\n\nVisually I was actually impressed. While the graphics certainly would not win any awards I can see that a reasonable effort has gone into art and animation, which could likewise have been easily overlooked in such a title. An inability to remap controls was disappointing.\n\nUnfortunately the fun factor here was minimal at best. There was no real incentive to do anything, other than to keep your biome health up. I really liked that a comprehensive database of information regarding each component was included, much like how Age of Empires and the Civilisation series have consistently included in-depth information, but when there's no actual fun to be had alongside this feature you may as well just read a book on the subject.\n\nOverall I would recommend this to someone who has absolutely no concept of the basics of biodiversity as an extremely basic educational tool. I feel bad giving this a negative review because I really support education in interactive media but there are a number of areas where this game falls short. I guess I can buy my guilt off knowing I paid for the title and supported the developer in some small way.","April 20","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","8"

However, you are limited in how much you can do with the creatures and biomes; like you cannot shape the terrain nor can you give commands to anything to do something. You are just trying to maintain a balanced eco-system as you fill up the map. That is, if you were able to do that…at all.\n\nThe game has a cool idea, but it is hard for me to even call it a game at all. With about 19 hours of gameplay, I was only involved with maybe 5 hours; a few of which I forced myself to play just for this review. The first few hours are fun to mess around with stuff and watch your biome burn from a lack of understanding, but even after reading through the only information given in a form of an index (which I assume is accurate scientific data for the biomes and etc.) you will still be scratching your head wondering why your biome cannot maintain itself except past a certain point. Which becomes a common theme. And it doesn't help that the majority of your time in Tyto Ecology will be spent just waiting…and waiting…and waiting….and waiting…for something to happen.\n\nThe game is still un-optimized and contains bugs that will lower your framerate to a slug’s pace (even on my $5000.00 pc), making it un-playable. It has many of the drawbacks of a mobile game where you feel like a lot of decisions for the pace and mechanics of the game were made in the thought of micro-transactions (there are not micro-transactions on PC).\n\nThere also isn’t enough information for the player, like given in Sim City or City Skylines, for you to digest or to understand (mechanical information) and even when your waiting for “x” to happen, there is nothing for the player to do (besides reading all the scientific facts of the creatures and plants).\n\nThere is also a lot of annoying features and tools that should be in the game, but are missing; like being able to rotate and move the camera while placing objects or being able to rotate larger objects, like trees, a certain way.  It just isn’t fun to play after the initial look, you will find yourself doing other things the majority of the time while this is alt+tabbed in the background.\n\nThe developers have been extremely active which is great and makes it more painful for me to say, but this game is not worth $5.00 and you should only really play Tyto Ecology if you’re the type of person who enjoys playing a game, or multiple games, periodically throughout your day.\n\n\n[04/16/2016] - Initial Entry\nBefore I give the game a proper review, I currently cannot recommend this title as there are some game breaking bugs that either make it unplayable or very frustrating to play. I will revise this review as updates come out.","April 16","false","19.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","18"

It operates on a "high school" model of ecology, but it would be damn near impossible for a game like this to get any more complex than that. I'm glad to see that the developers seem to actually care, and listen to their community.

I just hope the devs will keep working on it, and some kind of genetics system and more 'randomness' would be awesome.\n\nAlso maybe another game mode where let's say you can only impact basic things like the terrain itself, average temperature,.... and see what happens.","April 14","true","0.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
