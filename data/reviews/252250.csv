Ignore the steam playtime; I bought this outside of steam at 0.3x.\n\nIt's not often I write a negative review, especially of early access games - either it's too soon to tell, or the game is so bad that Jim Sterling will deal with it.  Maia, though, I want to warn people off, for now.\n\nMaia should not be in early access at this time, and it certainly should not have a ticket price of $25.  This is an alpha stage game, with serious, fundamental flaws that need to be worked on before this can be an enjoyable beta experience.\n\nMaia is a colony builder, like Spacebase DF9 or Rimworld.  It takes the Towns approach of letting you set tasks and build spaces but not directly control the colonists.  With good AI and balanced priorities this works well; without it, you get issues as with Towns.  Maia is somewhere in between: the AI isn't very good, but there is so little going on in the gameworld that it's just about good enough, unless you do something weird.\n\nGraphically I like Maia.  It's got a 1980s styrofoam-and-foil aesthetic, with big-head robots and Space: 1999 jumpsuits.  The graphics are very unpolished, but this game I think qualifies as alpha at this stage, so that will come.\n\nThe UI is just so bad.  It is clunky, awkward to use, with unintuitive keybindings, an absence of necessary information in the overlay, no easy way to check what your colonists are doing, and an annoying over-sensitivity to screen scrolling when you're trying to get the obnoxious and imprecise mouse cursor over the icons.  Drawing rooms is a chore, which is an issue when that is pretty much the only thing you can currently do in the game.\n\nIt's also very poorly optimised.  Running on min settings, with a mid-range computer in excess of the recommended specs, I get memory crashes, terrible frame rate issues, and periodic freezing as the game tries to calculate something.  I've spent a lot of time on forums trying to find ways to address these issues at my end, with no luck; I'm not the only person with this experience.  A certain level of poor optimisation is to be expected with early access, but not to the degree where it derails your playing.\n\nDevelopment is okay.  I feel like they should be further along than they are at this point.  For over a half a million dollars in funding and a year and a half since the first playable build, it should be further along than this.  I think Maia, Towns, DF9 et al illustrate one central truth about town-management games: they take time to develop.  If you over-promise, you get DF9; if you rush and then run out of hype, you get Folk Tale; if you don't nail the AI, you get Towns.  Dwarf Fortress didn't happen overnight; without having to worry about graphics or platform integration that game took years to get to anything like a quality gaming experience.\n\nAnd that's principally why I am warning against Maia.  For a well-funded game to be charging $25 for an early access build that isn't optimised, isn't visually polished, doesn't have basic features, lacks solid AI, and is without the diversity of content you need for a game in this genre, that's not a good investment.  I accept that an early access game will be content-light, will have areas needing to be polished, but when a colony-manager after this much work still doesn't have basic UI, AI and optimisation sorted out, they are going to have no chance of adding more content without bringing the game crashing down.\n\nI want this game to succeed, but they don't need more money, and you don't need the current experience of Maia.  Give them until the end of the year, see where they're at then; they will either have fixed these issues by overhauling basically the core of the game, or it will have gone the way of Folk Tale.  Either way you'll have your answer.","April 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 141 of 176 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","141","176","0","9"

I regret Maia more than any other useless, unplayable purchase in the dark history of Early Access. Maia is absolutely beneath what's acceptable to release as an EA game. It does not even meet the minimum bar of quality for paid alphas.\n\nAs of this updated review, you're still paying for an extremely limited demo sandbox where you can place objects and watch animations happen. The setting can't decide whether it wants to be a realistic simulator (vital statistics on each colonist, food/water/atmosphere required for survival) or a complete joke (giant fuzzy extraterrestrial life).\n\nUser interface design is not good, and it's difficult to tell what each control does. The current main controls for Maia are a series of badly documented hotkeys. One of the only good new features: you can skip the tutorial now.\n\nBut if you take one thing away from this review: the bugs are show-stoppingly bad. I've experienced sudden framerate slowdowns on both Mac and PC, as well as crashes-to-desktop for no discernable reason. The colonist and robot AI will get stuck in walls or stand next to piles of rubble on no notice. There appears to be very little QA before each release, and minimal progress in fixing the crash bugs since I wrote my last review in 2013 December.\n\nJune 2015 Update: It still sucks. I'm not even going to sugar-coat this. It crashes and freezes even more than it did last year, and there's still no resource management or objectives to speak of. They literally just added more framerate-drop-inducing wildlife.\n\nMaia isn't worth paying for and probably never will be. I used to think something good might come of it eventually, but after more than a year and a half I've lost all hope.","December 6, 2013","false","5.2"," 178 of 235 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","178","235","0","14"

It could be that (judging by the progress speed that makes continental drift seem fast) in half a decade it will evolve into the most amazing colony sim ever. Or not. Who knows?\n\nBut at the moment, it's NOT a good use of your money. As was said, it pushes the limit of what is acceptable to release as "early access". It's just a bare-bones graphics engine, with some minimal and BROKEN animations, a non-functional AI, and no save and reload either, so your progress WILL be lost each time you exit.\n\nAnd by "non-functional AI" I don't mean "might not prioritize right", but as in "doesn't even work, or not for long." Colonist AI routinely craps itself and either stops building anything any more (lucky version) or you just get a colonist going catatonic in the airlock and never moving any more (more usual version.) And when you do get it to work for half an hour, it will prioritize the hilariously wrong thing, like everyone keeping repairing the doors instead of building the air purifier.\n\nNow that might be palatable (not really) in a game where you can direct them around, like in The Sims, and the AI only keeps them alive in between. But here you can't direct them, and the WHOLE premise is that they do their own thing, a broken AI just means a broken game.\n\nEtc.\n\nReally, it has no excuse to be released at this early and dysfunctional stage. It may eventually be worth playing. Save your money for then.\n\nUpdate for 0.44:\n\nUpon starting the game, I proceeded to place the workshop and dig a small tunnel to one side, and a 4x4 tile hole there. Partially because you NEED minerals, and partially because I needed somewhere to place the hydroponics bay. I must stress that I wasn't digging some grand ballroom hall, and I was mindful that it has plenty of all rock walls on all sides, because I did read the update notes about earthquakes. When that was about half-way dug, the ceiling promptly collapsed, squashing the only digger robot and two of four colonists, who were there to take minerals.\n\nSo basically, instead of fixing the existing problems, it just added a random "*BANG* you're dead!" event, the hallmark of incompetent game design. Yippee.\n\nWell, regardless of how you personally feel about that kind of events, to my mind it just further illustrated the point of why shouldn't you buy a game that's not even in alpha yet: you don't know what you're going to get for your money. The kind of gameplay elements that the final mix will have can just as well be what you like, or what you hate, and there's no way to know which it will be, as there doesn't even seem to be any plan.","May 28, 2014","false","8.8"," 127 of 164 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","127","164","0","7"

I bought it around 0.47 because it looked so good on paper but here is why you actually shouldn't get it in my opinion, at least in its current state:\n\n- the updates have been increasingly rare\n- the updates that it does get add new functionality that seems random while it doesn't improve the (lack of ) core game play\n- there is no sense in the game of what you are supposed to be doing - e.g. how much material / food / colonists in total you have. They just added reports on power which is great, but every game like this has an overview window that shows you your resources so that you know what you need to be getting next. That, to me, seems more important than adding weapons, for instance.\n- there is no sense of why accidents happen - e.g. all my atmosphere generators exploded all at once - I have no idea why! And the colonists don't seem to care, they just walk around. You would expect major panic if something like this happened in the real life (the game is supposed to be a simulation, right?)\n\nBefore you all start accusing me of not knowing what alpha is - I know very well. I'm a dev myself.\n\nIn my opinion, the devs here should stop adding more functionality that create more breadth and isntead focus on improving the gamer's experience to create depth. Make a game out of this. Because at the moment, it seems like bunch of functionality stitched together. Give us a reason to play! Experimenting with new features is great, but wears off after you've built everything. The game is not interesting after that.

The weather effects are awesome. That being said, I have purchase several games in alpha and beta stages. I have been in invite-only beta tests also. I know what to expect and what not to expect from games in early stages, and this one is terrible. The developer clearly has little idea of what he's doing from a procedural point of view. In the time i've owned this game here's what's happened: several patches have been released, but the big problems haven't been resolved... neat new little content has been added, but with the game unplayable it makes little difference. This game is sure to disappoint over and over again. I waited so long to write this review because I wanted to see if some progress would be made, but it hasn't. The worst part of it is that the developer has had to go off steam (on kickstarter) to continue to raise money. Please save yourself the headache of downloading this game. If you do try to play, here are a few tips.\n1) Save often. F5 saves and F9 loads... the icons at the top right also save and load, i'll let you try to figure out which is which\n2) The AI is always getting stuck in stupid loops or just shutting down. This happens every few minutes like clockwork... you must save, exit the game, and restart it to continue playing.\n3) Things don't update like they should... if you mine ore but can't figure out why it isn't being moved to storage... it's probably AI to blame again... another reload should help.\n4) Sometimes things stop working inexplicably, If the airlock breaks and cannot be repaired, you must start a new game. some things can be repaired though, so who knows.\n5) Always place two doors on rooms... if the door breaks and needs repair, but your people are inside of the room, and the guys outside the room are too tired to do it and the door that's broken leads to the sleeping area... they might decide not to repair it and instead die from lack of sleep... leaving the others trapped inside to starve\n6) Just get in the habit of restarting the game every few minutes\n7) Don't bother with research, it causes bugs which basically cause the game to crash beyond a certain point... meaning you'll never get past that point without starting yet another new game.\n8) Use windows 7 or vista, and make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card (and by that I mean have a graphics card that uses newer drivers) The dev doesn't like helping with bugfixing if your computer doesn't use the latest drivers, despite the fact that some older cards (like the ones in my windows 7 machine) have old drivers (even if they are the "most up to date" they are still like 2 years old) and that still others (like on my windows 8 acer machine) require the use of special drivers provided by the OEM which may not be the "latest and greatest".\n9) Don't expect too much, this way you won't be disappointed.\n\nEdit: still... don't buy this game. It's on sale, but seriously... you wouldn't play it more than 30 minutes, even if it were free.\n\nUPDATE: 21 May 2015... I'm not sure how it's even possible, but the game is even worse now than it was before.","November 28, 2014","false","9.3"," 100 of 133 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","100","133","0","7"

(The rain kinda is wanked, but that is with most games that are top down) The concept is, in my opinion, one of the best parts of the game and I'd love to see it reach its goal. Making it into the game a few hours, I finally built a lab and was able to start doing research, though it doesn't lead to anything yet. But based on the reserach that I completed and finished, it seems that the goal it to eventually get a tech tree of some sort into the game which would increase the time to "finish" the game and also increase replayability.\n\nSo, since this is a great concept and it seems to be on its way, what is the problem? I personaly feel like I don't know if it will ever get to its goal and dream. I've seen so many early access games come and go and never get fully finished. Like I said, the concept is great, but with a UI that needs work, menus that are slightly confusing and an AI that really doesn't seem to know what it is doing, I just don't know. Hopefully I'll get proved wrong.\n\nSo, breaking down the issues with the game I'll start with the UI. The UI doesn't provide enough information at a glance. It is slightly cumbersome and it provides so few functions in general. As for the menus I'll just give a few examples; the load and save buttons aren't in the "esc" menu but are buttons in the upper right of your screen... ok, not bad sounding... but they aren't labeled so I lost a two hour base because I hit the "load" and not "save" icon. Another example of the UI needing work is the building menu. To switch between items as of now, one has to press "Q" and "E" a design choice I personally don't get. And that latter brings me into my last point or the AI being wonky. I can get around most of the other issues, but the AI is my biggest gripe right now. I can't tell my colonists what to do by say clicking on them and then clicking on a task I want the to complete. In some cases, this can lead to many deaths. I can set up many tasks, with the first thing I tried to build being a heater, and they'll do other things first, and die from hypothermia. lol. I mean, if I'm freezing to death, I'll build a heater first. But, IDK, maybe they know more than me.\n\nSo, in the end I'm going to recommend this game with a caution. Beware of what you are getting. It is, as I said, a great concept and I think that all the negative reviews don't do it quite justice and I want to see this succeed as I miss games like this. However, I think that my fear of it not being finished or what it could be may still be well founded.","March 10","true","8.0"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

I buy just about anything indie that pops up on Steam (that isn't 2D). So I saw this, the premise sounded interesting, so I grabbed it. I immediately got into the game and was presented with a VERY early release game that really shouldn't be on Steam at all.\n\nThe game menu starts with "Launch", "Settings" and "Abort". Settings consists of... "Toggle Fullscreen"... that's it. Nothing else. No keybinds, no graphics, no sounds, NOTHING. The other two menu options are self explanatory.\n\nIn-game you're presented with a couple tutorial tasks, but it throws you into the world with no real understanding of how to build, what each item does, and what's really needed.\n\nI found myself being frustrated with some of the game functions like building a couch for example. If I hover a section of the room, it gives me the build for the couch. If I move around and accidently touch a wall or door, the build option turns into a door and I have to cycle back through the build items again (using V and B keys). Annoying.\n\nI branched my outpost out with additional rooms and my characters refused to venture into it. I was left with having to cheat build to get the rooms to finish. Then, after I did that (having waited minutes for the NPC's to do it), my characters ventured that way by walking through walls.\n\nI felt pretty disappointed with this title. That's not to say that with patches and updates it wont be decent. It's one of those early releases that I'm left scratching my head wondering why this was accepted by Steam, let alone at a price tag of $25. I just missed by 5 hours, a 25% off sale which is also quite disappointing.\n\nAll in all... wait this one out. Give it time to really get fleshed out, and turn into a solid title before you give it a try. You might regret it now.

Maia shows great promise, and has a very low chance of succumbing to Early Access Syndrome.\n\nGameplay\n\nYour base is built into a mountain (the atmosphere of the titular Maia is toxic). If your colonists need to go outside (to build solar stills for water, wind turbines/solar arrays for power, collecting researchable things like non-sentient alien creatures and plants, or meteorites, etc) they will use the airlock. The suits they use outside are cumbersome and slow.\n\nInside the mountain-base you designate (much like Dungeon Keeper) areas to be mined out. Once empty areas can have rooms (such as a workshop, a research room, a living area, a hydroponics room, etc) built into them. You must then place a door, and other context specific items (for example workbenches and 3D-printers in the workshop, or beds/couches and toilets in the living area).\n\nOnce a game starts you must quickly build a workshop, and add a workbench. Once that is done you must build a power system (wind turbine/solar array, or a geo-thermal power plant as well as a "fly-wheel" energy storage (battery). Once a power system has been built you must place atmosphere generators. That all takes care of your urgent needs. You must however secure a food source (hydroponics, or animal farms) and continually satisfy the needs of your colonists.\n\nYou do not directly control your colonists.\n\nA note on the minimal UI\nThe devs of this game have stated from the outset that they don't want to 'spoon-feed' players to much information, and have designed the game in such a way that players must work for information. There is no "emotion bubble" that floats above your colonists, only biometric data like respiration rate, perspiration rate, heart-beats per minute, etc. This is just one example of a system that promotes player interaction and investigation as opposed to unrewarding spoon-feeding. All the information you'll need is there, you just have to find it.\n\nPros\nA cool, and compelling theme.\nEasy to understand game mechanics.\nA tutorial (I'm serious, how many games have a proper tutorial while in Early Access!).\nCons\nNo traditional savegames, instead you play one game at a time that can be continued if you exit the game and come back.\nNo bordered window mode.\nLacks detailed options (but there are resolution, anti-aliasing and quality options).\nNo goals/missions other than survival (Although the latest update has added three scripted missions).\nStill in Early Access.\nThe normal price of $24.99 is arguably too high for the current build (but will be a good price once Maia is feature complete).\nThe Early Access Problem\nMaia is still in Early Access (As I write this, Alpha version 0.51) which poses several problems with a recommendation. When it comes to Early Access many promising games are either; abandoned by their developers halfway through development, developed in such a way that early-adopters are angered, or have their developers react angrily from criticism. I believe that Maia, although not immune from such problems, is certainly free of them for the foreseeable future.\n\nDev Abandonment\nMaia has received regular updates, both small 'hotfixes' and major updates. The two latest major updates, Alpha 0.50 and Alpha 0.51 were deployed on the 3rd September 2015, and 22 October 2015 respectively. Each update adds a lot of new content, and fixes bugs.\nThe developer, Simon Roth, is also very active on Twitter and happily answers questions.\nBad Development\nSome Early Access games have started out promising but developed along different lines than what was promised. I don't think Maia is at risk of that as it's clear from development and the content of updates that Simon and his team have a clear plan and is sticking to it. Hopefully this will protect against feature-creep, and I have seen no evidence that it isn't.\nNaughty Developers\nSome strong games have been let down by their developers being taking criticism very badly and being rude - which does sometimes make people shy away from their games and makes adapters regret supporting such devs and their games. Simon and his team do not appear to be the type to do any of this though, as Simon is quite open on Twitter and I have never seen or heard any complaints regarding his behaviour.\n\nI wrote this review after playing 6.2 hours of Maia.","October 25, 2015","true","7.4"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","3"

Its a great concept, but the execution is very poor.\n\nI've been patronizing this game's early access since it was available for early access, and while some bugs have been fixed, numerous game-breaking bugs still remain. Its pretty-much unplayable still, despite several months development since its initial release.\n\nGlitches in character AI get them stuck in routines that eventually lead to their deaths. For example, eating and sleeping, repeat et infinitum, while not working on the hyroponics bay. The AI seems to get deadlocked quite a lot. Since the characters start running to the food and then eating, I assume that the value for hunger isn't being reset properly.\n\nThere are also animation problems that seem to somehow reflect character position. Character position in the world should not be a function of the 3D engine. The location of objects should be purely data, which is then rendered. The reason why I suspect this isn't the case in Maia is because characters "jump" back, particularly after a collision with a wall. Yes - they walk into walls and then teleport back a few steps. So the pathfinding is bad too. I think this is because the objects in the world are not on a real "grid" system. While rooms might be, everything else seems to be kinda "free-floating" and placable anywhere in the room / outside. While this would be cool, it doesn't work right, so its not cool.\n\nAlso the object rotation system is very annoying. It would be much better if there were a "spin by increment" key prior to object placement. And objects can intersect eachother, which makes no sense.\n\nAdditionally 6 mo after launch there's still no save / load system. The game still starts with invalid start conditions (breaches in the base start point to the outside world makes colonists unable to move around in the cavern without space suits, and the airlock is on the other side of the base). There is no way to make a new game without exiting to desktop and starting the game over. The settings are very minimal, and there are enormous problems with resolution. You click and it changes, in a cycle, rather than selecting from a menu. This is terrible because it saves the last setting, and there's no "does this resolution work for you?" dialog. This means you can get yourself into unusable settings and be unable to get out.\n\nAlso the game performance is really quite bad.\n\nMeanwhile the creators are adding content while there are still problems with the fundamental mechanics of the game. I wonder if they understand how unusable the game is right now....","October 5, 2014","false","8.3"," 50 of 77 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","50","77","0","0"

It explores the possibility of a human colony on an alien world. Even in its present unfinished state, Maia is worthy of purchase and full of potential for enjoyment and delight.\n\nOverview\nI first encountered Maia at a game show in 2014. Being fascinated by space exploration, I was immediately sucked in. Maia 'gets' space exploration in the same way DayZ 'gets' zombies: The story is not the zombies, it is the people.\n\nIn Maia, people are at the heart of the experience. They do what the want. They interact with each other. They may follow your orders, or they may laze about and die of starvation. They might threaten each other, become sad, grow happy, or develop relationships. They are truly a group of colonists, going about life on an alien world.\n\nGameplay\nInteraction with Maia is indirect. The player never builds structures, or conducts research. Instead, requests are placed in the world and colonists then react to those requests. I use the word 'request' rather than order, because colonists will not always carry out instructions.\n\nAt first, their ambivalence to a placed Atmosphere Generator may be interpreted as a bug in the game. With more play time it becomes apparent that the colonists have a sense of what is important, and what is required. Already have too many Solar Arrays? Colonists might simply choose not to build them.\n\nThere are no centralised mechanisms for managing colony power, food, and water requirements. Instead, individual stores must be inspected, and observations taken around the world. This quirk can sometimes be frustrating, but that frustration can give way to fulfillment - Balancing a power grid is very hard, and more rewarding for being so.\n\nOften I see Maia referred to as a 'God Game.' Having never played 'God Games,' and not being familiar with the genre, I can't speak to the accuracy of that description. I would not, however, describe Maia as a god game in the first instance: The player is not god, they are a companion. Not omniscient, omnipresent, or all-powerful at all. Instead, the player is limited, flawed, and often ineffectual - A reflection, perhaps, of the colonists pottering about on the planet surface, and all the more enjoyable for it.\n\nAeshetics\nGenerally, I am about as artistic as a pencil sharpener, so I'm not the one to judge Maia's aesthetics. But I think it looks fantastic.\n\nThe use of a custom renderer means the game does not express the intangible 'feel' of a commercial solution such as Unity or Unreal. Instead, it gives of a vibe of bespoke craftsmanship. Models are of a consistently high quality. Animations are well weighted and engaging - Though they are often blatantly disconnected from the gameplay their are supposed to be related to.\n\nTechnical\nEarly Access games come in various flavours of 'bugginess,' and Maia has tended to hover towards the 'very buggy' end of the spectrum through much of its development. Because Maia does not offer many explicit clues to the player about what is happening in the world, bugs can be insidious. A colonist sitting on the floor of a room may be bored and recalcitrant: Or their AI might simply be stuck in a buggy loop of doom.\n\nRecently, the Stardystopia Update has brought fresh stability and consistency to the experience. If Stardystopia is a foundation upon which Maia grows in future updates, then it has the potential to leave its challenged technical past behind.\n\nDevelopment\nJudging the character of Maia's development is perhaps the act in which my conflict of interest is most likely to manifest itself. It is also the area of which I am most critical.\n\nAn Early Access game must be open. To be on Steam Early Access to not just invite, it is to require the interaction of customers with the development team. It has been difficult for Maia's customers to find information about development. In the last few months, the team has made strides towards pulling down the fourth wall and letting information flow out to customers. This process must accelerate.\n\nThe pacing and content of development updates are strong. Most especially since around March this year Maia has received consistent, high quality updates that have steadily improved the game.\n\nMost importantly, Maia's development team has authentic soul and character. Simon, Caroline, Leanne, Ruairi, Hannah and others are committed, tireless, optimistic, and hard working. They want Maia to be a better product, and are constantly putting in the effort to make it so.\n\nConclusion\nMaia is a unique, captivating game. It explores the possibility of a human colony on an alien world. Even in its present unfinished state, Maia is worthy of purchase and full of potential for enjoyment and delight.","September 8, 2015","true","5.2"," 53 of 83 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","53","83","5","8"

This means that it's in development, some features aren't 100% correct, bugs 'may' be included (for now), and it's not a final product.\nMaia isn't your everyday resource planning, create, build kind of affair. Yes, it has those elements, but the game is way more technical and scientific. You have to bear in mind breathable atmosphere for your people. You have to watch for the core temperature and air flow. Create correct conditions for plant and animal life to grow. And watch that your people don't go loco and start losing their minds.\nGraphically the engine is quite well done. Visual representation of solar flares, and external radiation are well done. Of course these conditions affect your environment too.\nBuilding and placing objects is pretty easy to do, after some practice you'll be placing and moving about freely. Personally I would like to be able to zoom out a little further, but that's personal preference.\nLooking forward to more interaction with the wildlife - they are out in the wild, but I've yet to experience them attacking my crew, for example.\nThe addition of missions is a welcome one too. You have objectives to achieve and a time limit to do so. Once complete, you progress further on. I've not tried all of them but they certainly make you focus on the tasks in hand.\nJust remember - early on - Crew need clean air, food, water.

When/if things are resolved, will be ammended.\n\nGood potential in what is there but at this point after following the game for a few years now preceding the Early Access release it is still in dire need of:\n\n* Colonist behaviour tuning so they don't just feel like partially-autonomous robots just running about performing reactive duties - Missing are Social interactions, off-duty behaviour, interests, role ownership in that it doesn't take 5 colonist engineers to attempt to change a lightbulb. If one person decides they will own the job of changing light bulbs it should be their responcibility, and just generally seeing colonists do more than just bounce between reactions.\n\n* Some means for the player to actually be involved in the colony even if it's through passive influence events. Currently you say where rooms go and what objects go where, then you're done and have nothing to do forever except sit watching a rather interesting/destructive screensaver. Complex simulation inclusion is great for a game, but a game it does not make in itself if you have no avenue for continious engagement.\n\n* Cleaning up some of the AI in place, especially in the areas of pathfinding common occurance still for example is Imps walking through solid walls and then finding themselves stuck on the other side when they notice that wall is solid making the player demolish chunks of their base or cavern walls in reaction to buggy behaviour.","July 9, 2015","false","17.7"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

Like "Wow you shot me? Just hang on while I prepare to die... just a minute... almost there. Okay, dead"\n- There is nothing you can do about the bodies outside the base and sometimes the alarm will just keep warning about the base perimeter, even if everything out there is dead.\n- When you ask the colonists to build a materials hopper they just won't... until they feel like it. But then your entire base is completely full of rocks and they WON'T TAKE THE ROCKS FROM THE FLOOR AND PUT THEM IN THE HOPPER!\n- The colonists walk too slow. So slow that they often starve or fadigue to death on the way to their assignment.\n- There are not many things to do in the game, so the player may get bored REALLY FAST. No action, no jumpscares, no nothing... and it gets boring.\n- After you built the entire base, it will be too big, and the colonists will die because of fatigue due to their deficient AI.\n- When a colonist die from the fire on the atmosphere creator (?) it will become a burning corpse and won't move.\n- Sometimes colonists die and just stay there, standing... creepy.\n- Colonists will ignore bodies and people dying. This should be prioritized.\n\nMy reccomendations:\n(To the developer)\n- Fix the bugs before developing new stuff. People are getting tired of the bugs and are leaving the game.\n- Some more action would be a nice thing (if you really want to develop new stuff)\n- Make the colonists faster! They run and stop too much! It's so annoying.\n- In base, the colonists in the suit should walk faster.\n- Try to program a new AI. They should prioritize some stuff, like eating and resting! They die of thirst and hunger even when you have lots of water and food avaiable. I don't think a human being would starve to death due to his many assignments. He would eat and then work.\n- They get hungry too fast.\n\n(To the players)\n- The game has a really nice concept but is still in development. It's still unfinished! If you don't have patience to wait for the developer to fix stuff, just don't try any alphas. You will get tired and will just get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason.\n- If you do have a lot of patience, my advice: play it. The game is really cool and it makes you imagine all the possibilities for it in the future.

I was part of this game's IndieGogo campaign four years ago. I'm a huge Dwarf Fortress fan, and Maia was promised to be sort of like a Dwarf Fortress in space. This seems largely accurate, since Maia has been in an alpha release format for years, is designed around a story-lite rogue-like colony building simulation, and it has some pretty heavy detail on certain things (colonist moods, for instance).\n\nHowever, Dwarf Fortress is playable (your mileage may vary). Maia is really not playable and hasn't been for some time. I imagine that making a game is difficult, especially with a small independent team. However, the game got a couple hundred thousand dollars from Kickstarter and tens of thousands from the IndieGogo side. I do very much hope that I'll be able to change my review of this. In its current state, I cannot recommend it to anyone -- especially for this price. I don't regret buying into the crowdfunding campaign, but I am pretty disappointed at the abandonware/vaporware aspect of it. It has a lot of potential.

First I'll just list Pros and Cons in order then describe a little about it from my experience thus far,\n\nPros:\n-Neat idea worth expanding on\n-Good graphics for an alpha\n-Fun*\n-Harder sci-fi than some I've played\n-Devs work on the game and respond to feedback (Got an answer on the review initially)\n\nCons:\n-Bugs\n-More bugs\n-Occasionally problematic UI\n-Optimization issues\n-AI build priorities\n-Inability to manually control colonists\n\nSo, I'll start with the Pros. First off is the idea, I like it. It is always nice to see older style technology (Like the capsules the colonists land in) in a Sci-fi game instead of the constant use of sleek and streamlined ships and tech. Next up is the graphics, they are actually surprisingly good for an alpha game although I'll admit I've never been much of a snob about graphics. Now on to the "Fun" I mentioned, it is not fun in the sense of a fast-paced action kind of fun. It is more of a challenging fun associated with overcoming the challenges of survival. And finally, the last pro, "Hard" sci-fi. I find hard sci-fi to be more interesting a challenge in a game and that made it just a bit more interesting to me. For example: to get water you have to build a solar still and for food you need to build and maintain a hydroponics area instead of just building a food replicator or the like.\n\nNow on to the Cons. First off let's talk about the bugs, most of the other reviewers say that the dev/devs have focused on features over bugfixing (time will tell if that's true, I've only had the game a few days at time of writing.) I think the dev/devs should absolutely focus on bugfixes first, at least the game breaking ones that is. A good example of this has happened to me several times in a single game where I would call in some additional colonists and they would just stand outside the capsule waiting to die in their suits, that needs to be fixed. Apart from that, there are a few bugs I've encountered like one of my I.M.P. bots just standing in front of a fossil stand that was full holding a fossil and wouldn't dig or another one where my maintenance bots wouldn't go around the local Flora to repair my wind turbines so I had to manually drive them out and around the plants. Now that bugs have been adequately discussed let's move on to the UI. It is hardly there, kind of annoying to get used to, and is a little hard to use for rotating items without placing them. In addition to those, there is no way to save your game during it so you have to hope that it saves it. And, finally, on to the the optimization I mentioned. It freezes while loading it but eventually does get running. It is a minor issue but I did find it frustrating that the game freezes each time I start it even though it'll run well after it loads (with bugs and UI issues of course).\n\nTL;DR: It is definitely worth waiting on. I'll recommend it but with one planet sized caveat: it is buggy and very much an Alpha. In other words, watch the game and buy it when bugs get fixed.\n\n\n\n**UPDATE**\nI said I'd come and update the review over time, so I will. The bug with colonists getting stuck coming out of their pod is fixed. There are still some problems with AI priorities so far and the game crashes occasionally. For the AI priorities, I can set them to build the basics of a colony (Like heaters, atmosphere generators, and wind turbines) and they will not get around to much of it and die of hypothermia.\n\nOne new problem I have with it has emerged though, and it is admittedly a little bit nitpick-y. The problem is that the escape menu has no save option or "quit to main menu" button. I'm assuming it is a save and quit situation, but it is still a little odd that I can't save with how much it crashes for me at present. I'd be fine with a "save and continue" or "save and quit to menu" option or something similar.\n\nI'd still recommend following the game, it is interesting and you don't see too many more "hard sci-fi" styled games like it. I'd recommend buying it if you don't mind it being a little buggy or supporting the devs though.","January 4","true","8.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

It is fun! I do enjoy playing it! So, why can I not recommend it? Why am I writing a negative review? Because I do enjoy playing it. That is, when I can. When I don't mind waiting 5 minutes for the game to load to the main menu. When it doesn't crash on me (something that occurs far to often).\n\nI've been following this game for several year now. I bought into the alpha back in mid 2013, or at least well before it hit steam. It was in Alpha then, and is in Alpha now. Even Minecraft didn't take this long in alpha, and its alphas were far more stable. I was playing through this game just before writing this, wanting to record some footage to post online. I played for about 17 minutes, after which it crashed. Lost that save. And if I wanted to start it up again...whelp, gotta wait for the game to load the menu, in order to load the game. Oh, and DON'T EVEN THINK about changing any graphics settings, unless you want to wait a minute and a half until the game decides it's ready. Also, while this maybe due to me having a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4:3 monitor, but I could not play this game in any widescreen resolutions, even in windowed mode.\n\nThis game had, and still has, so much potential. If it wasn't so crash prone, and didn't take a lifetime to load, I wopuld recommend it. It is fun!....WHEN it works. The problem is, well, it tends not to. Not for very long, at least. It's as crashy now as it was back in 2013. 2 years, and still a crashy, buggy alpha. It feels like more effort has been put on gameplay and features, and less on fixing bugs. What good is gameplay, even amazing gameplay, if you're unable to enjoy it due to bugs and crashes? I want to play it more, I really do! It's just...why bother?

The game is currently in Alpha however it seems to be very pre-alpha at the moment. The game has a lot of potential but is lacking a few features right now. One of the biggest issues I have seen is the ability to save, right now there is no saving feature. With that, it doesn’t matter how far you have progress, in the end you have to start over again. There are a few glitches where your Colonist and Robot worker will ether stop working or would not complete tasks assign to them. The tutorial of the game is very limited but having them pop up is the annoying part.\n\nThe good thing is that if they brought out updates and improvement it might become a great game. However, so far it has been 22 days since the steam launch and it has had zero updates so far. If that changes or the game get better I may have to come back and change my review.

It's rare to have a responsive dev so I better take advantage.  The I.M.P. is much improved, no trouble with it ignoring orders.  However there is issue related to the I.M.P. but not really the I.M.P.s fault.  after it gets done digging it just stays there and when you build a room there's a good chance it'll get stuck inside a wall.  You can avoid that by giving it a dig order some where else so it'll move away but you have to remeber to do it and sooner or later I always forget.  I think the best way to fix this would be to program the I.M.P. to automatically go to the nearest storage unit and wait there when it completes any job it has so it will be safely out of the way and I won't need to remember.  Another fix would be the ability to destroy rooms.  As far as I know you can't destroy rooms but I havn't chaecked the tutorial in forever so I might be wrong on that.  There are two other concernes.  I notice after a long while the colonists seem to lose focus on building blueprints.  This only seems to happen after the base gets pretty big so it might be because they are busy repairing things, not sure if repairing is prioritized over building.  In future plays I'll try and remeber to use more than one repair drone and see if that helps.\n\nThe other thing is the windmills.  They keep falling down.  I always put turrets by my windmills so I'm pretty sure it's not wild life getting them.  Often times it happens so fast I don't think it normal wear and tear, I'm lucky if I get two days out of them.  Solar arrays are working great though just don't forget to use generators so you get power through the night and the generators are working perfectly in my experiance.

I like the idea and the visual approach. The game play took a bit of getting used to and given it's still being polished I can't really base the review too much on it. Yes there are things I'm hoping that will be fixed, like selection squares that do not dissapear upon deselection, room tiles that don't go away after cancelling the construction, people who take forever to build things while running about aimlessly back and forth. Robots who can't always reach their mining destination despite doing so earlier is another thing I've been bumping into quite often. Or people dying of starvation or malnutrition despite having full stock of rations. I should also add my humans last a veeeery long time without a bathroom.\n\nOne of the major things I would find helpful is having more information on  item descriptions. While some are self explanatory, a short line saying what it does and what it requires to work would be great to have. I had to go online to see what does what so far. Another thing I'd personally appreciate is being able to prioritise construction in some way according to your selection or order in which a specific item was placed.\n\nAll in all I will be keeping an eye on further updates and I think I will have more and more fun with the game in the future.","March 24","true","9.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

Of course, you can never really tell with Early Access games, but first impression is it's allright. Not exceptionally awesome, but pretty good. I'd even say at least slightly above average. It was definitaly worth the money and you get pretty much everything that's being advertised. What suprised me most is that, unlike many other alpha-games, this game has exceptionally little and few bugs. Sure, you get the occasional crash (at least on win10), which can be frustrating if you haven't saved in a long time, sometimes colonists get stuck and die, object "health" sometimes becomes negative which will result in the object not getting any repairs ever but all this happens rather rarely and doesn't really have too much of a disrupting influence. All in all, i'm pretty glad i've bought this game.\n\nquick summary:\n\n+ rather bug free\n+ you get everything that you see in the trailer\n+ the game can be played almost without any disturbances\n+ no game-breaking bugs (at least none that i encountered)\n\n- no autosave (at least not that i know of)\n- game sometimes crashes (at least on win10)\n\nso i'd say, if you don't mind running into small bugs occasionally or (seemingly) random game-crashes and you like the game's concept, go ahead and buy it, even if it's just to support the developer.","April 14","true","10.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","5"

I absolutely love that the development team works to publish regular updates to the game about once per month; each time adding neat new features (it's an alpha!) and working through the known bugs that have been reported and reproducible.\n\nIn particular, I love the heat simulation and new room layout mechanism in the most recent update. The former adds a layer of management detail that is complementary to other base needs, while the latter presents a more intuitive and visual way of "painting" the layout of your base than the existing system (you placed entire room tiles with a click). Then they worked to add in color a color picker for the lights, which affects the colonists' moods and plant growth rates. Oh and a brand new scripted mission to play through. So, plenty of new features each month to go along with learning what exactly it is your colonists need to stay alive and form a self-sufficient colony.\n\nI've definitely enjoyed the open development of this game.

It's an Alpha right now and it shows. AI improvements should be priority #1 over texture/graphics improvements. Structure placement (i.e. placing hydroponics or beds) should be #2. I had a colony die because a hole opened up in the ground under one of my bulkhead doors and destroyed it, effectively cutting off my hydroponics room from the rest of the colony with 3 colonists trapped inside. I routed some new doors through another part of the complex but the colonists just wouldn't build them. So basically everyone on the outside of the hydroponics room starved to death, everyone on the inside died of fatigue because they couldn't make it to the beds. I hope there is a better save option in the next update, because crashes are going to hapen often. Also, my robot keeps getting stuck places and just stands there even though I give him a clear path and give new orders. Sometimes it gets stuck if it wanders into a spot where a colonist is building something. In my last game, mine got stuck inside the materials hopper.\n\nI'm going to give this a recommendation because I can see where the developers want to take it, in hopes that they actually follow through and dont end the project in favor of another.","January 7, 2015","true","11.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game still feels pointless, there doesn't seem to be any way to prioritize certain actions over others for your colonists. You end up querying items like the Atmos processor and material hopper constantly to see how much stuff you have on hand. There is little feedback about how you are meeting or failing to meet colonists needs.\n\nI do like the goal of this game, the graphics, and the sense of humor but it feels like "shiny" updates are being prioritized over core functionally.\n\nI'd really like this game to prove me wrong and turn into a sensational game, but based on it's past year of development, I really doubt it.","December 8, 2013","false","3.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","3"

My first experience playing the game, two of my people were stuck inbetween a wall, and another one decided to walk outside and suffocated. I don't see the benifit of building buildings, as right now they seem to do nothing. I could do nothing and sit for a couple hours and watch my colonizers eat and drink endlessly. The game is in dire need of instructive goals: For example, your first goal being to build a water  supply. It then walks the player through the steps to get water. First build a workshop, then collect minerals, etc. This game has great potential, but the alpha is a weak shell of what it's going to be. A first goal that the player can strive to is to protect his or her own colony. Reduce the amount of start food, and have gradually increasing amounts of enemies. (PS.

I can see "Dungeon-Keeper" and "Evil-Genius'" trade mark right there and perhaps the "The Sims" as well.\n\nI've only managed to get as far as  sussesfully adding a Workshop room with two of three Work-Desks and Two Working Lights before the Robot who digs the rooms out just froze and then started to move around in small circles depsite being given orders to dig out another room. It's the only thing in this game that can do this. Apart from retreive the rocks, rubble and other detrius from where he deposited after digging. Not much else could be done beyond this.\n\nAccording to what I had been intructed to do in order to continue playing the game. I had to build a work shop with a desk and a light. 3 by 3 squares is the mnimum size requirement. For starters.\n\nThw rokshop is need to be built first before anything else can be done.\n\nIn previous gaming session, I had tried to make bigger rooms and had marked out acouple of them to be cleared as well as trying to furnish the other rooms as well  as outside. This was mistake. Evryhting should be done slowly and sectiojn by section or else pople start dying (Aphyxiation or Mal-nourishment.)and they need to be replaced and the robot just stops moving. Refusing to do anything. On two occsions, he got caught between the wall where it had been digging and the wall of the room that had been built by the human working on top of him. So, I need to be careful to let the robot do what it can first before the humans  perform their duties.\n\nI think this needs to be addressed.\n\nI might add a video later.\n\nLooking forward to the finished product.\n","June 30, 2014","true","52.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I also like how building a new room will give you access to new objects that you can construct. The AI of the robot and colonists needs to be improved. I don't know how far you can go in the game because I have always had to restart because of colonists not building objects that I place after I've spent some time in the new game, or the robot not mining out an area that I've assigned it, or because the characters get stuck in eachother.

The aforementioned save system works fine now, the game is a lot more stable, and has many more features and content. The AI pathing and priorities are still buggy, but the developer is working on them.\n\nThe caveat at the bottom still applies, but there is more substance to the game now. Considering it was up until recently a one man dev team, its at least a good effort. Worth peeking at if you can get it on a 50% or more sale, not recommended at full price unless you're a big fan of the game concept and know what you're getting into.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nA neat game with a good concept, but is nowhere near playable in any respect YET. Currently (as of 19th June 2014) the game lacks such features as working save system, game stability, solid AI pathing, room code management and much more.\n\nWith more funding/staff or time this game can be amazing, but right now? Don't even.\n\nAs of current version I recommend this game, with a HUGE caveat; Know what you're getting into: An unfinished, very early alpha of what could possibly be a great game. If you trust the developers wont get sick of the game and run off with the money (anyone remember Towns?) then give it a go and see. If you want a fully functioning game, keep it on the wishlist and wait until it gets out of early access.","July 19, 2014","true","20.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

At this point, I'd HIGHLY suggest saving your money until they get all of the bugs sorted out. I'd suggest buying it if it goes on sale for $10 or less. The game reminds me a lot of Majesty, except, when you tell the builders to build things, they don't even do it half the time or you have to wait at least 30 minutes real life time to build something even when it's necessary AND you even have the materials (for example, the colonists are dying of fatigue, but they won't build beds when I have the materials ready to go). The additional colonists that drop in just sit in front of their landing pod and don't do anything but sit and die. That's how buggy it is. Mostly unplayable at this point. I'm sure it will be a great game when all of it is sorted out, but for the love of all that is good, know what you are getting into if you disregard this advice.

Build too many essential things which are needed (turbines) and watch your crew spend all their time maintaining and repairing machines and completely neglecting everything else such as eating or sleeping.

I like what I see.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that this game is in alpha. Now I know a lot of people go, "Oh I'm a software developer, I know what alpha is! This isn't it!" Those people are dumb and probably liars because, hey, this is the internet. So from a completely normal, non-developer girl: This game is in alpha. It's obviously in alpha. It is not feature complete. There is very little in the way of UI and things people expect to be there (like cancelling orders for objects) are not there.\n\nBut the concept is there. You can see things working. You can ooh and aah at the pretty graphics because they do look really freaking nice. One thing you can't do is play much. You can't save. Why? It's in alpha. Alphas are not feature complete. They lack many things we've grown used to and honestly take for granted in games. The developer isn't lying to you. They aren't tricking you. They're being very honest that the game is very deep in development. It says that right there on the tin.\n\nSo if you don't want to see and experience a slice of game development, if you can wait and be patient, or if you hate bugs and incomplete UI... Then don't invest in this right now. If you can't wait, if you like to see a game grow and change, or if you want to help with development then do invest in it.\n\nSo I'll say it again: I like what I see here. I can't wait for more.

NO MORE LOG ENTRIES! This game has plenty of bugs but hey its in alpha and I'd say it is pretty great! If you are into beating your head against the wall until you learn how to prioritise what you need to do this is most certaintly the game for you! Once you've got a strategy going the game becomes even more fun but the colonists need you to hold their hands at times, such as when they are wounded, I had to herd my colonists to the medbay by locking doors, didn't lose anyone but it was kinda annoying. Also if the AI glitches the IMPs movement or colonist movement when it comes to objectives just lock and unlock a door real quick and that seems to fix it, weird huh? But it works so I can't complain! This game reminds me of Space Colony by Firefly and some other developers, if you can manage to get your hands on a copy of that I'd recommend you do so post-haste!

However I think a good number of the of the reviews have been a bit unfair.  A lot of the reviews aren't taking into account how early this game really is in development.  Yes that is the fault of the devs for jumping the gun, and putting it on the market, however the game does show a lot of progress, and it's a really good concept.  It is extremly buggy at the moment but that's to be expected of any early access game.  That's why I'm not considering the bugs in this review but I'm focusing on the content.  The devs have done a good job of keeping this game as a more realistic survival/ managment game, and that's nice to see, since it's not really something that has been done that much.\n\nHOWEVER! I don't write reveiws for the sake of the devs, but for the sake of the customer.  This game is a big risk!  It's very hard to tell how this game is going to turn out at this stage since it's in such a raw state.  I myself think that it's going to turn out well, and that's why I'm giving a positve review.  However unless you're a risk taker I would advise that you hold off for a little while before you buy this game, and keep an eye on it from afar.","October 4, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The short (but very humorous) tutorial tells you how to move the camera and how to place rooms and not much else when there are certainly more things to be explained. For example the game said it was toxic and dangerous outside and so I just assumed I couldnt go outside until I unlocked something but after an embarrisingly quick death I couldnt figure out what I did wrong but the next time I played I was told to just put something outside (by an external source) and what do you know, they have SUITS! would have been nice to know. I built at least one of each type of building but couldnt figure out what any of them did. They said I needed a workbench but after I managed to build one I had no idea what it did and I only figured out what that robot did by watching that video.\n\nLong story short : Cool idea but PLEASE make the tutorial more indepth!","January 17, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I can tell you that it has sat on my wishlist for quite some time before I bought it during the sale. I have watched with some interest as the game has developed. Having now, albeit briefly, played it for myself I can say that - in it's current state I cannot in any good conscience recommend this to my friends in its current state.\n\nThat's not to say that Maia hasn't got potential, it certainly has. But the fulfilment of that potential is a long, long way off.\n\nThe most glaring shortfall here is the staggeringly poor optimisation. All early access excuses aside, this is a game that is charging almost £20 to get players to poke around at what is currently available - the scope of which is very limited, and in my opinion, not especially fun either - for that money I would have expected that the game engine would be in some sort of state that was reasonably optimised for the very broad range of system builds that comes from PC customers. Whilst the game is not unplayable, it's always irksome when a system that vastly exceeds the recommended spec splutters along at 12 frames per second, like some elderly man with a cold.\n\nThe second issue I had was with the minimalist UI. This is subjective and some people will like it, but for whatever it's worth, I didn't. Having to blindly cycle through construction options using 1-9 and B and V felt unintuitive and was something I can't ever see myself getting used to. That being said, I liked the way I could place items pretty much wherever the hell I wanted in a room, that felt smooth and comfortable to get along with.\n\nAnother thing that struck me was the very sparce tutorial. Alright, alright, so it's not rocket science this and for the majority of people, there isn't much that is going to need explaining, you can figure stuff out just by playing around with the game, plus it's an alpha, I have yet to see a game in it's alpha state that has a fully fleshed out tutorial. Nonetheless, I feel that the areas covered by the tutorial were hastily put together, and not especially informative.\n\nWhilst i'm on the subject of tutorials, the dialogue. Being British myself, I 'get' that whoever wrote the tutorial was attempting  to create the lofty humour of a smug, arrogant ai. However. At the early stages of the game, it's a bit jarring, and doesn't lend itself well to imparting knowledge. Those of you who played Frozen Synapse may remember the tutorial and it's deeply condescending dialogue. That worked for two reasons: 1. It was offset by a more pleasant dialogue as a counter and 2. It was voice acted so it felt like a infinitesimally intelligent ai and not, in the case of Maia, simply the developers quietly sneering at it's customers. In this instance it comes across as not only churlish, and dare I say, a little rude, but also because of it's delivery, entirely misses the target of being funny.\n\nAnother bone of contention was that there was no feedback to see what was being worked on. Not being one to build one thing at a time, I slapped down a load of stuff and waited. It was hard to tell whether people were working on something, or just running around like lunatics. Another thing is that I had very little feedback on what it was that my colonists needs were at any given time, it would be nice to be able to see a general overview of that at a glance.\n\nMaia might be a good game one day if it's devs stick to the plan and don't get too lost in the woods on the way, but it's a long was off that chequered flag, and at this juncture there really is no guarantees that it will be good in the end. My enthusiasm has certainly been significantly dowsed by playing the game in it's current state, and I have to say, I regret paying the money, but you never know, maybe i'll have gotten a good deal in the long run, only time will tell at this point. Only really worth investing if you really have an overwhelming desire to support the developer or have an incredibly optimistic disposition.

Oh and space chickens. Well I have played this twice and the game needs much more development. The tutorial is lax and needs more input, maybe hints of what to build first liek...oh I dont know and atmosphere generator (Will come back to this point). It took a few goes before I figured out that the robot is accessible, you dont click on it. you click on rock formations and he digs bits of the rock face out and you can then build your colony. No tutorial on how to use him though. Colonists are unuseable, they do what they want to do.\n\nI have played this a number of times and each time my colonists died of asphyxiation. Every time, even when I build atmosphere generators. This game is currently a no go without a decent tutorial. Its not a game per sae currently, its really a large project in futility and how to kill space colonists off the quickest.\n\nThumbs down, I bought this knowing it was an early access game and they are stillworking on it, but this ... is embarrassing, It does not hold a candle to Dungeon Keeper. And yes my hours played looks low. Trust me if you have a Vista or earlier made computer this game will crash badly. My hours are lower than what it says above, its included crashes and time i tried tofigure out how to fix it.\n\nIn my humble opinion, wait 6 months then have a look at reviews on here. See if some of the issues have been fixed but there are better things to waste money on than this. Free to plays are plentiful, this kind of half made game is far to commomn on Steam.

Its list of faults is longer than a bad year, so I won't even try to name them all.\n\nThat said, it shows a lot of promise. I am looking forward to the finished product, when it is released.

Or, failing that, at least a finished game.\n\nUpdate:\nWork continues. Although my colonists and the IMP remain utterly useless.

However unlike the others i was struck by only the flaws of this game which for me ruined the atmosphere it was trying to create. the games main issues i ran into while playing it was how poorly optimised it was, i spent $2000 on a computer well and truely capable of running crysis 3 on ultra with power to spare but with this the same computer had massive issue trying to keep the fps above 1 and therefore found it almost always unplayable. other issues i noticed was people not building objects or using them to stay alive. e.g they all died of exhaustion because they wouldn't go to bed. i didnt even get to have them die off from the aliens or lack of food, air and water.\n\nanother annoying thing about this game is it launching command prompt to run its self, i was afraid i'ld have to write some coding to make it work.\n\nso my verdict is for those who are looking to buy this i say to not waste your money, the game in its current state is more dodgy than my spelling and gramma skills. i do see a future for this game but it has a tough future ahead of it to break its current state of yet another building game, and a little more work on having a story and fancier menu would be a minor improvement in a long list of issues.\n\nVerdict: Wait till its at least at version 1.0.0\nRating: 3/10","July 3, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

I've been following Maia for a while but I've never bought an early release game and was hesitant to do so. I few weeks, maybe a month ago I bought Prison Architect, which is also an early release game and it was great, it seems complete even though they are still working on it. Then just a few days I decided to buy Maia, I believed for the price it would be fun to play and see how it would grow through updates.\n\nHowever I can't play. I installed in on my computer and when I start it up I get a little document which flashes and then shut downs, not even making it to the actual game. I reinstalled it, didnt work.  Changed around with the screen scenes and it didnt do anything. So I tried to install it on my cousins computer. I got so excited when the game launched, I got to what I guess was the loading screen before it faded white and said, "Maia.exe has stopped working."\n\nI dont believe both computers have issues, I would like to think it was simply an early release bug, but they are two different problems. So for now, I would not recommend this game until this is fixed. I do hope this can be fixed with a future update as I really would like to try out this game.","April 25, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

It needs to fix the preformance, AI, notification system, and other minor bugs/issues. I have an ASUS 760 graphics card that can play Assassin's Creed Black Flag at max settings with no problems, but this game makes me lag badly whenever something big happens! The AI will biuld a workbench, but nothing else which will cause them do eventualy die! Also, whenever a notification pops up, it stops the game instantly and makes you read it.

The game is not near ready to play for money. Make it free for few months and remove the errors, glitches and other stuff that needs to be fixed. Instructions on how to play are not clear, it is anoying, and slower than reading from a piece of paper, it has to be interactive, or atleast have photos of the things you need to use. There is no save option, none that I found atleast in this version.

Combine this with spontaneous earthquake-style events damaging critical machinery like airlocks and life support, some of which are unfixable, and you've got yourself a dealbreaker.\n\nDid I mention the appalling framerate and frequent CTDs?

Throughout teh years many games about colony survival hit the games market and only a couple gained a place in our memories. e.g. Outpost, Space Colony, Startopia. But, most of those games are lost in the vast endless space of cybernet.\n\nSo, how able is Maia in obtaining a place amongst our memory?\n\nAt this point, it's a buy and forget game. Not because of the way it looks, it's probably one the best looking colony survival games out there, but because of the way it tries to create an atmosphere.\nI don't know exactly why, but something is missing.. The feeling of survival. Why should I build s**t if I don't care. Why should I research things if I don't see the point in doing so.\nThis is probably because of the lack of any solid plot and future goal that keeps me interested.\nYea, sure, my goal is to survive. Yea, whatever, I'm playing a game, I want some glittering prices along the way and some motivation to do some crazy things. I'm playing a game to escape the dull side of reality, so please, don't show me my daily struggle.\nIn other words, we need a good Visual Novel style content / plot / story. We need interesting characters and social dillema's.\n\nIf Maia is able to provide us with those things in the near future, well, in that case we might have ourselves a winner.\nBut, as long as it stays the way it is (Bugs not taken into account) it's a dull experience.\n\nMy final verdict, which might sound strange, is "Yes"not bad, actually pretty good, because it shows good potential.\n\nOn the other hand, I won't hesitate to put out a huge "NO" if the developers don't change the "Living" part of the game. The social interaction, story and story driven motivation.","December 4, 2013","true","0.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

This is why indie game's don't sell. I want my money back.\n\nThis game stinks. I'm sorry I voted for it in greenlight. I'm very sorry I wasted $24 on it. I'm even more sorry the publisher recieved any of my money. Crime shouldn't pay.\nIt doesn't work with Window's 8.\nI had to put the Maia.exe into XP sp3 compatibility mode to get it to launch. Still it only would launch 1/3 of the time. It goes looking for driver's that should be provided, if needed. Once inside the game, the controls are terrible. Most of the time they don't respond. I couldn't get it to demolish doorways to expand rooms properly. The game kept wanting to place things instead.\nThere is no sidebar to select the items you want to place, like in any other building game. There is no demolish button. You have to go into the main game file and open a readme text file to find out what the controls are. There should be a sidebar icon for each of the controls, like any other building game. In game messages are very difficult to even read because they are distorted by a pointless green line distortion effect... Forget anything like a voice tutorial... The 2 main challenge's in a game shouldn't be getting it to launch or getting the control's to work.  I don't care if game publisher claim's this game is in perpetual Alpha. I expect $24 worth of game for $24. The can be no excuse for the shabby state of this game.

But what lets it down most of all is the AI (A CORE MECHANIC OF THE GAME).
