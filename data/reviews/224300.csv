It picks up shortly after the events of LoK: Soul Reaver 2. Raziel has managed to pospone his fate, and Kain still lurks around in the shadows, trying to discover ways to restore balance to the world of Nosgoth.\nIn a departure for the series, the game takes a more action-based approach to combat and gameplay. You no longer have to toss enemies into lakes or fire to kill them (though that’s still an option in many places), but instead what you get is more enemy variety and much tougher battles. Kain and Raziel’s skills are largely interchangeable, with both playing the same. Except Kain is stronger and Raziel is faster. Both, once fully experienced, can pull off insane combos.\nAs the other games of the series, Defiance has puzzles as well, some more grueling than others. But all rather cleverly designed.\nThe Legacy of Kain series has some of the highest quality voice acting around. The entire cast brings all of the characters to life, from the protagonists to the ever-embittered Vorador, melencholy Janos, devious Moebius, even the vampire hunters and undead.\nThe graphics in this game are the best in the series so far. The characters are all well designed and the use of Gothic backgrounds suits the game well.\nLegacy of Kain: Defiance delivers what it promised, the continuation of the series that answers more questions then it proposes, a refined combat system and replay value. This game will be sure to twist and make that brain think through it's depth-full storyline.\n\nSounds 10/10\nGraphics 9/10\nGameplay 9/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","December 18, 2013","true","12.3"," 113 of 120 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","113","120","0","1"

Once again I recommend getting Xpadder so you can properly bind a modern gamepad to play this.\n\nThe game itself is a step down exploration wise from Blood Omen, Soul Reaver, and Soul Reaver 2, and has a lot more in common with Blood Omen 2's linear traversal (removing any sort of exploration beyond secrets).\n\nStory wise it's just as good as Soul Reaver 2 and the first Blood Omen.\n\nSadly this is the last game in the series, as Eidos never got around to making another one. Its lead writer went to NaughtyDogg to make Uncharted and The Last of Us, and most of the creative team disappeare.d\n\nFew failed attempts at making sequels later we are left with nothin but a multiplayer game lacking any sort of story.\n\nThis is a sad end for one of my favorite game series.

Truly a masterpiece. Must-have classic. Story-driven and atmospheric.\n\nP.S: For those who are having issues/crashes, here's a fix:\n1)Run the game.\n2)Open Task Manager.\n\nFor Windows 7 or older:\n3)Go to the Processes tab. (Second tab from left to right)\n4)Find and right click the defiance.exe process.\n\nFor Windows 8/10:\n3)Go to the Details tab. (Second tab from right to left)\n4)Find and right click the defiance.exe process.\n\n5)From the menu, click Set Affinity.\n6)A window will pop up, showing a list. In the list you'll have the following: <All Processors>, CPU 0, CPU 1, CPU 2, etc. (depending on the amount of cores your CPU has, you'll see that many in the list. Note that the first core is counted as CPU 0, so if you see, for example, from CPU 0 to CPU 7, those are your 8 cores.)\n7)From this list, uncheck everything but CPU 0. This will set the process to use only 1 core from your CPU.\n8)Now you can tab back into the game and play. Enjoy!\n\nNOTE: You will have to repeat this every time you relaunch the game, as it's not a permanent change. This should however fix crashes/graphical issues/cutscene stuttering. I did notice a micro-stutter after the intro going into the first cinematic, but aside from that every other cinematic will run fine.\n\nAnother fix you can apply to the game (fixes some graphical issues for Windows 10):\n1)Go to the game's installation folder. (Should be in your Steam\steamapps\common\legacy_kain_defiance, or in whichever folder you installed the game in)\n2)Right click the defiance.exe.\n3)Go to Properties, then to the Compatibility tab.\n4)Check the "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" box, and then select Windows XP Service Pack 2.\n\nNOTE: This is a permanent change, as in no need to redo it, unlike the previous fix.","June 24, 2015","true","30.6"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","38","41","0","1"

That is a resounding YES! unlike in the previous game where you would have to rebind keys for over an hour and you have the 'issue' of the two 'movement' keys (see Soul Reaver 2 review).

And once you get your controller set up the way you like it, the characters are responsive and it feels good to wreak havoc on whatever decided to cross your path. It's not all sunshine and daisies though. If you've played previous games in the series, you know the camera was decent. It wasn't great in previous installments, but good enough to get by with. In Defiance on the other hand, they seemed to think that cinematic camera angles would make for a more enjoyable experience. Anybody remember the cinematic camera angles of the early Resident Evil games? Well, they were alright compared to this. Your ability to navigate the world is destroyed by the fact that it is impossible to get your bearings when you're unable to actually look around. All in all, it's worth a playthrough if you can ignore the camera issues (you won't be able to, I assure you).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arakangara/recommended/224300/","arakangara","Arakanga.Ra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arakangara/","583 products in account","As much as I love this game, I have to say that it's not for everyone. First of all, you should understand that this is the last part of Legacy of Kain pentalogy. Yes, pentalogy. Unfortunately, the very first part, Blood Omen, is not sold by Steam. Shame, because it's one of the best classical RPGs. But back to Defiance.\n\nGameplay-wise, this game isn't really special. It's a specific hack-and-slash game with several action adventure elements. There are some very frustrating moments with cameras and it's best played on gamepad (though I had some problems with remapping the buttons). If you are a keyboard player, then no problem, but you'll need to change the controls to your liking. You can't really change the graphics and even though the characters or environment don't look very bad, it's evident that the game was released in 2003. And, since this is the pentalogy's conclusion, if you don't know the story, you'll miss the best part of this game.\n\nNow for the good parts. First of all, for the first time in the series, the game is not only about Kain (Blood Omen) or Raziel (Soul Reaver), but about both. In odd levels you play as Kain, in the even ones as Raziel. Though both are similar in their range of movements and controls, there are some significant differences (Reavers, realm-shifting). This changing of characters allows the game to run two separate, yet connected story lines. To continue, Legacy of Kain series have always been known for atmospherical, original music (by Kurt Harland). The soudtrack is flawless. The characters are memorable, they've come a long journey and I can honestly say that Legacy of Kain has the most developed and believable characters I've seen in the gaming world. The voice acters did an amazing job - my personal favorite is Michael Bell as Raziel, but there isn't a single poorly dubbed character. And the story. If you like complicated, dramatic and epic stories, Legacy of Kain is the best you can get. The story combines both personal tragedies and events that affect the whole world of Nosgoth. It's very strong, some scenes will just leave you breathless.\n\nTo conclude - even though it's somewhat linear and the gameplay shifted from action adventure to more hack-and-slash type, the game is fun and I recommend it. I'd say that even a person who never played a Legacy of Kain game before can play it and enjoy it, but if you want a truly memorable experience, play the previous games and save this for the last. It's a great finale of an escalating story that no fan of epic stories should miss.","June 10, 2014","true","1.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

The game was rated R for Blood and Gore alone, and I'm sure the gameplay can suffice for a few lousy camera angles, and some thrilling action.\n\nUPDATE!!!: You should get an xbox controller, or a programmable mouse / controller to play this game. The default controls are shakey on PC, as this was definitely intended for the Playstation. I would most likely extend this comment to all other Legacy of Kain games.","August 31, 2013","true",""," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's a fairly good game. The story is brilliant, as always, as is the voice acting. The gameplay is a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nTo start with: the camera. The camera is no longer a chase-cam, like the last 3 games. Instead, it's a kind of Devil May Cry camera that shifts, rotates and generally gets on your nerves. It frequently changes when you are in the middle of performing a precise action, like jumping - which screws up what you were doing.\n\nSecondly: too much repetitive combat. Okay, to be fair, the other games have also suffered from this, but LoK seems to simply have more of it. It gets tiresome and I found myself avoiding combat wherever possible. Certain levels have you running backwards and forth with wave after wave of enemy re-spawning after every battle. It gets annoying very quickly.\n\nThose things aside, the rest of the game is pretty solid. It looks lovely, sounds great and the puzzles are a little more diverse than titles such as BO2. Story is great and it is good fun to be able to play both Kain and Raziel (although bar some animation differences, they play very similar to each other). The main difference between the two is that Raziel is blessed with more engrossing puzzles, while Kain is simply given more enemies to mash. Raziel also has the spectral realm to play around in, which of course, Kain does not have.\n\nLoK fans will like it (as I have), but it leaves you wondering just what they could have accomplished with the format - and such a shame that certain elements were not improved upon.\n\nJimbo Rating: 6/10","April 23, 2014","true","8.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

Unlike SR1 & SR2, I have encountered a bug that needed to be fixed before being able to play. In my case it was that the game DOES NOT SUPPORT MULTIPLE MONITORS. After unplugging my external monitor the game worked just fine but it does take from the rating. Iconic combat and puzzles remained also in this part of LoK series although both have been altered a bit to fit the story line. The game remains challenging but I dislike that they removed the mechanic of shifting between physical and spectral realm, thus making death permanent for Raziel and it creates a need to reload. Story wise it does make sense however and they replaced it with swtiching between Raziel and Kain (not when you want though). Boss fights are great again and they learned their lesson from SR2. Story and narrative is REALLY why I love this series of games! The writers had to tackle the usual time-travel issues but I think they managed to pull it off in the end with the whole alternate timeline. Voice acting remained excellent and Defiance has a really cool soundtrack too. Finally, the game builds up for the finale and gives us awesome boss battles, including the final one. The story of Raziel the Soul Reaver ends in an epic way and is a must for fans of the series. Overall a good game that finishes off the LoK series and I recommend it if you can get past the bugs and older graphics.","October 30, 2014","true","0.1"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","1"

It's recommended to play through the other games which Soul Reaver 1 and 2 are avaliable currently on steam as well. If story, writting, or voice acting are a huge favored thing in games for you, get this series now.\n\nThe gameplay is solid as well, having mix of advtenture elements such as platforming with puzzle solving and combat that becomes progressivly better throughout.

The final game in the Lok Series. Did they end it on a high note? Well, Yes and No.\n\nThe Story and Characters have a very satisfying conclusion which makes you think how long they have thought about it.\nIt feels like they had everything planed since the first game. “Witch most game trilogys don’t” You find out everyone’s fate, everyone’s purpose, everything the wheel of fate wanted them to do.\n\nThe voice acting is “and this goes for Soul Reaver 1 & 2 also” some of the best in any video game. Michael Bell as Raziel, Simon Templeman as Kain, Richard Doyle as Moebius And by far the best, Tony Jay as the Elder God.\n\nBut what about the gameplay? Well I thought the gameplay in Soul Reaver 1 & 2 was just fine but defiance tries something a bit different.\nIt’s now a lot more linier and the combat has been overhauled. The new combat system is fun with some unique moves.\nIt feels very “Devil May Cry” like, but not as good.\n\nThere is still puzzles but they’re so obviously brain dead, it’s like why did they bother? With the other 2 games there is a lot more freedom.\nSure both games were linier “Well the first game doesn’t tell you where to go or what to do” But it felt natural how everything came together.\nAlso in the other 2 games you can use multiple weapons. “although the soul reaver is still pretty ♥♥♥♥ing badass” Like Spears, Swords, Axes, Tortches,Etc. I’m not saying the new combat system is bad, it isn’t, it’s great. I guess I just like the older one better.\n\nOf course I highly recommend playing the first 2 before this, storywise if you just jump in to this you will have no clue what is going on.\n\nLegacy of Kain Defiance is a satisfying ending to the LoK series but personally, I would’ve wanted a perfected Soul Reaver 2. I only recommend it to fans of the LoK series. 7/10","February 21, 2013","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

With both of them being very strong characters, I really enjoyed seeing the story unfold from both sides.\n\nCombat for both characters feels very similar, so repeatedly switching between them does not cause any issues. Out of all Legacy of Kain games, the combat in Defiance has always felt the smoothest and most fun to me. However, it can't be denied that with the game being over 10 years old, it's not as entertaining as it used to be.\n\nAs with the previous games, the dialogue in Defiance is amazing to the point that I often find myself rewatching the cutscenes on YouTube.

You'll spend most of the game finding elemental reavers, navigating the same environments and solving boring puzzles. If at first you may find the battle system improved, you'll soon come to the realization of how basic it really is, thanks to the game's over-reliance on it. The way the game is segmented feels unnatural and pace-breaking. The fixed camera angles rarely work in the game's favor. Character interactions and plot progress feel rare, when compared to SR2's expertly distributed story exposition. The graphics feel, at times, worse than SR2's. I can only assume Crystal Dynamics had significant budget limitations when making this game.\n\nSo, what good is there here? Well, things get really interesting in the the final hours with a lot of exposition, confrontations and character interaction. The conclusion was satisfying to me, but I can see others not being completely content with it. But all the good the game has to offer is meaningless if you have to endure a considerable number of hours of boring gameplay to get to it.\n\nIf you play the first two SR games, odds are you'll want to see how it ends, and so you will play Defiance regardless of others' opinions, but unlike those two, this is a game you'll probably only play once.

The combat is very flat and samey and the mechanically bland design of enemy types doesn't justify the hordes you have to wade through on every screen. Also if there isn't a law yet against fixed camera angles in 3D games, there needs to be one. But However troubled the gameplay may be, it's never a deal-breaker.\n\nWhere this game shines is where all games of the series shine: storytelling, world-building and voice acting. Once you're invested in the story and you reach the second half of the game, you'll get to experience all the major plotpoints of the final Legacy of Kain entry as well as the conclusion of the whole story. It's worth playing for that alone.\n\nSo I strongly suggest to find a way to play to play Blood Omen 1, Soul Reaver 1, Soul Reaver 2 and Blood Omen 2 in that order and then come back to Defiance.\n","June 22, 2014","true","12.3"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

Ten years ago I've played it without one, and trust me, it's extremely frustrating, where as playing it with a game pad is a totally different feeling.\n\nI have two complaints about the whole game: requiring a controller to play it fluently was a very, very big mistake. It is by far the best game in the series, but it's ruined by this simple fact, and the camera makes matters worse. It becomes confusing when it's facing opposite angles all of a sudden, and at times it seems made especially to drive you insane, even if you are playing it with a controller.\n\nI'm a PC gamer and I don't own any consoles, so I don't see why I would have to own a joystick or a game pad to play a video game from a series that never really required one. Maybe I'm exaggerating...\n\nWell, if you are not bothered by the weird camera and (I emphasize this again) you do have a game controller to play this game with, then you'll be pleased with the story and atmosphere of the final and best game in the series.\n\nUnfortunately, I can only give it a 8 out of 10, because of the frustration brought to me by the camera and controls. It's still a game I recommend if you're a fan of The Legacy of Kain series, though.","January 7, 2015","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimateUlf/recommended/224300/","UltimateUlf","The Ramby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimateUlf/","106 products in account","The last of the released titles in this franchise. One of the best games to see the light of day. Glorious voice acting, superb writing, deep story, and probably the coolest vampire heroes there - Kain and Raziel (and some other, too). It's grim dark vampire fantasy without any of Twillight BS romances and vampire teenagers. The main protagonists are two badasses that handle stuff as real badasses do - with swords, ripping enemies apart. YOU CAN TAKE YOUR ENEMIES SOULS (Raziel does that)!! There also are some other cool characters, like Vorador (another vampire, actually, the first human-turned-vampire guy), Janos Audron (the true blue-skinned vamp) and other dudes.\nThe game definitely aged, the gameplay feels clunky at times (yes, it can be very frustrating to play, especially if you're using a keyboard - strongly recommend having a gamepad to play it), the combat mechanics are a bit repetitive, but still manage to feel satisfying (slamming your enemies to the ground then stabbing them and harvesting their souls to power your sword - sounds pretty satisfying to me).\nThe soundtrack is stunning! Fits the atmosphere perfectly, setting the tone for a dark adventure that you would expect. Sound desing is good, nice ambient sounds that, too, help set the needed atmosphere.\nCamera is one of the weakest points in game: you will get from time to time totally confused and will screw up some platforming if you rush because of it. Stay frosty!\nLevel design is more linear (some levels make you do some backtracking, though still linear: it's point A to B then the point C opens near point A,  for example) compared to previous titles, though puzzles are still there and are fine.\nThe game still holds up even with all the gameplay drawbacks, thanks to exceptional story and voice acting\nLooking for a good vampire game? - Then this is your game\n\n\n","February 6, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no defending it it's just bad and you will have to get used to it, if not you willr egret this purchase. I also highly recommand a gamepad (xbox360 controller works great, just plug and play).\n\nOther than that, this is one of the best action games/platformer ever produced and it has a great storyline (conclusion) to boost! The devs did a colossal job tying up the plot points from Soul Reaver and Boold Omen, witch is saying a lot for those of you wove completed Blood Omen 2. For fans of the series, playing as Kain AND Raziel in the same game is quite pleasing, even if they do control identical. The Reaver puzzles were better done then in the Soul Reaver series, where quite frankly, all you did was push boxes around. Its a lot more action based then its predecessors and using your environment to secure kills is as pleasing as ever.\n\nFor the asking price, its a great buy, an awesome stroll down memory lane and at the end of the day, if you want to know how to Nosgoth saga ends, you have to give this game a go.\n\nPS: Other then the world itself, there is no link between this and the new Nosgoth arena MP game. I do hope this series continues someday. I feel the world of Nosgoth deserves more then a simple storyless arena game. Plus **SPOILER**SPOILER**SPOILER** although Raziel sacrifices himself to the blade at the end, Kain is still well and alive. I could see him rebuilding the vampire empire whilst exchanging quirks with Raziel's soul in the reaver!","February 18, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't find any bugs also\nMhe i rated it above Soul Reaver 2 and Blood Omen 2 and bellow Soul Reaver 1 and Blood Omen 1.\n\nIts also the last of the series T_T o if you played all the others get this ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥.","February 23","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too bad itll be one short since Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen can't make it a complete set.\n\n-A wonderful story, exposition, and ending that makes you feel like you're reading a fantasy novel. The characters are well thought out as well as most of the environments. I really want to take a field trip in the Sarafan Stronghold, The Pillars, and the Vampire Citadel. It feels like spots to just take a break with a book and some tea.\n\n- Playing as both Kain and Raziel were truly an experience as each character's story always seem to intertwine as you journey in the same spots that are spaced out between 500 years.\n\n-The combat mechanics are a little more dynamic than in the previous games, but still pretty meh as there weren't many moves to work with. You can gain EXP to gain a total of 5 combos. So yeah. Dodging a messload of enemies at once becomes a fight for life! You can't go in a beat em up like God of War, they'll ignore that ♥♥♥♥ and give you a hard time.\n\n-The puzzles this time around are a bit more watered down than Soul Reaver 1 and 2, but the game makes it up by using different elemental reavers to solve them. It was fun.\n\n- The Camera. OH MY GOD THE CAMERA. Back during the old days of fixed camera positions in games, this hurt me the most. Every room has it's own fixed point of view and you can only pan the camera's view away. When this happens, I spend 5- 10 seconds trying to find where the hell I am. It's even a pain because it makes the platforming a total illusion. You can't tell how far you are from gliding to another platform until you fall off and start over.  This goes especially wrong with Raziel as with his movement. When you stop, he kind of has some ice physics going on for a brief second.\n\n- Overall: Pretty damn good game. But it's terrible to play with a keyboard and mouse. Get a compatible gamepad.","February 25","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eroldru/recommended/224300/","eroldru","eroldru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eroldru/","293 products in account","The Legacy of Kain series in one of the best and most detailed and intriguing series you could ever play in your life.\nIt has a great gameplay and the music is iconic. The story is so intricate it will take you at least 2-3 playthroughs and being very attentive to dialogues and of course having played the 3 previous games Blood Omen, LOK: Soul Reaver, BO2 (not so relevant, worth playing tho), LOK: SR2. After that you can understand the story and what's going on. This way you will have a better understanding of what the characters are talking about the entire time.\n\nAt first I played the games as a kid. Defiance was played in 2004 by me, shortly after it came out. As a teenager I found vampires very cool and everything, but honestly I could not get half of what they were saying, although I had played SR and SR2 previously. I replayed the game at 28 and I must say, I really enjoy this even after 12 years. The graphics have aged a bit, but they will never make the game,\n\nIf anyone's reading my review I give you two alternatives:\n- Don't play the game. Save yourselves the trouble of getting all the stuff done. If you play the entire series, without including the Blood Omens, it will take you at minimum a good 50-60 hours at first. They are long and the first two SR dialogues are unskippable. You will live your life without having played one of the gems in gaming but you will be calm and carefree.\n\n- Play the game and you will enjoy one of the best written and performed games in the history of gaming. With one of the richest stories ever told. My personal favorite OST in gaming, Fully detailed environments and characters and what not. But the game ends... At a critical point. They have stopped all further developing of the series with like 10 cancelled games. You will not be calm. You will want to see the ending to the story, but there is no ending... THERE IS NO ENDING!\n\nChoose carefully!\nI chose to play the series and I am still tormented. I have replayed every game in the series a lot of times but unfortunately the answer lie not in the past anymore. I have to move on, but I can't. This review is baing written in 2016 after having successfully completed the series one more time. And the ending is as hurtful as always. A black hole, that sucks inside all the rest of the series.\n\nDefiance Review\nPROs:\n- Decent Graphics\n- Amazing Storyline\n- Detailed Characters\n- Intriguing Dialogues\n- Very nice controls\n- Epic OST\n\nCONs:\n- Camera hurts my brain\n- Although epic, most of the OST is recycled from previous games\n\n\nAlthough I have this series, I love this series.\nHistory abhors a paradox...\n","March 7","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
