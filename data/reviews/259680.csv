I'm not really a fan of the genre, though I am a fan of tactical RPGs.  It was only after some interesting comments on another game forum (Grim Dawn, great game, look it up) that I decided to give ToME a try.\n\nUnlike some other rogue-likes, ToME gives you the option to play softcore.  There are varying difficulty levels in addition to different degrees of 'rogue-like-ness' (multiple lives; from 1 to infinite).  The classes vary from basic and simple (Bulwark, Rogue, Archmage, etc) to surprisingly unique (Mindslayer, Oozemancer, Solipsist, etc).  The unlock system can be a pain, but it does encourage you to progress through the game, explore and play various archetypes.\n\nThe lore is great; the world has been excellently crafted (imo).  While it doesn't read like a AAA novel, the depth of the backstory is pretty astonishing considering it's been done primarily by one man (props Darkgod).\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay, everything is surprisingly newbie-friendly (for a rogue-like).  The UI is simple and easy, the controls are variable (keyboard and/or mouse, re-bindable) and the overly-complex item usage often found in the genre has been notably streamlined.\n\nThe graphics are solid.   Now, take that with a grain of salt; this is a 2d game of tiles and sprites.  If you're anticipating something like Dragon Age, you're going to be disappointed.  I know that I was unpleasantly surprised.  That being said, it has definitely grown on me and it certainly gives enough information on what's happening.\n\nAll that being said, this IS a roguelike.  You WILL walk around a corner/open a door/open a chest and get exploded.  Careful, cautious play is highly encouraged.\n\nOverall, if you find yourself wanting to try out a roguelike but finding they are a little too 'hardcore' for you, give ToME a try.  It's the only roguelike that I have found myself returning to, time after time.","November 7, 2014","true","956.2"," 429 of 441 people (97%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","97","429","441","10","6"

This is the first rogue-like game that I've ever played and I was extremely skeptical of the genre before giving TOME a try but I can honestly say that TOME is the best game that I've played in a very, very long time, and as a D&D nerd who grew up in the 80's, this game hits so many of the right notes from an RPG perspective that I have simply not been able to put it down since the summer sale and I've only played 2 out of the like 30 classes.\n\nThe replay value is through the roof and the challenge is out of this world difficult, but like Dark Souls, it mostly feels very fair and does become more manageable as you get better at the game. I can't believe I only paid something like 2$ for this game as it is worth the price of a full AAA title easily. In fact, if I was a developer who had slaved away on a mediocre AAA title this game would make me seriously re-evaluate my life choices. As far as I can tell, this game was developed by one dude, and stands head and shoulders above so many titles that took 100+ people to create that it should serve as an inspiration to hobby game developers everywhere. I can't believe how good this game is, you have to buy it.","August 18, 2015","true","329.6"," 248 of 255 people (97%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","97","248","255","13","9"

This game is for any old school RPG'er that misses great mechanics and gameplay.  I cannot stress enough how engaging this game is.  Anyway, I will list some of the goods and bads of the game.\n\nThe Good\nThe developer, DarkGod, is very attentive to the boards and genuinely is interested in his customers.  This is a positive that is almost nonexistent is most software. (Especially indy stuff.)\nThe choice of characters/classes is vast.  Yes, you have to play to unlock all of them.  That is part of the fun.\nCharacter development is very customizable and detailed.  For me this is a plus, for some this is the source of extreme confusion.\nThe UI is very friendly.  Although, like a lot of the game, it does have a somewhat inclined learning curve.  I have been playing for 60 odd hours and I am still finding ways to use it and new things I didn't know it could do with it.\nThe workshop support is tremendous.  You can customize this game to suit your needs.\nThis is a Rogue Like game that has difficulty settings from casual to hard core.  If you want, you CAN play with unlimited lives.  Or, if you fancy a good challenge, you can play 1 life on crazy difficulty.  The choice is yours.  (I read a few reviews complaining that they died too quick.  So set it on easy and learn to play; it is that simple.)\nTremendous amount of trophies.  One ninth of them are very gettable for anyone. (The trophes are copied nine times for different levels of play.  And, yes, if you do higher level trophies they will get all the same trophies below them.  You just have to do a little dance to have it happen.  If an old fart like me can figure it out (I read posts) then I imagine most people can do the same.)\nThe story is not bad at all.  Far more engaging than most much more expensive games.  If you think it is boring and unimaginative you probably haven't actually read and/or played through much of it.\nThe Bad\nNo, this game is not perfect.  The biggest drawback, from some people's view, is the graphics.  They are very yesterday, yesteryear, last decade possibly.  (For me this is not that big of a deal, I will gladly trade eye-candy for good gameplay.)\nI have experienced some game lag in different parts of the game.  Not sure what causes them, but they are surely there.  I have never had it crash, but I have had to wait 30-90 seconds for it to come out of an apparent mini-freeze.\nThis game can be unflinchingly mean and nasty at higher levels.  For some this is a deal breaker.  For me it is a lot of fun.  So do with that what you want.  (I have read many blog/posts about people rage quitting and never playing again.  For those people...never play Magic the Gathering, you will end up hating life and your friends.)\nThe UI is very friendly.  Although, like a lot of the game, it does have a somewhat inclined learning curve.  Yes, I know this was listed in my "Goods," but it is most definitely a negative for a lot of people.\nKind of gets in the way of life if you get into it.  It is a "just one more turn/zone/thingy type game that will overtake your life if you let it.\nThat is all that I can think of off the top of my head.  I have an old head.  (And, most of the other parts as well.)  So, in closing, get the game.  It is too cheap and well made to not have it in your library.  If this is formatted incorrectly, I humbly apologize for my oldness and lack of modern techno-goodness; it has been years since I "formatted" anything and I imagine quite rusty.\n\n***Sits back and waits to get troll-fired***","April 30, 2015","true","398.2"," 210 of 218 people (96%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","96","210","218","24","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/winwolf/recommended/259680/","winwolf","Winter Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/winwolf/","176 products in account","[posted this initially on the 3rd but reviews were broken at that time.]\n\nI'll start this by telling you that I've been playing TOME since it was Tales of Middle Earth. That's right, originally it was based on Tolkien's work and was an offshoot of a long lineage of games directly related to Rogue, via Moria and then Angband. There was a middle variant in there at some point called Pernband.\n\nSome back story:\nAt some point DarkGod (the main dev) decided to rewrite the client because the old angband client was full of spaghetti code and it became untenable. So came t-engine. Tome was then written as a module of T-engine (all made by DarkGod for no $$ I might add.)\n\nIn Tome 3 there were Jedi!!! and other fun ideas but it was chaotic. Tome 3 was a mess, (Tome 4 was much cleaner.) But it was still pretty opaque as Roguelikes go. I would tinker with it, have fun with lost souls etc and then get bored. So I went the way of many players got involved in other games only came back periodically when I got a yen for playing with Lightsabers again. At some point, I noticed Tome 4 was progressing and downloaded and everything was different.\n\nGone were most of the touches of the Angband and Tolkien worlds. You can still see a few here and there but TOME had become Tales Of Maj Eyal with an original story and a total reworking of the graphics and mechanics. On and off Ive done some beta testing (though my forums account from then was deleted more than once so I guess being inactive on the forums is a good way to get culled.)\n\nAt some point I managed a couple of end games. I won once and once I sacrificed my guy (I still don't know why that doesn't count as a win...)\n\nEvery time I came back more and more stuff was added and then I saw that they had finally made the leap to Steam. I wanted to buy it immediately because I believe in the game and the devs and why not support them? But I was reticent with all the other games I have and also had to wait for money to pay for it anyway.\n\nI probably should not have waited but I did and when I did finally get the steam version I was not disappointed with either the basic game or the DLC (which I had no previous knowledge of.)\n\nDivergent note that tangentially relates to this review:\nBob Dylan has said on songwriting that if you can't change a song, if you can't mess with the words or change the arrangements it is dead and you should bury it. That is a paraphrase because I don't have the exact quote on hand. But this is how I feel about games. TOME is a living game, always changing.\n\nMany pay to play games are not. They merely make some stuff they took out initially available for DLCs when the wells run dry. TOME is not like those games. TOME is developed by a caring group of dedicated players and programmers who are making an epic play experience.\n\nYes epic. You have a ton of races and classes which unlock as you play. Sometimes the unlock is just something you were going to do anyway but sometimes in true RPG fashion you have to investigate and figure out some puzzle or quest to get the unlock you want. And you can unlock them in something like 9 different modes. The game offers 50 levels of experience in whatever build combo you choose. As you learn more about classes and races you find yourself getting deeper into the decision making process and you realize you have many more choices than you will quickly be able to play with. This could take a long time. As is without any further changes. And the game changes from game to game so you may not always get an event or area you thought you might. And different play styles create vastly different approaches and in-game storylines.\n\nThere was a lot of discussion when Maj'Eyal became the world of the game about how terribly difficult the game was (is) so now there are multiple modes for discovering the game. The most rewarding depends on your personality and proclivities as a gamer. You can play with Easy and Exploration and virtually never risk death, or you can unlock, insanity and madness modes and play only in true Roguelike fashion (1 life, though there are items you can find to hedge that bet.) Or you could play as I do on Normal with Adventurous. To each player their own. This is an innovation I wish more devs would think about. Multiple play modes for multiple types of players means more fun for everyone.\n\nThe game has a few pit falls. It is deep so it is not hard to get into trouble if you are tired, hungry or bored. Don't do that. Play when you are fresh and excited and keep it that way. You won't complete it in a day. (The main quest line takes a minimum of 10 hours I think if you skip everything else and I highly recomend you don't do that.)\n\nYou may also find that the game lore is hard to penetrate. This is partially due to writing style and partially because who wants to read so much of it? Yes you should read the lore the first time you encounter it at the very least. You may or may not glean valuable clues from it but if you need to you can go back to it later. Once you have unlocked certain features you will be able to access ALL of the lore you've ever seen as a player.\n\nYou may notice that I am not giving a lot of specifics here because part of the fun of this game is playing it unspoiled. You can of course look stuff up or ask for spoilers if you aren't into all that.\n\nI will say the sound effects while fairly professional are not my cup of tea. I am not really a game sounds kind of player though. I typically turn sound off in games I play and I only checked them out in TOME out of curiousity. You might find them entertaining. Apparently, also there is music. Something I didn't check out. (I am an older guy with a very staid taste in music. If it isn't Classic Rock. Folk, Blues or Soul from the 60s-70s then it probably isn't on my mp3 player. Though I do enjoy more varied styles, when I am gaming that's mainly what I listen to.)\n\nI write all this mainly to enthuse about how much I am enjoying playing TOME again and want you to know it is worth every penny to buy it on steam.  The community addons alone make the game extremely customizable.\n\nGandolfo in game chat, Winter Wolf on Steam.","March 4, 2015","true","390.9"," 209 of 222 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","209","222","6","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/recommended/259680/","Mittsies","Mittsies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mittsies/","72 products in account","If you're already a roguelike fan, chances are you've played this game - and probably enjoyed it. So for the purposes of this review I'm going to assume you're had little to no experience with traditional roguelikes, and perhaps some experience with "Roguelites" such as Binding of Isaac, FTL, Rogue Legacy, Risk of Rain, or Spelunky (not an exhaustive list). These games share some similarities with more traditional roguelikes in that they feature procedural level generation, perma-death and often have steep difficulty curves... but are blended with other genres such as platformer or top-down action. Tales of Maj'Eyal is, however, a more traditional roguelike due to the way you control your character.\n\nTurn-based games are typically seen as boring and time-consuming for obvious reasons, but in ToME (and in many other traditional roguelikes) everything is literally instantaneous. You can take turns as quickly as you want, you can move your character and issue commands as fast as you and your computer can process. There is no waiting for fancy character animations to finish playing. Enemies move as you move, so you don't need to wait for them to take a turn. In fact, something I love about ToME is that there is essentially no 'grinding'. You level up, you find items, you go through the game in a mostly linear fashion (although you can choose which order you do dungeons in), but around every corner awaits the possibility of death. Whether you are level 1 or maxed out, there is a potential for you to die if you make a mistake.\n\nToME is a tactical strategy game at heart. Very few deaths will happen because of bad luck, most of them will be a result of mistakes (usually a series of them). This is made possible because there is a plethora of escape options and vision scouting abilities, ensuring that luck plays no part in your experience. As you play you will encounter 'rare' monsters which have a wider range of abilities than most, often requiring you to play very carefully and think out every move you make. Excluding your primary damage-dealing abilities, nearly every ability your character has is for a unique purpose: faster movement, teleports, swapping positions, stunning, healing, shielding, evading, removing effects, and so on. Character positioning and knowing when and how to use your skills is the key to sucess in this game.\n\nThe basic gameplay is solid due to the strategy elements, but the variety of character customization and items you can find is where the real excitement comes from. There's quite a lot of different classes and races to choose from, many of which have very unique playstyles. Each character's passive and active abilities can be leveled up point-by-point so you can customize exactly what they're capable of, and you cannot max out everything so you must decide what works best for you. As you progress into the game, you'll find items with a huge list of modifiers and special traits. You will constantly be comparing two items and thinking about which is better, especially weapons. How much base damage a weapon deals is rarely the deciding factor in whether or not you will use it, as each individual item can have dozens of different effects and stat changes you to consider. The level of customization depth adds an incredible amount of replay value to the game.\n\nThe game's aesthetics, however, are not great. I mean the graphics are decent... for a roguelike, a genre that is often associated with graphics consisting of colored ascii characters and nothing else. But I won't beat around the bush on this one: the graphics look pretty bad when compared to almost anything else. And I don't just mean low quality, I mean the art style is terrible. Generic uninspired fantasy crap. The screen is often cluttered with ugly doodads and bulky objects, enemy sprites look ridiculous, I honestly feel most people will take one look at the game and go "This game looks like trash. I am not playing that." - and I don't blame you. I just hope you can look past the terrible aesthetics to find the beautiful game within. You know, inner beauty.\n\nAbove all, ToME is free. You can download the full base game from their website, and if you enjoy it you can purchase a copy of it on steam (or throw the developer a direct donation). The game is consistently updated, has full mod support, and has an website that tracks all of your character data and allows you to look up other players to compare. Although the base game is free, ToME has a couple of DLC 'expansion packs' that are only available for purchase, but these are HUGE content packs for people who love the base game and want more stuff to tinker with.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who has enough patience to get past the learning curve.\nRating: A","December 14, 2015","true","163.5"," 148 of 157 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","148","157","9","8"

Even the achievements have sometimes the best names I've ever seen ("I cleared the room of death and all I got was this lousy achievement!")\n- Death.

Now, from that roguelike take out the fact that: Potions can kill you, necklaces can choke you, weapons can weld themselves to your hand, Identify scrolls can be burned to a crisp, and you can be violently killed by eating moldy bread :)\n\nWhile I love those type of deaths, once you play ToME and notice that those deaths are not there, you realize now that if you die, it truly is your fault. Death comes from combat (or the occasional sandworm burrow collapsing in on you, haha), and the combat is great.. Almost every single build has multiple ways you can grow, almost to the point that they play like different classes altogether when raised in certain ways.. And then the raw variety of classes is amazing as well.. And the random loot generation is some of the best I've dealt with on the MANY, MANY random-loot games I've played :>\n\nAdd to all that the Infinite Dungeon (how far can you go?), the Transmogrification Chest (all picked-up items rest weightlessly inside the Transmog Chest, and on changing floors you can auto-sell everything out of the chest for a 10% cash penalty, makes inventory management a breeze), a very active and friendly playerbase with in-game chat (its basically an IRC room tacked to the bottom right of the game), the ability to link items and enemies through chat to share the joy of good loot, or the bitter terror of a hyper-strong unique enemy, semi-random in-game events that can potentially save you from the brink of death, and more.. :>\n\nThis game has the most achievements of any game on Steam (over 1000), multiple difficulty levels (some that determine the strength of your foes, others that determine how many lives you get: Roguelike one-life-to-live, Adventure 5-lives-to-live, and Exploration mode, unlimited lives with which you can get comfortable with the game ((or plunge fearlessly into the Infinite Dungeon!)\n\nAnyway.. Try it.. It won't suck out your everlasting human soul, I promise.. It won't.. consume.. you.. GOTTA GO PLAY ToME!

It's quite forgiving for the genre.  It's not nearly as spoiler-heavy as Nethack or ADOM, and while it doesn't have the same "transparency" as Dungeon Crawl, it tends to be a little easier.  There is a multiple-life "adventure" mode which can be turned off.  There are essentially no consumables in the game; the roles typically filled by these are instead unlimited-use abilities subject to cooldowns after use.\n\nOne interesting feature is that if you log in to play, there is an in-game chatroom.  The online population rarely reaches above 200, so the chatroom isn't actually too cluttered.  I have frequently seen developers online answering questions/taking bug reports.\n\nThis game is available for free on the developer's website, but there is one class and a few other minor features that are only available in the paid version.","October 29, 2014","true","65.3"," 69 of 75 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","69","75","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/259680/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Wouldn't it be nice to have an RPG you could just play forever? To have a huge, randomized world to explore, hundreds of enemies to battle, nigh infinite loot to find, and dozens upon dozens of characters to try? Tales of Maj'Eyal certainly tries to be just that, and if you can get past some balance and aesthetic hangups, you might get your wish.\n\nToME, as I'm going to abbreviate it from here on, is a roguelike RPG of incredible scale. Right from character creation, you have dozens of combinations of races and classes to choose from, with more to unlock as you explore the world. There's plenty of exploring to do across said massive world as well, what with the layout of the continents and dungeons randomized each time. Enemies and loot are even more randomized, scattered throughout in ways that encourage you to explore every nook and cranny of every level of every dungeon. There are towns to visit and NPCs to take quests from, and though the main story quest is the same every time, your start and some elements later are determined by your race and your class.\n\nEvery time you start a new character, you're in for a dramatically different adventure, just as you would expect from a quality roguelike. Right from the start there's a huge amount of variance between the classes. You have everything from different flavors of warriors and archers to exotic professions like chronomancers and abominations. Leveling up gains you new stat points to spend, skill points in two separate classes of skills, and occasionally the chance to learn entirely new skills. Coupled with the ridiculous amount of loot to find, there's a lot of customizing to do, and dozens of skills to use on a single character between their class skills, racial skills learned skills, runes, infusions, and item-granted powers.\n\nIf all this sounds overwhelming, it really isn't because of how the game is played. ToME is turn-based at your pace, meaning things only happen when you move or attack. Attacking can be as simple as bumping into enemies to auto attack, or laying out combinations of skills over dozens of turns. And this is where the balance starts to become an issue, because for most fights you'll be doing the former. Most enemies in ToME are little more than filler, assuming you've been diligent in exploring and leveling. Despite the vast array of enemies to battle, many present little challenge. It's the rare unique enemies and ones with certain devastating abilities you have to watch out for, and in stark contrast with the rest of your foes these can end your life in one or two turns. Every single character I have lost has been to an unexpected boss or unique that wrecked me instantly after cleaving effortlessly through their minions.\n\nTo its credit, ToME has a wide assortment of difficulty settings, and the default level gives you several lives to experiment with before succumbing to permadeath. But it's a band-aid on a much deeper balance wound. Most of the adventuring in ToME presents so little challenge you can run on autopilot, until suddenly dying to the one thing in the room that poses a threat. This creates a strange whiplash effect between mounting boredom and sudden frustration. And the methods for overcoming a challenging boss won't always be clear thanks to the immense volume of stats and abilities that you normally don't have to keep much track of. Even after a dozen hours it can be hard for me to tell what my character is ready for.\n\nThe result is a game that's not too daunting to get into, but presents a real challenge to master. Every attempt is a long and gratifying series of small discoveries and victories before the inevitable end comes. There's plenty of unique items, new classes, and lore to uncover even if beating the game isn't in the cards. I still haven't come close to whatever the end is, but after 20 hours I'm still not tired of the meat grinder. Maybe I really can play this forever, and even if you can't, you'll get a lot of quality adventuring out of it.","December 21, 2015","true","21.0"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","54","58","3","0"

I love it.\n\nTons of content, and it's even free. I must have played like 200 hours before acquiring it on steam, because DarkGod deserves the money, and a game like this for this low price is almost a steal,\n\nThe game starts out being relatively simple to play, with few races and classes avaliable, and few complicated mechanics, but as you progress in your runs and do different stuff, you unlock interesting new races and classes.\n\nHell, you can time travel. TIME. TRAVEL.\n\nOne of the best parts is that, in order to unlock classes and races, you have to do some pretty interesting things. For example, unlocking mages requires that you find the existence of mages, and some important finds affect later playthroughs, like finding the anti-magic people of Zigur or a certain chest that once you find all your characters start with.\n\nThis game is so awesome, that it helped me stay sane during a week of post-surgery lying face-down on a hospital bed.\n\nI reccomend this. Seriously, if you like roguelikes and don't mind text, give this a try for free at te4's page, and I strongly reccomend buying it, it barely gives you features, mostly cosmetic ones, but something of this scale deserves a purchase, and for this price, it is well worth it.\n\nI love it.","September 26, 2014","true","235.1"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","51","57","4","0"

You can try it for free from DarkGod's website (just search for tome of mag'eyal on google, and it should be the first link). Being a Steam addict, I'm glad it is available here however (I might not have discovered it otherwise). I enjoyed it so much after the first 6 hours, I donated 20 Euros on the website. I've already seen enough of this game to know I well get AT LEAST that much enjoyment. Obviously DarkGod believes in his game as well, otherwise it wouldn't be free to try as much as you like.

ToME is an incredibly deep and strategic RPG/roguelike which takes place in an insanely lore-rich world of classic high fantasy.\n\nThe game is strategic in that time moves in "turns", meaning time ceases to move between actions or movements. This allows you to carefully plan each action, rather than requiring twitch reflexes. If you want fast paced action, look elsewhere. Animation is minimal, yet the graphics are extemely charming, and convey quite clearly everything that is happening.\n\nCharacter creation is rich, deep, and super flexible, albeit extremely complex. I've played the same class a million times, but the result is always different depending on how I lay out the stats and skill points, which is probably my favorite part. I am constantly finding fun and oddball builds which get a million times farther than I expect. If you like making characters for tabletop rpgs you'll love this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty brutal, but it always feels fair. There are ways to turn this down for chickens, or up farther for masochists and vets. As you play, you get better at making characters and becoming better at survival. But there are a TON of things to unlock too. There are different classes, races, and starting items to unlock in addition to "campaigns", which are essentially different game modes. If you get bored of adventuring around the continent, turn on endless dungeon mode. Tired of that? Arena mode is a blast too.\n\nBasically, this game is insanely fun, super challenging (and therefore rewarding), and the world is written with a very tasteful degree of seriousness. Humor can be found in dialogue but it is subtle and never breaks the immersion (no memes thank the lord.)\n\nIf you enjoy roguelikes and don't have this game, do yourself a favor and cop it! If you like it, go get that dlc too.

A quick review of its pros/cons :\n\n+ amazing choice  of classes, each with a very different gameplay\n+ 3 different game modes : story, arena, infinite dungeons (the last 2 are to unlock by playing the 1st)\n+ 5 different difficulties, and 3 ways to play : exploration (infinite lives), adventure (finite number of lives), roguelike (1 life)\n+ old-school graphics, slightly "enhanced", which usually do a wonderful job\n+ nice background music, for the most part\n+ very deep and smart system, with tons of modifiers, stats and talents to look after\n+ you can play it as slowly or as fast as you want\n+ playable with mouse only, keyboard only, or a mix of both, as you wish\n+ functional and scalable UI\n+ tons of lore if you're into reading ;)\n\n- some graphic tiles are a little messy (thinking of the glittering caves, or whatever they're called, for example), making some dungeons a bit tough to "read"\n- the UI, while overall nice, could be better : overalapping texts, annoying popups, and item comparisons which are frequently a mess to analyse\n- do NOT buy this game if you're looking for an easy 100% achievements :D There are 1395 achievements, most of them require to play at least 9 times, and they don't fall that easily, most of the time (case in point : I have 91 achievements after 67 hours of game time, lol). These obviously could have be done better, like for example automatically unlock lesser difficulties ones when you achieve one (what's the point of doing the same achievement on normal if you just got it on insane ?)\n- a few crashes (mostly when starting a new game or loading one, strangely : I don't remember having a crash while in game)\n- it is possible to get stuck : on my last infinite dungeons run, I ended up in a "corner" where the door disappeared (on purpose) and the walls were not diggable. As I had not found any teleportation means yet, my only option was to suicide (target my talents at myself). If it was on "roguelike" mode, it would have been a game over.\n\nYou can get hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of playtime with this game, if it appeals to you, without ever being bored. Personnally, I'm a bit burnt out after nearly 70h, but I'll probably come back to it later, if I ever find the time.\n\nNot only recommended, but almost mandatory for every gamer who likes rpgs, dungeon crawlers or roguelikes :)","December 20, 2015","true","74.6"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","33","34","2","4"

All too often, they throw a million different obtuse mechanics at you, including but not limited to hunger (discouraging exploration), unidentified items (discouraging the collection of loot, which serves as a major incentive to crawl a dungeon to begin with), or cursed items (discouraging the use of higher quality gear because you'll never be able to unequip it, or equipping it literally kills you)\n\nDarkGod (the developer of the game) decided to try something different, here. Understanding that mechanics like cursed items and hunger are relics of the past, he did away with them. This entire game, conceptually speaking, takes a good, hard look at what makes other roguelikes unapproachable messes and tries to understand what the real meat of the genre is, and he has spent years polishing his vision to a fine shine.\n\nDarkGod has given you a a huge variety of archtypes, each with their own subclasses that specialize in one thing or another. Simple "bump" based combat that dominates other games in the genre has been replaced with a rich skill system that encourages you to carefully consider not only the positions of yourself and your enemies, but what skills to use in order to ensure your survival. Rather than relying on hard to find or expensive to purchase consumable items, you will find "runes" and "inscriptions" that are infinitely re-usable, but come with a cooldown, demanding that you make strategic use of them. The skill tree system forces you to make careful decisions in regards to pumping skills that make it easier to not die, or pumping skills that make it easier for you to kill enemies, which is itself another valid form of survival. Many skills combo together in ways that you can't easily imagine, which, if you slow down and take enough time to think it through, a situation which appears hopeless at first glance can be turned around through sheer determination and enough tactical thought.\n\nI will readily admit that I am not well versed enough in the genre to elaborate any further on what this game does better than its competitors. But I do know that I have avoided playing roguelikes for years because of obtuse mechanics, and this game did away with enough of them to captivate me for dozens of hours already, and will almost certainly rob me of even more of my time as the days go on. If you've played games such as Nethack, Pixel Dungeon, Desktop Dungeons, or Dungeons of Dredmor and were turned off by them, I believe this game is accessible enough to be worth giving a shot, even if you have otherwise given up on the genre.","May 22, 2015","true","84.9"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"

Now it's time to write a review... wait, gotta buy the DLC first... including the one that doesn't do anything, to support the dev. I felt like a criminal for how much I paid for ToME from the start...\n\nOk, done. Now... where was I?\n\nOh, the review. I paid 10 times more (each) for 2 or 3 games during summer sale than I paid for Maj, just a couple of days before getting it. What happened was I didn't play any of the others (AAA stuff) once after I started ToME, and now I'm writing this review while thinking about what class to play next.\n\nIf you haven't played any game like this one before, and by looking at the screenshots feel like it doesn't look (literally) good enough for you, keep in mind that the point is: while it doesn't have the fancy, modern graphics, it does right everything most games these days do wrong-- everything that makes it a GAME is great.\n\nI'll try to keep it short:\n\nRoguelike - It is, but on Adventure mode you get about 7 lives (+some items you may find that can resurrect you once). You can go hardcore, 1-life Roguelike if you want.\n\nRaces/Classes - Several of them, unlockable. I'm still missing 5. They are very different from each other, with many different and interesting skill trees. You gotta put some thinking into figuring out what you are gonna make and how you are going to build it.\n\nItems - Diablo-like, random drops and attributes, different rarity and tier levels. You feel the thrill of finding good loot. Lots of uniques too. You can stash them and retrieve with another/new character, boosting them hard on your future playthroughs. Just 3 at a time tho, which is annoying, but you can re-do it as many times as you want and so distribute any number of items between your dudes.\n\nMap/Dungeons - Always the same dungeons, but spawning on random locations across the map and with randomized interiors. Some minor events and sub-dungeons are also randomly generated.\n\nQuests - Not a lot of them, always the same, but some are very interesting and give nice rewards.\n\nLore - LOTS of lore scrolls to be found, telling the game's universe story. I didn't read them, I never do, I don't have the patience, but if you like immersing yourself a bit deeper, you won't have a problem with that.\n\nElite/Rare/Unique/Boss Monsters - These are the ones who usually take those 7 lives away from you... along with the rare multihued wyrms... and magic wielders... and map encounters...  and everything else if you are a Mage.\n\nGameplay - You gotta build your character right, position yourself right, pay attention, have an escape plan... some parts are really though until you get a good hang of the game-- which is great, and a good part of the fun.\n\nGraphics/Sound - They work perfectly, the visual effects are nice and the music is pretty good.\n\nBugs/Crashes - I got 3 in 63 hours. Fixed a "0 turn duration skill" by going back to the main menu and then continuing the game, fixed both crashes by clicking "Close" on the in-game dump note. I had to kill one of my temporal hounds on the second one though, otherwise the dumps kept coming, but it was easily fixed.\n\nThis is a great game, awesome cost/benefit. I'm usually skeptical about old-school graphics, but they don't take anything away from ToME, and this baby does very well what most modern games screw up - the part that really matters.\n\nAnd now... I'm going Paladin next. To see if I can get that holy gentleman past the freaking Master...\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy paladin died on the last boss fight. I'm still mourning him... and specially all the good stuff he took along to his grave. I honestly hope he is in hell.\n\nDoombringer, the DLC class, is awesome.\n\nI also found out I'm not man enough to face the Atamathon.\n\nOn the downside, Temporal Hounds always end up glitching somehow (and Time Warden is the s**t, my best dude). I had to edit and repack some of the game's files to fix one of them. It worked, but required some effort. And now, doing the Prides on Nightmare with that very same TW, the game began freezing hard, forcing me to reopen it to keep going every 20 minutes or so.\n\nSo... avoid Temporal Hounds if you can. I can't, I like puppies. On the other hand, I didn't have any problems whatsoever with the other classes... my summoner (who spawned a lot more stuff than 3 dogs) worked fine until he got ♥♥♥♥♥ by The Master.","June 21, 2015","true","205.6"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","32","34","2","1"

The loot system is similar to Diablo and other ARPGs, with randomly generated loot of various qualities and special effects, along with unique loot. The art style is similar to old-school western RPGs like the Spiderweb games. An overworld map contains various towns and dungeons, the latter of which unlock gradually as you progress and complete quests.\n\nNow, the part where this game really defied my expectations is that it provides a very streamlined experience, without a lot of the typical drudgery that goes along with games like this.\n\n- First of all, the game itself is very intuitive to pick up and start playing without needing a tutorial. The interface is mouse-driven, no need to memorize keybinds (although it does offer fully customizable keybinds as well).\n\n- The game seem to understand that the appeal of games like this is both the satisfaction of level progression, as well as the hunt for rare loot. Early on, you get an item that can recycle junk loot into gold, as well as a item with unlimited charges that basically provides a Town Portal effect that teleports you out of the current dungeon. This eliminates the trap that Bethesda games, for example, typically fall into, where you want to be a packrat and collect every piece of loot you come across, but are severely limited in the amount of weight you can carry.\n\n- The game offers several difficulty levels, from unlimited lives, to several lives, to permadeath.\n\n- The game has an "auto-explore" button, where your character will automatically move around the current dungeon floor until it finds an item of interest or an enemy. Movement can also be control via clicking on visible locations, and your character will move to the select square.","April 8, 2014","true","13.8"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","1"

It is 2D and turn based, preferring gameplay and depth over graphical wizardry.\n\nOne important distinction between TOME and other roguelikes is the lack of emphasis on procedural generation. TOME actually has a plot, one that spans continents and the void between worlds, a story of darkness, magic and of course world domination. Throughout each playthrough, the story is the same, albeit with some slight alterations/additions depending on the actions you take and the starting class you select. There is a world map, and the major story locations do not change. Although the layout of each dungeon is procedurally generated, this is not empasised as a selling point of the game - it is merely a tool used to highlight the other qualities this game possesses. And boy are there a lot of qualities.\n\nFirst and foremost - the character classes. Good luck finding a more comprehensive, deep and exciting set of classes in any other roguelike, or any other GAME for that matter. TOME has over 15 of these, ranging from the stalwart Bulwark to the insidious Shadowblade to the righteous Sun Paladin, TOME has you covered for any kind of playstyle you wish to try. Each class then has a vast array of talent branches to follow, and the branches you choose to develop will essentially create a subset of the class you have chosen. The customisation possibilities are massive, resulting in a lot of replayability and tactical flexibility.\n\nCombat is a highly tactical turn based affair, with a strong emphasis on positioning, cooldowns, and your innate knowledge of your own abilities versus your opponent's. Once within your view, every enemy you encounter can be right-clicked on to view their statistics, abilities (passive and active) and resistances. There are no consumables in TOME. The use of each of your skills and items works on a cooldown system, and managing these cooldowns effectively will make the difference between you slaying a boss or becoming a small stain on a tower floor.\n\nAnd believe me, the latter will happen far more often than the former if you're not prepared, because TOME is HARD. Hard as in one-hit-kill hard. Hard as in the game gives you 3 options - Rogulike (1 life), Adventure (gain lives as you level up) and Exploration (infinite lives) - and taking the Roguelike option early on will result in tears. Hard as in some of the more powerful enemies in the game are comprised of two separate random character classes, and God help you if you face one with two even remotely synergistic classes under its belt.\n\nAnd to be honest, if there's one thing that drives me nuts about TOME, it is the difficulty. No doubt this makes me a console casual, but I'm serious. The difficulty of TOME is not embedded within the general gameplay, such as a game like Dark Souls, but rather in its frightening inconsistency of enemy threat. The existence of enemies with randomly combined abilities, together with the fact that there are over 10 different damage types (Fire Cold Darkness Light Mind Temporal Blight Nature bleh) means that at some point (normally after you've spent 10 minutes breezing through a horde of useless trash mobs) you will suddenly bump into a Godlike terror that sends you screaming into the abyss of death with a single, sloppy blink, simply due to having the perfect storm of resistances, abilities and relative level that results in a big tick in the Rekt column. Despite my affection for this wonderful, deep and mechanically interesting game, it is also by far the game I have rage-quitted the most.\n\nTL:DR Version....\n\nGood - Excellent character classes, tactical combat and involving storyline.\n\nBad - Insane difficulty spikes\n\nOverall - if you enjoy a good tough roguelike, you should already have this game!","October 10, 2014","true","328.4"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","1"

Rather importantly the designer has not been afraid to throw out poor features - potions are replaced by limited cooldowns, hunger clock doesn't exist, no item identification, etc. It's so focussed, and because it's so focussed it goes into extreme depth in producing a complex and interesting experience.\n\nThere's a good reason this has won Roguelike of the Year for many years running - it's simply the best there is, in a class of its own.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paintedindigo/recommended/259680/","paintedindigo","paintedindigo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paintedindigo/","431 products in account","A very good introduction to classical roguelikes. TOME streamlines some things while keeping true to the formula of old school games like Nethack, ADOM, and Brogue. There's a free version that's basically the same as the paid version - you can download it from the TOME website if you're not sure you want to buy this yet.\n\nTOME has automatic identification. You also get an item called a transmogrification chest, which basically cashes out your loot while you're still in the dungeon - reducing the risk of overencumbrance or loot saturation. TOME also has a modern engine and tileset, although the tileset is rather ugly. Most importantly for new players, there are five difficulty settings and three permadeath settings. The permadeath settings are especially useful, because they provide the option to 1) explore with unlimited lives, 2) play the game as intended, but with limited lives, and 3) play with permadeath like a true roguelike.\n\nWhile it has convenience features, TOME is still an old school roguelike. Beating it without spoilers is a large undertaking, although not as difficult as Nethack. The different dungeons/areas are all different types of difficulty and as a level one character you might wander into a powerful monster's lair and get immediately annihilated. This is the kind of game where you'll need a wiki open most of the time if you're not a masochist.\n\nTOME is also very feature-complete. Not only is there a standard story/open-world mode, but there is also an arena and endless dungeon. The Steam Workshop opens up modding opportunities. There is a huge amount of lore (my estimate so far is at least the length of a full book). There are lots of classes, many of which only become avaiable to you once you've reached a certain point in the game, which ensures there's always something fresh. It has over a thousand achievements, which is the highest out of any game on Steam (when it first came out Steam couldn't even handle it, the devs had to work with Valve for a few weeks to get them working properly).\n\nOne thing that really spices up the game for me is the ability to play as anti-magic. There's a faction in the world of TOME that is violently opposed to arcane magic. You can join them as long as you don't use any arcane magical items or cast spells. It's not as much of a challenge as it seems because there are non-arcane "natural" enchantments too, so anti-magic is a valid choice for story, roleplaying, or gameplay variation. It makes melee classes quite a bit more interesting and immersive.\n\nI highly recommend Tales of Maj'Eyal for people who are interested in getting into classic roguelikes, or old roguelike fans who want to play something newer.","July 21, 2015","true","15.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","21","21","0","0"

However, I have yet to play a game compelling enough to make me want to take the time to write a review; until now.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal is a rare kind of game. On the surface, it doesn't look like much, but there is so much depth and complexity to this game, its simple appearance doesn't do it any justice (not that there is anything wrong with the appearance). I say this is rare because I feel that most games do the opposite; they may have amazing visuals, but often fall short when it comes to depth and complexity. Visuals don't hold my interest very long if the game doesn't have much else to offer. What it lacks in visuals, it makes up for in mechanics.\n\nThis game is a rogue-like RPG, but it changes a few things up. For one, there is no need to eat. Some may argue that this detracts from the rogue-like experience, and normally I would probably agree, but I feel that this game is more focused on the tactical combat aspect as opposed to the survival aspect, and I commend it in that regard. Another difference is the lack of potions. Instead of potions, which require farming to replenish, this game uses something called inscriptions, in the form of runes or infusions. These inscriptions fill the same role as potions, but they operate on a cooldown instead of being limited-use, effectively eliminating any need for farming potions, which is a fantastic idea, in my opinion.\n\nThe game is difficullt. You will die, a lot. At the time of writing this review, I have 376.8 hours under my belt and I have only beaten the game once, but I don't plan on giving up any time soon. One thing that makes the unforgiving nature of the game more bearable are the persistent unlocks. When you first boot up the game, you will have a relatively limited selection of birth options, in the form of races and classes. As you play, you unlock more birth options permanently, in addition to unlocking new game modes and even skill trees. There is a ton of replayability here.\n\nThe developers of this game are consistently polishing the game and considering feedback from the community. A cool feature of this game is an in-game chat room where you can ask for tips, discuss strategies, and talk directly to developers. It's a great feature and is probably the closest thing to multiplayer we will see in a game like this. You can tell that the developers poured their blood, sweat, and tears into this game to make something exceptional. And they have succeeded.\n\nThis game is nearly perfect in my eyes. It is an exemplary rogue-like, and although it does some things a little differently, it does them extremely well. It has come such a long way and gets better every day. Do not hesitate if you are on the fence. Send me a personal message and I will convince you. This game is worth every penny and the developers deserve support for the great work that they do.\n\n10/10 Would get clobbered into troll soup again.\n\nTLDR; Buy this game.","May 13","true","378.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

Nethack? Roguelikes? Old cRPGs?\nTales of Maj'Eyal could something you are looking for.\n\nToME offers a wonderfully diverse cast of races/classes and various difficulties to play on, providing high replayability.\nEach race/class provides a unique assortment of skills and abilities talents that are all chosen as you progress and level-up through out the game, allowing you to effectively be in control of the strength and development of your character.\n\nThe graphics are very remenant of old-school rpg gaming with some new polish added in.\nI find the style of graphics and presentation to be one of the endearing and strong aspects of ToME.\nthe simple gaming feel with a complex system in root, where your success is uniquely determined by your choices, actions, and strategies.\n\nAs a roguelike at its heart, death in game is no stranger.  Sometimes it comes a bit quickly and unexpectedly.\nOther times you can see your mistakes play out and see where things could have gone better.\nDeath is a natural course of the gameplay, but each subsequent playthrough provides an opportunity to hone your tactics or knowledge to help your next character out.\nYou are rewarded for learning from mistakes and improving your strategies, I feel this is one of the defining strengths for ToME.\nYou can however play with extra lives if perma-death is a bit daunting =)\n\nThe asking price of $6.99 is extremely generous in my book, as i have spent ten times more money for AAA games and have often played them a fraction of the time that i have spent on ToME.\n\nI very highly recommend Tale's of Maj'Eyal anyone who is a fan of older style rpgs, tactical combat, or rewarding skill systems.","July 9, 2015","true","075.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Small price, small download size, but BIG fun!  It's a nice looking tile set roguelike RPG with a tactical turn-based combat system.  I suggest not using the 'auto-explore' feature so you can get the sense of actually lurking around and wondering what's around the corner, or behind the next door.  Surprisingly enough, you'll come face to face with rare mobs on a fairly regular basis with nice loot, but they're not just going to hand them over to you.  No Siry Bob....you'll have to take it from his/her/it's cold-dead, clawing/oozing/hairy or whatever type of hand.\nLots of choices on the type of character you want to play, and you actually unlock more options of all kinds to make your next play characters even better or to try something completely different.  Don't worry, you'll be playing more characters you can count on it.  You can only die so many times, if at all, before your character goes bye-bye to the beyond.  Just use his death as a great excuse to try out that new unlocked race/class/gear or whatever.\nAnyways, try it out, I'm sure some of you will be caught off-guard by how fun and good the game is for it's download size and price as I mentioned.\nOh and forgot to say something for achievement fans.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExplosiveOdyessy/recommended/259680/","ExplosiveOdyessy","Odyessy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExplosiveOdyessy/","246 products in account","Ahh, Tales Of Maj'Eyal. What is there to say about it? Well--\n\n-Odyessy was hit for 50 nature, 50 temporal, 30 fire-\n\n-Killed-\n\nOw.\n\nTales Of Maj'Eyal\n~Spoiler Free Review!~\n--------NOTE---------\n\nThis review is based off the majority of my play with mods. For around 90% of my hours on the game, I have spent it with mods. I shall list what mods I used at the bottom of the review, but none are extreme enough to change any of the core concepts of the game. The mods I've used made information easier to understand.\n\nOooh boy. I absolutely love this game. I really, really do. If I had to pick a single game to bring with me into, say, Space, this game would be my pick, hands down.\n\nCommunityYou know what's strange for a Rouge-lite game? Having encouragement to directly talk with the community. Yeah, strange, isn't it? Whenever you're in the game, and you're online...you're connected to the community with a button-press away. There's a window on your screen (that isn't intrusive) where people's achievements within the game and conversations are. You can link items and monsters you find to show off to others the items you've found, or to ask for strategies on creatures you've never faced before. I do reccomend a mod called "Die In Obscurity" so you don't see how every single person dies. It can overflow the chat at times. Afraid of spoilers from the community? No problem! The moment someone types something that's considered spoilerly, they will be sent to ToME Spoiler Chat. It's an automatic system, so you won't even see a glance of spoilers. I've NEVER had a issue with the community, and have had quite a few conversations with the dev himself, Darkgod. The moderators are absolutely awesome as well! Good on all of you!\n\nSo, yes, this is indeed a positive for the game. I encourage you, as well, to take part in the community!\n\n\nCombatI'll talk about the story in a bit, but I believe this is to be the BIGGEST draw to the game. The combat.\n\nYou see, Tales Of Maj'Eyal is complex. This, sadly, can be a heavy drawback for those who would rather actually enjoy it. In every single turn (every single move you make) has a LOT of things considered, from the speed of projectiles flying at you, to how spells affect the enviorment are re-checked to apply their affect again, and how everyone runs around. This is perhaps one of the only turn-based RPGs I know that has a heavy emphasis on mobilty. You CANNOT, I REPEAT, CANNOT run around without a plan. You. Will. DIE. Doesn't matter if you have badass armor and defense-increasing skills on. You cannot block everything or tank everything. Even TANKS in this game have to consider mobility, and know when it's time to run and reposition themselves. The only class that can remotely do this is Bulwark, which I feel is "THE" class everyone should play first. They have a rediculous amount of defense, but it won't get you too far in the game alone. Learning the game takes time, and many deaths.\n\nOn the bright side, this complex combat is actually very satisfying once you understand how it works. There's SO MANY WAYS TO END YOUR FOES. From DEVOURING THEM to YELLING AT THEM TO DEATH. The amount of classes is purely absurd, and to this day I've STILL not tried them all. On top of that, you have Races. Humans, Elves...There's many more, and each has sub-species within it. The reason why I won't say who they are, is because it's considered spoilers. Sorry. Although, I will say there's only a few races that have classes usable only by them, you can mix and match pretty much anything. There's a lot of depth in a single class, and with so many, there's a lot to learn here. On top of that, the loot is satisfying to obtain. I've even carried some things I couldn't use because it just sounded so badass. I ain't giving my Corpsebow to a mere shopkeeper!\n\nAlso, the difficulty settings are very varied. You have two different kinds that come into play when you play the game. Difficulty, and the Style of the Difficulty.\n\n{Easy}\n\n{Normal}\n\n{Nightmare}\n\n---and so on---   Those difficulties change how hard the game is. How strong foe's talents are, the level of the zones, and so on. The higher the difficulty, the more EXP you earn. There are three difficulties locked when you start the game.\n\nAnd the Styles:\n\n{Exploration}  Infinite lives. You are beyond death! The difficulty I say you should NEVER play, it ruins the experience. But if you don't like having a bad time, I won't judge you. There are a lot of gorgeous sights to see in the game.\n\n{Adventure} You gain lives on select level-ups. Simple, not overpowered, but not the core experience.\n\n{Rougelike} "You ARE your character." You only have one life. The moment you die, your character is immediately deleted. :gameover: However! You can still find ways to revive yourself in game, such as a rare-as-it-can-get vial. THIS is the Style of difficulty I always play on. It's my preference.\n\n\n\nAppearance\nIt's visuals....are alright. It's your typical fantasy style, but it's not too distracting for me, actually. It's the enviorment I'm in, so I roll with it. It's great for what it is, there's a LOT of variety here! You'll be in space, heaven and hell, wintery landscapes, swamps, and volcanoes! Personally, I like it. But I can see how people might be "turned off" by it. Honestly, there's not a lot to say. One of the few games I say imagination works in it's favor!\n\n\n\nSoundIt serves it's duty. Spells sound like spells, fists sound like fists, steel sounds like steel. There's no glaring issue with the sound, but nor is there anything that stands out as supreme. The soundtrack? Well...The music in the game is the same, it serves what it's meant to do. I honestly have muted the music for a long time now, and have other things in the background, like the news or music. It's one of THOSE kinds of games, despite it's complexity, where you can focus on other things while playing it. It IS turn based, as well.\n\nOn that note, like how I feel with Sanctuary RPG, once I've played long enough, I'm "in tune" with the game, reading information at only a glance, making actions with speed and care. Even when I set the game down for a few weeks, I was very easilly able to get back into this state.\n\n\nStory\nThe story of Maj'Eyal is a fantasy, what would you expect? If you can suspend disbelief, you will find so much to read and learn about the word. Well written poems, stories, and last words of daring adventurers before you. There are several campaigns, but the one with the most amount of story is, well, "Tales Of Maj'Eyal". There is also the Arena and the Infinite Dungeon. Personally, the Arena isn't very fun to me, but I absolutely LOVE the Infinite Dungeon. You and the endless dungeon crawling experience that this game offers, with nothing in your way beyond blood thirsty monsters and glorious loot. It feels alive.\n\n\nConclusionAll in all, there's not too many RPGs like this. Where it manages to be...a community driven single player game. It's definately unique in that regard. With such a cheap RPG, why not buy it? Well, the initial ramp of difficulty (and throughout the game, regardless of skill) requires stategy over going wild with a sword, so this isn't the kind of game you can sit down with if you have little time. It respects your time, however, and the community is very helpful, VERY alive...The sound and appearance will not satisfy everyone, but it serves what it lives for. Things sound exactly like they would. I don't think giving it a "Score" would satisfy myself with the review, so I'll simply give the answer of "I highly reccomend this." To ALL RPG fans!\n\n\n\nMods that I use and reccomend.(gahh there is no more room on the review so here have a pastebin with the last tidbit)\n\nhttp://pastebin.com/m2genWSA","March 15","true","225.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

There's lots of classes, areas, items, and spells, and things to do.  Very little feels redundant or samey.\n\nUnlike most Roguelikes, there is a plot.\n\nAs claimed, there is indeed no need to grind.\n\nPermadeath can be turned off with no penalty.  This partially makes up for many of the bad aspects of the game.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal is a true Roguelike.  Most of its flaws are common to most members of the genre.\n\nLike most Roguelikes, there are horrendous balance problems.  You will frequently encounter creatures of widely varying levels in the same area.  Some of these enemies move so fast, and hit so hard, just seeing them on your screen almost guarantees death.  If you have permadeath on, and aren't a masochist, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nTurning permadeath off doesn't completely solve the balance problems.  It also just feels bad.  Resurrecting where you were, with full hit points and no negative statuses, with the enemies as you left them, results in you either being deathlocked or overpowered.  I would rather it have saved every 5 minutes, then load the save from 5 minutes ago when I die.  That would both feel fairer, and prevent the deathlock problem.  Being able to willingly back up further (lose more progress) would be even better insurance against being deathlocked.\n\nLike most Roguelikes, there are terrible guidance problems.  In most Roguelikes this is due to there being no guidance at all.  While Tales of Maj'Eyal has problems with insufficient guidance, it does have some guidance, due to the main quest and side quests directing you to the ‘next’ areas.  However, sometimes you encounter strange interactive widgets and need to decide what, if anything, to do with them.  There is no guidance here, and if you do the wrong thing the results are often lethal.  Tales of Maj'Eyal has somewhat unique problems with malicious guidance.  The main and side quests will frequently send you to places without any hint that you better purchase some items or allocate points in some abilities to counteract the next boss' game-breaking abilities, or simply lead you to locations full of enemies far beyond your level.  If you're going to play this, save yourself some frustration and just look everything that should have been in the game up on a wiki.\n\nYou will occasionally encounter wandering friendly characters.  They always need to be safely escorted out of the area.  There should be more variety in what they want from you.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nA few people are complaining about the graphics.  Traditionally Roguelikes didn't have graphics (or sound).  Everything was represented with text characters and you had to learn to read the screen (e.g. @ is the player character).  You could usually select a location on the screen for a more detailed explanation.  While many of us enjoyed using our imagination, it did prevent Roguelikes from being popular with the masses.  The few that have graphics now often adopted them due to running out of ASCII characters to represent things with, before Unicode support was widespread and good monospaced Unicode fonts were available.  So it's a matter of perspective whether Tales of Maj'Eyal has good or bad graphics.","November 22, 2015","true","29.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Through your many deaths, however (and there will be many) - you will learn how to survive to the deeper reaches of the game.\n\nGreat unique classes too.  Many of which are unlike any I have seen in any other game.  If u just enjoy speccing out characters in rpg's and mmo's then this game will scratch that itch too.  Though many of the classes need to be unlocked through achieving things in game in order to play them.\n\nThe game has a free version too, so you can try before you buy.  Buying makes you like a 'donator' and you get extra features like a class and a game-mode that free players can't get.  But you can play for free and still unlock the majority of things.\n\nI'm buying even though I already have the game and have been playing it for years, just because Darkgod and contributors have put so much good work into the game that if anyone deserves some of my game $, they do.  So if you're not sure about the game, give the free version a try, then come back and buy it if ya like it.\n\nIf you're not a patient person, or don't like difficult games, or you need your rpg's to be 3d or real time, then ya might wanna pass.

The base version of this game is free and may help you to determine wether or not this game is for you.\n\nMy first experiences with this game were kinda "meh" not because the game is bad but just because i felt like it was hard to get into (that might be a personal thing tho). I made a big mistake by shoving it to the side for a while thinking this game wasnt for me. In a phase of boredom i picked this game up again and used my time to get into it and hell - I'm fascinated. i litteraly can't stop playing - this game has so much depth and so much to give for such a little price it's just wow.\n\nDarkgod is the prime example for a good game developer - give it for free and let the people choose wether or not to pay for it. I feel bad now for picking this gem up when it was on sale and i only payed about 70c so i donated another 5 Euro for now just because the game is so great (i'll probably donate even more just because i won't stop playing this game aslong as things are beeing developed for it)\n\n\nEnough for the story telling now lets get to the raw information:\n\n\nPro's:\n\nGreat story: you got ALOT of texts to read for background information about races , the past events , demons , long lost civilizations etc etc etc. if you realy want to you can get ALOT of information.\n\nGameplay: AMAZING - the game has so much depth telling you all about it would fill about 100's of sites so just go find out yourself you realy won't be disappointed. trust me on this.\nRoguelike typical RNG\ntons and tons and tons of randomly generated equipment aswell as our all beloved legendary equipment which stays the same.\nBrilliant skills and spells which would also be too much to talk about in detail right here.\n\nGraphics: Lovely oldschoolish graphics (i know it's not for everyone but for me personaly it's great.)\n\nActive developer: Darkgod is always working on this game , hell he even shows up online regulary and starts random events for everyone thats playing in that moment ( this can be Zones , small buffs , useless but funny buffs or even other things which i'm not gonna mention.\n\nOnline community ingame: Okay now this one is great and probably my most favorite function in this game - even tho this is a singleplayer game it has an online function which is basicaly just a chat where you can link items , talk to people , see what other people do (deaths,archievements etc). This is especialy helpfull when starting out because the community is great and always helpfull (hey Xlambda , minmay etc :D). When you're more experienced it's still helpfull for lets say Item comparsion or just simple chatting while playing along.\n\n\nCons: A little hard to get into but as i said above that might just be me personally and yet it's not that hard just takes a little bit of time and dedication.\n\nThats about it.\n\n\nI give this game a 10/10 on my personal scale - im TOTALY in love with it and 'am planing to play it for a LONG time.\n\n\nDarkgod you're my hero.","November 28, 2015","true","171.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

It gets rid of some of the unnessesary junk like hunger and identifying items, but sacrifices none of the gameplay depth. It focuses on hardcore dungeon crawling action mixed with questing. Most of the classes are initially locked, and while I thought this sucked at first, looking back on things, it actually got me to try out classes I would have never tried otherwise. As it turns out, I actually liked those classes and had a fun time playing them. All the classes play entirely different from each other and have a wide variety of different skills to choose from. There are also many races to choose from, each with their own bonuses and unique skill tree. Thanks to the numerous skill and race choices, playthroughs of the same class can play quite differently.  The game is incredibly fleshed out in these respects, keeping each play fairly fresh.","January 21, 2014","true","126.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This puke was so mighty that it not only healed him and removed status effects, but also damaged opponenets and cleansed their buffs, all in a large radius around my knight. Combined with my power to project a path of sunshine that took no time to traverse, I'd skate into a room full of baddies, glowing all holy light, spew vomit, and then finish everything off with a direct invocation of the sun that's more like a quasar igniting at the edge of a blackhole.\n\nDid I mention that my random lamp item that made me undead was called 'Taintblight'?\n\nThis collision of three entirely different abilities and a crazy and evocative random name generator is only one example of dozens such synergies and strange stories that I have experienced in playing Tales of Maj'Eyal.\n\nOf course much of that imagery came from my own willingness to fill in the blanks because Tales of Maj'Eyal is a roguelike run by one guy (as far as I can tell), who has packed in a tremendous amount of lore, options and imagination. The graphics are like sprites from a nineties turned-based game that would run on a 486. The sounds aren't really any better. The muscial score is acceptable, but since the whole affair runs at my leisure, I listen to absolutely anything else while playing.\n\nBut the value in this game isn't in its looks, but in all the options, variations and odd enemies it offers.\n\nWhile the game can be played like a true roguelike (one life and you're done), there are several difficulty and re-spawn options that help make the game more accessible to players looking for different challenge (and frustration) levels. There are also several unlockable races and classes whose progress is tracked across multiple playthroughs. By opening up more options, the game stays fresh the longer you play.\n\nOf course, having so many class and race combinations leads to wild imbalances in capability. Some combinations simply become mathematically better, overall. However, the game throws so many different kinds of enemies and effects that attack, weaken and kill your character in so many ways that almost any character will expose an Achilles Heel at some point in a playthrough.\n\nThe game has incredible difficulty spikes, so playing true roguelike is recommened only for those with tremendous intestinal fortitude. I recall losing a rogue-like character 20 hours into the game due to missing a debuff icon that I didn't recognize, laid on me by an unusual random boss that was blocked by one of the over-sized two-block larger enemies. Of course, since it's turn based I could have taken a beat and re-examined the fifteen different effects, good and bad, that were on my character at that moment, so the mistake is ultimately mine.\n\nThat said, I didn't play again for a few days.\n\nThis does bring up a complaint about the game's lack of documentation. There are a ton of systems packed in, entire mechanics that might only be encountered on playing a particular character class. These often behave differently from every other resource in the game. Am I expending this resource straight away or do I have to build it up? Does this resource have a conflict or synergy with my armor choices or my other talents?\n\nAll these esoteric, imaginative and rule breaking powers interact in ways that aren't always clear. After logging over a thousand hours in this game, over three years, I still don't know what a few of the stats mean.\n\nWhile most of the dungeons are procedurally generated, some smaller zones are always the same and the overland map only varies based off a handful of bonus zones that require prerequisites to appear. This sameness of the larger world and the horrifically imbalanced and hazardous random patrols make travel between dungeons tedious. But this is a relatively small criticism since the overland travel isn't a large portion of gameplay.\n\nIf roguelikes are your bag, this one offers both a sense of progression from overall play by doling out new classes and races with unlocks, as well as a wide variety of enemies and all sorts of crazy loot. The difficulty spikes can be tremendous, so that the higher difficulties really demand use of the game's clairvoyance and/or movement powers to survive. This game seeded and fostered my imagination and provided all sorts of unusual combinations of gear, talents and events to keep my thoroughly entertained. Though I don't tend to play for long stretches any more (except with new DLC), I keep coming back for twenty or thirty minutes of play on whatever experiment of race and class that appeals to me at the time.\n\nI can't think of any other game (except an MMO), that has had me coming back again and again for more than a couple months, let alone three years.","March 4","true","372.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","6","7","4","0"

Game Mechanics are plentiful but they are spelled out and not hidden from the player. User Interface for the most part is easy to get into and use.\n\nThere are a couple of hurdles one will need to commit to however in order to play this game - like any Roguelike there is the overall Game Depth and Learning Curve and Tales of Maj'Eyal is no different. Character skills sort of level up similar to what you might find in an MMORPG or Diablo-like, but skills themsleves are also much like their counterparts not descriptive enough to tell you what they do and you'll have to test them out or read up on them.\n\nFor people coming from other Roguelikes, you may be thrown off by the sheer Tactical Nature of combat, Additionally it is worth noting that the game is meant to be played in Adventurer Mode - IE, Multiple Lives, not One. Lastly, the game is long - very long. A full run from start to actual finish is probably going to be longer then most other Roguelikes bar a few.\n\nAll in all though, this is a very enjoyable game. Once you get past the couple tidbits that might hold you back or throw you off you'll likely have lots of fun playing with multiple races and classes in separate but distinct ways.","January 29, 2014","true","380.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At this point I can say it is more than good.  This roguelike is pretty brilliant if you ask me.  And I think it's developed by just one dude.  That's the impression I've been given.\n\nTurn-based combat, a large amount of enemy variety, some randomly generated elements, and strong character building makes for a good amount of fun and diversity in every playthrough.  There are many races and classes for you to choose from too, all with their own unique qualities in the form of different stats and skills.

In short, if you judge it purely as a roguelike, I don't thing it don't hold up too well. Part of the reason I may think that may be my preference for NetHack influenced roguelikes, and my lack of familiarity or appreciation for Angband influenced or Ancient Domains of Mystery influenced rogelikes, but I am not sure how much Tales of Maj'Eyal's design is based on those games.\n\nOn the other hand, judged as a RPG Tales of Maj'Eyal does a lot of things right. It has a rather interesting tactical battle system, lots of different character creation options, many ways to tweak and customize your skills, any many items to find that offer a lot of tactical death. It's story, while perhaps presented in a way that relies too much on finding and reading lore text, is at least interesting and presents a few dark twists on the standard high fantasy setting.\n\nNo mater how you judge it, the interface is great, mostly easy to use but able to do a lot, the battles are fast-pasted and fun, and it can be very addicting. The graphics are simple but more then functional enough for what they are, and there are enough interesting special effects and visual flare to make up for the more static sprites. The music is generic but memorable and sometimes can actually be pretty fantastic, even if it is more or less all part of free game music packs.\n\nI think that is all that really needs o be said, but here is some more detail about how I think about it as a roguelike:\n\nThe big problem with Tales of Maj'Eyal's design as a roguelike is simply that the game is too long, story heavy, and not random enough. There is variation in the loot you get and the monsters you face, but the over all world is basically set. Same world map, same town, same quests. The layout of a lot of the random zones are different but the basic themes of the zones are set, and each zone has a set rank for items, a set number of floors, a set list of enemies and possible bosses. Due to how the game is balanced and how enemies never respawn except in a few cases, it's basically required to repeat every zone and sidequest each run or you end up drastically underleveled very quickly, and due to each zone having fixed level requirements you can't even vary the order that much.\n\nAlthough you actually have multiple lives before dieing in the default mode, permadeath still is a problem and when it happens you have to start over from he start and go through the same old stuff you already saw again. There is a mode where you can simply have infinite lives, but I kind of wish there was some kind of middle ground, perhaps a way to start over with a new character but with a number of story events that carry over and alter the world. There is a unlock system that adds new races, classes, skill trees, and other things, and that helps, but it still only adds so much and may of the unlocks are obscure or tedious.\n\nI also have a problem with a lot of the streamlining or elimination of a lot of roguelike staples potions and scrolls are gone, and instead characters can equip a number of infusions or runes that can be used over and over again but have a cooldown timer between uses (actually every skill and magic spell in Tales of Maj'Eyal uses cooldown timers, I am not really a fan of them but it works). Wands and other tools work in a similar way as well. This eliminates stockpiling of consumable items, but also eleminates the sort of careful rationing of your resources you need to worry about in other roguelikes.\n\nIt's only logical because of this that the whole item identification game is gone and no items have overall negative effects, eliminating the kind of risk vs reward of using items in a panic. Many people may not like needing to worry about identifying stuff but the feature exists in roguelikes for a reason, the same reason randomized levels exist, to make sure you can't just win with rote memorization, and so every action you take has to be done very carefuly. Roguelikes since the original Rogue have always been about exploration and experimentation and the whole idea with unknown items was a big factor in that.\n\nBut again, despite all of these things I don't like about it as a roguelike, I still think it's a really good RPG. Maybe there isn't really that much of a difference, most roguelikes are basically RPGs after all, I just thought I would share my feelings on the subject.","February 13, 2015","true","47.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Game Mechanics are plentiful but they are spelled out and not hidden from the player. User Interface for the most part is easy to get into and use.\n\nThere are a couple of hurdles one will need to commit to however in order to play this game - like any Roguelike there is the overall Game Depth and Learning Curve and Tales of Maj'Eyal is no different. Character skills sort of level up similar to what you might find in an MMORPG or Diablo-like, but skills themsleves are also much like their counterparts not descriptive enough to tell you what they do and you'll have to test them out or read up on them.\n\nFor people coming from other Roguelikes, you may be thrown off by the sheer Tactical Nature of combat, Additionally it is worth noting that the game is meant to be played in Adventurer Mode - IE, Multiple Lives, not One. Lastly, the game is long - very long. A full run from start to actual finish is probably going to be longer then most other Roguelikes bar a few.\n\nAll in all though, this is a very enjoyable game. Once you get past the couple tidbits that might hold you back or throw you off you'll likely have lots of fun playing with multiple races and classes in separate but distinct ways.","January 29, 2014","true","380.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game and genre isn't for everybody and you know it.  Personally, I was just looking for a low graphics game to have for play on my laptop... only to find myself putting in tens of hours on my desktop as well.\n\nMy first roguelike was Dungeons of Dredmor, which was fun, but in terms of gameplay options and experimentation, it just wasn't enough.  This game is more than enough.  There are 26 classes in this game, most of which have unique playstyles and minimal overlap.  Between those, there are many ways to build most of them with endless opportunities to experiment and die horribly in different ways.  The UI is confusing at first, but very functional once you get the hang of it.  There is a significant mod community for those who are into that.\n\nThe game comes with most of the classes and some races unlocked.  This is somewhat controversial but for me was highly beneficial for my enjoyment of the game.  Making the classes unlockable makes the game much less overwhelming to pick up and provides a significant sense of progression even when your character fails to win the game.  Once those classes are unlocked, higher difficulty options and mods continue to extend the game's life.\n\nHealing potions and most consumables are replaced by cooldown-based "Inscriptions" and "Runes," which is perfect because it removes any sort of "saving for a rainy day" hesitation players tend to have in combat.\n\nThere are a couple of issues with this game.  Some rigs may encounter excessive memory leaks with the default graphics settings.  Graphics and sound are expected to be minimal but there are a few obnoxious sound effects and themes in the game and some volume imbalance.  As commonly seen in these games, early level progression with many classes at higher difficulties is extremely frustrating.  But these issues are minor.

If you want an idea of what makes it different;\n\nNo identification. All items are identified immediately upon picking them up. This wasn't the case in earlier versions of the game, but the large and increasing number of fixed artifacts and no need for identification scrolls made it somewhat pointless.\n\nPotions and scrolls are replaced by infusions and runes, which give on-demand abilities that consume no permanent resources -with a limited number of slots for these abilities. Regeneration infusions are the primary method of healing, replacing healing potions, and runes of teleportation replace scrolls of teleportation as an escape from trouble. Nothing is lost in their use, but they have cooldowns.\n\nA system for "extra lives". Before you crucify the game, extra lives is either a startup option akin to lowering the difficulty("roguelike" mode for one life, "Adventure" for three, "Exploration" for unlimited) or through very rare artifacts or abilities in-game. Also, it doesn't save you if you decided to hug an Elven Corruptor and he blows you up the first turn you revive.\n\nDisable-heavy combat. Simply, being resilient to damage through armor or magical resistance is not as important as being difficult to disable. Stuns and confusion are the leading killers, not high burst damage. This makes it very easy to get chain-disabled and killed if you haven't prepared properly with high saving throws or effect clears(certain runes and infusions will remove a detrimental effect from you on use).\n\nAll of these things combined could make it seem like a somewhat casual roguelike, but in practice it isn't really any easier than similar contemporary roguelikes. The only element that is truly missing is resource management. You still must assess risks, prepare for and pick your battles carefully, and adapt to what the RNG has provided you. The cooldowns-based combat and lack of resource management should be considered an interesting spin, not an intentional dumbing down.","June 19, 2014","true","36.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","1"

A nearly full version of the game is freely available from the game developer's site at te4.org. If you enjoy the game (which I'm sure that you will), then you can buy it to unlock the last few features. If it isn't your cup of tea (you monster), then you are none the poorer.\n\nI'll go ahead and write my pointless review, though. I have nothing better to do with my life.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal (TOME) is a quirky, old roguelike that has seen a few iterations. Once “Tales of Middle Earth” it has morphed, refined, and evolved over the years stripping out the Tolkien story elements and replacing them with quasi-World of Warcraft story elements. It's still changing and improving, new patches are always under development.\n\nI am ambivalent about the story. I like that there are no REAL bad guys, nor faultless heroes, everyone is just looking out for themselves and their own. Even the demons have legitimate gripes and may in fact be right. On the other hand it's all rather shallow, and borrows a little too heavily from WoW. Elves toy with magic out of their league, blow up planet and shattering continents, some elves turn into naga, a group of humans are trapped on another continent hounded by orcs, where have I heard this before? Player motivation is limited to “Maybe there is treasure there?” and “I heard a rumor about this place, maybe there I can murder something?”\n\nHonestly though, who plays a roguelike for the story? Gameplay is where TOME shines and why it is probably my favorite game right now. TOME is a self-declared “tactical roguelike”. You'll need to carefully manage cooldowns and move around the battlefield to survive. Some of the bosses can really tax your ability to juggle offensive and defensive spells.\n\nThere are many classes to try, no two of whom play the same. Some classes are great at jumping on opponents and soaking damage, others can dance around the battlefield dodging arrows and picking enemies off one at a time. Even the mages have a great variety, from the long range nuking elemental Archmage to the short range heal-and-shield celestial Anorithil.\n\nThis game also sports a massive amount of mods and player content. People have created new classes, races with unique starting areas, and additional quests. Check out the steam workshop but also the developer's site, as some people only post their mods there.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the game is a little too random. There are too many stats and most of them are worthless to any given character. Multiple times I've gotten to mid-game without finding any useful gear, either from drops or shops. Rares, opponents with player abilities, and random bosses can be obscenely powerful, some can't even be killed and you have to run away from them.\n\nAs for the DLC they are both great additions and should be purchased. One warning, the new classes added to the game can make certain rares really tough if you don't know how to handle them. The Embers of Rage campaign is a sequel to the base game and might spoil some of the story for you. I recommend buying the base game first and purchasing the DLC once you have beaten the game at least once.","May 26","true","855.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

One is a gladiator arena campaign and if you beat it with a character that character will be the last boss for the next character! very cool.\n\nAnother thing I find sets TOME apart from other roguelikes is the selectable difficulties, they not only have easy,normal, hard type selections but also there is exploration,adventure,roguelike choices where roguelike gives your character only 1 life (unless you can find magical items that add to it)  to live through the quest, Adventure gives you a 'free' life after certain level milestones, so when you die with an extra life you get to choose if you want to respawn where you died or outside the area.

Strikes a perfect balance between usability/user friendliness with depth and complexity. I'll review this game by highlighting what I think sets it apart from other games in the genre.\n\nNo consumable items - TOME doesn't have potions, scrolls, or wands. You choose a limited number of abilities that give you the function that consumables play in other games - quick heal, regen, teleport, blink, fireball, etc. This eliminates the issues lots of people have with hoarding consumables, not knowing when to use them, the pain of having them destroyed, etc. Picking and choosing the right abilities adds a layer of depth that doesn't exist in other roguelikes.\n\nFast - this game plays lightning fast and is very streamlined, thanks to the lack of consumables. Of course, it's turn based, so it's only as fast as you want...but I tend to play pretty fast, and lots of roguelikes feel sluggish in comparison.\n\nBroad - Lots of classes, from your standard mage and warrior to the cool weird things like Chronomancers and Wyrmics (dragon-fighters).\n\nDeep - The different classes feel distinct. In addition to the obvious (different skills and equipment), different types of classes have different types of resources (mana/stamina/equilibrium/hate/probably some other ones) that work in different ways.\n\nCombat Is Fun  - This is the only roguelike I've played where melee combat is actually fun. You get lots of buttons to push that do different things. In most roguelikes, the coolest thing about your melee character is the equipment you find. In TOME, you can actually do cool ♥♥♥♥ - charge, shout, whirlwinds, cleaves, etc.\n\nSimple - This doesn't mean easy and it doesn't mean shallow - it just means simple. Clean, streamlined design. The action bar is great - every option your character has is on it, so you always know what you can and can't do. No navigating labyrinthine menus, no checking your inventory after you died and remembering you could have used your blink, etc.\n\nOverworld - Like ADOM and not like Crawl, TOME features a static overworld that's always the same and features the same dungeons/locations, which are themselves randomized. This isn't necessarily better or worse, just putting it out there.\n\nThis game is an absolute blast. If you liked Dungeons of Dreadmor, you owe it to yourself to take a step up to a more serious and more interesting game. :)","March 8, 2014","true","99.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I have put more time into this game that I would have ever expected. I actually heard about this game a while ago when it was based in Middle Earth but I never gave it a chance. I missed out. I finally decided to try the free version and I loved it and figured I'd buy it on steam.\n\nFor starters, this game is HARD. If you have never played a roguelike before this is at least more inviting with decent graphics, but it packs all of the challenge. In a roguelike, if you die you stay dead. However, there is a more forgiving adventure mode, and even an unlimited lives exploration mode. In my opinion, exploration mode should be ignored. You need to learn to value your character and every move it makes, and being able to die over and over spoils that.\n\nThe main campaign is long and hard. It has a level cap of 50 which will just barely be reached by some races, and not hit by others due to experience penalties. Don't worry though, those races bring great bonuses along with the penalties. You can be a Yeek, a little while furry creature, and summon other yeeks or move faster than one turn allows. You can be a more traditional elf, summoning trees to your aid, or a dwarf that gains bonuses from hoarding his cash.\n\nHow hard is the campaign? You might die on your first map. You might die to your first enemy, if you're unlucky or unskilled. However, you will get better. Of the starting classes, the berserker has the ability to fight all the way to the end and survive, while learning the ins and outs of the game. The alchemist is much more fragile, but can summon a golem to aid him; it's nice to have a friend along for the tough journey. New classes, races and categories are unlocked by accomplishing various goals, from killing a certain boss to dealing one million fire damage.\n\nThere are abundant side quests, and they offer much needed bonus experience and items. The game has a randomized loot system and powerful uniques, like many modern RPGs. The skill system is deep and rewarding. You will think hard about how to distribute each precious point, and when you die you will look back at where you went wrong and how you can correct it for the next run.\n\nMy first character was a Higher (noble/special human) alchemist, and I died on the second zone that I entered. The enemies were higher level than I was, and it was just the wrong place to be in. Second I tried a Cornac (common human) berserker, and died in the game's final battle. That was a painful loss, but I went back to the drawing board and came in with a Wyrmic; a dragon-based character with the power of nature on his side. This time I made it, and managed to unlock almost everything along the way as well (except for the aforementioned one million fire damage, which took me a lot longer).\n\nThe game is offered for free, with the paid version offering very little additional content. However, I have to strongly recommend purchasing the game here on steam. This game deserves recognition, it's a really great and lovingly crafted roguelike/rpg. The more purchases it gets, the more it will gain prominence and the more work will be done on it. According to his website, the developer has many more campaigns in the works, including one that lets us play from the side of the villainous (or downtrodden and misunderstood?) orcs. I'm looking forward to more and this game has rightfully earned a spot on my favorites list.","December 31, 2013","true","170.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story has since been moved to a new campaign world. Also the classic scroll/potion-mechanic was traded in for a different system of cooldown abilities. Combat was overhauled for a faster streamlined experience -no farming, mobs don't respawn. Good for beginners although hardcore roguelike-veterans might miss typical roguelike chaos. Unlike other roguelikes the number of realistic interactions is low so you will not dip a rod in a potion or throw a ring in a sink here. No need to memorize 10000 key binds. Everything is already identified. The focus clearly lies on fighting monsters and straight action. Complexity is achieved by balancing your equipment, stats, and abilities + tactical fighting + knowing when to fight or run.\n\nSome features:\nThe game is as deadly as most roguelikes however permadeath can be switched off, too. Many advanced races and classes can be unlocked by actions in the game so there is always a reason to start the game anew and try a different combination. There is a built-in chat/news flash so you can read if another player gets wasted, hehe. High-Scores, Mods. Procedurally generated dungeons, static over-world with some dungeons/events randomly placed.\n\nSo:\nI can recommend the game for most roguelike RPG fans - you can still download the full game for free and play it, then decide to donate or buy on steam if you liked it so you can't lose really.","December 13, 2013","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BearKenster/recommended/259680/","BearKenster","An Actual Bear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BearKenster/","265 products in account","I believe this game to be a true, natural evolution of the roguelike genre. It has all the fun and challenge of a classic roguelike but updated with modern conveniences. Not to mention this game is just sopping wet with lore that, if you actually take the time to read through, is pretty damn interesting. In short, it's been an amazing experience so far. If you're a fan of the classics like ADOM then I couldn't recommend this enough.\n\nOne of the things I absolutely adore about this game is all the unlockables. In a genre in which you can die fairly quickly or lose hours of progress over one stupid mistake, you need good amounts of replay value to keep you rolling characters. This game does that pretty well with tons of unlockables. You not only have races, classes and talent trees to unlock, but also prodigy unlocks that'll give every character you roll items like the transmogrification box which automatically picks up junk items and turns them into gold.\n\nThere's a fairly good variety of dungeons in this game. Not only in style and layout but in the ways you can go about progressing in them. I found myself in a cave with no hallways filled with passive worms that chewed up sections of the wall. In order to go to the next room you needed to follow one of these worms and if you stuck around in one of its tunnels for too long it could collapse on you. Made for a really intense boss fight at the end. Not to mention each dungeon is filled to burst with it's own lore which is definitely a plus. A lot of them have little challenges too in the form of rooms behind stuck doors. If you choose to open these doors you're usually faced with tough monsters and traps, but also some pretty fancy loot. It's completely optional so if you're struggling to get through a dungeon then it's just not worth it.\n\nIn the time I've been playing I haven't been able to find a whole lotta quests. It seems like half the people you talk to early-game are all looking for potion ingredients but the rest were actually pretty interesting. I found a secret door in the overworld that took me to a rogue's den where they captured a merchant. You have the choice of joining the rogues or freeing the merchant which unlocks a rare items shop in one of the towns. Later-game quests get more interesting as well.\n\nTeaching someone how to play your game is very important. It's something I think about every time I play a game and it can ultimately ruin a player's experience early on if they have no idea what they're doing. Now this is especially difficult with games like this that are filled with content and complexity. The solution? Unlockables. This game gives you the basics of each different type of class to start off with. This keeps the player from being overwhelmed with options at the beginning or the advanced know-how to play the more strategic classes. It also gives the player a goal early on to keep them playing. I had no trouble at all learning how to play this game. If you're new to roguelikes then I don't think you'd have troubles either.\n\nI think my only real gripe with this game is the random escort missions you get on some dungeon floors. They're great in that if you do manage to escort them to their portal, you get a pretty decent reward. However, their ai is absolutely ridiculous. They tend to blindly trudge slowly towards their portal and tend to get themselves trapped between monsters or just refuse to run away from some of them which is double bad if you're a ranged class. There's a mod in the workshop that helps with this problem but the problem's still kinda there, you're just able to make them wait in one spot for x amount of turns.\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic. The amount of content you get in this game is astounding, too. Even it's DLC is soaked in content. Not to mention the price is pretty damn reasonable. If you're into roguelikes then there's no reason not to pick this up. If you're trying to get into roguelikes but are left feeling empty playing roguelike-likes or games that claim to have "roguelike elements" expecting to get that same rush playing NetHack then you owe it to yourself to play this game. You can tell the developer put a lot of love into it and they deserve every cent they get.","June 17, 2015","true","32.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics are not a selling point in this title, but the gameplay should be. With tons of unlocks, lots of ways to stat and build characters, castes and quests to choose that will vary gameplay widely, and a big variety of enemies, if you've never gotten into a RL before but would like to try, get this.\n\nIf you're like me and more experienced in the genre, I still recommend it as this does some interesting things with the forumula--the capacity for kind of rogue-like not-quite-permadeath; the ability to (for example) forswear all arcane magic in exchange for joining a new faction of the game and learning magic-disrupting powers; the fact that one school of magic is powered mostly by paradox (and you can meet and kill yourself! ?.?) means that this is much more in-depth a game than the RLs of the 90s. Sure, you can pick this up free on the developer's website, but you should pay for it (here or there) just to support the effort.\n\n8.5 out of 10--which back in the old days on PC Gamer, meant that this is a classic well worth your time. :)","January 18, 2014","true","17.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game were my first try, and today is a game i often play when i'm bored.\n\nPretty simple at the beginning, you choose a class, a race, a name and a gender, then the gamemod (you'll unlock them as you play) and the difficulty/lifes for your character, with complete freedom to choose between some easy and relaxing way to start understanding how the game works, or to begin with an insane journey with only one life that you'll probably lose very soon.\nAs i mentioned, you can unlock other gamemods while you play and complete certain tasks, and same thing is for other classes and races to have further plays with, trying out new playstyles and techniques.\n\nIt can be an unfair experience most of the times, even when playing with a standard difficulty and with a set amount of lives, so don't try to get too upset when losing your character from a single killing blow by a "something"-caster (if not "anything"-caster), or for losing a fight with strange unique monsters that have for some reason your same skills/spells, or by overpowered monsters that have 40 more levels than you, that appeared when moved a little harmless rock.\n\nIt's surely an experience that should be tried by those who even thinks to dislike this genre of games, because this is a new perspective that should be taken into account if you didn't liked a previous one of the same subject; this doesn't mean that this game will be valued the same way by everyone who tries it, since it still is (and always be) one of the most difficult games, where to succeed one of the best way is not to win it, but to lose trying to do it.","April 13, 2015","true","164.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And yet it's a great introduction to the roguelike genre, because there are options to play it with a number of lives, or even unlimited ones, to get the hang of the game! Not EVERYTHING is randomized (there are fixed artifacts, fixed locations, etc but it still feels like a roguelike). Also, it contains intuitive UI and gameplay. For example, there are practically no consumables like potions and scrolls - not in the sense we're accostumed to. Instead, your powers (and some items) have cooldowns along with, naturally, some resource management (stamina, mana, psi, etc.). Cast X spell/move? Wait Z turns to use it again. Or, maybe, use some talent that can reset some cooldowns ;-). That cooldown system is really intuitive and just one of the many reasons I'm in love with ToME.\n\nNow let's talk about the world. I'm not an old ToME follower but unless I'm mistaken, it used to be set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth, until it was changed to a more original lore. And it's a great lore: the continent of Eyal was, some time ago, devastated by catatrophic used of magic (i.e the Spellblaze), there are still mage hunters (Zigur), there are political issues (Halflings are militaristic and even used to slave Yeeks); heck, even the demons have a touching and fantastic backstory! So, in terms of lore, the game has good stuff to offer. Some of the actual places are very creative, too: tunnels of sand that can collapse and swallow the uncautious adventurer, underwater ruins, necromancer dens, forests, deserts, and so on...\n\nIn terms of races/classes, there are 11 races and 26 classes, allowing for tons of builds. There are your classic warriors (Bulwark, Berserker), mages (Archmage, Necromancer) and even exotic classes that can manipulate things like their foes' dreams (Solipsist), draconic powers (Wyrmic) and even time itself (Temporal Warden, Paradox Mage)! Most of the races and classes are unlocked as you progress in the game and do certain tasks, which aren't too hard, honestly. But if you're impatient, then you can look for an addon (mod) that unlocks everything right out of the bat. ;-)\n\nAnyway, it's getting too long. I typed all of that to convice you to PLAY THE GAME. Seriously, play it. It's great, no matter if you're a roguelike veteran or new to the genre (like me, actually)!","June 6, 2015","true","154.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

A quick google search later, you may have found yourself unsure. A game typically based on high fantasy narrative, I like, procedural generation, I like, turn-based gameplay, I love, permanent death, I.. Wait WHAT? That sounds frusterating and like it could get very tedious.\n\nWell, I said to myself, I might as well give it a go, my first rogue-like for only a few dollars. I started off as a Human subrace known as the Cornac Humans, I chose to play as one of the tanky classes known as the Bulwark. I began in a forest surrounded by trolls and foxes, cornered right from the start. Fortunately I ended up allocating my beginning stat points towards being extra defensive. I shield bashed and sliced my way through the trolls and wildlife, and it felt good. It wasn't extremely demanding of you, you don't need to have a mouse to do well. Very comfortable battles, and so many interesting abilities, on a wide veriety of class and race combos.\n\nThe graphics are old school but they stole my heart. This game has a lot of old school elements, but the genius creativity of the developers just blew my mind. The sheer amount of effects and abilities in the game are incredible, things like poison and teleportation are nothing in comparison to some of the crazy cool abilities these developers cooked up. In my opinion the amazing ability of these developers in not just in the cool ideas they come up with, but the absolutely brilliant way they implement them. Piling your enemies on your shield and swinging them away, warping to the other side of solid objects, slowing the speed of incoming projectiles,  vaulting over adjecent characters, its all done so well.\n\nThe game can seem a little tedious only if you are always rushing. You tend to run into creatures you maybe should have waited for. Sometimes you dont activate your defense spells for the midge swarm until you realize its high level and your almost dead. Sometimes you don't expect things to go a the way they do and there is no going back to an older save. When you die too many times and lose your character, you have the choice to begin again. Now you can do a little better than before, stat your character better. I find it very fun in ToME, there are so many classes and so many ways to play with them.\n\nIf you hve any doubts about ToME, it should only be because your unsure how 7 dollars could really buy such an awesome game.

Classes have skills like in WoW but with more skills and more customization akin to an ARPG. Things that could be tedious are streamlined not to be, for example loot you don't want is automatically disenchanted for gold at end of level. The campaign to actually win is long, but not too long. You can play with only 1 life or with a few lives and unlock a few more the further you get, which is great because even a very experienced player will likely die a few times on nightmare difficulty and above. The classes are completely unique and have a lot going on with them. If you enjoy min/maxing a brand new class with a bunch of abilities, you can do that for hundreds of hours since there are so many classes. This game has a tendency to make time pass by faster than expected like in Civilization games.\n\nOnly negative I have with it is that the early game on the highest difficulties is too unforgiving.\n\nAlso my initial impression of the game wasn't great, it took me about an hour to start to realize how good it was.","June 11, 2015","true","138.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlike traditional roguelike different classes play COMPLETELY different and indroduce new and interesting mechanics (like the manipulation of time for example). Almost every style of play is to be found here; from being a nasty necromancer and summoning skeletons and bone giants to slaughter your enemies to the time manipulating bow - dual weapon hybrid to the anti-magic "slime mage" that posisons his enemies, summons slimes to control the battlefield and uses PSIBLADES (F***ING PSIONIC LASERSWORDS).\nIn addition to the HUGE amount of classes, the classes themselves are extremly complex by having many different skill-trees to develop and unlock. While some people might see this as a negative I feel like this adds a lot of complexity of depth to the game and makes you able to play classes in completely different ways.\n\nTL;DR: DO YOU LIKE DEEP RPGs?

If you are down here reading reviews, it's because you're not 100% sure about getting the game, and figured it would help to see what other people think about it. Let me help you out, friend: Buy this game.\n\nI had my doubts too, at first. It's hard to tell what the game is like from the trailer, and the graphics ain't Skyrim. It's ok. Just buy the game, and you will be happier then you were in that soon forgotten time where you didn't have the game.\n\nYou want reasons? Ok, I have plenty of those. First off, this is one of the greatest Rouge style RPGs you will ever play. Easy to jump into, but will take many hours till you even begin to figure it all out enough to survive to level 20+. Multiple races and classes, and each class feels different, with multiple ways to develop. No potions to hoard, and death is always around the corner. Hotbar of actions like an MMO, including activated item abilities. Great sense of humor, and frequently updated. All done by one programmer, DarkGod, who randomly pops into the game to turn you into a rabbit. In this game you can eat the heart of a Sandworm, read monster poetry, and get killed by your future self.\n\nRouge mode is true Rouge, one death is all you get. Adventure mode gives you a few lives, and more as you level. The 3rd mode lets you keep coming back, but you don't want that mode. That mode is for squares. Try adventure mode, and try not to die before you make it to the Master.\n\nSeriously, this game is incredible. It is digital crack, and should be sold with a warning label. It's the top down rougelike MMOishRPG you didn't know you were missing. Great replayability, great depth, great community. Check out the forum for help on builds, or figuring out what all the stats/elements/statuses do. The Dev has been known to implement ideas right from the forums into the game. And if you are reading this during the big Steam Summer Sale, this game is selling for under $4. Did I mention that Z is the shortcut for auto-explore? Yep, it will even explore the board for you. ToME is one of those games that you will bond with random strangers over. It's a "Oh crap, is it 4am already?" game. It's a game you need in your library. Do it.

It's from the less wackyrandom branch of roguelikes so there's less stuff you have to learn by dying constantly and not so many unfair instadeaths. This can be a good thing if you don't like RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, but if you enjoy Nethack-type randomness more you might find this game a bit boring.\n\nThe best part of the game is the character development. There's tons of classes and races and while you start with the more usual ones like warriors and rogues, through game events you will unlock dozens more ranging from time-travellers to plague cultists with quite unique gameplay mechanics. There are tons of optional skill trees to unlock through quests so your characters will become quite varied.\n\nMinus points for the completely bland levels, monsters and itemization. There's an ADOM-type overworld map which ensures that not every area is a traditional dungeon, but the levels themselves are just plain boring with no interesting features. Then again the game does have a great auto-explore function so at least you don't have to slog through the dull mazes manually, this is a really good addition, you can fast-forward to the next encounter. Item-wise there are no consumables like the usual potions and scrolls so while it keeps the game less cluttered it also reduces the variety of events and loot a lot. The only items are gear you wear/wield so you can get bigger numbers on your character sheet, sometimes you can get artifacts/runes which grant an extra skill. Simple, but gets grindy and boring. It doesn't help that you mostly have to do the same areas again when you make a new character, they get repetitive.\n\nThis game leans a bit more towards traditional RPGs because the lack of random craziness means that you usually die just when you get too cocky and proceed to a situation you can't handle and on the default difficulty you're allowed to make some mistakes. Characters seem to lead much longer lives than usually in roguelikes and a successful run takes something like 20 hours. I just wish it had more memorable and dynamic areas and enemies, but the class and skill system is still better than in most roguelikes.\n\nWhile there are many things that I don't like and I find the brutal unfair roguelikes more entertaining, I still think ToME is good. It's really fun to try out new character concepts and once you're getting bored with them there's something completely different you've unlocked and you start over.","March 21, 2014","true","43.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

The game is less based on randomness, and more on the story in the sense that there is no hunger meter, basically no item identification and the story is way more than just a filler reason for you to venture into dungeons. Speaking of dungeons, there are plenty of different locales and even an overworld. The levels are less random than say, in DCSS, but they're overall more interesting and varied.\n\nThe combat is otherwise traditional, except all your skills and spells (which there are plenty) use a cooldown-based system. The skills also work in more of a stat allocation kind of way (you get to choose skills which are determined by your class, and the skills themselves have prerequisites in the form of your stats, like Willpower or Strength, which you also put points into).\n\nThe items are also more RPG-y. There are many stats and mechanics that the items can affect, and the tooltips themselves look more like those found in MMOs.\n\nThere are many races and classes to choose from, although the majority of them are locked behind unlocks, which are another thing this game does differently; there are unlocks. I always kind of liked the idea of roguelikes giving you tons of options, and then throwing you in the deep end... Then you'd learn, and learning was what made you succesful. There is that in here still, too, but there are also unlocks tied into achievements, that give you a sense of progression other than learning from your mistakes. All in all, they're a nice addition and give something to work towards, if you like that kind of thing.\n\nMod support, and support in general. There are both, and they're done very well. Not only can you browse mods and even new campaigns for the engine on te4.org, there's also Steamworks integration if you purchase the donator version on Steam.\n\nOverall Tales of Maj'Eyal is a really great roguelike, with roots much closer to the genre than many of these rogulike-likes or so-called "rogue-lites". Oh and there's a great community, a wiki and even an integrated IRC inside the game, that you can use to chat with others currently playing... It announces the character deaths, too, so you can send your regards when you see that lvl 40 nightmare difficulty character go RIP.\n\nDid I mention it's free? Seriously, go get it.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, that the lore and character classes are really interesting, not your usual rogue/wizard/fighter archetypes (even though there are those, too).","June 30, 2014","true","40.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And I love it because of it. The game gives a feeling of challenge and forces you to learn all of its mechanics and tricks. Fail to remember any and you will quickly lose all of your lives.\n\nDid I mention that this game is a rogue-like? ToME is a game which has you create your own character picking one of the several races and classes. You can be a human warrior, an elven rogue, or even a halfling mage. The choice is yours. But don't get too attached to your character as they will very easily die. By default, your character is given only a few lives. Run out of them and it's game over. You either have to restart your character's entire story or make a new one. If perma-death or limited lives aren't your thing, there is an option to have infinite lives. But this removes a lot of the challenge in the game and you will not be able to get much of the game's NUMEROUS achievements.\n\nWhile this game has very minimalistic graphics and mostly comprises of still images for characters and objects, it gives a very reminiscent feel of old rogue-like dungeon crawlers. The art-style is a very interesting one but might not appeal to all people. Overall, the game is very well design and made. It has the right amount of challenge and design put into it. The game even has its own lore set and a very interesting world to study and explore. And if you are worried about any lack of replayability, there is a ton of it. All of the dungeons are randomly generated. There are a wide variety of ways to play this game and interesting combinations of characters you can make. And the number of achievements will have completionists at their desks for days trying to get them all. If you feel that the game is lacking a certain something, this game does have Workshop support. So if you wish to make a Vampire race or even make one of the enemy races playable, then you can. This game is very open to mods and highly encourages it.\n\nAll in all, this is a very well-made game that will have on the edge of your seat as you try to keep your character alive. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good old fashioned dungeon crawler or anyone who is looking for something new in the swamp of games that is the Steam store.","February 1, 2014","true","8.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's far fewer variables than nethack while still keeping everything complex and interesting. The graphics are alright for its genre.\n\nIf you want to try the game, get it from their website for free.

It's from the less wackyrandom branch of roguelikes so there's less stuff you have to learn by dying constantly and not so many unfair instadeaths. This can be a good thing if you don't like RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, but if you enjoy Nethack-type randomness more you might find this game a bit boring.\n\nThe best part of the game is the character development. There's tons of classes and races and while you start with the more usual ones like warriors and rogues, through game events you will unlock dozens more ranging from time-travellers to plague cultists with quite unique gameplay mechanics. There are tons of optional skill trees to unlock through quests so your characters will become quite varied.\n\nMinus points for the completely bland levels, monsters and itemization. There's an ADOM-type overworld map which ensures that not every area is a traditional dungeon, but the levels themselves are just plain boring with no interesting features. Then again the game does have a great auto-explore function so at least you don't have to slog through the dull mazes manually, this is a really good addition, you can fast-forward to the next encounter. Item-wise there are no consumables like the usual potions and scrolls so while it keeps the game less cluttered it also reduces the variety of events and loot a lot. The only items are gear you wear/wield so you can get bigger numbers on your character sheet, sometimes you can get artifacts/runes which grant an extra skill. Simple, but gets grindy and boring. It doesn't help that you mostly have to do the same areas again when you make a new character, they get repetitive.\n\nThis game leans a bit more towards traditional RPGs because the lack of random craziness means that you usually die just when you get too cocky and proceed to a situation you can't handle and on the default difficulty you're allowed to make some mistakes. Characters seem to lead much longer lives than usually in roguelikes and a successful run takes something like 20 hours. I just wish it had more memorable and dynamic areas and enemies, but the class and skill system is still better than in most roguelikes.\n\nWhile there are many things that I don't like and I find the brutal unfair roguelikes more entertaining, I still think ToME is good. It's really fun to try out new character concepts and once you're getting bored with them there's something completely different you've unlocked and you start over.","March 21, 2014","true","43.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Unlike most roguelikes, there's an overworld with towns, said overworld and said towns are not randomly generated, but have fixed layouts, only the dangerous areas that would loosely define as "dungeons" are random in layout. Each option feels quite different, and usually has a somewhat unique play style, with race choice as well as class. The game doesn't exactly feel unfair until mid to late levels when the adventure starts getting into ridiculous territory.\n\nVisuals for something as lightweight as this and static sprites are quite nice, there's some 3D effects and 2D effects based on special abilities being used, the sprites are large and detailed enough to know what you're facing before you mouse over it.\n\nControls are fairly simple, opting for an action bar where you can slot all your different items/abilities, which may deter some of the hardcore players of roguelikes. There's also mouse support, and right clicking on your character or other things allows one to play mostly with the mouse if one prefers.\n\nSound is present, there's music for every area, sounds for different attacks and special abilities, nothing to really write home about, but it's not bad.\n\nGame mechanics are fairly solid and scale up to the point of more or less halfling going toe to toe with kaiju god-slaying robot of death, though quite a few of the mechanics are not 100% intuitive, difficulty is pretty variable with lots of options. Achievements are a colossal pain in the ♥♥♥♥ though, as a result, as getting an achievement in one difficulty setting doesn't unlock it for any others, and a lot of the achievements have 12 variations or so based on difficulty settings. Will say that some randomly generated enemies can be impossible to kill, I had an issue with a named bone giant who was impossible to kill at the level cap with ridiculously strong abilities as a summoner.\n\nThe game also has a plot and rewards you for being a nice person or a total jerk as well. It's not super deep, but it's enjoyable.\n\nThe engine's moddable as well, I recall the official site having an eastern fantasy campaign.","March 18, 2015","true","70.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Given that I'll never play on anything but roguelike, that leaves me with a bunch of achievements I'll never get.\n\nOther than that, this is a great roguelike. It is class based so there are some choice moments when you really wish you could use that awesome item you found, but that's true of most of the genre. Most of what I've seen has been that good choices and skill synergy trumps RNG drops.\n\nStarting out, your choices are pretty limited. You need to fulfill certain requirements to unlock additional races and classes. Thankfully, these conditions aren't hard to fulfill and will (mostly) naturally happen as you progress through the game. I was kind of annoyed by that, but it did give me a chance to play around with some of the basic skill trees and get a feel for the combat styles in this game.\n\nIf you do pick this up, I'd recommend taking a look at some of the add-ons like the advanced item compare, better escorts and improved sorting.

So with that in mind, this is my "first" review. My experience within this game is limited (37.9 hrs at time of post), but my time with this game may be much more when looked at in the future. Now lets get to the meat of the review, the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n+Great, meticulous tactical gameplay\n+An intricate skill tree system (Which can be expanded through various events)\n+Unforgiving (given that it is a rougelike game)\n+Dedicated support from DarkGod, the sole developer (He has been working on this game for over 17 years!)\n+Good support for mods and addons\n+Enticing lore! The world feels very alive and the stories are very well thought out.\n+Fun and deep character creation, especially as you unlock classes and races\n+Interesting classes (I bet your other RPGs don't have Oozemancers or Temproal Wardens!)\n+A good community\n+Very challenging and it will test your abilities\n+The game can be downloaded for free on its website. You won't have access to some small features but you can unlock those by donating money to DarkGod. Otherwise, you can just buy through Steam and get those goodies right off the bat, like I did.\n+An exploration mode with infinate lives. You can accustom yourself to the game and tinker with various builds and whatnot (This is a special perk for those who donate should you download it from its website)\n+Alternative modes to play should you get bored of the main story lines (Infinite Dungeon and Arena)\n\nCons:\n\n-Graphics are quite dated but this is largely a non-issue. The developer started working on this game in the late 1990s so the engine that the game runs on is very old. Could potentially deter gamers who have only really experienced more recent games like Skyrim, Diablo 3, etc. But you know, their loss.\n-Can be rage inducing. The amount of times you die is ridiculous and due to the RNG within the game, you can get very unlucky and run into a monster or mob that erases your pixelated ♥♥♥. But hey, you knew what you signed up for ;)\n-Bugs, crashing, etc. Though these are rare, there have been hiccups which might kill you or just cause you to crash. (I know of one with a passive which allows you to speed up immensely for a short time after killing an enemy and moving with it may cause your game to crash. It has happened to me many times but it was just an annoyance since I set back to my previous save point) It's minor, but something to keep in mind since you can be punished brutally if you make a mistake.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is just a great game and one that recieves so much love. Being someone who is relatively new to the "Rougelike" genre of games, this game has got me hooked! Outside of the few minor annoyances, this is a full, flushed out game. This thing has recieved more time and dedication than most marriages do in the U.S. (lol) There is so much story and content to this game, most of which I have yet to experience for myself. This game is frustrating in the best of ways. It drives you to go further, try new classes, races, etc. DarkGod (from what I have seen and heard) is very active and continues to work on content for this game. One example is the new expansion he released in February, "Embers of Rage" and he has hinted at more expansions that he is or will be working on in the future. He also will create special events in the game and play with those currently playing. I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to those who enjoy a good RPG or rougelike game.

You get much more content for your money than any other game I've seen before. With a huge variety of unique classes and races you can form your own playstyle and stick to it; Or otherwise you can explore, discovering little bits and pieces of the huge world though the races' personal stories and some class unique events.\n\nYou can get it for free on their website if you don't want to buy it. I got it on sale for 1.80$ and I don't regret it one bit. It's worth so much more than the full price, you're basically getting charged pocket money for what it is.

Much Strats, Little Mercy. Victory Sweet.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal. -sigh- I said I would write a review for this game when I beat it. Well I just edged over six hundred hours and finally have won. There really isn't much more to cover. The tags show it's a rogue-like, the videos give you a solid understanding of what to expect, and the user base has voted it overwhelmingly positive. So instead, I'm going to explain the emotional aspects of the game.  TOME (Tales of Maj'Eyal) will make you feel dead inside. I've litteraly taken a skirmisher over the course of thirty hours into the second to the last room and died. Boom, save deleted. Can you handle that? I couldn't, that was around hour mark 400. I couldn't sleep, I'm not kidding, when you die TOME plays this little dun dun dunn tone. I had no idea I was about to die, the moment the screen flicked red and that tune played, well, I broke out into a sweat. My friend was over visiting from the other side of the state and that is the only reason I didn't freak out into a felonious rage. Now you gotta understand, that was one death of many. Your victories are few and far between in TOME, you refight the same bosses over and over and over, it doesn't matter how much content there is in the game, you will feel almost no reward for killing alt minotaur for the hundreath time. You'll rage through the sandworms annoyed that you have to think with every move rather than autopiloting. When you're sucked into the fearscape with a fire specd character you'll understand fear and if you get out alive you just return to the motions. After hundreds of hours of hundreds of deaths you finally get to the last boss. Then you win. I've been smiling for two days now, I think on winning and just grin. I can't help it. It's probably the most rewarding victory I've ever had in a game. Puts emerald or ruby weapon to shame. Six hundred hours for this feeling. Then you take it off normal mode and switch to nightmare difficulty and die in the starting area. So basically what I'm saying is, how well do you know yourself? Is this a goal worth your time? It was for me.\n\nSome Quick Notes for Noobs:\nZ: This hotkey will rest your character and autoexplore. Use at your own risk.\nP: This pulls up all the talent trees so you can plan for the future.\nI: Inventory, big suprise.\nF1 and F2: These toggle between the golem and the alchemist if you play that class.\nCaps Lock: This enables free viewing on the map so you can arrow key around.\nTab: Blows up the map so you can see it better, enemies you know of will be marked on it.\nOptions Menu: In this menu you can turn off the autopick tool for your skill and stat points at creation.\n","June 24, 2015","true","939.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Lets start at the begining. I am an old-school gamer at heart. I started gaming in the early 80's and was only recently introduced to the roguelike genre, which has actually been my favorite genre for about 2 years now. I know Rogue was put out in 80 or 81, but for whatever reason I never got into this genre (perhaps it is because I played alot of consoles at that time?). My first introduction to roguelikes was BoI, among other actual 'roguelites'.\n\nAnyways, I know the whole Berlin Interpretation of what a roguelike is, but really in the sense of ToME and others, it is just a great RPG with permadeath. This requires you to really take your time and think about your actions. Playing drunk, or while on the phone is certain death, am-I-right?\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal has a really neat universe set in place, with a great UI that is all keyboard based (although you can use the mouse, it is debatably less efficient). Compared to other 'true' roguelikes, this game has a great tileset and overall graphics that are very much appreciated. When you equip armor, so does your avatar. There is rain, mist, etc.\n\nKeep in mind you can get this game for free from the developers website, but you shouldn't. Donate, or buy it on Steam (basically a donation). Pay for it because this is top notch game developement. YOU WILL GET DOZENS OF HOURS OUT OF THIS. At least.\n\nIt is not multiplayer, but it is the first MSORPG... Thats right - Massive Single Player Online RPG. Its brilliant. You play your own game, yet are in constant chat with the rest of the world. There is even some sort of item sharing in this chat that I haven't used yet. Best part - no need for a Wiki - I simply ask a questions (I've asked dozens) and some kind soul always has an awesome response. Awesome community that is very helpful.\n\nTL;DR\n\n10/10 This is how game developement is done.","October 30, 2014","true","26.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

The skill system is one of them. You can choose multiple skills, but you have a limited amount of skill points. Some really stand out, while others may seem underwhelming. Every single skill has a purpose in one way or another, and has a use.\n\nThe class system is another one. There are 10 races in the base game, all with different skills. You start with a small handful, and can unlock the others by playing the game. There are 26 classes with different playstyles in the regular game, 19 of those unlockable by playing the game as well. There's one "bonus" class that can get any skill from any tree in the game, and you unlock that one by beating the game once. DLC adds 5 more classes, and 4 different races to play as.\n\nThere's also little risk to trying this game out. There are some features only people who purchase the game get, but they are mostly cosmetic, and in one case it's a new class. You can get the demo on the developer's website, and have access to the entire base game. The bonus class is quite fun to play as, and the DLC just adds more stuff.\n\nAnd in the case of Rage of Embers, it's an entirely new campaign to play.","February 27","true","36.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

What it is instead is a classical steep-learning-curve, hard-to-master roguelike with some surprisingly deep, well thought out game mechanics.\n\nIf you're looking for a challenge or even simply an ARPG with an incredible replay value - randomly generated zones, huge number of interesting races and classes with their unique gameplay, 3 gameplay modes between the campaign, the arena and the infinite dungeon - you're looking in the right place. You can even choose your own flavor away from difficulty setting by deciding not to play a roguelike at all but instead venture into exploration mode and simply discover the world of Eyal with lives to spare. Oh, and let me mention the wonderful, always spot-on soundtrack too. You'll know what I mean when entering the arena.\n\nNow, as far as flaws go.. ToME comes with surprisingly little (and even less that some addon, readily available in the workshop, can't fix for you). There's the odd balance or fumbling with the UI issue and 'graphic that could have been this tad better' but these minor troubles do tend to pale in comparison to the overall expirience and the number of for-your-convenience features the game brings, some of which - like the 'auto use when' function that for example automatically starts up your sustained abilities under specified conditions - I would have wished for in AA genre titles.\n\nOverall ToME is an incredible achievement not only but especially by an indie developer and I would highly urge every genre fan to give it a spin. Just beware: it might suck you in and it probably won't let go again any time soon. ;)","April 26","true","48.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Tales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) simply offers the best roguelike experience one could get: deep, nuanced gameplay that is not only highly customizable and replayable but also accessible to even someone who's new to the genre.\n\nOne of the greatest hurdles that roguelike games have in appealing to the mainstream is the massive complexity that can be seen in some roguelikes. ToME, in fact, is a testament to this - featuring the most number of unique classes that I've ever seen in a game, all of which have differing playstyles and specializations, ranging from the ever-reliable warrior to shield-bearing mages manipulating earth magic to combat alchemists controlling massive golems. In most roguelikes, this complexity is rarely explained - and some would attest to finding out what X item is for as a part of the roguelike charm. What makes ToME remarkable, though, is making this complexity as accessible as possible. The tooltips for each skill, talent, or item not only gives concise, pertinent information that is easily understandable but even features some lore or description - which, in combination with in-game lore fleshes out a massive and detailed world.\n\nThe graphics also are very pleasing. They obviously are not as polished or as pretty like the Endless series (Dungeon of the Endless etc), but the individual NPC/PC tiles have a tabletop RPG feel and further help flesh the world out with great visuals. The sound shines through in this game - the background music for each zone fits the zone's theme well without distracting the player.\n\nReplayability is also one of the major criteria that roguelikes are measured with. ToME is, in all seriousness, the absolute best value game - there are so many race and class combinations you can try, and within one class there are several ways of playing. A great non-spoiler example of this would be the Rogue, which can focus on hit-and-run stealth tactics, using debilitating poisons and tricks to bring down enemies to their knees, or using a variety of traps to contain and damage foes. One of the absolute best examples of this would be (spoiler) the melee/ranged hybrid Temporal Warden class, which simply has so many options and gameplay styles: Bounce around the map, doing damage and teleporting out of sight all in the blink of an eye (Threaded Combat); Summon entities to fight with you (Temporal Hounds); Bend space and time to prevent damage to you and stop enemies in their tracks (Stasis); or even focus your attacks on one enemy as you seal their fate (Fate Weaving). There's simply so many things you can try that even with a non-procedural map and game flow there is still almost limitless replayability to the game - if you can beat it, that is!\n\nI've played roguelikes for a long while - coming from classics like Angband, to modern games that stretch the limits of the genre such as Dungeon of the Endless and Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, and to modern reimaginings and improvements on the genre - where games like Elona and ToME fall. While most modern roguelikes stretch the definition and innovate the genre in so many ways, ToME sticks close to the genre's roots and provides a high quality, high value gameplay experience. Thus, Tales of Maj'Eyal stands tall as the absolute best that the roguelike genre can offer.","May 24","true","80.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Every time I went hunting for a new roguelike, I'd find ToME, look at the screenshots, wrinkle my nose at the tileset, and move on.\n\nA combination of peer pressure and exasperation at the four million half-baked early access games I'm waiting on finally tipped me over the edge to get it -- and I'm glad I did. Finally. I've been missing a lot of fun.\n\nSo! Here's what I'm digging about ToME:\n\n1. Maybe this is mentioned in the reviews for it, and I've just somehow always glossed over it, but ToME has a really interesting set of skills that rely on various energy bars, cooldowns, and other variables. Even my very-straight-forward berserker has a hopping action bar that's a handful to manage. Honestly, it reminds me (pleasantly) of MMO combat. Just, you know, without the ganking, loot drama, time commitment, spouse aggro, RSI...\n\n2. It's not early access. Invictus, I take back every eye-roll I ever aimed at you for avoiding the early access games I'd recommend to you, because I'm there now. Holy mother of pogo-jumping Christ, is it pleasant to play a game that's finished and working and not possibly maybe someday in the future going to not suck, honest.\n\n3. There's a global chat where everyone currently playing ToME can talk with eachother. I'm really enjoying this, even though it's usually just a ticker for achievements and the new and exciting ways people are finding to die. Occasionally conversations or questions will spring up. Feeling like a single-player game has a shared community is a new thing to me, I guess.\n\nI only have two quibbles with the game, and they're utterly cosmetic: some of the tunes aren't so hot (and all of them are short enough that the repetition wears on you very quickly), and I really don't like the tileset. It's what has put me off getting the game multiple times over the past years. They're too complex to hit my pixel-art happy buttons, and too amateurish to look good. It's some kinda tepid middle-ground, designed-by-committee tileset that makes Baby Jesus cry.\n\nAnd I'm having so much fun with it that I can look past it. If you like roguelikes at all, get it.

Every time I went hunting for a new roguelike, I'd find ToME, look at the screenshots, wrinkle my nose at the tileset, and move on.\n\nA combination of peer pressure and exasperation at the four million half-baked early access games I'm waiting on finally tipped me over the edge to get it -- and I'm glad I did. Finally. I've been missing a lot of fun.\n\nSo! Here's what I'm digging about ToME:\n\n1. Maybe this is mentioned in the reviews for it, and I've just somehow always glossed over it, but ToME has a really interesting set of skills that rely on various energy bars, cooldowns, and other variables. Even my very-straight-forward berserker has a hopping action bar that's a handful to manage. Honestly, it reminds me (pleasantly) of MMO combat. Just, you know, without the ganking, loot drama, time commitment, spouse aggro, RSI...\n\n2. It's not early access. Invictus, I take back every eye-roll I ever aimed at you for avoiding the early access games I'd recommend to you, because I'm there now. Holy mother of pogo-jumping Christ, is it pleasant to play a game that's finished and working and not possibly maybe someday in the future going to not suck, honest.\n\n3. There's a global chat where everyone currently playing ToME can talk with eachother. I'm really enjoying this, even though it's usually just a ticker for achievements and the new and exciting ways people are finding to die. Occasionally conversations or questions will spring up. Feeling like a single-player game has a shared community is a new thing to me, I guess.\n\nI only have two quibbles with the game, and they're utterly cosmetic: some of the tunes aren't so hot (and all of them are short enough that the repetition wears on you very quickly), and I really don't like the tileset. It's what has put me off getting the game multiple times over the past years. They're too complex to hit my pixel-art happy buttons, and too amateurish to look good. It's some kinda tepid middle-ground, designed-by-committee tileset that makes Baby Jesus cry.\n\nAnd I'm having so much fun with it that I can look past it. If you like roguelikes at all, get it.

As in, you shouldn't really count of ToME in the same group as Nethack, ADoM, or even Crawl. ToME is, first of all, much more focused on combat. There is no hunger, very little inventory management, very few ways (none?) to lose your character outside of actual combat.\n\n(for clarity: bump attack means an automatic attack that happens as your character attempts to enter a space occupied by a hostile character. Yeah, autoattack)\n\nThe combat doesn't much remind the bump/cast combat of most roguelikes. It's more like WoW, turn based. And I don't mean this in a bad way. Most turns you have to use skills even as a melee character, as opposed to bump attacking like you probably would in most actual roguelikes. There are a lot of skills, considering the game currently has at least 25 classes, many of which have multiple unique skill lines (each containing 4 skills).\n\nNow, let's get this out of the way: the game is free, unless you really want to buy it on Steam, or otherwise. The game is also easily worth the Steam price, and much more besides. A single playthrough can be easily over 10 hours, and the game has a lot of replayability. It is fun.\n\nDownsides? Having played this a lot (though not nearly as much as some), I'd say: the normal difficulty is way too easy, with some exceptions. The higher difficulties aren't viable on some classes (the higher you go, the less viable melee is, in general), and getting oneshot becomes increasingly an issue. There are ways to deal with getting oneshot, but they usually involve tedious gameplay. Like, using certain spells to check what's behind every corner, always. I personally *hate* playing like that, so currently I can either play on too easy difficulties, or play on challenging difficulties with random oneshotting mobs. Mind, you can easily get several playthroughs (like, 30h+) worth playtime before encountering this issue.\n\nErm.. so yeah.

I buy anything and everything that tickles my fancy. About a quarter of my purchases are terrible, horrible mistakes (The Guild II, 7 Days to Die, etc.) that never get more than an hour's playtime before I uninstall them in disgust. I always regret buying those games, but that's the price of window shopping.\n\nThen there are the games that are decent for a playthrough, maybe two, before I move on and forget about them. They tend to be solid games (Shadows of Mordor, Two Worlds II, Shadowrun, etc.) but nothing to write home about. They make up a good 65% of my library.\n\nThe last 10% are absolute masterpieces, that I will never tire of playing. I'm happy to say that ToME fits snugly into this category. I purchased it due to its aggregated review score and its resemblance to Dwarf Fortress, expecting that I'd get a week or two of enjoyment out of it before I got bored and moved on. Well, let me tell you, that is not going to happen.\n\nIn a nutshell, I'd describe ToME as a streamlined version of Dwarf Fortress adventure mode, with the emphasis shifted from proc-gen content to coherent and enjoyable adventures. Now, I know that some DF purists will be turned off by that description - after all, procedurally-generated worlds and histories are a big part of DF's appeal, aren't they? - but bear with me.\n\nWhereas DF uses proc-gen to determine EVERYTHING, from cultures to the landmass to an individual's fascination with cheese[mikaelisaksson.com], ToME uses it sparingly. The world map, quests, and bosses stay relatively constant from playthrough to playthrough (though there are occasionally some small variations in the last category). This has allowed DarkGod (the one-man dev team behind ToME) to build an extremely long, complex, and open-ended plotline that will see players through 50 experience levels - and for the record, if you play roguelike mode, you'll have a hell of a time even breaking 20.\n\nWhere proc-gen is used, it is used very gracefully. All dungeons randomize their layouts (and to a lesser extent, their themes) for each new playthrough, and gear, with the notable exception of the rare, unique items, is also random. Minibosses, which randomly appear throughout dungeons after the initial quest has been completed, are all named, given a random race (anything from masses of worms to furry little Ewok slave-drivers), and given an arbitrary group of abilities. To put it simply, though the broad strokes of the game are fixed, the details of every run will be distinct and unique.\n\nThere`s one more aspect of the game that bears mentioning in reference to encouraging multiple playthroughs, and that`s character design. When you first start the game, approximately 75% of the classes, 50% of the races, and 66% of the game modes will be locked. Mind you, that still leaves you with something like 7 races and a dozen classes to choose from. As you complete certain events, various aspects of the game will be unlocked for future playthroughs. There`s nothing more exciting than unlocking a class encouraging an entirely new playstyle after a long, epic campaign.\n\nEven within a single class, the room for freedom of choice is incredible. Every class has somewhere between 30-60 skills associated with it, each of which has five levels of expertise. In addition, you receive another 30 or so skills to choose from based on your race. Considering that even in a perfect playthrough, you`re only likely to get 160 skill points or so, you`ll never be wanting for new ideas for character builds. It bears mentioning that on top of all of this, there are ways to learn the skills of other classes too.\n\nI'm going to end this review with a quick pro/con list, since those are all the rage on Steam these days.\n\nPROS\n\n-Nearly infinite replay value\n-Strong RPG elements\n-Farscape references. The world needs more Farscape.\n-Moody, atmospheric music\n-Incredibly detailed character creator\n-Moddable\n-Dedicated community and dev\n-Lore-a-licious. If you like fictional worlds with a lot of backstory, you'll enjoy your time on Eyal.\n-Surprisingly complex combat system, even for boring old sword-and-board builds\n-No shortage of humour, without being a farce\n-The option to play as a latex-clad Dwarven gimp with a wooden paddle\n\nCONS\n\n-Most people will count the tile-based graphics as a con, though I find them pleasantly nostalgic\n-Less complex than DF (pretty sure that applies to every game, though)\n-The initial dungeons become old rather quickly for roguelike players, despite being randomized each time\n-The randomized mini-bosses can occasionally feel a little unbalanced (in either direction)\n-I can't play it 24/7","February 2, 2015","true","40.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fairly forgiving, in that you can start on easy mode, with unlimited lives (but no achievements) to figure things out, then once you've got the hang of it, you can change it up to a harder version.\n\nIf you're someone who has to get every achievemnt though, this game will take a LOT of your time. I first got it from DarGod's website, played it for a hundered plus hours, then heard it was on steam, so I bought it here too (on a friends shared account) and started playing it. I earned a hundred or so achievements before I just started playing under my account. And then I realized that I had to re-earn those achievements. I felt better when I realized that those hundred I earned? not even 15% of the total possible. Yeah, that's right, there's not 100, not 200, but over 1300 achievements for this game.\n\nSo like I said if you need to have EVERY achievement, this will take you some time, especially since at least one of the achievements is nearly impossible. You have to beat the optional boss, who is a super archmage/god (not kidding about that, it's part of the amazing in-depth lore of this game) on the hardest difficulty setting, with one life. Oh yeah, and she can come back to life a few times. Oh, and she gets stronger each time she does it. And she is in the middle of a town full of mages, who also attack you. But at least you can attack first, right?\n\nSo for those who don't want to spend the next 3 years trying to get that achievement, it's still an amazing game, with good graphics (for a roguelike) a great story, fun unlock systems, and interesting combat. All that, and it was developed by one guy! Props DarkGod, your minions salute you!","December 27, 2014","true","61.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No, this isn't a great looking game. If you're looking for smooth animation, amazing visuals, flashy effects, etc., you won't find them here. The music isn't great (I play with it muted and one of the many video game and movie soundtracks I have on itunes playing in the background), and sometimes the ambience is a little annoying (whoever owns the dog that barks nonstop in every city needs to put a muzzle on it or something). Now, for the good things. The gameplay is hard as nails, unforgiving, confusing at times, and all around frustratingly hard, as any good roguelike should be. You have to option to play with more lives, even infinite lives, but I always play on the "roguelike" mode, where you only have one life, unless you find more. Knowing what is happening around you at all times is a must in this game, as losing focus of even one enemy can mean death, as I learned the hard way in my most recent death (opened a door, orc necromancer on the other side, managed to escape at first, but on my way back to see if I could get around him, was flanked by his summoned army of skeletons and ghouls). This is a true roguelike, with everything happening in turns as you wander through forests and dungeons, killing everything in your path, picking up loot, buying weapons and armour, and, when you make a mistake, dying with no continues or reloads (at least on roguelike mode).

While there IS a mode which allows infinite respawns, it rather defeats the point of the game, which is twofold:\n\n1.) Death is permanant.\n2.) Every world is randomly generated and different. (Within certain parameters, obviously. The Wood Elf's always gonna start in a randomly generated forest area and the Dwarf's always going to start in a randomly generated cave. This is because even the people who made this game realize that it would be a bit absurd to face down a level 1068 demon from hell when you start out in your underpants with a weapon stolen from the toy shop.)\n\nPoor Jimmy the Dwarf Warrior never even made it out of the starter cave. But Mahariel, the Elf Archer chick I've  been running lately has consistently lived over an hour. This might sound a bit frustrating, but it also lends a fresh air of discovery everytime you play. And in that sense, it's probably the standard that all Fantasy RPGs should be held to. Not just indie ten dollar or less titles, but the big A-Listers like Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, and the like. (If things feel mundane in a FANTASY game, something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.) With minimalist graphics and a shoestring budget, Tales of Maj'Eyal manages to remain engrossing and compelling throughout with evocative music and little smatterings of lore, alongside gameplay that rejects the handholding most games these days embrace. ToME does not hold your hand. It punches you in the testicles. That said, no game is perfect, so here is my criticism.\n\nOne of the general problems with the old school/minimalist vibe they're going for is that your character never really has their place in the world defined. You're just sort of there, playing around in this big sandbox with no real connections to it. You never have an uncle or a sister or a friend or whatever that serves as an anchor. The closest thing you get to party members are ineffective, personality-devoid asshats you have to escort to exit zones in repetitive sidequests you'll never pass up because the rewards are too damned good to turn down. But interpersonal interaction? Forget it. NPCs are just like "Hey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, go do this for the XP and bonuses so you can do slightly harder stuff for the next ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥," and you're like "sure" and that's that. You just run around going on quests, killing stuff and getting loot because that's how pimps roll, I guess. Of course, one or two half-♥♥♥♥♥ excuses aside, Skyrim isn't much better in this regard, so I suppose it might not be fair to blame the presentation for this.\n\nThe thing is, with all this lore and stuff they dangle in front of your nose, explaining the truth behind the Orc genocide or the politics behind the human-halfling alliance, or the hatreds between the two elven peoples, the fact that none of it really has to do with your interactions with other people, who serve only as quest givers or static decoration, really gives one the off-putting feeling that you have shown up to a party five minutes after it ended.\n\nUltimately, the main character of the game is the world of Maj'Eyal itself and your interaction with it, and it is a compelling world which will be new everytime you play it. The immersive vibe you get from exploring a new bit of dark wilderness or dungeon with moody music playing in the background is excellent, and the lore documents encompass sad, hilarious, and terrifying without skipping a beat. It is a shame that the epic immersion Maj'Eyal offers is strained by the two-dimensional clods who inhabit it, but hey, it's a Roguelike, what were you expecting, War and Peace? Just get the damned game.","March 17, 2014","true","172.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unncessary complexities that might otherwise make a turn-based dungeon crawler tedious are streamlined using functionalities like auto-explore, auto-cast, and auto-sell. At the same time, the game retains all the complexities related character customization and strategy. There are 25 classes, and nearly all of them play very differently from the others. Adding to the strategic depth is the amount of effects the environment can have on a character, from vision blocked by fog to getting crushed by collasping walls to suffocated in water. The dungeon design makes great use of these elements. There is always something new to look forward to when you start a new game, which is a great news, because the game is challenging enough that it's only a matter of time before your first character runs out of lives.","April 19, 2014","true","120.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For a game of this magnitude, my limited gametime is a drop in the comparative ocean. However in these 14 hours I have enjoyed countless adventures and hence feel the need to express my feelings towards this game.\n\nTOME is a Roguelike in its purest form; that said, it is the formula of dungeons within dungeons and static set pieces that allow its narrative to shine. This is not a game of simply smashing your way through numbers to obtain numbers to increase your numbers this is seen in many RPGS and hack'n'slashes;  there is a rich layer of lore found in conversations as well as scrolls and other objects that add a level of depth and immersion that many other "have a quick go" Roguelikes lack somewhat. Make no mistake, this game is a labour of love.\n\nDespite the level of depth and complexity, TOME is incredibly easy to pick up and play; most aspects of playing are self explanatory. Items and their inherent effects are explained concisely and character sheets are detailed but not cluttered to the point of being rendered unusuable. The inventory is forgiving and even offers to empty itself for you after every floor of a dungeon, eliminating annoying overencumbered messages.\n\nAs stated previously I have amassed 14 hours in this game; in this space of time I have had a measly 1 character exceed level 10. This is a difficult game, an attribute which may put players off but attracts me all the more. Sometimes deaths leave you feeling cheated, especially random encounters in the overworld where an enemy caster can easily 2 or 3 shot an unprepared player from afar; this is countered by the player being transported to another plane upon death by a being of great power. The player then has the choice of being teleported to somewhere safer or dropped back into the fight rejuevenated. I would be lying if I said the latter act of manning up didn't cost me more than one decent character.\n\nWIth the huge amount of races, talent trees, classes etc character creation is a powerful tool and allows you to progress in many different directions. Want a Cursed Elf? Check. Dwarven Alchemist with his own pet Golem? K. Halfling carrying out his own Hellish agenda of slaughter? Got it. Options such as these, the item system and the procedural world give the game practically unending longevity.\n\nIf you can say yes to enjoying Roguelikes, turn based battle, thoughtful strategy, massive replayability and a deep fantasy setting, TOME is a worthy purchase for you.","May 23, 2015","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While there IS a mode which allows infinite respawns, it rather defeats the point of the game, which is twofold:\n\n1.) Death is permanant.\n2.) Every world is randomly generated and different. (Within certain parameters, obviously. The Wood Elf's always gonna start in a randomly generated forest area and the Dwarf's always going to start in a randomly generated cave. This is because even the people who made this game realize that it would be a bit absurd to face down a level 1068 demon from hell when you start out in your underpants with a weapon stolen from the toy shop.)\n\nPoor Jimmy the Dwarf Warrior never even made it out of the starter cave. But Mahariel, the Elf Archer chick I've  been running lately has consistently lived over an hour. This might sound a bit frustrating, but it also lends a fresh air of discovery everytime you play. And in that sense, it's probably the standard that all Fantasy RPGs should be held to. Not just indie ten dollar or less titles, but the big A-Listers like Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, and the like. (If things feel mundane in a FANTASY game, something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.) With minimalist graphics and a shoestring budget, Tales of Maj'Eyal manages to remain engrossing and compelling throughout with evocative music and little smatterings of lore, alongside gameplay that rejects the handholding most games these days embrace. ToME does not hold your hand. It punches you in the testicles. That said, no game is perfect, so here is my criticism.\n\nOne of the general problems with the old school/minimalist vibe they're going for is that your character never really has their place in the world defined. You're just sort of there, playing around in this big sandbox with no real connections to it. You never have an uncle or a sister or a friend or whatever that serves as an anchor. The closest thing you get to party members are ineffective, personality-devoid asshats you have to escort to exit zones in repetitive sidequests you'll never pass up because the rewards are too damned good to turn down. But interpersonal interaction? Forget it. NPCs are just like "Hey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, go do this for the XP and bonuses so you can do slightly harder stuff for the next ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥," and you're like "sure" and that's that. You just run around going on quests, killing stuff and getting loot because that's how pimps roll, I guess. Of course, one or two half-♥♥♥♥♥ excuses aside, Skyrim isn't much better in this regard, so I suppose it might not be fair to blame the presentation for this.\n\nThe thing is, with all this lore and stuff they dangle in front of your nose, explaining the truth behind the Orc genocide or the politics behind the human-halfling alliance, or the hatreds between the two elven peoples, the fact that none of it really has to do with your interactions with other people, who serve only as quest givers or static decoration, really gives one the off-putting feeling that you have shown up to a party five minutes after it ended.\n\nUltimately, the main character of the game is the world of Maj'Eyal itself and your interaction with it, and it is a compelling world which will be new everytime you play it. The immersive vibe you get from exploring a new bit of dark wilderness or dungeon with moody music playing in the background is excellent, and the lore documents encompass sad, hilarious, and terrifying without skipping a beat. It is a shame that the epic immersion Maj'Eyal offers is strained by the two-dimensional clods who inhabit it, but hey, it's a Roguelike, what were you expecting, War and Peace? Just get the damned game.","March 17, 2014","true","172.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every time I went hunting for a new roguelike, I'd find ToME, look at the screenshots, wrinkle my nose at the tileset, and move on.\n\nA combination of peer pressure and exasperation at the four million half-baked early access games I'm waiting on finally tipped me over the edge to get it -- and I'm glad I did. Finally. I've been missing a lot of fun.\n\nSo! Here's what I'm digging about ToME:\n\n1. Maybe this is mentioned in the reviews for it, and I've just somehow always glossed over it, but ToME has a really interesting set of skills that rely on various energy bars, cooldowns, and other variables. Even my very-straight-forward berserker has a hopping action bar that's a handful to manage. Honestly, it reminds me (pleasantly) of MMO combat. Just, you know, without the ganking, loot drama, time commitment, spouse aggro, RSI...\n\n2. It's not early access. Invictus, I take back every eye-roll I ever aimed at you for avoiding the early access games I'd recommend to you, because I'm there now. Holy mother of pogo-jumping Christ, is it pleasant to play a game that's finished and working and not possibly maybe someday in the future going to not suck, honest.\n\n3. There's a global chat where everyone currently playing ToME can talk with eachother. I'm really enjoying this, even though it's usually just a ticker for achievements and the new and exciting ways people are finding to die. Occasionally conversations or questions will spring up. Feeling like a single-player game has a shared community is a new thing to me, I guess.\n\nI only have two quibbles with the game, and they're utterly cosmetic: some of the tunes aren't so hot (and all of them are short enough that the repetition wears on you very quickly), and I really don't like the tileset. It's what has put me off getting the game multiple times over the past years. They're too complex to hit my pixel-art happy buttons, and too amateurish to look good. It's some kinda tepid middle-ground, designed-by-committee tileset that makes Baby Jesus cry.\n\nAnd I'm having so much fun with it that I can look past it. If you like roguelikes at all, get it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/recommended/259680/","girlkillscomputer","Girl Kills Computer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/","158 products in account","I've been playing roguelikes since the late 80s, early 90s, starting with Nethack when I was a young girl.  Later, I discovered ADOM, and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.  It took me a while to warm up to Angband and its variants, cause I was used to "Hacklikes", which are fundamentally pretty different games.  I'll be using the terminology "*Bands" to refer to the latter, the * meaning put whatever you like there.  Games like Angband, Zangband, Cthangband, Animeband, Hengband, etc.  I'm going to do some comparing, because in order to understand why you should play ToME, some history and context is useful.  You've gotta know what you're getting into, here.\n\nComparing Hacklikes to *Bands is a lot like comparing X-Wing Vs. Tie Fighter to X3.  Roguelikes aren't generally "fast-paced" (with the exception of some wonderful titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer), but when I say that Hacklikes are faster than *Bands, what I mean is the planned length of a successful game is much shorter.  You can beat Nethack in a determined afternoon if you know exactly what you're doing and get a bit lucky.  *Bands are designed to be played for hundreds of hours before completion.  This distinction wasn't apparent to me until I got a bit older and explored the *Bands more thoroughly, because at first I just found them boring and samey.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal (and how do you even say that out loud?) is, historically and in spirit, a *Band game.  It used to be called Tales of Middle Earth, and was based on a game called UMoria, which is in turn an Angband variant.  For ToME 4, they discarded the Tolkein and created all new lore from scratch, and changed a LOT of features.  This is largely the ToME that you'll be playing if you buy this game.\n\nSo, what characterizes a *Band, and ToME in particular?  What kind of games are these?\n\nWhereas in Hacklikes, you are pressed forward by limited resources and infinitely spawning monsters, in a *Band, the game flow is based around infinite resources.  Take food, for example.  In most if not all Hacklikes, your character becomes hungry over time at a pretty good clip, and you have to find food or you will die.  So, much of the early game becomes about knowing which monster corpses are safe or even beneficial to eat, as well as locating non-perishable foods such as rations (which are in turn quite heavy in bulk, necessitating inventory management of very limited space).\n\nIn *Bands, you also get hungry, but the rate at which you do is very very slow compared to Hacklikes.  Monsters generally don't leave corpses, and you can always buy rations in town, which you can always get back to easily with a scroll of recall.  Hacklikes generally have no such spells or scrolls (if they have towns at all), and shop inventory is very limited and, depending on the game, usually does not restock.\n\nHunger is, however, a mechanic that later on becomes almost a non-issue in winning Hacklike runs.  There exist items that can slow digestion or produce infinite or near-infinite food in most all Hacklikes, such that the hunger mechanic mostly kills off early characters or very unlucky midrange characters.  And in *Bands, I'm a relative noob, but I've still never lost a character due to hunger.\n\nSo, why even have a hunger mechanic, then?  The developer of ToME probably asked himself that very question, and did away with hunger for ToME 4.  This is only one of many smoothed out, streamlined mechanics that fully embrace the *Band / infinite resources heritage of ToME and make it more accessible for newcomers.  There are also no unidentified items, for instance, and the game offers you an "adventure" mode where you have more than one life, or an "exploration" mode that's unlocked and visible right from the start, with infinite lives.  Of course, I'm bullheaded and old-school, so I only play on "roguelike" mode, where dead is dead.  But you might find you have wiggle room in other modes to learn more per character.\n\nYou're still going to die a lot, especially if you play anything other than a Bulwark.  But the classes are very interesting, and the lore is very well-written and interesting.  You gradually unlock more birth options (for new characters) as you play and find certain sidequests, but nothing else is persistent between runs, unlike many of the rogue-lites and mystery dungeon type games that have been popular lately.  This is a very hardcore, old-school roguelike of the *Band lineage.  You'll be playing any particular character for a very long time, growing attached to them and overcoming many challenges before dying horribly 100 hours from now because you got stupid for a second.  And then you're going to start over, because it's insanely fun.\n\nAlchemists in particular are probably my favorite class so far: You get a golem that you can equip and that has laser eyes and charges into battle to take hits for you while you throw grenades from the back lines.  I like to name mine after my boyfriend.  Summoners are also a lot of fun: you can throw wolves at peoples' faces, and summon dragons and minotaurs to kill things while your turtle tanks for you.  But I really recommend playing Bulwark or maybe Berserker to start: they're much less flimsy (Bulwarks in particular, they're the sword/mace/axe and board characters) and will let you learn more and accomplish more birth unlocks per run.\n\nHealing is accomplished through cooldown abilities rather than limited items, and you have a lot of options for talent specs to build even a particular class in very different ways.  Different races have very useful and interesting bonuses and penalties and racial skills, and as a woman I appreciate that there's no in-game difference between playing female or male.  Roguelikes aren't the games to do gender political commentary, lol.\n\nSo, if you get ToME (and you absolutely should), you're basically getting what games like the Elder Scrolls series aspire in their most ambitious moments to be: a long-term playfield where you can go on adventures and explore dungeons and become strong from nothing.  Most modern crpgs try to achieve what roguelikes, and *Bands in particular, already had nailed a long time ago, and if you play this version of ToME, you're getting the best of any game I've seen so far in this already-amazing and venerable genre.\n\nOne last thing: this game includes a chat feature that lets you talk to other players as you play on a few different channels, and I highly recommend you use it and get to know some of the other people who know a lot about the game.  Your mileage may vary of course, but in my experience the community for this game is both dedicated and very welcoming and helpful.  The chat is a fantastic feature.","April 27, 2015","true","111.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They're swimming in options and strategies and are playable in either small chunks or long sittings, their random nature makes them highly replayable, and they're just generally nifty keen.\n\nThat said, they also tend to be cruelly unforgiving and really frustrating in the early levels, combined with obtuse interfaces and extremely unhelpful in-game information.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal takes the good and throws away the bad. It has more starting options than any roguelike I've ever seen, and has a fleshed-out world for you to explore. The interface, while not flawless, gives you all the information you need to make good choices and the early levels get you used to adventuring without killing you because you tried to mount your horse from the east instead of the west, or whatever.\n\nI highly, highly, highly recommend this title to anyone who likes any other titles in the genre, or anyone who is at all curious about them.","December 30, 2013","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then look no further. I've never played a game where you can erase the existence of an enemy through temporal powers, become a dragon wielding a massive two handed sword with various dragon-breathes, murder people in their sleep (literally), and even create a small undead army at your disposal.\n\nThis game has been carefully crafted in various ways, for one the grind that's in some games is gone in this game, where shops restock only by your progress into the main campain and you later get a item that seperates what you find from your invintory until you decide to put it in your invintory, then, there's the fact that enemies you face have various tactics. For example, a corruptor can conjure bone sheild that negates all damage for 3 attacks! So if you never invested in a way to deal multiple hits with one attack, you'll have a more difficult time! Then the UI and interface is fully costimizable, you can even auto cast spells, such as buffs and take them off your UI!\n\nThere are various items that have unique prefix-suffixs stats and effects attached to them, much like diablo or torchlight for example. Many powerful items are guarentied to drop from a boss, (aka a yellow artifact item) and if the item doesn't suite your need, you can store it away for the next character you make to use! If you don't even want to use that item, then you can convert into not just gold, but into energy for a special building you acuire. The progession of this game is really solid and at times depend on your race, as some races level up more slowly, but are inately stonger then others. There are plenty of random events and quests that you can undertake, yet they aren't completely random to the point of unfairness.\n\nThe skills and abilities you can accuire are amazing and unique! You can create a gravity mage, or a invincible sword and board user that utilizes deadly counterattacks, or even a summoner where you can sacrifice creatures for various effects or contorl creatures to make one powerful creature! Then you have player races with unique abilities as well, for example a dwarf can eventually phase through walls, and a ghoul that can basically throw up on the ground that damages enemies and heals you! Last you have prodigies that are power and unique feats you acuire later on in the game, for example you can have a effect where an attack will kill you, but you'll save yourself from death, while slowly losing life to the point where if you don't heal you'll actually die!\n\nThe main story is quite interesting and there's a ton of lore that you'll find and is quite deep. Some of this lore can help you find secrets through-out the world and clear up some of the strangest things you'll encounter... There are various difficulties available, so you can have a more casual experience by not losing your hero after he dies, or a more hardcore one where you have one life to live with stronger enemies! There are also various other adventures you can have, without downloading anything extra, for example you can enter into a arena if you just want some good old action, or if you want to have the old experience where it's just you and a dungeon, then you can enter into the infinite dungeon and never look back!\n\nIn fact, I never looked back after playing this game, and never regreted it. There are plenty of games that are not worth your money or time, and this not one of them due to the quality of the mechanics and diversity of character crafting.","December 19, 2013","true","446.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One day I had the bright idea to get a roguelike, since I could hotspot my phones data service to download something rather small that would DL quickly. I got a bunch of roguelikes and I like to think it spawned my eternal love for them during those two years.\n\nAnyway, ToME was one of those roguelikes, and I SWEAR TO YOU I played it almost every single day for hours on end. It is an INCREDIBLY fun and addicting experience. As an avid roguelike player the graphics mean virtually nothing to me, being used to ASCII and barely perceptible tile sets. I still praise the games artwork and aesthetic design highly though. It is so simply rendered yet beautiful in its approach. The gameplay is amazing, turn based, plenty of abilites, plenty of choices, plenty of different ways to build different characters, plenty of differenct races, plenty of different classes. Plenty of everything.\n\nI just recently bought it on steam, along with the dlc, and god DAMN let me ♥♥♥♥ing tell you, the DLC is ♥♥♥♥ING FANTASTIC. In a game that already set a high bar on its self, the DLC pushes that bar and in some places even cracks it open. DarkGod has truly made an amazing game that, with time, I imagine most if not all people can get into, given its alternating difficulties and approach to the traditional roguelike challenges.\n\nAlso, for a roguelike, it is relatively newbie friendly.

For a game of this magnitude, my limited gametime is a drop in the comparative ocean. However in these 14 hours I have enjoyed countless adventures and hence feel the need to express my feelings towards this game.\n\nTOME is a Roguelike in its purest form; that said, it is the formula of dungeons within dungeons and static set pieces that allow its narrative to shine. This is not a game of simply smashing your way through numbers to obtain numbers to increase your numbers this is seen in many RPGS and hack'n'slashes;  there is a rich layer of lore found in conversations as well as scrolls and other objects that add a level of depth and immersion that many other "have a quick go" Roguelikes lack somewhat. Make no mistake, this game is a labour of love.\n\nDespite the level of depth and complexity, TOME is incredibly easy to pick up and play; most aspects of playing are self explanatory. Items and their inherent effects are explained concisely and character sheets are detailed but not cluttered to the point of being rendered unusuable. The inventory is forgiving and even offers to empty itself for you after every floor of a dungeon, eliminating annoying overencumbered messages.\n\nAs stated previously I have amassed 14 hours in this game; in this space of time I have had a measly 1 character exceed level 10. This is a difficult game, an attribute which may put players off but attracts me all the more. Sometimes deaths leave you feeling cheated, especially random encounters in the overworld where an enemy caster can easily 2 or 3 shot an unprepared player from afar; this is countered by the player being transported to another plane upon death by a being of great power. The player then has the choice of being teleported to somewhere safer or dropped back into the fight rejuevenated. I would be lying if I said the latter act of manning up didn't cost me more than one decent character.\n\nWIth the huge amount of races, talent trees, classes etc character creation is a powerful tool and allows you to progress in many different directions. Want a Cursed Elf? Check. Dwarven Alchemist with his own pet Golem? K. Halfling carrying out his own Hellish agenda of slaughter? Got it. Options such as these, the item system and the procedural world give the game practically unending longevity.\n\nIf you can say yes to enjoying Roguelikes, turn based battle, thoughtful strategy, massive replayability and a deep fantasy setting, TOME is a worthy purchase for you.","May 23, 2015","true","46.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My first roguelike was Castle of the Winds back in the mid-90s. I've since played other traditional RLs such as NetHack, as well as "roguelike-inspired" games such as the Diablo series and Path of Exile. ToME4 combines the best of both worlds in a package that is user-friendly, engaging, and extremely entertaining.\n\nThe problem with traditional roguelikes, by modern standards, is the poor user interface and sometimes opaque game mechanics. Their replay potential is very high, but the barrier to entry is equally high. ToME4 keeps the high replay factor while providing excellent GUI. It has full support for both mouse and keyboard controls. Information that would be relegated to wikis for other roguelikes is instead readily available to the player, which gives a very streamlined playing experience. You can jump right into ToME4 and start playing without having to spend hours reading. That's not to say the game is easy, however; I've put well over 100 hours into the game and I'm still nowhere close to finishing the primary campaign.\n\nOn the other side, this game takes some of the best features of action RPGs (e.g., Diablo) while avoiding the pitfalls of that genre. There's a strong element of character progression and customization, through complex gear as well as skills, and many race/class options. However, ToME4 avoids the grinding/farming gameplay that plagues most ARPGs because enemies in ToME4 don't respawn. You progress through the world and clear the various areas, but you can't stay in an easy section and kill endless monsters for loot and experience.\n\nI originally downloaded this game for free from the ToME4 website, but after playing for a few days I bought it on Steam to support the developer (and get some extra unlocks in game!).

Watch your hero grow to be the ultimate awesomeness is a great pleasure for me.\nCombat in this game is the best I've seen in all games, the more skilled you are, the more fun you'll get(in higher difficulties of course). In many games, when you achieve "mastery" everything just becomes a cakewalk. This is never the case in TOME4. You get cocky and you die.\n\nTOME4 is so focus on combat that it DOES NOT have many traditional RPG/roguelike elements such as hunger, tireness, thirst, consumables... You can actually feel that every mechanism in it is born for battle(except some aesthetics options). This is good for TOME4 because adding these will only undermine what TOME4 already have.\n(Unrelated: Non-combat focused roguelikes can be really good as well, have you tried elona? If you ignore the male chauvinism filled in that game, it is magnificent.)\n\nConstantly updatingIt has an ancient history(In the field of computer games) and it is still updating. Major, huge updates including new classes/races/skills/graphics/mechanisms.\n\nOnline features(can be disabled)It offers in-game chat with other players. if you visit the main website you can also check your many characters' details. You can discard them all if you don't want them and that will not affect your gameplay in any way, the only problem is that you won't be able to exchange items stored online between your characters.\n\nFriendly to beginnersIt offers a good tutorial and most of the stuff stay locked until you progress. You won't be overwhelmed by information if you are not prepared.\n\nActive player communityThe forum and wiki are quite useful and TOME4 have tons of mods developed by the players. You can get them easily in the workshops.\n\nDarkgod is SmartThe developer of this game, Darkgod, is extremely smart. The game mechanisms are so well developed that there's no grinding/taking advantage of AI/boredem in late game. Expect a difficult challenge in early game and expect it to be more difficult in late game as well.\n\nDarkgod is KindYou can play this game for free if you download it from the official website.\nIf you pay for the game and DLC you can get many customizable aesthetic options/exchange items between characters/new classes etc. The price is ridiculously cheap as well. Darkgod also accepts additional donations in the game's official website.\n\nWatch how many hours other reviewers and I spent on this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/recommended/259680/","girlkillscomputer","Girl Kills Computer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/girlkillscomputer/","158 products in account","I've been playing roguelikes since the late 80s, early 90s, starting with Nethack when I was a young girl.  Later, I discovered ADOM, and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.  It took me a while to warm up to Angband and its variants, cause I was used to "Hacklikes", which are fundamentally pretty different games.  I'll be using the terminology "*Bands" to refer to the latter, the * meaning put whatever you like there.  Games like Angband, Zangband, Cthangband, Animeband, Hengband, etc.  I'm going to do some comparing, because in order to understand why you should play ToME, some history and context is useful.  You've gotta know what you're getting into, here.\n\nComparing Hacklikes to *Bands is a lot like comparing X-Wing Vs. Tie Fighter to X3.  Roguelikes aren't generally "fast-paced" (with the exception of some wonderful titles like Crypt of the Necrodancer), but when I say that Hacklikes are faster than *Bands, what I mean is the planned length of a successful game is much shorter.  You can beat Nethack in a determined afternoon if you know exactly what you're doing and get a bit lucky.  *Bands are designed to be played for hundreds of hours before completion.  This distinction wasn't apparent to me until I got a bit older and explored the *Bands more thoroughly, because at first I just found them boring and samey.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal (and how do you even say that out loud?) is, historically and in spirit, a *Band game.  It used to be called Tales of Middle Earth, and was based on a game called UMoria, which is in turn an Angband variant.  For ToME 4, they discarded the Tolkein and created all new lore from scratch, and changed a LOT of features.  This is largely the ToME that you'll be playing if you buy this game.\n\nSo, what characterizes a *Band, and ToME in particular?  What kind of games are these?\n\nWhereas in Hacklikes, you are pressed forward by limited resources and infinitely spawning monsters, in a *Band, the game flow is based around infinite resources.  Take food, for example.  In most if not all Hacklikes, your character becomes hungry over time at a pretty good clip, and you have to find food or you will die.  So, much of the early game becomes about knowing which monster corpses are safe or even beneficial to eat, as well as locating non-perishable foods such as rations (which are in turn quite heavy in bulk, necessitating inventory management of very limited space).\n\nIn *Bands, you also get hungry, but the rate at which you do is very very slow compared to Hacklikes.  Monsters generally don't leave corpses, and you can always buy rations in town, which you can always get back to easily with a scroll of recall.  Hacklikes generally have no such spells or scrolls (if they have towns at all), and shop inventory is very limited and, depending on the game, usually does not restock.\n\nHunger is, however, a mechanic that later on becomes almost a non-issue in winning Hacklike runs.  There exist items that can slow digestion or produce infinite or near-infinite food in most all Hacklikes, such that the hunger mechanic mostly kills off early characters or very unlucky midrange characters.  And in *Bands, I'm a relative noob, but I've still never lost a character due to hunger.\n\nSo, why even have a hunger mechanic, then?  The developer of ToME probably asked himself that very question, and did away with hunger for ToME 4.  This is only one of many smoothed out, streamlined mechanics that fully embrace the *Band / infinite resources heritage of ToME and make it more accessible for newcomers.  There are also no unidentified items, for instance, and the game offers you an "adventure" mode where you have more than one life, or an "exploration" mode that's unlocked and visible right from the start, with infinite lives.  Of course, I'm bullheaded and old-school, so I only play on "roguelike" mode, where dead is dead.  But you might find you have wiggle room in other modes to learn more per character.\n\nYou're still going to die a lot, especially if you play anything other than a Bulwark.  But the classes are very interesting, and the lore is very well-written and interesting.  You gradually unlock more birth options (for new characters) as you play and find certain sidequests, but nothing else is persistent between runs, unlike many of the rogue-lites and mystery dungeon type games that have been popular lately.  This is a very hardcore, old-school roguelike of the *Band lineage.  You'll be playing any particular character for a very long time, growing attached to them and overcoming many challenges before dying horribly 100 hours from now because you got stupid for a second.  And then you're going to start over, because it's insanely fun.\n\nAlchemists in particular are probably my favorite class so far: You get a golem that you can equip and that has laser eyes and charges into battle to take hits for you while you throw grenades from the back lines.  I like to name mine after my boyfriend.  Summoners are also a lot of fun: you can throw wolves at peoples' faces, and summon dragons and minotaurs to kill things while your turtle tanks for you.  But I really recommend playing Bulwark or maybe Berserker to start: they're much less flimsy (Bulwarks in particular, they're the sword/mace/axe and board characters) and will let you learn more and accomplish more birth unlocks per run.\n\nHealing is accomplished through cooldown abilities rather than limited items, and you have a lot of options for talent specs to build even a particular class in very different ways.  Different races have very useful and interesting bonuses and penalties and racial skills, and as a woman I appreciate that there's no in-game difference between playing female or male.  Roguelikes aren't the games to do gender political commentary, lol.\n\nSo, if you get ToME (and you absolutely should), you're basically getting what games like the Elder Scrolls series aspire in their most ambitious moments to be: a long-term playfield where you can go on adventures and explore dungeons and become strong from nothing.  Most modern crpgs try to achieve what roguelikes, and *Bands in particular, already had nailed a long time ago, and if you play this version of ToME, you're getting the best of any game I've seen so far in this already-amazing and venerable genre.\n\nOne last thing: this game includes a chat feature that lets you talk to other players as you play on a few different channels, and I highly recommend you use it and get to know some of the other people who know a lot about the game.  Your mileage may vary of course, but in my experience the community for this game is both dedicated and very welcoming and helpful.  The chat is a fantastic feature.","April 27, 2015","true","111.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No, this isn't a great looking game. If you're looking for smooth animation, amazing visuals, flashy effects, etc., you won't find them here. The music isn't great (I play with it muted and one of the many video game and movie soundtracks I have on itunes playing in the background), and sometimes the ambience is a little annoying (whoever owns the dog that barks nonstop in every city needs to put a muzzle on it or something). Now, for the good things. The gameplay is hard as nails, unforgiving, confusing at times, and all around frustratingly hard, as any good roguelike should be. You have to option to play with more lives, even infinite lives, but I always play on the "roguelike" mode, where you only have one life, unless you find more. Knowing what is happening around you at all times is a must in this game, as losing focus of even one enemy can mean death, as I learned the hard way in my most recent death (opened a door, orc necromancer on the other side, managed to escape at first, but on my way back to see if I could get around him, was flanked by his summoned army of skeletons and ghouls). This is a true roguelike, with everything happening in turns as you wander through forests and dungeons, killing everything in your path, picking up loot, buying weapons and armour, and, when you make a mistake, dying with no continues or reloads (at least on roguelike mode).

One day I had the bright idea to get a roguelike, since I could hotspot my phones data service to download something rather small that would DL quickly. I got a bunch of roguelikes and I like to think it spawned my eternal love for them during those two years.\n\nAnyway, ToME was one of those roguelikes, and I SWEAR TO YOU I played it almost every single day for hours on end. It is an INCREDIBLY fun and addicting experience. As an avid roguelike player the graphics mean virtually nothing to me, being used to ASCII and barely perceptible tile sets. I still praise the games artwork and aesthetic design highly though. It is so simply rendered yet beautiful in its approach. The gameplay is amazing, turn based, plenty of abilites, plenty of choices, plenty of different ways to build different characters, plenty of differenct races, plenty of different classes. Plenty of everything.\n\nI just recently bought it on steam, along with the dlc, and god DAMN let me ♥♥♥♥ing tell you, the DLC is ♥♥♥♥ING FANTASTIC. In a game that already set a high bar on its self, the DLC pushes that bar and in some places even cracks it open. DarkGod has truly made an amazing game that, with time, I imagine most if not all people can get into, given its alternating difficulties and approach to the traditional roguelike challenges.\n\nAlso, for a roguelike, it is relatively newbie friendly. Easy to play and hard to master ya dig?\n\n","June 22, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My lack of achievements likely stems from the fact I started out by playing 3 games on "roguelike" setting (permadeath). This approach is not something I would reccommend for new players because it's absolutely brutal. This aside, I got this at a crazy discount and was so impressed that I was happy to pay five times as much for the expansions as I paid for the game itself. This speaks volumes and ToME really is a class act. There are so many positives to this game that it is difficult to pick out the MAIN things that set it firmly above the crowd but, for me personally, it has to be the fact that it actually works as a lore filled RPG without ever feeling repetitive or grindy and without the nonsensical quests of other PG games. It's literally the ONLY time I've ever seen a roguelike actually work like a proper RPG.","February 24","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't let the graphics fool you, the gameplay is incredibly deep with a large amount of races, classes, enemies, quests, skills, items and free choice. ToME is all about gameplay and less about graphics, kind of like Dwarf Fortress. Even the dialogue and lore (there is a lot to read if you so desire) is well-written and the world is interesting to explore and uncover its mysteries.\n\nThere are a lot of stats but they are all straightforward and easy to find. You will rarely be confused about what a certain stat does, and you don't even need to know about everything. You can dive in straight for some proper min-maxing or just play and learn as you go. I recommend to start with an easier, straightforward class like the Bulwark. Then later you can try out the more difficult to master classes with interesting names like the Oozemancer, Stone Warden or Paradox Mage. There is enormous build variety. You can unlock the more specialist classes, skill trees and even races just by playing the game. By spending some extra points you can even use skill trees that are not available to your class from the start.\n\nBattles are very engaging and for the more difficult fights you will have to think about your next turn. With plenty of skills and items available you can really think about your strategy. Or maybe you don't want to fight at all, there is no shame in running to come back later and finish that boss when you're stronger. The game appears to be very well balanced, which is a great achievement if you consider the enormous build variety.\n\nThe game is large, there are a lot of places to explore, the only problem i have with the world is that every new character has to pass through the same locations which can get a little boring if you die a lot (which you will). Luckily all maps are randomly generated and there are several game modes (infinite lives, multiple lives, 1 live), so you don't have to go all hardcore.\n\nToME was made for pure fun. You don't like mindlessly exploring empty maps for a single piece of loot or to find the exit? Just press the auto-explore button and skip all that nonsense. Your character will automatically explore and pick up everything until it sees an enemy. There is very little grinding just to get XP, almost everything you do is part of a quest or will lead to one. Are you overleveled? The game will ask you if you want to skip the whole area! If you manage to get far enough in to the game you will get your own flying fortress with a small shared stash that you can expand by donating more. There's also the (in-game!) Steam Workshop that contains a great many mods to make your life in ToME even more enjoyable. And an in-game chat with plenty of helpful and experienced players.\n\nDo you like Steam Achievements? This game has 1395 of them!\n\nTotally recommended to any true fans of rogue-likes and skill-based RPG's. Pay for the game or donate to support the developers or get the game for free on their website!","January 6","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

More beginner friendly among the major roguelikes, in my opinion. And it's addictive.

But, I don't want a huge challenge. I just want to bash monsters, get my gold and magic items, gain levels and explore a new world. So, I start my first character. A dwarf, sword and board warrior type. (There are a lot of race and class combinations) What I didn't like was the fact that after cutting my way through the first dungeon, I went out into the world and wandered into what must have been a higher level dungeon. The first monster I saw was level twenty and it beat the crap out of me and killed me so fast that I didn't have a chance to run away. Then, I go to sort of a Purgatory-like place, where this dude asks if I want to live or stay dead. I chose to live, so I respawn in the dungeon and get killed again. Okay, bad idea. So I go back to Purgatory and then I tell the dude, yeah I want to live but send me some place else. So, he does. Then, I run into an adventuring party which kills me for the third time. The character is done. No more respawns. No more exploring, just finished. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. If I want hardcore, I should have the option for it. It shouldn't be mandatory.\nEdit-Now, after having played the game quite a bit, I find it a lot of fun. I play in "explorer mode," which allows infinite lives.

I did it solely because a friend who had never played it before recommended it to me, and it was entirely worth it. For 7 bucks, how can you go wrong?\n\nI started off knowing NOTHING. I did the tutorial, which shows you the absolute basics, like movement, but everything else was a mystery. The first few games I played, I tried going archer. It was fun, but my ignorance was appearant. After maybe an hour of playing it, I dropped it completely. I didn't touch it for almost a year.\n\nRecently, I decided to play it again, out of boredom more than anything. It started off a tad rough, but within a few hours, I made a lot of progress. With a few more, I really felt confident playing it.\n\nI'm definitely not claiming to be a master at this game. I am nowhere near close. I have only ever "finished" one game, and that was with infinite lives. However, the point I'm trying to make is that this game looks hard to master, but if you just tinker with it for a few hours, you will get over that learning curse seriously fast. That intimidating looking level-up screen becomes your female dog, and you know exactly what you need to do.\n\nThis game as incredible depth and replayability. It was made almost completely by a SINGLE person, and on top of which, it is 7USD. Don't worry too much about the DLC, either. In no way will your gameplay be hampered by not getting them. They do, however, offer incredible new storylines and playable classes, so I would get them if you can afford it.\n\nThis is, hands down, one of, if not the best, RPGs available.

I did it solely because a friend who had never played it before recommended it to me, and it was entirely worth it. For 7 bucks, how can you go wrong?\n\nI started off knowing NOTHING. I did the tutorial, which shows you the absolute basics, like movement, but everything else was a mystery. The first few games I played, I tried going archer. It was fun, but my ignorance was appearant. After maybe an hour of playing it, I dropped it completely. I didn't touch it for almost a year.\n\nRecently, I decided to play it again, out of boredom more than anything. It started off a tad rough, but within a few hours, I made a lot of progress. With a few more, I really felt confident playing it.\n\nI'm definitely not claiming to be a master at this game. I am nowhere near close. I have only ever "finished" one game, and that was with infinite lives. However, the point I'm trying to make is that this game looks hard to master, but if you just tinker with it for a few hours, you will get over that learning curse seriously fast. That intimidating looking level-up screen becomes your female dog, and you know exactly what you need to do.\n\nThis game as incredible depth and replayability. It was made almost completely by a SINGLE person, and on top of which, it is 7USD. Don't worry too much about the DLC, either. In no way will your gameplay be hampered by not getting them. They do, however, offer incredible new storylines and playable classes, so I would get them if you can afford it.\n\nThis is, hands down, one of, if not the best, RPGs available.

Isn't it ugly and repulsive?\nWell, this game is a prime example of looks not having to tell anything about the value of a game.\nTales of Maj'Eyal (ToME) is a turn based RPG with many roguelike features. Overall, the story isn't relevant (although there is a lot of lore to read). It rather concentrates on fighting, looting, and leveling.\nInstead of writing an in-depth review here are the apects that I like the most about it:\n\nClasses\nToME has a whole lot of classes to offer. Sure, there are the archetypes like Warrior or Archer. However, you will also find many crazy and interesting classes. Examples for this are the Paradox Mage who controls time, the Oozemancer who draws his powers from oozes and slime, and the Wyrmic who uses the powers of the dragons.\n\nNo One-Trick Ponies\nMost skills (called "Talents") in the game have cooldowns. IMO this is great because it makes concentrating on one or a couple of talents an irrelevant strategy. Just the amount of talents in the game is staggering. In addition, many talents of a class allow for synergies. Also, you have to be well prepared for a number of different situations.\nThe cooldowns make combat so much more interesting. It is always a good idea to carefully consider using which talent in which situation. Just nuked a standard enemy with your most powerful spell? Well, you won't have it available for the next 20 turns.\n\nSpecial Enemies\nSome enemies can have the talents of one (or even multiple!) of the classes available to the player. This will put you repeatedly in extremely dangerous but also very interesting situations.\n\nLoot\nThe game offers tons of randomly generated loot. The items can vary in their stats heavily and may change your playstyle a lot. There are also items with predefined properties (called artifacts).\nHovering over an item shows a very detailed description (same with talents).\n\nI highly recommend ToME.\nBtw, you can even legally get the game for free. Buying it on Steam will unlock a number of donator bonuses which are honestly dispensable. Did I regret my purchase, though? Not at all! The game is well worth the asking price and I am happy that I could support the dev a bit.","July 16, 2015","true","434.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first tag is "Rogue-like", the second is "RPG". This is not a traditional "learn as you go on a mighty quest" kind of RPG game, it is a rougue-like. You will learn as you die. You have one life (or multiple on Adventure mode) and will thus have to be tactical and smart with the decisions you make.\n\nNow, getting with the review, this is a fantastic game that i highly recommend you try if you are a ROGUE-LIKE fan, not a traditional RPG fan. The game doesn't bring miscellaneous lose conditions to discourage and hinder you like other games in the genre. This is not to say that the game is a cakewalk, rather it is far from it. The game expects you to die and to learn from it, take the time to analyze why you took 30% of your health in one shot, check the game log, inspect enemy monsters before you rush in so you can take them on effectively.\n\nThe game has excellent replayability, due to the diversity of races and classes as well as random dungeons and alternate layouts. Different races and classes also start in different areas and have slightly differing dungeons available, allowing for even more content that you may have not known was there in the first place. This, along with random loot that can have a wide variety of effects leads to the player enjoying exploring the world and tackling rare monsters.\n\nEven more content can be unlocked with the Arena and Infinite modes that can be obtained once you get to a certain point in the Campaign (both are fairly early). Arena mode lets you pick a race and class and lets you test your skill against a 30 or 60 wave gauntlet. Infinite places you in an infinite dungeon where you explore and try to survive for as long as you can.\n\nOverall, this game is a fun challenge for anyone who has the patience to see when to run and when to fight as well as the ability to say "I just spent 10 hours on a character and he/she died. That's fine, let's see where we went wrong and try again." And for those who read the negative reviews and saw "i ran into a wall of lvl 20 guys at lvl 1, game is unbalaced", they ran into a event (which you can avoid and come back to later) where you open a locked door and fight high leveled enemies for better loot. It's a high risk high reward area, and if you don't think you can do it, don't.\n\nTLDR: If you have the patience to realise you made a mistake and analyze it, and you enjoy rougue-likes, this is a good game. You will die, a lot. This is part of the game. It is wonderful and has replayability like no other. Also, don't open sealed doors unless you are ready to fight high level guys who will kill you if you don't know what you're doing.","October 30, 2015","true","124.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The ability to unlock things as you explore the world makes the game feel more rewarding on death than some of the older games in the genre, but even when you first start playing there's enough going on to keep you occupied.\n\nThere are also some convenient QOL features like autoexplore and everything being on cooldowns instead of consumables means you can focus on combat rather than carefully hoarding mana/stamina/equilibrium/health pots.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual roguelite with a quick iteration time, look elsewhere.\n\n9/10","December 5, 2015","true","110.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It might take an hour or so of playing to really understand what's going on and how the game works, but once you figure it out the game really opens up.\n\nPros:\n- Many races and classes to choose from, allows for quite a few styles of play\n- Combat greatly rewards the use of tactics\n- Turn-based, so you can take as long as you need to to strategize\n\nCons:\n- Campaign mode is quite long, can easily play a character for 6 hours then have them die, which is heart-breaking\n- Loot doesn't seem to matter much for magic-based characters. Also not much incentive to buy anything as a mage either.\n- Although dungeons have random layouts, the campaign mode is pretty much the same every time. This can make the beginning of the game tedious once you've done it several times and it doesn't really change\n\nNeutral:\n- Graphics. I personally like the graphics in the game, but some might find them dated\n\nAll in all I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys difficult, turn-based rpg's. If for some reason you hate grinding or repetition, you ay have problems with this game.\n","May 5","true","19.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Its looks old but has a lot of modern elements added on. If you like tatical turn base cRPGs and don't mind tilesets then this is seriously a great game. SO MUCH CUSTOMIZATION! So many choices and so many ways you will die... but fear not as there are a few game modes ranging from infinite lives to true roguelike. Easy to play but its got a really robust mechanic system. Also has modding support. Tons of gear, tons of weapons, tons of monsters, tons of areas, tons of lore, and a stupidly high number of race/classes (of which u get to choose how they level and play via skills and perks and the RNG gear)\n\nOh ya and no grinding. Once u clear a floor or whole dungeon its cleared for good. I think new hostiles can spawn on the overworld map though like hostile patrols, though not 100% sure.\n\nI should mention the game is 100% free (aside from the DLC) at te4.org though its made and maintsianed by 1 dude so worth it to buy it if you like it. And u can connect online to play but you won't see anyone as you are more or less just uploading your data and sometimes u might be playing and recieve a special world event because u were lucky to be logged in when it started :)\n\n4/5 is my personal rating for the game. Its great verging on fantatsic! And I would recomend this to more mature older gamers like myself.

Either from completing quests, slaying unique entities, finding documents, or reading wall and statue inscriptions one can discover all a manner of things about the world, its inhabitants, cultures, races, monsters, relics, and more!\nFinally, all the unique particle effects for the spells, and all the new unique effects on the HUD, add a bit of insight to a world you would otherwise rely solely on text and figurines to understand what is going on. Things turn darker when you are influenced by an effect that decreases sight range, things blur if your stunned, dazed, and such, the screen tinges a different color based on whether you are bleeding, frozen solid, standing in fire, poison muck, or acid... this is highly useful since you'll need to resolve effects, some of which you might not realize your under the effect of without of this.\nAlso, the game is so VERY detailed that they have different difficulties for both realism and complexity. Want unlimited lives? Explorer style is best for you. Want a limited set of chances based upon your successes and failures? Try the standard experience. Care to put your life in the hands of fate? Choose Roguelike, for a single life, with the potential for another if you discover things like becoming a Lich or Reincarnating in that specific life!\nThis is well well built.

This means that the game offers huge amount of content, almost cluttered UI but for a patient gamer opens up as a solid option for those that want to experience the deep roguelike setting with some improvements.\n\nFirst of all, Tales of Maj'Eyal is a free-to-play game, by buying it you will receive some improvements/add-ons to it but the core gameplay remains same. As a Steam fanboy and a roguelike fan it was enough for me that the game was on Steam but I'm not 100% sure if it's enough for those counting their last dollars since you can enjoy this game legally without paying, though it's always nice to help the developers ;)\n\nIn Tales of Maj'Eyal you pick a race (Human, Elf etc.) and a class (warrior, wizard) with some unique options not seen elsewhere. You begin your quest in pre-determined area (dungeon) and after moving through it you get to the world map and are free to go wherever you desire (although you will get killed in most of the places you *can* go). There are several difficulty options to choose from between few extra lives and permadeath.\n\nYou can also unlock new races, classes and quests by achieving different things in-game (no spoilers here) but it will take some time to get to that point since the game is rock hard. By the time I'm writing this I've played something like 6,5 hours and haven't scratched the surface yet so there's definitely a huge amount of content and replayability here.\n\nIf you have ever played/enjoyed ADOM this is a game for you.\nIf you want to see what those old roguelikes would be today this is game for you.\nIf you hate dying this *might* be a game for you.\n\nPros\n-Graphics\n-Hardcore difficulty\n-The amount of content\n-You can use mouse and/or keyboard\n\nCons\n-Graphics (some people concider tilesets ugly)\n-Difficulty (it really is)\n-The amount of things you will have to read and learn (Steam guides help with this one)\n-You can get it for free\n\nOverral\nPretty much the only solution for "true" roguelike with graphics 8/10","December 30, 2013","true","63.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Every detail has explanations that explain the effects; for example, leveling up primary stats (eg, vitality, strength, etc) will show the effects on secondary stats (eg, crit chance, health, etc).\n\nPlayers are encouraged to play in order to unlock additional races, classes, game types, etc. In my first run, I stumbled across a zoo -- and died shortly after. However, I unlocked the summoner class because I had come across a zoo.\n\nIn another play through, I finished the first quest and headed to the town. In town, I agreed to fight 3 elite warriors in order to prove myself worthy of the arena. I was afraid that I would die again -- after all, I was doing so well in this run. It paid off because winning unlocked the Arena game mode.\n\nI would add that he vast number of achievements also helps replayability, except that there are over 1300 achievements. This will be pretty frustrating for anyone looking for 100% achievement completion.\n\nThe only part of the game that is lacking is the graphics; though that comes with the territory in a roguelike. Despite every item, monster, spell icon, and basically the entire game fitting into a square-sized sprite, there is still a lot of variety: Player icons seem to change based on equipment and active spells.","September 22, 2014","true","350.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You get custom tiles that look cool but really nothing more then just a cosmetic thing. Exploration mode which just gives you infinate lives while nice! it sorta (in my opinion) takes away what makes a roguelike fun and thats perma death. The items vault that lets you share a small amount of items between character, i wont lie is nice but again isnt game breaking what so ever You also get ONE class a stone warden defensive class that only dwarves can use, while pretty nice is just but one class compared to the 26 classes you can already unlock and use in the free versin.  Now about the game itself! This game has a beautiful UI with custom nice looking icons for every thing, a DETAILED and easy to understand leveling system with talent points you can spend on a mix of features unique to EVERY(26) CLASS, a more common tree avalible to other classes, and stat points which you gain every level and distribute as you see fit. There is also a large amount of magical equipment drops with a balenced but wide variety of stats and effects to keep things interesting with your lewt! The best thing i love about ToME is that unlike most other roguelikes there is a variety of places to explore from dungeons to sand caves or  crystal caverns and theives dens! There are many other locations spread throughout the game world for you to find and explore. Some of the places you explore may unlock additional classes/races! did i mention the unlocks? yeah theres a lot and there nice. So i hope you read and this and found something you like from my review and decide to give this wonderful game a try.","December 13, 2013","true","10.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freeconscience/recommended/259680/","freeconscience","bleh ~ Mr. China","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freeconscience/","215 products in account","I am a die hard fan of the original ADOM (Ancient Domains of Mystery),  the ORIGINAL roguelike as well as a player of another lesser known ASCII roguelike game as well as several others. Tales of Maj'Eyal or TOME is clone of ADOM. The keybinding are the same, classes are the same and fans of the original will find many more similarities. If I didn't enjoying play or rather enjoying dying in the original game, I probably would enjoy this game more.\n\nMy general thoughts about the game (trying to keep it balanced)\nI enjoyed the different classes. Making decisions to improve my character. You always feel like you are improving. However your characters skills may improve, overall the game felt incredibly stale and boring. Who cares about the items? the weapons? the books? This is what I turn my attention to next: looting system and gameplay.\n\nIn TOME, I pick up a few weapons to kill a few more enemies more quickly as I mindlessly and easily kill them. I really didn't get any satisfaction from looting.  This is because TOME is just sooo much easier than the original as well as TOME doesn't give you the chance to just pick up a weapon and try it. In ADOM, you can dig at the walls, getting some rocks (if your axepick doesn't break) where you can use to throw at the invading enemies. This is totally eliminated in TOME. You need a talent to even use a bow or sling? Come on! This meant for my playthrough I just had many millions of mindless, predictably leveled and simple enemies to grind my way through. Great for fans of WOW who love the grind and level up your character, but boring for everyone else. In ADOM, you are just one slime mold, hard armoured enemy, or river from losing your cherished weapon. In TOME, who cares? Your weapon will never get damaged. In ADOM, if you pick up a special wand of teleportation with 2 charges, it could easy save your life in a tough pinch. Without that special item, you could easily die. If you carefully zap that wand when you have no other escape, it could save your life if your luck is with you. If luck is against you, you could still die and unlike TOME with almost infinite resaves (roguelike my ♥♥♥!) there is no teleporting back in the game once you died. If you used that wand too early, you might not have it later when you REALLY need it. Even a decision like using a wand was just sooo much more important in ADOM. In TOME, who cares? You quickly get the tp spell on a 9 turn cooldown. In comparison, many games I didn't even run into the wand even once. So when you got the loot in ADOM, it really meant something. In TOME, looting was just a tedious chore.\n\nLet me explain more about the difference between TOME (the clone) and the original by way of a story. In ADOM, I remember being excited about finding every single item. Often high powered stuff would drop that was far above your level. If you got that loot, you were pretty much golden (until it rusted, broke, was stolen by a thief, obliterated by spells, or burned up). Then when your prized weapon invariably was destroyed, you realized that you only had 7 rocks and two loaves of bread before starvation or death. Then after defeating a kobold, you realize that he dropped a book containing powerful magic. You hear something being killed in the level, so you open a door,  lock it and begin to read the book. You feel more hunger and as the hunger continues to get stronger, you finish the book, and learn the magic. You then remember that you carefully dropped some food and some extra weapons on some stairs a few levels above. As you use your new powerful magic to destroy the enemies coming for you, you begin to feel more and more hungry (first see yellow notification for hunger, then an orange notification). As I'm describing this, I slipping a bit into the character of the game. The graphics were non-existent, just letter characters for each enemy but the many choices you could make in the game made you feel like you were in the game. Getting back to the story, as our intrepid hero continues slowly towards the stairs, and the notifications continue to flash more dire, you realize that your hero is not going to make it. You look in your inventory. You notice a seed and a kobold corpse. You quickly eat the seed. You take one more step, staving off death for one more step. You are only a few steps from death. You look in the inventory and now you see a rotting kobold corpse. You realize that you are dead. You eat the kobold corpse, become paralyzed and stunned. After unsuccessfully trying to move, you suddenly die in two turns, still close to the stairs and the weapon and food drop. After heroically surviving the loss of your prized possession, your hero dies from starvation so close to his goal. This is what I loved about ADOM, getting really high level loot, getting attacked by surprising high level enemies, almost dying, surviving before finally dying.\n\nI have lost many many characters in ADOM. It was really interesting trying to discover the code for the game. I tried my best, but like Sid Meier's Pirates, the game was next to impossible to finish. TOME has many elements that I loved about the original. Discovering the Infinite Dungeon, Troll's Cave, Gladiator Tournament all felt cool to me once again. I still really enjoy the premise behind TOME. I think I'll probably eventually end up playing more of this game. Maybe if I can create some overpowered raccoons/companions to follow me around, I'll feel like less of a letdown. I had a lot of happy memories playing ADOM. Throwing massive stones throw doorways to break the doors down into very much needed wood that I could use to make arrows was a lot of fun. Even creating loyal zombies to follow me around as a necromancer was a lot of fun. Fighting powerful enemies that could stun you, blind you, or do many dastardly things to you was a lot of fun. If I can dramatically ramp up the difficulty, TOME might do it for me.\n\nI only don't recommend it because as a die hard fan, I feel they could have done so much more.\n\n","May 3","false","16.9"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","22","5","23","3","7"

My 6 hours was spent handily defeating everything in an area until things got too hard, then backing out to another stage and doing the same.  I got the feeling I could do that for 60 hours, then win the game.\n\nIf you like lore and you like loot, this game has tons.  But for me, the gameplay just didn't sell it.\n\n(A commenter points out it's not technically grinding since cleared areas remain cleared.

I was a fan of the old ADOM game and this is a port of a similar game, but the problem is that it suffers from number-crunch-itus, old UI and selection tools, and general design philosphies that hold over from the days when coding desicion-making logic took precidence above usability. The port did not fix these issue. I find myself resenting this game, as it seems to punish the user for variables that are outside of the user's control. This punishment hangs over your shoulder in every dungeon around every corner your turn, like an abusive friendship that you hope you can improve with time, but never have the tools to adress.","January 18","false","237.9"," 14 of 52 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","14","52","0","0"

I've been playing this game since before it was on steam and had hoped that they would have fixed a lot of things, but they haven't.  Now I find myself hating having put it on my steam collection.\n\nMy experience with this game has been singular.  I waste time creating a character and spawn in a room full of monsters, half of which are level 2 while I am level one.  9 times out of 10, it has spawned me right next to these creatures, so within a round or two of starting the game, my character is dead and in a situation that they CANNOT get out of.  Kill the character off, make a new one, continue this cycle ad nauseum.\n\nThe tutorial tells you outright that the character is OP for the tutorial and your character in the game will be 'weaker,' but what they fail to tell you is the monsters in the tutorial are weaker than you'll be facing in the actual game as well.  Inventory management is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and the random dungeon generation frequently makes walls with 'holes' in them (diagonally placed) so trying to take a corner to limit avenues of attack tends to result in getting attacked through the wall by something on the other side you didn't even know was there.\n\nThe game is interesting.  It should be fun as it is presented.  It is not.","April 11, 2014","false","3.4"," 61 of 197 people (31%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","31","61","197","5","7"

While it is true that this game does have a great community and great class variety, I stumbled upon a gamebreaking bug. Halfway through the game is an important dungeon with a boss you have to defeat before you are allowed to go through the second half of the game. I was able to clear all levels and on the final level I was not able to find the boss. I had searched the entire level. I inquired in the chat and the community was helpful on this, they gave me solutions like spamming skills that would illuminate the whole area and reveal invisible creatures, digging out areas of the level and eventually I had dug out the entire level. When that didn't work they told me to make a post on the forums and/or contact the game developer. They claimed it would only take a day for the developer to respond however I waited over a week and I had given my savefile to the developer and got no response. Meanwhile in my thread I was told to reset the dungeon. I did this and was forced  to do it again, making the dungeon harder because you would of gained a couple levels doing the previous version of the dungeon and then when you reset it, it rescales to your current level. Bottom line is, do not buy this game unless you want to find gamebreaking bugs and get no solution.","February 23, 2014","false","52.0"," 11 of 111 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","11","111","2","0"

To that I say, if you must use the No True Scotsman fallacy to defend your game from critique, you've already failed.\n\nEscape options in this game are largely restricted to teleports; due to the level disparity that prompts a need for an escape, nothing less then escape in a single turn is fast enough. Unfortunately, the teleports are random and unreliable until late game, when they are finally targetable.\n\nIf you like a game where drinking a potion could kill you and there is no way to detect it is posion, you may find this game palatable.\nIf you like a game where just the act of entering a dungeon or changing a level may cause your character to slip and break their neck (die), you may find this game palatable.\n\nConversely, if you believe that no matter how hard a game is, the game should provide you the tools to handle risks like these and only punish you for not using those tools, then you will probably find this game to be 'fake hard'.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathshinobi/recommended/259680/","deathshinobi","DS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathshinobi/","110 products in account","Tales of Maj'Eyal is a very rewarding Roguelike game.  Before you buy the game, though, you should consider whether the Roguelike genre appeals to you because this game is not a typical dungeon crawling RPG like Diablo II.  It seems that most of the negative reviews for this game have come from players who failed to consider their purchase.\n\nThe basic premise of a Roguelike game is randomly or semi-randomly generated dungeons with randomly generated monsters and randomly generated loot.  Luck is an integral part of the Roguelike genre, and most of them allow you only one life.  Skilled players can work with what they're given to create a powerful character, and get through very challenging randomly generated rooms/bosses/dungeons/etc.  Less skilled players might find that they die.  Often.  Tales of Maj'Eyal is unusually 'fair' for a Roguelike game, but you shouldn't mistake that to mean that it's easy, because it isn't easy at all.  It gives you extra lives, and most of the time the monsters are beatable for your level (even if they say that they're a much higher level).  The game even warns you when you're about to open a special room (rooms that often times have very numerous and/or difficult and/or high level monsters) or treasure chest (which usually spawns enemies).  Occasionally you'll run into a very difficult pack of mobs or a difficult boss, and if you lose all of your lives, then you die.  That's life, and that's how the Roguelike genre works.  Hopefully you unlocked something to explore for your next playthrough.\n\nThe appeal of this game is that there is a LOT of stuff to unlock.  You'll find yourself accidentally unlocking new classes, races, and even game modes all the time, unless you're using an unlockables guide, in which case you probably aren't having as much fun as you could be having!  There's also a great amount of class diversity, tons of classes, and even lots of depth within each class.  As a bonus, the game features a really cool world to explore and learn about.  There isn't so much of a 'storyline' but there is really a lot of lore to learn, and there are many things to discover about the current shape of the world, past events, and even letters and such from random adventurers or random people that give insight on a particular dungeon or event.  If you're anything like me, then you'll love that part of the game, but if you're one of those people who never read anything in a game, ever, then that's fine too because you can easily skip lore popups and keep playing.  If these things sound appealing to you, then great, you'll love the game.  If the Roguelike premise doesn't sound very appealing, then you may want to look elsewhere, but don't buy the game and then make a negative review if you can't even get past the first level (also here's a tip: don't play a Shalore on your first playthrough because they have a very difficult starting zone... I suspect that people who found the first level to be 'impossible' probably played a Shalore).\n\nThe UI definitely has its shortcomings, which is probably the worst thing about the game, but all-in-all I think it's a very impressive game for having been designed by one person, and well worth your 7 dollars to buy.  Also you can play it for free at te4.org, so if you're on the fence about whether to purchase it, feel free to play for, well, free.","April 23, 2014","true","232.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't want the "starting" excitement to overwhelm me.\nAfter having played this game with several characters, I can say that every playthrough, I get more and more excited about this game. For me, this game is difficult and hardcore, I am not that experienced with rpg's but this game makes me want to be and every playthrough, I feel like I have learned new things.\nFor the first time, I carefully think about choices I make, what should I level up, how should I handle this enemy. For the first time, I take my time for every turn (usually with this kind of games, I rush through my turns as if it was real-time). The game makes me want to use my skills and intelligence and for me, this is a first-timer.\n\nThe funny thing is, I had this game marked as "Not Interested" originally, but came here by reading a review under another -not so good- game. That other game had much better graphics, but I don't care about graphics. On the other hand, because I had mostly been dissapointed by roguelikes with low-quality graphics (although TOME actually has relative good graphics for its genre) I had never looked at this game in detail. It was after that other review and seeing that people have actually spent a whole year in playtime on this game that I got interested.\n\nThat's sad... because this game is REALLY worth it. And it certainly is worth the price. I bought it at -30% and now I feel like they could easily charge 3x the price (and even more) and it would still be worth it. This game needs a commercial boost :-)\n\nI am really enjoying this game, dying all the time and stuff like that. I prefer adventure-mode because I can die several times before it is game over, but I still don't want to die (like you could play through in exploration mode) so it still makes me try to play it roguelike (which is too hard for me at this time).\n\nI also like how this game builds up unlocks: especially for me, being not that experienced, I like that in the beginning not all character types can be played and must be unlocked. It makes me build up my knowledge about the game and probably only when I am ready to learn about new types of character, they will be unlocked.\n\nI wonder if I will stop buying other games on steam now for the next year because if I look at other people playing this game (2500 hours of playtime), it seems like I will never get bored with this game and will never need another game :-).\n\nI think I can safely say that this game is for all kinds of RPG players: the beginners and the very experienced.\n\nBuy it! Buy it now! :-)\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention: it has a very very very good community. In game, you have chatrooms and when you have a question, you can ask it there and there's almost always someone who answers.","January 17, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's hard, very hard.\n\nOkay, so its a roguelike. But it has options to make it less unforgiving, up to a mode where you can just play en die and respawn untill you have enough. So, the casual player is catered to. Then there's a mode where you have limited lives - you can respawn, but only a few times. And of course the real roguelike - one life. Die, you're out of luck.\n\nIt's huge. I have been playing for hours and hours and so far have only made it to the 'second half' of the game twice. I am estimating that running a single game end-to-end will take you at least 4-6 hours. Though, I moght be a slowpoke - perhaps better, more experienced players can do it in a few hours less.\n\nIt's got possibilities. Like, there are so many ways to develop a character. So far I have been fiddling around with one class to see what get's me farther and farther into the game and that is working. You play, you die. Think, why did I die? Adapt in the next character.\n\nIt has a very smart way of lulling you into a false sense of security by allowing you to kill most critters on your path, then hit you from behind with some nasty rare radom boss.\n\nThere is mods out the various orifices too - enou8gh to adapt is to a format you like better.\n\nOh, I'd also like to add that there is a massive fanbase on the formums where the (I do believe it's one guy?) developer DarkGod hangs out too - and he actually posts, listens and helps out when you are in trouble.\n\nTrust me - if you are into roguelikes or like fiddling around for aeons with character builds, this is something you want.\nIf you are not the masochistic type, it has ways of lettign you in gently and be much more forgiving.","January 2, 2015","true","183.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And over all the story and lore are rich and rewarding...Honestly a 10/10 game that I recommend to all RPG lovers.","December 3, 2014","true","371.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's hard, very hard.\n\nOkay, so its a roguelike. But it has options to make it less unforgiving, up to a mode where you can just play en die and respawn untill you have enough. So, the casual player is catered to. Then there's a mode where you have limited lives - you can respawn, but only a few times. And of course the real roguelike - one life. Die, you're out of luck.\n\nIt's huge. I have been playing for hours and hours and so far have only made it to the 'second half' of the game twice. I am estimating that running a single game end-to-end will take you at least 4-6 hours. Though, I moght be a slowpoke - perhaps better, more experienced players can do it in a few hours less.\n\nIt's got possibilities. Like, there are so many ways to develop a character. So far I have been fiddling around with one class to see what get's me farther and farther into the game and that is working. You play, you die. Think, why did I die? Adapt in the next character.\n\nIt has a very smart way of lulling you into a false sense of security by allowing you to kill most critters on your path, then hit you from behind with some nasty rare radom boss.\n\nThere is mods out the various orifices too - enou8gh to adapt is to a format you like better.\n\nOh, I'd also like to add that there is a massive fanbase on the formums where the (I do believe it's one guy?) developer DarkGod hangs out too - and he actually posts, listens and helps out when you are in trouble.\n\nTrust me - if you are into roguelikes or like fiddling around for aeons with character builds, this is something you want.\nIf you are not the masochistic type, it has ways of lettign you in gently and be much more forgiving.","January 2, 2015","true","183.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun messing around with the good amount of builds you can make in this game and there are more characters you can unlock from completing quests and such. The game itself isnt easy, Like most rogue-likes you're going to find yourself at first struggling, asking yourself what do I do next. Fear not. You have the mighty Z button, the Z button allows you to auto-explore and find random things in the stage,Take note that the auto-explore will go through everything around the stage so be careful you might find that special enemy you don't wan't to find along the way.\n\nBack to the game, There is a great soundtrack to the game, Which obviously helps greatly to immerse you more into the environment.\nThe game may look old but there is something about that art-style that is just appealing and fun to watch.\n\nIn gameplay terms you'll find yourself killed alot at first as you'll probably wonder what the hell every skill does or how to approach monsters/towns etc. But fear not there is a tutorial for the new players if they decide to take it.\n\nThe game itself has a nice character progression pattern, as in you gain levels, find gold and items/equipments that will drop or just be generater in the world you play in, this adds to the whole adventure experience and people who love loot will have a good time going through this game.\n\nYou can select different difficulties and unlike most rogue-likes you have the option to actually return to the game a few times depending on what mode you pick (obviously if you pick the harder ones once you die, you ded as hell).\n\nOverall Tales of Maj'Eyal is a great rogue-like game and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a game that they can actually feel like they're playing an old school rogue-like with modern touches to it.\n\nOn another note you can try the game on the developers website for free, But i'm not sure it contains all the content of the game so I would recommend buying it if you enjoy/like it.\n","June 28, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Permadeath in such a world is a rewarding experience. It challenges the player to be better, learn and achieve what at first seemed beyond reach. The RPG elements adds a breath of fresh air to the roguelike genre, allowing both cookie cutter and more exploratory builds to achieve hard won, weary glory.\n\nA special mention should go to the lore and world building. No large, tired, trope laden exposition exists here. Instead the world is littered with lore and item lore that slowly builds up a far greater picture through multiple playthroughs of a living, damaged world.

This is a good solid game that looks like a mix between Ragnarok(also freeware but you might need dosbox to play) and Din's curse. This and ragnarok are two of the most true to form roguelikes I can think of as most have you go level to level with creatures at the same equivilent level to fight. in TOME you can blunder into a dungeon that is way to hard for your level or have just a random monster(s) in a vault that is way beyond your means.

While it may not be a "procedurally generated" map, and there isn't anything that has a chance of being good or bad (ex: quaff potion, turns out to be a fire potion killing you) except for some abilities that teleport you randomly within a certain tile range (which you can get control of later on anyways). Without those, why should I still play it you ask? For one, this game is incredibly hard (which is a good thing). Every mistake adds up, and you have to think about how you approach enemies depending on your character, which brings me to my favorite part.

Classes are more rpg oriented, each having unique multiple attacks and tactics to use during the battles.\n\nTL;DR:\nGreat game, you should play it.

Permadeath in such a world is a rewarding experience. It challenges the player to be better, learn and achieve what at first seemed beyond reach.

Tons of unlockables. Great character customization. Immensely strategic turn based combat. Retro graphics. Fans of classic games like Exile and Avernum will enjoy this game immensley. Permadeth mode best of all!\n\nSo after a year of playing and almost 200 hours put into the game, I feel secure adding some more comments about the game. I can say, hands down, that this game is AMAZING! There is an unbelievable amount of content and lore that only keeps growing due to an active modding community and DLC from Dark God. I'm still discovering new, unexplored, areas of the game. I haven't even unlocked all the character creation paths yet. Best of all is the difficulty of this game. Any boss encounter will prove to be a challange, every encounter will become one if you raise the difficulty at all. One word of warning, this game is ADDICTIVE. I literally haven't been able to put it down since the DLC was released. Each class feels completely different. The only true drawback of the game is it's UI. At times the interface can be difficult. Some actions, escpecially in the inventory, take to many key strokes to accomplish. The menu hot keys are oddly selected too. Item information is displayed in a pretty hard to look at format. It seems the game's interface was designed with the keyboard in mind and not the mouse. The item filters need to be more specific. Being able to view the items based on armor type or weapon class would be handy. The hotbars get pretty confusing torwards the end of the game, when your character starts having more abilities than theres convinient room on the hotbar. Two, or more, active hotbars could alleviate this a little. It definitely takes some getting used to to become adept at interfacing with the game efficiently. Overall though, I would give this game the highest marks on content, lore, gameplay, and challenge!","January 19, 2014","true","221.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun messing around with the good amount of builds you can make in this game and there are more characters you can unlock from completing quests and such. The game itself isnt easy, Like most rogue-likes you're going to find yourself at first struggling, asking yourself what do I do next. Fear not. You have the mighty Z button, the Z button allows you to auto-explore and find random things in the stage,Take note that the auto-explore will go through everything around the stage so be careful you might find that special enemy you don't wan't to find along the way.\n\nBack to the game, There is a great soundtrack to the game, Which obviously helps greatly to immerse you more into the environment.\nThe game may look old but there is something about that art-style that is just appealing and fun to watch.\n\nIn gameplay terms you'll find yourself killed alot at first as you'll probably wonder what the hell every skill does or how to approach monsters/towns etc. But fear not there is a tutorial for the new players if they decide to take it.\n\nThe game itself has a nice character progression pattern, as in you gain levels, find gold and items/equipments that will drop or just be generater in the world you play in, this adds to the whole adventure experience and people who love loot will have a good time going through this game.\n\nYou can select different difficulties and unlike most rogue-likes you have the option to actually return to the game a few times depending on what mode you pick (obviously if you pick the harder ones once you die, you ded as hell).\n\nOverall Tales of Maj'Eyal is a great rogue-like game and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a game that they can actually feel like they're playing an old school rogue-like with modern touches to it.\n\nOn another note you can try the game on the developers website for free, But i'm not sure it contains all the content of the game so I would recommend buying it if you enjoy/like it.\n","June 28, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I play so that each time, I can get just a little bit further. That's the thing about roguelikes. They aren't about learning to play the game, and then playing it. You can't be said to know how to play the game until you've won.\n\nFor a game I've never gotten past the first third despite having played it for over 70 hours, I can't really claim that the sameyness keeps me from playing. I don't feel stuck or feel the need to consult strategy guides; the process of learning in ToME is rewarding. It'd be awesome if levels had more variety and the worldmap was randomized, but I don't think that would make it more replayable.","January 18, 2015","true","88.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't want the "starting" excitement to overwhelm me.\nAfter having played this game with several characters, I can say that every playthrough, I get more and more excited about this game. For me, this game is difficult and hardcore, I am not that experienced with rpg's but this game makes me want to be and every playthrough, I feel like I have learned new things.\nFor the first time, I carefully think about choices I make, what should I level up, how should I handle this enemy. For the first time, I take my time for every turn (usually with this kind of games, I rush through my turns as if it was real-time). The game makes me want to use my skills and intelligence and for me, this is a first-timer.\n\nThe funny thing is, I had this game marked as "Not Interested" originally, but came here by reading a review under another -not so good- game. That other game had much better graphics, but I don't care about graphics. On the other hand, because I had mostly been dissapointed by roguelikes with low-quality graphics (although TOME actually has relative good graphics for its genre) I had never looked at this game in detail. It was after that other review and seeing that people have actually spent a whole year in playtime on this game that I got interested.\n\nThat's sad... because this game is REALLY worth it. And it certainly is worth the price. I bought it at -30% and now I feel like they could easily charge 3x the price (and even more) and it would still be worth it. This game needs a commercial boost :-)\n\nI am really enjoying this game, dying all the time and stuff like that. I prefer adventure-mode because I can die several times before it is game over, but I still don't want to die (like you could play through in exploration mode) so it still makes me try to play it roguelike (which is too hard for me at this time).\n\nI also like how this game builds up unlocks: especially for me, being not that experienced, I like that in the beginning not all character types can be played and must be unlocked. It makes me build up my knowledge about the game and probably only when I am ready to learn about new types of character, they will be unlocked.\n\nI wonder if I will stop buying other games on steam now for the next year because if I look at other people playing this game (2500 hours of playtime), it seems like I will never get bored with this game and will never need another game :-).\n\nI think I can safely say that this game is for all kinds of RPG players: the beginners and the very experienced.\n\nBuy it! Buy it now! :-)\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention: it has a very very very good community. In game, you have chatrooms and when you have a question, you can ask it there and there's almost always someone who answers.","January 17, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It essentially counts the same as if you are a donator on the official web site, giving you the same benefits they get.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a roguelike. That means randomly generated dungeons, items, monsters, etc... and permanent death. ToME actually has an optional mode where you get multiple lives also, in case you are new to roguelikes and want to ease into things. What ToME does that stands out from the rest is have a very interesting class and race system, which is very customizable to your taste. For example, as a Rogue you can choose to specialize in stealthy gameplay with devastating sneak attacks, deadly traps, or a brawling play style with dirty fighting techniques that give you the advantage when facing foes. The choice is yours, and in addition to stats, each race gives a pool of 4 unique abilities you can also choose to train up, making different race and class combinations play somewhat differently.\n\nAnother feature of ToME that I don't normally see is an overworld system. After clearing your introduction dungeon you'll be thrust out into the open world, free to explore and attempt to clear dangerous forests, dungeons, and hideouts of foes. It makes the game feel large, like your adventures are part of the world of Maj'Eyal and not just isolated to a single deep dungeon.\n\nFinally, ToME is extremely mod-friendly. Don't want to unlock all the classes and races yourself? There is a mod for that. There are mods for new items, new classes, new dungeons, etc... You name it.\n\nI am not yet very far into the game, but I have no reservations recommending it, especially giving it a try for free on their website: http://te4.org.","December 24, 2013","true","314.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathshinobi/recommended/259680/","deathshinobi","DS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathshinobi/","110 products in account","Tales of Maj'Eyal is a very rewarding Roguelike game.  Before you buy the game, though, you should consider whether the Roguelike genre appeals to you because this game is not a typical dungeon crawling RPG like Diablo II.  It seems that most of the negative reviews for this game have come from players who failed to consider their purchase.\n\nThe basic premise of a Roguelike game is randomly or semi-randomly generated dungeons with randomly generated monsters and randomly generated loot.  Luck is an integral part of the Roguelike genre, and most of them allow you only one life.  Skilled players can work with what they're given to create a powerful character, and get through very challenging randomly generated rooms/bosses/dungeons/etc.  Less skilled players might find that they die.  Often.  Tales of Maj'Eyal is unusually 'fair' for a Roguelike game, but you shouldn't mistake that to mean that it's easy, because it isn't easy at all.  It gives you extra lives, and most of the time the monsters are beatable for your level (even if they say that they're a much higher level).  The game even warns you when you're about to open a special room (rooms that often times have very numerous and/or difficult and/or high level monsters) or treasure chest (which usually spawns enemies).  Occasionally you'll run into a very difficult pack of mobs or a difficult boss, and if you lose all of your lives, then you die.  That's life, and that's how the Roguelike genre works.  Hopefully you unlocked something to explore for your next playthrough.\n\nThe appeal of this game is that there is a LOT of stuff to unlock.  You'll find yourself accidentally unlocking new classes, races, and even game modes all the time, unless you're using an unlockables guide, in which case you probably aren't having as much fun as you could be having!  There's also a great amount of class diversity, tons of classes, and even lots of depth within each class.  As a bonus, the game features a really cool world to explore and learn about.  There isn't so much of a 'storyline' but there is really a lot of lore to learn, and there are many things to discover about the current shape of the world, past events, and even letters and such from random adventurers or random people that give insight on a particular dungeon or event.  If you're anything like me, then you'll love that part of the game, but if you're one of those people who never read anything in a game, ever, then that's fine too because you can easily skip lore popups and keep playing.  If these things sound appealing to you, then great, you'll love the game.  If the Roguelike premise doesn't sound very appealing, then you may want to look elsewhere, but don't buy the game and then make a negative review if you can't even get past the first level (also here's a tip: don't play a Shalore on your first playthrough because they have a very difficult starting zone... I suspect that people who found the first level to be 'impossible' probably played a Shalore).\n\nThe UI definitely has its shortcomings, which is probably the worst thing about the game, but all-in-all I think it's a very impressive game for having been designed by one person, and well worth your 7 dollars to buy.  Also you can play it for free at te4.org, so if you're on the fence about whether to purchase it, feel free to play for, well, free.","April 23, 2014","true","232.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've truly been blown away by the quality of the experience ToME offers, as you can see by the crazy amount of time I've spent after only a few days of owning it.\n\nToME manages to stay incredibly faithful to the roguelike genre, offering the big three parts (turn based gameplay, randomized maps, and permanent death) but providing it in a way much more relevant to today's gamers; there are varying levels of difficulty, allowing you to play with extra lives or turn off permadeath (at the cost of not being able to earn achievements or upload your character to the server to show off) and it comes pre-loaded with a beautiful graphics pack so you needn't play in ASCII if you'd rather not.\n\nThe amount of content in the game is fantastic and the randomization handled well to provide excellent replayability and a truly enjoyable experience; it can also be tuned to provide that insanely grueling challenge that Rogue and Dwarf Fortress survivors like to call "Fun."\n\nIf you're a fan of the genre at all (or have been interested in the past and have been turned off by some of the more hardcore features), I find myself unable to provide eloquent enough words to praise this game's virtues- get it!

You choose from a variety of races and a variety of classes, and even more can be unlocked of each. Depending on your race and/or class, you'll start out in a specific Zone(or dungeon if you'd like). Once you finish that Zone, or before, you can return the World Map, in which you can explore it looking for more dungeons, or look for towns in which you can purchase items or find quests.\n\nThis isn't like The Elder Scrolls, where most of the game is scaled to your level or ability, each Zone has a certain difficulty, and until you're more familiar with how difficult each one is, it's better to follow the quest log. It's true that with very careful and skillful management of your spells and/techniques that you can finish a Zone that's a bit higher than you level, but there's a limit that's very quickly reached.\n\nEach of the Zones layouts are randomly generated, though they always have the same theme(forest, cave, dungeon, etc.). However, the World Map is mostly static, meaning it doesn't shift too much between games. There are 4 main towns in the beginning for instance, 3 of them having 2 beginner Zones right next to them. These 4, and their Zones, are always in the same spot. While there are a couple more Zones that are found in the same spot, the location of all the other Zones(mostly the 'side' ones) shifts around the map between games\n\nFor the actual skills you use, they're divided up into 2 categories: Class and Generic. Class skills are like they sound: each Class has many skill trees with for skills in each, and it's up to you how you want to level them, though some trees have a level requirement. Then there's Generic. This category is mostly the same between Classes, however some Classes add an extra Generic tree or 2. Many Races also have extra Generic trees, though Races with buffs or extra trees are of course balanced in other ways.\n\nEach Race has different bonuses and penalties to their stats, health, and experience rate, along with their Race Specific Generic Trees. So obviously some Races will be better suited to certain play styles. While some races and classes cannot be used together for Story/lore reasons, all class/race combinations are viable throughout the game, though you may need to play a bit smarter in some cases. One last thing about races: While they all have bonuses and penalties, the 'Cornac Human' is the exception in that it has no bonuses, no extra Generic Trees, and no penalties of any sort, and I recommend that if you want to try a new class but don't know what to expect, the 'Cornac Human' is a good default choice. Oh wait, Cornacs start with 1 category point, as some categories need to be unlocked with a point before you can start investing in it's skills, You can also just use the Category Point to give yourself an extra Infusion/Rune Slot, I'll talk more of this later.\n\nAs for items, they are Armor, Weapons, Jewellery, Tools, and Infusions/Runes. All items except Infusions/Runes are randomly generated for the most part, the exception being Legendary/Unique items, which are always the same, but have very unique bonuses and sometimes penalties. They sometimes even give you a skill(with a cooldown), though Tools always give a skill while they are worn.\n\nInfusions/Runes are items which will pretty much let you 'equip' a skill, such as Healing, Regen, etc. You only have so many slots though. All classes and races, no matter the combination, start with 3 slots. When you get a Category point every 5 levels(or first if you're a Cornac), you can opt to use it to give you an extra slot. If you try to use an Infusion/Rune when all slots are filled, you'll be asked if you want to replace a currently equipped Infusion/Rune. If you do so, you do NOT get it back.\n\nI'll cut the review short here, else I'll waffle all day. I definitely recommend this game for any roguelike and/or RPG fan. Please keep in mind that there is a free version on their site. This version is the paid version, in which it gives you an item vault(that must be reached through a semi-difficult dungeon) with a few slots to transfer items or store them between characters. The paid version also has an extra class to play with, along with an extra mode. The extra class I won't name as it changes. The most recently added class is for the paid version only. When a new one is added, the previous one becomes free. The extra game mode is 'Exploration', which is the same as normal, but gives you unlimited lives.\n\nPlease note that the DLC listed below is not a part of the free version, though they can also be purchased on their and played in the DRM free version.","November 6, 2014","true","27.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Take your time.\n+ Not for the faint of heart - Remember when games used to be hard? So does this developer.\n+ Unlockable races and classes - Replayability, anyone?\n+ Dungeons combine randomness with structure - Key elements are always there, but many elements change between adventures.\n+ The price is super low - You could buy this game 8 or 9 times for the price of one AAA game.\n+ Active development - Last update was about 2 weeks before this review.\n\nPotential Negatives:\n- You're going to die - a lot. Some frustration will be had.\n- Graphics are nothing special, although it does come in old-school @ style display (which I use).\n- Not the best music, put on your favorite album instead.\n\nTL;DR: A rich, impressive Rogue-like for fans of old-school games (no CoD 'bros' need apply).","November 12, 2014","true","597.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's hard, very hard.\n\nOkay, so its a roguelike. But it has options to make it less unforgiving, up to a mode where you can just play en die and respawn untill you have enough. So, the casual player is catered to. Then there's a mode where you have limited lives - you can respawn, but only a few times. And of course the real roguelike - one life. Die, you're out of luck.\n\nIt's huge. I have been playing for hours and hours and so far have only made it to the 'second half' of the game twice. I am estimating that running a single game end-to-end will take you at least 4-6 hours. Though, I moght be a slowpoke - perhaps better, more experienced players can do it in a few hours less.\n\nIt's got possibilities. Like, there are so many ways to develop a character. So far I have been fiddling around with one class to see what get's me farther and farther into the game and that is working. You play, you die. Think, why did I die? Adapt in the next character.\n\nIt has a very smart way of lulling you into a false sense of security by allowing you to kill most critters on your path, then hit you from behind with some nasty rare radom boss.\n\nThere is mods out the various orifices too - enou8gh to adapt is to a format you like better.\n\nOh, I'd also like to add that there is a massive fanbase on the formums where the (I do believe it's one guy?) developer DarkGod hangs out too - and he actually posts, listens and helps out when you are in trouble.\n\nTrust me - if you are into roguelikes or like fiddling around for aeons with character builds, this is something you want.\nIf you are not the masochistic type, it has ways of lettign you in gently and be much more forgiving.","January 2, 2015","true","183.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It combines many beautifully nostalgic concepts from rpgs from the good old days.  Talents and "feats" and stats will all be very familiar to the bearded rpg appreciators and  can be picked up quickly by any newcomers that might happen upon this game.  All the traits and talents and character stats all have very in-depth write-ups when you mousover them, and since the game is true to the turn-based concept, you can truly play at your own pace.\n\nThis game comes closest to the feel of that old game I spent so many hours on back in the days of "shareware", Castle of the Winds.

You choose from a variety of races and a variety of classes, and even more can be unlocked of each. Depending on your race and/or class, you'll start out in a specific Zone(or dungeon if you'd like). Once you finish that Zone, or before, you can return the World Map, in which you can explore it looking for more dungeons, or look for towns in which you can purchase items or find quests.\n\nThis isn't like The Elder Scrolls, where most of the game is scaled to your level or ability, each Zone has a certain difficulty, and until you're more familiar with how difficult each one is, it's better to follow the quest log. It's true that with very careful and skillful management of your spells and/techniques that you can finish a Zone that's a bit higher than you level, but there's a limit that's very quickly reached.\n\nEach of the Zones layouts are randomly generated, though they always have the same theme(forest, cave, dungeon, etc.). However, the World Map is mostly static, meaning it doesn't shift too much between games. There are 4 main towns in the beginning for instance, 3 of them having 2 beginner Zones right next to them. These 4, and their Zones, are always in the same spot. While there are a couple more Zones that are found in the same spot, the location of all the other Zones(mostly the 'side' ones) shifts around the map between games\n\nFor the actual skills you use, they're divided up into 2 categories: Class and Generic. Class skills are like they sound: each Class has many skill trees with for skills in each, and it's up to you how you want to level them, though some trees have a level requirement. Then there's Generic. This category is mostly the same between Classes, however some Classes add an extra Generic tree or 2. Many Races also have extra Generic trees, though Races with buffs or extra trees are of course balanced in other ways.\n\nEach Race has different bonuses and penalties to their stats, health, and experience rate, along with their Race Specific Generic Trees. So obviously some Races will be better suited to certain play styles. While some races and classes cannot be used together for Story/lore reasons, all class/race combinations are viable throughout the game, though you may need to play a bit smarter in some cases. One last thing about races: While they all have bonuses and penalties, the 'Cornac Human' is the exception in that it has no bonuses, no extra Generic Trees, and no penalties of any sort, and I recommend that if you want to try a new class but don't know what to expect, the 'Cornac Human' is a good default choice. Oh wait, Cornacs start with 1 category point, as some categories need to be unlocked with a point before you can start investing in it's skills, You can also just use the Category Point to give yourself an extra Infusion/Rune Slot, I'll talk more of this later.\n\nAs for items, they are Armor, Weapons, Jewellery, Tools, and Infusions/Runes. All items except Infusions/Runes are randomly generated for the most part, the exception being Legendary/Unique items, which are always the same, but have very unique bonuses and sometimes penalties. They sometimes even give you a skill(with a cooldown), though Tools always give a skill while they are worn.\n\nInfusions/Runes are items which will pretty much let you 'equip' a skill, such as Healing, Regen, etc. You only have so many slots though. All classes and races, no matter the combination, start with 3 slots. When you get a Category point every 5 levels(or first if you're a Cornac), you can opt to use it to give you an extra slot. If you try to use an Infusion/Rune when all slots are filled, you'll be asked if you want to replace a currently equipped Infusion/Rune. If you do so, you do NOT get it back.\n\nI'll cut the review short here, else I'll waffle all day. I definitely recommend this game for any roguelike and/or RPG fan. Please keep in mind that there is a free version on their site. This version is the paid version, in which it gives you an item vault(that must be reached through a semi-difficult dungeon) with a few slots to transfer items or store them between characters.

It does an excellent job of providing everything that makes a roguelike great in a format that is extremely accessible both for hardcore fans of the genre as well as more casual players looking to get their feet wet.  The sheer amount of content in this game is incredible.  The storyline and lore are deep and enjoyable while the gameplay, particularly the combat, remain consistently engaging.\n\nTales of Maj'Eyal does a good job of easing a new player into the world and game mechanics by restricting the initial race and class offerings and expands outward with a number of persistent unlockables including new races, classes, and items that will become available to your future characters as you progress forward through additional sessions.  The distinct classes (particularly with different race pairings) provide tremendously distinct play styles that will keep you on your toes and force you to adjust your gameplay to find success.\n\nTo sum this up simply:  This game is outstanding, anyone with even the most remote interest would do well to pick it up, it won't let you down (and in all likelihood will keep you playing and having fun for an exceptionally long time to come).","November 8, 2014","true","52.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's been a staple of any roguelike fans for several years and is great to see it brought to Steam where it has really made the most of unlockable/achievements and workshop to make it even easier to get some of the many great mods for it.\n\nIt has several notable changes from other roguelikes, foremost it's abilities system use a variety of different resources and are mostly about managing cooldowns. There's no health/mana pot chugging here which takes some of the tedium away from stacking potions to thinking about which abilities to use when.\n\nAlso, the storyline and overworld is static, while individual level layout and most npcs are randomized. This has it's own plus and minuses. Each area has it's own lore and strategy which planning for is part of the game and you wouldn't be able to do as much for completely randomized dungeons. On the other hand, if you are like me and like to rush to your death and try as many classes as possible, replaying the same quests and areas can start getting a little boring. However the game has a lot of different content and several starting areas to help alleviate the tedium of replaying the same starting areas over and over for each character.\n\nReally a must have for any roguelike fan, it does a lot of the traditional elements very well while bringing a lot of unique flavor and strategy of its own.","October 29, 2014","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tons of unlockables. Great character customization. Immensely strategic turn based combat. Retro graphics. Fans of classic games like Exile and Avernum will enjoy this game immensley. Permadeth mode best of all!\n\nSo after a year of playing and almost 200 hours put into the game, I feel secure adding some more comments about the game. I can say, hands down, that this game is AMAZING! There is an unbelievable amount of content and lore that only keeps growing due to an active modding community and DLC from Dark God. I'm still discovering new, unexplored, areas of the game. I haven't even unlocked all the character creation paths yet. Best of all is the difficulty of this game. Any boss encounter will prove to be a challange, every encounter will become one if you raise the difficulty at all. One word of warning, this game is ADDICTIVE. I literally haven't been able to put it down since the DLC was released. Each class feels completely different. The only true drawback of the game is it's UI. At times the interface can be difficult. Some actions, escpecially in the inventory, take to many key strokes to accomplish. The menu hot keys are oddly selected too. Item information is displayed in a pretty hard to look at format. It seems the game's interface was designed with the keyboard in mind and not the mouse. The item filters need to be more specific. Being able to view the items based on armor type or weapon class would be handy. The hotbars get pretty confusing torwards the end of the game, when your character starts having more abilities than theres convinient room on the hotbar. Two, or more, active hotbars could alleviate this a little. It definitely takes some getting used to to become adept at interfacing with the game efficiently. Overall though, I would give this game the highest marks on content, lore, gameplay, and challenge!","January 19, 2014","true","221.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was originally posted in January 2015 as ‘negative’, and is from March 2015 onwards rated as ‘positive.’ In addition, the content has been altered to reflect recent changes to the game.\nFirst of all, know that this is not a ‘rogue-lite’. I have yet to see the final level, and there are others on the forums who have played for hundreds of hours and have yet to win the game.\nFor the TL;DR people: The game is amazing, but completing it on normal difficulty will take hundreds of hours because the learning curve is steep, and end-game balance depends on creating the most powerful build you can – theory crafting is a must, and if you don’t, the game will become unwinnable 30 hours before you realize it. For the rest of us, read on.\nToME has 26 classes at the time of this writing, all of which feel and play very differently. Like most RPGs, skill points are gained upon leveling and can be used for both active and passive effects. The skills for each class are unique and allow players to develop their own playstyles, though generally each class has its own style of combat and a playstyle that rewards sticking to their class-specific strengths. Summoners draw hordes of creatures to overwhelm opponents, archmages channel elements to great effect over an area, and rogues set traps and use stealth to outmaneuver or outwit opponents. There are even more creative classes in here, like a time warden (or time mage) that specializes in temporal effects and paradoxes.\nThe world has tons of surprises and interesting levels/areas to explore, acceptable story and interaction (for an old-school roguelike) and though nothing ever changes, the vast variety of mechanics assured that the game did not get old for me after 100 hours of gameplay, and likely will not for another 100 hours.\nBut Tales of Maj’Eyal does have its problems. The first and perhaps least bothersome is a learning curve that feels more like a cliff than a slope.\nThe tutorial explains a little of the game's mechanics, but understanding is better gained by blundering through the world and slowly learning what each of the many confusing formulas and statistics mean, and how important they are to the core gameplay. It takes dedication to keep coming back when mountains of unknown skills and abilities assail you from every side, and through trial-and-error, learn to slowly overcome that mountain. Perseverance does pay off – I actually enjoyed the game very much once I crossed the barrier between hopeless bungler and still-hopeless-but-educated noob.\nThe larger problem is that in order to win the game, the player’s character must be designed for perfection – built to optimal capacity with a full understanding of the many talents, stat formulas, status effects and saving throws present in the game engine. It’s not enough just to go with the most damage, or discover the best damage reduction, or center your build around strategic options – you must do all of these things, and do them with the dedication of a crazed League of Legends professional gunning for the gold.\nThis is where the game fell apart previously –it can become unwinnable very early on, and new players will never even know. They may even feel overpowered for a while, as they make one-strike KOs against hordes of enemies and pass tens of dungeons without a serious challenge in any of them. Rares, elites, and bosses fall without challenge - then suddenly, a belligerent abomination of a boss-class monstrosity strikes, and they find themselves hopelessly outmatched, their only recourse to grind for levels.\nSo they go to a new dungeon – and it happens again. Another new dungeon – wait, were the normals this hard before? And why can’t I use my spells? My abilities? Where did everyone go? And… how did I get one-shot by THAT?\nPlayers be warned: No matter how many lives you have, you can make a mistake in your character build early on and not realize that your character is doomed until late-game, when you have already invested thirty-or-more hours into their development. With permadeath, obviously, you may not live long enough to realize your character build is impossible to win with. But even with unlimited lives, you will eventually reach the point where the bosses are impossible, and no matter how well you fight, how clever your tactics, you have no option but to die – or quit. Before the 1.3.0 update, this meant that you must start the game over again from the beginning.\nThis is why my review changed from negative to positive. While limited and full-permadeath players will still have to deal with the intense frustrations of sub-optimal builds, there is hope for those playing with unlimited lives after the 1.3.0 update: Full talent re-spec is available at all times, so if you’ve created a build that seems sub-optimal to your playstyle or eventually becomes self-defeating, you can easily change your skills to accommodate your newfound knowledge or equipment. Be warned, however, that stat points and category points are still permanent, so consider playing a Cornac (+1 cat points) your first time and keeping some stat points in reserve for future use while you learn the ins and outs of your chosen class.\nAlso, be warned that there is no way to carry multiple save files for your character in this game. The game will save on entering and exiting a dungeon, as well as upon making most major decisions, and you will have to live with the consequences of your actions.\nSo to recap: Tales of Maj'Eyal as it is an interesting game that supports a wide variety of skill sets and play styles, though impressive knowledge of the game mechanics that can only be acquired through vigilant study required to develop a successful playstyle. Full talent re-spec alleviates (but not eliminates) the steep learning curve, but if you like RPG roguelikes with unique classes and deep strategy, investing your time in this game will reward you with probably the best roguelike you’ve ever played. Just be prepared to invest heavily.\n*Full disclosure here - I played the game on 'normal' difficulty for every playthrough. There is an easier difficulty that decreases the monsters' strength/abilities by 30%, but it does not give classes, races or achievements and so it does not appeal to those like me who want to feel they are accomplishing something while playing.","January 2, 2015","true","436.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","14"

While it may not be a "procedurally generated" map, and there isn't anything that has a chance of being good or bad (ex: quaff potion, turns out to be a fire potion killing you) except for some abilities that teleport you randomly within a certain tile range (which you can get control of later on anyways). Without those, why should I still play it you ask? For one, this game is incredibly hard (which is a good thing). Every mistake adds up, and you have to think about how you approach enemies depending on your character, which brings me to my favorite part.

Classes are more rpg oriented, each having unique multiple attacks and tactics to use during the battles.\n\nTL;DR:\nGreat game, you should play it.

I haven't even tried to play arena or infinite dungeon yet, I'm still just trying to beat normal mode and like I started this review with, I've played over 100 hours.\n\n\n10/10, better time sink than WoW ever was.","June 4, 2015","true","111.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't too sure about it when I bought it, but it turned out to be better than I could ever hope for.

For instance: I killed a certain boss character, and it gave me a transmorgrification box for the rest of my plays. Another example is that when I reached level 10 (i think), it unlocked a new character class for my next characters.\n\nIt had me playing for hours, and still wanting to come back and play some more.","April 21, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is incredibly fun, has many different possible playstyles, builds, classes, races, modes, and an incredibly high replay value. The story is great, the art is great, the gameplay is great, the music is great, this game is great all around! If you like any roguelike, specifically any tile based roguelike, you are going to really enjoy this game. It's not even that expensive of a game! Support the creators of this game and go get it! Watch out, though. This game can get difficult.","April 21, 2015","true","135.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not want to get addicted to it, but it sucks you in. One more character, one more level. It makes you want to understand it, to learn, to improve... and then you lose another character you've spent half a day on, and start a new one. I am not proud of the time I've been spending on this game, but it's like digital crack.","March 29, 2015","true","40.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
