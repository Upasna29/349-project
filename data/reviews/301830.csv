Keep in mind it IS a game for children, however, there's just enough challenge to make it a good, fun play. You can choose your level of difficulty as well, ranging from easy all the way to Brave. No, you're not going to find the greatest graphics, but it's certainly worth the money spent if you're looking for a simple yet entertaining adventure.","October 19, 2014","true","10.7"," 35 of 56 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","35","56","0","0"

I purchased this game when it was 50% off.  Usually, movie themed games are usually bad and some are downright garbage.This one is not. It's actually a pretty good 3d action platformer. The puzzles are a bit on the easy side of course. You got voice acting by the voice of Merida (Kelly McDonald).I find that the game can be challenging on Brave difficulty.  I strongly recommend using a controller for this game. Keyboard users beware! Don't get me wrong. my review is not biased because i love Merida.\n\n","December 30, 2014","true","8.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

ONly the cameras sometimes a bit wonky and wont show you always your point for landing (while jumping)\n\n\nA few words to the Combat:\nIt changes between melee and bow, with 4 different elemnts, sounds maybe a bit strange at first, but allwos you to do, fast and strong combos. You need one of these "elements" to get more damage on enemies, they got mixed later what makes the fighting more interessting.\n-\nOh yeah and you got an shop for buying skills, and thats REALLY a lot of skills, you cant buy all in one Run, thats one more point to make your run more interessting.\n\n\nSO many words for a game like THIS but, i think the game is REALLY STRONG UNDERRATED, i think just EVERYTHING is right with the game. (I wish more games like this (really.))\n\nSo if you want an platform like "hack and slay with combos" for young and old, with not to hard challenges for a bit relaxing you do NOTHING, NOTHING wrong.\n\nDEFINITELY the 20Bucks worth.","July 22, 2015","true","7.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/justx2/recommended/301830/","justx2","JuStX2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/justx2/","95 products in account","Game doesn't have overly graphic violence but it could easily earn E10+ Rating unlike every other game in the Disney Princesses and Fairies Pack which minus Tangled would probably only qualify for E. And what do you know, a game in that pack actually has a HEALTH meter, that does something for a change. These qualties make it a kinda odd fit for the pack which is targetted at young girls. Still the game is of good enough quality to the point that even someone of adult age-group (other than myself - I'm a bit of an oddball) could actually find it enjoyable. Throwing this game into the pack seems like their trying to toss a bone to the older princesses, some of whom may be a bit tomboyish.\n\nAs an individual game the design is not overly unique, plays similiar to Trine or Zelda-style games. The controls take a little practice to get used to because the tutorials don't show key "letters" but rather "colors" that correspond to the keymap on the game's controls menu. Camera is automatic but it seems to keep a good prespective so far. Weapon choice makes a large difference in how quickly mobs go down, and charms further agument that process. In addition to Action/Adventure/RPG it has some puzzle elements, which if I do say so myself are kinda interesting; Still the game would be better if it allowed for Character Swap on-the-fly instead of only in certain scenes. Personally I hold no feelings of disinterest in the game hence a "good" review, but it doesn't stand out as something overly special either.","January 5, 2015","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Anyway, this is a fun game with really tight controls. There's quite a lot of variety in movement, combat and weapons and some really fast and fluent gameplay.  The graphics are probably Playstation 2 era style so they're a little dated if you find that sort of thing important (I don't). The animation however is very fluid, the voicework is quirky and well done, I just love that happy Scottish voice!\n\nA fun game to be played, yes even in co-op it's in there, with a smile on your face :-)","November 1, 2015","true","8.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I jumped into playing this game on the most difficult "Brave" setting (enemies have way more health and you die in 2-3 hits), so my review is in this context. Even then, it is pretty easy... particularly since you may find one of your arrow attacks extremely overpowered for practically all enemy types (despite them having elemental weaknesses to certain elemental arrows).  On this difficulty, some of the bosses do prove a genuinely difficult challenge though, as you die in 2 hits, and fight a giant creature on a crowded stage. You might die a lot in Dark Souls kinda way then. (I wanna add, to avoid any disappointment like I felt - no, you won't really get to fight Mor'du =( )\nLevel designs are linear, but are never really boring either... they're just the right length, I'd say.\n\nYou do have to suspend your disbelief a bit in some of Merida's skills... they gave her a double jump (*groan* at this trope, but it's useful given the wonky camera angles) and ninja/parkour wall jumps. And as skilled an archer as she is, she doesn't nock her arrows, just fires them quickly like a gun (holding the fire button, charges your arrows for elemental multi-shots).\n\nI like that you can upgrade your skills though, it has a slight, light-RPG feel to it... you won't get everything by the end of the game either. There is a Co-Op feature where a second player can play as a wisp. I didn't play with a friend, but experimented with it via keyboard a bit, and it reminds me a little bit of Tails in the classic Sonic games (game stays fixed on Merida; Wisp doesn't die, and can teleport back to Merida if lost).\nThere are small sequences you play as Merida's bear mum, where you just rampage and slaughter as many enemies as possible. It's not that fun, and controls are clunky too, but they're fortunately super short and easy. There are also short puzzles where you play as Merida's triplet brothers on each level. They are also super easy (designed for kids, after all). Fortunately, you can skip them when you revisit a stage too.\n\nControls:\nDefinitely recommended to play with a controller - controls are fairly solid! An enemy-lock on feature could've been nice, maybe, but you are quite busy running and dodging a variety of enemies. Could've been nice for bosses though. One of the control features I REALLY like that is kinda unique, is that you can fire at any direction you point via Right Analog Stick.\nCamera isn't bad... but there are times when it could be much better, especially when platform jumping (you'll need to use your shadow for context on where to properly land; there is no falling to your death, you simply quickly "teleport" back up with a little loss of health... so not a big deal), or hunting for secrets beyond the scope of the camera angles. It's also sorta problematic in boss fights when you move Merida "up" the stage, and your boss stays to the foreground, you can lose sight of your target entirely and could easily be killed for not seeing an incoming attack. That said, the fixed cameras otherwise do offer some nice cinematic feeling to the landscapes.\n\nArt Direction (Graphics/Sound):\nScenery is pretty, very lush and green (even if not super detailed) and loosely represent Scottish/Gaelic landscapes (though linear designs means none of the open Highlands). Character models, however, are not so great. Merida looks a bit unfinished, with these unintentional tired, baggy eyes. Bears look like plastic toys (not furry). I enjoy some of the cinematic hand-drawings (though they are limitly animated).\nNo real complaints on sound design, I enjoy the cinematic orchestral Celtic music, which are soaring and adventurous. Kelly Macdonald reprises her role, which is wonderful (because I love her and her voice!).\n\nOverall:\nIt's a fun, fairly solid kid's adventure/platformer game, even despite some shortcomings, and I recommend it too if you liked the movie... if you're an avid gamer, play it on "Brave" difficulty. Again, not hard, but the bosses pose a genuine challenge.","January 3","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have only played about an hour and a half so far but as a platformer it is rather fun. Kind of like Lego Star Wars meets Pixar Brave. Lots of things to bust open and many hidden things/areas to find. Just like the Lego games it has replayable levels to gain access to hidden areas once you attain new items in later levels. I actually enjoy the puzzles presented when you have to control the three brother bears. Not too challenging and fun. Game combat is also enjoyable, similar to most any dungeon crawler. I was nicely surprised when the game naturally recognized my cheap Logitech controller.

I try to enjoy this game but there are too many problems with it. When i first enter the game it is always flashing continously so i restart my computer twice and after that it i find it works... for a little bit. When i just think i've sorted everything out it gets me out of the game and says theres a problem with it and windows will try find the solution. No matter what i do i can't stop this and it annoys the crap out of me. Secondly while playing Brave i can't even get out of the game to message someone on Skype or quickly check something because when i go back on it, it starts flashing again. Thirdly when you earn a new ability from a chest and it shows you what to press it just comes up with coloured ovals, rectangles and squares. It has no key on them whatsoever, no numbers no letters, just colours. This really frustrates me as i then have to pause the game, go onto the controls continously and check how to do something. Also if my pc comes up with a message saying 10% left, plug in charger it gets me out of the game and then when i go back in it  also begins to flash! I've tried researching how to fix this problem and kept changing the resolution but nothing helps. I really want to enjoy this game and recommend it to everyone but it's impossible to play because of these reasons. Of course i will continue to play this amazing game but please oh please try and fix these problems! thank you :-).","February 27, 2015","false","6.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
