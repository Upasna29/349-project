From that description alone, it would seem doomed for genericity - but this is perhaps the most innovative, unique horror title of 2015.\n\nThe first chapter does a great job of familiarizing you with the game's quirkiness. You're granted a blunderbuss that shoots potatoes. You fight against almost laughably unintimidating spheres of moving black mass. The protagonist voices her lines emotionlessly, almost inaudibly. You may be tempted to write off the game right then and there, and unfortunately, many do.\n\nSylvio's debilitatingly bizarre presentation obscures an incredibly impressive gameplay mechanic that serves as the core of all the spine-chilling, goosebumps-giving, jaw-dropping moments in the game: the EVP audio equipment and its accompanying sound design. The true star of this game. (Sorry, Juliette!)\n\nUsing the audio equipment, you will be inspecting every corner of the map for ghostly sounds that you can record and subsequently play back and hunt for clues. Through backmasking, rewinding, fast-forwarding and slowing down the audio, you'll hear all sorts of voices from the beyond. Some are helpful, some are not, and some are even... hostile.\n\nI finished the game in roughly 10 hours, though you can complete it in a solid 8 if you're not interested in finding the many collectibles that shed more light on the stories you encounter. To be honest, the game overstays its welcome a bit towards the end, and drags a little in some parts. Fortunately, the synth-laden soundtrack and static-ridden locations in the game provide just enough of a dynamic feel to make it a worthwhile journey.\n\nAs a closing remark, the main complaints I have heard are about the voice of the protagonist, Juliette. It's a divisive voice that may make or break your experience with the game - but she doesn't speak much except for during seances, so I can't say I identify with the chagrin.\n\nOverall, I hold "Sylvio" as the most underrated horror title of the year, and recommend it if you're looking for something new out of the horror genre.","December 22, 2015","true","10.7"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","38","42","0","0"

Sylvio creates a very subtle, bizarre and uneasy atmosfere, and although I had trouble to understand the main plot, the surrounding stories about the people who died on the Saginaw Park are sinister and uncanny, such as the experience of interviewing ghosts and manipulating the audio to "translate" their speech. It's such an unique and intense experience that, the fact that Sylvio is not a very well polished game isn't really so important. Not going to forget this one very soon.","August 23, 2015","true","13.0"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

It has so much intrigue and atmosphere, that you want to keep playing and finding clues and recordings. The voice acting is very well done, and in my opinion really adds to the game. Graphically speaking, it is not the best looking game out there, but the gameplay and the attention to the audio and recording device is really what drives the narrative of this game.\n\nThe audio recorder and its place in the game are really well done. When you come across a recording with your mic out, the machine will automatically record it for you. You then can play it back and analyse it to your hearts content. Hear something strange? Play it backwards....still doesn't sound quite right play it backwards at super-slow speed. The recording device Is really the star of this game and you can tell alot of work and effort has gone into perfecting it.\n\nI really recommend this one if you are into horror/mystery type games, there have been a few jumpscares but nothing that scary so far. I also feel like I should mention the soundtrack, as it is reminiscent of old John Carpenter films like "The Thing", very synth heavy and really adds to the game. I honestly hope it is added as  DLC, I would like to buy it as well.","June 5, 2015","true","9.0"," 45 of 60 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","45","60","3","0"

It's a good thing, then, that the makers of Sylvio understand the importance of SOUND in a horror game.  In fact, with the exception of the trifling fact that they forgot to include the noise of your character's own FOOTSTEPS, they've pretty much based their entire game around it.  That's the good news.\n\nBut before we get too far into the good stuff, let's just concentrate on some early negative impressions.  Along with the whole "silent footsteps" thing, you'd be forgiven for thinking that your character possesses full-blown powers of LEVITATION, as she seems to almost "float" above the ground rather than travel about on terra firma like the rest of us.  She furthermore doesn't need her hands to hold flashlights and other objects in front of her.  Now, I know that such - let us say somewhat "abstracted" - interactive mechanics have hardly been uncommon since Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but when it's coupled with virtually nothing else which seems to "ground" your character in the real world...well, she almost might as well be one of the ghosts that she's chasing.  She also seems able to jump or fall down enormous distances without, say, breaking both her legs like any of us regular mortals would.\n\nLuckily for the game, though, it soon becomes interesting and unusual enough that I mostly - MOSTLY - managed to get past these reservations, at least until I quit the game altogether about four hours in.  One way or another, there's certainly no denying that for all its ambition and relative innovation, it could have used quite a bit more polish before being unleashed on an unsuspecting public (especially at that price).\n\nAnother thing which made it a tad hard for me to get into - something which all you staunchly anti-"handholding" people are gonna chalk up as a pro, so what would I know? - is that it takes a while to get the gist of what exactly it is that the game wants you to "do".  I mean, there's a lot of things in this game which are hardly intuitive:  Not the controls (un-remappable; C for flashlight?), not the story ("I'm just sorta, kinda, gonna go in this big spooky park place and, I dunno, maybe talk to some ghosts, I guess"), and not the part where you use your microphone and tape player to decipher words or short phrases which the dead offer up to you, then get on-screen "distance metres" to tell you where you're supposed to go next as your "reward" for the information uncovered in the messages.\n\nA few of the puzzles are admittedly quite clever, so there's definitely some good ideas here, and the actual "tape-decoding" bits are suitably spooky and novel in execution...helped in no small part by the fact that the ghostly voices are, to begin with, Euros speaking in what is clearly not their first language - i.e. English - so by the time that you slow down and speed up the voices, or play them in reverse, they ARE quite genuinely eerie-sounding!\n\nOh, and speaking of which, the voice acting is on the whole fairly decent - not great, but decent - and ♥♥♥♥ it, the GAME on the whole is pretty decent, if by no means perfect or astonishing.  There's still a few other reservations that I have - some part of me isn't entirely sure that they shouldn't have passed on the infrequent and borderline-pointless "combat" elements of the game, for example, and just opted for an out-and-out "walking simulator" - but in the end, it was the extreme repetition and overall TEDIUM of the gaming experience which did in the patience of this particular player.  I mean, I like a moody, snail-like pace as much as the next guy, but this game takes such "tasteful aesthetics" to new and frankly trying extremes.\n\nI'm actually looking forward to the announced sequel to this game, because I think they got quite a lot "right" this time out, but also quite a bit "wrong".  Undeniably interesting devs, in any case.  I'm not gonna go so far as to say they've done something truly "original" here - I've already gotten in trouble for such bold claims in Steam reviews of late - but yes, definitely "different", and definitely worth a look to anyone who considers themselves genuinely interested in the numerous possibilities which the horror genre currently presents to game designers (maybe best to wait for a significant sale, though, just to be on the safe side).\n\nVerdict: 7/10.","February 18","true","3.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Rather than the horror being based on monsters that chase you or pop scares, the horror in this game comes from your own discoveries as you take an old audio recorder and use it to recording the messages from the dead. Scrubbing the audio backwards and forwards and different speeds not only reveals clues to solving the puzzles that lie before you, but they also slowly help put together the story of what happened in Saginaw park piece-by-piece. Assumptions made early about what to the expect eventually become trumped by the recordings of people who were once there to experience the disaster and horrors that followed. Combat is rare and simply executed, with emphasis on the story.\n\nI'd also like to add a note about the soundtrack to this game. With a feel that brings to mind the early works of John Carpenter's films from the 70's and 80's, the music in this game is absolutely phenomonal and it's practically worth owning the soundtrack on it's own. It sets the mood for the game perfectly and can set the mood for a foggy, eerie day just the same.","July 18, 2015","true","13.1"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

At first glance its very obvious that it’s a first person Unity horror game, what with its very unpolished appearance, and the game is bit buggy and janky with some uneven and unfocused gameplay elements like awkward platforming, driving, and combat, but what really elevates the game to make it far superior to most of its indie horror brethren is the ghost recording mechanic and its atmosphere. Recording and deciphering the voices of the dead using an old reel to reel really sets up a creepy atmosphere, that while it won’t keep you up at night, it still really sets an unsettling tone. There are no jump scares here, just pure atmosphere. The soundtrack also really helps and other reviews have said it’s got this synthy John Carpenter movie vibe to it which is neat.\n\nSadly the penultimate level is bad, with convoluted design and gimmicks and the ending is just super abrupt and vague, even if you get all the piano sheets. The game itself could have had smaller levels in general like the cellar and the old house areas were, because sometimes there can be a little to much wandering around. Overall though considering this was pretty much a one man job it still is a neat game worth checking out. Sadly I don’t think the Kickstarter campaign for the sequel will make it, even though it looks like it would be an improvement over this one.","January 8","true","10.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The ghost bosses are fairly impressive and immersive.\n+ No optimization issues, unity engine runs fine here.\n+ Fantastic soundtrack, excellent voice acting and the in-game music is perhaps the best part of the game technically.\n+ Gameplay seems a bit complicated at the beginning, until you find out how to use the gadgets and especially the gun, since the puzzles are sometimes tricky (especially those that require the use of the gun). You get clues of your next goal by using a stereo microphone which records sounds and points the way to spiritual activity. You interview ghosts and with the reel recorder you analyze and find hidden clues. You use the gun to solve puzzles and defeat the bad ghosts. Beware the gun can be loaded with things like rocks and then can be used to solve puzzles by hitting  doors and levers or spikes and pieces of glass so that you can hit and defeat the ghosts. Some inventory based puzzles as well which are fairly obvious. Not much to find exploring rather than some notes in shelves and  some piano sheets. You can move around by using an old yellow car...\n+ Quite a long game, took me over 10 hours to complete.\n\n- I have seen  better looking games using unity engine (and many worse ofcourse), but this is saved by the unique atmosphere.\n- There is some platforming involved in the gameplay, which is not as smooth as it should be. Most of the times you are not sure if you are supposed to go that way or it's a bug of the engine.\n- Could use some better explanation as far as gameplay mechanics are concerned.\n\nHighly recommended 1st person horror adventure game, for its originality and fantastic atmosphere alone. There is no comparison with those generic unity horror games , this one is an original and fresh game, with great ideas that are implemented just fine in the gameplay. Hope their next project will be funded in kickstarter, since it looks even more ambitious and polished than sylvio.","February 15","true","16.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Almost everything fun about it is counteracted by something else which is no fun at all.\n\nFinding and recording the voices of the dead -> wandering aimlessly in the dark without any navigational tools, waving a microphone around, for hours.\n\nGhost-busting shenanigans -> Getting ambushed by black blobs coming through the walls or ceiling with little warning, and no real challenge to fighting them if you can just engage them from a distance.\n\nMysterious supernatural plot -> puzzles that are almost solved for you thanks to map markers showing items of significance, coupled with a few very uninuitive uses of a gas-powered blunderbuss.\n\nThen are are a few things I just don't like at all - too much of the game's actual story is entirely missable, hidden behind little documents on bookshelves or tape reels left in random locations. The textures are bad enough that I usually have to determine what objects are by shape alone. Despite the huge number of collectible items, backtracking is not possible for most of the game. The game's save system is only semi-functional: it only autosaves, but it doesn't keep track of your physical location on a game map or what triggers you have hit already and sometimes loses Voices you have collected. Artificial fog and a red filter make it hard to see where you're going. The environment is bleak, but not really scary or unsettling. Death-by-ghost has no meaningful consequences, so they're not scary so much as they are annoying. Problems, problems, problems!\n\nBeyond the novelty of using a tape recorder to play spooky noises backwards and slowed down, I don't think there is a thing about this game that would make me recommend it to others. It's not the worst horror game I've played, but it just isn't interesting enough to overcome its flaws.","January 7","false","14.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It does things in a very unique and interesting way and it all boils down to the fact, that the game is all centered around the EVP - Electronic Voice Phenomena. If you were every interested in any paranormal things you might understand that no matter how unscientific and disproven this is, it can still be a thrilling theme to explore. Hence the popularity of the topic not only in classic horror movies, but in modern ones as well. Yet, surprisingly, not a single game (to my knowledge) before Sylvio has dedicated itself fully to it.\n\nYour main tool in this game is your is a reel-to-reel tape recorder that can play recorded audio at different speeds forwards or backwards. Which is important, because the voices you will hear in the dark can be speaking not "normally", but slowly and backwards, for example. It's a simple enough puzzle gimmick and not hard to master, but it creates a genuine sense of mystery and thrill, when you're recording some long died kid's voice in the middle of nowhere and suddenly in the same recording you hear a different voice say backwards "he's mine". It's such a simple yet effective way to tell a story - in short disjointed messages you record and decipher, - and to build an atmosphere that it doesn't get old until the end of the game.\n\nWhat does get a bit old is "hunting ghosts" - angry black clouds and human silhouettes, - with a weird rifle you find early in the game, that shoots blunt objects to solve simple physics puzzles and sharp objects to pacify the aforementioned ghosts. It starts surprising and creepy, but later becomes a simple routine as you can't actually die or lose meaningful progress in the game and these black ghosts are very much finite per level, as each one leaves a message to decipher. The rifle ammo and pressure management becomes pretty annoying in later levels too, one funfair-themed one in particular long overstays its welcome and relies heavily on using the rifle in a very unfun way.\n\nIn addition, the game can be quite buggy. The hub-map you revisit between levels, for example, is traversed with a car and that car can behave abnormally or you can exit it and suddenly ploish through the floor, which sometimes spawns you above the level, but sometimes doesn't and you have to restart the game (it does save all the things you've completed but you always start near the beginning of the level). It's a pretty ugly looking game as well, despite the Remastered version upping the looks. And the menu is very lacking in settings, while the help & controls option is just a huge image file you need to scroll, with no rebindable keys to speak of.\n\nAll in all, the game could've used a bigger budget upgrade with few levels and puzzles rethought and a switch to a fully open interconnected world Vanishing of Ethan Carter-like. But, we don't have that yet. What we have is a very exciting, atmospheric game with fantastic 80s horror synth soundtrack and unique mechanics. It's unforgettable and fun, despite it's shortcomings and honestly muddled ending, and I fully recommend people trying it out.\n\nP.S. Is it a weird coincidence, that the game has a logo similar to Aphex Twin's, who released a new LP called "Syro" in 2014? Great record, by the way.\n\nP.P.S.

The graphics are ugly as hell, but the audio design is the real star here; a fabulously moody soundtrack combined with a clever sound-scrubbing minigame makes for quite an impressive atmosphere.\n\nAll in all this is one of the most relaxing horror-themed games I've ever played. There are no jump scares to speak of; early on you receive a homemade gas-powered shotgun that can be used to remove obstacles including a few types of ghostly entities that I won't spoil. The fear comes mostly from capitalizing on the sensation of being stuck in the forest in the middle of the night with no choice but to delve deeper into a disturbing mystery, at which Sylvio excels.\n\nMy only gripe would be that some of the detective work required is sadistically specific. You need to analyze EVP to receive waypoints for integral objects in the game-world, which means you'll spend most of the game wandering around with your microphone out performing seances and listening for voices in the static. That's fine, but only seances and boss fights receive a bearing from your microphone; the majority of audio clues are masked in clouds of "orbs" scattered around the enormous maps. Most of the time these clouds are gathered around logical markers like ruined playground equipment or the wrecks of cars, but many are located in completely non-intuitive, out-of-the-way places that are frustratingly easy to miss, meaning often you'll be moving on to a new area without a 100% completion rate.\n\nThis is a problem because in order to get the "good" ending you have to capture every scrap of evidence in the game. Considering there are absolutely NO walkthroughs of this game online, this is next to impossible, and the "standard" ending is highly anti-climactic, to say the least.\n\nRegardless, this is one of the most unique gaming experiences I've ever had, and I loved practically every second of it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/362860/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","In Sylvio, you are Juliette Waters, a woman who is fascinated with Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP). While wandering an abandoned family fun park, she attempts to unravel the mystery of what happened, and seeks the souls that still reside there. Originally released in 2015, the game recently gained a remastered update for the Unity 5 engine.\n\nI've been waiting to buy this title for a while now, and so I thought that the most recent 50% off sale was a good time to pick it up. The unique idea behind Sylvio, where you attempt to communicate with spirits with an EVP microphone in particularly, appealed to me as it's a concept I have not seen before. Unfortunately, I feel that the game severely lacks direction in the beginning, which caused me to lose all interest almost immediately.\n\nYou start out wandering aimlessly around the park, with no sense of direction or what you are supposed to do. Eventually, I'm not sure if it's a timed event or a certain tile that you need to walk on, you will fall through the ground into a basement where you become trapped. You must find your way out, and in doing so you're led to a garage where the first puzzle lies in wait. Out of nowhere, I fell over and came back to a checkpoint. Confused, I proceeded back to the place where I last was and found out that some big black "smoke monster", that looks like it came straight out of Lost, was headed for me. I grabbed my potato launcher and attempted to shoot it, I tried to use my microphone on it, and for about 15 minutes I kept repeatedly "dying"; which is just a fancy term in this game for falling over and restarting at a certain location.\n\nI became frustrated, especially when I managed to somehow get the monster to go away, only to have it return a few seconds later, so I quit the game. It also doesn't help that the controls are completely convoluted, and there's absolutely zero in-game tutorial to help you get used to them. On top of this, there was hardly any background music or ambiance, leaving my experience very empty and rather boring; I honestly felt no compelling reason to continue playing Sylvio beyond the first half an hour.\n\nIt's rare that I will write a review for a game that I have not finished, but Sylvio really lacks anything substantial within the first 30 minutes of its existence. This is an important time frame, where it's usually make or break for most players. Unfortunately, it's break for me. Perhaps if the game had more direction prior to branching off into an open world EVP/Ghost Hunting game it would've fared better, but I've seen in other reviews that most latter parts of the game are spent needlessly wandering around also. I've actually refunded this title, I think I'll go for DreadOut: KotD instead.\n\nRating: 2.0/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","May 8","false","0.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","1"

This lead to me being stuck for an obscene amount of time on certain levels.\n\nThe atmosphere is incredibly well done in Slyvio. The game gave me the chills and was able to instill fear in me whenever static came through--who knew black blobs could be so terrifying?\n\nI loved the premise of Sylvio, but I found the execution of the story to be lacking and the ending to be incredibly anti-climactic. All of this amazing buildup with no pay off in the end. With that said, I still would recommend Sylvio as it is a game worth playing--especially if you like indie horror games.","July 20, 2015","true","14.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The sound recorder was a game mechanic I hadn’t seen done before and it is a very interesting idea.\n\nSadly though, the entire game is poorly executed.\n\nFirst there is the controls. ‘C’ for flashlight, really? There’s no crouching, no sprinting. For some reason the scroll wheel turns the character left and right, jumping is inconsistent. It was incredibly frustrating when I needed to jump on a stack of sewer pipes to get to another area. The stack is right on the edge of the jump height, so if you don’t jump from exactly the right place you can’t get on the stack. Queue five minutes of trying to find just the right spot to jump from.\n\nThere’s also no cursor on the main menu for some reason, forcing you to navigate it with the arrow keys. There is on the settings menu though, just not the main one, giving me the impression the dev was just too lazy to use clickable buttons on the main menu.\n\nAll in all, from the controls my impression was it was a very bad port of an old PS2 game and the graphics are in line with this. So I was surprised to find out it is not a port, it was developed for PC on the Unity engine.\n\nThen there’s the gameplay itself. The little jumpscares are predictable and not particularly scary, the atmosphere is kind of meh. Maybe I’ve just been desensitized too much, but I didn’t find it scary in the least.\n\nThe tutorial screens are also annoying as hell, covering 3/4 of the screen and they displayed the same thing repeatedly with no way to turn them off.\n\nThe flashlight is also useless, as it doesn’t even light up the dark areas. You might expect a dark corner to become visible when you shine a light at it, but it doesn’t, it remains dark no matter what.","November 1, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

One of these concepts is explored in the game Sylvio, Kickstarter-funded and Greenlit by the Steam community, and is published and developed by Apostrophe. Being a horror game, especially one in first person which appears to be a rising trend in recent years thanks to Amnesia and Outlast, Sylvio has quite a lot to live up to, and it has a similar tone and atmosphere to the aforementioned games. In many ways, Sylvio succeeds in differentiating itself from the pack, but a few shortcomings prevent it from being the shining star it could have been.\n\nTechnically speaking, Sylvio isn't very polished. It's actually quite buggy at times, and while that is to be expected with games, no game is perfect after all, some of the bugs in the game can completely wreck the mood that the game is tiring so hard to set. Things like items clipping through the floor, getting stuck in random places and having to restart from the beginning of the sequence again. Building up tension is fine, but there's nothing worse than having to turn off the game because it freezes or something happens and you have to start from a point way back because of technical issues rather than your own failings.  Especially when the game itself has such a great concept and you have to muscle through it because of technical issues.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","June 25, 2015","false","5.8"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","0"

I've also found one very frustrating thing that I'd like to see fixed, but I guess that depends how deeply it's embeded into the game.\n\nThe game has a very dark atmsophere, something similar to Silent Hill, but not near as gruesome. It's not really scarey in that I've only really been surprised once, but it does have a very suspensful tone to it. I am playing with an xBox 360 controller and that works really well. It only took me a short time to get the hang of playing the game. I'm stuck right now in an area where I know how to advance, but it's a timed thing and I just keep missing the jumps at the right time to move on.  While I can deal with that part of the game, although I don't like it, it's one place where the one fault I've found comes into play...you can't save the game where you want.  Personally I find this totally unacceptable. The game auto saves betwen "chapters". The issue I am having now is that after playing through the level and making spending time listening to the recordings and having a seance and figuring out what's next, I get to this one part that is a fairly hard "puzzle".  After a bit of trying and trying again, I get frustrated and quit.  The issue is that the next time I come into the game I have to play the entire level over again.\n\nReally guys, how hard is it to program in a manual game save or at least incorporate an auto-save every few minutes or after reaching some save point?\n\n\nI'm addding to this review as the programmers have added somewhat of a saved game feature... thanx for doing that. Having said that the game still does have a couple of issues. The save game feature supposedly saves as you go along. So I tested that the other day. I started my current level over again and played through it for 10 minutes or so and then left the game.  Then later I went back into the game and it had sorted of saved the game. The game remembered that I had gone through the level in that things I had opened were already opened and things I had picked up were in my inventory.  I did have to "physically" begin at the start of the level again, but all I had to do was to walk thru to where I had stopped the last time.  At least I didn't have to gather and open and listen for things I'd already done that to previously. I do wish I could still say to save at this point and when I restart the game be taken to that same point, but this is definitely an improvement.\n\nI did run into something that was very frustrating. I had been playing this level for a bit and was kind of stuck. I went into the settings... just to refresh myself as to what they were. While trying to exit the settings using the xBOX 360 controller, some button I pressed started me into a new game.  There was no waring that this was about to happen and when I got back into the game I double-checked the help file for the controller controls and no button should start a new game. So I had to play the game again from the start.  I was not happy about that, but fortuantely I wasn't very far in the game and I quickly caught back up to the place I'd been about an hour earlier. The only thing I can thnik of was that perhaps I'd pressed the button to take me to the menu and the top item in the menu is to do a new game, but the only thing I saw on the screen was the settings screen.\n\nI still give the game a thumbs-up as I think it has great potential, but these little frustrattions tend to color my opnion in the other direction.  If I could give it a 1-10 rating with 10 being excellent, I'd give it a 7 or 8.","June 13, 2015","true","33.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","2"

This is not a game of jump scares, so don't expect to see it on the youtube channels of those who make a living off squealing at games. Instead it is a slow burn as your character explores an abandoned tourist attraction trying to find the solution to a decades old mystery. The atmosphere is one of tragedy and oppressive decay rather than outright horror.\n\nThe mystery is compelling and draws you in as you go from ghost to ghost, seance to seance, attempting to uncover just what happened to the people here and the circumstances of their downfall. The presentation is quite basic, the game was developed by a very small indie team, but the unique ghost recording gameplay carries the day and presentation aside, the game has a lot of atmosphere.\n\nThe game will keep you playing to the end in order to solve the mystery and there lies my greatest gripe, I really did not enjoy the ending. It is ambigious to a fault with no sense of closure whatsoever. There are extremely vague clues as to what the ending might mean but all of it is really up to speculation, and not in that good way you can chew over, as there simply isn'tt enough meat to chew on. I actually had to wait before writing this review or it would have been a not recommended, but once I had a breather I realsied that ending aside, the ghost recording mechanic had been enough to carry me through 12 hours of gameplay to the game end. That alone means it did enough right to warrant a thumbs up from me. There are pieces of piano pages you can collect throughout the game, I had all but one when the credits rolled. Perhaps if you had them all a better ending materializes?\n\nPros:\nNovel ghost recording gameplay mechanic as the central driving force\nGood atmosphere\nThe desire to solve the mystery is compelling\n\nCons:\nPresentation shows its indie roots and limited budget\nUnsatisfying conclusion\n\nOverall this is worth a shot if you are after something different and the develloper deserves credit for exploring something new.\n\n7/10","October 11, 2015","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the one hand, there's a lot not to like - the game has some serious lack of polish, with many terrain objects without collision boxes, a -very- lackluster vehicle level which you have to play through repeatedly, the graphics in itself really are nothing to write home about,  The gameplay not particularly varied, and I was kind of disappointed to see that most of the game takes place in large, open areas rather than in the confined spaces you see in the first level.\n\nOn the other side, Sylvio does one thing right: Atmosphere, and especially sound design. The EVPs sound just as you would expect to hear them in classical horror movies, and as you want to find as many EVP fragments as possible, you'll constantly run around with the micro out - which means that your ears will be filled with the noise of static and various creepy background noises. These alone often suffice to keep you on the edge of your seat as you walk through the game's dark forests, but it can become absolutely terrifying when you turn around and suddenly get a strong signal, signifying that a hostile ghost in closing in on you.\n\nThat being said: Sylvio's atmosphere may be very good, but I'm fairly certain many people will be disappointed by the game because of its many issues when it comes to polish and overall gameplay.  Thus, I can only recommend the game to a limited extend and recommend playing the demo to see whether or not the game hits your strings.","January 3","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
