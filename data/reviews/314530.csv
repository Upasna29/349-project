In "Games Info" - there is info about future features of the game! No skills, houses, single player at this moment. Only Multiplayer with "Plane Crash"\n\nGame has a potencial! It`s in a "very early access", so if you dont want to help devs to make this game better - DONT BUY IT. If you are ready to give your ideas/bug reports - welcome!I had some problems at the begining but 2 hrs later I found how to craft, how to weld.. At this moment there is a problem with fuel but devs should fix it soon. Should be funny to play with crowd.\n\nNow you have:\n-only multiplayer on island with quest "get all parts of the plane faster and fly away"\n\nCraft (this items I found, but may be you can craft something else):\n- blowpipe\n-3 types of arrows for it\n\nActions:\n-you can eat berries or mushrooms\n-drink from lake or special trough\n-poison lakes\n-kick someone with a stone (fist, axe, pickaxe..)\n-place a bear trap\n-fire from blowpipe\n\nI will update this review after patches","March 19, 2015","true","3.6"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","24","31","2","0"

If you have 11 Euros and don't know how to waste them in the most useless way, buy this game.\nThere's no survival, except for the boredom you have to overcome to play this more than 10 minutes.\nTheres literally nothing to do in this game, besides collecting parts that are all over the place and are found within 5 minutes. then you have to search for the weilding table, connect the wing parts, install them onto the plane and yep -> you're done with this game.\nIn this state of devopment it's clearly a nope and looking at the concept of this game I don't expect more to come.\n\nThere's not even a day/night cycle, of you haven*t eaten a long time and your food-meter is down, you fully recover from one banana and so on. Save your money on this game and give it to charity or the local animal shelter.\n\n","March 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","20","25","3","2"

Why on earth would you want to play this?  Run around in a multiplayer that doesnt and wont work properly.  It took a while to understand that only multiplayer works.  All the intro option screens dont do anything.  Once playing you collect airplane parts in your backpack which gets too full after picking up a few items.  You hunt down the items in this bad game, dont waste your time or money!","July 9, 2015","false","1.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Have reinstalled 3-4 times and nothing.  Posted on the forums and nothing about how to fix this yet and nothing from the devs yet either.\nWill be sure to update this once/if it is fixed, but figure to warn others first hand.\nAdd on to review.
