"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varkson/recommended/340320/","varkson","Varkson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varkson/","73 products in account","Sinless is a cyberpunk point and click adventure game, and manages to be dizzyingly beautiful and an aural treat, dragged down by everything else. This is part one of a three part trilogy, and unfortunetly there is no satisfying conclusion yet. The story isn't terribly interesting and unfortunetly filled full of contemporary video game references. It feels cheap and I can't say I really care for the developer's taste in games. The characters are pretty much stock standard and the dialogue is just ok. It really just doesn't bring any interesting ideas to the table, it's mostly full of tropes. I could excuse this if there was a philosophical theme, but this doesn't really happen, the game takes a more action approach and prefers to dazzle with it's atmosphere.\n\nWhere the game truly shines is it's ability to create an immersive environment. This is a game you want to wear headphones with, the music and sound effects really bring you into the world. The visual design is quite unique and uses massive amounts of lens flair and bloom on the lighting, as well as blurring and pixilating everything. And it works well. If you take a close look, it looks like quite a lot of the assets are actually photographs put through a filter. I'd consider this a cheap way for the developers to create assets, but it works fine for most of the part. The asthetic is something resembling Deus Ex: Human Revolution if it were set in Japan. It's not 80's cyberpunk, but it still has a lot of the Asian influence. The game also delivers on the classic bleak rain, neon lights, dark alleys, illict augs and a lot of drugs. It's used somewhat sparingly and works well in the games context.\n\nHowever, I had quite a lot of difficulty navigating through the city. Unfortunetly, the visual design doesn't lend itself to guiding the player well. Unless you take note of everything on the screen, you may find yourself not knowing how to continue.  I'm fine with a bit of exploration, but it's never clear exactly where you can go. I also found it easy to miss dialogue options, as the section requires you to click and drag to scroll and will often add new options without marking or otherwise bringing them to your attention. Like most players, I go from top to bottom in the dialogue list, but I've seen cases where the options are added above your last clicked dialogue option, making it a little confusing.\n\nAs of the first release, there are a number of issues with graphics failing to load, leaving you with a black screen or only part of the scene. At this point, the only thing to do is to reset. Luckily, the game will always bring you back to where you are, so it's not a big deal, but still an annoyance. I expect this will be patched fairly quickly.\n\nAlthough Sinless fails on many fronts, I feel it's definetely worth the small amount of money, just to experience the atomosphere.  I got around 2 hours of playtime out of it, and I'm quite happy with the game and am anticipating the second part.","December 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","0"

Nor is it enjoyable.\n\nIt uses so many generic elements that it feels like no more than a throwup of uninteresting and overused tropes. I don't see what I'm supposed to appreciate about Sinless. The setting is probably one of the most cliche dystopian settings, in which government uses 'chips' to control minds, yada.\n\nVisuals look nice from the screenshots, but holy damn do they go overboard with the lighting-- often to the point that you can't even see what's going on.\n\nCharacters are generally flat, boring, and uninteresting. No presence of tone, word choice, or personality differentation between characters. Conversation and dialogue may as well have been done by robots, seeing how generic and one-dimensional every single character happens to be. Seriously, they might as well all just be the same person. I wouldn't know. Even with 'dialogue choices', everything you can talk about simply bores you to tears.\n\nSave your money. Go try something with an original concept and actual cyberpunk flair like Gemini Rue.  This isn't worth it.","December 16, 2015","false","0.3"," 35 of 59 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","35","59","5","0"

Where the hell am I?". Those questions will circle around in your own mind as you descend, only to re-emerge at the top until eventually, a mysterious creature offers you a strange blue substance for tasting. As you oblige, reality warps around you and your adventure begins ...\n\nSinless is set in a utopian World which wants to distance itself completely from the now-bygone, "primitive" AD era. Due to catastrophic flooding, civilzation was forced to build it's habitation upwards, simultaneously diving the population geographically and caste-wise into lower, middle and upper classes. All citizens interface with scheduled programs through ports on their augmented bodies. These "progs" dictate what activites are acceptable on any given day. Anything else is considered a deviation from the "prog" and results in immediate punishment.\nThe omnipresent 'OmniCare' is the megacorporation pulling the strings, insisting it's all for the public good; a mandatory ruleset that eliminates anti-social behaviour, resulting in a healthy, happy populace. A world without sin ...\n\nSinless has a strong sense of it's own aesthetic style and it's a pretty unique one: predominantly dark backdrops are flooded with neon-like bloom/lens flare lighting effects from the red/pink area of the color spectrum, corners and objects are semi-obscured with blurring or pixelization and characters are animated in a very minimalist, odd, entrancing way. It's a style that always leaves something to the imagination which really helps to immerse the player in the cyberpunk world that MGP studios have created.\n\nGameplay is essentially a visual novel with point 'n' click elements. Making the wrong decision or provoking the warth of the law can result in a 'Game Over' screen, but it's fun to discover the many ways you can end your character's existence. Interactivy is relatively limited: your standard "examine/look" and "use" actions are the staple here once again and there is no great deal of exploration or sidequests to be had. 2 mini-games and 2 instances of a puzzle are decent little bonuses.\n\nSecond to the unique presentation, sound and music is where Sinless really shines. The game comes with the OST included, which for many would probably be worth the price alone. Headphones are definitely recommended here (as advised by the developers) to experience the heavy electronic score. Most impressively, the intensity of the tracks increases as cetain revelations and milestones occur on-screen. It's a perfect compliment to the visuals and the combination of the two enhances the immersive experience.\n\nThe story is not particularly deep and influences from popular science fiction are evident. Little or no connection is made between any of the characters and most of what they have to say is strictly related to your progression through the story. There are however some interesting observations and theories relayed by a few of the seeminly inconsequential characters. At the same time, a strong argument could be made to explain this pervading, distant behaviour as a plot device. I suspect a clearer picutre will be painted in part 2, which I'm very much looking forward to.","December 22, 2015","true","5.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If anyone remembers the old Cryo Interactive adventure Dune, this game has a very similar feel to it. You move from static screen to static screen, engage in dialog and occasionally look at objects or scenery. Much like Dune, both the graphics and music are absolutely terrific. The art direction really lifts this game up; the stylized cyberpunk vibe is fabulously well-realized. On the down side: i don't mind the familiar plot, but the dialog is a big problem - the characters lack depth and personality, and do too much exposition. And, well, the pixel hunting is painful. There aren't many puzzles in the game, but you will spend a lot of time mousing over everything just trying to find out where the exits are. If it wasn't so beautiful, i would probably give it a thumbs down, but the aesthetic is right on the money, so if you're a fan of cyberpunk i'd definitely recommend giving this a look.","March 5","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
