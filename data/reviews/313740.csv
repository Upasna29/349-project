"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Macdaddy00/recommended/313740/","Macdaddy00","Crallium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Macdaddy00/","198 products in account",""Like Skyrim with Fox Girls." - IGN, 10/10\n\n"Easily the pinnacle of gaming." - GameSpot, 10/10\n\n"What the hell are you playing?" - My roommate who walked in on me playing Sakura Spirit, 11/10\n\nSakura Spirit is a post-modern Japanese visual novel with story elements and plot points inspired by other famous visual novels like the Clannad and Steins;Gate visual novels, as well as classics such as Katawa Shoujo and G-senjou no Maou. The riveting story is supported by emotionally engaging characters such as rising Judo star Gushiken Takahiro, our main protagonist, on a quest to bring honor to Japan by winning an upcoming Judo competition (as Judo is the most popular sport known to man, so winning this competition would prove Japan victors of the world). His friends and family, having no faith in the spirit of Japan himself, mostly because the main character is a giant nerd, tell him he should pray at a magical temple to give him good luck.\n\nWith directions given to him by a female Judo teacher he watches bathe because he's an unlikable pervert (this is okay, because this perversion gives the character more depth the only depth he gets in the entire game), he walks into a mystical forest, only to find an abandoned, but well kept traditional Japanese shrine. Walking inside, he begins to pray, but not after long, he hears a woman talking in his ear. He gets dizzy and falls to the floor, but not before getting a glimpse of this figure, who appears to be a succubus! All of a sudden, it's clear! The Americans tricked him into going to this shrine to sacrifice himself to Satan unwillingly! It was all a clever ploy to get Japan out of the running for the Judo competition!\n\nI wont ruin the rest of the story, but the essentials are that he meets some fair-♥♥♥ maidens who are total ♥♥♥♥♥, but then he meets some that are like, fox girls, or something. And the fox girl in blue is my waifu, so I'm just gonna put it out there, she's off-limits.\n\nThis VN has a lot of references to Western pop culture and old Japanese mythos, while retaining a feeling of being true and unique to a real life situation. It makes the player feel as if they are actually a Judo star from Japan stuck in a world full of chicks with huge boobs and almost no men to stop you from getting dat pussay. Because if there were, you'd probably be too beta and ugly to get some of that fine ♥♥♥.\n\nThis is the Boku no Pico Evangelion of visual novels.\n\n10/10, it was kinda ♥♥♥♥, but I got a new waifu, so I'm definitely not regreting the $7.49 I paid for this.","July 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 2,846 of 3,220 people (88%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","88","846","3","15","53"

Uhh, the red one lost her parents, and that makes her sad sometimes, the black girl is a tsundere, and the furry babes...nothing, literally nothing can be said about them.\n\nOkay, what about the music? The music? I think there are only 2 tracks in this whole game, they are called generic battle music, and generic elevator music.\n\nSo, is there even a reason to buy the game?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/recommended/313740/","PhyreMatrix","PhyreMatrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhyreMatrix/","941 products in account","I've played a few visual novels. Most of them have either the ability to make different choices or an exceptional story. This game however has neither. Granted this game gives you a couple boob and semi-nude shots, which is exactly what you would think you'd be getting from the screenshots. If you want to watch some pics of half naked women you'd find more enjoyment in a hentai or some random anime. It's 2014 stuff like that is easily accessible for less with some patience and a decent internet connection. Or if you want to play an actual game there's plenty of nudity in something like The Witcher. And that game leaves nothing to the imagination.\n\nAnyways, cheap nudity and soft cornpron aside there's very little substance to this VN. And I say that because there's barely any character development. It's a short piece of what is to be a series. Although in the three or so hours playing it I didn't feel any vested interest in the characters. I didn't even care about who our main character was going to choose in terms of a lover. The Tenchi Muyo formula is nice. It's one of my favorite anime series but this story felt like a hollow shell of it. And despite it being a series if the first chapter doesn't grab you you're not going to want to read the next one.\n\nIf you're looking for semi decent VNs on Steam consider one of Winter Wolves or a Hanako title. This title, unless you're starved for overpriced fanservice you should probably pass on it.\n\n","October 20, 2014","false","4.5"," 606 of 772 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","606","772","10","18"

There is *spoilers* only 1 choice to be made, and the story doesn't branch too differently whether you choose one or the other.\n\nThe art is pretty good, but the story is super standard, there is no meaningul drama and characters aren't very fleshed out, it's also not the best writing out there, without taking into account the typos here and there. Pretty much like many Type B anime series out there at the moment. But if that is your thing however, then this is for you. The novel is pretty short and all of the 'content' worth paying for is already leaked out in the Community Hub for this game, so take a look at that before wasting money on this.\n\nTo be honest there are much better visual novels on Steam already. Like Narcissu, and that one is free. Go ahead and play that.\n\nThat said, support all kinds of Visual Novels on Steam, for great justice.","July 9, 2014","true","3.5"," 247 of 314 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","247","314","0","6"

The situations are very funny and sometimes so absurd that you can't not laugh. But and that is the point you have to know, its like you read a book or a manga or something else. A visual novel isn't a "real" game where you can interact with your environment. You get some beautiful wallpapers from those girls that show you the current situation. But that's all. You have only one decision in the whole game and the story ends always equal! So i only recommend it if you like to read, are interested in an unusual funny story and see some great wallpapers with some ecchi. Otherwise i can't recommend this visual novel for you.\n\nIs it porn?\nNo, it isn't porn (or hentai), but and that is fact, it includes some nudity and some sexual allusions but you'll get to see anything. There is always something in the way, so it's skillfully censored, which is completely normal for this type of representation (called Ecchi). Don't buy the game, if you only want to see boobs!\n\nTo bring bring it to the point: funny visual novel with sexy girls. 6/10\n\nIn summary:\nPro        Contra                + funny story        - only one selectable decision                + absurd situations        - maybe a bit short                + nice wallpapers        - no voice acting                + sexy girls        - price is a bit to high\n\nPS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point.

The next morning I woke up and put on my leaf village headband and kawaii (Cute) pikachu backpack and headed to school. The ignorant westerners there make fun of me for loving superior japanese culture but they dont understand true culture. After school I headed to anime class where we discussed our favourite things about Nippon (I'm the most popular boy in anime club.) After going home I opened up my Steamu (Steam) Library and got ready to play some gamesu (Games) when I noticed that I had recieved a gift from Nick-Kun. It was this game, Sakura Spirit. I was excited to finally play a game not made by the baka gaijin (Idiot foreigner) game devs. (I'm white but Im Trans-Japanese and have carried a katana since I was 7). I opened the game and was immediately in love with the accurate representation of Nippon culture. I have always lamented living in Canada and not being able to go into the forest and find fox and slime girls but in this game I can live my dreams before I move to Nippon (I am going to win a katana/pokemon cards competition to earn the money to move.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peroxicide/recommended/313740/","peroxicide","peroxicide","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peroxicide/","266 products in account","So I played this game out of morbid curiosity. ♥♥♥♥ it, why not, right? Everything said about it is right: the story is nothing, the music is godawful, the art is so limited and dull that you're nearly falling asleep. There's one whole choice 80% of the way through which affects nothing. Every single girl is practically humping the protagonist's leg (because they either love creepy strangers with no personality or he is literally the only male their age they've ever met).\n\nBut what gets me is the ♥♥♥♥ing judo tournament.\n\nRight at the start, protag is like HEY I'M TAKAHIRO, I'M NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BIG JUDO TOURNAMENT. If he gets it, bam, scholarship, he can start competing on an international level and make his career. He goes to pray at this shrine for luck in the tournament, and then time travel ♥♥♥♥ happens and we're in the past/alternate dimension/who cares.\n\nThe whole time, he's going "I have to get back for my judo tournament! Everything's riding on this tournament! I've gotta go home and fight in my judo tournament!" Further shenanigans happen and the same demon-girl who transported you there initially is like\nOKAY BRO\nPORTAL'S OPEN BUT ONLY FOR TWO MINUTES\nIDK WHY, NO TIME TO SAY GOODBYE\nIT'LL INCREASE THE DRAMA IF YOU DON'T SAY GOODBYE NOW SHUT UP AND GO\n\nSo he goes back home and handily wins the judo tournament. A rising star in the field, he gains some level of fame and earns a scholarship to the school he wants. Everything he came back for, right? It'd be totally stupid if he were to, say, immediately throw away everything he came back for and go to the shrine and yell for two months, trying to go back to the other world.\n\nOh waaaaaait.\n\nWhy the ♥♥♥♥ did you even go back if you were going to invalidate the only reason you had to go back, Takahiro? You showed up, did the thing, and your yell of THE TOURNAMENT immediately turns to GOTTA RETURN TO THE PAST-FUTURE!!\n\nThe rest of this game was some seriously amateur nonsense. That massive inconsistency on the main character's only motivation, though...that one really got me.\n\nJust watch the Game Grumps playthrough instead.","January 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 84 of 114 people (74%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","74","84","114","15","5"

But I do not recommend this visual novel reason can be found below.\n\nThe StoryTake on the role of a Rising Judo Star Gushiken Takahiro was two weeks away from the match that would make or break his career -- a championship match where the winner is then signed up to be a young national athlete for Japan.\n\nHe's prepared and ready, but that doesn’t stop him from being nervous about his upcoming battle. At the suggestion of his friends and classmates, he goes to a shrine that is rumoured to grant any wish or prayer. He pours all the coins from his already full coin bank into the offering box and says his prayer. After praying, he becomes dizzy and nauseous and eventually faints. When he wakes up, he finds himself in an ancient, unfamiliar place.\n\nWhile searching for a way back to his village, he stumbles upon two girl wielding swords chasing after two… foxgirls.\n\nMusic and ArtstyleMusic feels average at best nothing too fancy here, But for the artstlye it is honestly very good as much I hate to say this I enjoyed the overall artstyle of this Visual Novel the CG scenes are good making good use of smooth colors.\n\nReasons for not recommending this Visual NovelThe story is very generic, when I first read this visual novel I felt bored very bored because its generic and predictable. Some guy got tranported into another world and then gets into some nice situation where everytime he opens a door there will be a half naked girl in it and then he needs to find a way back to his original home and a great miracle happend he got sent back. (sounds familiar? Probably yes because this type of storyline can be found in everywhere)\n\nThe artstyle of the sprites for certain chracther I think the chracther name was slime (I think) those 4 chracthers were so lazily made all of them have the same chracther model and the only difference is the eye colour, and the colour of the slime covering their body, other than that all is good.\n\nThe fansercvice, while playing through this visual novel you are literally being slapped in the face with boobs every 15 minutes, this just shows that they are using fanservice to cover up their bad and generic story.\n\nTo sum upNo i do not recommend getting this game at all unless you are a sakura series fan or just want a story that slaps you in the face with boobs every 10 minutes in a attempt to cover up their bad plot/story.","December 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 291 of 449 people (65%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","65","291","449","61","0"

Or probably thinking - I don't judge if you're not thinking what I came into this pretty sure you were thinking.\n\nAnyway.\n\nHere is my delicate render of what I believe is/was in your thoughts, upon seeing this game: 'Wow. Those are some big ♥♥♥♥in' tiddies. Wait a second, this isn't even a game, it's just another fanservicey virtual novel thing.'\n\nAnd... you'd be pretty correct. Firstly, those are indeed some big ♥♥♥♥in' tiddies. Secondly, this is a visual novel. Which is cool. If virtual novels aren't your thing, then I don't think this is the game for you because you're probably looking for a game that's a game and not a visual novel. Which, again, is cool. But if you happen to be the visual novel type of person, then read on. If not, go try reading a (non-virtual) book! I recommend White Fang by Jack London.\n\nAnyway, if you're the visual novel type of person, then that's great. This game has got a lot of good things going for it, fanservice aside. Even if you don't like fanservice, well, bear with me.\n\nThe art is nice. Sometimes I draw things, sometimes I draw things for cash. Although I am far from one who can be considered the 'best' authority on all things visual art-related, I'd like to think this comment carries some weight, as little as that may be. The art style is very cute, obviously very anime. There isn't a ton of variation in terms of body language (to go with the different expressions), but this is the norm with visual novels, iirc.\n\nThe characters are ♥♥♥♥ing adorable. Though I guess it's possible they're a little tropey (I'm no expert), I personally like them. The game isn't extremely long, so yeah, there could've been more character development. But I definitely got attached enough to the girls by the end of it, meaning somebody (or several somebodies) did their job right. The character you play in the PoV of is probably the least developed, but I assume this is for the whole 'stepping into his shoes' thing, even if I'm not a male.\n\nAnd the story. Oh, man. I admit, when I went into this... it was jokingly. It was to be an ironic little playthrough, maybe some card farming as I went. That kinda thing. I didn't expect to like it much more than a shrug and 'it was okay, I guess' thumbs up. Maybe accompanied by a 'meh' noncommital hand wiggle. I honestly started playing/reading with low expectations. Like yeah, I can see the art's good, but that doesn't mean jack ♥♥♥♥ unless the writing's good, or at least good enough. You see people complaining about the simplicity of cartoons these days? Yeah, well it ain't just the visuals that make cartoons good, man. Writing matters, too. Otherwise the haters would be watching silent, uncaptioned animations all day (not that I'm judging anyone who does). But I digress.\n\nI didn't expect this to be spectacular in any way whatsoever. I didn't expect to be wowed. None of that. I've only heard of this game as being good for tiddies, card farming, and jokes. No more than that.\n\nBut... then I played through it. I didn't finish the story on my first go. I actually tried reading it out to a Skype call, which was amusing, to say the least. The session I finished the game, I am not lying to you when I say I almost ♥♥♥♥ing cried. Or maybe I actually did cry, I don't remember. Point is, I got real emotional. Probably more than I needed to, if we're gonna be honest here.\n\nI personally wasn't disappointed. So yeah, I'd give it - at the very least - a thumbs up. Minus sarcastic shrug, to boot!\n\ntl;dr: Good visuals, good story, good fanservice ('good' if you actually like fanservice though), 'idk how to close the game pls help' is the best ♥♥♥♥ing review that will EVER exist of this game. Wasn't disappointed. Buy it for yourself if you can afford it.\n\nAlso? Fox. Girls. Holy ♥♥♥♥, fox girls, bruh. If that doesn't convince you to at least check this game out, then ♥♥♥♥ if I know what will.\n\nMachiko for life.","July 30, 2015","true","2.2"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","81","35","43","11","3"

There was also a crash in the middle of it that I had to deal with and the story got jumbled.

I will attempt to be as unbiased when writing this review. I will warn those of you that are reading this that there might be some spoilers, but seeing how I finished this game in about 2 hours-ish while trying to figure out how some of the characters sounded like when they were speaking, I don't think you'll mind as much. If you speed read I think you might be able to finish this in maybe 20 Minutes - 50 Minutes, depending on how fast you can actually read. I visited their website and it says that it is their first Original English Language Visual Novel that wil be published on Steam. I assume this just means that it is the first OELVN to make it onto Steam. Now onto the review.\n\nPeronsally, I felt that this game could've been more...\nThere is a lot of potential in this game, especially in games where it should focus mainly on the story, while giving players a choice to choose where the story goes. A visual novel by any other name.\nBut this was more of a... digital book, instead of a VN. It gave you only a single choice for the duration of the entire game, which honestly disappointed me. Not only because I only had one choice through the entirety of the game, but it had such little impact on the story that the second time I went through it to choose the other option the only thing that changed was who you went with to the festival. Everything else remained the same.\n\nThe story was somewhat generic, but I love stories.\nHowever, this story seemed to go at too fast a pace. Things were happening much too quickly and the story advanced way too fast. Situations changed from confused and nervous, to happy and perverted, to sad and somber, and then to happy and perverted again faster than flipping a coin and watching it fall on the table.\n\nIn no time at all you've already, somehow, made it through several days, and then somehow you made it through an entire week! Then suddenly you are shoved through a portal that takes you back into the world where Takahiro was originally from. No explanation as to how that portal appeared, but it did. You got shoved through it. Good job.\n\nI'm not saying that there wasn't a lot of scenarios, because there were a fair amount of scenarios. They just felt rushed in hindsight. They came in much too abruptly, and ended far too quickly, and then another scenario comes in just as abruptly as the last one did. There is no breather, no build-up, it's just one thing after another. There could have been more pauses to lengthen the story, some dry spots where the characters could get to know each other better. But they all seemed to get along pretty well in some very perverted situations.\n\nBut then the characters! The characters!\nOne of the key items to any good story is the characters! But they just don't have any... definition. Nothing to define them, nothing to make them stand out, make them more unique. They're just sort of there, with a REALLY quick and sad backstory. But even then most of the characters don't have backgrounds and the game conveniently states that they all don't remember their past. Just... kind of sounds lazy to me... I'm being honest. There's little heart-warming bonding moments between the characters. They just... kind of splash water on each other and show each other their semi-naked bodies. That's all I remember from those "Bonding" moments.\n\nThe artwork is very nice! Pretty much all I have to say on the artwork.\n\nThere were also some spelling and grammatical errors and typos.\n\nSo to reiterate,\n\n-Generic story, but I like any kind of story that can take my attention.\n-Scenes go by really fast.\n-Characters are there, but they lack definition.\n-Really short game. I got through it in about 2 and a half hours.\n-Lack of choices for a VN, therefore a lack of results and consequences.\n-More of a digital book with pretty pictures.\n\nAt the end it said something about a "prologue". I hope that they will add in new chapters for free and not make us pay for it seperately. In the end I would say the $7.49 I spent on it was worth the pictures. I know how painful it can be to draw pictures like that. Even if you know what you are doing, drawing things like those in the game is a time consuming activity. I would not say that it is worth $9.99 however.\n\nThat is my review thank you for reading this lengthy thing, but I felt that it had to be done.\nI give Sakura Spirit a 6.5/10 simply for the drawings.","July 10, 2014","false","3.7"," 50 of 71 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","50","71","0","7"

But here we go.\n\nImagine being a 17-year-old girl who's a sucker for visual novels and dating sims. Imagine having an older brother who's using that to his advantage just to see you suffer. Boom, there you go, welcome to my situation. I can already hear you saying "You're female, you wouldn't understand the pleasure of Ecchi stuff" but trust me, that's not the (only) reason why I dislike Sakura Spirit.\n\nFirst off, the story. I know it's typical for Ecchi to have alot of PLOT if you know what I mean. I don't mind it, it's typical for the genre after all. But they had a nice foundation to build up a decent story, with the spirits and the different worlds and such. In the end, they overall ♥♥♥♥ed it up and brushed over everything that was good about it.\n\nNext, the background music. Oh my god the music. I couldn't turn it off completely because the whole game would've been weirder without it, even with different music on, but I wish I had still done it. Period. I need not say more. My ears won't forgive the music for wrecking them.\n\nGameplay-wise, ♥♥♥♥ that. There's none. Even for a visual novel that amount was disappointing.\n\nThe artwork was honestly the only good thing about this game. The backgrounds were detailed and matched the scenes well and also the sprites of the characters and the different CGs were drawn in high quality. The four bachelorettes (if you can even call them that since you don't have a ♥♥♥♥ing choice of which girl you want) each had their individual looks and style which was nice. Not talking bout the personality cause that would need its own paragraph.\n\n\n1/10 - Would have fapped to this if I were a guy going through puberty\n\n(DISCLAIMER: Do not think that I took this game or this review seriously for even a split second. This is Ecchi, there's plenty of fanservice, clearly not directed towards my demographic. So who am I to judge? And also, screw you, my brother, for doing this to me)","March 31, 2015","false","2.3"," 54 of 82 people (66%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","66","54","82","22","4"

The game revolves around a group of people I could probably beat up. You take the role of rising judo star Gushiken Takahiro, a complete clown who not only ♥♥♥♥ blocks himself, but me in the process. While preparing to train in Judo, a martial art that would be really respectable if Turkish oil wrestling didn't exist. One day, Takahiro finds himself in an old temple where he prays for luck in his next big-time Judo tournament, only to find himself transported into Japan's past by a spirit who is unfortunately not my girl friend.\n\nHere he meets a quirky group of girls who are also not my girl friends. What takes place after that is a 3 hour journey that does not end in snoo snoo in any way. I can't really go into much detail without spoiling anything so I'll try to make it easy on both of us. Like the measle shot.\n\nSakura Spirit is what you call a gateway VN, it's short, easy to swallow, and kind of makes you wish Takahiro was dead. The characters are memorable and easy to look at, and the situations are goofy and I can't help but find myself smiling while sitting in my box behind Target. But at the same time it has those really awkward character traits that Japanese stories like to fall back on.\nLike I said before, Takahiro is a complete clown and I would show up at his Judo tournament covered in oil wearing a reversed thong just to show him who's the real boss of this gym.  But the other characters steal the show and make it worth the 3 hour journey.\n\nMachiko and Maeko are the poster girls of the series, fox-spirit sisters who like to seal panties from the human ladies...Dirty.\nMiyo and Narumi are two local humans who try to catch the sisters in what I hope to end in playful lesbian encounters. A man can dream, can't he?\n\nShould you read Sakura Spirit? I mean, I guess. It's cheap, you're not going to lose anything other than spare time going through it. If you can stomach Takahiro with his almost unbearable with his own self felating, cooties avoiding, cringe inducing actions, but you can ignore him and pretend that it's someone much cooler in his shoes. Like Randy Savage, or me.\n\n10/11, A group of squids is called a squad.","November 8, 2014","true","3.7"," 48 of 72 people (67%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","67","48","72","8","0"

Still, I never thought I'd ever play it, until I won a giveaway for it. So, I decided to throw away any shame I might feel about people finding out I play such games, go through it, take screenshots and write a review. Loads of fun ahead of me.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=307080033\n\nStory\nAs the main focus in a visual novel, you will want this to be good. And well... its not bad at least. You play as a student who is worried about an upcoming judo match. You find out about a shrine which is supposed to grant luck on people who pray there. Something happens and suddenly you are dealing with fox girls, tsunderes and a couple of other cuties. The rest of the story has you wanting to return home in time for the match, while going through ever more perverted events involving the girls you get to know. I enjoyed it, being much like an ecchi harem comedy in text form. This won't appeal to everyone though.\n\nPresentation\nAfter the story, the art is the other important feature of a visual novel, at least in one of this type. And I was pretty happy with this. The character art is good enough that you will close and lock your door to prevent anyone discovering you playing the game. Plenty of perversion to view as you spend time reading through this visual novel. It doesn't go too far, and even when there is more nudity than you would expect of a game on Steam, there are certain details not included, such as a lack of nipples in the game art. Other than that, I'm sure many players will save the images for later.\n\nOn to the music, I feel it was alright. Nothing memorable, but suitable for the current events on the screen, and no tunes that I found myself hating. Worth playing this with the volume on. There is no voice acting in this game though, which can be a turn off for some players that enjoy Japanese voice acting in these games. Everyone is a mute, and the music is all you will get.\n\nControls\nIts a visual novel. You click with the mouse to continue the story or interact with the game menu. Nothing more to it.\n\nGameplay\nAgain, its a visual novel, so nothing much to mention here. You will be reading this, not dealing with action filled combat.However, the one bit of gameplay in most visual novels is the choices you can make as you continue through the story. This one however, has a single choice, which makes no difference to the story, only a couple of scenes where you get art of different characters. Its little more than a story, honestly.\n\nLifespan\nThis title is rather short, lasting between 2 and 3 hours depending on how fast you can read. Because of the type of game this is, there really isn't much replay value. You can go for 100% Gallery unlocks, which will require you to beat the game, loading a save at the single choice point point and spending a few extra minutes to view the alternate scenes.\n\nWhile this game has no important choices to alter the story, the game ended on a cliffhanger, where hopefully you will be offered options which effect the further story. This one though, it just sets up the intro for that, and isn't really worth the asking price of $10 on Steam. A decent sale of 50% - 75% off would make it worthy of a purchase if you like the genre though.","August 29, 2014","true","3.4"," 42 of 62 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","42","62","2","1"

One of those gifts for me was this game. Just looking at the store page really answers every question about the game when you see it for the first time. And if you see the pics you don't wonder "Gee I wonder what the story is about".\nYou start off as Default McProtagonist, a guy with no interest in the opposite gender, which is clearly portrayed during the course of the game's "STORY". He's doind judo and... that's about it about him really. One day when he was going to his dojo? He happens to meet some kind of demon.. spirit... girl with huge breasts, aka the reason you bought this game in the first place. She teleports you to some sort of alternate dimension where you meet the four other protagonists, two furry girls and two very aggressive girls who are guarding some village of no real importance. The two fox girls are stealing one of the human girl's underwear. Yes. A+ story. During the course of the game you get to meet the four girls more, but mainly the fox ladies. But not only do you get to know them, no, but you are offered intercourse with them multiple times, to which Mr. Moral McHero Man responds to with "OH NO THAT WOULDN'T BE RESPECTFUL" even tho they are pretty much throwing their bodies at him. Later on you meet the game's antagonist, who is some sort of slime girl. They're really speaking to everyone's fetish here, fox ladies, slime ladies, ladies that don't want the D but actually do. Anyway, the slime girl disappears and the humans of the "Village Of No Great Importance™" become friends with the spirits. From that point on you just get to read more of the horrible writing and see more attempts of the girls to get you laid to which the no brain wonder keeps replying to with "Oh no, this is diiirty." In the end there is some kind of... fight between the antagonists and protagonists, it's nothing special really, it's just their images moving around and saying "OH NO I'M DYING PLEASE CALL AN AMBULANCE". Even tho ambulances did not exist in the time period this universe is in. Neither do female rights. Neither does interest in sex.\nThis game is great for everyone who likes to play as a self-cockblocking guy between a bunch of barely-dressed women who constantly beg for your D.\nNo nudity/10","September 29, 2014","false","7.7"," 51 of 78 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","51","78","8","7"

This is my very first visual novel I have ever played too, so I had little idea what I was getting in for, apart from the obvious....\n\nFirst let me point out that there is no amount of gameplay in this "game", I use the word "game" extremely loosely (loosely probably wasn't the right to word given the context of this game but hey). All you do for 2 hours is click and read the story; I was expecting a little bit of interaction and choice to be thrown in, but throughout the whole game, you are only presented with one choice which I have no idea whether it actually makes a difference to the ending you get.\n\nThe style of art on show in Sakrua Spirit is nicely drawn, and there has been a lot of work on the drawings of the foxes in, and yes, there is alot of sexually explicit images to be seen, personally I found them all to be a little creepy; I mean, these girls don't look exactly very old, but I suppose that's anime for you.\n\nSince this is a visual novel, you would expect the story to be at least decent, and you would be right, the story has some interesting points, some not so though. A lot of it is very cringely written with some part that actually had me staring at the screen with a confused look on my face.\n\nA full run through Sakura Spirit took me just over two hours, there is no reason to ever play this game more than once (i would struggle to recommend you do it even one time), the lack of interaction and choice make it a completely linear experience with no replay-ability.\n\nI can't really recommend Sakura Spirit, as its not a game in any sense of the word, it's cringie and boring. If you want to see barely dressed anime girls, I am pretty sure there is better stuff online. If you are really into your anime, you may get some enjoyment out of this, but this is seriously not for me.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The most evolved of our planet. We can split the atom, transplant a heart to save a life, and send our own to the moon. Some people have gone on record lifting an entire car in order to save a life. Can you believe that?\n\n\nAnd what are you doing?\n\n\nYou want to jack off to anime girls with animal ears. Big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and an ♥♥♥ with a tail. That's what you want. I'll tell you what you're not doing. Making your family proud. Some say that there are people with a face only a mother can love. You're kind of that way, only instead of your face it's your soul.\n\n\nSo you want to buy Sakura Spirit, huh? You really want to pay actual, real world money on this, huh? You're gonna download this on your PC, on Steam or whatever, and you're gonna boot it up, read through some generic Japanese hentai dialogue ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just to jack off to something you could find free online? Something BETTER, even?\n\n\nOkay.\n\n\nSakura Spirit is porn. Hentai. Asian cartoon boobies. There's no beating around that bush. Trust me, bushes are kinda uncommon in hentai. It's usually pretty clean down there. This game is full of ♥♥♥♥, asses, upskirts, downblouses, legs, thighs, and lots of wet skin. Also fur, ears, and tails. Some people are into that sort of thing.\n\n\nPosing as a crude visual novel, Sakura Spirit is really just a softcore hentai manga. And super softcore at that. You'll see plenty of cleavage and skin, but never a nipple. There's definitely a lot of suggestive dialogue, but never any actual sexing. It's like watching a porno purely for the cheesy opening dialogue, but right as the clothes start coming off you shut your computer off.\n\n\nIt takes a very special kind of person to enjoy the opening dialogue of a super cheesy porn. Most of the time, people will just skip right past it. And Sakura Spirit is no different. If you can't sit through and watch as these two people that clearly are going to bang talk in a clearly scripted and poorly acted out manner, you won't be able to stand a second of this game.\n\n\nThe dialogue is dry in that same sense. There's little substance to it. It's a light-hearted story, and the writing is sometimes humorous. But to call it witty, or clever, or really well-written is kinda pushing it. There's even some basic spelling mistakes and typos in the game, and it wasn't even developed in Japan. It'll be mildly self-aware at times, but never really enough. There's a few parts where it'll try and get you to take it seriously, as the story's main plot points come and go. There's a lore to the game. A mythos. A very well-endowed mythos.\n\n\nA young boy, self-proclaimed judo star, has been transported to feudal Japan. And that's where all these ♥♥♥♥ are, apparently. Yes, as many have you must have learned in history class, feudal Japan is famous for its many furry, voluptuous girls. Japanese people are actually born with animal ears and a tail, but they're surgically removed at birth to keep white people from beating off in their ears. Getting ♥♥♥♥ in your ears is kinda nasty. Especially if they're all furry, and the ♥♥♥ is all sticky and gunks up your hair.\n\n\nFrom there, you learn the troubled past of feudal Japan. The ones with big ♥♥♥♥ and furry ears are on bad terms with the ones that have regular human ♥♥♥♥. So you need to help them settle their differences by accidentally groping them and other hentai tropes.\n\n\nOoops, I've accidentally tripped over my virginity and my face just accidentally landed in your ♥♥♥♥. Whoops. My mistake. I couldn't see where I was going because of all the porn tropes and my ♥♥♥♥ accidentally penetrated your fox vag oops. Whoopsadoodle.\n\n\nThe target audience for this game will eat that up. They love that. ♥♥♥♥ gets them off. But to the average person, it's kinda cringey or groan-inducing.\n\n\nPeople don't watch porn for the entertainment value. Not anyone normal at least. No one wants to see the part where the teacher leans over the student's desk with her huge-♥♥♥ milf ♥♥♥♥ flopping out of her dress, asking "why are you failing my class you worthless piece of ♥♥♥♥". No one cares when the student goes "I can't stop wanking to your beefy-♥♥♥ milf ♥♥♥♥ during class, please lick my willy and I promise I'll study".\n\n\nThat's the game. That's the whole game. Only with Japanese fox girls and no actual willy licking. It's just paragraph after paragraph of build-up, and a couple clicks later there's a half-naked anime girl plastered on your screen.\n\n\nClick, click, click, ♥♥♥♥. Click, click, click, ♥♥♥. Click, click, click, boom. Huge-♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Click, click, click, bam. Game is over. You saved the world.\n\n\nIt's barely interactive. You have one choice to make in the entire game, and that's the ending. You can choose the human ending, or the fox girl ending. Aside from that, it's just clicking for ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nThis game is a step below googling "booby" or "girl butt" or "naked girl booby". That wouldn't make your parents disown you most of the time. It just kinda makes things awkward at dinner, especially after you just had the talk about why haven't you moved out yet and how a thirty year old man should have his own place.\n\n\nThe art is pretty nice at the very least. Someone could definitely spill some baby oil over this game. It is pretty generic as far as anime-style goes. All of the characters pretty much have the same face and body, just with swapped out hair and a different eye color. But that's all it takes for some people.\n\n\nFor some people, this is the best thing to happen since someone decided that anthropomorphic animals make perfect children's cartoon characters. They don't have to clear their internet history, and they don't need to worry about getting a virus on a shady website. They just go offline, fire this game up, and transport themselves to a far away land where they can use an animal's ears as ♥♥♥♥ handles without getting arrested.\n\n\nIf you're that type of person, how could I steer you away from your perfect game? What kind of person would I be, depriving you of the sweet release of extinguishing hundreds of potential lives?\n\n\nI won't judge you for your tastes. I won't judge you for your spending habits. Trust me. I have no room to judge anyone for anything.\n\n\nBut before you finalize your payment, may I suggest Google?","January 7","true","2.6"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","17","19","14","0"

The story seems to revolve around the fanservice, rather than the other way around. Where some fanservice is expected from this type of game, the story goes out of its own way to work fanservice into practically every scene. If that were the worst of the story's problems, it could perhaps be forgiveable, but there are several additional problems that turn this story from so-so to bad.\n\nThere are consistency problems within the story. At one point, I thought the program had bugged and skipped me through a part of the story, due to failure on the story's part to remain consistent within itself. There are several ways this could have been done better, but the story as it is leaves you going "Now wait a minute, I thought..." every so often.\n\nThe story does not branch. This is perhaps the most egregrious problem with the story as it stands. The visual novel presents you with exactly one choice throughout the story. In addition, the choice has no bearing on anything, only giving you the option of seeing one of two events before the two paths merge once again. There is one ending and no branching story, and you're basically taken on a ride on rails.\n\nI will withhold judgement on the numerous grammatical errors for now, as there is supposedly a patch forthcoming to address this specifically.\n\nThis story had huge amounts of potential. Unfortunately, it seems that potential will go unrealized; this visual novel has been released as a finished game instead of as an early access, indicating the developers have no desire to flesh the story out further and improve the quality of this game.\n\nI will give this visual novel credit; it has beautifully drawn pictures and good ambient music. With a good story behind it, this game could have been favorably compared to other visual novels such as Katawa Shoujo, and the story does have the potential to compare to Katawa Shoujo... with a lot of work. Without a good story behind it, though, the pictures and music can't carry the visual novel alone. As it stands, the visual novel is like a Cadillac with a go-cart engine; beautiful on the outside, but nothing worth mentioning under the hood.\n\nGraphics: 4/5\nSound: 4/5\nStory: 2/5\nInteractivity: 0/5\nOverall: 2/5","July 11, 2014","false","2.8"," 41 of 62 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","41","62","0","0"

Please read them to get a better understanding.\nIntroduction\nAfter taking on the free Katawa Shoujo (KS) which was considered to be one of the greatest visual novels ever created and originated by an internet community, I then see the release of Sakura Spirit (SS); another fictionalized, fantasy visual novel, created by Winged Cloud and published by Sekai Project. You play as Takahiro; a disciplined and determined--and yet somewhat awkward--individual Judo student who is training and reaching for the stars to become the champion of a tournament that will ultimately determine his path for the rest of his life. Why? Well, he overhears a legend in a locker room about a shrine that will make one's wish come true if they visit the shrine. He ventures out to this shrine, hoping he will find that the legend is true and make his wish, but what he discovers is unlike anything that he has ever seen before.\n\nStory\nThe story that was implemented in this visual novel was imaginative for the most part, but unfortunately it is about as linear as a board of wood, or two if both of them led to the same destination. At least there was some character development but it didn't keep me engaged enough and it wasn't in depth like KS. There are at least a few comedy moments that were awkward enough to make me smile, but sadly those moments were easily forgotten afterwards. Plus, just ONE choice in this VN? Really? There is only ONE option that results in spending time with four characters--choice A goes with two to one location, choice B goes with the other two to another location--yet it still does not change the story at all.\n\nOverall, in terms of choices and direction, I can only see people playing the story one time, saving it before that one choices, seeing both paths, and then they are done and won't play it again. So, to me it lacked in the story department.\n\nGraphics\nFor the most part I cannot complain about the graphics. The backdrops are very well done and they are nice and pretty to look at during certain scenes. The characters also have adorable facial animations depending on their mood. And I can't forget the "This game includes nudity and explicit sexual dialog" warning on the Steam Store page. There are instances where certain parts of the female's anatomy are colored and drawn in a way that are supposed to possibly engage and maybe arouse a certain audience, maybe for some like me. I found some of the "fan-service" styles and awkward moments that they went with to be a little distracting from the main storyline, such as a certain scene where a certain character was covered chest to toe in chocolate to impress Takahiro. REALLY? But I digress. Maybe that's because the story was too linear that the developers had to find a way to keep the majority of their audience engaged for the prolonged period of dialog and stills.\n\nOverall, despite a few distracting scenes, most environments like the forest, market, and temple shrine to list a few were not bad.\n\nMusic\nLike the graphics I think this is another section where SS actually holds up on its own. While some of the tracks may leave you with an annoying earworm tugging on your eardrum, I found the presentation and ambiance to be quite blissful. There were no annoying tracks that distracted me, and plus they were played appropriately. Vividly, I still can recall the "Temptation" track at this moment, with its smooth saxophonist playing in the background.\n\nOverall, the music helped make this an acceptable experience.\n\nOriginally posted by Danny Sexbang (Steam Train):"Where the F*** is that saxophonist?"\nDialog\nWhile the dialog throughout SS was good and everything was understandable, there were several times where the spelling of a certain word or a word that was supposed to be used in the right context was incorrect. Part of me wanted to jump into the VN itself and fix the spelling mistake or error that appeared but I could not do that unless I had a vast knowledge of programming and it's never too late to learn.\n\nOverall, understandable and good, just the errors bothered me slightly.\n\nFunctionality\nWell, obviously this is a visual novel so you would expect what every VN would have: auto-play, manual, pause, skip, save, (art section?), etc. Everything functions the way that it is supposed to in this.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nDo I recommend this for those who haven't experienced a visual novel before? No. Go play Katawa Shoujo first.\n\nUnless you're a huge and dedicated fan of the Sakura franchise, or you have FRIENDS to mess around with do not buy this, especially at this price.\n\nDo I recommend it on sale for $5? Well, maybe. It's short after all.\n\nHow about $2 when it was back in June of the summer sale? I would have said yes, but $10? I do not think so.","September 7, 2015","true","5.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","19","25","5","1"

Indeed hard question.\n\nIf i say truth, that i played this game just to see lovely pictures of beautiful anime characters - it would made a creep.\nIf i say that i played this game to experience immersive storytelling - it would made me a liar.\n\nSo what is the right answer, and what it is the right reason to start play Sakura Spirit ?\n\nBut let's get a  little bit  serious.\nI was really wondering what is this fuzz around this game. Then i saw couple screenshots and i get pretty good idea what is going on. Anyway i was intrigued enough to make a purchase when it was on sale. #WorthIt\n\nWeek later i decided to give it a try. To be truthful after 15 minutes i stopped paying attention to story. I skip almost whole thing and only breaks i took were for enjoying beautiful art and sexy character moments - not that type of a break (you are disgusting).\n\nOverall I have nothing much to say about Sakura Spirit, and it is even worse to rate this game on scale 0-10, because when i give a low score and recommended anyway without giving proper reasoning it is useless, and when i go with higher score without giving proper reasoning same effect applies.\n\nI just keep Recommended status, and you decide on your own merits.\n\n?/10","September 25, 2014","true","3.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The writing was cliché, the characters were cliché and the overall story was mediocre at best. Quite honestly, the story felt like a fan-fiction with some art. The main-character that basically does nothing but be somewhat strong and "kind" and apparently gets every female to like him. The other two male characters have no influence on the story.\n\nSecondly, there is essentially two options in the game that influences what the scene BEFORE the ending looks like. That's it. It does nothing to change the story or introduce new story elements. There are not routes for specific characters, no special dialouge for characters. Essentially, this VN is a book that has one "Chose Your Own Adventure" decision and ultimately changes nothing.\n\nFinally, the game is extremely short. I finished the game in approximately 90 minutes and even though I have fast reading speeds, it's ridiculous how short the game is. The choices change around eight minutes of dialogue for each.\n\nOverall...The game is essentially a fan-servicey fan-fiction with stylish art that has mediocre writing, characters anda lack of originality. I don't recommend this game for a person that's looking for a good story.\n\n","June 17, 2015","false","1.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","2"

As part of the visual novel genre, I also expected it to have long stretches of text between gameplay decisions. However, Sakura Spirit falls far under my already low expectations for it: there is very little diversity between the female cast of characters and there isn't much gameplay to be found at all—in fact, there is only one choice to make in the whole entire thing. Sakura Spirit, unfortunately, isn't much of a game at all.\n\nHad Sakura Spirit's plot been less generic, I may have forgiven it its incredibly limited player choices. However, the storyline of Sakura Spirit (a high school judo star that goes to make a wish at a secret shrine in the forest before the biggest competition of his life and is then sucked into an alternate reality where spirits exist) is somewhat overdone and rather boring. I found myself reading through an hour's worth of content and then pressing the skip button to see when I would eventually come to some sort of choice in the narrative, while also enjoying the various pictures of attractive characters in promiscuous positions.\n\nThe main character is as underdeveloped as the plot. He is both noble and easily flustered, two traits which should be endearing but are actually sources of irritation in a beta character that has absolutely no game at all when it comes to the ways of women. All of the girls are equally irritating: some will clearly try to seduce the main character and then back off at the last second while others will be innocently talking to the main character and then climb onto his lap—all of which would be perfectly acceptable if these advances ever led to any development in the relationships between characters. Instead these isolated incidents only serve to end in a main character who almost seems to be eternally friendzoned. Altogether, the characters of Sakura Spirit are lacking any compelling qualities\n\nSakura Spirit does have a couple of redeeming qualities. Some of the humor found in Sakura Spirit can be amusing, at first. The game relies heavily on pop culture references, lowbrow humor, and the overuse of common character tropes, all of which earns minor chuckles at the beginning of the game, but grows somewhat tedious later on. Nevertheless, Sakura Spirit does have the occasional redeeming moment. Unfortunately, those moments aren't frequent enough to earn it my recommendation.","September 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","1"

It isn't interactive enough to be considered a dating sim (literally one decision, and playing that one branch is maybe 20 minutes), it isn't complete enough to be called an interactive book. It doesn't commit to the cheesecake (and beyond) enough for the pervs.  It's not funny enough tie all these shortcomings into something more.  Oh yah, and it's incredibly short, even for the genre.  3 hours in and I finished both paths, looked through teh gallery, and then finally quit.\n\nIt reminds me of a low-rent Tenchi Muyo.  Which is too bad, because I like Tenchi.\n\nDon't let some of the reviews fool you, this doesn't go much further art-wise than the preview.  Literally every single piece of art in the game can be found by the front page of Google Image Search, without even clicking through.\n\nRedeeming factors:\nWhat art is there is quite good in the genre of anime cheesecake. Unrealistic, idealized, likely not matching what bones actually do, but definitely fun to look at. (if you do end up getting it, make sure to look at the gallery after beating it.  There are some entertaining outtake pictures, which you won't see in-game)\nIf this really is a prologue as suggested by the ending, then maybe there's more in this world that will be more fun.\n\nUltimately, there are better dating sims if you want that, there are better interactive novels, and there's more committed cheesecake.  Sakura Spirit seems to try and straddle all three without truly being any of them.","September 16, 2014","false","2.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Sorry, but as good as the art is, that makes this game an easy recommendation to avoid.","March 27, 2015","false","1.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

HOWEVER, this game for its price is asking a bit much. While the artwork, music, and quality of story is good. It's short amount (for an above-average reader like myself) gameplay (1-2 hours) is simply not worth the current 7:49 and would be better to be priced as a 5 dollar game. UNLESS there is more planned to be added onto this story seeing as there was only one moment in the game that you were allowed to make a choice, and the game ended with a cliffhanger about your adventure not being over yet. I wouldn't buy a sequel to this but I would countinue to play it if it were updated into a larger story (Hopefully something with a bit more span such as the medium-large amount of play time in the visual novel Katawa Shoujo).","July 9, 2014","true","2.9"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Maybe with the fact that I bought it at 70% Discount, at $2.07 by my local currency. Buying it full price is a no-no, and any discount less than that goes with a huge "Maybe." I put the rating at Not Recommended because of how most of the time you wouldn't be getting your money's worth with this game, but my opinion is a bit more complicated.\n\nNow, when you're talking about a Visual Novel, the first thing that comes to mind would be either the story or the porn. I'll just put it out here that it doesn't have any of the two. It got a story with an okay-ish foundation but horrible execution and it doesn't have porn, just almost-naked girls. You'll have a better time watching the seasonal anime than this if you want fan service.\n\nThe story is... it got some good touch, but it's ruined by lack of elaboration. Everything just happen at the speed of bullet-train and the length is as short as your disappointed b_ner. It's got what I'd call the Ground Zeroes problem, selling what is almost a demo at full price. Two dollars is a fair price for the length (just as long as Ground Zeroes' main campaign if you fast read it), which felt like maybe a quarter to half of the common route in standard VNs, but it's still lacking in many areas:\n\nThe interaction with the village, for example, would be interesting but is glossed over, the story jumps all over the place, and the worst thing is, there is only one point of choice and there is no multiple ending at all. Sometimes it got the mood right, but then comes the fan service which really disturbs the atmosphere of the story. The jokes are enough to make you grin and say "Heh," but not enough to cause a real chuckle, and that's if you're okay with standard harem anime stuffs. The ending does not resolve anything either. The writing itself is fanfiction-tier, the mediocre ones. But again, the length is the worst part. If it wants to be taken seriously, then it needs to double the length of the original story's by adding more events, then add some extras to the post-tournament stuffs, before heading to real routes. Yes, it has NO ROUTES. By the gods.\n\nCharacterization for the girls are two-dimensional. One "default" dimension (their stereotype) and one "we actually have a hidden depth" dimension. As the dimension's naming suggested, it felt like it was there only so that they could claim that the girls are not one-dimensional. Problem is, the story touches the problem but then goes "Nah! Fooled you," and not elaborate at all. The biggest offender would be Narumi and Machiko.  Narumi has a history with Machiko which might be instrumental to understanding the current situation with the spirits, but it's never explored and is abandoned except for the reasoning for some hijinks, despite how Machiko seems to had a sealed/repressed memories of it. Honestly, Narumi is so Mini-Machiko (Machiko with less traits on her) that she might as well just not be there and pass her role to Miyo, who is only made of tsundere+duty like a Mini-Aisha (Koihime Musou).\n\nThe writing/language also attempts to be a "Fan Translation"-esque in its style, addled with Japanese honorifics, which doesn't have Fan Translation's handicap of being originally made by Japanese who understands its usage. The most particularly jarring one would be how it used "Elder-sama" like they couldn't make up their mind whether to use English or Japanese for it. There is also a high usage of -chan honorifics, and the weirdly absent usage of -dono despite it being the right period of time.\n\nNow, on its arts, it's actually pretty good IF it had more variety in it. There is a distinct feels of being western-made with it, but otherwise it passes. The background isn't bad but it's ladden with straight lines and repititive backgrounds. The CG is... good enough to be mildly stimulating, but lacking in originality and creativity. The best part would probably be the shading, but that's like having a good roof but a cheap foundation - one good advanced aspect while the basics aren't well-implemented. If the length were any longer, than it would have overstayed whatever welcome it had, but otherwise it was good enough for one not to mind it too much at least.\n\nThe music has only one track that is good... but that's one out of like five or three tracks they had. They could really have just gotten some free-licenses musics as some filler, I believe some ONScripter games had free-licenses music though I will admit I don't know much about it.\n\nNow, about the only reason you'd want this game is because it's a western-made VN with easy accessibility on Steam and arts that looked good. About the only reason I could give to recommend this game would be to encourage the developers, but that's only one point out of dozens of points against it. So I will have to settle this lengthy review with a rating of:\n\n3 out of 10 - Not really good, hardly recommendable under most circumstances.","March 28, 2015","false","2.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

The text is filled with grammatical errors and poorly constructed sentences, and this can be considerably distracting.\n\nHowever, if you want a fun story with cute characters, Sakura Spirit definitely fits the bill, and its artwork is gorgeous with a consistent high quality.\n\nThe music isn't outstanding, but it does the job. As I mentioned, the story is linear. That isn't a bad thing — many stories, whether they're printed books, films or TV series are linear. Thus, one shouldn't expect Sakura Spirit to be something it's not trying to be. And yes, the story is short, though to claim that it can be completed in under an hour is definitely an exaggeration.\n\nSakura Spirit is by no means a masterpiece, but if fanservice is what you're looking for, then it's more than worth the £7 it's priced at.","July 10, 2014","true","9.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/recommended/313740/","katobytes","KatoBytes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/","87 products in account","You know, nothing agitates me more than a visual novel that lacks the gameplay length to justify the standard price it's listed on. Thankfully, I accquired this game on a sale recently, but I am generally speaking as sales don't linger eternally.\n\nSakura Spirit is an addition to an established genre of game that has recieved quite polarizing opinions.  "It's not really a game, you just read", they say, "Yeh it is, it's my beloved waifu sim that you can't get in other, uncultured genres.", they say. Sakura Spirit, take is as you will, is no different from it's peer games, which in turn gives this game the opportunity to portray why visual novels have achieved in obtaining such varying opinions.\n\nFor a visual novel, let alone a story-driven game, Sakura Spirit's plot/story is, well, okay? It isn't anything intricate really, just centers around some naive, aspiring Judo fighter that "never gives up" as he embarks in an endeavor to get the "humans" and "spirits" of Samurai Boobville to enter a state of co-existience to be able to leave the lewd world to go kick some ♥♥♥ in an upcoming tournament. Simple. However, the writers for this game lacked a sense of pacing, as until 2-3 hours of the game virtually nothing happens save for a whole bunch of inconsequential chatter regarding some DEEP Lore of Machiko, Takahiro, and the other cliche trope-yielding protagonists. Then, get ready.... for the Ecchy (Ecchi).\n\nIndeed, Sakura Spirit, considering the length (Which will be noted shortly) has an abundance of soft-core scenes. But that quantity is rendered null when finding out these scenes suck major gonads. The flaw of pacing comes back to haunt players as on the average 3 hour mark they will encouter many subsequent ecchi scenes that try earnestly to stimulate it's audience after a whole bunch of nothing. Though a few notable ones get sorta juicy, I was distraught upon finding out that these scenes are dull, derivative, and are all composed of the same recipe that will tire out just about anyone. Unless this is your first time playing these kind of games, of course, which I apologize that this has to be the precedent of all your upcoming experiences with this genre should you indulge more into it. Lastly, the game has the audacity to play the SAME DAMN JAZZ TRACK every, every time something the writers deem as suggestive occurs. At first I liked it since it had it's own grove, but it will be considerably soon when the song becomes obnoxious. Proceeding from my last statement, Sakura Spirit in all comprises a neat OST, but mind you it's probably, say, 5 or 6 tracks that will be played in cycles incessantly.\n\nMy most prominent issue in respect to this game is that it commits the ultimate sin of any visual novel, it is ridiculously short. My first (and only) playthough of this game is a little off 4 1/2 hours on record. This is unacceptable as it ostracizes everything these type of games stand for. VNs, even if it is lackluster, should nonetheless be long enough that makes the price point of said game a rational notion, and not some scheme to deliberately snatch money from wallets, just because it has bewbs. I achieved in finishing this novel to completion and even going back to make an alternate choice, in one sitting. Appalling.\n\nGranted, there were some enjoyable moments reading this visual novel but it is ultimately a disapointment. Sakura Spirit is a 5 hour trek of already familiar themes and content that will be detrimental in most experiences. Only players unfamiliar with the genre will find any significant enjoyment with this one as it is admittably accessible. Most will just avert their gazes to... something better. And the TL;DR of this review is essentially that. There is better things out there, and cheaper too.","January 15, 2015","false","4.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

I got it when it was in sale so it dind't seem like the short story was a waste of money. And for all the people who are not into Visual Novels or don't have any experience with them.

At least it actually functions properly, and doesn't have an issue with running on ALL OTHER brands of GPUs except the one the developper used when creating it!\n\nThe game actually runs smoothly, and despite the story being, of course, shallow and uneventful at times, at least, it's bareable, and makes looking at the well drawn ♥♥♥♥ and asses conveniently censored to keep the shallow minded community on Steam happy, at least tolerable.\n\nI'd say, if you're looking specifically for a game to fap to? This is as good a game as it gets if you're for some reason deciding to look for these games on a 3rd party software whose TOS directly doesn't allow full on sexual games.\n\nThe controls are very customizable, allowing you to choose whether the game should progress on its own, and how fast/how many seconds it takes between frames to appear, or for new text to appear. You can also simply have it set to remain on the same page until you click any key. This gives the possibility of maximum storyline immersion, or maximum fap capability, depending on your individual desires.\n\nRegardless, I recommend this game purely due to the type of game it is. It would be unfair to rate this game compared to the rest of the games on Steam, as this is hardly a 'game' and more a story telling session, with lots of blushing boobs and conveniently nude, but not revealing, bodies.\n\nI'd say, for what it is? It's one of, if not the, best Ecchi game on Steam, and if you're deliberately looking for this sort of game(BAKA HENTAI!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/getgoodgetbanana/recommended/313740/","getgoodgetbanana","banana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/getgoodgetbanana/","55 products in account","Sakura Spirit is a visual novel that follows the main character's journey into a world that is implied to be his city, but from some time in the past. In this world, he dicovers two fox-spirits and two regular human guards that become his close friends. The story focuses on our main characters bond with these four girls, and wraps up with them preventing some destructive slime-spirits from destroying the village.\n\nBefore you buy this, please keep in mind that this is NOT a game. It is a visual novel with only 1 choice for you to make. It is also very short. You can finish the story within 2 hours. This, combined with a few more features, makes me not want to reccomend the game:\n\nTHE GOOD-The artstyle is phenominal. All the background look very nicely drawn and are aesthetically pleasing, if slightly generic. All the characters are drawn well, and this is emphasised during the unlockable scenes that you can later view in the gallery. I would have liked to see more of the scenes animated however, as most of them were static images, or simply not shown at all and rather explained through text.\n\nTHE BAD-The story is mediocre at best. Despite the fact that it's not easy to create a good story that only lasts for 2 hours, the plot manages to be largely focused toward the wish fulfilment of the player.\n-The characters themselves are relatively simple. The four main girls have cutout personalities, including: the Tsundere, the mature one, the childish one, and the tease/flirt. None of the characters get much development, excluding maybe one of the foxgirls who was friends with one of the guards as a child. The main character himself loves judo, and that's as far as his development goes. All other characters are negligible in terms of relevancy and development, including the namesake of the game.\n-The music is average. None of the tracks were bad per say, but none of them were memerable. I ended up turning the music quite far down during my playthrough. The only theme i really liked was that of the main menu.\n-There is no nudity. AT ALL. Even if you're playing with your hand in your pants, you're going to have to settle for softcore porn at best. If that's not enough for you, I suggest you look elsewhere.\n-You cannot ♥♥♥♥ any of the girls\n-You cannot ♥♥♥♥ the childhood friend\n-You cannot decide which pair of girls you like better in-game\n-You will never have two qt3.14 fox girls taking care of you in no clothes and wanting to ♥♥♥♥ you\n-None of these girls will ever be real\n-Why even live\n\nOverall, I rate this "game" 4/10. The only part of this experience that I can say i enjoyed was the art, but if you really wanted to view it for yourself, I'm sure it's online somewhere. The game is not worth it's pricetag, only buy this if you are deadset on seeing virtual cleavage in first person, and are not expecting anything else.\n\n","June 20, 2015","false","4.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

Have you ever played something that you felt was completely NOT made for you? Welcome to Sakura Spirit. To be honoest, I was bought in by the graphics style, and had hoped for a persona-like experience, I was a little put off by the absence of male charecters in the first impressions, however, I hoped that would allow them to personalize their charecters more. This is, to its' very perverted core, fanservice to the greatest extreme, there is not a single moment at any point in time I was "playing" this visual novel when you did not feel unhinged knowing that you are NOT the person who is supposed to see this, honestly, I would hesitate to call this a game, I've seen many game critics say that a game requires difficulty, but this game avoids dear ester levels of player of involvement with a single choice, there is one choice of the game, one, at the very end, about which team of girls you want to start off at the summer festival with, it really takes you out of the game, constantly stopping to click and go foreward, akwardly switching position in your chair out of sheer embarressment. I swear, there is more clicking in this game than in a dolphen-exclusive school for morse code (i'm sure i've heard that metaphor before, but this "game" sucked the originality out of me) There is no combat, you cannot fail this game, just keep clicking and you win, the end. The ending is abrupt, you think the kane and lynch 2 was bad? You haven't seen anything yet, this thing just shoves a big grey wall between you and more clicking fun as soon as the game realized it's budget on breasts was a few digits too high. It's rather sad really, because animation can provide a great range of expression, and when weilded correctly, can make some funny characters, yet this "game" squanders it, and instead takes the lazy approach of fanservice instead of actual character progession and clear personalities, I'll touch more on that in a minute, first, I'm going to focus on the laziness that drips from every pore of this games putrid hole. Instead of animation for their charecters, the developers just switch through unmoving still frames of charecters in a certain position, very often reusing those, look through the main slideshow of screenshots, look for the white haired fox-girl, she is in the same position for 5 of the 7 pictures, they simply changed what the facial animation was and called it a day. The game was also not voice acted, which I would complain more about, however, knowing the actors they would hire, i'm rather glad they just came to the table with the stock soundtrack.\n\nNow, the most important part: The Character.\nCharacterization is essential for any game that has a strong exphasis on text-based relationships between characters, and this game did the entire thing wrong. The entire point of personifying your charecters is to make them each conform to a certain steriotype, but then break free of some of its' tenents, for example, in the game Persona 4, one of the main charecters is a head-strong female lead who I could go on to talk about, but suffice to say, she is a very solid female tomboy who is rather ungirlish in almost every way, except she has a huge phobia of insects and spiders, now, that's not a very original idea to be sure, but the idea of making your charecters individual is, well, making them have personalities of their own! Instead this game spits into the face of that concept, going out of it's way to conform it's charecters into every female trope in a harem anime (an animation in which a male is accousted by several female all infautuated with the male for no better reason that "he's nice", it's all wish forfillment really) even nicknamed one of it's characters after the trope they used, I think they were trying to break through the fourth wall, but they fell on the first hurdle really. The whole thing kind of stings, as the animation and lack of sound quality could have been gotten around had there been a great deal more choices and better writing, as well as a longer storyline. Honestly, I can only remember one attempt at personifiying one of the characters, but instead, I just found it to be offensive, as it felt more akin to damage control as the dev's knew that they would get crap over  the lack of personification, characters should not be defined by a single incident, look at Telltale's The Walking Dead (the good one) for example, there was no defining moment between Lee and Clementine, only the growing urge to protect her as the world turned to ♥♥♥♥, instead, this "game" tries to have it's cake and eat it too but ends up spilling the cake on it's lap and biting onto the fork.\n\nWho would I recomend this game to: Ah, finally, the important part. Okay, if you are looking for gameplay, get out. If you are looking for story, get out.  If you are looking for a game that will calm your nerves after a hard day at work, get out. If you are looking for charecters, why the hell are you here and not playing The Wolf Among Us Season finale (it came out on the same week this "game" went on sale, and the same week I'm writing this review). This game is not playable by 99/100s of the general population, and for good reason, I did not go into this game hoping to tear it apart, and I found a good chuckle or two in the strory, but this game REEKS of fanservice, for example, remember that character who is named after a trope, the trope is called Tsundere, and i'm not an expert, but from what I looked up this is about correct, but Tsundere is a term usually used in animations, it comes from the base word "Tsun" and "Dere", "Tsun" means cold and cruel, while "dere" means kind and caring, so basically it's a character who is outwardly cold but inwardly kind. But that "Tsundere" thing is a running joke in this "game", a joke that only a very small percentage of people would actually get, and the game knows that! This game knows who it is marketed towards, and it knows who is buying it, and it doesn't try to really be anything else, other than that lame attempt at "characterization". And all that's not a problem, I'm not going to kick their door down and yell out  my expectations of their game, and they likewise don't have to service me a bit, i'm not who they are aiming for. This game is a very short trip (I did a speed run, which consisted of skipping through the dialog texts, the game lasted exactly 2 minutes, 7 seconds, if you read the text, it might take an hour or 2), which doesn't attempt to service any people but the people it intends to, theose people will be serviced, and everyone will go about their day, but by god, if you don't know if this game is for you, IT IS NOT FOR YOU. If you know it's your cup of tea, get it immediatly, you will not be dissapointed.\n\nI had a bit of trouble coming up with a Yes or No for the game, because it doesn't try to really be good, only to service certain people, but eventually I came to the decision that even if it completely succeeded at what it tried to do, it's still a bad game.","July 11, 2014","false","5.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","3"

Joking aside, it was pretty meh.  Only had ONE choice that didn't really effect anything other than one scene.  It was extremely short.  I have seen longer prologues than this whole thing.  In the end if said this was just the prologue to something else but IMO that's just a cop out.   They're basically selling a demo for 10 dollars...  Plus there's the fact that they're just this close to showing naughy things but don't ACTUALLY do anything (and steam wouldn't sell a VN with horizontal movement).  I also didn't like the overly Japanese music that much.   Hell, even the Japanese VNs I've played (all better than this too) didn't have that overly try hard "Japanese" style music.  It's a short, boring, blue balling VN that costs 10 dollars.    Honestly, while Katawa Shoujo wasn't perfect, it was way better than this and it's free.\n\n"♥♥♥♥, right?"

I for one enjoyed it very much, the dialogue was very well done, the art is fantastic, and the characters are memorable. Yet there are many reviews that are just...dumb (mostly just "Panties Simulator 2015, A great game for Valentines day...") . Sorry if those people are reading this but I was tired of reading the same kind of review over and over again, so, I would like to do a serious review on this game. I will give you a list of what the game has to offer.\n\n* The major characters in this game are Sakura, Maeko, Miyo, Machiko, Narumi, The Village Elder, and Tsuyuri.\n* The game has a gallery in the main menu where you can view certain images (All sexual) from the game.\n* WARNING: This game does have sexual dialog/content, but I'm sure you've noticed that already.\n* The main character (You) is Gushiken Takahiro, a rising Judo student confident in becoming a Judo star where there is a      Tournament that he must prepare for.\n* The spoiler isn't really that major at all but it would still be good to get the game to get to the twist.\n* There is only one choice you get to make in the game, just letting that out there.\n* As I have said before, the game is quite long if you read it, so prepare to do something some people never do...Read.\n* If you want the best experience for the game, turn on the light in you're room (Try to dim it if you can), get comfortable, be ready to get a boner (I'm telling you now, you will get it in the game)\n* There is NO audio in the game so you will have to imagine the characters voices.\n*Last but not least, the soundtrack. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. By far one of my most favorite parts about the game, it has such a great feel to hearing it, the soundtrack was so good, that they had it for purchase.\n\nWell thats all I have to say for this game. I hope you buy the game and enjoy it as much as I did.\n\n\n\n\nNarumi is best character! :3 :narumi:\n\n\n\n\n\n","March 25, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Sorry for the negative rewiev.\n\nI got "Hatoful boyfriend" as a gift awhile ago and really enjoyed it. Not after long Sakura spirit started showing up on featured games as a recomandation. Time after time after time it was there and I thought that maybe i should give these ladies a chance.\n\nHowever I did not wish to pay that much for the game and waited until it got on sale.\nAs I sat down to play it I had a few thoughts and began to think.\nAfter more than 2 hours I got to the first choice - whch later turned out to be the only choice in the whole game. and I thought "maybe I will get more influense from here?" How wrong was I there...\nAfter completing the first time I unlocked the skip button to dialog I had read. Thank god.\nBut it wasn't great after that. Heres a few things to sum it up:\n\nPositive:\n* Great soundtrack. I really like it.\n* Ok plot.\n* Pretty girls.\n* Nice clothing for the girls that looks awesome.\n* The drawing and pictures looked awesome.\n* The skip button.\n\nNegative:\n* Only 1 choice in the entire game. And it doesn't even matter!\n* "This game includes nudity and explicit sexual dialog." No. Not exactly... The dialog is some times "flirty".\n* Taka-whatever (the person you are in the game) is a womanizer at heart. He acts and seems to be under the illusion that he is the most handsome guy on the planet. Maybe even in the universe. I really dislike him and had problems connecting with him.\n* The girls are under the same illusion as the character you play.\n* The girls even seems itemnized at points.\n* Most of the dialog is so annoying I wished I had the skip button when I first played/read through the "game".\n* This "game" challenged my intelligence in a very bad way. I was thinking "Seriously??! What?!?" most of the time.\n* The plot could have been a little better. However the dialog has a long way to go to be good.\n* The price of this "game" should be lower. Around half of it might be worth what you get for the money.","November 25, 2014","false","3.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The problem is, the reason you're here is the entire depth of this 2 hour visual novel. The characters actually have interesting personalities, but they aren't thoroughly developed, and every other minute, a character is either throwing themselves at Keichi (all of the girls), having something "unfortunate" happen where he sees them without their clothes, or somebody is being super perverted. It's not normally my thing, but when it's this blatant, I can't just laugh it off. There is something to be said about developing a plot, building a romance off of actual values, and having a pay off; this just skips all of the build up and goes straight to the climax, which undercuts the potential.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the goal was to cater to the 18-28 male demographic without any shame, which it did successfully. I kind of expected it to be what it is, but ultimately was left disappointed as the characters could have been more.","May 13","false","2.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sophiahapgood/recommended/313740/","sophiahapgood","FF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sophiahapgood/","225 products in account","This game is incredibly boring. There's no ability to make separate choices, and the story is absolutely horrible. The Linux port is good, I guess, but since there's simply nothing happening besides moving images it would be hard to screw up.\n\nYou start out in your room, preparing to go to school. You try to leave in your pajamas. Hilarious. You go back and change, and "accidentally" show the girl you go to school with your birthday suit. Fascinating. Something happens, you wind up in a locker room, talking about something, some shrine in a the forest. Something something, guy in front of you admits to spying on a woman changing, or at least it seems, the dialog is so unremarkable that it's difficult to maintain focus on it.\n\nNow you're in a forest. Female voice. Finally, you see the boobs! Well, they're covered up. The bland music continues in the background as you see yourself in the forest watching two half clothed girls chasing two less clothed girls for stealing their underwear, what crazy hijinks. At this point, I am left clicking so fast to escape the dreadful story that I keep accidentally right clicking, which leads me to the main menu- quite annoying.\n\nSomething, there's a judge, you're on trial for stealing underwear - a truly crucial part of the story is taking place here - and one of the girls is flirting or maybe not... yeah, that was as far as I got. The images aren't spectacular at all. The characters have the ability to slide across the screen and change their facial animations only very slightly (there's 2 or 3 different faces they can make, usually just changes in their eyes and mouth), and that's all.\n\nThe music is boring. The graphics are boring. The story is beyond boring. The only thing that happens is the background occasionally changes, you see the same stock images of the girls over and over, and the only action that happens is you clicking your mouse with increasing desperation and speed, to go from one sentence of the story to the next.\n\nDon't recommend. If you want to see ♥♥♥♥, spend your money on a Crashpad subscription or something.","March 24, 2015","false","0.2"," 37 of 68 people (54%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","54","37","68","8","2"

I'd rate it high for artwork, but low for choice making. so call it a qualified recommendation, for the reasons stated below:\n\nThere is only one choice for the reader to make in the whole reading, and it doesn't really affect the outcome.\n\nThat said, I thought the artwork was quite good, and the story was decent enough, but I would not buy this if you are looking for a game with choices to make. (Heroes Rise: The Prodigy, and Heroes Rise: The Hero project are much better for choice making, but lack artwork).\n\nThe story seemed to be the prologue of a much longer story though, given the end credits end with a teaser.  Perhaps I'll give the story another chance if they come out with a "Sequel", but again, it's the anime style artwork that was the draw for me.\n\nIf you do decide to get this visual novel, be sure to wait for it to be on sale. I usually rate my games on how much I have to spend in terms of dollars per hour. This novel lasted about an hour and then some, so it doesn't rate high in that respect.\n\nIf you don't mind spending the time to read a light short story, and enjoy ecchi anime art, then it's not so bad. But again, I'd wait for the novel to go on sale.","July 9, 2014","true","2.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

You can finish the game either an hour or less.  In terms of art, they are really well delivered in designing the heroines, other characters and the visual background.

There is only one choice near the end of the game that doesn't change the the outcome and effectively only forces you to load an autosave to unlock one more screen. You can blow through Sakura Spirit in about half an hour which is one of the few positives because you wouldn't want to play it any longer than that. I wouldn't call it a visual novel either because of the poor quality writing, and trust me, I've played a lot of trashy eroge. The story reads like a junior highschoolers fanfiction. The protagonist is a socially awkward fedora aficionado who shoots down every attempt of the lovely ladies throwing themselves at his feet him for no comprehensible reason. All whilst justifying his sexual frustration by reassuring himself of how much of a gentleman he is for doing so.\n\nIf you're new to the genre and looking to play a dating game I would suggest "Katawa Shoujo" or if you must play on Steam check out "Go! Go! Nippon!"\n\nAnd if you are a clever teenager looking to sneak around parental locks to oggle some anime girl breasts then you can find them on the screenshots page!\n\nHappy fapping!\n\n- Otaku Airman","November 11, 2014","false","3.0"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

There is only one choice to make in the entire story, and that choice only seems to affect the gallery. I still have to do a speed run and choose the other option to be sure. Either way, it has nothing to do with the Tenchi Universe-style problem of all of the girls falling all over him while he avoids relations with them all.\n\n2) Nudity? Puleeze. I've seen more skin at a regular beach. Breasts without nipples does not count as nudity. Honestly, I think the flesh-colored balloons were the only "nudity" in the whole thing. Sure, there is plenty of fan service all over the place, but if you really want to see naked anime girls and whatnot, go find some hentai or something. If you want nudity in general, there are TONS of PG-13 and R rated films out there offering way more.\n\n3) Mature? Only if your children have been closeted. From what I've seen in the reviews and guides, it looks like it's actually the immature that get their jollies on this one.\n\n4) The warning includes "explicit sexual dialog." I would say that everything "sexual" in this story was rather weak.\n\nAs it was progressing, I was actually hoping it would morph into a dating sim and that I would get to see the "losers" catfight each other, and that other complications and choices would arise. Alas, it was a letdown on that part. So, that "Dating Sim" tag really needs to go.\n\nLuckily, I got this on sale. There's no way I would pay $10 for a rather generic combination of themes and story. My recommendation only applies if you get it for less than $3.\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

What Sakura Spirit is, is simply a lot of well drawn images mixed with a lot of text. I have to give the artists credit with their ability to draw, but other than that there isn't much else.\n\nLet's start with the story. It starts off interestingly enough and yes I read all of it. There is one choice in this manga that you can make and it doesn't really have much of an impact, in fact it just shows your a different point of view.  The most you're going to have to do is really read and click. That's it. Each of the characters do have their own quirks and characteristics but it's really hard to translate who the characters are with still images and text so it leaves a lot to the player to make connections to the characters themselves. Overall though, the story itself is mostly just a male fantasy with a bunch of girls continually hitting on you and you really have no option but to take it and really do nothing about it.   It's pretty linear, straightforward and it's not exactly executed well.  The fact that you never really see the male protagonist, who is named and already has a personality really breaks player immersion as well, contributing to the aspect that this isn't a game.\n\nVisuals: Okay now this is where this manga's strong points really are. Every image is well drawn, and really pretty. You can tell the artists had fun drawing the characters in different poses but there isn't enough. My major quirk is that this isn't animated. It's a lot of still frames with a few scenes having the same characeter with the three different progessional still frames to show them in different states. But most of the time its just a single still frame. The art could have been really amazing if they had animated the scenes, granted it would have been A LOT more work, but at the same time it's something that you should be prepared to put in while you're working on a game or if your art in general is going to be the fundamental focus of your game.\n\nGameplay.\n\nOverall if they made this more actiony, gave the player more freedom in choices and some cool combat, this would actually be a game, and I could see it as being something entertaining. There would be a break in the constant slow pace of reading through paragraphs of dialogue and allow more control for the player that a game should give.\n\nRating: his game should be rated around pg-13 or a little higher, its nowhere near 18+. It has suggestive dialogue, and while there is some nudity it's all suggestive and covered. You will not see anything. I played this game in my lecture hall because of how tame it was. My suggestion, if you're going to go for it, give it 100% don't bother holding back.\n\nMy recommendation: T If you're looking for a really light, linear manga with really pretty images and a lot of suggestive content. Then sure, I can see that you may get some enjoyment from this, otherwise, I can't really recommend this for anyone. For those looking for some form of hentai buy the game, support the devs, but it isn't worth it. There was a lot more that could have been done, and I hope the devs really try and push what they can do with their other work.","March 26, 2015","false","2.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I thought it looked nice, so I bought it. Big mistake. While the art for character sprites and event CG's is well done, and it has nice backgrounds, that's about as far as it goes visually since everything else looks like they barely tried and looks bland. Although even then the art has impossible breast-physics and the girls all look fundamentally the same just with different hair, eye colours, and clothes.\n\nThe 'story' and characters were...\nWell, about ten to twenty minutes into playing, I decided I was thoroughly bored and uncaptivated by the story or the characters and skipped the rest of it just to see the CG art. There was nothing really likeable about anyone besides that they were vaguely cute, and other than that were a cliche mess.\nThere was also a lot of historical incontinuity and other mistakes with the labels of weapons and such.\nThere is a single choice in the whole game that affects nothing besides giving you some more CG's of pretty much just the girls breasts and nothing more.\n\nThe music wasn't anything special, although I got so sick of one track -I'm not even sure which one it was now- that I ended up muting the game. The rest was just plain unremarkable.\n\nI feel wholly unsatisfied and disappointed that I've played visual novels in languages I can barely understand and be far more captivated and intrigued than this one that's written in my native language. For me personally, nothing salvages this 'game', not even the cute artwork.","January 2, 2015","false","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The characters don't even have any sort of personality that sticks.. they're just open ended, and their moods fluctuate to make everyone fit in to whatever is going on which makes them bland.\n\nI get now that the point of this game isn't the story line, but at least keep them moving in their own pace.\n\n","January 13, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

To be perfectly honest, I got this game for the boobs, and in this aspect, it did not disappoint.\n\nYes, I'm perfectly secure about my sexuality and did not start giggling like a teenage ret*rd when I was presented with anime breasts. And this seams to be the main problem when I see the reviews complaining about this "game" (but this is another debate, since I don't really consider VNs games but rather an own form of media). Since when does the fact of something showing skin make anything bad? By that standart, I can see a lot of people justifying r*pe because the victim wasn't dressed properly and other poor excuses.\n\nQuite honestly, I really liked the drawings made for it. I found them rather tasteful and sexy, and I'd say for 5 bucks they were totally worth the money. But from the technical aspect of a VN, Sakura Spirits is more disapointing than bad.\n\nThe story actually is okay, it is just unfinished. The writer really took a liking to the characters and made up some scenes meant to show off each one of them (personality-wise as physically) in a rather clichéed way, but that's what you actually expect, so there's nothing wrong from that point of view. The main character too, is actually rather sympathetic.\n\nBut here already come the problems: in a VN, or you give every character, as minor as they are, a portrait to go along with, or you give them solely to the main cast. But here it seems like the devs couldn't decide what to do and gave them to the main cast and three random people you meet at the beginning of the novel who are never to be seen again, although they seemed rather like key figures for later on. I suppose that proves Winged Cloud's decision to give every character a portrait. I don't know exactly what they did, but it felt unnatural. Maybe it was the fact that we never saw the initial three people again.\n\nAnd this fact actually clashes with the notion of poor writing, in a sense of it becoming very noticeable towards the end that the writer really didn't know where to go with all he had made up until now and dumped everything in a cliff-hanger, in the hopes they could fix everything in a sequel.\n\nBy the way, Sakura Angels and the anounced Sakura Fantasy have nothing to do with Sakura Spirits, story-wise. Yepp.\n\nLet that sink in: you are presented to a world and characters which don't carry any importance whatsoever. And that is the real problem here, if you bother to show something in a good story, it's because it is some integral part of the whole thing. Even if you show something to flesh out the world the story plays in, it is still good enough if it at least serves that purpose to the reader, but here it felt like a mess. And it really just feels that way because of how abrupt it ends.\n\nThat is not to say the VN is not enjoyable. It actually is, trust me! If you like to read, and anime, it might be worth checking out, even if you just enjoy looking at anime chicks. The art is excellent! But Sakura Spirits just isn't the full package. The impression it gives off is that the devs had something really promising at hand, but decided to rush the product out as fast as possible when they were only midway through the story because they were getting short of money. Which, by now, they should have made enough of it to fix this problem giving Spirits a decent closure with a proper sequel.\n\nSakura Spirit is a promising VN that leaves you hanging and angry if you enjoy a good plot with closure. Don't buy it if you want it for the story. But if you are satisfied with a superficial character study and good drawings, you might get your kicks out of this VN.","April 16, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

Whatever). The writing is absolutely abysmal, filled with out of place japanese terms (Kami, imouto, etc.), typos and extremely juvenile content. It barely makes any sense and the characters are all annoying stereotypes.\n\nThe presentation is a bit better with some fantastic backgrounds, unfortunately this is technically a nukige without sex or nudity so most of the time they are covered with non-stop fan service that ends up dragging this game down even more. It's a shame since again, it's not an ugly looking game, hell, the UI is extremely clean and there are tons of options but really... do you need over 10 save slots for a 3-4 hour long visual novel with two choices?! The music is pretty average though, not a single track was particularly memorable to me.\n\nOverall, if you want a visual novel with decent writing that's actually fun in a not cringeworthy way on Steam you could check out Christine Love's games, World End Economica, the upcoming Grisaia No Kajitsu and Higurashi or hell, Paca Plus and Hatoful Boyfriend. Or you could go to JAST or MangaGamer and buy Kara No Shoujo, ef: A Fairy Tale Of The Two, Saya No Uta, Aselia The Eternal or a full on hentai game since this game is stuck being softcore porn and it's even more poorly made than most nukiges out there.

Twilight has a better writing style. the music choices are very limited don't match the pictures most of the time and are overused and not very good. you'll have 5 minutes of a slightly sexualized picture on the screen while you read about fighting them.\n\nWhat truly sets this apart from other visual novels such as the Famed (and free) visual novel Katawa Shoujo is the sheer number of choices it give you. 1. it gives you 1 choice in the entire game. and it's an either or. it's also 2 hours of reading into it. and I'm a very fast reader. and it doesn't even decide which person you end up with. it changes a little of one scene and that's it. this is not worth buying or playing spend your money on something more worthwhile like free internet porn which will have a better written story. the way this game ends is very clearly trying to lead up to a sequel and maybe they'll do better with that one. but save your money and buy a hat in TF2 or something","August 15, 2014","false","2.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/recommended/313740/","phoenix_advance","phoenix_advance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenix_advance/","515 products in account","I bought Sakura Spirit for a little over $3. Thank goodness because I don't reckon it's worth full price. If you can snatch this game for less than $2 then it may be worth it. You buy this game absolutely for its title. Sakura Spirit is very catchy marketing-wise. In comparison a title like Nekopara Vol. 1 isn't (although a better game).\n\nIt's not the game that everyone thinks it is (and certainly not what I thought it would be like). The store page says something like it contains nudity and explicit sexual dialog. Maybe that is true for a nine year old playing the game. Anyone below that age just wouldn't understand. So that's just false marketing. No nipples means no nudity in my books.\n\nGameplay-wise it's just a story. Very long story! Made me so tired, I fainted more times than Maeko-chan. There's very minimal graphics content. Character templates and backgrounds were highly reused throughout the game. Within a 6 hour time frame of playing the game and the many scenes, you will only witness about fifteen special artworks. All of which is neatly packed into a "Gallery" option in the main menu. Other than that, all characters strike the same pose and wear the same outfits throughout!\n\nIn all honesty I was hoping to see some animation or something that will show the emotions of the characters. Like a character raising an apple with their hands, whether the character is embarrassed or camera panning of the scenery. Instead you miss out on small fast transitional winks and smiles on character faces because it only happens once after you press spacebar to move onto the next dialogue. Speaking of which, there was a lot of unforgiveable grammatical errors in the dialogue.\n\nMusic was really repetitive and started to get annoying. It sounded like 50's classical porn music during every area or situational change. But if the area or the situation was same or similar, the music will be repeated.\n\nFor me the Steam overlay is very sluggish for some reason in this game. That was also annoying as heck!\n\nThis might sound a bit cheesy, but one of the reasons I bought this game was because I played a similar kind of game, perhaps more explicit XD back in late 2001. I don't remember the game name, but what I do remember was that aside from the game knowing how to poke fun into the player dialogue-wise, the backgrounds and scenery were very Japanese-like. And that is something Sakura Spirit really missed out on. They forgot the attention to detail culturally. Like I still remember a scene so vividly in 2001 where I was staring at an office space. Everything like the computer, the cabinets, desk, the placement of the windows ... it was just so ... for lack of a better description, Japaneseish. And everything like the camera panning was there. You would think more than 13 years later something like Sakura Spirit would be better made.\n\nAbout 3 hours of reading into Sakura Spirit the story picks up pace. It's not great, but not bad either. The development team was pretty damn small, something like 5, so it's forgivable in terms of lack of production value. But if this team has reaped some monetary rewards from this game, I expect their next release to at least have some game engine and content as good as Nekopara Vol. 1 which even has the characters talking in Japanese.\n\nLast thing to mention, there is only one multiple choice option to take towards the end of the game. I guess it was ok since saving in Sakura Spirit is a breeze. Eventually the story merges to the same thing as the alternate choice during some end battle. So the re-reads isn't that long. I'm not really a big fan of alternate endings or choices unless there is a real purpose to it gameplay-wise. But thankfully this was a short one.\n\nI don't really highly recommend this game, unless you can accept everything I have stated above. But otherwise I recommend since it wasn't a bad game overall and I don't feel like I was completely cheated with the amount I paid.","January 12, 2015","true","6.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","4"

Games require as per their definition the ability to play them, and this piece of software does not meet that definition in the most basic sense. The software consists entirely of one choice towards the end of the story, and in fact has more choices when configuring the preferences than when playing it.\n\nAs a review of the software, as I'm now calling it, it had a very nice interface. With transparancy, and a nice clean and consistent look with many sakura flowers. The save feature had multiple image slots for save games to show exactly where each save in the storyline was. It also featured many preferences, however some of them were lacking in ability. The auto story mode could only be configured from impossibly slow to painfully slow leaving you reading the text far faster than the next line appeared. The other features seemed to work as expected text speed, skip feature, and volume controls.\n\nThe software featured all of the expected tools for the type of game it attempted to be without any of the gameplay. The art of the software was well done, and enjoyable. The story was great as a sort of satire of the common tropes of this genre, and perhaps the utter lack of gameplay was again a satire on the genre, however, I found it went too far.\n\nOverall you should not buy this game, but if you enjoy these types of games this may be worth a purchase for the laughs.","January 9, 2015","false","4.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I will be very general for spoiler reasons. See the table below for a "in-a-nutshell" rating\n\nReason: Friend Gift, Light-Hearted Enjoyment\n\nThe Big Bad: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\n\nPlot: The plot is very wild. It takes you all over the place. While this method is not necessarily bad, the way the novel executes this method is just poor. If you're looking for a good story to sit back and be emotionally invested in, this is not the game for you.\n\nCharacter Development: The novel throws characters at you, with no significant development. There may be one or two good "side development," but it is ruined by the sudden stop in that development.\n\nThe Graceful Good: （´・ω・ `）\n\n"Plot"/ Artistic Style: The characters, while they may be distinguishable by only mere differences such as hair color, are drawn as being aesthetically pleasing to the reader's eye. I praise the author's in investing at least a bit of their budget in this portion of the novel. It made scrolling through the novel that much more rewarding.\n\nLength of the Game (Debatable): This novel was designed to be a light-hearted novel that gives the reader a nice tickle after a long time of studying or using their brain. Thus, it was pleasurable to take a break from studies, but not too engaging like games such as Team Fortress 2 Or Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Personally, I did not feel like I was losing sense of time finishing this game.\n\n*Genre: While the genre of fox girls and dimensional-warping is overused, sticking to the stream of fans that love this genre is a notable decision by the author, and I praise them for this notion. However, I challenge them to make a game that is unique and original in its content.\n\nSee this table for a "in-a-nutshell" rating.\n\nType	Great!	Okay	Bad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/garganator/recommended/313740/","garganator","Kejmur - AFK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/garganator/","3691 products in account","Let's say I need to start this review by saying that I LOVE visual novels. Katawa Shoujo, Cinders, , Kira Kira, Dear Drops, Hatoful Boyfriend, Quartett and others titles from this genre are something I read and enjoyed most of them as all of them contained really good stories with interesting and likeable characters (Misha hardcore fan from Katawa Shoujo :D) with that important element, which make me come back to them and read them again. They were all special in their own ways.\n\nBut unfortunately there are some Visual Novels which lack in many elements, making them unfortunately inferior to other titles of this genre. Unfortunately Sakura Spirit is one of those titles. And trust me, I'm REALLY lenient on how I review Visual Novels, as I have soft spot for them in my heart. But I can't force myself to give positive review for this one.\n\nNormally I would start by saying how plot looks like and what you may expect from the story, but problem is that... story here doesn't really exist. I realize what kind of genre this VN hits into (I LOVE Ecchi, so yeah :D), but you know, I expect something else as a bonus to at least review it in positive way. To summarize it it's about a hero which is promising Kung-Fu fighter which ends up in another world after visiting certain temple to pray for some luck. Later it's just 2 fights, some dialogues which don't really add anything useful to the story and mostly embarrasing situations which are the essence of ecchi stories (yeah, BOOBIES) and... that's it. In this VN there is ONE route and TWO choices where you 'decide' what happens next and those choices make story look really similar to each other. When you compare it to something like Kira Kira which may last even +40 hours or more, this is just depressing. Sorry folks, Visual Novels are about reading story and it's hard to call this a story when it's so short. It should take you max 3 hours if you are really lenient and 1,5-2 hours if you read it at somewhat decent pace. Also I noticed lots of grammatical issues, which let's face it shouldn't really happen in something that is all about reading (and enjoying some views :D). For me at this point this title looks like an incomplete VN with just one route and... zero additional content, in almost hardcore alpha state, which shouldn't be released yet in my opinion.\n\nBut I need to say that one thing in this title is good - Art. Girls are sexy, adorable and well, you may enjoy their looks for sure. If you look for eye candy when it goes to art, this one is pretty good choice in this regard. I need to salute and congratulate the artist, as he did one hell of a work. I can't say bad word about it.\n\nTo summarize it - it's ecchi title which is just... ecchi. It provides nothing else as story pretty much doesn't exist and it's so short that 10 euro is too high of a price tag for a title with flaws glaring as those. While I love to look at some anime-like ladies and I'm big fan of ecchi, I'm afraid good art alone isn't even close to give this title a serious consideration. Buy it ONLY on serious discount and if you are hardcore ecchi fan. My honest advice.","September 7, 2014","false","6.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","4"

This game has in the end just one route which leads to a very unfurfilling and somewhat predictable end and to make matters worse, the ending comes right at the part where you think that you finally get the dating-sim part but sadly it just ends right there.\n\nJust getting one, mediocre, story, no real choices, not getting the game the tags promise. All in all I think one of the other reviews is right, this "game" looks more like a test for a certain engine then a real game.\n\nUnless the makers come with some huge patch which adds a ton of content I would almost call this a fraud.\n\nDefinatly not worth it's price, and it's a shame really, because their was potential.","October 24, 2014","false","3.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

But, overall it was a bit of a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting some story-rich plot anything spectacular. I can appreciate fluff for what it is. I enjoy guilty pleasure gaming from time to time just for the sheer entertainment value. But, this game was just too lacking in nearly every way for me.\n\nThe art is well drawn, and the characters are beautiful--but doesn't have much in terms of actual character design. Most characters have one, or maybe two expressions. If you look at each character side by side, there is barely no distinguishing them aside from the color of the hair and clothes. I know the game celebrates big breasts and shiny butts, and there's nothing wrong with that--but if you're going to make it the focus of your game, why not add a little variety to the body types and facial features?\n\nYou can tell there is decent production value, but I really wish they would have used it to the fullest extent. Voice acting would have been a great touch, and might have added a little depth to the characters. More music would have been great too, especially without voices, but there seems to only be two or so songs. Choices would have also been worthwhile, so be warned if you enjoy your visual novels with lots of options and different routes or endings. This game has none, which is a shame considering the whole "harem" style of it. There is a single choice given in the entirety of the game, near the end...and no, it doesn't really have an effect on the plot at all. This is more of a kinetic novel, which is simply a story played out for you with little or no interaction on your part. Which would have been fine, if only the story were better.\n\n","January 28, 2015","false","2.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Do not buy, even if you get it for a buck.\n\nI bought it out of curiosity in the Steam sale because I heard that it was about a judoka and I like martial arts stories. I had assumed it would be some sort of choose your own adventure type of story... but it ended up being a completely linear sequence of typo-laden text with horrible writing, repeated images, and little in the way of discernable plot.\n\nAgain, making this clear to anyone who might be poised to buy this: There are no choices. There is little story. There is no dialogue. Spend your money on a good comic book with martial arts themes, like "Lone Wolf & Cub", "Vagabond" etc if you're after what I was.\n\nApparently I have '0 minutes on record' even though I played through this whole trainwreck.

A game requires some level of decision making to it throughout the whole game, or even in the case of the quick time event, would require you atleast push something to cause or prevent a particular outcome.\n\nThis is just a etchi/hentai style novel with music and character images which fade in and out as the characters "walk" in and out of the scenes.\n\nThe plotline is kind meh, but if we take a look at most hentai out there, they can be a good deal worse, so I'll give it a pass in this category for now; even if I don't care a lot for some of the dialogue out of the protagonist (whom your supposedly viewing everything from his point of view).\n\nHowever, what is unforgiveable is the constant rehashing of the same pose for the same character for everything, I understand there is a limit to how much artwork you can get done, but when a person changes facial expressions/moods, they tend to also change stance as well to better emote that emotion.  Even on the store page you can blatantly see the sword girl has that same positioning between her regular image and when she wears a kimono (which lacks the sword entirely) and thus looks awkward.  Even hentai of the manga variarity get that bit right.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are a few moments where they "change it up" but those moments tend to be the stuff that are a still image all together, and only on the moments that are suppose to show the near if not complete nudity of the girl they are currently focusing on.  You spend about 15 minutes (if your reading the dialogue and viewing the images at the same time) with the standardized and boring fade in and out character settings, and maybe 2 to 4 minutes on only one of these still images (also if you still read the dialogue).\n\nIs this worth $10? No. No its not.\n\nHowever if it goes on sale for a particularly cheap price (half or less), then maybe it will be worth the price; otherwise there are plenty of free places to get good hentai out there, or if your into visual novels, theres also some good free visual novels out there as well.\n\nAlso, minor issues I've noticed here and there as far as the dialogue is concerned: there is atleast one or two typos in the first fourth of the novel. Not a big deal since I still could disern what was intended to be said, and also usually you'd want this sort of thing for the visuals alone.","October 30, 2014","false","2.6"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

I did however enjoy the story and hope for more to come in the future but with a bit more conideration on the gaming aspect of it. My complaints for this was the price and what it actualy was. $10 is a bit over priced cause its only replay value is the equvalent of reading a manga again. In the future i hope they acutaly draw out more scenes and actually add more stances and posses for the characters and their emotions. This visual novel lacks alot but its got a good story.

I also liked the background music, never did I find it disrupting and most of the time it was appropriatefor the situation, I did find there wasn't too much different scores...\n\nthe dialogue was mostly funny and there were some good moments (not spoiling anything here since... well... it's so short everthing I spoil will be a major spoiler...).\n\nbut the "This game includes nudity and explicit sexual dialog." warning you get is well~ barely applicable. there were some moments but nothing really too much.\n\nAs for the €10,- price tag, It's a bit much for the amount of time you get to spend with the VN, one run through on auto play will take you around 4h, default settings. if you are a fast reader you'll finish it in half time most likely. I would recommend to buy it in a sale.\n\n\nI really enjoyed the game, but I wish there was more replayability, the lack of choices and the amount of time you can spend with the game is just too little.\nOn the other hand, I really enjoyed the art, the music and the dialogue.\nIn the end I will recommend the game, but I also would recommend to wait untill Sakura Spirit is being discounted for at least 50% or more.","November 21, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I would have liked to have seen mulitple choices that would lead to different routes with the romantic interests in the game, each having a unique ending.\n\nI also want to add there's no nudity or explicit sexual dialog in this game contrary to what steam says, there is some revealing scenes with major side boob but that's as much as you get. The sexual dialog is hinted at in jokes or innuendo, but nothing explicit or graphic is discussed in the game's dialog.\n\nIf you can get this game for less than 50% off I say give it a try...if for nothing else, the game cards will put around $2.00+ back into your steam wallet if sold on the market. If you enjoy the harem comedy genre of anime/manga, you will enjoy Sakura Spirit...the story is decent and the artwork is high quality.","December 4, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

So it is not completely satisfying.\n- There are some plotholes and weird "choices"/"thinking" of the main character which seems to be out of character.\n- There is only one choice of the game in nearly the end of the game and even though I haven't explored the other choice, then I'm pretty sure that it has no consequences at all in the end. I would have loved to be choices and that you would be able to pick your favourite girl.\n\nThe pro:\n- The characters are pretty and welldrawn, and they even came up(or tried) with an explanation for why the girls always wore the same looking clothing!\n- There isn't some devastating plotholes, just some small ones which you overlook (beause of the "chests") or only will annoy you for a bit.\n- For me, I used this game as a little break from studies, so I didn't mind that the story were simple and just relied mostly on the cuteness of the girls and of course lack of clothing without totally showing.\n- There were characterdevelopment, you can always argue how much, but especially the girls, not really the main character ^^\n- I did indeed enjoy the music, it didn't became annoying for me ^^\n\n\nSo again if you just want to have an little ecchi visual novel without any really intellektuel or great story, but just a little cute one, then this is for you ^^","January 1","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This is not an RPG, there is only 1 point at which you may select from multiple dialog options, and regardless of what you pick the ending will be that same. This dialog option will effect the next few scenes of the novel, but it will reconnect with the other option's path after a short time. This plot isn't the best quality about this game, its quite generic and predictable. The highlight of this game would be the the high quality artworks. This game has a lot of nudity and partial nudity, so play at your own eyes expense. I reccomend this game only because it is accurately advertised with the videos you find on the store page, I would not recommend actually playing this game unless what you're looking for is a cheaply put together story with high quality perverted images. I personally enjoyed this game because i didn't think the game makers would actually take the sex jokes and perversion as far as they did, so it has no replayability for me since its no longer a surprise, but was interesting in the first playthrough.","October 1, 2014","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you don't like anime or dramas, this game probably isn't for you. I had the original game (Non HD) for some time, but only finished one or two senerios. After buying the HD version on steam and investing quite some time into it, I can garuntee that you will love this game.\n\nPros:\n-Absolutely stunning soundtrack\n-Well written and flesh out characters. There isn't a single main or side character that has an inconsistency or hole in their story\n-Long and touching routes (you will be brought to tears)\n-At least one of these senerios is relatable to your everyday life.\n\nCons:\n-The art style. People seem to hate the art style. I think it grows on you as you play, but I didn't care for it originally.\n-Length. At times there is a lot of filler text that isn't important to story, and makes routes take so much time. I found myself skipping a lot to get to the important bits.\n\nAll in all this game is completely worth the price, as it will open your eyes and immerse you in a world where you can't control your emotions, they control you.","February 3","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This is not an RPG, there is only 1 point at which you may select from multiple dialog options, and regardless of what you pick the ending will be that same. This dialog option will effect the next few scenes of the novel, but it will reconnect with the other option's path after a short time. This plot isn't the best quality about this game, its quite generic and predictable. The highlight of this game would be the the high quality artworks. This game has a lot of nudity and partial nudity, so play at your own eyes expense. I reccomend this game only because it is accurately advertised with the videos you find on the store page, I would not recommend actually playing this game unless what you're looking for is a cheaply put together story with high quality perverted images. I personally enjoyed this game because i didn't think the game makers would actually take the sex jokes and perversion as far as they did, so it has no replayability for me since its no longer a surprise, but was interesting in the first playthrough.","October 1, 2014","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So it is not completely satisfying.\n- There are some plotholes and weird "choices"/"thinking" of the main character which seems to be out of character.\n- There is only one choice of the game in nearly the end of the game and even though I haven't explored the other choice, then I'm pretty sure that it has no consequences at all in the end. I would have loved to be choices and that you would be able to pick your favourite girl.\n\nThe pro:\n- The characters are pretty and welldrawn, and they even came up(or tried) with an explanation for why the girls always wore the same looking clothing!\n- There isn't some devastating plotholes, just some small ones which you overlook (beause of the "chests") or only will annoy you for a bit.\n- For me, I used this game as a little break from studies, so I didn't mind that the story were simple and just relied mostly on the cuteness of the girls and of course lack of clothing without totally showing.\n- There were characterdevelopment, you can always argue how much, but especially the girls, not really the main character ^^\n- I did indeed enjoy the music, it didn't became annoying for me ^^\n\n\nSo again if you just want to have an little ecchi visual novel without any really intellektuel or great story, but just a little cute one, then this is for you ^^","January 1","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Sakura Spirit is a visual novel, an eroge but not hentai. For something like this to be on Steam, its kind of a shock.\n\nBasically, the story is typical anime scenario. Guy gets transported somewhere, ends up getting involved with whatever's going on and also 'bonding' with the females who all happen to be 'abundant' in the chest compartment, even the young one. But surprise, surprise, I actually found the story funny. Cliched at some points, but still enough to make me chuckle here and there. The art looks nice and there's plenty of fanservice.......you might not want to read this when people are around.\n\nBut this is Steam, a video game platform. Despite being alright, I only recommend this should it go on a sale. Its quite cheap actually, but you probably wouldn't want to pay full-price just to read something. Otherwise, Sakura Spirit is good, I like it enough.","September 25, 2014","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

Tons of fan service for sure. The story is a bit short but a good read and a great way to blow time away. Only negative thing I have about this is the one choice you have and a few minor "engrish" spelling. Other then that, enjoy looking at teasing images of girls.","July 22, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

About 1.3 hours into the game, I got to make a decision.\nFrom this point on, it seems I might even have more choices to make. But Ye Gods, that was a long introduction sequence...

It's a visual novel. A visual novel that is not so secretly leaning on the visual side of things. I don't want to tell you much about the story, as that's the entire thing. There's only one spot where this resembles a game. This is where you can make a choice. The choice then changes one section of the game before going back into the linear story. You really just click during this game. That's the extent of gameplay. No animations, no movement, not really any choices. It's not a game, but... well it's called a game on here so... that's why I have to make this absolutely clear up front. This is a bad game and is not recommended for playing as a game.\n\nThat being said, I'd like to go into my horrible reasons on why I made this a recommendation. I'm a lonely person, I find the girls in this game to be drawn quite attractively, and there's boobs in it. No nudity, just lots of suggestive clothing, positions, and situations. Basically, to be perfectly blunt, it's fap bait. You know that if you're willing to pay ten bucks from what you've seen and heard of this game, you're doing it for that. I certainly wanted it for that very reason. I'm not ashamed of it... even if it is pretty pathetic. All I'm saying here is... if you're looking for a decent time doing your business and you don't want to go off into potentially virus filled sites... or just Google image searches... then this is a fine purchase to make. Just don't be fooled. You're not getting a game or a particularly engaging story... you're getting still images of hot anime girls that have a little personality. That's about it.\n\nConsidering the price, the fact that it's not even a game but pretending to be one on here, and the lack of depth, I have to rate it 2/10. If there weren't the girls in it... it'd probably be a 1. (This is the problem with the yes or no on recommendations... I have to make the call on ultimately one or the other and stuff like THIS happens... I'm sorry)","January 7, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It works best when you need to play all the "branches  of the story tree" in order to truly figure out what is going on. When the game involve sexy girls and romance, being able to romance the one you like is also a major incentive to play a game like this.\n\nBut there is none of that in Sakura Spirit. Just one path in which you interact a bit with all the girls, but can't choose one.

My hopes is that the developers will use critiques like those and the money they earned in order to remaster the game, by adding choices and girl-specific events.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ahobaka/recommended/313740/","Ahobaka","Ahobaka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ahobaka/","216 products in account","Not really sure what to make of this game. I went in expecting more of a full game, but got something more akin to a demo version.\n\nThe game drew me in with the artwork and I was hoping for some interesting choices or paths down the storyline. But there's literally only one option and all it changes is what Gallery CG you unlock. The ending it results in is still the same, no matter what choice you make.\n\nIt's clear that the devs want to make more out of this, going by the ending card message. Here's to hope that they improve on what they have and add some more meat to the whole game, because right now it's looking pretty slim.\n\nAs I said before, the artwork is pretty good. Although the design is very hit or miss on the characters, Tsuyuri standing out the most, not matching any of the others in any way or form. The cast of "villains" is just a case of copy/paste with differently coloured hair and eyes.\n\nStorywise it's quite lacking. The background story is way too short and thin, you don't know anything about the main character apart from him being a "Rising Judo Star" and see traces of him being a stuttering and silly carbon copy of most bland animé MC's with a little dash of Gary Stu over him. The girl cast is nice, but you hardly get to know them in the short time that you get to play (aka: read) the game. Just when you get to the point that you start to see some development, it ends.\n\nThen there's the writing. Sentences have very stiff structure, some come out almost as if they were translated literally from Japanese even though the game is English from the start. Some sentences have several spelling errors and grammar issues. The main writer also seems to have a fetish for the word "seemingly". So the game could do with some serious quality checking, including a couple of editors and proof readers before getting released.\n\nSo in short, would I recommend this game for VN / Eroge fans? Not really. You'll get some light fanservice, nothing overly lewd. The writing is subpar and the ending way too quick with nothing really major in terms of choices. I have to give it to the devs for the art though, for being their first (?) game it is quite well done. But other than that this doesn't really go to any great lenghts to improve on the genre.","July 14, 2014","false","6.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Voiceless, generic japanese style music and with its graphics meant to obviously attract the male (teenager aged) audience, I was rather bored with it within minutes of playing.\n\nThis is not to say that this is a bad visual novel, as I'm likely spoiled by visual novels that had actual (usually complicated) plot, multiple paths and endings, so take this review from a 30-ish year old man with a grain of salt. While bland for me, it's several steps above my tolerance levels compared to the official Baldur's Gate novel.\n\n...Before anyone complains, I said the official NOVEL of it, not the game. There's a difference, look it up.\n\nAnyways, As far as I can tell, this is likely the developers first game ever from my searches on the internet, so it can somewhat explain why the game is bland to me. Could the developer improve? Only if he or she is willing to be, so I can only hope so.","December 9, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not really worth the asking price. If price was lowered to 2-3 dollars it would be worth it. I do recommend the game but wish that there was more to do with the village and not completely about the fighting or atleast around Miyo and stuff.

This means their are really no choices to be made that effect the outcome or change the events* , you are here to read the story and enjoy the artwork.\n*(Technically there is one choice that effects which group of girls you spend time with at the festival near the end of the game but it has no impact on the actual story and the game can be saved before making this choice and you can quickly replay the different scenes before it carries on as normal)\n\n\nThe story involves a young rising Judo star, nervous about a big match coming up, who whilst praying at a supposedly magical shrine to calm his nerves is whisked away to another world. Here he meets two female fox spirits who are at odds with a nearby village and the young female warriors of said village. The young man must help both groups come to understand one another whilst finding a way back home and preventing the village from being attacked by other spirits.\n\nWhen it comes down to it the story is tired and predictable, however the writing and descriptions are very good, and these almost make up for the lacklustre plot. Likewise each of the female characters are pretty much your standard animé stereotypes and although there are a few flashes of deeper character these never really develop much or are forgotten once they start fawning over the main character...which they all do of course. Sadly very little is done with the characters from the normal world that are introduced.\n\nThis is a "fan-service" VN designed to titillate male players, and there is nothing wrong with that and the game does this well. however there is very little on offer for anyone else The artwork and backgrounds are good although lacking variety and the occasional CG image of a scene (usually of the girls in "fan-service" poses) are all very well drawn. The music is ok, a few tracks repeated for different types of scenes but non of them are particularly unpleasant...the real downside is that there doesn’t seem to be any voice work.\n\nIt took about two and a half hours to finish, that includes going back and seeing the festival with both groups, there isn't really any replayablitiy (my total playtime includes the time for mining trading cards). At full price this is a difficult product to recommend however if it's on sale, I’ve certainly read/played worse VNs.\n\nQuick Summary:-\n+ "Fan-Service"\n+ Well written dialogue and descriptions\n+ Funny\n+ Nice Artwork\n- Predictable/Stereotypical Characters/Plot\n- Linear\n- Short with no Replayability","January 21, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
