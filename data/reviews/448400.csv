I expect some to be just okay with maybe one or two really making the bundle worth it.  I will be rating them as I play them.\n\nKronville: Stolen Dreams\n\nFun Factor 3/5\nGraphics 3/5\nLevel of Challenge 3/5\nStoryline 3/5\n\nOverall a average okay game. The graphics are decent for an older game on a newer PC with widescreen. I find the items and closing windows lags a bit (the items could be more mouse sensitive). So the first one I could take or leave really. Only played it less than an hour and I got bored.\n\nCruel Games: Red Ridinghood\n\nFun Factor 3/5\nGraphics 3/5\nLevel of Challenge 2/5\nStoryline 3/5\n\n* No travel map or special hidden objects. Good to pass an afternoon if you have a couple hours to kill. I found the challenges and puzzles in this one to be pretty easy, maybe to easy.\n\nThe Other Side-Tower of Souls\n\nFun Factor 4/5\nGraphics 5/5\nLevel of Challenge 4/5\nStoryline 4/5\n\nI actually really liked this one. It had cool weird artwork and good voice overs. The best one in the bundle to date!\n\nPanopticon-Path of Reflections\n\nFun Factor 1/5\nGraphics 1/5\nLevel of Challenge 1/5\nStoryline 1/5\n\nWorst one so far. The graphics are so flat and dull and the characters are in the style of old 3d. Only played 15 minutes and turned this one off.\n\nThe Lake House-Children of Silence\n\nFun Factor  5/5\nGraphics 4/5\nLevel of Challenge 4/5\nStoryline 5/5\n\nReally liked this one. I found the story pretty good and the atmosphere a bit darker. Also there is a bonus chapter in this game!\n\nMexicana-Deadly Holiday\n\nFun Factor 5/5\nGraphics 5/5\nLevel of Challenge 4/5\nStoryline 5/5\n\nOne of the best games of the pack. Very unique artwork and a diffrent approach to game play. I really am enjoying this game out of the bunch. Also it has a travel map too!","March 17","true","12.4"," 93 of 102 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","93","102","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/448400/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","I wrote a review too long for Steam. I cut the stories (and some less important parts), so, check the store page to read them.\n\nHidden Object Bundle 6 in 1 is the new pack from Alawar to discover the genre. So, are the games worthy of your wallet?\n\nKronville\n\nWhile the plot was initially interesting, I found myself a little lost with new elements thrown. However, what's interesting in this game is that the concept of using dreams to solve the mystery is well used. Here, fairy tales are used and villains are the man haunting the sleep of the children.\n\nThe gameplay is standard. However, contrary to most games of the genre, here, you have many alternatives for the hidden objects scenes. And you have even to interact in them before getting the list of words or shapes! My only problem are the puzzles: many of them are difficult to understand, even when looking the help. I ended up to skip the most of them, as they frustrated me faster than usual.\n\nThe graphics are good and sad at the same time: only the dreams are colorful, even in the drama they're representing. Kronville seems so without life, without any light... But that's why you're thinking that there is an evil entity roaming in it, a paranormal one. The soundtrack is correct too.\n\nPanopticon\n\nThe plot is well written: you have some interesting twists and you don't have any plotholes. Besides, I must admit that I'm quite impressed with it. I was in reality expecting an average game, don't ask me why I was convinced that it would be a disaster.\n\nThe gameplay is the standard one. However, the game come with two difficulties. But it will not change the easiness of the hidden objects list or the puzzles. It means that you don't get frustrated during the game for these parts. It doesn't mean that the rest is flowing like that: sometimes, some actions, despite having the right items, can't be done before going elsewhere. The inventory, once locked, can be unlocked because you misclicked, which is annoying (the button is in the middle, that's why many misclicks can happen when you want to go back).\n\nThe journey through different worlds is also a nice one: everything is colorful. While I love darker hidden objects, I'm also sensible to those showing me a magical path. The graphics are nice, however, I liked less the fact that the characters looked like they're not belonging to the scenes. The soundtrack was also very pleasant.\n\nPanopticon itself can justify to buy the bundle.\n\nCruel Games\n\nThe game has an interesting plot: usually, fairy tales HO games are set in a fantasy world or in dreams or are the subject in themselves. Here, Red Riding Hood is in a modern era, with a killer you're trying to catch, by being a victim of him. The twist at the end is also shocking, though I understood where it was heading in the last scene, by looking closely at some details.\n\nIf you read the gameplay passages above, you'll know that nothing is new: puzzles, list of items to find... Everything is very easy, however, some items or interesting areas aren't really clicking in your head: they're really near the wolf head, serving as hint. So, your sight is actually set on it instead of what's around.\n\nAs the time is our present days, you think that you'll visit normal locations. However, between an abandoned casino hotel and a cemetary, the only modern locations are the bar, gas station, motel and docks. Everything is set during the night, with a persistent rain. However, the serial killer is also fan of dummies: you'll find them a lot in the game, impersonating real people (you think someone is in the motel room, but it's a wooden doll) for example. The soundtrack is also fitting.\n\nCruel Games is also a nice game, which means that already, half of the bundle is enjoyable.\n\nLake House\n\nThe plot could have been better if it wasn't spoiled early. Indeed, the only alive person you meet at first is easily recognized. The only question that stays is your role in the whole story. I must say that I regretted that move. However, the rest is pretty much interesting, like the fact that key moments from the past are on microfilms and are seen thanks to a projector.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty classic - however, the hidden objects scenes aren't as easy as I thought, as I've played Lake House after the three mentionned above. Indeed, some objects are well hidden. As far for the puzzles, they're pretty normal and easy for the most of them.\n\nThe graphics are correct, though you don't stay as I've expected in the house: you visit the town around, deserted because of a persistent fog that appeared suddenly. Everything around seems creepy: dummies everywhere so that the only living being doesn't feel lonely, abandoned buildings, a woman that is appearing from nowhere. The soundtrack is correct as the voice actings.\n\nThe game is a collector's edition, meaning that you have a chapter bonus where you're finally the woman and where you need to go back to the house to destroy the mask. Once played, you'll unlock bonus: videos, concept arts and wallpapers.\n\nWhile I didn't enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed the three before, Lake House isn't disappointing.\n\nThe Other Side\n\nI was expecting this game to be a tale into a fantasy world, given the fact that the cat is shown on the header. However, reading the synopsys made me wonder where it was headed. The story isn't really a strengh here. However, the cat is probably the best feature. Indeed, while he's kinda ironic, he always has something to say AND he's full of hints towards what you should do. Where I was expecting him to be boring and annoying, I found him very funny.\n\nThe game comes with two endings and with two difficulties. However, it could have been a collector's edition because you have a shop where you buy clothes, glasses or jewelry for the cat, with interesting bonus tied to them (-25% of time for charging hint for example). You have to find cat paw prints in the hidden objects scenes or in the levels, there are more than 100. Also, you have ingame achievements.\n\nThe graphics are quite good: they're not creepy despite the story but they're colorful. As for the soundtrack, it's correct.\n\nHowever, the fact that the game wanted me to install something to play it isn't really something I liked. I refused it and it didn't change anything in the game. Also, when I did a right click, I discovered that it was a flash game.\n\nDespite that, The Other Side: Tower of Souls is a good surprise.\n\nMexicana\n\nThe story didn't disappoint me though I didn't expect the girl to be part of this special world. Besides, I loved the fact that they used a celebration elsewhere than in USA as the beginning. It's a nice way to discover some traditions for this special day.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's the standard one. Indeed, between puzzles and hidden objects scenes, you don't have anything new, even if you have to search for pages of a codex. Everything is well-balanced.\n\nFor the graphics, they're really nice: the afterworld is colorful, without real sadness or creepy location in it. I loved also the cutscenes presenting every character. It reminded me of Borderlands. As for the soundtrack, it was really enjoyable. I loved the fact that it was an ambiance that sticked to the mexican celebration or at least, in a latino style.\n\nSeriously, Mexicana didn't disappoint me. It was a really good game, I've spent an agreable moment with it, so I'm very happy to see that this bundle of 6 games was a bundle of joy.\n\nConclusion\n\nI was relieved to see that none of the game were a joke. Sure, they're not all of the same quality but the difference is tiny. Alawar made a nice pick for the bundle. For the price, it's a very nice surprise here. Right now, given the fact that none of the games are released yet on Steam, go for it. Hours spent in it will be very enjoyable.","March 25","true","17.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/recommended/448400/","shiaakuma","shiaakuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/","701 products in account","This bundle of six hidden object games is well worth the asking price.\n\nThe games vary in quality but each has an interesting plot and some unique elements that make them really good plays.  It seemed to me to be a well chosen selection of different plots and mechanics.  In terms of length, each game is pretty standard for the genre (running at an average of about 3 hours each).  None of the six have any really egregious or annoying aspects to deal with and are pretty entertaining.\n\nSo far, I've played five of the six games without any issues in terms of errors, bugs, or inability to load (a problem that was prevalent for some people in the similar 5-in-1 bundle).  So if you have any concerns about loading and playing these, I don't think you have anything to worry about.\n\nSo without digging deeply into each individual game, at an average of $2 per game at full bundle price, I would highly recommend this to any fan of the HO genre.  It is 100% worth the full price for the number and length of the games.\n\nEDIT:  The original review was made after playing five of the six games, so naturally the sixth one had to give me some trouble.  The game doesn't agree with high-res, but if you lock the game to a lower resolution there's no trouble.  This last one (Mexicana) also happens to be my least favorite of the games for some reason, but it's not terrible even though the plot gets a little far out and the HO scenes aren't as crisp as the others.","April 2","true","25.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Alawar Entertainment have concocted an interesting and well-priced bundle for you to enjoy. Personally, I own a good collection of this genre of game and I enjoy most of them. So far, I have played four of the six games in this bundle and have actually finished two of them. If you are used to this genre, it will take you between 4 to 6 hours to play a game from start to finish.\n\nOf the four games that I played, 2 stand out of the pack for me. The first one is The Lake House. I really like the story of this game and the puzzles are very good to.\n\nThe second one is Mexicana: Deadly Holiday. The artwork is excellent and the puzzles are quite challenging.\n\nKronville: Stolen Dreams is a bit on the easy side in regards to the puzzles. Still enjoyable but fairly easy.\n\nPanopticon: Path of reflection is fairly easy too. Interesting story in the milieu of magic and illusion.\n\nI have not tried Cruel Games and The Other Side. I will update my review when I have.\n\nIt is very difficult to rate this due to the fact that it is a bundle so I will give this bundle the following after playing four of the six games.\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
