If you haven't seen this game before, well, it's not as famous as Jagged Alliance or Incubation, but it was very good at given time. It costs little and there are coupons up to 90% - almost to cost of sip of water.\n\nPro: Good tactics of small squad (3-5 members) based on fair balance and well-made short maps. Note that it's a close combat game, there are no gauss rifle to solve the problem from distance. You'll need to count every shot and use cold steel in every fight. It feels like survival games like resident evil 2&3, but with turn-based battle system.\n\nCons: in year 2014 RE2-styled product look awful. Gorky 17 is playable, but some of new gamers might have their eyes bleed from first sight. The story, especially basic one (english version), is vague at its best, and klükva in general. AI is not that good, some of us will overcome this game easily.\n\nAll in all, it's a fair 7.5/10 in my line. I'd give it more, but good balance was made out of killed realism.\n\nPS: It almost hit 15 years age mark! That means you can run it on very dull config! But, no matter how good is your CPU and GPU, there will be 640x480 resolution and damn large pixels. It runs on Win7 with no trouble at all, just pick the right stroke on videoconfig before starting the game.\n\nPS for russians: Game contains right translation (Made by Snowball studio - not Goblin's Gorky18). So you have two games in one: for NATO or for good old Specnaz, since translation made a big difference in all dialogs in game.","March 10, 2014","true","9.8"," 127 of 145 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","127","145","5","2"

NATO sends the whole army of four soldiers into the city and loses contact with them. Then they send another three - a Canadian, a Pole and a French. Sounds like a good mix for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke.\n\nInstead, as player finds out, it is a beginning of a sinister story set in a devastated city which has been abandoned by human beings... but strange creatures lurk in the shadows and player faces them constantly in turn based combat. With exception of the end game and some silly boss fights, the game offers a challenge and you will often count every bullet as they are hard to come by. The graphic and art design are amazing when it comes to surroundings, the creatures, however, are of mixed quality. During the gameplay there is a very atmospheric music which fits the mood perfectly, although one could wish for more tracks.\n\nOverall, the game is great if you enjoy gloomy settings and even more so if you are a fan of tactical games. For five euro it's a must-buy, so get it on Steam sales at least. Get it and play it!","October 5, 2013","true","12.2"," 65 of 75 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","65","75","12","3"

Minor glitches appear, a gamebreaking one in the third last fight which makes completing the game tricky. The game has aged a little poorly and you may find yourself rolling your eyes when it comes to the voice-acting, cutscenes will stutter and blink, and creature designs suffer from the poor graphic quality.

So about the game. First of all i dont care about graphics so my review will be positive.\nGorky 17 is the game in which you must to think in every battle and especially in begining you must save ammo as much as you can. I saved too much and in the end had plenty of ammo. And you must to choose the best route how to complete stage.\nI liked how the surroundings of maps was drawed and i liked the story and characters too.\nSo buy this if you like turn based strategy, rpg and dont care about graphics.

It has a great atmosphere even with its outdated resolution. The music is great and to me the background graphics still have their quality. The voice-acting is pretty bad but tolerable, nothing too distracting. The story is nothing special but it does manage to keep you interested and immersed. I also like the cutscenes used to introduce the boss enemies.\n\nThe good thing about the gameplay is that it really needs you to think about your strategy. You'll almost always be short on ammunition and meet new enemies which require different tactics. The boss battles can be frustrating, but quite satisfying when you manage to get a victory.\n\nGet it, especially when it's on sale (which it is very often).","April 22, 2014","true","7.2"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

Be sure that the graphics are dated, but this is not the reason you play this game.\nThe Game Centers around a NATO Command team that tries to uncover the mystery of the disappearance of another group.\n\nWhile uncovering its secrets you roam a city that was designed with attention to detail and encounter enemies at different points of the map. There is a large variability of enemies and cool boss enemies.\n\nThe battles are faught in a round-based fashion, which is the aspect that makes this game so dear to my heart. Your group members (that change during the game based on its story) gain experience with the weapons they use increasing their effectiveness. They also level up and you can influence their attributes (like Luck, Accuracy, Chance of Coutner Attacks etc).\n\nThe maps are fight layed out using squares and usually offer some possibilities to retreat from enemies so that you are not standing too tight. They often also offer coverage or objects like explosives that can be used to your advantage.\n\nThe game is sometimes quite challanging because ammo can not be found in aboundance, so tactical thinking and choice of weapon is a must.\n\nIn conclusion I have to say that I can only warmly recomment this game to anyone who likes old school tactical RPGs and is not too put-off by the dated graphics.","November 25, 2013","true","14.1"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedKage/recommended/253920/","RedKage","RedShadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RedKage/","526 products in account","Gorky 17 (Odium in North America) is a turn by turn strategy game.\n\nYou will start with 3 guys from NATO and your objective is to rescue another team (Group 1) that HQ has lost communication with. The city is full of monsters and that's the game's main attraction: wasting them. As you can guess, the game's story is average.\n\nThe voice acting is okay. Dialogs are sometimes "funny" even though most of them are cliché, as are the characters. The team boss is Canadian and tries to help people and goes right to the point. Another guy is Polish, has a funny broken English and he wants to blast everything. And the last dude is French and is -- of course -- an unbelievable wimp. Well... all of this is not that great either.\n\nDuring the combat phase, you will have trouble to see the tiles as they are transparent glowing green squares. It is also hard to visualize the opposition's move range as it has the same color and style. Also the overview is not isometric. Sometimes a weird camera angle prevents you from having a clear sight of what's going on. Crates and other stuff will block the view and those lovely glowing tiles. If you are not careful, you will end up clicking on the wrong tile and wasting a move. Or worse. In other words the combat phase is very clumsy.\n\nWhen you are not shooting stuff, you are exploring the map. Every time you will spot a glowing crate -- which contains supplies like medpacks, ammo, etc. -- there will be a battle nearby. There is pretty much one crate per battle. Always. Whether the battle starts when approaching it or right after you emptied its content and went through a door or something nearby, a battle event occurs. Oh yeah I forgot: battles are scripted. There are no random encounters.\n\nDuring this epic adventure, various people will join your team. It's all fine and all. Except that when they have to leave your awesome NATO team because they… uh feel like it or just because they die or whatever, they will simply disappear... along with all the stuff you gave them! Say goodbye to the shiny armor, handgun, precious ammo, etc. The inventory is NOT transferred to one of your guys. Save often, so that when they leave you can load a previous save, and empty their inventory.\n\nBut this is quite a problem as the ammo is scarce. The game is quite hard if you use firearms. The limited amount of ammo pushes you to use melee weapons. At first you won't have a choice but to shoot creeps. However, a taser and a tranq gun will help you freeze those turds for a couple of turns while you beat the sht out of 'em.\n\nThe taser among other weapons like the flamethrower, have unlimited "ammo". But, they have a cool down: like 3 turns to fire/shoot again. That means that when two of your goons have a taser or such other weapon, you will be able to keep a monster “tranquilized” forever. Just wait for the cool down to be over to tase the mofo again with the other guy.\n\nSo... basically a battle goes like this: analyze which scum to tase first, rush him with all of your guys, and melee him like a bunch of hooligans. Crowbar, baseball bat, axe. Yeah. The battles are hence, not very interesting. However there are some cool "weapons" like calling for an airstrike, an electric beam, and all kind of other crazy tools.\n\nLet’s talk about bugs now. I had an inventory bug were a key item disappeared between saves. I had to restart the game as I couldn’t open a freaking door without it. Also the game cannot start on modern computer due to the old graphic "engine" -- if we can call it that way. However, fear not (or not that much) as there are a few different gorky17.exe builds in the game folder that you can try. Copy/paste/overwrite the original .exe with one of them and try to run the game. Disabling the hardware zoom is however pretty much always recommended.\n\nOn an old computer with WinXP and a crappy graphic card that has barely 3D acceleration, I had no problem running the game. It was flawless. However Win 8.1 x64 + GeForce GTX 770 the game crashed. Using the software only build + choosing software renderer was making the game super freaking slow. Even with my quad core i7 4770k. So I was back to my WinXP.\n\nAll in all I must have spent 10 to 15 hours of gameplay. Not that bad. But the overall experience was barely average. I’m hesitating whether thumbing this down or not. I had fun with this game. I wasn’t playing that seriously anyway and still ended up with shtton of ammo.\nHmmm… lets thumb it up.","May 14, 2014","true","19.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

All it has from RPG is an ability to increase your soldiers skills.\nIt is more like Shadowrun Returns, but darker and with "less talking more shooting" kind of gameplay.\n\nI wish they did sequels in the same way, because the game is just awesome.","March 31, 2015","true","8.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The only problem is, is to get it to run "normally". Whith that I mean, that the characters might look like they have been cut out from cardboard by stevie wonder.\n\nIf you find the game to hard, there is a tactic you can use which involves positioning your characters around the enemy. I can't remember the tactic fully...sorry...but if you get the hang of the combat mechanics you might find out the tactic easily...\n\nDo yourself a favour If you're a sci-fi horror fan who appreciates some tactics in combat, get this one to work and play it.\n\nSo.... back to my blockbuster movie: Dinocroc vs. Supergator ...\n\n\n","May 13","true","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

So you can guess what to expect.\nNow to the main point, the game is HARD, very HARD, i mean at least the first time you do it, not knowing when combats happens, sparing any ammo you can, any bandage.. It's like a non stop boss fight (with an opening movie each time) and you're always on the breach, so this and the overall difficulty, the fact that 1 knockdown and its game over, is the good point.\nThe bad point is technically, the  camera make this even harder in the bad way, you will often shoot your teamates miss you target or run when you dont want to, without any possibility to cancel, and finally flying monster do not appear on the ground with any shadow or anything, making them awfully hard to deal with.\nAs i list the default, one more would be the ia.. the ia is actually in some aspect too good. I should film a combat with humanoids, its hillarious, its like playing chest with computer, you cant touch them, except if you sacrifice something.\n\nSo in the end, great "little" game, took me almost 20h in a row, when i only wanted to give try.  9/10, no wait.. for 50ct 10/10","March 29","true","20.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Imagine Resident Evil 1 with combat system from Incubation. The atmosphere of the abandoned city is great and resembles STALKER series somehow, the turn-based combat is fun and varied with lots of status effect that can be inflicted on enemies. There are some easy puzzles and even some deegree of nonlinearity to the plot (one of the secondary characters can be saved or not, while the other one is killed no matter what you do). The leveling up system is lacking and I didn't see any difference when dumping points into a skill, but it's probably the only bad thing I can say about the game.\n\nI'd like to remember what made the game popular in Russia at the time of the release. Russian version was more of an adaptation than translation - they changed a lot of names and plot details. For example, the main character trio became Russian, Ukrainian and Estonian who serve in Russian MES (Ministry of Emergency Situations). And then there was an official "funny" translation named Gorky-18, where they changed all the names and all the plot again, now adding a lot of humor of varying quality.\n\nIt is still fondly remembered as one of the first foreign games officially published in Russia. It was published in jewel cases without the manual (which was new for the time) and the retail price was equal or cheaper than the pirated CDs. There was no way bigger companies would agree to such terms and such a low profit, so the big hits of the time like Quake 2 or Half-life weren't published in Russia (though they were pirated a lot). We could get aquainted with some lesser-known games instead, and sometimes they turned to be just great, such is Gorky 17.","October 25, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When buying it, do expect it.\n\nAs for the game itself. Back when it was released in 1999 it was definitely a hit, however it has aged rather bad. The 3D graphics are clearly outdated - low res textures, low poly models, etc. Still, the general crudeness of the game somehow appealed to me so I decided to play it and finished it afterall.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay itself is extremely dull. Once you get the hang of all of the game mechanics the game's only about fighting a vicious, unforgiving AI, which is rather easy to predict. Boss fights are oversimplified and often boil down to blocking/stunning the boss and hammering him/her down with every weapon available. The final boss fight is a complete joke and is probably the easiest of them all.\n\nFinally, I was greatly disappointed with the plot and depiction of characters. Once the Great Conspiracy is revealed, it turns out to be a huge load of bullocks. It doesn't even qualify for a Z grade movie. Also, two of the characters totally drove my gears - Jarek Ovitz and Slavsky. I'm of Polish descent and Ovitz is NOT a typical Polish surname, nor is Slavsky a typical Polish name. Polish people are depicted in Gorky17 as strong, yet dumb and supersticious. Also, they have Russian accents and speak very bad Polish. I know the game was probably low-budget, but that doesn't excuse a complete lack of research on Poland and Polish people.\n\nHonestly, I am super patient and that's the only reason I managed to complete the game. However, the game's not worth your time. There are other, better ones around.\n\n\n\n","September 9, 2014","false","15.9"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/recommended/253920/","tartrazine","Tartrazine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tartrazine/","1509 products in account","Worth it if you're a fan of the genre This is a weird Polish turn-based squad tactics game. The graphics and mood are both like the original Resident Evils - dark, but cheesy. The game does a good job of keeping you off balance, not knowing who to trust, or how to survive each new horror you come across. Each boss is unique, and every few battles you'll fight a new type of monster.\n\nCombat is a little weird. Weapons have distinct attack patterns - pistols can only be fired in four directions, while rifles can also be fired diagonally, etc. That restriction (and the weird camera angles) can make it difficult to make sure that you're on the right spot to be able to shoot an enemy, but you don't have to use all your movement at once, so you can adjust as needed. (I've seen videos of the original Polish version of the game where there's a visible grid in combat, but that seems to have been removed from the English version). Ammo (and healing items) are often scarce, but you also get some reusable weapons that can be used every few turns for free. Stupidly, this includes tasers that lets you stunlock some bosses (many are immune) to the point where they can't ever attack you or move.\n\nYou get to choose how your characters improve when they level up, but the choices are pretty basic. Increasing health is  mostly a waste because there's nothing that can one-shot you, and healing items just heal a fixed number instead of a percentage of your health. Max out accuracy for your shooters, reduce calmness for melee guys (so that they rage out and do bonus damage easier), and then go with either luck for bonus damage or improve your counter-attack chance. (Counter attacks are free actions, but you can't switch weapons or change your facing, so plan ahead. You can face your character by clicking on him). Make sure to save after every fight or event. There are some times when you blatantly should have been given a chance to reorganize your inventory but weren't, so just reload instead.\n\nIf this doesn't run properly in Windows 7, add it to the DEP list, use Windows 95/98 compatiblity mode, and use software rendering.\n\nThis game is very old and rough around the edges, but it often goes on sale for a dollar and it's easily worth that.","March 9, 2015","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The voice acting is terrible too, another plus for RE fans, adding to the camp, but the translation is pretty good, actually.\n\nThe battles are grid-based (you can turn the grid on and off with TAB.)

The game opens to a hideous menu with a ridiculously blinding light for a cursor and one of the ugliest fonts I have ever seen.\n\nThe options menu is minimal with the graphics options have 2 options neither of which is texture quality or resolution, despite these glaring issues I hit the play button and wait. The starting video is really bland but this pales in comparison to the voice acting once the game starts. The acting is ridiculously bad and the attempts at accents are even worse.\n\nAs for graphics they are PS1 graphics style which is unfortunately the ugliest period in gaming history, after listening to the opening dialogue i take 3 steps and a random battle begins the combat seems as though it would actually be fun, I manage to make 2 attacks before ending my turn, the enemy then hits me twice and the game crashes in spectacular fashion.\n\nI would avoid this title as all costs unless you have a fondness for PS1 graphics, bad voice acting and unstable games. If you do decide to play this game through for whatever reason I would suggest turning your sound off and just reading the subtitles.","November 5, 2013","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I'll give that a try later this week.\n\nTo start off, Gorky 17 looks like it has a decent premise behind it, the beginning is interesting and I was immediately sucked in the conflict at hand. The game is a turn based tactical rpg that feels similar to the original Fallout games. During my brief playtime I battled a fair amount, and I really had no idea what I was doing. There wasn't much of anything to help you learn how to battle or even how to equip your characters. I eventually figured it out but the lack of a tutorial is understandable with an older game, and I'm not going to fault it too much for it.\n\nHowever, that's not why I don't reccommend Gorky 17. Gorky 17, as you may find out, is quite old. very old in fact. If you have anything near a modern pc you might not even be able to play it. The game has color and texture issues, with some textures moving over your character and enemies. This makes combat very difficult, because you can't see where to move and shoot. Oh and by the way, all of these graphical issues can barely be fixed by compatability modes. The first time I launched the game it looked like I was on acid or something. My experience personally was marred by these technical issues, and while they may not be present on every user's machine, I can't reccommend this game because I didn't get a chance to play it right. I thought it looked neat and I picked it up, but with only a half hour's playtime i didn't get what I wanted out of it.\n\nThis is a problem with some older games on steam, I had no real warning the game would/could essentially be unplayable due to graphical glitches. Gorky 17 probably should be taken off Steam and GoG until someone patches it (if someone cares enough.) It has a decent premise, but it will never be expanded upon unless you like can get past the graphical oddities.","June 21, 2014","false","0.5"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","17","37","0","4"

It's short and doesn't have much depth. I'm not talking about the story, characters and such, I'm talking about the gameplay. However, for me at least, very memorable. This is one of my first games, which I truly enjoy and finish couple of times back then. It's like Japanese turn-based tactical RPG but with Western science-fiction horror flavor. Think of it like FF Tactics Lite version. A very lite, that is.\n\nNothing will blow you away in awe, but it's just simply good, guilty pleasure. Some of the monster/mutant designs were actually great, altho they don't look good by its outdated graphics by now.\n\nAlso there're not much options or even difficulty settings in game. The backgrounds are pre-rendered images, and they're low res. If you don't mind those, this game is great.\n\nI tried to get it installed using the disc but I can't remember why it doesn't work. I was very tempted to buy this game when I saw it on Steam.\n\nDo I recommend it? Not this release.\n\nGraphical glitches and bugs everywhere and the publisher don't even put any effort fixing it or upgrading it for modern systems. Instead they working on Mac release. I know, this is more than a decade old game, and they probably don't keep the source, but still, that doesn't make them have the right to release a broken product.\n\nSure, there're workarounds from the users, and if you don't mind jumping through these hoops, I'd actually recommend it. But that doesn't justify lazy re-releases like this.\n\nPerhaps it'll run better on Wine under Linux or the Mac release, since most older games run better under it. I haven't tried it myself tho.\n\nIt's cheap, so if you're tempted, give it a try. I got this Steam release for free, so.. meh.","November 18, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The story isn’t that bad actually but nothing memorable, its the usual ”scientific research went work and some special forces have been sent to investigate it”.\n\nSome of the advertised features are little strange, like the ”multiple-choice dialog”, there was not a single dialog where you could choose anything, I think there was totally only about 30 lines of dialog in the whole game, so that about the ”enthralling dialog”.\n\nThe skills you can train are mostly useless, I think that only luck and HP were useful enough to put points in.\n\nBut otherwise this is still some decent old school turn-based action game, just don’t except any RPG elements in it. Its moderately challenging, the beginning can be frustratingly hard as you don’t get too many ammo and medpaks, so you always need to think every step thoroughly, every turn counts and you can not make any mistakes.\n\nBe warned, it might not work on newer machines. I got it running on my old laptop (WIN7) but it didn’t even start on my new desktop setup (with Win7 also), always crashed on the start. Even on my laptop it still crashed sometimes in battles, it has really bad bug in the second last fight, where it would crash every time I killed the last monster in the battle, and the only way around it was skipping that battle with cheat-code.\n\n6/10","April 10, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love hard games, as I grew up with that kind of thing. When people say games were traditionally much more difficult 15+ years ago, it's the truth. If you want something to hold your hand, this isn't it. If you want an enjoyable turn-based strategy game with rpg elements, set in a dark atmosphere and filled with grotesque abominations that are equal parts flesh and metal, then this is something you would enjoy.\nIt's a great game, and I recommend it to any fans of the genre.\n\nImportant-ish Note: Out of the video cards that I have (Geforce 760 gtx and Radeon HD4870x2), the Geforce works perfectly, and I actually still have issues with the Radeon (Win7 x64), and actually have to run the game in software mode for it to be playable.","February 25, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","14"

I remember playing the demo AGES ago, but I never found a copy of the game then forgot about it.  The game's ok but has lots of flaws.  some weapons only shoot in straight lines, or straight lines and diagonals.  If you aren't standing in the right spot, you can't shoot things.  There's no cover.  Gear is limited, but mostly I like that about the game.  It makes you stingy with ammo, you melee more often.  Some weapons "recharge" so have unlimited shots but you can only use them every 2 or 3 turns.  Fair trade-off I suppose for unlimited ammo.   If a character dies or leaves the party in a scripted event you can't recover their gear.  It's gone.  I'd understand if they walked away, but even if they die right at your feet the stuff's gone.  it's an okay game for what it is, and for the price.","September 29, 2013","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Paying attention for attacking angles, support items, damages types and constantly keeping an eye on the supplies is important.\n- The story is pretty good too. Don't expect extra sides of originalty, but it does it's work to keep things interesting,\n- Voice-over is okay.\n\nCons\n- Low replayability: in every playthrough is the same, the same battles with the same monsters, everything is in the same place - basically it's a one-stop-gamer for most of the gamers.\n- Voice-over is okay, and talking between the characters lets you to pick up little details about then, but not it just fits in every time. The voice actors fall of the character from time to time. The conversations only occur during the cutscenes and the beginnings of the battles, and sometimes are quite inconsequential (for example in an battle with a lot of enemies, the characters are sarcastical and and ♥♥♥♥♥ure, yet in the next fight with against only two enemy the got paranoid and scared of dying. Not a big problem, but makes the image look worse.\n- Gameplay mechanics are sometimes inconsequental and has bugs (only one damage-over-time effect can be active, the enemy has electricity protection yet can be tranquilitized with a shocker, and theres a game crashing bug in one of the battles, so here's the solution for that: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Gorky_17#Incubus_Boss_Crash)\n- For me it's a bit short. You can play through the whole game with every area explored, every enemies slain, and every item picked up under 15 hours.\n\nOverall, Gorky 17 is a fine survival TBS/point-and-click hybrid game with semi-isometric graphics in a horror-sci/fi setting. It's mixing the genres well. It has it's flaws, yes, but it makes up for it as well.\nAnd also, I warn everyone to use discretion: If the game seems a little bit outdated, old, antiquated... well, it is. This game is originally came out in 1999, as the descprition says, in an age when Pentium III/IV processors, GeForce 256 video cards,  1280x1024 monitor resolution and DVD discs were the BIG things and the WinXP was still in development.\nIn the release year, this game was a fine product őf technology, but sadly stayed under the radar. However, up to this day this game still has a small, but sturdy fanbase, and three or four year ago there was an announcement of a sequel for this game under the name of Gorky 21. (sadly again, not much can be heard about it since then)\nIn my opinion, if this game had the random encounter system at least, and some random-generated terrain between the key locations. it would become a classic cult game. like the original Fallout series. Well, not exactly on the same level, but close enough.\n\nAll in all, I totally recommend this old, yet pretty and shiny pearl of gaming to everyone who won't turn down an old game, looks for a bit different TBS experience and likes if a game challanges them to weight and plan their every action,","August 11, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A serious line can sounds silly and funny.\nAnd one thing, this game is hard. At least for me.\n\nThe gameplay itself is your typical grid based strategy ala X-com or even final fantasy tactics but a bit minimalistic.\nBattles will occur on spesific point in an area. And there is no random battles.\nBattlefields are flat with some obstacles. There are some object that you can interact with.\nEnemies have a lot of variation, each with their own behavioral pattern and strength, you'll need good strategy to effectively eliminate them.\n\nOne thing that marred this game is the way they handle ammo and consumables.\nTHERE IS NO SHOP!!\nThe only way to heal yourself is by using consumables that can only be gained from boxes.\nThe same thing also applied to ammo, weapons and armor.\n\nSo killing everything effectively is very important lest youre running out of stuff and can't move on.\nOverall this game is pretty good. It's challenging and has good horror vibes. It has decent playtime about 10 hours or so and  has solid replayability value.\n\nOld maybe, but definitely worth to be played.","November 4, 2015","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
