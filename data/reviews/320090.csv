"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hukdora/recommended/320090/","hukdora","Hukdora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hukdora/","694 products in account","This comes with a bare recommendation with a caveat. The game is simple. Much of the puzzle gameplay falls down to trial and error while you learn how to create various celestial objects. So if you like simple, relaxing games than you will like this. If you don't like trial and error though, this game will be INCREDIBLY frustrating.\n\nA delightful little puzzle game with visual novel elements. Basically the crux of the game falls down to: you are asked to create specific celestial bodies (stars, nebula, planets etc) in the 'Star Seeing Basin'. The basin contains gases of five elements, and placing various 'seeds' at different locations within the basin affects what celestial object will form. So trial and error. You are given hints as to how specific things will form – which not only includes where a seed is placed in the basin, but its proximity to other placed objects – but essentially it comes down to experimentation. This basin affects the flow of energy within Kyoto. As you form new celestial bodies in the basin through experimentation and thus complete requests, you then travel to each of the five locations in Kyoto within the game which will give a progression of the story. Each location has a character to meet, and basically you affect their lives as you manipulate the basin.\n\nOne of the first things you notice is how animated characters are. Usually even with higher budget VN games it is static images talking to each other. Here there is lip-flapping, clothes and hair moving to wind etc. The drawings can be a little on the crude side occasionally, but it still fits within the distinct artstyle. The music likewise is very good and matches the mood and style of the game very nicely. The localisation is solid and has a flair and finesse to the translation that Carpe Fulgur have become known for. It is something a little different from them and adds nicely to their catalog of interesting titles. Basically this game is something good to chill and relax with.","June 1, 2015","true","4.6"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","37","38","0","0"

Although once you actually start the game, you notice that the characters are actually animated (they actually open their mouths in the Visual Novel-ish portions of the game), and their clothing are a separate layer which animates all the time, which gives the game a nice little aesthetic of its own. The story is okay (so far) and the characters are very likeable.\n\nThe gameplay itself also surprised me: It's very hands-off. It does nudge you into some general concepts at first, and gives you some hints, but most of the gameplay is actually a form of experimentation with the tools you're given. You use a Star-seeing Basin to place star seeds and other "building blocks" into it. The game gradually gives you more and more of these building blocks - various types of basic stars - which you then combine into more complex stars and other celestial bodies via placement, proximity, density, timing, energy (there's five "types" and they govern what types of stars you'll get), etc.\n\nI found the game at its best when I was just trying various combinations to just see what would happen. This can sometimes be frustrating when you're trying to figure out how to make a specific star or a more complex astronomical body and you're not sure anymore what you have and have not attempted, but it's incredibly satisfying when you eventually do figure it out.","June 8, 2015","true","11.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

It seems to be working!\n\nThe gist is basically there's this Star Basin that is able to affect what's going on in various places in Kyoto. By creating stars (however one is supposed to do that) of certain types fulfill the quests you've been given and it progresses the game. Seriously, this isn't a game style I've ever played before.\n\nIt give you the bare minimum tutorial and leaves you to trial and error like a boss. I felt like a real scientist when I was trying to make a nebula. And then I felt like an inept God when I accidentally created a Black Hole. But that's the real fun of this game. You don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ you are doing but you keep doing it anyway and stuff happens and you're like YEAH I DID THAT AND I DON'T KNOW HOW OR IF I'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT AGAIN BUT WHO CARES BECAUSE I'M AWESOME AND DON'T NEED ANY RULES!!!!\n\nI love this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/recommended/320090/","silentcaay","SilentCaay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/","247 products in account","This is a rather quirky puzzle game. I can recommend it but I will also warn you it requires some patience. The puzzles come in the form of trying to make certain types of stars and constellations. Making stars can take time, practice and experimentation, though. You sometimes have to wait for various stars to evolve to the right level and if it didn't work out the way you hoped then you may have to start over. The game also doesn't hold your hand. You're expected to just jump right in with a "try various things and see what happens" approach. It is sort of time sink-y in that regard. If you get stuck, however, there's a helpful "SOS" button right in the game that links to a partial walkthrough just in case. If you're looking for a more laid-back kind of game, you should be able to get into it.\n\nThe story is delivered in VN-style cutscenes and you learn of various NPCs' problems that you try to alleviate with the help of the Star-Seeing Basin - a kind of sea monkey tank for pseudo stars. You'll place various types of seeds in the basin, grow some stars, combine some elemental alignments and, voilà!, problems solved. If you're still not sure, there is a demo available. Check it out!\n\nFinal Edit: Don't take my playtime to be an indicator of the length of the game. Due to the large amount of downtime while growing stars, I often played this while doing other things so the playtime is inflated from idling. Having completed the game, I would still recommend it to any puzzle game fan. It's rather unique and the story, while not terribly fantastic, still does a decent job of driving the game and giving you goals.","June 10, 2015","true","29.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/McWhiteGK/recommended/320090/","McWhiteGK","McWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/McWhiteGK/","363 products in account","This Starry Midnight We Make is a charming indie game with experimentation at its heart. I do not think this is a puzzlegame and I think that's a good thing.\nAfter having completed this game 100% I can recommend this game to everyone who is a perfectionist, likes astronomy or is just generally packed with curiousity.\n\nGameplay:\nI was intrigued by how well this game handles exploration and experimantations and I rarely found myself frustrated as the game always ever so slightly nudges you in the right direction. If you really read the descriptions and the dialogue you will get through 90% of this game without having too much trouble.\n\nWhich leads me to the last 10%.\nThe game puts a timer on each type of star you can plant and thats fine as long as you can switch between multiple different "building sites" where you try to figure out how stars evolve, however, It gets tedious as soon as you are set to get this one star that completes a sequence and you need like 20 or 50 of these beginner-stars which only regenerate at a snail like rate.\nMy tipp: If you 100% this game you should watch some youtube videos on the side or a movie or something.\n\nGraphics:\nThis Game has surpsingly good character models which can do a variety of animated expressions which I would love to see more in games that feature this visual novel like style. There is a downside to this though, or should I say a bummer: You don't really see the character expression when you have to read the text... So this would have worked much better in a fully voiced game, but then again, this was done by only a handful of people.\n\nStory:\nBasically you have 5 storylines: 4 people living in the town the game takes place in and your own.\nThere is nothing much to say otherwise. There is not nearly enough dialogue or time you spend with each character to get you deeply invested, but each character is unique in his own way and well written (props to carpefulgur).\nThe twists and overarching story are interesting enough so the story ends up being a definite plus for the game.\n\nI also like how they use the story to drive the progression of the game, give you hints for certain type of stars and give you an overall sense of purpose. As a result this game does not suffer from "Ludonarrative dissonance" which I am always a fan of.","September 9, 2015","true","15.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

(Don't be misled by the number of 'visual novel' screenshots, that portion of the game is just a fairly slight framing device...)\n\nThis game is for people who like to poke an opaque puzzle until they're able to make sense of how it works. It will take a lot of experimentation and patience, but it's pretty satisfying when it works. (Some of the recipes were just too unguessable for me to figure out, so I wound up looking up some of the answers, but even for those ones I still had fun experimenting.)\n\nIt has almost a 'clicker'-like level of compulsiveness when you're setting up experiments--ingredients take time to mix (though usually only a few seconds) so you can start setting up a second trial while the first one matures, and so on...\n\nAbsolutely worth playing if you like experimenting and can enjoy a little frustration.","January 2","true","15.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You play as a young girl who gets lost during a festival and winds up in a strange shrine where she meets an odd man and gets sucked into an even odder journey involving a mysterious basin imbued with celestial magic and the destinies of many people around Kyoto.\n\nThe art in the game is pretty nice. It's got a unique visual style that is reminiscent of something like Gankutsuou: Count of Monte Cristo where articles of clothing somehow have moving patterns in them, and all characters are actually animated and move, which I found pretty neat.\n\nGameplay wise, you have various seed stars you place in the basin which is divided up into five colors corresponding to Onmyou magic, Red, Black, Yellow, Blue and White. You basically have to create certain stars and constellations that have power to help whatever issue a character is having. There's a lot of experimentation and patience involved in trying to find the right combination and oftentimes you can get lost trying to figure out how something works. I eventually had to use a guide for the just one constellation I was having trouble with in the main story, but I for the most part managed to get a majority of the story related goals by just experimenting on combinations of seed stars and seeing what happens. I suppose this might get frustrating for people who don't like trial and error gameplay, but I didn't mind it that much. That said there's a therapeutic aspect to it as well. You can just place stars in and watch them grow without having to do much. You can leave it running and they'll evolve on their own. It feels rather relaxing, and there is also an option to make the growth of the objects in the celestial basin faster if you don't wanna wait as well.\n\nMusic wise the game is great. I wouldn't say there's any track that particularly stands out, but the music is definitely fitting and sounds really nice. Has a sense of mystery and wonder that lines up with the game.\n\nThere's more to do after finishing up the main story, and according to the steam achievements you can apparently create a God... How many games let do that? That makes this a winner for me. This game has also gotten me interested in the rest of the works of CAVYHOUSE, one of which just got released on steam: My Organic Garden\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/363980/\n\nWhich if it's anything like this game, should also be a real treat. I would totally recommend this game to anyone looking for a rather atypical but fascinating visual novel experience.","August 25, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/totallytoltage/recommended/320090/","totallytoltage","Toltage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/totallytoltage/","259 products in account","This game is actually an interesting find. To shortly describe the gameplay, if you've ever played the "Alchemy" type of games where you mix multiple elements together to make more elements, This Starry Midnight We Make is almost like that. However in this game there are added restraints and rules that make it a bit more complex, those being that you can only make certain types of stars in their designated sections of the Basin, and stars need time and gases to further evolve, among other contraints. And the combinations of star types are nowhere near as obvious initially as a lot of elements in Alchemy (fortunately the game has a link to a game FAQ if you get stumped on anything progress-blocking).\n\nAdditionally another aspect that furthers it from those types of games is the fact that you attain quests from characters you meet in the story scenes of the game, which is notably the other half of TSMWM. So rather than constantly throwing particles of stardust at each other over and over without concrete goal, you'll have milestones for all four side characters (for most of the game anyway). Also worth noting that the story scenes aren't too bad for a small title like this one. Art and music are fairly decent, and the writing has some charm to it. I wouldn't say the story is groundbreaking by any means, but it serves its purpose well enough.\n\nIf you've got a few bucks to throw around and want something more relaxed, definitely worth a few hours of playtime.","January 10","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
