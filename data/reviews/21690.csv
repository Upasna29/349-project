I really enjoy the atmosphere and the involvement and tools available for co-operative play.\n\nHowever, if you're playing this game with the mentality of it being a sequal to some of the original Resident Evils, you're going to be disappointed. You will get the most enjoyment out of the game if you go in with the mindset that it will be a cinematic action game.\n\n\nEdit: Since this is actually getting attention or something, I'm going to emphasize: If you've played any classic Resident Evil games (1, 2, 3), from Resident Evil 4 and onward they are *not the same kind of game*.\nWhile Resident Evil 4 could possibly get a bit of a pass on still being a horror game, this is NOT a horror game. It's an action game. Go into it expecting a co-op-heavy action game, and only then will the game become very enjoyable.","September 12, 2014","true","652.2"," 94 of 108 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","94","108","8","5"

This is one of my favourite games of all time.  But this port is disgusting.  The list of intended features pales in comparison to the console versions, because they think they can get away with it.  The DLC comes out 6 years after the game, at a horriffic price, and I buy the game at that time, expecting to repeat my console experience with my girlfriend.  Turns out, not only have they done that, they've removed local co-op entirely.  They've even gone to extra length to prevent modders from adding it.\n\nEven more disgusting is that was a top priority.  Hundreds of people in Capcom's own crash/bug thread on Steam alone, can't even start this bloody thing.  Other people get to certain chapters and can't finish.  Versus is an advertised feature that just doesn't work.  We have region lock and crashes and immense lag.  We are waiting months for a patch and from what I hear none's coming.  What does this say to us?  It says consumers take up the role of playtesting, and if it's worth Capcom's while they'll fix our problems.  What problems have they fixed?  Quite a few, but before any patch of any kind, when converting from GFWL to Steam, the split-screen code modders had used, was totally purged, meaning forcing people to buy extra copies was more important than each customer's gameplay experience.  And of course, as I've said, they've not approached fixing every problem.\n\nGuess what I've done.  Borrowed my friend's PS3 and that copy of the game to play it with my girlfriend.  Because we're not building a bloody gaming PC just for one game.  Let alone one that we may not even be capable of finishing because its publisher have abandoned it.\n\nNow may I say it?\n\nF V C K\nY O U\nC A P C O M .","July 4, 2015","false","1.3"," 237 of 316 people (75%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","75","237","316","28","0"

Over 1,000 hours on the 360 version, and somewhere close to that between Steam, GFWL, and retail PC disc versions of this game, I'm still enjoying every minute this game is running on any system.\n\nBut the important thing to add here is that finally, after about 5 years, the long-awaited Gold Edition content has made its way to PC (and GFWL has been replaced with Steamworks integration). Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape, Mercenaries Reunion, Versus, and most importantly, Warrior Chris / Heavy Metal Chris, all in 60fps here on the PC version.\n\nA giant majority of my total hours spent in this game have been in the extra game mode, Mercenaries and Mercenaries Reunion; this is a unique time attack mode where you aim to kill a set number of enemies, breaking time bonuses and getting melee kills for additional time as you progress to complete the stage. With 18 characters / costumes across both Mercenaries and Mercenaries Reunion, as well as three variations of each of the 8 stages (Merc, Reunion, and No Mercy), there is plenty of content to keep you playing and having a good time, single player. But throw that all in with the option to play Duo for these modes (as well as the game's feature co-op campaign), and you've added hundreds of hours of additional gameplay with a co-op partner.\n\nLost in Nightmares, one of the Gold Edition campaigns which takes place in the flashback sequence where Chris loses his partner Jill Valentine, is one of the many highlights of the game. Like a love letter to their fans, Lost in Nightmares includes a handful of throwbacks and references to old-school Resident Evil flare (cranks, traps, a piano, and an easter egg featuring classic fixed-camera angles for the beginning segment of the campaign, to name a few). It makes me hopeful for the future of the Resident Evil franchise, and it's the most enjoyable add-on content I've ever played.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about this game, and endless good things to say. Since its release in 2009, I've been in love with Resident Evil 5, and I don't think the love for this game will ever die.","March 26, 2015","true","185.3"," 59 of 76 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","59","76","2","5"

The environment are African but somewhat worse because there are zombies there. Resident Evil 5 is not as scary as it should but fun nevertheles.\n\nResident Evil 5 gameplay aren't that exciting for PC but if you played the franchise before, Resident Evil 5 is quite great. One of the downside is the inventory system, it's very limited and makes you have to attend to it everytime. The AI are not bad but not good either. The AI partner can be told to be in assault stance or cover stance. Assault stance makes the AI partner use the best weapons in his/her inventory and explore around on their own, they even open up some barrels and take the items inside them which is quite helpful when you're lazy to do that, but the AI also somewhat stupid when it comes to healing. They tend to waste herbs and medkits on you even when you didn't really need it. Like all Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 5 sometimes require you to keep your hands on the keyboard in some event, like get ready to press the "F" key to shoot zombies that is going to kill your partner.\n\nResident Evil 5 graphics are good, sometimes a bit cartoonish because sometimes I see a black lines on the edges of the characters, but it's good.

Considering that the RE1 remaster still hasn't seen a patch for its framerate issues in the 2.5 months it's been out, you should be very wary of this.\nI can't stress this enough- don't give up your hard-earned cash until the game is in a release-worthy state.\n\nEDIT: As of April 10th, Capcom has responded to the community's call for local co-op and 3D support by making the original GFWL version available through Steam's branch system.\n\nNot only is this an incredibly lazy solution, it also doesn't work for any of the Steamworks-only Gold Edition content. It would be a nice hold-over if the development team were working on official implementations of the missing features, but the official steam community forum thread makes no mention of such things.\n\nTo me, this indicates that the 'Fix Co-Op' and 'Fix 3D' boxes on Capcom's to-do list have been checked, and that they are moving on.

I heard, of course, about the franchise but that is mainly attributed to the films with the Ukrainian model Milla Jovovich. I bought this one on Steam sale many years ago but only recently have I been able to find someone to complete the game with.\n\nAnd this is an important part to mention: the game is playable with somebody else as there are two protagonists. In case you do not find any one the A.I. can take control of the 2nd player but does a horrible job. So, grab a friend and make sure you also have a Live account as this is the 2nd annoying thing in this game - it still uses an already obsolete service. Once you start a game only via Live can you send the invite and of course the achievements are logged there.\n\nNow that we have settled these two things we can move on to the actual game itself. The story and the cutscenes are VERY cheesy, however, the cutscenes pack a punch! There are more than 50 videos that are all replayable from the main menu. They are awesome! Cheesy but very-well made! There are 6 chapters divided up further into a couple of stages; you easily spend roughly 15 hours with the first playthrough.\n\nThe game itself is difficult at times: the gameplay itself is a bit "redundant" as no dodging is possible and when aiming your character cannot move, at all. You rely on each other and there are certain stages where you have to cooperate closely - only one of you can move while the other must provide protection. Also, bullets are limited so you have to carefully make every shot as each bullet counts.\n\nAre you annoyed by quick time events? Well, RE 5 has many of those. During the cutscenes and also during boss battles. Some combinations popping up require some getting used to and these should be hit hardly very quickly.\n\nOnce you have familiarised yourself with the RE characteristics the game can be enjoyed, quite much. In fact, there are many collectibles and as weapons upgrades can be purchased with the collected treasure all upgraded weapons can be transferred to a 2nd gameplay. Just make sure you pick the New Game + option from the main menu. New difficulty is also unlocked if you want more challenge.\n\nI liked this game.

Everything plays well and I havent recognized any problems yet.\n\nThis game I recommend you getting asap, since its really good. And yes its worth the fulll price.\n\nQuestions:\n\nWill it run on a older PC? Yes it will, its not demanding and its pretty ok optimized\n\nIs it a long game? The story is pretty long yeah, but there is also a awesome co-op mode, and other missions to enjoy.\n\nDoes it feel like a real resident evil game?

It's also on the same way length as the original retail GFWL version because none of the old glitches were fixed.\n\nThere were obviously many things they could've tried working on, the lag glitches in co-op (shooting an enemy takes no effect for a good three seconds, in mercs that can be a massive problem), the fact versus has many crash problems, likewise with merceneries (and reunion), the save file tool not being avalible is also a really bad thing to do if you're releasing a game that has been around for this long. I've dedicated hours to replaying chapters and trying to work through stuff I've had done for years. It's annoying.\n\nWe've waited so long for this DLC, but I could've waited a bit longer for a game that worked and wasn't repackaged cola.\n\nIf you ever played the original retail GFWL Mercs, you probably know what I'm talking about; the amount of people running around with trainers, cheats and the amazing fact you can glitch having more than two people in a session. However I'd rather be in a game with four Midnight Weskers trying to figure out who I was meant to be teamed up with than this. We were all the same Wesker, someone died during the game and of course it was a terrible session, but it was playable. So far I've spent close to an hour trying to sort out a Versus game that never ended up happening and Mercs games that drop for no reason.\n\nBy all means, it's great finally having the full DLC, I've been a longtime fan of Resident Evil despite the usual bad treatment you get as a PC gamer. It's nice finally getting to go through the full stories, but that doesn't exclude the negative, gaping problems they just overlooked with this release.","April 7, 2015","false","99.4"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","27","38","3","0"

I belong to the "I think RE5 is simply a great game" camp. It's entertaining, has a lot of good ideas, and how can anyone not love Mercenaries? With the recent transition to Steam I had to give the game another (3-4) playthroughs and tell you all about it.\n\n"Uroborus will be released into the atmosphere ensuring complete global saturation."\nThis memetic line -- spoken by a man with evil eyes -- from one of the few unskippable scenes in the entirety of RE5 explains the plot. I can't recall any of the rest. Capcom used to develop arcade games, so every now and then these storylines seep into their console titles. While it's easy to write this game off as dumb action movie shlock, I think we have to look deeper. After all, dumb action movies are released every day, yet hardly any of them are on the level of Die Hard.\n\nLet's start with the most important aspect: the mechanics. Yep, it's that word again. Everytime I review a crappy beatemup on Steam I have to mention the mechanics. Capcom has made some of the best beatemups ever: Aliens Vs Predator, Cadillacs & Dinosaurs, Final Fight, Dungeons & Dragons, and so on. They've attained mastery of mechanics as far as I'm concerned. With this knowledge, they can do everything from fighting games to third-person shooters. When somebody puts out a crappy beatemup, I know that they have no business making a game in any other genre (except for maybe a turn-based RPG).\n\nBut what is mechanics? Everyone has their own definition, but I look at it as the player's relationship with the world. This covers every action, no matter how subtle. This can be everything from the height and arc of Mario's jump, to what happens when a flying axe is shot, or how much space is necessary for a mayor to dodge a punch. Great mechanics work when you never notice them. It's supposed to be seamless, so when you dodge a thousand bullets in a 2D shooter, you feel like you've been doing it since birth.\n\nThe most prominent aspect of these great mechanics is in how the weapons feel. Each gun has its own characteristics, and using them properly is exciting and rewarding. Majini also respond appropriately depending on where you shoot them and what they're doing. This goes beyond shooting them in the head or in the knees to setup a melee attack. There's other tricks like clipping a shoulder, which causes their arm to fly back. This can be useful if an enemy is carrying dynamite, and it's just out of the player's sights.\n\nIt also can't be stressed enough how effective unrealistic or overly "gamey" mechanics can be. When you're surrounded by monsters in any other game, your first instinct isn't to punch the one that's staggering. In RE5 however, that maneuver can buy you precious invulnerability. All too often, videogames give you these cool techniques you can perform, but they leave you open to attack, so they're never used. Providing an incentive is key, it empowers the player, makes them more willing to take risks, and thus have more fun. In the interest of balance, not every game should function in this manner, but it suits the later RE games extremely well.\n\nIn keeping with the arcade game theme, RE5 is best-described as a compatibility shooter. Cooperative? That's the term I'd use to describe Borderlands or something. Sometime in the late 90s/ early 00s, Arcade light-gun developers like Sega & Namco started pushing the compatibility aspect. When you played a light-gun shooter like Let's Go! Jungle or Deadstorm Pirates, end-of-level ratings weren't given just to you. When you played with a friend, a loved-one, or even a complete stranger, it was the relationship that was rated. This meant that if you were doing stuff like hogging all of the enemies or allowing your partner to take damage, you and your partner would get punished with a lower rating. In a way, two people that performed admirably in a light-gun game could be considered lifetime best-friends, lovers, etc.\n\nRE5 is designed along those same lines, that's what makes it a compatibility shooter. The next time you play RE5, keep an eye on your partner. Sure there are plenty of moments that force the co-op angle, like the shared QTEs, or those times where you have to cover your partner while they do something, but I'm talking about all of the subtle aspects. For example, note the laser-sights. This isn't just a holdover from RE4. You can see where your partner is aiming, so you know when to cover their back. Enemies tend to come from multiple directions, so situations where you do the lion's share of the work are few and far between. Over time you develop a sense of what your partner is thinking. You know when they have a situation handled, or when they need to be bailed out.\n\nThere's also the context-sensitive B button. When you give someone a herb, pressing the B button will say "Thank you", and you'll hear some variant of "Nice!" when your partner nails a sweet headshot. Typically, when you perform some action in spectacular fashion, you'll see "Great!" pop up on-screen or hear it spoken (My personal favorite is "Nice Driving" in Daytona USA. This is a holdover from the arcade days. Arcade games are short, and your actions have immediate consequences. When you do something right, the game pats you on the head. RE5 is designed so that you and your partner are expected to pat each other on the head, thus we have the B button.\n\nRE5's campaign is altogether solid, but it has some definite mis-steps. Boss-fights in RE games tend to be generally hit or miss. More often than not they're about taking advantage of clumsy AI path-finding or shooting large glowing targets with the magnum. RE5 has all this, and a bullet-sponge turret boss to boot. There's also the 5-2 boss, which screams "Use a rocket launcher on me". Also, while not-zombies with guns aren't a huge deal to me, they're a massive pain in Professional mode. This, combined with the ridiculous short revival time (you have to be right on top of your partner to save them), is just annoying. For the most part though I think RE5 is solidly put-together. It pushes the compatibility elements quite well.\n\nMercenaries is absolutely perfect. There's no need for a wall of text to explain why.\n\nAltogether, RE5 is a very satisfying game. Give it another go if you haven't already.","April 2, 2015","true","60.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","1"

The games aren't scary, but they are enjoyable. RE4 was, perhaps, the high mark of Capcom's decision to go in an action-oriented direction. The gameplay was fresh, the story was enjoyable, and the setting they chose was remarkably well done. I'll go so far as to say that they hit the 'rural horror where something is terribly wrong with the locals' vibe better than most proper horror titles do.\n\nRE5 came fast on the heels of 4, and basically has the same kind of gameplay with a reduced emphasis on exploring the environment and a focus on violence. The choice to move to Africa for the setting wasn't a bad one - colonial issues aside, there's plenty of things to be scared of out there. It provides a great excuse to combine dilapidated equipment and urban environments with a vast selection of rural locales. Nothing wrong with that at all.\n\nThe Good:\nChris and Sheva are both fairly fun to play, with a handful of distinct weapons to each one. They also have distinct combat styles, with Chris being a 'roid-pumped bruiser and Sheva being more of a finesse fighter. The enemies are more dangerous than RE4 - the humanoid enemies are better armed, and the non-human ones are tougher than their counterparts in RE4. There are new ones running around which are almost too tough (those damned mantis-ants, for instance), but you'll find a decent challenge throughout.\nThere's a large supply of weapon and costume unlocks as well. The costumes are a bit of a wash (the club gear ones are especially terrible), but the weapons are solid. The minigun in particular is great to play with - it chews enemies to pieces, but you'll need time to let it rev up.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe inventory system is crap. There's no other way to describe it. The elegant attache case from RE4 was far better, but they swapped it out for a more traditional limited slot system. You'll find yourself swapping ammo and the like with your partner more often then you should need to.\nThe partner AI is...okay, for the most part. Okay, but not great. They'll still waste healing items on you when you don't need them, and they do tend to get mauled if you leave them off by themselves.\nWesker, your main opponent, has crossed over into Mary Sue territory by this point. He's your typical modern body horror anime villain cranked up to 11, bouncing RPGs and heavy caliber weapons like he was half Kryptonian. It's only his over-the-top voice acting and performance that saves him as a villain.\nAnd, of course...the race issues. Really, this isn't too bad for the first and later acts of the game. Most of your enemies are a variety of ethnic types, not out of line for the right parts of Africa. In the late stages, the Manjini you're facing are in advanced stages of infection, so most of those are a necrotic blue with obvious decay creeping in around the edges. Again, not a problem.\nThe middle acts of the game, which take place in a tribal reserve and underground city...there's the problem locale. You're up against tribesmen who wouldn't be out of place in a mid-quality pulp novel, attacking you with spears. The game tries to hand wave this by stating the locals went crazy, and reverted to the 'old ways', but it's a bit crass and kind of silly at best. I don't think there was an intentional bid to be offensive, this is pulp story/action-adventure cliche territory, but it's definitely not a comfortable thing and I don't fault people who find it offensive.\n\nWould I recommend?\nAbsolutely. This is a fun game, and issues aside you'll have a good time shooting monsters and running for your life when you're not shooting monsters. The voice acting is cheesy, the story is pulp silliness, the setting is great, and the action delivers more often than it stumbles. If the second act of the game doesn't put you off, you'll have a blast.","October 30, 2015","true","36.6"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","0"

Resident Evil 5 people who love survival horror love 1-3 thanks the cameras it was always unique what comes behind the next corner, have i enough ammo, do i use the right weapon? 4 has mor enemies, the enemies was great, could hold with ceberus, hunters and reapers and the bosses could hold up with the yawn and Co. The story was good, take care of Ashely nervs many and many want the first developed Resident Evil HQ over Paris, but what makes Resident Evil was always Chris, Jill, Rebecca, Barry, Leon, Claire, Ada, Sherry and Co.. The Characters and the Story, if you want survival do Re4 on highest difficulty only with knife and gun without upgrades and get the survival back. Resident Evil 5 has a nice story. You come with Jill is dead, Wesker kills Spencer, Chris get to africa and get a new partner. Sheiva very long i dont like her, but now where i restart playing this game after 2-3 years i get to love her lovely kind character. Sure vs Jill she has no good cards but its fine. The game has really great locations and the best is where we find the source of the Prognito and T-Virus. What a place. The bosses are tough even on low difficulty they can eat much ammo if you dont have a rocketluncher or magnum on veteran and profi you can forget every pistol, you can only play damage weapons and hope to have enough ammo and not get hit because 1-2 hits its over. This game had so many qualities and extras, you can find so many weapons, so many items/ treatures, hidden objects and can fail at the level end. Sure some level you can finish quick and the price of the DLC after years was a bad joke, but the spencer mansion has some quality of older games and i had many funny times.\n\nI thanks Capcom for this game. Watch trailer, if you want a good game, buy it if you want Resident Evil 1 with the camera system and only new locations and puzzles, buy 0-3 and maybe Code Veronica and play every part 100 times. For me this game gets 90 %.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/21690/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I spent countless hours on RE5 on xbox 360. The PC version has great graphics and still delivers dynamic game play, however it does lack local co-op :(. All in all, definitely worth a purchase on sale.\n\nRE5 takes place in Africa with Chris and Sheva, agents of the BSAA group which contains bio-virus weapons. You are basically fighting zombies with some cognition about what's going on, they aren't blindly stupid walking around like most zombie games. Rather, these "infected" come at you from all sorts of angles and drop down from all sorts of heights to greet you with a chainsaw, machete, crossbow or just a good old fashioned hammer. Characters vary from simple opponents which can be taken down with a few shots, to heavier opponents that may charge or swing obscenely heavy weapons at you.\n\nWhat makes this game so good though? At first, I hated the game layout as it was tough to access my equipment menu or to pull out my gun. I should say that you CANNOT fire from the hip. You have to aim down your sights first in order to get a shot off. These two reasons sort of put me off but as I got deeper into the story, I got pulled in and liked how they intermingled melee with the ability to shoot opponents. You CANNOT simply press a button and start hitting someone. Just like pressing two buttons to get a shot off, you need to hold LB (to pull your machete out) then hit RT to get a hit off. This is one melee mode, the other involves "stunning" the opponents (boss's and regular opponents are susceptible to this) and then running up to them and pressing X which usually knocks them on their bum. Additionally, when the opponents are on the ground the player has a moment to curb stomp them (as seen in Gears of War). This melee mode is very particular, just as the entire game is made this way. You do not feel in complete control of the game until you've familiarized yourself with the game mechanics. Either you'll hate what Capcom did or you'll like it, simple as that. When you recognize when an opponent is stunned it makes a world of difference. I should also add when your partner is being held down by a zombie, the other partner can run up and press B to free the partner. I'm going to say it again even though I already said it, you'll either get along with this sort of game mechanic or you'll find it annoying you can't simply fire from the hip or melee at will. The movement controls over all feel smooth while the camera cannot be moved from an over the shoulder position. I have to give them credit for trying to include a wide variety of weapons from rifles, shotguns, automatics and pistols. On top of that, incendiary grenades, regular grenades are also included with a compliment of herbs that you can mix to heal yourself (or your partner on the fly). There is a slight RPG element to the game where you can upgrade weapons for better impact and a quicker reloading scheme. I would highly suggest spending your money wisely and choosing a weapon you know you'll be using a lot.\n\nThe graphics as I've mentioned are a lot better than xbox 360's version, everything feels smooth and the cinematics are pretty tight. The sounds are decent and do not really sound different from shot to shot, or when you break a barrel. The opponents also sound generically the same (unless you're facing a unique boss).\n\nOverall, if this version had local co-op it would get a higher rating. Since it's a PC version and apparently we don't play local, it's going to hurt it's score a bit. None the less, a great game and would highly recommend it on sale.\n\nRATING : 7.8/10","November 6, 2015","true","2.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Even when I tried to play it with an Xbox controller. This was one of two reasons, why I gave up on this game like three times before I finished it completely. Most of the things were very different to other shooting games like being not able to move while shooting or reloading. Also accessing the inventory, because I am not able to memorize what gun i set up for positions above 4..\n\nBut as I remember all the RE PSX games I've used to play - the story is touching your heart. You wanna be the hero and having sexy Sheva as your partner is flooding your veins with an adrenaline. The surrounding graphics are not perfect, but thanks to that, the whole game runs smoothly as butter.\n\nPros:\nGood storyline\nSexy Sheva\nBonuses (Cut scenes, costumes, figurines, unlocking game modes)\nSmooth runs\nI found just 2 small bugs by myself (and those were no big deals) - BRAVO!\nEasy ways to find ammo\nGood map navigation\n\nCons:\nThe way of controlling the characters\nSome bosses were really tough and you have to repeat the fight one hundred million times..\nYou're not able to chat with your online partner and the commands are very limited\nProblems with Windows Live Account at the beginning of game\nIf someone wants to join you, it's not possible immediately. You have to restart the game from a checkpoint..\n\nThe cons are really not so terrible I couldn't recommend the game.

We started playing the game around the afternoon and finished it at around 5AM, looking at the sun rise as we light our cigarrettes.\n\nHonestly speaking though, I thought this game was utter sh!t at the time. I was a huge fan of RE4, but this one just felt like an uninspired sequel to that with a crappy coop mechanics. I mean, this is a survival horror. I thought the concept of "being alone" is one of the vital elements for that genre, no? The game was painfully linear with stage based progression with no back tracking. All you do is just pewpew some enemies and then move on the next area to shoot more of those locals. Just like every other games out there.\n\n7yrs later, I bought this game when it went on sale and I'm somehow having a blast. I can even tolerate the terrible Sheva AI. I have no idea why I enjoy it now when I didn't before. Did I get old? Maybe it's the nostalgia. Maybe I just miss those care free days of being able to play videogames allnight with my best friend.....\n\n\nor maybe It's because this game is at least 10 times better than RE6.

The story is also quite deep, interesting and tied to previous entries of the series: the fact most of the cheesy lines are gone is also something I truly appreciate. You'll meet both new and returning enemy types while exploring varied levels such as shanty towns, marshes, caves etc... this not only keeps things fresh but also requires you to change your tactics whenever a new foe comes up.\n\nThe co-op oriented game design is a mixed bag, while heaps of fun if played with someone the single player suffers from it at times. Sheva's AI is a very good shot but her reactions aren't always sensible and she'll sometimes waste ammo, not follow you fast enough or generally make a nuisance of herself: this isn't too bad overall but I can only imagine how terrible it'd get on the higher difficulty levels. Bosses can also become harder than they'd be if you're playing with an AI companion as they might find it hard to maneuver accordingly or use their weapons at their best.\n\nDespite a few gripes with the AI and the co-op design Resident Evil 5 is an absolutely fun and rewarding game even if played alone: I'd say it's a recommended purchase for fans of the series/ genre as long as you're not put off by the change in pace and the lack of survival horror elements.\n","April 6","true","15.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Not least of all because of its sheer boldness:  It's a horror game largely set not only in daylight, but blazingly BROAD daylight, and its sense of "political correctness" is distinctly lacking to say the least.\n\nIt helps nothing, in any case, that it starts with one of the most spectacularly unfair and clumsy "action" set-pieces you're ever liable to experience in a video game, but even once you get used to the discrepancy between the game's Michael Bay-esque ambitions and its almost wholesale borrowing of the somewhat "clunky" controls from Resident Evil 4 - such controls simply aren't suited to ridiculous onslaughts of enemies - the game still never feels entirely "fair", what with the copious quantities of quick-time events, some rather challenging "shoot some stuff with a big gun turret" bits which bear little resemblance to the rest of the gameplay, and an AI "partner" who wastes copious amounts of ammo shooting a single enemy who you're quite capably in the process of taking down with your knife.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a bloody good game, and still stacks up very well in the current action-horror marketplace.  But it never quite manages to get the balance between the action and the horror quite right - preposterous bit at the end where your character PUNCHES A BOULDER REPEATEDLY, anyone? - despite the fact that Resident Evil 4 did a fabulous job of showing precisely how such a feat could be achieved.  At least it's a darn sight better than Resident Evil 6, given the couple of hours I've been able to tolerate of THAT one thus far.\n\nThis could'a been a contender for one of the all-time greats, but alas, it's merely a really, really darn good game which has sufficient charm and balls for you to forgive its innumerable faults.  Still flawed, still fascinating, and still a bit of a missed opportunity, methinks.  And no matter which way you look at it, a darn sight better than those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing movies bearing the "Resident Evil" name.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS Seriously...that boulder bit...WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ WERE THEY THINKING?!?)\n\n(PPS How many different ways can YOU say Sheva?

The game is nice if you like action games. Old RE fans will be disappointed though. There is no safe room in this game nor typewriter but a lot of useless minigames and features like unlimited ammo...\n\nThis game is focused on co-op mode. You can play alone with a dumb bot and get frustrated or play together with a friend :) There aren't any classic zombies in this game, only infected people who are armed to the teeth :P The story is kinda boring and bland. You might have already figure out the whole plot once you see all the important characters.\n\nThis game has a lot of issues at the beginning and there are still some bugs left which Capcom may never will fix. Luckily we have a great community here which created some patches and fixes for those issues. (no more region lock for example)\n\nMercenaries/ReunionMercenaries is a gamemode that unlocks when you finished the game. You can choose a character and play on different recycled maps. (except the last) The goal is to make a lot of combos while killing the infected to get a good score until the timer expires. Having a good rank will unlock new characters.\n\nReunion is the same gamemode as Mercenaries but with some new DLC characters which is not included in the full version.\n\nUntold Story DLCIf you want all the achievements you have to buy this DLC (yet another bait to milk of your money) There are some bonus features & campaigns which are included in the untold story DLC. One of the campaign called "Lost in Nightmare" is pretty good imo. It is focused more on the horror aspect and manage to entertain me through the end. The only downside is the short playtime :(\n\nVersus mode is one of the main feature in this DLC but sadly it is dead since no one play this mode anymore. (Also good luck at finding people to complete those achievements... I don't care anymore :P) The DLC is almost worthless without the "Lost in Nightmare" campaign. Buy it at your own risk!\n\nConclusionIf you like action and smart zombies then this is the game for you!\nAll the other ones should buy it only on sales.","December 21, 2015","true","78.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CounterLife/recommended/21690/","CounterLife","« Counter-Life™ »","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CounterLife/","98 products in account","Resident Evil 5 is a fun co-op horror shooter. Unlike the classic Resident Evil games, this game is more focused on action and cooperation with either the AI partner or another player. Personally, I think that the modern RE games don't quite hold up to the classic ones, but that dosen't mean that this is a bad game. No, Resident Evil 5 is a great game. The gameplay is solid: It's a fairly slow paced shooter, with the from RE4 (or more like RE: Dead Aim) typical run, stand and shoot mechanic. There are tons of licensed guns in the game (I'm looking at you RE4 and 6) and they have great detail for a third person shooter. From a graphical standpoint, this game is still a sight for sore eyes. It got better graphics than RE6, which suffers from several low-res textures and low-poly mesh at many points. Movement is pretty basic in RE5, you can walk slowly, run and use a quick turn key. There's no jumping around, rolling or sprinting in this game, and in my opinion, that's a good thing. In RE6 these features seemed partially unnecessary and felt like they came straight out of a some Asian Kung Fu movie.\nThe melee system has been slightly expanded compared to it's predecessor, you can now execute different melee moves depending on the enemy's body part you hit and the resulting stun animation. Every character has his own unique melee moves. You can also chain combos with your partner, the last melee attack of the combo will result in a very powerful attack like Chris' Haymaker or Wesker's Ghost Butterfly. The co-op mechanics are decent, although I feel like the game would have benefited from being a single player experience like RE4. It just makes it much easier for the player to dive into the game's world if you are alone, without a partner spamming "Hurry!", "C'mon!", "Hurry!".  Nether the less, co-op is fun with another player, and I advice you to stay away from the AI partner, because it's HORRIBLE. The inventory system is now in realtime (again, you can blame co-op for that) and is much better than in RE6. RE6 took a huge step backwards and gave the player a somewhat confusing row-based inventory which dosen't show all items at the same time. Weapons don't need any inventory slots either in RE6, so you will run around with about 6 different guns, lowering the inventory management the series is known for even more. The cutscenes are probably the most action filled part of the game, while they are greatly executed, some just feel a bit over the top. It dosen't ruin the game or anything though. The story has it's weakpoints (Jill being mindcontrolled, Wesker's weakness being the serum, the final boss fight), and makes me wonder why they haven't sticked to some of the earlier designs ( Like Wesker having one of his eyes stabbed out by Jill, and later the other eye shot out by Sheva. It makes much more sense than some serum that was never mentioned before.). It still is enough to keep you going, even though the plot twist in this game is a bit obvious and easy to figure out. Once you played through the main game, you'll unlock The Mercenaries mode, which is very similar to the one from RE4. Trying to get better scores can be addicting.\n\nOverall this is a very good game, but it dosen't quite hold up to the name Resident Evil anymore, not even compared to RE4, which was much more survival horror-ish than this one.\n\ntl;dr:\n+ Good gameplay\n+ Co-op is fun\n+ Excellent graphics for a 2009 title\n+ Nice variety of weapons and upgrades\n+ Mercs is addicting\n\n- More action focused than RE4\n- Partner AI is horrible\n- Story has some weaker points\n- QTEs during cutscenes\n\nFinal verdict: 8.2/10","February 4","true","207.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

I can live with that.\n\nResident Evil 4 realised that the whole concept of the series was quite ludicrous, and went very over-the-top and was very obviously not taking itself that seriously. This game goes back and takes itself all too seriously again. Boo. The story is just too damn serious, and doesn't have any fun. Also it doesn't make much sense. But then the stories in Resi games have never been great, so I suppose that's not really a surprise.\n\nThe gameplay of this game was not particularly exciting, and certainly not very different to Resi 4 (but far better than that shocking Resi 4 PC port - play that on gamecube instead, or at least fix the PC version with mods). It looks perfectly fine and some of the puzzles are actually well done. There are far too many annoying quicktime bits though. Also parts of the final boss fight are absolutely stupid in co-op (whoever gets Sheva, I'm sorry you will be in so much pain due to that terrible button mash).\n\nFar from great, but not terrible either.

Resident Evil 5 is a Third-Person shooter/Horror game where you play once again as Chris Redfield, formerly of The original Resident Evil, Resident Evil Code Veronica and The Umbrella Chronicles, who partners with a woman named Sheva Alomar, which can be co-op played online or locally via split screen.

Chris is now a member of the BSAA, Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, who is on a mission to stop the sale of the progenitor bioweapon, which is a combination of the original T and G viruses.\n\nWithout giving away any more spoilers, I will say that Resident Evil 5, definitely looks good considering it is 7-years-old this year. Resident Evil 5 also has a survivors mode and a slayers mode, both being competitive multiplayer modes, as well as the traditional single player and Two-player co-op mode.

The graphics are pretty good for its time, no flaws there. The combat system it's not great but good enough and it's flaws can add to the survival and suspense tone of the game. But to get a good taste of that you need to play in the highest difficulties. The inventory systems is a bit clunky but you can make it work. I think they did a good job between the balance of combat and enemy AI. The mercenaries game mode is fun and challenging, but the DLC stories are too simple. In terms of story... it's not the best of the series but you can still feel the characters and enjoy them, especially if you know about the RE saga. With almost 200 hrs at the present time I can assure you that this game has a lot of replay value. Oh! and the soundtrack is awesome.\n\nPros:\n+ Co-op environment\n+ Enemy AI\n+ Replay value\n+ Combat\n+ Extra content\n+ Soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- Inventory system\n- Ally AI","December 31, 2015","true","165.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a great game but just didn't feel as much like a Resident Evil game as I was expecting. This game felt really difficult at times even on the easiest difficulty. Probably due to the fact that I suck at it and the computer A.I. certainly doesn't help. The A.I. can be pretty useless at times. Having a friend playing with you would solve that problem, I imagine.

Its like a cheesy action movie with scripted explosions, quick time events, and even a car chase. A bro-op action shooter that never stops delivering the action. Did I enjoy it? Hell ya those 70 hours spent on the game were mainly messing around with randoms online and even beating the game on professional. Mercenaries is also a main focus of Resident evil bringing out and showing the fun and varying combat system.\n\nStory: Its a cheesy action packed third person shooter following the footsteps of Chris and Sheva as they travel through Africa on a mission from the BSAA. Fighting against bioterrorism they fight local zombie like creatures and fight things that increase in size, bullet soaking power, and strength. Another virus is back to plague African villages and tribes with some randomly placed journals that tell deeper back stories on certain areas, people, and experiments. There is a lot of depth to the environment that resident evil 5 has laid out but its over shadowed by all those action sequences and over saturation of actions packed missions.\n\nGameplay: Suberb, Resident evil 5 really takes the cake as a co-op shooter. The only real problem I find in it is the quick time events that are absolutely annoying. You have a inventory system holding 9 possible objects of ammo, weapons, herbs, etc. You can find treasure to sell and use for money to upgrade weapons, buy new ones, and so much more. Shooting also has interesting aspects of being able to shoot enemies in the face, arm, or feet which will trigger 3 different types of melee attacks that you can choose. The depth and ability to perform combos is very interesting especially with a human controlled partner. This game play element is especially useful for mercenaries for comboing and extending time.\n\nThey also removed GFWL and added steamworks. I never really knew the problem with GFWL that everybody finds.\n\nIn conclusion, a great game in the aspect of game play. Capcom has really done it with this game Hardcore Resident Evil fans that wish the series would go back to its Horror roots will definitely be disappointed with this game. The story doesn't shine with anything interesting or new just overviewing another virus and some predictable plot points. Game play is great through the upgrade system, treasures, and melee attacks. Great to play with friends.\n\n7.5/10\nIf this game is on sale get it.

It's an action game. There are no save points, it's checkpoint based. All that is OK as long as your expectations are established. I played through this multiple times on PS3 and enjoyed the co-op aspect and wanted to experience it on PC with friends. Sadly co-op doesn't seem to work. I can't tell whether this is Capcom's fault or Microsoft's poor GFWL solution. There doesn't seem to be any support for this game anymore so neither Steam or Capcom can give me an explanation on why I keep getting "Game session canceled" when attempting to play co-op games.\n\nEdit: 3/6/2016: So GFWL is finally gone and replaced with steamworks and the co-op experience is now fully playable. It's hard for me to change my recommendation from NO to YES because of lame the story is, but when you're playing the RAID mode or through the campaign with a friend, it's definitely enjoyable. The game is definitely middle of the road when it comes to grading.","March 7, 2014","false","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Enemies suddenly become bullet sponges and you spend massive amounts of ammo either locking an enemy in an animation until it dies, or hoping to hit the tiny weak spot that will eventually kill it.\n\nI would not put a vote of confidence for single player, but if you're going to play with a friend through the cooperative mode, you'll probably have a good time and share a mutual feeling of "What the hell is going on?" when you realize you're playing a really crappy cover shooter instead of a Resident Evil game.\n\nI mean, I get it, I played RE4, and it was not quite a survival horror game either. However, this is just weird and I'm not sure what I really think about it. I totally understand why longtime Resident Evil fans despise this game to the core.\n\nAll that being said, I still had a decent time with this game, but it was quite the downward spiral from fun to what-the-hell?","December 5, 2015","true","14.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The story is very interesting with fun bosses and various enemies, has lots of replay value with different difficulties, collectibles, upgrades and of course achievements. The extra mode mercenaries lets you play alone or with a partner to survive and defeat as many enemies as possible within the time limit (being able to extend it breaking time bonuses) on numerous levels with different characters and costumes which I found addictively fun. Overall RE5 is a great game but I would recommend getting the gold edition to ANYONE who buys this as you will get so much more worth your money including mercenaries reunion (like mercenaries but with different characters and weapons not playable in the original version), Versus- which can be fun with friends but has clunky elements and not the best matchmaking + 2 DLC story modes with fan favourite Jill Valentine- 1 being a homage to RE1 and brings back survival horror while keeping the co-op and modern controls.\nThe ONLY real criticism I have for this game (more so the gold edition steam port than anything) is that there is quite a few bugs- occasionally enemies get stuck in mercenaries meaning you have to find them to kill them, the matchmaking is bad with private slots not functioning properly and automatically region locking who you play with [there is a mod which removes this however] and lobbies not being accurate. If capcom simply fixed these minor bugs this game would be perfect but they haven't addressed this and it's looking as though they won't with the last patch being over a year ago.","May 27","true","401.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The franchise has turned from a mindful game of puzzles and fun(horror, zombies, grotesque creatures out of a Lovecraftian terror) to a sad below expectations FPS. Resident Evil 4 had its spikes of worthwile gaming, but couldn't hold a candle to the others games, but at least as an FPS it held its own. This sad excuse for a FPS is a sad and downright depressing adventure for anyone who has loved the Biohazard/Resident Evil franchise.

It had a hefty development process dating all the way back to that concept trailer shown back in 2005 and it didn't even release until March 2009. Yes, originally it was just Chris but Capcom cashed in on how easy "co-op" appeal is and with the whole racist backlash (That would be 10x worse in 2015, thanks tumblr) they threw in Sheva. It's still one of the best looking games of last gen even compared to RE6 although that's not much of an achievement when you look at RE6. Good music, good atmospheric design - By this I mean it's got a really nice murky urban feeling in the early levels of the game as opposed to being scary, sure it's daylight but it's Africa what do you expect? Story/Scenario is really stupid though, you're following up on things we know nothing about and we never really see most characters outside of cutscenes also for some reason despite being veterans Chris and Jill are both low ranking officers in an organization they started.\n\nPlaying solo is a miserable experience having to babysit the AI and feed it your ammo and use your money to upgrade its weapons if you want it to keep up, the real experience in the game is the co-op. Having a responsive partner to use the voice commands given in the game adds to the whole co-operative nature of the game. Getting grabbed and being helped out then to quickly press a button to say "Thanks for the help" really makes it more satisfying that you have someone to assist you. The core gameplay itself hasn't changed too much from the series it's essentially "RE4 with co-op" having no typewriters anymore, no merchant what little remained of the core RE series to begin with is the tank controls. The controls themself take some getting used to and having being spoilt by RE6's masterful character control (The only good thing about the game) I had some difficulty playing it a while back but now it's out of my system I can easily manage playing it again.\n\nThe post-game content is serviceable, as you go through the game you're to acquire hidden emblems that unlock content for you with the more you amass. Be they files on all creatures and people in the game, filters for the game itself, small statues that detail the models of the game or even unlockable costumes to which both Sheva and Chris have 2 each of. The game also contains the series staple Mercenaries which started in RE3 and carried over to RE4 and now RE5. The DLC content is also largely worth it having two scenarios that fill in the missing pieces of the story a lot easier granted you even care about it, two more costumes for Chris and Sheva (Well, technically only 1 each on PC since you get the other set you got on consoles PC had already) and a remixed Mercenaries mode featuring two characters from RE5 and two old returning characters from the first game in the series.\n\nWith a fair amount of replay value and the likes or Mercs (provided the community is still alive) it's a game definitely worth your time even with all the flaws present the amount of time put into it is staggering compared to some of Capcom's later efforts.","April 4, 2015","true","40.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And now that it has made it's way to Steamworks, it deserves to be re-played. Of all the games I've played from the franchise, this one didn't deliver the horror experience I was looking for. The enemies did not appear particularly frightening, as well as the atmosphere wasn't creepy at all. The item machanism isn't balanced. You would have to decide and discard items in order to obtain more (total of nine slots.) Either increase the capacity of items you can carry in your arsenal, or spawn less items. The new Steamworks version of the game eliminated the support for Directx10. Wheather you have a low or high-end PC, you will be left with Directx9 as your renderer. Despite all that, the game never gets old and is still worth playing over and over again, especially with a partner.

As time goes by circumstances change and species either adapt or go extinct. Resident Evil 5 is all about evolution, both in content and in gameplay. It might not be what you want it be, but it works.\n\nResident Evil 5 is branded as the black sheep of the Resident Evil franchise. It is the installment where everything went overboard and everything that made Resident Evil, Resident Evil was replaced with elements that made it Gears of War. Resident Evil 5 is a third person shooter at heart and not a survival horror game. This polarised many fans of the series. Even at its darkest, Resident Evil 5 isn't scary. Unsettling at best, but you're so stacked on ammo and firepower at all times that you'll be hard pressed to actually fear for your life. So, in short, you'll be gunning your way through posessed villagers, various monsters and a broad assortment of bosses; and it is very enjoyable to do so.\n\nThe game drops you, Chris Redfield, Resident Evil 1 allumni, and Sheva Alomar, series newcomer and dark horse, in Africa where you're tasked to apprehend an arms dealer. Things quickly escalate when bio-weapons are involved and they're stronger and more advanced than anything seen before. The story proceeds to wrap up the ends brought forth in the earlier installments and pits you against an old enemy whose voice is arguably the sexiest baritone ever to grace the airwaves. The presentation and pace help sell the completely insane plot. If you're not an initated follower of Resident Evil  then you'll be dumbfounded. However, if you're in on the mania, than be prepared for a turbulent and explosive ride.\n\nGameplay is fast and agressive. The combat system actively encourages to get your hands dirty. And since you're accompanied by an AI partner, or possible coop player, you'll be dishing out pain left and right. The AI's aim is to be commended. While their inventory management leaves something to be desired, the computer player knows when to shoot and it makes it count. It helps you get past some of the more frustrating moments that much easier, allowing you to get back to work asap. And you'll be doing work. The shooting from Resident Evil 4 is back, but the enemies are more resiliant and they want your fist in their face. Chris' enormous biceps are going to show their worth when you get the hang of it.\n\nResident Evil 5 is a violent and agressive evolution of the game that Resident Evil 4 was. It isn't as revolutionary and some parts are bound to rub you the wrong way, but it is fun game to play. The viceral violence, the story and level design all add up to something really cool. Add to that some of the best action set pieces ever since they became a thing and you have a recipe for success.","June 3, 2015","true","29.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/21690/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Resident Evil 5 is a fun and frantic evolution of RE4's breakthrough gameplay and the series' horror themes.\n\nThirteen years ago, Capcom helped revolutionize the action adventure world with Resident Evil, a game that would define an entirely new genre dubbed "survival horror." In the years that followed, the series continued to build upon the standards set by the first game, Then, in 2005, Resident Evil 4 radically departed from its predecessors and broke new ground as a more action-oriented game. Resident Evil 5, the latest offering in the long-running series, expands on the action-heavy formula of its forerunner and is built from the ground up to support cooperative gameplay. Though it can no longer be considered a survival horror game, Resident Evil 5 manages to retain and effectively translate the most important aspect of that genre--tension--into its new mechanics. It crafts a fun, collaborative experience that will keep you on your toes the entire time.\n\nHaving two agents in the field lets you team them up to trade weapons or push dumpsters.\nTen years after the destruction of Raccoon City, former S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team member Chris Redfield is an agent of the B.S.A.A. This paramilitary anti-bio-organic weapons organization travels the globe to seek out and destroy Umbrella Corporation's creations, which have fallen into the hands of terrorists following the collapse of the multinational pharmaceutical company. When Chris gets a tip that a known weapons dealer will be making a big deal in the remote African nation of Kijuju, he heads there to put a stop to it and learn what he can about the mysterious doomsday project known only as Uroboros. Chris is joined by Sheva Alomar, a local B.S.A.A. agent, and together they battle wave after wave of infected villagers, horribly mutated monsters, and even series archnemesis, Albert Wesker.\n\nThe core combat mechanics haven't fundamentally changed since Resident Evil 4. The action still unfolds from an over-the-shoulder perspective, certain battles or cutscenes are accompanied by brief quick-time events, and you still have to stop moving to fire your weapon (though you gain a bit more mobility thanks to your newfound ability to walk sideways). Resident Evil 5's slow movement and gunplay take some time to get used to, and folks expecting a run-and-gun game may find the action too sluggish for their tastes. Fortunately, this slowness isn't really an issue within the game, because enemies are deliberate with their attacks and are better handled with a cool head and steady aim. Though the Xbox 360 controller is fully supported, the standard keyboard/mouse combo offers vastly superior aiming precision and control, which makes it by far the better option.\n\nRegardless of how similar the combat in Resident Evil 5 is to its predecessor, the addition of a second character makes encounters feel quite different. Teamwork is necessary to take down more powerful enemies and bosses, and having someone to watch your back goes a long way toward keeping you alive. Furthermore, there have been radical changes made to the inventory management system. The immersion-breaking briefcase from the previous game is gone, and enemies no longer politely wait for you to rummage through your things because bringing up your armory doesn't pause the action. Each character can store up to nine items, and as long as you properly organize your inventory using the simple click-and-drag interface, all of your items are only a single keystroke away, which offers an unprecedented level of accessibility to your gear. It's often necessary to trade items with your partner, and keeping track of who has what at all times is crucial, especially during boss encounters.\n\nInventory management is easier than ever when you can click and drag items around with your mouse.\nSheva's artificial intelligence makes her a competent companion, though her degree of skill seems to rely more on her armaments than anything else. She is extremely good at using burst fire with a machine gun, for example, but she tends to waste ammo when equipped with a handgun. That said, at no point does she feel like extra baggage that needs babysitting (unlike some of the series' previous companions), and she can hold her own in a fight. Sheva really shines when there's someone else controlling her. Resident Evil 5 supports online co-op play through Games for Windows Live, and exploring Kijuju with a friend greatly enhances both the experience and the fun factor. Every game has the potential to go multiplayer, since other online players can join in on a free-for-all or invite-only basis if your game session is set up to allow this from the get-go.\n\nDespite these conveniences, there are some frustrating hurdles that need to be leaped over before a partner can begin playing. Co-op isn't drop-in, so if someone joins, gameplay is interrupted and immersion is broken to some degree because the player who joined has to sit on the sidelines until the host either restarts or continues on to the next checkpoint. Another major problem is that players' main inventories are isolated from one another, and though you can trade healing items and ammunition, weapons are off-limits for exchange, making some battles more difficult if you're playing with a partner who is not as well equipped as you.\n\nThat's it for today. Be sure to read the chapter on gun maintenance--you WILL be tested!\nResident Evil 5 isn't a survival horror game, but that doesn't mean it hasn't learned a great deal from the genre. Tension is the central element of survival horror games, and in the past, tension has been conveyed by the gloomy settings, the sense of isolation, and the frustratingly clunky camera angles and controls. All RE5 does differently is convey this feeling through other outlets. Having a partner introduces new types of tension, because you're forced to rely on each other's support, find ways to manage both of your inventories during battles, and cover larger areas since enemies can appear from almost anywhere. Waves of enemies wax and wane with just the right frequency, and while the brightly lit environments make them less scary, they can be tough to deal with because they attack in large numbers and are smarter, faster, and stronger than their counterparts in previous games. Major encounters and boss fights are doled out with excellent pacing, and since you're never sure what to expect around the corner, you have to remain vigilant.\n\nRE5 is one of the most visually stunning games available, and its huge variety of environments is meticulously detailed in every way. There are lots of large, open areas, and you'll constantly be on the move through them since there are usually so many enemies. In-game cutscenes are top-notch (though sometimes a bit over-the-top), and Chris and Sheva are incredibly well animated, especially their faces. If you happen to have the right collection of equipment, you can also take advantage of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology to experience Resident Evil 5 in stereoscopic 3D. The dialogue is often full of the trademark goofiness found in the series. The voice acting is competent, and when paired with the excellent facial expressions, it breathes a great deal of realism into the characters. Likewise, the fantastic orchestral soundtrack heightens the gameplay with everything from the low-key, ambient tracks that play during downtimes to the frantic, upbeat songs that accompany the massive boss battles.\n\nTHE GOOD\nBeautifully detailed graphics and character animations\nHaving a partner enhances the fun and excitement while adding tension\nReal-time menu system keeps you immersed\nPlenty to do once you've beaten it\nSuperior keyboard/mouse controls\n\nTHE BAD\nFrustrating hurdles to leap when joining an online game\nSlow, deliberate movement and gunplay may not appeal to everyone\nCan't swap weapons with a human teammate online\n\n8.5","March 28, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Having only foggy childhood memories of Resident Evil 2 on my old Nintendo 64 and a close friend's dedication to the series holding me back, I can still say I understand why.\n\nIt is no secret that I am one for action games with good tempo and flow; the countless hours I've invested into Payday, E.Y.E., and Killing Floor speak volumes. I am no stranger to horror; I've played the far ends of the spectrum in Amnesia and Penumbra, Dead Space and STALKER. Even as restrained as I can be, I can say wholeheartedly that Resident Evil 5 struck none of the high notes that any of those titles - for all the hours and playthroughs they've offered me - have achieved.\n\nWhile undoubtedly far in advance of the fixed camera perspective I recall from Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 5's combat hit me as clunky, backwards, and bizarrely slow. Clunky, where the player is rooted to the ground while firing and is most often required to use slow-firing manual and semiautomatic weapons. Backwards, where headshots are passively discouraged by the early introduction of particular reactions to headshots. Bizarrely slow, where mentioned focus on pistols and pump-action shotguns combines with a dawdling enemy pace that would make some of my slowest games in strategy titles seem like they were taking place at superluminal velocity.\n\nStorywise, I doubt I have ever cringed as much as I have through the course of watching Resident Evil 5's plot. It is easily the most unashamedly cheesy and melodramatic game I have ever played, bereft of humor and serious to a fault. In some cases, I saw plot elements coming from miles away. In others, I could feel the word "why" trying to beat its way out of my skull. Particularly, a character is introduced early on with all the subtlety and rationality in design as a tank skydiving into a ballpit. As the plot continued to thicken, I could feel my "immersion" - had I even pretended to carry any - shrivel further and further.\n\nBogging down gameplay and storytelling yet more are the absurdly numerous and absurdly lengthy quick-time events that sometimes boggled the mind as to why they even existed. Events such as the player characters running down hallways became, at some points, interactive cutscenes, rather than allowing player control and offering meaningful challenges over button mashing contests and keyboard (or controller) attention checks. While I do not deny that Dead Space - oft-compared and of similar genre definition - featured many of its own quick-time events, I feel much more confident in their role and value than I do Resident Evil 5's.\n\nThe game is not without its strengths, of course - I don't deal in absolutes. Balance, both in supply hurdles and enemies, is well laid-out. Graphical quality is astonishing for an early 2009 game. Voice acting, though given material I find questionable to follow, is done well. High marks are also to be given for its stability, though it should be known that I and a close friend encountered a gamebreaking, though eventually resolved bug at the very end of the game. Multiplayer features offer some replayability, but unfortunately play to one of the game's weak suits - its combat - outside of regular cooperative play.\n\nIn conclusion, however, these strengths did little to sway me. I found little to enjoy in the game besides my closest friend's company and my opportunity to grant her the happiness of continuing one of her favorite game series. While others may disagree with my opinions, I can say honestly that the game offered little to my tastes but a basic marksmanship course.","December 7, 2013","false","32.8"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","26","50","0","0"

Whilst there were some complaints from the diehards, the overwhelming census was that the franchise's break away from fixed camera was for the best. Whilst their recent titles Code Veronica and Resident Evil 0 were decent enough, but not amazing, RE4 found audiences every bit as awe struck by the game as they were when they first stepped foot in Spenser Manor in 1996. The franchise looked onward to a bright new future that whilst certainly would leave its survival horror roots behind, would immerse it's audience in a detailed 3D world with tight new gunplay as they fought back overwhelming hordes of Mexicans Spaniards.\nAlas, the dream was too good to be true. RE5 was merely a mediocre third person shooter with nothing more than an arbitrary RE universe story featuring some familiar faces. The fantastic difficulty balance and pacing of the battles seen in its predecessor  were absent, and the distinctly Japanese over the top story and set pieces were replaced with Western feeling low key blandness. Whilst some areas such as the swampy island area offered enjoyable large scale battles, much of the game was spent trudging down corridors spraying a continual stream of bullets.\nThe biggest upside to this title is that coop mode plays very well, and overcoming a difficult spot with teamwork on the harder difficulties feels very rewarding. Also, it means you won't have to put up with the immersion breaking ai ineptitude of Sheva.\n\nSpear-chucking Mud Men out of Ten\n\n***Fun Stuff for RE Fans***\nCheck out where the series really got it's root's from by playing Sweet Home on the NES (or at least an English rom on an emulator...). It's a survival horror RPG in which a team of characters explore a haunted mansion (which is refereed to as a 'House of Residing Evil'!). You have limited inventory space, one character has a permanent lock pick, one has a permanent lighter, and the only way to heal if to carry the limited number of inventory hogging healing items you find. Also, doors open slowly in first person. Any of that sound familiar to veterans of the series? Its a far better, and far scarier experience than RE5!","November 25, 2013","false","12.2"," 29 of 56 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","29","56","0","5"

The media bashed the game before it even saw the light of day for It's racism towards the African people that the trailers showed. Once the game came out, you heard no more complaints about racisim. What you had, was another pretty good Resident Evil game.\nThe story is your standard Resident Evil tale, Wesker is up to no good and its up to (Chris) and his new partner (Sheva) to stop him. The combat can be exciting tho still feels trapped in the past, Not being able to walk and shoot is a small complaint, but Dead Space has showed us how important it is and it just makes sence. Now with a friend this game can be pretty amazing at time, tho playing solo, it feels like the AI is holding you back and is only good for using as a second inventory.\nIf you have a friend to play this with and can get passed some of the old trappings this series still faces, you'll be in for a fun time.\nPersonal Rating: 4/5\n","August 8, 2011","true","36.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyway, Resident Evil 5 is like a cornerstone that marks the transition. It's a great game, indeed, but maybe Capcom forgets that while a cooperative game (or single-player with a partner) can be a bit scary, it can't be that much of a horror game than when player is alone.\nRecommended to play with a friend.","December 22, 2013","true","20.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The dialogue sends me into fits of laughter. And the boss fights are fantastic fun. Sure, it's hardly a survival horror at this point, but to me the original games were never really all that scary to begin with (they ain't Silent Hill, that's for sure).

You still have to stand still to shoot, but fans of the series should be used to this by now.\n\nOnline play - The co-op main campaign is amazing, other modes are all right.

Recently I've bought Resident Evil 6 to play with and was more than pleased with the game mechanics, cutscenes, voice acting and more action-orentied gameplay (with both tight and fluid keyboard and mouse controls) than classic chapters of Resident Evil. I played all the classic chapters on PC and PSX and always loved the franchise, either it was a horror-survival or action-survival game. After beating Resident Evil 6, getting all the achievements, all skills and all of other stuff, I wanted to try the preceding chapter, so I bought Resident Evil 5 second time, now both the main game and the gold edition add-on to have this game with Steamworks support. Turned out that the game is actually better than sequel and more fun too, I've beaten the game on all four difficulties with S-rank, I bought and upgraded almost all weapons, now heading to get all those achivements. Back to the game - the camera is under your full control, no annoying "director" in your way like in RE6, way less QTE moments but they look awkward on keyboard. You cannot walk while shoot (remember - I've already played Dead Space and Resident Evil 6 at this moment) but the devs were taking it into account so it works really well. The only drawback is your AI partner, which can be pretty annoying on Professional difficulty - you'll be hearing "Shevaaa!" a lot as she will die from the sunbeam in 4th chapter most of the time. Damn, it pisses me off, believe me. Oh, and it consumes my ammo - shame on you, Capcom, it's mine - get your dirty hands off it! And QTE moments - while RE6 has a ton of it, they feels ok - good luck becaming a pro in pressing F+V in RE5. All of this cons were addressed and corrected in RE6 but still RE5 is better game almost in any way. Maybe the multiplayer section and the mercenaries is better in RE6. The major difference is that the RE5 is more a game rather than "playable movie" style of RE6. I suggest you to buy both games and play RE6 first. The game is more than good. It's not the best way to follow the games' storylines but I played this way and after completing both games it doesn't really matter which one came first. And then play RE5, which is awesome. If you tend to play with the gamepad I suggest you to play Resident Evil 4 which is also a very good game and, as they say, better than both RE5 and RE6, but suffering from bad keyboard and mouse controls support, even in HD re-release, and I don't possess the Xbox controller. Yet. Oh, and I hate to save on typewriters, don't know why though, as it doesn't require the precious ink ribbon in RE4.","October 26, 2015","true","91.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoomDash/recommended/21690/","DoomDash","DoomDash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoomDash/","252 products in account","When Resident Evil 5 launched, I avoided buying it. I thought the direction of the series was headed in the wrong direction. I said to myself "co-op?!? colorful bright lighting!?!?" and basically dismissed the game for a few months. I forget the reasons, but six months later I finally picked it up. I played the game single player, finished it, and never really fell in love with it. I was indifferent about the game.\n\nA month or so later and I decided to play it co-op with a guy I met on some forums, who happens to be one of the biggest RE fans I've ever met. He has already played the crap out of RE5, so he has a ton of game knowledge about RE5. I wanted to get the Platinum (PS3), so we played on Professional, which is the very hard setting in the game. This time, I completely got it. Everything about the co-op experience was extremely fun! This game ended up being the co-op game I always wanted as a kid growing up. Teamwork was important (especially on hard settings), and playing with friends added a brand new experience to a series I already loved.\n\nFinding all the treasures, upgrading weapons, and the constant high pressure of action horror was extremely fun, challenging, and rewarding. Top that off with some great boss fights, and some extremely good story with some of Resident Evil's best characters. Even the QTE's in this game were fun in co-op! They didn't feel out of place, and if you failed them with your buddies, it always ended up being a laughing affair, especially the next time when they mixed the buttons up on you!\n\nThe game didn't have that dark setting of the previous titles, but it still had its own mood and unqiue setting. As I mentioned above, this game had an excellent co-op system. The combos you could perform with your partner added a welcomed mechanic to the series, expanding on 4's action prompts. The boss battles worked really well with your partners too, both of you generally  had to work together and do something unique together to end the boss. Wesker in this game was particullarly bad ♥♥♥ too.\n\nAnyway, I could go on and on about how RE5 is great, yeah it's not survival horror, but it's a fantastic action horror game, and one of the greatest co-op experiences I've had in gaming period.\n\n**Play with your best friends, and play on the hardest setting you can!!!**","August 28, 2011","true","37.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was indifferent about the game.\n\nA month or so later and I decided to play it co-op with a guy I met on some forums, who happens to be one of the biggest RE fans I've ever met. He has already played the crap out of RE5, so he has a ton of game knowledge about RE5. I wanted to get the Platinum (PS3), so we played on Professional, which is the very hard setting in the game. This time, I completely got it. Everything about the co-op experience was extremely fun! This game ended up being the co-op game I always wanted as a kid growing up. Teamwork was important (especially on hard settings), and playing with friends added a brand new experience to a series I already loved.\n\nFinding all the treasures, upgrading weapons, and the constant high pressure of action horror was extremely fun, challenging, and rewarding. Top that off with some great boss fights, and some extremely good story with some of Resident Evil's best characters. Even the QTE's in this game were fun in co-op!

Occasionally the video will have collision issues causing the screen to completely screw up making it impossible to see anything in the game.

I enjoyed the campaign so much im playing it again. Yes the AI for Sheva may be clumsy from time to time so you may be better off playing with a friend. There is also collectable emblems which unlocks costumes for Chris and Sheva.\n\nBonus Modes.\nThere isn't that many bonus modes added in Resident Evil 5 but the mercenaries mode is enjoyable. They have also added a No Mercy mode just for PC. There is plenty of maps to play on the mercenaries mode and it is replayable as you can feel like you can get a much better score than your previous score. In the story mode you start off with 3 difficulties. Once you complete veteren mode you unlock professional mode which just seems darn impossible.\n\nVerdict.\nResident Evil 5 may not be like the other Resident Evil game but it is a fun one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/21690/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick rundown: Resident Evil 5 continues the evolution of the Resident Evil series into more action than horror. If you’ve played Resident Evil 4 and wanted better controls, better graphics, and more gunfire, you’ll enjoy RE 5. They’ve also refined the combat system so you don’t spend as much time knifing people lying on the ground because ammo is a lot less of a problem this time around (overall). You still run out of ammo in the middle of some missions, but you can quit and reload, getting access to your stash. Note that RE 5 is the kind of game you where you can keep load and replay specific chapters to grind for money and ammo. If you have a co-op partner the game is much more fun since the entire campaign can be played with a friend (or a stranger). Games for Windows Live has been stripped out of the Steam version by the way, but it’s not perfectly done.\n\nThe game’s story follows Chris Redfield as he battles his way through various hostile environments in Africa with his new partner Sheva. Chris is an officer in the BSAA, investigating the apparent use of bioweapons in the area, and by bioweapon I don’t mean Ebola or Super Aids. Ouroboros is a world ending super virus aimed at culling the “inferior” humans from the planet (by adding their biomass to giant monsters). Most of Chris’ enemies seems to be infected with the Las Plagas parasite that Leon Kennedy encountered in Resident Evil 4, turning people into slow moving “rage zombies” that follow the orders of mysterious bad guys. That’s not all though since the virus can also cause grotesque mutations, and advanced versions can create monstrous giant bosses. If you’ve watched the Resident Evil movie series or played the previous games, you’ll recognize the big boss of Resident Evil 5, and even some of the fight scenes seem to have been ripped off for the movies.\n\nLike Resident Evil 4, this game is played in third person but unlike part 4, Resident Evil 5 was built with 2-player co-op in mind.  Throughout the campaign, you play either Chris or Sheva, and the computer AI (or a friend) controls the other character. Sheva is unlocked for single player after beating the game but can be played immediately in co-op. You’ll be fighting side by side 95% of the time but occasionally split up in scripted areas. During these short periods, you’ll be much more vulnerable because not only do you not have a partner covering your back, you also don’t have anyone to revive you if you take too much damage and go down.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier you get a lot more ammunition in this game than in RE 4, which means you’ll be shooting a lot more as well. Be warned that your computer controlled partner fires their weapons a lot, possibly eating up all your ammo. Both characters have their own 9 slot inventory and can freely swap items between them. Between levels, you have the opportunity to modify your inventory by moving things into a persistent “stash” that can hold infinite items. This way, you can always start a level with what you need and don’t have to sell off your stuff to make room like in RE 4. In RE 4 your inventory was just too small to hold all the guns and ammo. I also mentioned before that you can replay levels at will, which means if you know there’s lots of ammo or money in a certain level you can farm it over and over. By the end you should have more ammo than you will ever need, but money (for upgrading guns) will always be in short supply.\n\nPros:\n+Great game for co-op if you have a friend that you want to play through the campaign with. The game allows you to save your inventory separately when you quit a level. This means if you realize you’ve wasted too much ammo and want to quit without saving, you can. This also means you can start a level, grab all the goodies in the starting area, and save + quit.\n+Faster paced than Resident Evil 4. I enjoy action games, and RE 5 plays a lot more like Dead Space, where you need to constantly be on your guard against getting mobbed. Aiming, reaction speed, and choosing your next move in the thick of combat (take advantage of invincibility animations!) are all important skills.\n+Excellent graphics (horrible monsters) and a decent storyline. You also get the Mercenaries mini game unlocked after beating the campaign. You can spend a lot of time on this game mode.\n\nCons:\n-You will need to replay some levels to get the money/ammo necessary to advance in the game. I didn’t mind because I like farming for items, but some people may not appreciate that you HAVE TO replay levels during your first playthrough. It takes about 15 hours to beat the game because of all the replay, even though actually running through each level would probably end the game in about 5 hours.\n-The game was formerly tied to Games for Windows Live, and even though that requirement has been stripped out of the Steam version, it still tries to launch GFWL on startup of the game. Steam gives you a product key to enter for GFWL, except the GFWL doesn’t exist. There’s also a little DOS window that says something about module not found every time I play the game. This is just a minor annoyance, but it seems like something they ought to have fixed.\n-Alas, a lot of the game’s Steam achievements are tied to the DLC Untold Stories, which costs almost as much as the base game.\n\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun, and if you get into it you can spend 25 hours easily just unlocking all the weapons, and even more playing the Mercenaries mode. You’ll enjoy the experience a lot more with a co-op partner than by yourself.\n","February 17","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The smooth co-op factor made this stand out quite a bit, aside from the occasional connection issues due to running windows live through steam and what not, though works brilliantly the rest of the time.\n\nNow, as for story-line, I really did enjoy the fact it didn't go for the stereotypical crew of Leon, Ada etc, as much as I love those characters, I find there wasn't ever enough about Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar (A local BSAA agent), though maybe that is just me. This game revolves around Chris and Sheva's investigation of a terrorist threat in Kijuju, a fictional place in Africa, giving it a really nice rural environment from the get go.\n\nThrough the RE games, they seemed to lose their horror and survival aspect, but RE 5 manages to bring back a eerie tension with it's mechanics, keeping you on your toes from start to finish. I loved this. The boss fights were actually quite intense, a little bit creepy when you are being chased down in tight area's and with little ammo to spare and find, after all, you don't just find random clips of ammo lying down in the real world, do you?\n\nEnemies no longer politely wait for you to rummage through your things either, because bringing up your armory doesn't pause the action, which brings back the survival feeling to the game, because if you aren't carefully watching when going through your inventory to switch between weapons, you will die. Also, the fact you can't carry THAT many weapons compared to a lot of games which take an RPG and a range of other weapons and just put them in their back pocket to continue sprinting and running like nothing.\n\nIt brings some amazing visuals and a few enhancements, In other words, kind of like what RE3 was to RE2. The monsters aren't that imaginative, though lickers get brought back!\n\nTo the action aspect, your partner can revive you, relatively quick weapon swapping, colossal bosses and the horror-ish aspect is pulled off with limited controls and the classic over-the-shoulder view, an inventory system that doesn't pause to make enemies wait whilst you ready yourself for them and some pretty intense puzzle solving whilst trying to stay alive.\n\nIn all, amazing game, loved the new mechanics, great co-op and the revamp of the creepy horror, survival aspects.\n","September 30, 2014","true","28.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sadly, the appeal of those things are.. well.. gone, with this version.\n\nSure, it was a fun run through but the lack of friends actually owning this port left me playing by myself. Which is good, but not nearly as fun as with someone else. That, and this version lacks the DLC all together.

The DLC that was released recently is what got me to really start playing. I really want to check out those DLC levels that take you back to the Spencer Estate. The game itself is very fast paced but the battles are fun once you get the hang of the inventory being used while in game instead of essentially pausing the game as in previous games. This adds challenge while also making the game that much more in the moment. The flaw of this game is the AI of your CPU partner. The only real way to play this is with a friend in co-op mode. I would recommend this game if you're like me and have to have everything Resident Evil. However, if you don't like what you've seen of the game and how fast paced it is, you may not think very highly of it.","September 30, 2014","true","70.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Worth buying just for the mercenaries modes.\n\nHawthorne School of Aeronautics is a closed flying school/airport located 5 miles south of Orangeburg, South Carolina. The school was closed in 1945. Today the land is being used for non-aviation purposes.\n\nThe Hawthorne School of Aeronautics was a World War II civilian flying school, contracted by the United States Army Air Forces to conduct primary pilot training for aviation cadets. The school was under the supervision of the 58th Flying Training Detachment, Eastern Flight Training Center, Army Air Forces Training Command. The president of Hawthorne was Beverly "Bevo" Howard, who had learned to fly at the age of 16. The military designation of the Hawthorne school was the 2162nd Army Air Force Base Unit.\n\nIn order to conduct the flying training, the school built an airfield along with buildings and other support structures. The airfield was an all-way turf field, with four delineated runways (00/18; 05/23; 09/27; 14/32). A large aircraft parking ramp and two hangars was also constructed along with a control tower and operations building. The school structures consisted of a group of one and two-storied wooden buildings surrounding an oval-shaped grass area at the northern end of the property which served as a parade ground.\n\nAt the end of 1944, training of Free French pilots was transferred from Hargrove Van de Graaft Airport, Tuscaloosa, Alabama to Hawthorne. The unit was inactivated on 1 September 1945. During the Second World War, Hawthorne trained 5,924 military pilots, including more than 2,000 French Air Force students. For his leadership, Bevo Howard was presented the French Air Force Wings, the coveted French Medaille de L'Aeronautique, and later the Ordre National de la Légion d'honneur for his pilot training and accomplishments as an aerobatic flyer.\n\nThe Hawthorne School of Aeronautics ceased operations at Orangeburg with the end of the war, however it went on to continue operations at Jacksonville, Florida, and Moultrie, Georgia. The firm eventually became the large Piedmont-Hawthorne chain of aviation Fixed Base Operators.\n\nThe airport was closed after the war, and was abandoned. The two hangars from the flying school were relocated at some point to the Orangeburg Municipal Airport at which there is also an excellent historical display of the activities of the Hawthorne school.","January 25","true","35.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","3"

Its been released 3 times for gods sake. I didnt really enjoy 4 and  Leon is my least favourite character ever\n\nResi 5 doesnt have the horror of the first few games but thats not a reason to not buy 5. 5 is a gem on its own.\n\nThe story is cheesy but in a good way. The locations are great through out the game, always changing. The characters are fantastic although Sheva does start to get a little annoying towards the end.\n\nPeople often complain about how and why Chris is so beefy. I mean c'mon, he's got Albert f*cking Wesker as a nemesis! Chris got his ♥♥♥ handed to him back in Code Veronica!\n\nAnyway, all in all this game is fantastic. Its got a ton of replay value. The weapons upgrading is a neat little system that will keep you busy. There's also Mercenaries when you've finished the story and that will keep you occupied for days. And as Im writing this review, Steam achievements have just been added and they include all DLC achievements too.\n\nSo when Resi 5 is moved to steamworks, you'll have even more content to play with!\n\nLost in Nightmares is fantastic, it tells the story of when Chris and Jill went to find Ozwell E Spencer and is creepy as hell.\n\nDesperate Escape is just as good too, telling you how Josh and Jill escaped near the end.\n\nThen theres also Mercenaries Reunion and Versus mode. There is an absolute ton to do on this game. I've 100% this game at least 5 times and I'd gladly do it all over again.\n\nIf you dont mind the missing element of survival horror then get this entry, for the love of god man.\n\nThank me later.\n\nSaturation/10","February 20, 2015","true","71.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Sadly these are so bad I can only give it 3 out of 5, which is a real shame.\n\n3/5","December 1, 2013","true","29.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Visually, it holds up very well, despite being 5 years old now. It was commonly used as a benchmark for GPUs.\n\nMost of the classic mechanics are here. The Capcom philosophy of survival horror, that is, creating difficulty through sluggish control, is bad design, but somehow it works here. Of course, unlike in many modern games, health does not regenerate. You also have your infernal inventory in which to store your weapons and items.\n\nThe game really shines in co-op such that I'd say it's the best way to play it for the first time. Aside from one or two uninspired boss encounters as well as some more minor gripes, any masochist will enjoy this game.","November 29, 2014","true","13.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Let me explain to you why RE5 is NOTHING compared to RE4.\n\nI enjoyed RE4 immensely, I've played it hours and completed it 100% on all difficulties. After reading a few (in hindsight VERY MISLEADING) reviews, thought I'd enjoy RE5 as well. But boy was I wrong.\n\nFirst of all, there's no story. Or nearly no story. You just go from A to B and shoot things. Don't expect an intriguing story like I did, having played RE4 before. After a few chapters it'll get very repetitive.\nAlso, there's no creepy, scary feel to the game. Everything seems to be in broad daylight, there wasn't even a single point in the game that I was hesitant/too scared to progress. Just run and shoot, easy.\n\nSecond, while the overall controls are similar to RE4, which I like, they now put in a HORRIBLE inventory system. Not only does it look and feel very very cheap and unfinished, it's more of a hassle than an additional challenge of good inventory management, like it was in RE4.\n\nThird, the bosses and enemies are just, so, boring. It's like they used the least imaginative, probably cheapest, artists to create the monsters and bosses. Just expect slimy black tentacles. Yey.\nAnd I could've accepted this boring monster-design fact, if these bosses would at least prove a challenge to kill. But no, they threw in gatling guns everywhere to kill the bosses. You don't even have to rely on your gunmanship skills anymore, you just point and shoot with the gatling gun. YAWN.\n\nFourth, I expect they ran out of ideas, because they just filled in some levels with vehicles: drive a jeep and shoot a gatling gun. Urgh. Steer a ship and shoot a gatling gun. Sigh. Stand on a deck and shoot a gatling gun. Whoop.\n\nFifth: there aren't any cool weapons in this game. Each weapon feels like you're holding a toy gun, they don't sound good, they don't look good. And the upgrades aren't interesting like they were in RE4, because there aren't even exclusive upgrades anymore when maxing out your gun!\n\nThe only thing I really enjoyed in this game is the melee attacks you can perform with your buddy online. Stun an enemy, punch him in the face. And if it's a stronger enemy, you can both unleash your melee actions on it, for even greater damage. Aaand that's really about the only positive thing I have to say about this game.\n\nSo I think I'm clear: RE4 fans, don't do this to yourself, don't buy this game. Even the multiplayer, which is the reason why I bought this game, doesn't make up for all it's flaws.\n\nIt's like a mental cringe, each time you discover how bad it is compared to RE4.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/21690/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","So, I heard a lot of stories about this game and they weren't good ones. "It's not Resident Evil anymore" they said. "Resident Evil 4 is better than this" they said. "Every Resident Evil after the 4th iteration is bad" they said. And what can I say? They're not right. It's as simple as that.\n\nAs harsh as this truth may be, Resident Evil has shifted its focus from classic survival horror to a more action oriented gameplay experience. But this already happened after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. The fixed camera angles are missing in favor of a 3rd person perspective, the classic zombies from the first three games are no more and the story of the Umbrella corporation ended long before the setting of Resident Evil 4. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Resident Evil 5, just like it's predecessor, is more action oriented than the classic Resident Evil titles.\n\nIn fact, a lot of people liked Resident Evil 4, but the fifth iteration wasn't all that well received. And I am asking myself: why is that? To me, Resident Evil 5 has numerous changes that made it better than it's predecessor. The controls on PC are marvelous compared to Resident Evil 4, the graphics are more advanced, some animations are nicer, the mercenaries mode is better and it features some new enemies. But I also have to say that Resident Evil 5 plays a lot like Resident Evil 4.\n\nA lot of the animations are recycled or reused, especially those for the Majini (which are basically reskinned Ganados from Resident Evil 4), it is still not possible to move whilst shooting and it just feels like Resident Evil 4, the only real change being the setting in Africa (so you're fighting against black Ganados, kind of) and the partner-mechanic, allowing for co-op or a single player mode with benefits (or annoyances). Well, the UI's different, too. Especially the inventory. It's gotten pretty small actually, compared to the Resident Evil 4 inventory when maxed out. You got nine inventory slots in total which means that you can only afford to take 3 weapons with you at most, I recommend carrying 2 weapons for each character so that you can still fit in first aid spray/herbs and grenades - or a bullet proof vest.\n\nAlso, the merchant from Resident Evil 4 is gone, that iconic figure. You will be missed. Aside from that, the health bar system is different, too. Instead of featuring a segmented bar which can be increased by consuming yellow herbs in combination with green herbs and red herbs, you have a full bar with a set amount of health - rendering the yellow herb obsolete in the process, which is why it was removed.\n\nBut aside from all this... Resident Evil 5 plays like Resident Evil 4 - just a little bit more simplified and with better looks. The puzzles, the combat, movement, boss battles and most of the animations are still the same. And what can I say? I liked Resident Evil 4 for what it was. The PC port was a horrible mess but I liked it nontheless. And so, Resident Evil 5 is also a game I would call a "nice game". Not outstandingly great by any means. It's a 3rd person action shooting game in the Resident Evil universe.\n\nFans of the original games won't like Resident Evil 5 nor will they like Resident Evil 4 all that much. But if you don't give a damn about the "true Resident Evil experience" and just want to play a nice 3rd person shooter with mutants and zombies in it, featuring some of your favourite characters from the Resident Evil universe and a bit of interesting lore, I recommend this game to you.

This game would be much more fun if they did not use very old game mechanics.  In today's gaming, no one wants to see an animation of picking up gun bullets for the 30th time in 5 mins, should get it by being near it ect.  Almost the combat feels sluggish in an attempt to make you feel powerless, they could have counterd this with a built in hand to hand combat system alike "Condemed Criminal Origins".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heroictofu/recommended/21690/","heroictofu","HeroicTofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heroictofu/","181 products in account","Resident Evil 5 is very much a love it or hate it part of the Resident Evil franchise. There are many reasons for this, most notably starting with Resident Evil 4 and the series departure from pure scare tactics into a more story driven, fight off zombie hordes sort of affair.\n\nI find that this sort of evolution actually makes sense as the games stay contained within the same universe. When zombies, the c-virus, las plagas, etc become common knowledge, it becomes much harder for the characters in that world to become outright scared. This also translates to the players growing up with the games. Whether it was the dogs jumping through windows in Resident Evil 1, the menacing lickers of RE2 or the constant stress of being hunted down by Nemesis in RE3, we've grown up with this series and it's very hard to throw a curve ball at us. We aren't the 10-14 year olds with wild imaginations anymore.\n\nSo with Resident Evil 5, it follows the natural course of, we know there are weird creatures afoot, it's down to us to locate the source to try and put an end to it. And I find the story telling and voice acting to be very well done. It can be a bit campy but Resident Evil 5 wasn't going for a "The Last of Us" feel or story narrative.\n\nNow when it comes to gameplay, I actually find it to be somewhat more realistic than many of the shooters and FPS games out there. You are not controlling a platoon of soldiers, you are two trained mercenaries (for all intents and purposes), using strategic fire to subdue your enemies. An argument could be made that you should be able to move and fire at the same time, however in most military skirmishes, soldiers will set themselves up for a shot then move to the next vantage point. Shooting and moving, little own running, at the same time greatly diminishes accuracy and wastes ammo. With this in mind, the enemy AI is designed for this sort of combat. At no time in the game do I feel that because of this style of combat, I am severely limited/hindered as a result. I adapt to the gameplay, learn it's nuances and continue on. I enjoy it!\n\nYou might look at my hours count here and think that I might be off base a bit or not enough experience with the game to make a full review such as this. However, I started off the with 360 version of the game, got the PS3 version, and now the PC version. Graphically, the PC version is much more impressive especially with the improved framerates. Not having as many friends on Steam versus PS3 or 360, I tended to play the console versions more often. Which leads to my one complaint towards the game.\n\nYour companion AI can be somewhat infuriating at times compared to playing with a real person and being able to speak your mind in voice chat on how to go about business. While the AI never truly outright fails, their waste of ammo and poor timing of healing items amongst other things can lead to moments of pure frustration, especially at the earlier parts of game and before you complete the game and can start unlocking all sorts of wonderful features (including unlimited ammo leading to your partner never wasting ammo again).\n\nIn any case, I love this game, have played it many, many, many times and will undoubtedly come back and play it some more! Thanks for reading my wall of text.\n\ntl;dr- We aren't 10 anymore, scaring within the same universe doesn't work like it did on our younger selves, combat actually makes more sense than people give it credit for, wtf companion AI.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinder87/recommended/21690/","sinder87","Salmon Lord of Sinder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinder87/","539 products in account","A slightly souless successor to the epic Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 5 stumbles around trying to recreate what was loved about Resident Evil 4, either by adapting from certain elements or completely copying the exact same events.\n\nThing is that it sort of works. You have the same combat as Res 4, same sort of atmosphere and style, it's all in there and works in the gameplay's favour. However Resident Evil 5's major flaw is that it seriously lacks the charm and personality Resident Evil 4 flourished in. In story, Resident Evil 4 comes across as a B-movie with a sense of self-awarness that the Resident Evil series should pretty much just always have considering how blatently stupid the writing is (although funny as hell). Resident Evil 5 once again starts trying to take itself seriously in it's story and enviroment which doesn't really help since the story this time around has lost any of the mystery elements that kept Resident Evil 4's balance of action and horror and is now more action oriented when now it's more about straight up saving the world from ultra bad guy man person.\n\nResident Evil 4 had it's set pieces moving at a very good rate. Soon enough while in the Village it becomes night, as new terrors emerge from the darkness, or the island and how  you delve deeper into gruesome and sickening labratories  and of course there is the Castle to which any absurd thing can be just slammed right in there at any moment. It's designed in such a way that anything could be in the next room.\n\nResident Evil 5 doesn't really have anything new or continiously varied to it, and with the atmosphere now being kind of dead, there isn't too much to be remembered. The game for the most part repeats the same set pieces (Village, mines, labs) without adding to much to the mix or having the same twists and turns each place could have. There is really nothing in this game that could take you by suprise.\n\nIs the game fun? I guess it depends from how much you can get out of it. It's more arcadey this time around, more bent on action than survival and atmosphere, plus a new co-op feature which at the most is "neat and occasionally enjoyable" while also being "a completely destructing element". Cooping with a buddy CAN be fun, sure all atmosphere of horror is now completely dead and burried at least 60 feet under concrete, but meh, it can work out as an action game. The partner AI however is so absurdly bad that it forces me to make a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke that questions whether or not the partner AI was symbolism of the mindless zombies of the past because you're AI partner clearly does not have a functioning ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mind.\n\nYou're AI partner can shoot the things. That's about it. It will shoot the things, and can do nothing else. Want to give your partner a weapon to help with shooting the things? She (your partner Sheva) will use her pistol unless either 1. She runs out of ammo for the pistol (although sometimes will literally go find pistol ammo to use over using her fully stocked shotgun) or 2. You take the pistol away from her forcing the AI to use the other weapons. It's actually really astounding.\n\nWell, what else is there? A new inventory system. The cache case system is now thrown out and replaced with a real time 9 slot inventory overlay. This benefits the online play and the balance of pacing but also makes room for some massively stupid moments considering that every single item can take up a single space, aside from treasures. Occasionally you have to do trade offs if you have a full inventory and you gotta keep constantly switching around items just to either get some ammo, or health, or what have you. Possibly the stupidest part of all the inventory system is that armor takes up a inventory space. Beyond making no logical sense in any known universe, it is also obviously ridiculously inconvenience.\n\n\nSo that's Resident Evil 5. It's not techincally bad, but it's hallow and forgettable. Mediocre overall. That, and Resident Evil 4 got it's HD re-release on pc so there is no reason to not buy that.","February 3, 2015","false","24.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

From what amounts to open world exploration, with the need to gather keys, and clues, to uncover more passages; to an outright liner level design, with no doubling-back, and actual individule stages. It's just very strange, more than anything! As well--though Resident Evil. . .3, or was it zero? handled partners well, in this version it removes all the tension and fear, because you're very alert AI companion is by your side virtually at all times, and in fact I just stopped looking for enemies myself because I knew my partner would see them before I often would.\n\nIt should be called. .something else; a different series, with different characters; because that's what it feels like. It could be successful if that's what it was, but what's here does not really feel like an actual Resident Evil game, and that's really the very worse thing about it!\n\nI don't know what the project leads were thinking, but perhaps they were actually turned into zombies during production. Especially the later levels feel, just not well thought out in basic ways. Like, there's these just knee-high walls preventing you from travelling across the path, and you simply can not cross them, even though any human--or zombie--could just step over those walls! It was really my greatest memory of the game, after the first level; just standing there, saying to my character: "Leon, please, just. . . just step over that wall. . .Leon, Leon, please. . . please. . .you're a super special-ops trained officer; you've travelled across the world, fighting monsters! Look, I can see the path on the other side of it; there's even a treasure chest there! Just. . just please step over this tiny wall!!!" . . . . .It's not even a  hard puzzle to get around them, it's just that no human would ever have trouble walking from one side of that room to the other; even if they had a broken leg!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/21690/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","So, I heard a lot of stories about this game and they weren't good ones. "It's not Resident Evil anymore" they said. "Resident Evil 4 is better than this" they said. "Every Resident Evil after the 4th iteration is bad" they said. And what can I say? They're not right. It's as simple as that.\n\nAs harsh as this truth may be, Resident Evil has shifted its focus from classic survival horror to a more action oriented gameplay experience. But this already happened after Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. The fixed camera angles are missing in favor of a 3rd person perspective, the classic zombies from the first three games are no more and the story of the Umbrella corporation ended long before the setting of Resident Evil 4. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that Resident Evil 5, just like it's predecessor, is more action oriented than the classic Resident Evil titles.\n\nIn fact, a lot of people liked Resident Evil 4, but the fifth iteration wasn't all that well received. And I am asking myself: why is that? To me, Resident Evil 5 has numerous changes that made it better than it's predecessor. The controls on PC are marvelous compared to Resident Evil 4, the graphics are more advanced, some animations are nicer, the mercenaries mode is better and it features some new enemies. But I also have to say that Resident Evil 5 plays a lot like Resident Evil 4.\n\nA lot of the animations are recycled or reused, especially those for the Majini (which are basically reskinned Ganados from Resident Evil 4), it is still not possible to move whilst shooting and it just feels like Resident Evil 4, the only real change being the setting in Africa (so you're fighting against black Ganados, kind of) and the partner-mechanic, allowing for co-op or a single player mode with benefits (or annoyances). Well, the UI's different, too. Especially the inventory. It's gotten pretty small actually, compared to the Resident Evil 4 inventory when maxed out. You got nine inventory slots in total which means that you can only afford to take 3 weapons with you at most, I recommend carrying 2 weapons for each character so that you can still fit in first aid spray/herbs and grenades - or a bullet proof vest.\n\nAlso, the merchant from Resident Evil 4 is gone, that iconic figure. You will be missed. Aside from that, the health bar system is different, too. Instead of featuring a segmented bar which can be increased by consuming yellow herbs in combination with green herbs and red herbs, you have a full bar with a set amount of health - rendering the yellow herb obsolete in the process, which is why it was removed.\n\nBut aside from all this... Resident Evil 5 plays like Resident Evil 4 - just a little bit more simplified and with better looks. The puzzles, the combat, movement, boss battles and most of the animations are still the same. And what can I say? I liked Resident Evil 4 for what it was. The PC port was a horrible mess but I liked it nontheless. And so, Resident Evil 5 is also a game I would call a "nice game". Not outstandingly great by any means. It's a 3rd person action shooting game in the Resident Evil universe.\n\nFans of the original games won't like Resident Evil 5 nor will they like Resident Evil 4 all that much. But if you don't give a damn about the "true Resident Evil experience" and just want to play a nice 3rd person shooter with mutants and zombies in it, featuring some of your favourite characters from the Resident Evil universe and a bit of interesting lore, I recommend this game to you. Is it worth the price? Maybe, maybe not. But if it's on sale, you should get it. Definitely.","December 16, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Includes a decent amount of options, however horrible controls. Movement feels sluggish at times in comparison to previous Resident Evil games; It is especially worse when playing with a controller, although it doesn't seem to get much better when using a mouse and keyboard.\n\nAside from the port: The gameplay keeps you on edge. Enemies can approach you from ANY and ALL directions. There are various bosses you will encounter, and you will have several different, although similiar ways of getting past them. It can often become very challenging - even repetitive. You focus far too much on shooting your way out of almost every level, rather than considering a more 'tactical' approach as you may do so in previous games.\n\nOne of the "better" things about Resident Evil 5 is the integration of CO-OP. I'll admit, it's a mess. Although players continue to suffer the many issues of multiplayer, it definitely seemed like a good idea from a player's standpoint - being able to play with friends can make the overall experience more enjoyable for some.\n\nMy final rating is a 6/10. Why do I recommend this game? Simply put, it is a game that you can waste a decent amount of time playing, even if you won't be missing out on much if you were to pass it up.","December 27, 2015","true","10.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Chris and Sheva are both strong, intelligent and competent, something braindead Leon and glorified damsel Ashley never will be. Infected Africa? Infinitely more interesting and aesthetically pleasing than the brown, bland smear that was Spain. The controls and gameplay are much more polished, fluid in their execution and despite the usual narm the series is known for, this plot is actually pretty damn interesting.\n\nIt may not be a traditional Resident Evil title by any means, but as a solid, influential action horror game? Resident Evil 5 delivers and then some, more so with the relatively recent removal of GWFL.","December 8, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It is almost as though half of this game was made awesome and fun and the other half was made boring and slow.  I just wish I could skip the boring and slow levels.  This game would be much more fun if they did not use very old game mechanics.  In today's gaming, no one wants to see an animation of picking up gun bullets for the 30th time in 5 mins, should get it by being near it ect.  Almost the combat feels sluggish in an attempt to make you feel powerless, they could have counterd this with a built in hand to hand combat system alike "Condemed Criminal Origins".  I enjoyed the coop very much but struggle with playing single player due to the feeling as though I was driving a tank instead of an agile man.","February 19, 2011","true","1.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

They're still amazing for me (more than RE6)\n- Finally removed that anoying thing called "Games For Windows Live"\n- Gold Edition finally on PC!!!!\n- Upgrade your weapons, choose which weapon use in every mission.\n- Many variety of enemies / mutations (some really deadly)\n- Coop mode (i recomend that cause the AI is really bad / stupid in HIGH difficulties)\n- Mercenaries Mode / No Mercy\n- WESKER!!!\n\nThe Bad:\n- Short story compared with RE4 or the old RE games (posible to finish in 2 hours "playing seriously")\n- The AI is ridiculous. Sorry CAPCOM, but i never saw so bad AI on my whole life\n- Enemy programation is not the best. They are not HARD to defeat....they are ANOYING and sometimes the actions they make are quite strange or not logic\n- WESKER DIE T_T (spoiler)\n\nRecomeded!

I can't put my finger on it, but something is very wrong with this whole game. Maybe the atmosphere, or the fact that there's too much action in it for a Resident Evil game.\n\nThe story of the game is actually a milestone in the series, but it lacks the epicness and the presentation is poor.  I mean come on, you can't be serious to kill Albert Wesker without Jill being a part in the actual fight, or any other main character whatsoever. Having a random new character doing half of the job... I'd rather take more cliche.\nWith this game Resident Evil offically turned into a guilty pleasure franchise of mine, but I still can't like this game. It has lost the spirit, and except the final boss there isn't anything memorable really, it's a big shame.","February 15","false","17.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I was at the very least disappointed with most of this game.  The partner is shoe-horned in and her AI is broken.  Survival horror gives way to frustration when you realize that Sheva's stupid AI is what's getting you killed 9 out of 10 times.  If you can play co-op it might be enjoyable, but isn't this franchise supposed to give you a sense of lonely dread?  Co-op would destroy that feeling entirely.  Also, the 9-slot inventory similar to the original games seems like a step backward from the attaché case of RE4.  Throw in the racist bits in the swamp and this game can go ♥♥♥♥ itself.\n\nThere are some nice build up bits in the beginning similar to the village from RE4, but where that game took it's time before going nuts, this game just throws you into a bunch of plagas infected villagers the first chance it gets.  Even the guns feel less responsive.  Everything is just a step backwards from the masterpiece of RE4.  I bought this game since I own all the franchise and I wanted the collection to be complete, but I never thought when purchasing that I could hate a Resident Evil game this much.  I think I actually prefer 6 to this.\n2/10","October 10, 2015","false","3.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

What the hell, Capcom.\n\nThis version's .exe still redirects to GFWL's servers, so you're going to have to install all that crap again. Afterwards, an unsightly launcher will still be present on your desktop, displaying errors, but its okay, because the game will boot up. But prior to this, I had to drop a .dll file into my install directory or the GFWL installation would crap out? What even? They've also gutted DX10 support in this one and apparently Versus mode or split screen co-op is also borked?\n\nAdd to the fact that the game still costs $20 vanilla, or $30 with DLC, 5+ years after release. I paid ~$2 CDN in a bundle for this so whatever, plus the game underneath is still pretty decent.\n\nIt's like a way, way less charming and way, way less tightly refined version of RE4. Instead of Ashley being unobtrusive and super annoying, you have sassy not-Ada being a mule for your gear. Instead of Leon's glorious bishie sparkles, you have Chris punching boulders. Instead of being in not-Spain, you're in some place called Kijiji fighting the Ebola Corporation or whatever.\n\nSteep sale only or get it on PS3/360 instead.","October 13, 2015","false","1.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This is where the series became a third person action shooter (oh and now the monsters also shoots you back with firearms, in case it wasn't an action shooter enough)...\nCharacters are absolutely the worst:\n- how they transformed Chris (in the end he also SMASH a giant volcano rock with his fists)\n- how they transformed Jill\n- how the whole Wesker thing ends... really irrespectful of how big of an antagonist he was\n- Sheva, the big booby woman I can't even remember the name of and the others...\n\nYou want to play this with a friend so you can just have fun regardless of what game are you playing? (they could have called this game African Crazy Shooter 5 and none would have found similitaries to Resident Evil)\nBuy it then and have fun, you're going to share a few laughs with your buddies.\n\nBUT if...\nYou want to play this game because you loved Resident Evil and just want more of its story and survival gameplay?\nSTAY AWAY FOR YOUR OWN SAKE... this game takes the WORST part of Resident Evil 4, get it even worse and make a whole game out of it.","August 13, 2015","false","44.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/upsilonforce/recommended/21690/","upsilonforce","Knight(300ping is love/life)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/upsilonforce/","128 products in account","Resident Evil/Biohazard has been a beloved zombie shooter for many years now. However, despite the praise of its atmosphere and gameplay, the game was regularly criticized for its clunky movement controls and unintuitive U.I. Resident Evil needed to evolve and rework these dated issues if it wanted to survive its own longetivity. In 2005, RE4 hit the market with overwhelming positive reviews. It pioneered the over the shoulder view of shooters, delivering superb gameplay, action, and smooth UI/controls. The community's only issue was they wanted to play the thriller with a friend. Capcom heard the plight and RE5 was announced. We were all ready to pounce on the idea that we could finally RE in co-op....however, we learned the hard way that we might have jumped the shark, as well as received another punishing lesson on "Why we don't pre-order games."\n\nPlot 4/10\n\nIn typical RE fasion, the story is bumpy, confusing, littered with holes, and told from the perspective of a 10 yr old that was along for the ride. It's everything you've seen before: the (insert random letter)-virus has broken out this time because - dammit we're not out of letters in the English alphabet yet - and it's turning people into...zombies. Capcom has left their mark on abysmal story telling once more, giving you - once AGAIN - JUST enough of an excuse to slaughter everything in your path from point A to point B, taking brief intermissions to hunt down keys (at least it doesn't happen in a castle this time). So, the formula is: country/location + random letter in the English alphabet + "virus" = RE story. Most of the cast sound like they said their lines on the first take with no director telling them "sound more like this". Every character is one-dimensional with dialogue that is even worse. "What is this place? Where is Jill? What the hell is that?! We need a key." is the plot in a nutshell. Hell, THE WIKI tells the story better than this game does! It's pathetic. I gave it a 4 because Chris does have ONE moment of personality that made his character acceptable.\n\nSound 5/10\n\nThe sounds are all great! Guns, groans, motors, stone slabs moving around, splashing water, and even "some" of the actors are impressive! (I was most impressed with Jill's voice. She was terrific! Wesker is passible too.) The low score comes from the rest of the cast. Their lines are delivered with all the excitement and enthusiasm of a business math teacher. Combine this with the terrible plot/dialogue, you will be skipping every cutscene with no regrets. Capcom's only desparate attempt to keep the player interested in the cutscenes is showing a chick half-nude. "Hi, I'm (name) and my purpose in this plot is.....is um.....it's....uh I don't have one....um BOOBIES!" Does Capcom hate women or what?\n\nThe music is awesome! Some of the scores are on par with John Williams' compositions!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsKZCiylJPw&list=PL0DB42B60626735D6&index=17\n\nGraphics 7/10\n\nI think they're beautiful, but almost everyone disagrees with me. My only gripe with the graphics is the enviornments are so bland; brown/tan washouts with no memorable scenery. They look great, but are just uninteresting.\n\nGameplay 8/10\n\nWho cares about all that stuff anyway? It's a game, right? So, how's the game play? It works rather well! The controls are almost identical to RE4, which is fine and all, but nothing noteworthy or "all that new" was added aside from minor things. The game plays like RE4.5 instead of RE5. You use the same guns, fight the same guys, use the same controls, but this time, we tossed in Africa to the above mentioned formula. One new thing I loved was the ability to combo each other's melee attacks; tossing an enemy back and forth to your teammate, or getting behind a stunned enemy to kill it instantly. You can upgrade your guns and there's a few new toys like the shock stick that are kinda fun (but very under powered). Another feature is the new inventory and how it allows you to switch weapons on the fly or trade with your teammate. Although co-op, the game never takes advantage of the idea of having 2 players. The only time you "cooperate" is: I stand here 'n kill stuff, you go ober dere 'n kill stuff. I also hate the QTE's. They never give you enough of a warning, and usually are just a free death. It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it feels cheap and hurts the fun factor. In the end, RE5 is fun, and co-op will sate, but you can't shake that feeling that it's half-hearted. (RE5 got a lot of flak for its slow moving characters and sluggish turning. I personally think it's wonderful, and RE should have kept this. When they added free movement of other third-person games, the series went straight to CoD/GoW. I blame most of RE6's failure on this alone. Controls take some getting used to, but you'll learn to embrace it.)\n\nSide notes: I wanted to save extra room to address the game's most controversial topic: racism. The short answer: ludacris. A virus breaks out all over the world in different games, but when it lands in Africia, NOW its racist? So, I can shoot zombies, but if I see a black zombie, now it's unethical. It doesn't make sense. "Racism" is very poorly defined nowadays, and everyone's just jumping in the bandwagon of ERMAHGERD RATHITH everytime a black person is even involved in said topic. Capcom even apologized to the world saying "we learned our lesson: no more racism!" As soon as I heard that, I knew 1 of 2 things were going to happen: either the next RE would happen in Asia (because Capcom is Japanese. It's politically safe.) or we would go back to Europe in RE4 where we killed 1,000s of hispanics, because obviously the community finds that more ethical. Sure enough, RE6 took place in Asia. Hire me. SHEVA'S DIALOGUE FLAT OUT SAYS WHY SHE EXISTS. Not because of character design, not to satisfy a plot hole in the story, but to ease the tensions of a white American killing black zombies...and a souless player-slot. I'm against racism and all, but this whole "racism" fad has derailed and spiraled out of control. Look at this this way for a second: we say this game is racist because its a white male killing blacks. Well, what if it was a black male killing white female zombies? Would that be acceptable? Why or why not? How about attacking the game for a REAL issue of bigotry like it's portrayal of women? I think the boss fight against Jill deserves some criticism. Kill 1,000's of hispanic zombies in RE4, nobody bats an eye. Kill a few black zombies, and everyone loses their s*&%.\n\nA final thing I have to address is the "Gold Edition". Never heard of it? That's because it was a CONSOLE-ONLY RELEASE. After seeing some videos of GE's content, I found that it was had enough extra content to be a whole sequal in itself; as if Capcom deliberately witheld half of the game to release it later (not the first or last time they've done this. Check out Marvel vs. Capcom 3 then Ultimate MvC3). PC fans of RE5 were left in the dust. A nice, big, middle-finger was shot to PC gamers which is another of Capcom's terrible blights on their reputation (google metacritic Chaos Legion).\n\nThe Verdict\n\nRE5 does deliver on fun gameplay, but coop is never taken to the height that it deserves. Unlockables do add noteworth replayability, but poor acting, poor story telling, bad plot, actors reluctant to do their jobs, and boring characters will ensure you don't stay for the story. RE5 scores a 7/10. It's a good game and worth buying, even for a solo play, but it's far from great; worth a run though.","September 23, 2014","true","80.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After my time with the game, I feel NO remorse recommending this game to all who read this. I want you to know that this game is not your typical "Resident Evil" game. It is filled with much more action ala RE4, but blasting your way through it will only get you so far. I'd recommend keeping your space is dangerous situations. Most go overboard reluctantly with the action and it usually dampers the experience.\nAfter a wonderful experience in summer playing through this game with my brother, I feel totally satisfied with the game and the Mercenaries mode makes a return, and adds a LOT of last-ability if you want to hone your skills, not to mention the online is great. This is a solid game and I suggest you get it if you think you want it, and, ESPECIALLY, is you have a friend. Having one to play, or using anonymous online lets you bypass a lot of AI issues. (plus, there's a lot of mods!).\n\nTlDr; Stunning game, I love it, play with a friend or use anon online, and get it if you think you should.\n(Also, don't let my game time fool you, I played a LOT of the 360 ver)","November 30, 2013","true","60.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

DECISIONS!\n\nAnd there's the ONE BIG FLAW of this game: lack of manual save...\nAnyway, you can always load a saved game to collect more ammo/gold since they respawn EVERY time you just reload an autosaved game (NOTE!: the game only saves on auto, you can't manually save, AND the checkpoints DON'T reload if you quit the game; keep that in mind to avoid frustration, unless you're a noob, you should know by now that A CHECKPOINT ISN'T ALWAYS AN AUTOSAVE FILE)\nANOTHER TIP: every time you quit, the game will ASK you if you wanna SAVE THE INVENTORY-> keep in mind that CHOOSING YES will save your current ammo/gold, and that CAN be a problem: for example, I reloaded a saved game with tons of ammo, but a boss kicked my ♥♥♥; tired of dying-reloading-dying-reloading-dying-etc, I called t quits for the day, then I chose "yes-save the inventory" option without realizing what the hell  I was doing (I was sleepy), and the result was that the game saved my inventory with almost NO BULLETS left; I nearly had a seizure...for real; in other words, YOU SHOULD ONLY SAVE YOUR INVENTORY AFTER ADVANCING A CHAPTER OR AFTER DEFEATING A BOSS, BUT NEVER AFTER GETTING KILLED...\n\nIgnore the bitter hipster haters that still think this franchise should have ended after RE3, the RE franchise is alive and well (check out my review of RE6, that game didn't suck at all...)\n\nPD: you'll find a lot of noobs crying here because the game cannot work without GFWL; well, it's not that difficult to just SHUT DOWN the damn thing, bunch of noobs...","September 16, 2014","true","23.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So, I have been avoiding it for a while and now I finally gave it a chance and well, guess what, I think this game is definitely one of the best games I have ever played. Good story is there, I like the fact that there is a partner that follows you. But unfortunately, I think there are some issues with the control. It can be hard to change weapons or use items as you can not just pause the game and do what you need to do without getting attacked. Yes, changing weapons and using items and such all happen in real time, so you better get used to it. And sometimes the AI of the partner can be dumb and annoying, and I really don't think all the weapon change and item use should be this inconvenient. But despite the fact that there are some visible flaws, with awkward control, actually that kind of adds fear onto the player even more, and I would say that is a good thing.

DECISIONS!\n\nAnd there's the ONE BIG FLAW of this game: lack of manual save...\nAnyway, you can always load a saved game to collect more ammo/gold since they respawn EVERY time you just reload an autosaved game (NOTE!: the game only saves on auto, you can't manually save, AND the checkpoints DON'T reload if you quit the game; keep that in mind to avoid frustration, unless you're a noob, you should know by now that A CHECKPOINT ISN'T ALWAYS AN AUTOSAVE FILE)\nANOTHER TIP: every time you quit, the game will ASK you if you wanna SAVE THE INVENTORY-> keep in mind that CHOOSING YES will save your current ammo/gold, and that CAN be a problem: for example, I reloaded a saved game with tons of ammo, but a boss kicked my ♥♥♥; tired of dying-reloading-dying-reloading-dying-etc, I called t quits for the day, then I chose "yes-save the inventory" option without realizing what the hell  I was doing (I was sleepy), and the result was that the game saved my inventory with almost NO BULLETS left; I nearly had a seizure...for real; in other words, YOU SHOULD ONLY SAVE YOUR INVENTORY AFTER ADVANCING A CHAPTER OR AFTER DEFEATING A BOSS, BUT NEVER AFTER GETTING KILLED...\n\nIgnore the bitter hipster haters that still think this franchise should have ended after RE3, the RE franchise is alive and well (check out my review of RE6, that game didn't suck at all...)\n\nPD: you'll find a lot of noobs crying here because the game cannot work without GFWL; well, it's not that difficult to just SHUT DOWN the damn thing, bunch of noobs...","September 16, 2014","true","23.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'd have to agree with both, since the controls are not perfect for keyboard, tricky on a controler and defenetly awkward in general. They are easy to get used to, however.\nStory wise, this game is amazing. I've loved the story so far and i've had a lot of fun as well. Its not as fun, alone as it is with a friend, for the obvious "Trying to ♥♥♥♥ each other up" moments where you shoot an explosive barrel just to damage him a little. It has its fun moments, and co-op is always apreciated. Alone, the game gets a bit scary as it should (not enough as it should be for a horror survival game). With a friend, its fun, its good and i enjoyed it.\nI'm a huge resident evil fan, from 0 to 6 (i've played 0,1,2,dark side chronicles, 5 and 6. I'm trying to get resident evil 4 as its one of the best in the series. So you can see im quite a huge fan).\nSo, in conclusion, the quality is decent, the story is good, the bosses are interesting, the final boss is also pretty cool, the co-op is fun, and even alone its decent.\n\nOverall i'd give this game a 7/10\nImportant notes:\n-Worth your time if you are a resident evil fan that does play for the story and not just for the gameplay.\n-If you don't play for the story, not worth buying.\n-Bonus mission with an easter egg that allows you to play with the original camera from the first games, during that whole mission. So if you enjoyed the first games like i did, you will find this part pretty cool as well.","September 17, 2014","true","48.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is similar although I prefer RE4's inventory system - it is more simplified in RE5, also the game does not pause when you bring it up to switch items which can lead to frustration during hectic gameplay.\n\nGraphically the game is excellent and it still looks very good even for 2015 imo.  It also runs very smoothly and is a high quality port.  Music and voice acting are also excellent.\n\nThe main campaign is a lot shorter than RE4's, my fastest playthrough was 3hrs 9mins (on a successive playthrough with upgraded weapons etc.).  If you play normally and don't rush it might take you about twice that long.  There is plenty of incentive to play through the campaign multiple times, to get all the Steam achievements, find all the treasure, buy and upgrade all the weapons and get enough points to unlock all the bonus unlockable items, figurines, additional characters etc.\n\nThe game has a great atmosphere, the action is very satisfying and the characters are likeable and you enjoy their company.  On the negative side, your partner's AI is poor at times and they often get themselves killed (because they don't defend themselves for example), don't heal you quickly enough so you die, or walk in front of you while you are trying to shoot.  On the higher difficulty levels this can be infuriating.  I have completed the game on Professional difficulty which was EXTREMELY frustrating at times - but it can be done.\n\nThe DLC is short but good fun (especially Lost in Nightmares) as is the additional Mercenaries mode with new characters.\n\nNow that the game has Steam cloud support and has ditched the hated GFWL I highly recommend it.","April 25, 2015","true","79.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lo consideran una aberración a la saga y (por lo que yo se) lo consideran el peor resident evil después del 6. En mi opininión diré que esta gente esta equivocada.\n\nEl juego no es una obra de arte, no es survival horror, no tiene sustos y tampoco tiene tantas armas y/o enemigos como otros resident evil. Esto significa que este sea un mal juego? En absoluto.\n\nEl juego cuenta con unas mecanicas bastante buenas y los controles son probablemente de los mejores en resident evil. Combinaciones de golpes y diseño del inventario, los denominaría como inmejorables.\nComo dicen la mayoria de reseñas de este juego consideran a Sheva como un estorbo. A mi me parecio bastante util. Ayuda cuando tiene que hacerlo y te salva la vida muchas veces.\n\nHay que decir que el juego tiene pocas armas y esto le resta puntuación, pero los distintos enemigos son bastante buenos. Hay un poco de todo. Es decir, hay enemigos que solo les veras un par de veces en todo el juego.\n\nEl juego es largo, divetido de jugar y aunque la trama no sea un bombazo, yo creo que se pueden pasar unas saludales 20h jugandolo.

Imagine narrow corridors disguised as alleys, narrow corridors disguised as hallways, narrow corridors disguised as sewers, narrow corridors disguised as pathways between containers and you get the idea.  Eventually we will get to narrow corridors disguised as narrow corridors.\nAt heart most games are basically linear in concept, but this one is so obviously confined to just one narrow path that it's sucks the fun out of the game and what is more, there is virtual no story, no atmosphere , no interesting characters and no interesting dialogue to keep you going.\nThe gameplay itself contributes to this monotonous tedium. You spent half the time scavenging for ammo which you find in small portions but need in large amounts because all the adversaries take multiple hits in the head alone.. shooting other area's of the body just make them blink or fall down for a moment, if you are lucky. And the game throws lots of them at you.\nCombat itself is an awkward affair. Nothing seems to work quite right. It is almost comical how the ai works.. with enemies lumbering towards you and staring past you while making threatening movements away from you. Combat is sluggish.\nPersonally I couldn't fathom why you would want to play this game when there are some many better ones out there.\nIf you like a game with a good story, captivating atmosphere and interesting characters, try Resident Evil Revelations 2.\nIf, on the other hand, you like shooters, look elsewhere as well. Give Spec Ops: The Line a try.  The combat is a lot better.\nIf you like a tedious monotonous linear game that you only play because you are a RE fan and you  are charmed by the hot side kick Sheva then buy RE 5.  But only when it's on sale.. for paying more than a few bucks for being bored is a waste of your money and your life.\nAnyway.. if you still want to give RE 5 a try I hope you have fun.","May 23, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A game that to this date seems to suffer from the love-it-or-hate-it syndrome.\nToo bad for it, RE5 was a follow up to Capcom's most excellent (and to this day one of the best games ever made) Resident Evil 4. Let's start with a simple question: Is it as good as RE4? Hell no. But that poses another, possibly more important inquiry: Is it a good game? Hell yes.\n\nRE5 on its own is a solid, pretty (despite the gray-ish color palette) and fun experience. For its age it still holds up surprisingly well, it runs at constant 60fps even during cutscenes (which sometimes seems not to be intended causing some graphical issues) and its replay value is actually quite high. Even more so than RE4's.\nAs far as gameplay goes it's more of the same if you played RE4. Run around, aim, shoot, explore, hit some bad guys, solve some incredibly simple puzzles (except for one particular one that actually makes you think a little bit), break boxes with your knife, get hit by a snake and run some more. Oh, and the ocassional boss fight here and there. It even adds up to the already solid gameplay with more contect-sensitive actions, like melee strings with your partner (Oh yeah, this game has an active partner) which can be very useful.\nIts main attractive of course is co-op, which drastically improves both the experience and replay value. Online co-op works well but as always playing with people you know is the best choice, as items, ammo and weapons are shared and that can get a bit complex when playing with randoms.\nSpeaking of weapons and replay value, another great point for the game is its upgrading system. After you -or your partner- get a weapon you can buy it from the store, so no worries if  you missed it. Upgrading your weapons is a very effective tool to survive longer, though it costs money. You can then use those weapons on previous episodes and make your life easier, or your partner's if you are playing with a newcomer or wanna get stuff you missed. Let me tell you, replaying the first chapter is a whole different experience with an upgraded arsenal and some serious firepower.\n\nOverall this game benefits greatly from co-op and I'd dare say it makes it an actually unique experience, at least for its time. If you're one of those who skipped it because it wasn't RE4-2 or forced the co-op on you, give it a chance, I know I did and I don't regret it.","October 17, 2015","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It also runs very smoothly and is a high quality port.  Music and voice acting are also excellent.\n\nThe main campaign is a lot shorter than RE4's, my fastest playthrough was 3hrs 9mins (on a successive playthrough with upgraded weapons etc.).  If you play normally and don't rush it might take you about twice that long.  There is plenty of incentive to play through the campaign multiple times, to get all the Steam achievements, find all the treasure, buy and upgrade all the weapons and get enough points to unlock all the bonus unlockable items, figurines, additional characters etc.\n\nThe game has a great atmosphere, the action is very satisfying and the characters are likeable and you enjoy their company.  On the negative side, your partner's AI is poor at times and they often get themselves killed (because they don't defend themselves for example), don't heal you quickly enough so you die, or walk in front of you while you are trying to shoot.  On the higher difficulty levels this can be infuriating.  I have completed the game on Professional difficulty which was EXTREMELY frustrating at times - but it can be done.\n\nThe DLC is short but good fun (especially Lost in Nightmares) as is the additional Mercenaries mode with new characters.\n\nNow that the game has Steam cloud support and has ditched the hated GFWL I highly recommend it.","April 25, 2015","true","79.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story sets of with Chris Redfield and his new partner Sheva Alomar trying to stop biological weapons spreading in Africa. The story has a big twist from Chapter 4 and on. It becomes totally different which is a very welcoming thing. Resident Evil 5's graphics are simply stunning for a game that came out in 2009. Character models are great and so is the sound + voice acting. There is extreme fun to be had in Resident Evil 5 alone or with a friend/relative. This is definitely the best 3RD person "Survival Horror" game I've ever played.\nGraphics: 10/10\nStory: 9.5/10\nSound : 9.5/10\nMultiplayer/Co-op: 10/10\nOverall: 9.7/10\nResident Evil 5 is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all times. Not does it only do all thing's correct but it expands survival horror in a new genre of co-op fun.\nI finished this game 11 times and counting. It never gets old and there is a MASSIVE replay ability to be found.

Lo consideran una aberración a la saga y (por lo que yo se) lo consideran el peor resident evil después del 6. En mi opininión diré que esta gente esta equivocada.\n\nEl juego no es una obra de arte, no es survival horror, no tiene sustos y tampoco tiene tantas armas y/o enemigos como otros resident evil. Esto significa que este sea un mal juego? En absoluto.\n\nEl juego cuenta con unas mecanicas bastante buenas y los controles son probablemente de los mejores en resident evil. Combinaciones de golpes y diseño del inventario, los denominaría como inmejorables.\nComo dicen la mayoria de reseñas de este juego consideran a Sheva como un estorbo. A mi me parecio bastante util. Ayuda cuando tiene que hacerlo y te salva la vida muchas veces.\n\nHay que decir que el juego tiene pocas armas y esto le resta puntuación, pero los distintos enemigos son bastante buenos. Hay un poco de todo. Es decir, hay enemigos que solo les veras un par de veces en todo el juego.\n\nEl juego es largo, divetido de jugar y aunque la trama no sea un bombazo, yo creo que se pueden pasar unas saludales 20h jugandolo.

Imagine narrow corridors disguised as alleys, narrow corridors disguised as hallways, narrow corridors disguised as sewers, narrow corridors disguised as pathways between containers and you get the idea.  Eventually we will get to narrow corridors disguised as narrow corridors.\nAt heart most games are basically linear in concept, but this one is so obviously confined to just one narrow path that it's sucks the fun out of the game and what is more, there is virtual no story, no atmosphere , no interesting characters and no interesting dialogue to keep you going.\nThe gameplay itself contributes to this monotonous tedium. You spent half the time scavenging for ammo which you find in small portions but need in large amounts because all the adversaries take multiple hits in the head alone.. shooting other area's of the body just make them blink or fall down for a moment, if you are lucky. And the game throws lots of them at you.\nCombat itself is an awkward affair. Nothing seems to work quite right. It is almost comical how the ai works.. with enemies lumbering towards you and staring past you while making threatening movements away from you. Combat is sluggish.\nPersonally I couldn't fathom why you would want to play this game when there are some many better ones out there.\nIf you like a game with a good story, captivating atmosphere and interesting characters, try Resident Evil Revelations 2.\nIf, on the other hand, you like shooters, look elsewhere as well. Give Spec Ops: The Line a try.  The combat is a lot better.\nIf you like a tedious monotonous linear game that you only play because you are a RE fan and you  are charmed by the hot side kick Sheva then buy RE 5.  But only when it's on sale.. for paying more than a few bucks for being bored is a waste of your money and your life.\nAnyway.. if you still want to give RE 5 a try I hope you have fun.","May 23, 2015","false","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I mean the coop does not stand in  your way. The coop kills enemies like you, sometimes successfully and sometimes not.\n\n- Unlimited and configurable framerate. Smooth gameplay is possible.\n\n- Many opportunities to act tactically: Before beginning new levels, the player can buy weapons, add them to the inventory or equip the character\n\n- You can skip many cutscenes, no need to wait.\n\n- Challenging gameplay\n\n- Nice, realistic animations of the enemies. Different target zones of the enemies. Vulnerable and protected parts of the animated characters.\n\n\nTHE BAD THINGS:\n\n- No decent physics effects\n\nI like action games with decent physics effects. Unfortunately there's almost no physics and no ragdoll effects.\n\n- Annoying dialogues\n\nThe most annoying thing is the conversation part between the two characters. For example:\nIf your partner helps you (shiva) she always asks "are you okay?" or "you have to be careful"\nYou have to be careful - how silly is this???\nIt would have been better if there had been an option to turn this off.\n\n- Some bad animations and items\n\nIf you kill a zombie he does not fall to the ground and bleed.\nNo. Insted he falls to the ground and - after a few seconds - some bubbles occur and the corpse vanishes.\nI thought this would be a game for people over 18 and that it would contain some action and violence - I was wrong.\n\nIf you kill an enemy the corpse vanishes and either there occurs some gold coins, ammonition or a plant.\nA plant???? Yes a plant!!! You use plants to heal you or your partner.\nBut when you pick up the plant - it occurs as a laboratory test tube in your inventory.\nAnd if you use this tube you handle it as a spray. The animation is like you use a hair spray.\nTHIS is not logical. It's ridiculous.\n\nAnother silly animation: If your partner helps you, he or she stabs some kind of needle into your stomach. The player has protective clothes but it is possible to apply some kind of syringe. hm...\n\nIf you shoot an enemy in the head and don't get a clear headshot, the enemy pivots the head. This seems to be scriped animation. In the 90s it was ok to show such animations - but today these predictable animations have been replaced by good physics. Not in this game ;-(\nOk there is also some physics - for example the impact of explosive things like grenades.\nAnd on the other hand it is a challenge to aim at the.... *g*\n\n\n\n\n\nSome info (not bad critics, but info)\n\nParticularities of the GAME CONTROLS:\n\nThe first things that I noticed when I started playing were the controls. Or better: The realisation of the way you can move your character. It's not comparable with the controls in common ego shooter. For a 3rd person shooter it's ok.\n\nI can't look at a right angle to the ground or to the sky. Theres only a specific angle possible.\nI cant jump whenever I want. I only can jump if theres a possibilty.\nIf I walk I can strafe. But if I run I can't.\nIf the player does not walk he can turn quickly by moving the mouse.\nBut if he moves he only can turn the character slowly.\n\nAiming:\nThe character can't aim steadily. Instead the crosshair swings slowly around the target.\nI assume they wanted to simulate real aiming, considering that a human can't keep the hands still while breathing.\nNice idea, why not ;-) So it's more important to pull the trigger in the right moment when shooting.","March 30","true","34.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The creepy atmospheric terror of the past games is gone, but there is a different kind of violent apprehension present in this game which gives you the feeling that you definitely want to avoid dying if you can help it. Aint nobody want whatever the hell that monster is up in your junk!\n\nI first played Resident Evil 5 many years ago now in a friend's house, sitting next to him on local co-op and the experience was fantastic. So it is a bit perturbing that the PC port has the local co-op stripped out, but online co-op seems to function fine.\n\nOverall, if you are after a convincing horror game then you may want to look elsewhere but if high quality action is your thing then buying this is never going to be a bad choice.

The AI partner isn't very bright so you might want to play it coop.\n\nThen you get to the second half of the game when the zombies have guns and the game forces you to use poorly implemented cover shooting mechanics and everything goes downhill. The game becomes really not fun to play and a lot of the bosses are really poorly designed. At least half of them don't make it clear what you have to do, or if what you are doing is having any effect.\n\nThe mercenary mode you unlock by finishing the campaign is fantastic and really fun though and is pretty much the only reason I give this game a recommendation.\n\nOh yeah, the game uses GFWL for co-op. Not only that service is garbage but it will be taken down in July 2014. So on second though, don't buy this.

Solid gameplay, good replayability (I've probably been through it 10+ times), and the coop mode is awesome.  In addition, the storyline in this game tries to tie things in from previous games and I think it's actually quite good and interesting for a Resident Evil game.","December 20, 2013","true","26.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Been a fan of the Resident Evil/Biohazard series since the 90s. It sticks to its survival horror roots but offers some good intense shooter elements in the mix. Highly recommend this game whether you're a fan or not.","March 29, 2015","true","22.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But a few days ago i bought it on steam when it eas on offer to play co op. But to play online you nheed to make a live account which seemed stupad as every other game i played on steam i could play online through steam, but i did it anyway as i liked the game. so when i finaly get in the game it signs me out of live every few minutes for no reason and doesnt let you save any games.  This game is by far the single worst thing i ever bought on steam and the biggest waste of time. I urge everyone to never ever buy this game on here.

Do you wish to sign in to xbox live in order to play co-op on pc? I sure as hell don't and if you don't want that either, don't buy this game. My friend kept ♥♥♥♥♥ing kicked from the game, forcing me to reinvite and restart. Xbox-style loading screens permeated every inch of the game, and the in-game chat was terrible. This port isn't even worth the $6.80 I payed for it.","March 5, 2015","false","1.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","1"
