"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/17470/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Dead Space is pretty cool, I guess.\n\nSet in the distant future of 2002, you play as Isaac Clarke, a man with two dads: Isaac Newton and Arthur Clarke. Unlike many Sci-Fi protagonists, Isaac is a space Engineer, which is like a normal Engineer but in space. And if EA promotional content is anything to go by, Isaac is also a golfer, a skateboarder, a mercenary, a world famous pugilist, and probably a really good kisser.\n\nOne day, Isaac and friends go to fix a bunch of broken stuff aboard the USG Ishimura, a ship that's literally named "Rock Village". Unfortunately it does the opposite of make villages out of rocks and instead cracks planets open to eat the sweet sweet planet juice hiding inside. Ooh baby.  Unfortunately, someone opened the space zombie can and now there are space zombies everywhere.\n\nOn the bright side, even though Isaac majored in engineering, he also apparently minored in being a unkillable death god from the 4th dimension because Isaac's right hook hits with about enough force to send the moon out of orbit and crashing into the planet below. When this game was still coming out back in 2008, the developers boasted that Isaac was at a disadvantage because he was an engineer and not a space marine. But Isaac still opens up more cans of Whoop A than the entire Earth military combined. It must be all that pent up space sexual frustration. Because he's in space.\n\nThe most unique aspect is that, outside of maybe one or two weapons, Isaac remains in his field of expertise in terms of equipment. But then again, his first weapon is called a plasma cutter. As in a tool that cuts things with plasma. Why don't you just give him a asteroid chainsaw while you're at it?\nActually, do that, that would be awesome.\n\nBut outside of developer words, Isaac is a huge faker. Sure he screams at everything and runs like a girl. But at the same time the guy can quick draw and open fire like the best of them.  But lets stop talking about that hunk of murder for a moment and talk about the Ishimura itself.\n\nThe Ishimura is the largest and oldest ship of it's class. Roughly 1.6 Km in length if the wiki is to be believed. When you're inside it's dark, dingy, Event Horizon inspired interior, you can actually kind of believe that people lived in there. Outside of the workbench and the machine that sells you murder tools for money. There are constant reminders that the Ishimura at one point, had it's own ecosystem and community. The ship seems to have everything from accommodations, recreational areas, movie theaters, video games, posters of products, vending machines, and even a restaurant. My favorite was the Zero-G basketball. Get dunked on, son.\n\nThe Necromorphs, Daughter Space's antagonists, are gross little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Originally the inhabitants of the USG Stonetown, the necromorphs now hunt through the halls, killing anything that doesn't look like them as well as spreading this weird mossy flesh stuff that looks like the stuff I find on my toilet seat.\n\nBut now that everyone is dead, outside of a few induviduals, as well as all of the angry space zombies onboard, is the Ishimura scary? Well, outside of the atmoshpere, no, not really. If anything the game is like a reverse horror story about alien lifeforms doing their best to try and stop an angry man covered in metal bits, jacked up on blue milk and packing more heat than the Detroit police department.\n\nIs Dad Space a good horror game? No. Is it fun? Yes, I would say so. The weapons are crunchy and fun to use, the enemies have enough variety to make you switch up your strategies, and there's enough bread crumbs and rewards for exploration to get you into finding audio logs and picking up space money to buy space stuff.\n\nI'm not saying that Dude Space would be scarier if Isaac was defenseless. I happen to not enjoy horror games where you run away a bunch very fun because I'm already very good at running away from my problems. I'm just saying that maybe they should have turned it down a bit, maybe even gave Isaac less equipment but more evasion options, such as hiding or sweet slide tackles. Not even half way through the game I had to start putting health items away because my aim is as perfect as I am handsome and I was losing space for ammo in favor of the blue milk boxes.\n\nBut should you play Father Area?\nIt's a fun game, just not a scary one. I did not find myself pooping my pants or screaming really loudly for YouTube money. But I did find an appeal in going from room to room exterminating the space Vampires. It's almost like a natural selection thing.\nMan eat planet.\nSpace zombies eat man.\nImmortal war god eat space zombie.\n\nDeDe Laboratory is on the cheap, and usually goes down in price during sales. Give the game a looksy, maybe it'll hook you in for the sequels, which I'm heading to next. It's definitely one of EA's better games, but that's probably not saying much considering the crimes they commit on a regular basis.\n\nDed Sposs gets 8 irate space miners out of 10.\n\nAlso, apparently the game had really gory death scenes but I didn't get any of those because I'm objectively the best.\n\nJust the best.\n\nThe best Curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience","October 31, 2015","true","10.2"," 252 of 288 people (88%) found this review helpful 301 people found this review funny","88","252","288","301","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/17470/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Dead Space is the unofficial Alien game we always wanted! The horrific plight of starship engineer Issac Clark aboard the U.S.G Ishimura perfectly replicates the feeling of isolation and suspense of Ridley Scott's classic, while also innovating and branching out on its own right to create an impeccable homage to sci-fi horror which continually surprises and rewards with each astoundingly well thought out design decision.\n\nImmersion is everything to Dead Space. The complete lack of a standard HUD or in level load screens, inventory and menus screens that don't pause the game and the fact you are never taken away from Issac's perspective whether during gameplay or in menus, all combines to ensure you are never taken out of the experience. I have to commend the developer for what they have done with the HUD, placing standards like health and ammo counts not on a floating display but physically on the character and weapon at hand. It is one of the most original ideas I've seen in any game for years that takes something simple and makes it elegant, and taken as a whole this is one of the most atmospheric games ever released.\n\nGameplay is equally ingenious in that it takes something we know, in this case the shooting mechanics of a game like Resident Evil 4, and turns it on its head. Disregarding the tried-and-true "aim for the head" mantra, you are required to dismember the tentacle like arms and legs of your enemies piece by piece, chopping them up into limbless husks in a concise and diligent manner conserving as much ammo as you can in the process. It's as gruesome as it sounds, but more than just an all out gore fest it lends a more strategic and thoughtful approach to combat that asks you to hold still and be precise with your shots in the midst of extreme peril, which gives it a feel all its own and playing other games afterwards starkly outlines how traditional many of them are in comparison.\n\nOf course none of this impromptu surgery would be possible without one of the best weapons in video game history: the plasma cutter. A tool of Issac's trade, it shoots a beam razor sharp plasma perfect for severing the many appendages of your foes, and can be rotated for an even more exact cut. It's so good in fact that it actually forms one of my few complaints, as the other more rudimentary tools of destruction are far less interesting and practical to use, to the point I actively tried to avoid having to take them out. Thankfully after a few upgrades that became a very rare occasion, and the plasma cutter certainly is enough to make up for the lack of other useful weapons.\n\nDespite going on more than a half decade at the time of this review, this is still an exceptionally good looking game which stands testament to how impressive it was to begin with. The environments are vivid and cohesive without growing sterile, and the expert use of shadows is still unmatched by many more recent games. Reference quality sound design sells the experience, almost demanding a high quality sound system or pair of headphones to fully appreciate. The plot never intrigued me in any great amount, but like Bioshock before it much of the exposition is left in the form of audio diaries and notes which provided a great deal of backstory on the events before your arrival, and help compensate for the otherwise lackluster narrative that only barely covers the typical video game chicanery of sending you to every corner of the ship in a rather contrived manner.\n\nOne final note isn't so much a con as simply something that should be stated. Despite its horror trappings Dead Space is still an action game first and foremost. After the first hour or so enemy patterns and scare tactics become easy to spot and predict, which while not detracting from the experience may disappoint some hoping to be frightened out of their wits. That said it is still very apt at getting your pulse up through the ever constant gloom and tenseness of its atmosphere, which even if it doesn't scare you should be more than enough to excite and increase your heart rate.\n\nFor anyone not turned off by the extremely graphic violence, Dead Space is a must play. It excels at pulling you into its world and keeping you absorbed in it through an increadible atmophere that goes almost unmatched. With every step forward developer EA Redwood Shore (now renamed to the more fitting Visceral Games) show an acute knowledge of game design, never content to reiterate something already done without making it their own, and is does more for the horror action genre than probably any game since RE4. I was blown away with every passing moment, and cannot wait to dive into what horrors the future games hold. If you haven't already taken a trip aboard the Ishimura, there's no better time than now to do so, as I can assure you its a journey you won't soon forget.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 6, 2014","true","12.4"," 117 of 130 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","117","130","0","4"

It almost succeeds to a point. Tense and fraught with danger, the suspense (coupled with the awesome sound design which truly heightens the atmosphere to harrowing levels) is almost unbearable at times. Every corridor you traverse holds some nasty alien surprise lying in wait to decapitate or gut you to pieces. The game sets up a fantastically eerie environment from the get-go and it feels like you live the game as you play it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339686702\nDead Space begins its tale after a distress signal is sent out by the USG Ishimura, a "planetcracker" starship initially sent out on a mining operation by the Concordance Extraction Corporation. Taking on the role of engineer, Isaac Clarke, you soon find yourself stranded on the Ishimura after a system malfuntion causes the ship you are travelling in to investigate the ongoings onboard the Ishimura, crashes into its dock. The game uses a system of audio logs scattered around this "haunted house in space" to unfold the terryifing events that lead to the demise of most of the ships inhabitants.\n\nDead Space does not make use of the traditional heads-up display instead opting to offer you all the information you need via holographic projections emited from the gear that you wear. This keeps the screen clear and works fantastically by keeping you fully immersed in the horrors that begin to unfold once you board the ill-fated Ishimura.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339686128\nBeing a survival horror don't expect ammunition to be lying around every single corner so the player needs to make sure that every shot counts when trying to take down these monstrosities. You can easily stock up on ammunition at the various shops set up around the spaceship but money is in very short supply and the ammunition itself is not cheap so often the player will find themselves in a situation where choices need to be made. Does one sacrifice extra ammo in favor of buying a medi-pack for healing or a node for upgrading weapons? This is not a game where you can have your cake and eat it.\n\nI enjoyed the fact that Visceral Games chose to go for the amputating of various body parts to bring enemies down rather than the usual stock standard shot to the head that is the common norm in shooters these days. Where Dead Space unfortunately falters is with its clichéd story (an alien hive mind and artifacts form the backbone of the story). From a pure storytelling experience there is nothing new here that hasn't been told before countless times in other mediums.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=339687356\nThe gamer is left playing a mute protagonist, Isaac Clarke, who doesn't say a word throughout the game to the various characters he comes into contact with which ultimately leaves him as one of those personality-less heroes that I found a bit difficult to rally around in the age of Commander Sheppard and Ezio Auditore.\n\nCriticisms aside - the game is still a scarily good time with headphones cranked up to full and the lights turned off! The keyboard/mouse combo is a bit of a mess - you can see this is a console port through and through - but plug in a windows 360 controller and you are pretty much good to go.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","November 26, 2013","true","38.6"," 131 of 167 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","131","167","0","4"

While I did not find this game to be much of a "horror" like how I think of Amensia I did find it to be a very good action-thriller.\n\nTools as Weapons\n+ Weapons and Gear can be upgraded\n\nNormally you would pick up a gun, and shoot aliens, however in this game you modify your tools to become weapons, each expressing its own style and functionality, constantly becoming powerful based how way you upgrade, really helps  blowing off limbs from alien hordes.\n\nRole as Engineer\n+ Repairing sections of the ship varies\n\nPlaying as a engineer feels very aethentic, repairing the ship, one section at a time feels not only rewarding but exciting, watching it come to life the further you go down the rabbit hole, while upgrading your gear along the way to avoid being overcome by the monsters laying in wait.\n\nEnemies\n+ Good Variety of Enemies\n+ Limb System adds dynamic ways to deal with enemy\n\nThere is a good selection of enemies and bosses to blow apart in this game. Brought me back to the days when games like doom had alot of variety in monsters. Their weaknesses being their limbs is also very interesting and somehow at the same time disturbing to a degree. A shame you cannot make any snowmen out of their limbs would be a real good scare for the children.\n\nConclusion\nFor those who want to play a game where you play as a engineer who goes through a isolated spaceship and blast the limbs off your enemy I do not know why you are still reading this.\n\nDisclaimer: You might get so used to using tools as weapons that you go into your shed and modify everything into weapons and walk out like a berserker in a RPG fully geared to rock and load.","December 5, 2013","true","27.8"," 46 of 53 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","46","53","0","0"

I played it bit by bit over time and it was quite enjoyable.\n\nAlthough it's in the horror genre, I didn't find it to be too scary, instead it felt like a slower-paced FPS dungeon crawler in space, which was great.\n\n\nI loved the theme of using engineering tools as weapons, and they made things interesting by making it more effective to dismember the enemies rather than just shooting for headshots or at the center of mass.\n\n\nThere are a few caveats though.\n\nIt is not a very good port. The mouse cursor feels terrible by default. You can fix the in-game mouse by locking the framerate to 60fps (see the PC Gaming Wiki[pcgamingwiki.com] for info) and use the keyboard for the inventory and menus.\n\nI also didn't care for the default camera view, so increasing the FOV using the Widescreen Fixer app[widescreenfixer.org] helped a lot. I set mine to +0.31.\n\n\nIn all, it was a good game and I am looking forward to moving on in the series, hoping that a little more thought was put into the ports for the sequels.","June 19, 2015","true","42.5"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","32","36","4","0"

There’s much to understand, the whole cause of chaos experience in the Ishimura is not only explained in DS1 but also in other forms of media such as Books, Animated Movies, Graphics novels, a Wii Game and even a little Mobile game (How cute).  No Spoilers here but there are many things that contribute to the Plot such as that Universe's Primary "religion" (AKA- Cult) called Unitology.\n+Speaking of Story, a Bulk of the Backstory, is found from Logs within the Levels (Well Hidden of course.) This really Helps the Player understand Many Characters, Events and even teaches them how to play Zero-G Basketball!!\n+The HUD is very Realistic; it is Projected outwards in front of Isaac's face when he walks. Want to Rummage through Ammo while a battle is happening? You will most likely Die...\n+The Difficulties are very balanced for the types of gamer out there, from a simple run and gun easy difficulty with lots of supplies (Almost too many) to the Impossible mode which has fewer checkpoints, OP Enemies, hardly any Supplies (Just the way i like it), Bad Starting Suits, Few upgrades and a loss of that checkpoint instantly if you close/exit the game at all. That’s for the Hard-core Gamer who prefers a true horror Experience.\n+Loading Times? Where?\n+Atmosphere is undoubtedly the game’s biggest Strong Point. an almost empty ships filled with Necromorphs ( which are actually the ships deceased crew that, due to an Alien Virus, have Transformed into Bloodthirsty Necromorphs!..Its complicated.) that seem to be around every dark corner (There’s quite a few!) The Metallic Clang of Claws in a vent above you, or the Creaking of the Hull, or Heavy Thuds from the Asteroid belt pelting the ship are all some prime examples of how well the game deals with the unique atmosphere. It’s a Mix of Event Horizon, The Thing and even System Shock 2!\n+Scares a-plenty!\n+Extremely Innovative targeting Mechanic= Strategic Dismemberment, go for the Limbs..\n+Sound is Very Realistic and Proportional, some moments you have to stand still and be quiet to hear where the necromorph is crawling... -----\n+Weapon Options are plentiful\n+Interesting Currency and requirements to get some Credits\n+Upgradable Suits (up to 6 levels!)\n+HUD is very informative, you will hardly ever get lost with the 3D map Design\n+New Game Plus Ability (Definietely Worth it)\n+Boss Battles are Excellent and each are around the right length as well.\nHuge Alien Creatures vs Puny Engineer with a Bulky Suit but Heavy Weapons and\nBadass "Gadgets"= Interesting/Gory Results!\n+Death Animations, Mortal Kombat meets the Thing! Blood will be spilled, then\npoured and then Splashed! (R18 for this reason!)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567447111\nCons:-The Story is handled very slowly, which is bad for fast paced gamers. Easy to\nNormal Mode should be the Right speed for most players.\n-By Default, the Mouse Sensitivity and Smoothing is Very awkward and irregular.\n-Crashes during Big Battles, with lots on the screen. Very rare though.\n-Linear Levels with little Variaton. Although you are on the Ship it would be\nnice to see differently themed levels.\n-Lack of Interactive Items in levels\n-Many Collectibles can be too Difficult to find in 1 or even 2 playthroughs,\nguide recommended.\n-Save File can be Overwritten Accidentally due to placement when you are\nsaving!!\n-Characters are hardly touched apon in detail. Little Emotional Connection\nbetween the Player and Isaac! (Which is not good, because of his Motivations)\n-No Co-op, would have added a slightly more action feel. (Good and Bad)\n-No Achievements, Minor really.\n-Graphics issues include: Stuttering,Frame Drops and bad resolution by default.\n-Backtracking during the early parts up the Middle is really irritating!\n\nFinal Thoughts?It has lots of replay value with suits and upgrades to try out\nBut id recommend buying during a sale since its been out for about 8 Years!!\n(Already??)\nIts a Good Game just By Itself without the Sequels to steer the Underlying\nPlot. (This is Because the other 2 PC games are more action orientated)\nDefinetely a Wise choice for a Horror game Fan/Collector.\nIt has aged well too, using many innovative features that would be on the level\nof many horror games today!\nIsaac Clarke the Everyday Engineer turned Space-Hero, has a Realistic Feel to\nit that fits well with the Plot.\n\nFinal Score: 8/10!...Now wheres that Peng?\n-Kyle\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610927147","April 20","true","26.2"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/recommended/17470/","whoota","[T-A!] Whoota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/","307 products in account","Steven King, that very prolific author, delineates three types of fear. First is the gross-out, or disgust; the thing you want to get away from. The second is horror, the unkown; an aversion to things that you do not quite understand. And finally there is terror, the creepiness; when something is so close to being normal, but off by a tiny bit that makes it completely uncomfortable to look at. Dead Space wants to be scary, so it taps into all three fears. However, it ultimately relies more on disgust and the jump-scare than anything else.\n\nDead Space is a third person survival shooter set in space. You play Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent to repair the deep-space mining craft 'Ishimura'. Unfortunately, the ship is overrun with space-zombies called necromorphs and something really shifty is going on there so your job quickly becomes to get off that metal hunk before you're brutally murdered.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Dead Space is more like a shooter than a horror game. The trope of horror is invoked, with the shadows creeping along the walls and monsters scurrying in the vents while you can only hope they don't jump you when you're looking the other way. When the horror subsides the gross-out takes over as the monsters are disgusting amalgamtions of bodyparts with claws where hands used to be and tentacles from every orifice looking to turn you into deli-meat if you don't shred them before they get in your face. Is the game terrifying at any time? Once, in a cutscene for a second or so, but when you do the math, Dead Space is a survival disgust shooter.\n\nThe reason why it isn't horror is because you get a good glimpse and understanding of your foes. The necromorphs all waddle toward you and they'll let you pick them off. Dead Space does not work quite like most zombie games. Necromorphs are completely unimpressed when you behead them. No, you have to dismember them; tear them limb from limb. This creates for some cool gameplay mechanics where you'll aim for the legs to slow them down and then tear their arms off to finish the job. Yet, some enemies require a more measured approach where you have to get around them or prevent them from falling in the first place, otherwise they'll spawn more trouble. Occasionally one will get the drop on you, but you're not scared of the creeps; you're spooked, anxious and thrilled, but not fearful. You're armed to the teeth to such an extent that you only really fear for your life, and that is classified as suspense.\n\nDead Space plays much like Resident Evil 4 and 5 in terms of controls. You aim with a laser pointer and use your ammo conservatively. You can use special powerups to slow enemies down or to throw the set pieces at them. You're a veritable slayer of monsters and everytime you gear up with new tools you start to look the part as well. What also helps the suspenseful atmosphere is the intergrated HUD. You don't have a screen overlay; your health and ammo are displayed on your character's model and interacting with the world is done in the same manner. It creates a keen level of immersion that not many shooters can attain.\n\nWhen all is said and done, Dead Space makes good use of its atmosphere and lighting to build suspense and to release that tension at the best moments. You're on the edge of your seat, holding on for dear life as you fight off the hordes of disgusting creatures. Even the bossfights are a well measured and carefully calculated ordeal that keep you sucked in and fighting for survival without resorting to cheap set-pieces or quick-time events. Dead Space is an amazingly atmospheric thrill shooter that needs to played if only for its amazing presentation.","March 4, 2015","true","14.1"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","0"

Dead Space is possibly not a horror game for me, it has some jumpscares and sometimes when a new enemy appeared I kinda freaked out trying to learn how to defeat him. The game itself relies on the dismemberment of enemy limbs in order to kill them, it also features some puzzle "sections" where you need to manipulate gravity and slow down "stuff" using your stasis in order to complete a certain objective. The soundtrack really keeps up the rythm and the action of the game with some intense sections where the music pumps in. Now, as far as I'm aware the PC version was ported from the 360 version and somehow (I doubt it's just me) they forgot to get rid of the mouse acceleration and smoothing which really annoyed me quite some times but once you get used to it, it's all good. Now, for me, the strongest point of Dead Space has to be the story, it's kinda "unique" per say and I really dig into these sort of religion fanatics messing up with alien tech. Another thing I must say is that the developers really put alot of effort into making the game world "realistic", across the USG Ishimura you'll find various advertising panels some of which are different and I feel like those small additions to the world design really make it unique and engaging. I believe I have nothing else to say about Dead Space besides telling you to go give it a try if you haven't played or beated it yet.","September 7, 2013","true","15.0"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suprememessage/recommended/17470/","Suprememessage","Harmonic Revelations","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Suprememessage/","271 products in account","A classic example of atmospheric horror that will, surely, stand the test of time and remain as one of the best horror games,  and one of the best sci-fi games, I've ever played. I have a lot to talk about for this one kiddies, so grab some popcorn or something. I won't spoil anything for you either, so don't worry about that, if you haven't beaten the game yet\n\n\nSOUND:\n____\nFirst and foremost: One of the most important pieces of any horror game is effective sound design. I didn't notice it as much on my first playthrough, sadly, because I only played in Stereo, but I went back recently and replayed the whole game in Surround Sound, high volume, with headphones, and oh boy, did I have a lot of pants to replace. Players aren't going to jump if a group of Necormorphs ambush them while the Betty Hill theme is playing in the background, likewise, the whispers you can hear throughout the ship wouldn't be as effective if they were accompanied by a vuvuzuela. In that sense, this game exceeds all expectations. They use just the right sound, every click, inhuman gurgle, and automated announcement falls so perfectly into place that you'll surely be looking over your shoulder.\n\nAgain, to experience this, play at high volume with surround sound headphones. I guarantee you, the difference in fear is like night and day. On my first playthrough with just stereo, that I did years ago, I didn't even flinch once at any scares, on my most recent playthrough, with surround sound, I cried at least five times.\n\nThe soundtrack is scary enough that even listening to it out of the game makes me feel like I should be on edge, looking over my shoulder. Beautiful composition, that fits perfectly with the world established by the game.\n\nThe sound aspect of Dead Space scores a 10/10 from me. Suberb job, every audio-design student should play this at least once to see how much of an effect using sound correctly can have on a person's experience. It's the difference between confidently strolling down a corridor and hesitantly walking down it, moving your legs oddly as your legs are soaked in fear-urine.\n____\n\nGRAPHICS:\n___\n\nBy graphics, I don't mean 'oh look how high-definition this texture is!", I feel like people put too high of a value on that. A game can have 1080p textures and still look like digital vomit. No, what I mean is how appealing a game looks, the over-all design and how it flows together, immersing you.\n\nDead Space's graphics are as good as the sound: They make you paranoid, even. The subtle way the gray hallways seem to endlessly blur together, mixed with the scratching of something following you, will make most people, myself included, feel intensely claustrophobic.\n\nIt's beautiful how every texture, every object, seems to flow into eachother, all of them playing into the theme that 'I really, REALLY shouldn't be here". From the uncanny way the monsters still retain 'just' enough of their human appearance, to the way certain vents blend into the floor so you can't tell a monster may pop out, to the way the lighting may be just dim enough you dread the idea something may pop out, Dead Space has got you covered.\n\nThe Ishimura feels like a real ship, every deck feels just unique enough, yet consistent enough you can tell it's part of the same ship. It serves to further create an atmosphere of tension and loneliness.\n\nDead Space's graphics get a 10/10.\n\n\n____\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n____\n\nDead Space's gameplay is superb, but not a 'perfect' experience by any means. There are both pros and cons to the resource management. While at times it can correctly make situations more tense, at other times it just raises my blood pressure and makes me want to punch my monitor.\n\nIt's a mixed bag as far as resource management goes, while the combat remains fairly standard. It's a point, click, you're dead kind of deal, with very little variation between the best ways to dispatch monsters.\n\nThere isn't much to say about the gameplay, it's average. 7/10.\n\n___\n\nSTORY (No Spoilers: Don't worry)\n___\n\nI'm going to be vague here to avoid spoiling anything, but the story of Dead Space is an emotional rollercoaster, and I craved more, and more as time went on. I was truly interested in fully understanding what went on on the Ishimura, and learning all I could about the crew who manned her. Furthermore, seeing how the characters interacted actually played out quite nicely, and their treatment of eachother was rather realistic. I myself have seen work environments where people act like that in real life, so it was refreshing to see actual human-like characters.\n\nThe mystery, suspense, and all out dread is flawless. It has an odd balance where not knowing what's happening is horrifying, but understanding exactly what's happening is JUST AS SCARY. It's a weird trait that I don't see too often in horror games anymore. Most of the time, when you learn the mechanics behind the monsters in a horror game, their motives, their origins, it removes some fear, it grounds them into a Earthly point of view where you can try to understand. But in Dead Space, it's like the more you understand the more otherworldly your situation truly seems. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat. This is a game where you HAVE to read all the text logs and listen to the audio-logs, or else you'll miss a big chunk of the experience, and believe me when I say all of the video/audio/text logs are written well enough that they're juicy and will leave you pondering them.\n\nDead Space has one of my favorite game universes of all time, and for that the story gets a 10/10.\n___\n\n\nOVERALL:\n___\n\nOverall, Dead Space is a stellar (Heh, see what I did there?) example of a truly genius execution of the decades old concept of being stranded in space with monsters all around. May Dead Space long live as an example to both the sci-fi and horror game developer and player communities as an example of when things are done right.\n\nFor decades to come, I imagine Dead Space will still stand as one of the best horror games ever made, and THE best horror game franchise that EA's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t marketing ever ruined.\n\n9.9/10\n\nAnd remember, there's always Peng.","July 9, 2015","true","52.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","19","23","3","0"

Your mission is to repair the spaceship USG Ishimura, a huge mining vessel that carves out chunks from planets and harvests the valuable ore. Shortly after they arrive on board all hell breaks loose. Their craft is destroyed, leaving them stranded on the Ishimura. The crew is attacked by nightmarish creatures. Seperated from the others it is up to Isaac to wander the halls, search for any friends or survivors that are still alive and fix as many problems as he can until he can find a way to escape the ship.\nThe setting is where the game shines. It definitely feels like you are in deep space. There are sections in a vacuum, things sound differently as you would expect if you were in an airless environment. You also have a small air supply that will run out if you are not quickly. There are other parts where there is no gravity and you can leap from floor to ceiling or walk up the sides of a wall.\nA cool aspect is that there is no HUD. Health is displayed on the back of your suit and ammunition is displayed when you hold up your weapon.\nAnother interesting feature is the holographic screens that appear throughout the ship and when someone is talking to you. All elevators and doors have one of these screens instead of a standard switch.\nThe graphics are good. It has great lighting effects, textures, and models.\nThe sounds also really help with the immersion. You will sometimes hear random clanking, footsteps, or alien grunts and shrieks that keep you on your toes. The music gets intense when you are under attack by a group of aliens and is kind of spacey when you are just exploring alone.\nOverall, if you like blood, gore, horror and action you should try Dead Space.

You are slow moving with jump out and scare you moments. The character Issac controls slow and clunky. Plus your character Issac Clark takes up a lot of the screen, which I guess happens in a lot of over the shoulder shooters. You want to see what's behind you. Since this is an over the shoulder shooter, things can easily sneak up on your left side, even more so than behind you.\n\nThe game drips with atmosphere, horror and gore, but it doesn't feel scary. Maybe I'm just used to horror games, or maybe its the fact when you run through a dead enemy, you kick it like a soccer ball and it flops like a rag doll fish. That's probably why Doom 3 had its dead enemies burn into nothing. With Dead Space, the idea is that enemies can still be alive... when they look dead. The game looks awesome and makes great use of lighting and shadow. You won't be in dark areas so much as dim areas with lights shining through vents. It has a great look to it.\n\nDead Space boasts strategic dismemberment, such as first cutting off a leg of an enemy, before you cut off its head. If you cut off its head, it will blindly swing at you. If you cut off its leg, it will crawl and lunge at you. Most enemies are like this. Other enemies might explode with smaller, more annoying enemies if you're inaccurate. There are also reanimating enemies that take priority, because they'll monsterfy every dead body in the room. So if you're the type of gamer that likes aim over put more bullets into it, this game is for you! The enemies will even work their way through vents if you've gone to another room and they'll pop out. The vents are pretty easy to spot, but a lot of vents are on the ceiling.\n\nThere are four major weapons in the game, the line cutter, flame thrower, plasma rifle and some sort of saw gun. It is unfortunate that you'll end up primarily using the weapon you start with for the entire game. That feels like a wasted opportunity. The flame thrower feels extremely weak if not completely useless.\n\nYou're able to collect items, like health, ammo, air canisters for when you're walking in space and its all contained in your limited inventory. When you upgrade your 'rig' (suit), you can carry more stuff, but for the most part, since everything is sellable, you'll rarely run out of room. As the game starts, there is plenty of ammo, but at around six hours in, ammo gets scarce, but you can still buy more. Lack of ammo comes from missing vulnerable points of enemies and having them explode into smaller points.\n\nYou'll also pick up node modules to upgrade things and if you start upgrading your line cutter, then why would you ever switch to a different weapon? Plus, any ammo that you get for other weapons, you can just sell at one of the game's stores for credits that you can use to buy more line cutter ammo. There are locked rooms that you can use a node to get into, but since nodes are one of the most valuable and costly items in the game, it might not be worth the risk to see what's in the mystery room. You'll also be able to explore and find items in cabinets, lockers and smashable boxes, but you really can't wander too far off the beaten path.\n\nTraversing the USG Ishimura feels like there is plenty of back tracking, with some getting lost. Luckily there is a 3D slightly difficult to use map. For the most part, each level is contained into branching segments, you'll start at the root of the map tree, clear out one branch and all of its limbs, end up at the root / hub of the level, then go for the next branch area. Sadly some of the 'chapters' reuse levels. The USS Ishimura is a big space ship, and I would call it similar to Metroid-Vania-ish since you'll revisit areas of a ship, but its all broken into 'chapters' that you can't return to unless its in the storyline to return to that section.\n\nThere are some puzzles, but nothing major. You'll get powers like telekinesis to move objects and a slow down stasis to solve puzzles and get through areas. Without the puzzles, the game seems easy even on normal difficulty.\n\nThe game has a very painful key binding system, especially for lefties. While you can rebind keys, you can't rebind all keys, so I recommend just using a controller. The controller works great and has simple controls for a complex system. You've got buttons for run, inventory, aim, stomp (to downed enemies and boxes), melee attack (which seems useless), use button and the D-pad will call your 4 weapons to switch. When you're aimed at something, you can reload, fire your weapon. alt-fire, use telekinesis or stasis to slow anything down.\n\nThankfully save points and checkpoints are everywhere. It keeps the game progressing, but another negative of the game is when you run out of ammo or health and just can't pass a section, you're locked into that section. When you're stuck, you've got two choices, run all the way back to a store at the start of a level, or sometimes you might just have to restart from a save point. This is why I can understand EA's desire to throw micro transactions into the game. If you get stuck with no ammo, no credits and only have 1 save file, you might literally have to restart the game. When you get 10+ hours in, that will kill your desire to play.\n\nIn all, the game feels good to play, despite how slow it is. If you enjoy typical space horror with the plot of Aliens, this game is for you! The game has been $5 on Steam and free on Origin. Chances are if you wait, there will be a sale, a bundle or a free download.","August 12, 2012","true","22.8"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

While some games fail when trying to do too much, Dead Space is able to do all of these parts well and deliver a satisfying experience from start to finish.\n\nDead Space progresses very nicely from start to finish. The story is intriguing and, while horrifying space creatures is nothing new, presents a well rounded and detail/lore filled experience that took some thought to follow. The opening sequence leads very nicely right into the action, immediately making you want to find out just what happened to that ship.\n\nAs far as firefights go, this game offers some intense sequences. Whenever I overcame a hoard of enemies I felt like a badass, but I always hoped that an engagement like that wouldn't happen again. This may be what Dead Space does best: present you in an environment that makes you uncomfortable, leave you feeling exposed at all times, and give you just enough to get the job done if you do it right and think on your feet.\n\nThat being said, I found the biggest flaws in the game to also center around the combat situations. While there are plenty of action sequences in the game, it is not as smooth as other action games, which is of course fine as this isn't the initial purpose. However, some sequences and enemies felt cheap to me when you meet them. The enemies are varied, challenging, and interesting as a whole, but some sequences are downright frustrating. Often this happens when an objective is not fully clear or your purpose is not adequately explained. I don't expect a game to hold my hand, but when it isn't clear what that button you just pressed does, but swarms of enemies come out of the vents, it can become exhasperating. Fortunately, this doesn't happen too often.\n\nThe progression system in Dead Space is very good and rewarding. You can build your loadout to your playstyle and upgrade equipment to suit your strengths. Dead Space offers a variety of weapons to use and tactics to implement to keep battles fresh and fun.\n\nI would definitely recommend Dead Space, even though it is a few years old. It is still a great game, and at a discount during Christmas or summer for $5 simply can't be missed.","October 8, 2014","true","15.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Packed with jump scares. The monsters are straight out of the 80's movie “The Thing”, with almost an Event Horizon style of design to the ship. There is a nice leveling up system, and there are some interesting weapons. There is even some Zero G action, which was a nice touch. The game does have a frustrating part at the end of chapter 4, but before you rage quit put down your 360 controller and grab your gaming mouse (solves the problem trust me). Dead Space is definitely one to buy on steam sale if you haven’t played it. The game being older runs well on a most systems (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2012 and up should be fine). The only thing that could have made this better would be some co-op, but it may have killed some of the atmosphere. Turn off the lights, crank up the volume, and get ready.

While this is good news it still does not change the fact that this game sucks with KB/M. Also to anyone who disagrees with me, please post a comment telling me why.\n\nThis review is for the PC version only. I love this game, and have played it all the way through around four times. In my opinion, this game has one of the best horror atmospheres ever. Although its almost all jump scares, it kept me on my toes the entire game. The story was good enough to keep me entertained, and the use of audio logs was amazing. Nothing really wrong with the base game, a perfect jump-horror game. My HUGE issue with the PC port is the horrid control issues. Even on max sensitivity, it would take entire seconds to turn the camera around, and only through notepad tweaking could I make it bearable. This "solution" would ultimately create a form of mouse acceleration, so the movement was still not smooth. V-Sync is horribly tied into this game, which I believe is what causes this issues. Please buy this amazing game, but on a console, and tell the developers to stop putting out unacceptable PC ports.\n\nPros:\n+Loads fast\n\nNegatives:\n-Absolutely unplayable\n\nOverall: 1/10 Do NOT buy this version, but please get it on console.

I don't know how and why the Dead Space series has slipped over the years, but Dead Space 1 was always the best Dead Space and a genre defining game.  In fact, no one has really created a game where there are space zombies, you fight these things in space, combined with scare and horror with the dread of being alone.  You are truly alone in space.\n\nDead Space 2 was great too but no where as near as great as Dead Space.  It's one of those games that left an imprint in my recollection of gaming experiences along with Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, Street Fighter, Goldeneye 64, Lost Odyssey, Valkyria Chronicles, Halo series, and a few others.\n\nThe Dead Space Universe is where the heart is.  There's vast potential.  The world of Dead Space is intriguing, and when well written, developed, and executed, it's the definitive space zombie game with a major twist.  But to call it space zombie is a hit from the hilt.  It's a lot more than that.  They're called necromorphs, and they're terrifying.  Horrific.  They terrorize your soul.\n\nThe premise of Dead Space is overwhelming with potential possibilities that could bring the series back to life.  Dead Space 4, if it happens, will hopefully revisit the memories of the first game.  It's a must-play, sit in a dark room, with your headphones on video game.  Immerse yourself fully into its atmosphere and it will be one of the best times you've spent playing a game.\n\nRating: 9.2 out of 10","November 30, 2013","true","0.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","3"

Fleshy bits make an appropriate "squish" when shot, and guns have an appropriate "oomph" to them.\n\n-Good variety of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Slashers are fast, but have exposed legs, Pregnomorphs are slow, but hard to take down without spilling their "cargo" all over the floor, etc. Other types of enemies have other weaknesses.\n\n-The A.I. is pretty good. Enemies will charge you if you turn your back, pop out of vents that are close to you, swarm you all at once rather than one at a time, etc.\n\n-The story is good, but it does have its issues, as I will state in the Con's section.\n\n-Voice acting is good, none of the actor's sound like they "phoned it in." While the main protagonist Isaac Clarke doesn't talk, he does make grunts, yells, and appropriately heavy breathing noises when necessary.\n\n-Environmental design is great, cargo rooms and mechanical stations are open, crew rooms are more enclosed, with tighter corridors, etc. Rooms are in places that make sense (i.e, no engine room on the opposite end of the ship from where the engines are.)\n\n-They story is pretty decently lengthed, I've beaten this game several times (mainly on console) and it still takes me around 8 hours or so. I'd imagine it would probably take a newer player around 10-12 hours to beat.\n\n-Character design is good, no one is stereotypical, and each character is decently memorable.\n\n-I enjoyed the audio and video log collecting, which helped expand on the backstory and helps determine just what happened aboard the  Ishimura  (the name of the ship you board.)\n\n-There's a good variety of weapons, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There's also different suit levels you can get, which work well and look cool at the same time.\n\n-You can upgrade your weapons, armor, Statis unit (slows down enemies and objects), and kinesis unit (pick up objects from a distance) using "Power Nodes" you find throughout this ship or bought through the Store aboard the ship.\n\n-Each weapon also has an "alt fire" mode to it. The plasma cutter changes from horizontal to vertical shooting (more useful than you might think) the Pulse Rifle fires in a circle, etc.\n\n-Anti-gravity areas are cool, but could have been done better. (They are done better in Dead Space 2 and 3.)\n\n-There's more positive aspects, but that covers most of the main bits.\n\n-The game also likes to mess with you in small ways, areas that were safe most of the game may not be safe anymore, some enemies come out of unexpected areas, the game tenses you up for a scare that doesn't happen (but it's done well, and on purpose.)\n\nThe Con's\n\n-Aiming is a bit iffy with a mouse and keyboard, turning of V-Sync helps, which you have to do both in the in-game settings and in the .cfg files for it to actually work. However, I'd recommend playing with a controller if possible, if not, you can still play the game quite well with a M/KB.\n\n-While I stated earlier that the story was pretty good, it's not without flaws. For the most part you are the secondary protagonists *itch for most of the game, doing something or other for them, sometimes when it's something they could do themselves. Not to say they sit on their butts all game, but still.\n\n-This game also follows the horror game trope of magically seperating you from you allies when a situation arises. Granted, it doesn't do it as often as other games and sometimes you even meet up with them. (Who'da thunk it?)\n\n-As I said, this game has a cool variety of weapons, but for a more skilled player, they are unnecessary. I can make it through this game with just the Plasma Cutter and the Pulse Rifle as my weapons, not even touching the others. On console, I've even done an entire run through of the game with  only  the Plasma Cutter.\n\n-The A.I. is good, but it does have its..... moments. I've seen Necromorphs pop out of vents, only to hop right back in and pop out somewhere farther away from me. I've also seen the A.I. not want to walk through doorways that lead out of the area, but are willing to hop in a vent and pop out of a vent that  is  in that new area, for reasons I assume that involve the games pathfinding.\n\n-The game also can get repetitive after a while, not that it's not fun, but some Necromorph encounters do get predictable (mainly entering a new area and Necromorphs almost immediately showing up.)\n\n-The game has puzzles (not that I mind), but almost all of them are pretty basic and easy (at least to me) and don't offer much challenge.\n\n-Controls are tanky (much like Resident Evil 4), which is fine, but in some areas of the game (mainly anti-grav and space areas) these controls can get semi-annoying and cumbersome.\n\n-The game just isn't that scary for me, it's pretty decently thrilling the first time you play it, and its got its tense moments, but I was never crapping my pants in horror or dreading to go in the next room. I am also hard to scare however, while some people are quite the opposite.\n\nNitpicks and Personal Annoyances\n\n-The amount of settings are decent, but nothing to write home about, and I was disappointed by some options that were missing.\n\n-The game isn't very optimized, I can play Dead Space 2 with higher settings than this one and run higher frames, yet I play this game with the same settings and get noticeably lower frames per second.\n\n-Another reason to turn V-Sync off (as if there weren't enough already) is that it causes a noticeably annoying "dragging" feel to your mouse, this is especially present in the Main Menu and the Pause Menu.\n\n-This isn't an annoyance, but playing this game with headphones is a good idea, it helps you find enemies easier, helps you get more enthralled in the atmosphere, and just makes it an overall better experience.\n\n\nIf I had to give this game a number review it would probably be a 9/10. (It'd be higher without the wonky V-Sync and mild control problems.)\n\nAnd finally: TL:DR -MUST PLAY, BUT 2 SPOOKY 4 ME.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 14, 2014","true","14.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I played it alot on pirated version, when i didn't even have a Steam, so don't pay too much attention about play time, just replayed it one more time on the hardest difficulty.\n\nSo, what is this game?\n- First of all. NECROMORPHS! Yus, they are the key feature of this game, you will love them alot. They are very, very interesting, funny, lovely, and cute. But to be honest, ugly as hell, and sometimes Ishimura reminds hell really nice.\n- Atmosphere. It has amazing sounds, scenes, and environment. Just don't forget to listen to sounds a little more, and you will feel yourself uncomfortable.\n- Effort, length. Dayum, this game is longer, than 50% of our time's horrors. And very, very well made. Reading and listening to every note is making a wonderful feeling of very deep atmosphere.\n- Great OST. I don't have any words for it. Had a feeling, that actually it's not a music, but real sounds.\n\nWhy i didn't say anything negative about game?\nBecause... Urgh, don't even know. I don't think, that this game has something to let people ragequit, except jumpscares.\n\nWell. I'm giving to it 10\10, beause it's playable unreally good in our time too.

The atmosphere and story that this game delivers is just that:  Horror.  The player experiences a sense of dread with every sound, or when rounding a corner.  The developers have said they were influenced by several different horror movies, but the two that shine through most notably are "Event Horizon" and John Carpenter's adaptation of "The Thing".  The story itself revolves around a planetcracker mining vessel known as the USG Ishimura, that sends out a distress signal from the planet Aegis VII.  You play as the engineer, Isaac Clarke, who is dispatched with a small crew to investigate the aforementioned distress signal.

Going back how does it hold up today? A bit on the good, a bit on the bad it seems.\n\nFirst off know that if you like horror games and have never picked up the series then there’s really no reason not to play the game. Despite some of its shortcomings it’s still a deeply immersive experience. Though I think the series as a whole gets lauded as “thah scuriest games evurh!” far too often (as you’ll eventually become used to its brand of trying to scare you and begin predicting where the next enemy is coming from) that doesn’t change the fact that the environments are excellently crafted, deeply foreboding, and the gameplay is fun if not perfect.\n\nIn fact while I believe the later games certainly improved on the mechanics, and I eventually grew to like Isaacs voice (he’s silent in this one), I think overall this game creates a far better atmosphere. You rarely if ever feel safe, the graphics while aged still look nice, and unlike the later entries unless you’re playing on the easiest difficulty or two (or are a horror god) you’ll be rationing supplies to an extent. Additionally while some dislike it I quite liked the fact that except for a few rare occasions almost all communication with others is done via radio, true it isn’t as cinematic as later entries, but it gives the distinct impression that only you can save yourself and no help is coming. It’s true that thanks to an upgrade system most people do feel rather powerful by the end, but you have to work toward that and in the early to middle game it’s true survival horror.\n\nAs for the bad, well as I said later games improved on the mechanics and that’s because some of the mechanics are broken. The big mechanic of “shoot the limbs” is completely missed by the inclusion of weapons that can do just as much damage shooting for the core (it can be fun to play through with only the base weapon and it is perfectly effective, but isn’t required and if you’re just breezing through can totally be skipped). The Zero-G sections are awe inspiringly painful to play, you’ll get the hang of it but because you have no control and can only jump from point-to-point it isn’t fun. And the physics are all over the place as well as the hit-boxes at times, especially where stomping or some of the more concentrated weapons are concerned.\n\nThere’s also a small factor that never really bothered me but I see brought up all the time so it’s worth mentioning. This game truly is “fetch quest, the FPS”. Though the underlying plotline, the history, and the environment of the ship itself are all very interesting the actual activities you’re asked to complete aren’t. EVERYTHING is broken and because the other survivors are a bunch of sissy pants you literally get to fix a starship as a one-man engineering crew. The fact that the other elements are so strong glossed over this for me, but lots of people note it and I can’t deny its truth.\n\nIn short the game is still a classic. Some of it hasn’t aged as well as other parts but like great horror games from the very start of gaming chances are you’ll easily forgive those things in light of the overwhelming positives.","November 2, 2015","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So far the title has been an absolute thrill, with tension and terror at every turn, some physical and some psychological. The backstory of the game is very deep, with you being able to control the character Isaac in an attempt to escape a ship  filled with the undead alive, preferably with his allies and his wife, who is lost onboard. The background is explored through lost recordings, some video, audio, and text, as well as the environment itself.\n\nThe title itself is very unsettling, as even bumping into a beer can will startle you. Undead can appear behind you, in front of you, above you, all around you. It was fairly challenging on medium, with an option for Easy, Hard, and an unlockable Impossible mode, which I haven't tried out yet. Items can be found through schematics, bought in the store, and then upgraded through the use of nodes (items which you insert into others to make them better). The story is long, around 8-10 hours if you spend time collecting everything. The replayability factor is large enough for maybe 1 or 2 extra playthroughs, which can be spent using your fully upgraded arsenal, or upgrading it to that, and collecting logs you may have missed.\n\nThe downsides to this title are mentionable, although they don't detract from the experience very much. No steam achievements, cards, or DLC for this title. I cling to hope that EA may port their dlc to the pc, preferably in a package, although its small. I encountered a glitch, which I read is very common for pc gamers. That glitch is called the "Continue glitch", where if you start the game on any difficulty other than medium, save, exit, then click continue instead of load game, it will change your save to medium difficulty with no way to go back. I started on Easy the first play through, and it happened to me on chapter 2. This can be avoided though, although it hasn't been patched out yet. The aim is also sort of slow, but I can't tell if its a bug or if its part of the games' unique aiming itself.\n\nAll in all I rate this game a 9/10. Its a great game to start off a series but it is hindered by an almost unavoidable bug, no steam extras, and no pc DLC, although the other two versions of this game recieved it. Get it on discount and you won't regret it.\n\nhttp://www.isthereanydeal.com","March 21, 2014","true","55.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/17470/","Dukefrukem","Dukefrukem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/","811 products in account","***I originally wrote this review on 11-04-2008***\n\nCreating a successful horror game is tricky. There needs to be just enough of a blend tension, fear and scare tactics so the game does not fall to mundane generic enemies jumping out at players. Dead Space not only creates the one of the best atmospheres in a horror video game, it’s full of enough puzzles, frights and dilemmas to make even the most jaded 3rd Person Shooter player sit up and take notice.\n\nYou play as Isaac Clarke, a space engineer, traveling to the USG Ishimura, a “Planet Cracker” which is emitting a distress call. After a tense opening sequence, Isaac boards the ship with his coworkers, Lt. Zach Hammond, security officer, and Kendra Daniels, a computer expert, and soon realizes this is no ordinary distress call as the ship has been overrun by an alien race. Isaac gets separated from his coworkers and must fight his way through the alien monsters to bring the ship back online and find a way off the Ishimura.\n\nGameplay:\n\nDead Space has taken every great piece of third person gameplay in the history of video games and combines it together to deliver an entertaining, enjoyable journey. You navigate Isaac from an over-the-shoulder view. There is no Heads Up Display (HUD) in Dead Space. Your health is indicated by the light meter embedded in the spine of your suit spine. Your ammo is displayed above your weapon when you aim and your stasis meter is also located on the back of your suit. What is stasis? It is a piece of technology that gives you the ability to slow down objects and enemies for puzzle solving and reaction time. You can recharge your stasis by accessing stations located throughout the ship or by finding portable stasis packs. Isaac also has the ability to use Kinesis, which allows him to move heavy objects or acquire objects that are out of reach. Stasis becomes available to Isaac a few minutes into the game, and Kinesis becomes available for use when entering the second chapter and has unlimited use.\n\nThe game's most unique and striking appeal is operating in zero gravity or a vacuum. When entering a Zero-G zone, Isaac has the ability to jump from one side of the area to another. This opens up an new realm of puzzle solving and is some of the most fun sequences in the game.\n\nThe enemies in Dead Space are deformed humans that were killed and turned into monsters by a race of alien creatures. There are a dozen or so different styles of enemies that navigate their way through the ships ventilation system, which means you may encounter an enemy at any given time. As many enemies as there are, they all can be taken out with the same technique: begin by shooting off their limbs first. Direct hits to the body will waste ammo, especially during fights with the tougher, more advanced enemies. Some of the more memorable enemies are the epic boss fights that also combine a little Zero-G action. The threats on the ship are sometimes not always enemy related. Dead Space shifts gears twice for a little Han Solo, “Don’t Get Cocky” turret action.\n\nSo how do you take out all the enemies? With a wide range of weaponry of course. Isaac begins the game with a Cutter, an extremely accurate “laser” that fires a wide beam either horizontally or vertically. There are tons of lockers and chests to explore during the course of the game. Some lockers may contain ammo and others may contain credits, which can be used in Stores. At these Store locations, Isaac can store, ammo and items. Isaac is limited in the number of items he can carry, however the number of items can be increased if he upgrades his suit. Usually near by a store, is a Workbench, where Isaac can upgrade his weapons and gear.\n\nThere is a lot of backtracking in Dead Space. At the beginning of each chapter, Issac exits a tram which carries passengers from one section of the ship to another, and at the end of each chapter he makes his way back to the same tram to journey to the next section of the ship. Isaac visits some sections of the ship more than once. There are tons of save points throughout Dead Space, probably more than there should be. Even if you don not save, Dead Space autosaves so much that you really do not have to save once through the entire game, unless you want to exit out of Dead Space or turn off your PS3. To make the game even easier, the developers also added in a feature that actually maps out the direction Isaac needs to travel to complete his next objective. This feature is displayed by a blue outline on the ground. (see pic below)\n\nThe problem that most avid gamers will notice is that everything, aside from the zero gravity gameplay, has been borrowed from past films, novels, or other games. The over the shoulder view bares a striking resemblance to Resident Evil 4, the monsters are mere replicas of John Carpenter's The Thing, parallels in Event Horizon are seen throughout the entire game including some obvious set design rip offs and features in Doom 3 and System Shock are also used in Dead Space. It is at this point where we stop and think: are these references by the EA Readwood Game designers an homage to their favs or are they simply thefts? No matter, the similarities are not enough to take away from the Dead Space experience which delivers a terrifying story, but the influences are definitely obvious.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\n\nDead Space does everything right graphically. It looks beautiful in full 1080p when staring out into the vast ocean of space, blowing an enemies head off, or playing through some beautiful level designs of what a 'Planet Cracker's' engine room, maintenance bay and mining section may look like.\n\nThe sound effects are also top notch in Dead Space. As Isaac communicates with his team, a 2D holograph image appears before Isaac, which the player can rotate. The static overlaid onto the video and audio logs is incorporated nicely, and the creeks and cracks heard throughout the broken ship add much to the atmosphere. Listen for the lullaby.\n\nPlayers may pick up quickly on how Visceral tries to scare its players. They use the same formula that Hollywood does, during a tense or critical moment in the game they play loud music like the typical brass pieces you hear in most horror movies. More often than not this takes place when a player looks in the direction of an enemy. So this tactic may help a player in certain areas rather than scare him or her. If a player is not paying attention and some random horns start playing, that is a pretty good indication that there was probably a monster that ran past the door that they probably missed.\n\nPros: controls work extremely well on the PS3, terrifying boss battles, graphics and sound are gripping,\n\nCons: : unoriginal enemies, predictable but engaging story, very easy to beat, lots of backtracking\n\nBottom Line: I recommend this game in spite of my criticism of the unoriginality of some of its elements but it is defendable to question why this game has been so highly touted. Some have labeled Dead Space as the ‘Worlds Scariest Game’ and people are shouting from roof tops to “Buy this game immediately!”. The game isn’t perfect, but what is?

Dead Space spawned a whole host of imitators, and for good reason -- it's well-made and placed in a setting original enough to make it stand out from most third-person shooters. Great atmosphere, exceptional surround sound, and ingenious weapon design combine to make a game worth playing through to the end.\n\nUnfortunately, Dead Space suffers from some of the worst console-to-PC translation I've ever experienced. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gamepad controls make movement and aiming more painful than they need to be, and there's a hardware conflict that can cause the gamepad to do nothing but spin the camera in a 360° pattern (something that the devs never bothered to fix through the entirety of the series, amazingly enough). The unchageable FOV prevents me from playing for more than a couple hours due to motion sickness. There's also a bug that causes stuttering when vsync is enabled.\n\nThe positives definitely override the negatives though, and Dead Space is a game that should be experienced by horror aficionados and shooter fans alike.","October 9, 2013","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Forget the second and third games in the series, the first entry is it's own unique entry in the series before going completely off the rails by the third installment. What differentiates it is that the original game despite the gross-out horror and violent gore is that it is more story-driven than it's successors. The entire game plays out like a science-fiction horror film in deep space, richly establishing it's own universe and characters well before the other shoe drops, our woe-begotten protagonist and two others with him finding themselves stranded on a failing derelict ship that they had been searching for and finding no crew aboard but blood all over the place..then finding out that they're less alone than they thought and quickly having to fix the ailing ship to save themselves while defending themselves from terrifying nightmarish creatures. It sounds like a cheesy 80s thriller when I describe it that way but it's so much more than that and considering it often goes on sale for like 5 bucks these days you're certainly in for a treat.","June 18, 2015","true","56.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The third person over-the-shoulder gameplay style is similar to that of Resident Evil 4 and 5, leaving Isaac as a relatively slow but powerful tank with the ability to run when he needs to escape certain death.  It is a game that will make you question what the "right" decision is as you unravel more of the games dark story which is driven by conspiracy, betrayal, and mental insanity.

That's what this game promises which it provides to varying degrees of success. Everyone's different but it didn't take long for me to understand the game's formula enough to not be fazed by the scares. Atmosphere trickles but it doesn't surge out and suffocate you in all it's crimson glory which is disappointing, really. Ammo being scarcer would have helped build the tension as even on the hard setting you're basically Scrooge McAmmo-Man.\n\nTo combat the spacebeasts you're provided with a myriad of weapons, of which you can carry up to 4 at any given time. You can switch them out at HUBs though I only found 3 of them satisfying to use. Along with the weapons you get a couple of cool abilities which work well in harmony. Despite the pointless CQC, I found targeting limbs and blowing stuff up very fun. You also get some cool looping level design which works well in this environment and an interesting story.\n\nFrom a technical side it isn't the most proficient game out there. Cadavers tend to randomly bug out and just writhe around uncontrollably which will likely scare you more than the scripted scares. More importantly some game breaking bugs exist where the only cure may be to restart the game so save often and on multiple save files! As Nevermore didn't once say it's a Dead Love in a Dead Space.

An excellent third person shooter - although not particularly scary.  It's very immersive, and you grow to care about the characters.  There is just enough mystery in the game to keep you interested in the storyline.  The fact that there are distinctive "chapters" you complete helps you feel a sense of accomplishment while playing - beyond the fact that you’re kicking some freak-monster-zombie ♥♥♥.\n\nAmmo is somewhat scarce, which allows for a sense of urgency in the game.  The chapters are varied, and present you with all sorts of different obstacles to overcome.  The upgrade system is simple, but certainly effective.   0n normal, monsters are a little tough, but not much of a challenge.  If you're looking for something more difficult, definitely play on hard.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that with my particular graphics card - GTX 770 - some of the character models glitch out and flop all over the place. PERSONALLY I find this hysterical, and am actually happy when it happens, but I could see how for a lot of people this could be frustrating.  Ironically running fraps fixes the issue somehow.  The only part that it really affected me is during a section where a boss fight was supposed to be, the boss never spawned - I just fixed it with fraps for that part of the game and all was good.\n\nDo NOT use a mouse with this game, however, because it was poorly ported and there are problems with the mouse sensitivity/acceleration/all sorts of other things, which is known issue.  Controller is certainly best in this situation.\n","June 24, 2015","true","23.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Mouse aiming AND controller aiming are both worthless. Disabling vsync will only fix the lag and 10fps menus and 30 fps gameplay, which then leaves you with massive obvious tearing because half this game uses strobe lights. Then if you try to force vsync in AMD Panel or D3DOverrider, nothing works. RadeonPro did force vsync but it only ended up making the controls feel even worse. It will not fix the massive deadzone in your aiming. There's no analog to the aiming, or very little. You either dont move, or you turn full speed. Maybe I'm just picky but this is ridiculous.

One of the best things in this game is the backstory, through out the game you pick up audio logs and text logs which explain what happened to the ships crew.

It is very atmospheric, one of the games selling points. Oh and the soundtrack doesn't do anything to help calm the nerves. The gameplay is a bit linear, though this isn't essentially bad, as this unleashes a majority of the game's scares. The weapon range is amiable, although most players will be satisfied with the plasma cutter.The story is fairly cluttered, although the mysterious origins behind the Ishimura is welcome ambiguity. The graphics and art direction are both effective and coherent, in particular the gorgeously horrific character models. Although the enemies do get a bit repetitive, the developer's reasoning behind intensifying things through plotting you against overwhelming quantities is...refreshing. This is an excellent horror shooter, with the only flaws being its lack of enemy and weapon variety and its linearity.

You must roam the ravaged hulls of derelict space ships looking for a way to escape back home, before the hordes of necromorphs (zombie mutants, essentially) kill you. The unique (at the time) twist? The best way to kill any of these monsters is by dismembering them one limb (or two) at a time using your Plasma Cutter and other futuristic power tools! Lots of fun, good jump scares, and a serviceable plot all tie together into a really good time. Just be sure to turn Vsync on... or off.. I forget which, if your mouse controls are lagging. Just swap it to whatever it isn't set on already.\n\nIf you're considering buying the double pack with Dead Space 2, do it!

I initially thought it was just a modernized System Shock 2 ripoff. When I play it now I don't really see that. It's actually more Resident Evil 4 in space.\n\nYou play as Isaac Clark and you're sent with a bunch of engineers to repair this one space ship yadda yadda yadda insert Alien reference here. One thing I should mention about Dead Space is it's a very polished game. The graphics and engine still hold up relatively well, and the lack of heads up display is fairly immersive. The storyline leaves something to be desired but like every game in this genre it has good audio logs.\n\nAt the very least Dead Space still retains good value for money to this day, and if you enjoyed Resident Evil 4 this will appeal to you greatly.","August 15, 2013","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is not an amazing title by any means, but it gets the job done (barely).\n\nThe Good:\n- The atmosphere is definitely the selling point of Dead Space. It is executed perfectly and it really conveys the feeling of "Oh God... what happened to this place?"\n- The story is somewhere between ok to good depending on your perspective. I don't think it was an amazing story though.\n- Good characterization (minus the main character ironically).\n\nThe Bad:\n- The combat is relatively oversimplified. There is no crouching. There are no stealth mechanics. There is no "take the high ground for an advantage" type of feeling. Tactical fighting is not present in Dead Space. Your goal during encounters is to dismember your enemies by destroying their limbs instead of aiming for their torso or head. Enemies are "leashed" to rooms, so if you find yourself in a tough fight all you have to do is step through a door and they cannot follow you. This really trivializes the game as you can bypass many enemies this way.\n- The location of your health bar is for some reason attached to your character (Dead Space is third-person). While this  looks cool, it does not work well in combat. For example, if you are backed into a wall by a group of opponents, you can no longer see your health bar and you have no idea how much damage you have taken.\n- As a port to PC, the controls are not fluid. Turning and moving around is not completely smooth. I had to adjust the mouse sensitivity multiple times in certain areas because it was so difficult to move. Also, while using the Store Console, there is no mouse cursor present to select items you want to buy from the list. You cannot scroll through the list with your mouse wheel. You have to manually use the arrow keys to scroll and choose your items. How can something as simple as a mouse cursor for a list of items not get implemented?\n- I found it very strange that the character you play as (Isaac) never says a single word the entire game (literally, he says nothing). Other characters even stop to ask you questions and talk to you but Isaac never responds. I find it hard to connect with a mute character. Also I think it's very important to connect with the main character so you care about what happens to him/her, but with Isaac presenting zero personality or speech, it is very difficult to care about him.\n- Considering how unique the enemies are that you fight, I would have thought EA could have created some very cool boss fights or interesting mechanics. The boss fights though were massively disappointing and not interesting.\n\nOverall, Dead Space is carried by it's perfectly executed atmosphere and well-paced horror gameplay. The game is actually pretty good, but the unresponsive controls and a couple of poor UI choices are noticeably detrimental.\n\nAs a side note, the story (not the gameplay) of Dead Space and the way it unfolds is scary similar to System Shock 2 (probably 85% of the concept of Dead Space is the same concept as System Shock 2). System Shock 2 is a far superior game to Dead Space though in terms of both gameplay and story (I feel awful even using them in the same sentence).\n\nDead Space takes about 12-15 hours to complete.\n\n7/10\n\nPlease upvote this review if you found it useful :)","June 3, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game where you get disturbed. This game is, and perhaps will be for a long time, my favourite game series. Why?\n\nLet me start with a concise summary of the story.\nBasically what happened in the Dead Space universe, is that mankind is on the brink of extinction due to lack of resources on Earth. Desperately, humanity reaches for space and launches the biggest project involving planet crackers; huge spaceships with gravity tethers able to crack open planets in order to harvest it from useful resources under its surface. One of the planetcrackers has gotten into Aegis 7. The solar system has been marked as restricted and therefore the planet cracker USG Ishimora went on an illegal operation, as the planet might carry exceptionally portions of minerals and raw materials. A colony was established to maintain the mining operations. During these operations they discovered an alien artifact called "The Marker", a religious cult believe that it holds the key to humanity's redemption and a way to heaven. However, the project leaders of the mining operation were mostly interested in the Marker's ability to create infinite energy. Days after the discovery both the colony and Ishimura go dark. A small repair crew was dispatched to check the issue out. This is where you drop in, you experience the story behind the shoulder of Isaac Clarke (3rd person perspective), an engineer as part of the repair crew. You discover the disasterous and morbid events the Ishimura goes through as you try to escape the Ishimura, which is now filled with alien incarnated human corpses.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is absolutely amazing. They managed to keep you thrilled throughout the whole game by using variety of fear inducing events, a well-balanced range of space and room (from tight corridors to giant engine rooms), and audio (music, background, SFX). The story is appealed from the very beginning and still obsesses me this very day. A collection of unlockable weaponry, upgrades and armor keeps the game rewarding as well as video and audio logs, which reveal parts of the background and main story. The sequels of Dead Space (Dead Space Extraction, Dead Space 2, Dead Space 3, the Dead Space animes and so on) are wonderful as well, but the first game bears something unique. After your first playthrough you'll be filled with nostalgia, because your first experience of this game will be engraved in your soul.","June 30, 2013","true","53.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is very long, almost as long as it takes me to get the channel clicker to move to the next one.\n\nThis game seemed to cater well to Grandpa's growing Alzheimers, it seems to tell what is going on whenever.\n\nWhat was I talking about again?

The game doesn't really go for good scares, mostly just sudden "oh my god it's an alien coming straight for you suddenly have a loud noise" and they just got incredibly predictable after a while. But it can be quite creepy at times - probably helped absolutely humonguous amounts by the absolutely incredible sound design of this game. I think that this might the only time I max out one of the score categories for a game.\n\nSeriously, the sound design is just amazing. Incredible ambient noise, with really creepy nuances and fantastic utterly disgusting music for when you get under attack. Every single sound made is absolutely perfect.\n\nAlso the UI of this game is just amazing. Everything makes sense in the game world, it's all projected out of your suit or from screens on everything. It's fantastic, and it helps increase the tension because you can't pause the game by opening the map screen/inventory screen.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good, though I didn't feel it got tough enough on Normal difficulty so perhaps Hard difficulty is the right difficulty to play it on. The weapons are all satisfying to use, and can be very effective when upgraded correctly. I liked the way most of the enemies had weak points you could exploit to kill them quicker and conserve more ammo. The design of the aliens was fantastic, and the ship design was quite good (I liked how you had to revisit some levels for good reason, and some things had changed and that actually made it slightly creepy and foreboding).\n\nThe story wasn't particularly impressive, but a few bits of it were quite good. I was quite disappointed by the very end of the game though, like literally the last few seconds [if you've played it you'll know what I mean] because it just felt incredibly cheap.\n\nOther than that, this game was very good. A definite play, if not for the perfectly adequate gameplay then just for the mindblowingly incredible sound. Seriously, someone give the guy who did all that all the awards. Ever. All the awards.","December 16, 2013","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All of these films and many other great Sci Fi traditions act as a healthy source base for Dead Space. The game features a distress call, a seemingly silent ship which we quickly realize is dark and full of monsters. Something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nThe game's carefully crafted atmosphere and surprisingly good voice acting are really what draw you in. Although the plot is very transparent, and the character development (especially for Kendra) is a little weak, the game isn't really about that. It's about living out some version of the space horror fantasy you've had in your head ever since the first time you saw say, Event Horizon. The game has it all, spooky lighting, creepy cultists, a wide array of frightening monsters, and a slowing unfolding backstory involving a typical breakdown of the chain of command and descent into chaos.\n\nPlaying this game with headphones and in the dark, while alone, even a second time through, is quite an experience. Your heart will pound and you will jump out of your seat.\n\nGraphically speaking the game isn't much to look at, and the necromorphs aren't very inspired in their design, although they are scary. Nevertheless, the lighting and audio more than make up for the game's low resolution textures and low poly models.\n\nApart from really wonky object physics, the game feels very good to play as well. The slow turning speed of Isaac, your avatar, contributes to the sense of the game as being about horror/survival, and scavenging is essential. You aren't incredibly vulnerable, especially after upgrades, but you feel like you are, and that's what counts.\n\nUltimately, Dead Space is a surprising and fun guilty pleasure of a game that will remind you of nights spent watching sci-fi horror movies scaring yourself senseless in the dark.","December 31, 2013","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You must roam the ravaged hulls of derelict space ships looking for a way to escape back home, before the hordes of necromorphs (zombie mutants, essentially) kill you. The unique (at the time) twist? The best way to kill any of these monsters is by dismembering them one limb (or two) at a time using your Plasma Cutter and other futuristic power tools! Lots of fun, good jump scares, and a serviceable plot all tie together into a really good time. Just be sure to turn Vsync on... or off.. I forget which, if your mouse controls are lagging. Just swap it to whatever it isn't set on already.\n\nIf you're considering buying the double pack with Dead Space 2, do it!

Whispering voices in your head, Is anyone really alive or are you just imagining it?\n\nSeriously now, Dead space is a quality survival horror game, if you aren't careful your ammo will run dry and you'll be in big trouble, the jumpscares are there... but they're rare and far in between. The game changes pace in just the right places to keep you guessing what'll happen next. The story is simple, you crashed into the USG Ishimura and are trying to get back home. The characters you interact with are alright, some of them are there just to tell you what to do, then theres some that run the mad scientist trope, but all their lines are well written and the actors deliver with high credibility.

It is not an amazing title by any means, but it gets the job done (barely).\n\nThe Good:\n- The atmosphere is definitely the selling point of Dead Space. It is executed perfectly and it really conveys the feeling of "Oh God... what happened to this place?"\n- The story is somewhere between ok to good depending on your perspective. I don't think it was an amazing story though.\n- Good characterization (minus the main character ironically).\n\nThe Bad:\n- The combat is relatively oversimplified. There is no crouching. There are no stealth mechanics. There is no "take the high ground for an advantage" type of feeling. Tactical fighting is not present in Dead Space. Your goal during encounters is to dismember your enemies by destroying their limbs instead of aiming for their torso or head. Enemies are "leashed" to rooms, so if you find yourself in a tough fight all you have to do is step through a door and they cannot follow you. This really trivializes the game as you can bypass many enemies this way.\n- The location of your health bar is for some reason attached to your character (Dead Space is third-person). While this  looks cool, it does not work well in combat. For example, if you are backed into a wall by a group of opponents, you can no longer see your health bar and you have no idea how much damage you have taken.\n- As a port to PC, the controls are not fluid. Turning and moving around is not completely smooth. I had to adjust the mouse sensitivity multiple times in certain areas because it was so difficult to move. Also, while using the Store Console, there is no mouse cursor present to select items you want to buy from the list. You cannot scroll through the list with your mouse wheel. You have to manually use the arrow keys to scroll and choose your items. How can something as simple as a mouse cursor for a list of items not get implemented?\n- I found it very strange that the character you play as (Isaac) never says a single word the entire game (literally, he says nothing). Other characters even stop to ask you questions and talk to you but Isaac never responds. I find it hard to connect with a mute character. Also I think it's very important to connect with the main character so you care about what happens to him/her, but with Isaac presenting zero personality or speech, it is very difficult to care about him.\n- Considering how unique the enemies are that you fight, I would have thought EA could have created some very cool boss fights or interesting mechanics. The boss fights though were massively disappointing and not interesting.\n\nOverall, Dead Space is carried by it's perfectly executed atmosphere and well-paced horror gameplay. The game is actually pretty good, but the unresponsive controls and a couple of poor UI choices are noticeably detrimental.\n\nAs a side note, the story (not the gameplay) of Dead Space and the way it unfolds is scary similar to System Shock 2 (probably 85% of the concept of Dead Space is the same concept as System Shock 2). System Shock 2 is a far superior game to Dead Space though in terms of both gameplay and story (I feel awful even using them in the same sentence).\n\nDead Space takes about 12-15 hours to complete.\n\n7/10\n\nPlease upvote this review if you found it useful :)","June 3, 2014","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurolumiira/recommended/17470/","kurolumiira","Kuronii Lumiira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurolumiira/","196 products in account","In terms of horror these days, zombies seem to be a key mechanic in attempting to instill fear in the player. Naturally, with so many people harboring a fear of death and the unknown, a creature that comes back from the dead is a remarkably effective means of accomplishing and setting a fear-striking atmosphere. But with so many games applying this mechanic, it does tend to become broken and repetetive, leaving the recipient jaded and unamused.\n\nTo help add a new spice to the genre is Dead Space, a game whose name will take on numerous meanings throughout your playthrough. "What is this new spice?", you may ask. Simply put, it's the spice of a heavier science fiction attitude set in place by making the zombies into alien zombies. Where dark and stormy nights have succeeded in the past amongst the decaying ruins of a dilapidated house, or the whole of a city burning in the night as it dies, Dead Space attempts the same by replacing that all with rough static metal and the suffocating, inescapable reality of being marooned in space.\n\nAnd, it succeeds magnificently.\n\nNow, we're all in the horror genre because we enjoy the morbid, rushing thrill of being scared, or we've been press-ganged by our friend(s) into playing one of the games. If you're one of the latter, then godspeed. If you're one of the former, however, you're definitely in luck no matter what kind of thrill you seek. Dead Space presents a level of horror for each kind of player, ranging from the intense jump-scares to the underlying, bone-chillingly creepy logs written by crewpeople on the spaceship while the horror unfolded around them. To put it quite simply, Dead Space is a people-pleaser that performs its job exceptionally well; If you're playing the game for the quintissential fear factor, you'll definitely not be disappointed.\n\nBut why does it work so well? What exactly combines with and works well with the game's other parts to make it what it is?\n\nPart of it comes from the interesting graphical take it presents to the player. While most horror games are typically set in darkness, Dead Space tends to forego this in preference for, on the most part, a decently well-lit stage. Strangely enough, it works out as a whole. Since the player is so used to everything being visible, it's so much more shocking when you -are- thrust into darkness for a few moments, or when the lights go on the fritz and start flickering, adding to the uncertainty of exactly how safe the next room will be. Of course, the light is neccessary most of the time, because without it, we wouldn't be able to see the multitude of blood streaks spattered on the industrial metal bulwarks.\n\nAnother part of the atmosphere is built by the sounds. Now, we're all used to the ambient sounds in horror games: the whistling wind, the low groaning in the distance; Sadly, I've learnt to tune most of them out at this point. Dead Space has an interesting way of recapturing my attention. It decides to be silent a lot of the time. No atmospheric music. No orchestral cues except for when enemies pop out to attempt another throat-gouging. Pure silence. And it's legitimately unsettling to me. I'm used to music trying to set the stage for some heart-straining anxiety, but Dead Space won't give it to me, preferring to let me sweat it out on my own terms. It plays the same role as the lighting, really, so that it's shocking and powerful when it -does- change dramatically. Of course, it can't always play the same card, and toys around with ambient metallic scratching noises and, in one particular part, a deep lowing that rivals most other groans in the horror genre, making it truely chilling to hear.\n\nNaturally, flickering lights and distant sounds (or lack thereof) can't do it alone for the horror genre. Every good (and sometimes bad) horror game has a control scheme that is simple, yet just confining enough to make the player feel helpless in some ways. The early Resident Evil titles did this by making the most ridiculously convoluted camera angles to try and trip us up, and it worked. A lot of people who played it were enthralled by it, and tried over and over again to beat the game in its entirety. While not as extreme as Resident Evil, Dead Space's controls are just hampering enough to lend a feeling of desperation when it comes to traversing the tight, metal hallways, and to add salt to the wound, players are punished for trying to rush through most sections, so you're forced to take it slow and steady. Isaac Clarke's (the main character) movements are akin to the movements of driving a tank, though with the added benefit of feeling slightly as though you're being impeded by molasses. What I'm trying to say is that Isaac doesn't run very quickly, his aiming is relaxed at best, and the arm-flailing and foot stomping melee attacks feel as though Isaac is wearing some form of a suit of armor. And it all works out. The player really gets the feeling that Isaac isn't a war-hardened army veteran or a muscle-bound powerhouse, but instead just a regular joe who was sucked into the whole, nasty event against his will.\n\nHowever, above all that comprises the game, the unlock feature helps to drive the playablity of the game. Beat the storyline once and you get access to harder difficulty levels more items to use in-game with a nifty "new game plus" feature. Because, while it's certainly enjoyable playing it over to feel more capable, and, in some circumstances, like an absolute god, it's refreshing to be punished heavily for breathing improperly in "Impossible" difficulty.\n\nSo, to sum it up, Dead Space is there to gouge your eyes out, disembowel you, and beat you to death with your own limbs, and all the while, you're being urged to do the same to it. And you'll enjoy every second of it. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone wanting to get into the horror genre, and to anyone already in the genre who wants something new. I'll recommend it to everyone else as well, since no one should be left out.\n\nSleep with your lights on.\n\n~Kuro","March 11, 2014","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is scary... if dead bodies scare you. I mean, ..sure there are moments where I jumped a bit, but..scary is ..giving it too much credit.

Good gameplay, good story, good characters, great environments. Even good puzzles / level design.\n\nWhat's wrong is that... its not scary, its just incredibly gore intensive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurolumiira/recommended/17470/","kurolumiira","Kuronii Lumiira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kurolumiira/","196 products in account","In terms of horror these days, zombies seem to be a key mechanic in attempting to instill fear in the player. Naturally, with so many people harboring a fear of death and the unknown, a creature that comes back from the dead is a remarkably effective means of accomplishing and setting a fear-striking atmosphere. But with so many games applying this mechanic, it does tend to become broken and repetetive, leaving the recipient jaded and unamused.\n\nTo help add a new spice to the genre is Dead Space, a game whose name will take on numerous meanings throughout your playthrough. "What is this new spice?", you may ask. Simply put, it's the spice of a heavier science fiction attitude set in place by making the zombies into alien zombies. Where dark and stormy nights have succeeded in the past amongst the decaying ruins of a dilapidated house, or the whole of a city burning in the night as it dies, Dead Space attempts the same by replacing that all with rough static metal and the suffocating, inescapable reality of being marooned in space.\n\nAnd, it succeeds magnificently.\n\nNow, we're all in the horror genre because we enjoy the morbid, rushing thrill of being scared, or we've been press-ganged by our friend(s) into playing one of the games. If you're one of the latter, then godspeed. If you're one of the former, however, you're definitely in luck no matter what kind of thrill you seek. Dead Space presents a level of horror for each kind of player, ranging from the intense jump-scares to the underlying, bone-chillingly creepy logs written by crewpeople on the spaceship while the horror unfolded around them. To put it quite simply, Dead Space is a people-pleaser that performs its job exceptionally well; If you're playing the game for the quintissential fear factor, you'll definitely not be disappointed.\n\nBut why does it work so well? What exactly combines with and works well with the game's other parts to make it what it is?\n\nPart of it comes from the interesting graphical take it presents to the player. While most horror games are typically set in darkness, Dead Space tends to forego this in preference for, on the most part, a decently well-lit stage. Strangely enough, it works out as a whole. Since the player is so used to everything being visible, it's so much more shocking when you -are- thrust into darkness for a few moments, or when the lights go on the fritz and start flickering, adding to the uncertainty of exactly how safe the next room will be. Of course, the light is neccessary most of the time, because without it, we wouldn't be able to see the multitude of blood streaks spattered on the industrial metal bulwarks.\n\nAnother part of the atmosphere is built by the sounds. Now, we're all used to the ambient sounds in horror games: the whistling wind, the low groaning in the distance; Sadly, I've learnt to tune most of them out at this point. Dead Space has an interesting way of recapturing my attention. It decides to be silent a lot of the time. No atmospheric music. No orchestral cues except for when enemies pop out to attempt another throat-gouging. Pure silence. And it's legitimately unsettling to me. I'm used to music trying to set the stage for some heart-straining anxiety, but Dead Space won't give it to me, preferring to let me sweat it out on my own terms. It plays the same role as the lighting, really, so that it's shocking and powerful when it -does- change dramatically. Of course, it can't always play the same card, and toys around with ambient metallic scratching noises and, in one particular part, a deep lowing that rivals most other groans in the horror genre, making it truely chilling to hear.\n\nNaturally, flickering lights and distant sounds (or lack thereof) can't do it alone for the horror genre. Every good (and sometimes bad) horror game has a control scheme that is simple, yet just confining enough to make the player feel helpless in some ways. The early Resident Evil titles did this by making the most ridiculously convoluted camera angles to try and trip us up, and it worked. A lot of people who played it were enthralled by it, and tried over and over again to beat the game in its entirety. While not as extreme as Resident Evil, Dead Space's controls are just hampering enough to lend a feeling of desperation when it comes to traversing the tight, metal hallways, and to add salt to the wound, players are punished for trying to rush through most sections, so you're forced to take it slow and steady. Isaac Clarke's (the main character) movements are akin to the movements of driving a tank, though with the added benefit of feeling slightly as though you're being impeded by molasses. What I'm trying to say is that Isaac doesn't run very quickly, his aiming is relaxed at best, and the arm-flailing and foot stomping melee attacks feel as though Isaac is wearing some form of a suit of armor. And it all works out. The player really gets the feeling that Isaac isn't a war-hardened army veteran or a muscle-bound powerhouse, but instead just a regular joe who was sucked into the whole, nasty event against his will.\n\nHowever, above all that comprises the game, the unlock feature helps to drive the playablity of the game. Beat the storyline once and you get access to harder difficulty levels more items to use in-game with a nifty "new game plus" feature. Because, while it's certainly enjoyable playing it over to feel more capable, and, in some circumstances, like an absolute god, it's refreshing to be punished heavily for breathing improperly in "Impossible" difficulty.\n\nSo, to sum it up, Dead Space is there to gouge your eyes out, disembowel you, and beat you to death with your own limbs, and all the while, you're being urged to do the same to it. And you'll enjoy every second of it. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone wanting to get into the horror genre, and to anyone already in the genre who wants something new. I'll recommend it to everyone else as well, since no one should be left out.\n\nSleep with your lights on.\n\n~Kuro","March 11, 2014","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

You get that feeling of horror for your protagonist practically everywhere you go because you're not exactly certain what to expect next.

Especially since you are isolated from the small crew you arrived with for the majority of the time. You will encounter torrid creatures that threaten the lives of you and your crew. You will be seperated from comforting human contact or support for substantial lengths of time. Your mission will take you to a massive mining vessel whose crew of roughly thirteen-hundred strong has "disappeared".\n\nFirst and foremost, you must survive using problems solving techniques and careful application of defensive resources. If you succeed, you will uncover the truth as to what happened on the mining vessel and the events that transpired before the collapse.\n\nThis title is now on my recurring list of games to play as the years go by, and I'm quite certain the sequels will be as well.","November 6, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoy finding the audio/video logs that explain the lore even further. The game does a good job pacing itself and I am always intrigued to find out what will happen next to the characters and how it will turn out in the end. The game itself really isn't all that scary, just with some cheap jumpscares and all, but is rather creepy and eerie.

Great gameplay, great story, great atmosphere, great level design. Nails the sci-fi + horror setting. The whole series is great, although they veered more and more toward action with each sequel (which I can forgive because you will be so good at shooting off alien limbs by the time you finish 1 & 2 that more of the same in 3 would not have been much challenge).","June 24, 2015","true","30.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember when I first bought the game for 360 and I knew nothing about the game. The first play through was fantastic and the enviroment is chilling and makes you feel uneasy. I can say that the first time you play through you will have some moments where you tense up from jump scares and the unexpected, but you will get use to it. Even so, the game is one the best horror/survival games I've played in my many years of gaming and pretty scary in my opinion.

The atmosphere this title manages to evoke is amongst some of the best I've ever come across in my 20-year gaming career. If you're a fan of The Thing, Event Horizon, Alien, anything along those lines, you will *relish* the game's mixture of music, storytelling and pace. The fact that I've just finished my god-knows-how-many-th run through here in 2015 having thoroughly enjoyed every minute really underlines how well the devs did.\n\nThe game does like it's share of jump scares but I found it didn't overdo them - rather than go down Doom 3's route of continuously letting loose horrors from hidden cabinets, half the time the game lets your own head do it's work for you - you'll glimpse things rushing down corridors, you'll hear whispers in the dark without any clear source, every so often something will clang and crash. It's classic horror stuff of messing with your head to make the reveal all the better. The game drip-feeds it's story by way of audio logs, footage, and gradual exposition across what used to be a place where it's crew worked and lived, as you slowly learn what the f*** happened on this doomed ship, and the excellent voice acting really pushes the script in the right direction.\n\nTechnically, it's a fairly standard third-person shooter - much of the ruckus about how your character is an average blue-collar Parker-from-Alien engineer thrown into a nightmarish ghost ship crawling with horrific entities is fairly thin, as your 'improvised engineering tools' can be turned into shockingly devastating instruments of destruction (quite what a miner needs a giant particle cannon for is explained as, um, shooting rocks... yeah, makes you wonder how fast and ferocious rocks are in the future) but none of that is really important - expect a gameplay pace sitting somewhere between Mass Effect 1 and Gears of War with *very* rough narrative outline and atmosphere similar to System Shock 2. Intially playing like a Survival Horror, padding down corridors with a palpable feeling that you are only alive by sheer luck with precious little kit, the game steadily becomes more and more action-packed with Isaac the Engineer undergoing some serious nerd rage, upgrading his contraptions to fight ever more gross and numerous monsters that take leaves out of pretty much every sci-fi horror of the last 20 years.\n\nBut don't play this for the simple gameplay, as entertaining as it is. Play it to enjoy a truly awesome sci-fi horror and wish that the gaming industry produced half as much as this stuff as it did CoD clones.\n\nThen play it's sequel. Like me. :D","November 17, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can also strategically shoot off body parts of aliens to damage them more, allowing you to conserve ammo.\n\nThe graphics and sounds are good. The story is decent enough, though story was never a forte in this game genre.\n\nThe con is that there are too many moments where aliens suddenly appear in your face, scaring you through sudden shock.

Unlike the previous 2 games, you can actually buy items such as ammo from stores which are located throughout the game. You can also strategically shoot off body parts of aliens to damage them more, allowing you to conserve ammo.\n\nThe graphics and sounds are good. The story is decent enough, though story was never a forte in this game genre.\n\nThe con is that there are too many moments where aliens suddenly appear in your face, scaring you through sudden shock. So if you have a heart condition, do not get this game.

The atmosphere this title manages to evoke is amongst some of the best I've ever come across in my 20-year gaming career. If you're a fan of The Thing, Event Horizon, Alien, anything along those lines, you will *relish* the game's mixture of music, storytelling and pace. The fact that I've just finished my god-knows-how-many-th run through here in 2015 having thoroughly enjoyed every minute really underlines how well the devs did.\n\nThe game does like it's share of jump scares but I found it didn't overdo them - rather than go down Doom 3's route of continuously letting loose horrors from hidden cabinets, half the time the game lets your own head do it's work for you - you'll glimpse things rushing down corridors, you'll hear whispers in the dark without any clear source, every so often something will clang and crash. It's classic horror stuff of messing with your head to make the reveal all the better. The game drip-feeds it's story by way of audio logs, footage, and gradual exposition across what used to be a place where it's crew worked and lived, as you slowly learn what the f*** happened on this doomed ship, and the excellent voice acting really pushes the script in the right direction.\n\nTechnically, it's a fairly standard third-person shooter - much of the ruckus about how your character is an average blue-collar Parker-from-Alien engineer thrown into a nightmarish ghost ship crawling with horrific entities is fairly thin, as your 'improvised engineering tools' can be turned into shockingly devastating instruments of destruction (quite what a miner needs a giant particle cannon for is explained as, um, shooting rocks... yeah, makes you wonder how fast and ferocious rocks are in the future) but none of that is really important - expect a gameplay pace sitting somewhere between Mass Effect 1 and Gears of War with *very* rough narrative outline and atmosphere similar to System Shock 2. Intially playing like a Survival Horror, padding down corridors with a palpable feeling that you are only alive by sheer luck with precious little kit, the game steadily becomes more and more action-packed with Isaac the Engineer undergoing some serious nerd rage, upgrading his contraptions to fight ever more gross and numerous monsters that take leaves out of pretty much every sci-fi horror of the last 20 years.\n\nBut don't play this for the simple gameplay, as entertaining as it is. Play it to enjoy a truly awesome sci-fi horror and wish that the gaming industry produced half as much as this stuff as it did CoD clones.\n\nThen play it's sequel. Like me. :D","November 17, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, it's not that easy to get spooked for me.\n\nThis game can make your heart race and then it rips it out! It is worth every dollar you pay for it. I fully recommend it.\n\nIf you like games that have great story, very innovative and non-linearly behaving enemies that will surprise you sneaking around to get to you. When you like shooting scary, disgusting, mutated monstrosities coming at you and not being able to just "shoot them up" in a blind rage - but having to precisely target them. And each enemy needs a different tactic + you need to utilize your choice of 4 guns throughout the game to the fullest - then this is a game for you. It also has some really cool - and usually interrupted by tons of enemies... logical puzzles to solve tho most of them aren't that tough to crack.\n\nI rarely have time to play these days. But this game was a beautiful - PTSD inducing experience to me, so I consider it time well spent. Yes, it was so good I was ending some sessions of it in sweat and tired as after a workout. It was soo scary that at times I was just telling myself "It's ok... just skip it for tonight... will help you sleep better".\n\nI repeat - this is a great game!\n\nTip:\n2 things you might want to keep in mind, since I realized them very late in the game and wish someone told me.\n\n1 - Telekinesis... you can not only pull and swing and hold objects. But if you press fire button while holding something - you can shoot it forward.\n2 - Green item boxes - YES you CAN open those. By stomping on them (sometimes there's enemy inside, but rare). So keep that in mind esp when you're playing on Hard. I did and realized it only at second to last chapter...","January 27","true","54.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another good idea is the guidance indicator that shows the way to your next objective in the convoluted bowels of the USG Ishimura thus avoiding artifical lenghtening of play time.\nAlthough for some players the game seems to have problems the only noticeable bug I experienced was a clipping error in the end fight.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/david0vic/recommended/17470/","david0vic","David0vić","http://steamcommunity.com/id/david0vic/","170 products in account","I really feel like this game must be played on hard difficulty because medium just feels like a casual third person shooter, you get tons of ammo and the necromorphs are easy to kill. Hard genuinely feels like a survival horror game. The monsters feel like a real threat because they are challenging and you have to conserve your ammo which creates alot of tension during the fights. I don't think the game is scary at all however. The atmosphere and setting is great but the scares themselves i didn't find effective at all.\nI can think of two reasons why the scares don't work, guns and third person. When an enemy jumps out you have a way of defending yourself by shooting them so that vulnerability factor is lessened because of that. This is why games like amnesia and outlast work so well at being scary because you have no way of defending yourself. Even a game like Fear works so well, even though its a first person shooter the scares are supernatural and unkillable which is what makes it so effective. Because the game is in third person the monsters don't jump out in your face like they would in first person. The scares are at a distance from you because you are positioned behind the character you are playing. I don't think the game needs to be scary to work though it's still a great game because of its amazing atmosphere and sound effects and the game is just fun to play.\n8/10 (Great)","February 25","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/recommended/17470/","bohlingc","Kahless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/","322 products in account","Highly recommended if you're willing to put up with a wonky port. Vsync locks the game to 30 fps, but running over 60 fps results in gamebreaking bugs. You might be able to fix that by forcing Vsync in your video card control panel, but I have a 144Hz monitor and it didn't work for me, even when I set my monitor to 60Hz.\n\nAlso, there is awful negative mouse acceleration that makes playing this game with M+K really difficult. Some people have reported that locking to 60 fps fixes that too, but as with the bugs it didn't work for me. So, I ended up playing this game in "console mode" at 30 fps with a controller. That was actually OK, as good frame pacing and tactfully implemented motion blur make 30 fps totally fine in this game, and the shooting is not awful with a controller since it's relatively short-range and imprecise.\n\nAnyway, if you're not familiar with Dead Space, it's a survival-action horror-ish game where you have to dismember your enemies by cutting off their limbs rather than shooting them in the head or the body. The combat is excellent and very weighty and visceral. You have to cut, stomp, and bludgeon your enemies to death with engineering tools rather than shoot them run-and-gun style like in many shooter games. You also get to scavenge for ammo, health packs, and power nodes to help upgrade your armor and ammo. It's got a resource management component, but I didn't find that keeping my ammo well-stocked was all that hard.\n\nIt takes place on a mining starship where the crew have all been infected with an alien parasite that transforms them into the limb-swinging monsters you have to fight. There's a lot more backstory, of course, but to reveal it would be to spoil the fun of uncovering what happened. You learn about the story from clues in the environment itself, rather it's text notes or messages scrawled in blood on the wall. There aren't too many jumpscares - the game is more gory than scary.\n\nThe level design is linear but gives you just enough freedom to make you feel like you're in a real place and not a corridor. It's clearly dated graphically, but the design aesthetic of the game is consistent and compelling - this is a game world that's fun to look at and explore, even though it's full of gore.\nOverall, definitely worth a look if you're one of the 2 people who haven't played it yet, but be aware of the PC port issues before buying.","December 1, 2015","true","21.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls for the PC version of this otherwise good game are the worst I have ever encountered. I won’t go into detail but they’re so awkward they almost spoiled the game for me. Almost. (There are also some truly annoying problems with camera and viewpoint angles, but don’t get me started on that!) But what about the good? DEAD SPACE succeeds, despite the aforementioned problems, mainly because it oozes atmosphere. This is a very claustrophobic game that sucks you in and really does induce anxiety. You will jump many times, trust me. The story is okay, within the usual limitations of such games, the voice acting is uniformly convincing, and the graphics are good but not outstanding. Where this game excels is in the way it draws you in; immerses you in it’s dark atmosphere.

I wasn't really sure what to think of it when I bought it shortly after it came out. This series has become one of my all time video game favorites, and I have been playing video games for almost 25 years now.\n\nTips to enjoy:\n1.) Turn out lights.\n2.) Play at night.\n3.) Be the only one home and expose your back to a large dark room.\n4.) Get headphones with surround sound\n5.) Enjoy peeing in your pants and jumping at shadows.\n\n\nSeriously, this game is morbid, dark, twisted, and tons of fun. I keep going back for more.\n\nThe game may be old (2008ish), but is still lots of fun. Everything is done in 3rd person. This mean all interfaces, inventory screen, video/audio/text logs, maps, etc are shown in 3rd person at anytime where you can be attacked from mosters. The controls may seem unresponsive at first but it quickly adds to the game machanics and atmosphere and don't really become a burden. The lighting and sound design is spot on. That is where this game really, really shines. This game may not have the greatest graphics, but you couldn't ask for better lighting placement or sound effects. The game does mix things up and it never overuses a game concept which does add for atleast a second playthrough. Each enviroment feels different yet somehow familiar but you never get that feeling of "been there, done that."\n\nThe dismemberment mechanic (where the best way to kill something is to shoot its limbs off), the 3rd person everything, the lighting and sound design, the level design, the "Zero G' and vacuum machanic, the pacing of the game, and the general atmosphere of the game makes it unique and one not to be missed. This is one that you will remember for several years and probably pick up to play after a couple years and still find it fun.\n\nThis game is NOT to be missed.","March 27, 2014","true","70.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a Third Person Shooter, with an emphasis on aiming for the limbs of enemies rather than the body itself or the head. It is scary, but it's mostly just suspense, although very gruesome. This game's UI (User Interface) takes place as bars on the back of your suit (easy to see though), and windows are "2.5D" and they're on the world rather than on your HUD.\nWarning: If you are not okay with scary games, or you have a weak stomach, or you simply dislike gore, this game is likely not for you.\n\nThe game has a very deep storyline, centering on a "Maintenance Mission" over at a wrecked spaceship, overrun by alien lifeforms which turned the spaceship's crew into mutants.\n\nAs for gameplay, you are given "cutting" weapons, with a sort of laser sights so you can see the cutting area, and you have to aim at body parts like the shoulders, arms, hands, legs... Some enemies have other "parts". You need to learn how to kill each and every enemy efficiently in order to conserve ammo and health, as items are limited in this game. In this game there is also zero gravity areas where you'll be able to move around more freely (but not float around), and stand on most walls you see. Some areas have no oxygen, and your Air meter will run down per second, until you reach an area with oxygen. You are also able to use "Stasis", used for slowing down objects and enemies, giving you a better chance at doing certain things, especially saving ammo.\nAlmost everything is upgradeable, including your HP, Air meter, Stasis, the damage/capacity/reload/speed of your weapons, Etc. This is done by consuming Power Nodes at an Upgrade Bench. You can buy those at stores, finding them around the ship, or receive them for killing powerful enemies.\n\nIf you decide to play on Hard Mode, this is where the game truly shines. You'll need to be very careful on how you use your weapons, and you need to be aware of your surroundings. Items are used up quicker on Hard Mode, and you might see yourself going around with low HP often. I myself reccommend to play on Hard Mode, since this is a not-so-short game and Hard Mode makes it even longer and more interesting.\n\nStability wise, this game isn't so good for that. It is rather old, but not too old, and normally plays well on most computers. There is, unfortunately, a "mouse lag" glitch, where aiming will never actually be smooth. It's easy to overcome this glitch though, and keep playing on while ignoring it.\nTip: Disable V-Sync (Vertical Sync) on the in-game video options before you start playing, as it will only cause a lot of trouble and it'll increase the mouse lag further if left enabled.\n\nReplayability is okay, but the game is always interesting and fun no matter what.\n\nTL;DR: Really nice semi-scary game, lots of gore, very immersive and promotes aiming strategically. My rating is 9/10, almost the best game I've ever played.","June 12, 2014","true","40.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is brutal, bloody, and as hard as asteroid debris.\nPros:\n+ Gore. You get a sense of dread in your stomach watching severed body segments float in zero gravity.\n+ Challenging. You will die several times. Several times. You really have to want to beat this game to get to the end.\n+ Long. It took me more than 17 hours to get through this game on medium, and that's pretty impressive for a game of this type.\n+ Stage design is immaculate. Your objectives in each section are varied, tie in nicely with the story, and the game looks great on a nice rig.\n+ The “Ripper” weapon is pure, unbridled joy.\n\nCons:\n- The load screen makes you wait. If you try to minimize the screen and go do something else, it will still make you wait when you pull it back up. At least a third of the time you play this game you will be staring at the load screen. Ah, so this is how they meant to artificially extend playtime.\n- Frustrating controls and camera angles. Why must I watch from his shoulder like a parrot? Oh, you didn't mean to hit that button? Sucks to be you. Hope you like staring at load screens.\n- The protagonist is mute. When he gets ripped to shreds by Necromorphs, it's gross, but I feel no sense of connection to the hero.\n- The asteroid-shooting mini-game is pure tedium.\n\nPro/Cons:\n+/- The upgrade system is appreciated, but the changes you make to your gear don't always seem that significant.\n+/- There is no cooperative mode, but then being the only person accomplishing tasks ramps up the tension.\n+/- Objectives can be vague and will make you consult online guides, but then, this game doesn't always hold your hand. The stages aren't as linear as they are in the 2nd and 3rd installments, where you're carted along one path like a theme park ride.\n\nSummary: This game is more than just Resident Evil in space. “Dead Space” does survival horror better. There is just a perfect amount of ammunition and supplies to keep you on the edge of your seat, amazing sequences, machines, and scenery, and it doesn't blatantly coddle the player. It qualifies as a classic.\n\nWho should buy this game:\n*Mature gamers that want a real survival horror challenge.\n*Horror aficionados who feel that most games aren't gory enough.\n\nWho should avoid this game:\n*Gamers who want something to play with friends.\n*Squeamish people that are upset by monstrous sounds, blood, and dead bodies.\n\nI give it an 8.9 out of 10.","January 18, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Dead Space is a BEAUTIFULLY made Horror FPS like no other. The series is packed full of gore, excitement, thrills and twists that will leave you to find yourself letting that pizza you just ordered get cold as you lean closer and closer towards your screen getting sucked into the nightmare that is Dead Space.\n\nThe game takes place where the Animation Movie leaves off, and it has a wonderfully executed story line that will grasp your attention and interest. The cutscene are awesome and the death scene are even more spectacular. If you happen to play this game it is at least worth dying once and sometimes twice to every enemy type as the cinematic death cutscenes definitely go unrivalled. The game is also inredibly fun playing it multiple ways. My personal favorite is to beat it on hardest difficulty with only the starting plasma cutter. I have completed 1,2 on hardest that way and 51.4% through 3 on impossible which is ludacris and might very well be close to impossible if not impossible.

I've played my share of Survival Horror (starting with the granddaddy of them all, Alone in the Dark), but there's just something about Dead Space that's truly terrifying - the same reason Amnesia still sits on my digital shelf collecting digital cobwebs.\n\nBut then the backlog starts piling, and a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. I finished Dead Space, and that should count as something when I get to Purgatory. The worry of absolute terror never ended - that's really something considering the game clocks in about 12 hours; and most survival horror/action games usually lose the terror after a few hours of collecting heavy weaponry. I was hooked with the atmoshpere and story that borrows a lot from scifi horror greats, but somehow puts its own stamp of uniqueness on what it steals.\n\nSpeaking of uniqueness, there's a lot of it in Dead Space. The gameplay twist that enemies go down easier by shooting off their limbs instead of the head sounds wonky in the beginning, but a few encounters with the necromorphs made me a believer. It's perfect because arms and legs tend to move more erraticly than one's head, which adds to the tension when aiming. Also, as a result, probably the most unique weapons I've handled in a game were created for this Dead Space. The cutter, the linegun, the ripper, all have their special use when it comes to dismemberment, with just the right amount of frustration to give them character - give them a sense that these are real tools.\n\nAnother thing to note is the game's inventory system. Very much like Resident Evil's limited slot-based  inventory, complete with external storage nodes that transfer excess baggage from one spot to another, Dead Space ups the ante by adding money to the mix. This actually made inventory management fun instead of frustrating, as I was figuring out how much of which ammo I should have, I should sell in exchange for Power Nodes (basically upgrade points). It became a mini game in itself. I'd be sad to hear if this lead to the adoption of microtransactions in Dead Space 3, but for this humble begging, it's very much welcome. (It also helps that plot items have their own inventory space, so need to worry about not having a crucial item when you need it).\n\nThat's Dead Space in a nutshell. A rancid, mutating death nutshell. I'm still getting that same sense of thrill/dread about sampling the next two installments, so maybe I'll give the other gut-friendlier dishes in my buffet a try for the time being.","January 24, 2014","true","14.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Trust me, it doesn't kick in until you restart your PC\n\nStep 2: Also Click on this link, again, it's another Steam Guide but this one helps to fix the terribly low and awful mouse controls that the game has on default, trust me, its a very serious issue - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=232050455\n\nStep 3: There's no step 3 because that number is not in the Steam text unicode of this user review client...jk moving on, MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF V-SYNC\n\nStep 4: *SPOILERS BUT I NEED TO TELL YOU* So there's a part in the very beginning of the game where you are going to come across what is infamously known as the "Invisible-Wall-Bug-Of-The-Dead-Space-PC-Port". This invisible wall bug is found right in the beginning of the game in the first chapter where you first recieve the plasma cutter right after you exit the elevator unarmed from the slasher necromorphs chasing you. This room has a wall that says "cut off the limbs" and has a guy screaming behind a door, if you were to continue your journey that exact door that dude is behind will not let you pass, seriously, it's a stupid glitch but theres many stupid glitches in this game that shouldn't be in there. So this is what you are going to do, I recommend you save your game before hand in the first save station to do this. Once you reach the first elevator and you are in it quickly go to your options menu and turn on V-Sync, you may have to deal with terrible framerate and mouse controls but once you make it pass that door you can turn it off and continue your survival through the USG Ishimura. (If this doesn't work then try to find a way to decrease your framerate under 30 fps, the game is capped at 30 anyway, I heard Fraps helps with this under the same process I specified).\n\n\n\nSoooo yeah, now that that's out of the way, lets get on to the review shall we?\n\n\nReview\nSo excluding the atrocious PC port Dead Space is a fantastic and immersive horror experience. Now I got to be frank with you, I pretty much spoiled Dead Space when I saw a let's play from like 3-5 years ago yet my memory was very vague when I played this game. To tell you what's going on in the story I recommend you play it for yourself because duh spoilers, that plus other people who give reviews will tell tend to explain the story, mine is more of the experience.\n\nBesides spoiling the game for myself I have also played Dead Space 2 and completed it (On the Xbox 360) and have got to say that the experience was very unique compared to if I played Dead Space 1 first and then 2. You know that feeling when you look at a picture of a famous monument and actually went there? Or go and experience that one place that's so talked about and then actually visit it? Well that's what Dead Space 1 was like when I played it, so much of the trilogy's plot all revolves around the events of what happened on the USG Ishimura and the planet Aegis 7 along with the developement of the main protagonist Isaac Clarke, that plus the event's of the USG Ishimura acts as a catalyst for pretty much the entire 3 game's story.\n\nAs a survival horror game Dead Space does it pretty well even though the gameplay mechanics are straight up Resident Evil 4 just with new stuff that you can do. Now yes as much of the Dead Space community has stated Dead Space 1 is a lot more scarier than is Dead Space 2 for many reasons. Now I'm pretty tough when it comes to scary games yet Dead Space still tends to frighten me compared to the jump scare infested and cinematic sequel that was Dead Space 2. The game kept my heart at an above than normal pulse in certain parts and some parts have truly made my heart race.\n\nThe Immersion in Dead Space is incredible with the sound design being spot on along with the game's mechanics and setting working together to make the immersive experience amazing, here's how it works: Dead Space's indicators is all attached to the character's body such as the character's "RIG" stating the player's health along with the Stasis meter being on the character's RIG aswell, The game's mechanics such as the Stasis ability and Kinesis ability are all integrated uses in the game's setting, story, and lore, not some thing tacked on for just gameplay purposes. For example the use of stasis and kinesis are actual tools used by the USG Ishimura's crew along with the weapons of the game being mechanical power tools used on the ship (excluding the Pulse Rifle of course). The sound design is spot on and it all makes sense and adds to the game, you will hear distant screams of unlucky survivors and necromophs alike that will make you wonder if there were any other survivors still on the ship through out your journey, you will hear clanks and sounds in the vents and in the distance that make you tense thinking that a necromorph can come out of any vent at any time possible.\n\nDead Space's story is very interesting and many of the concept's of the game are ones that I have never seen in anything before, sure the game take's influences from franchises such as Alien along with how the premise of the game has already been done by titles such as System Shock 2. Besides that I think the game is very original for its time and I think anyone should do some research on the lore because the setting of Dead Space with planet cracking, the Marker, necromorphs and the Church of Unitology is one that I find interesting.\n\nThe Bad n' Ugry\nThe port for Dead Space on PC is atrocious, not for the fact that it has issues but by the fact that it's bugs are absolutely pathetic, like really, some of the bugs in this game make Call of Duty: Ghost's PC port look good, I mean here's a list of the bugs that I've encountered:\n\n1. The game doesn't even try to run on AMD alone\n2. Stupid invisible door glitch in the beginning\n3. Broken physics and highly sensitive hitboxs for non-static objects that cause things such as corpes and dead body parts to flail around when you give a slight love tap to them (chapter 2 body bag dance party lel)\n4. Player model/Isaac Clarke tends to spaz out when you sprint on some parts of the ground\n5. Finicky mouse controls with horribly low sensitivity even on the highest setting\n6. Some wierd thing that happens to a tram door that gets stuck mid animation that causes you from passing\n7. Characters that die tend to spaz out when they go from static character to ragdoll (hilarious and somewhat immersive breaking)\n8. (MY ABSOLUTE HATED) So there will be parts where you will have to float in space and there is a slight chance that your character make freeze via clipping into geometry and just die as if Isaac sufficated from I don't know, polygons? This happened to me like 3 times and 2 were by the end of the game\n\nBut hey that doesn't mean it's a bad game! So go out and buy it and have a good ol' time!","August 9, 2015","true","23.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In this game, players step into the role of Isaac Clarke ― a ship systems engineer whose journey starts on a seemingly routine mission to fix the communication systems on the planet cracker.\n\nIt is not long until he realizes that he stepped into a living nightmare of vicious alien creatures and a dead silence ship where he must constantly fight to get out alive.\n\nThe story in Dead Space is one of its strongest points. Most of it is told via video, audio and text diaries you find scattered around the ship. Another strong point is the atmosphere, a lot of it due to brilliant sound effects. It's a very impressive looking game overall, though sometimes you will feel like you are going through the same corridors over and over again. The combat is also good. Some sections may look a bit repetitive, however, the strategic dismemberment and the stomping are just extremely fun and satisfying.\n\nBeing a fan of the survival horror and sci-fi genres, I played this game myself and have watched other people play it, and it simply does not get boring. It does stop being truly scary after the first few hours but jump scares are always around the corner.","May 2, 2015","true","12.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'm not a big fan of jumpscares as I feel them being a cheap way to enthrill. Then again I've played this game through 3 times and the reason for that is that this game has a very good gameplay. It has some mediocre issues in storytelling and atmosphere that prevents this being an outstanding game. Instead, this is just good.\n\nI have played all parts of the series, except third installement is still uncompleted. Then again the third one didn't seem to have anything to do with the first one so I though I might as well review this now.\n\nThe plot of the game is pretty generic. In space no one can hear you scream. Weird monsters invade space ship and the protagonist must fight back after their immediate escape possibilities are cut down. Plot starts immediately and isn't very surprising at any point. Player travels back and forth in the ship doing stuff while other characters in the game stand still and cry. Kendra Daniels is one of the most annoying side characters I've so far seen or heard in a game.\n\nThe part where this game excels is that it makes the playing part fun, although the plot is uninsteresting. By giving the possibility to cut limbs instead of just shooting aliens, this game makes the fights somewhat more interesting and more pleasing. In a fight with multiple enemies, one can shoot their legs off before move to finishing them with another weapon. Also by making playable character a walker instead of a runner, the game is much better paced than some other horror games. Sure he can run, but he cannot shoot while running and running usually ends in a situation where a necromorph is close enough to hug Isaac.\n\nThen again even though the pacing excels, this is yet another example where I think the game could've used a real director(like movies have). Though the game tries to be a horror game, it rarely excels in it. Most of the enemies are given away by loud roars or sudden violin sounds. Basically player just turns to where ever the sound came and shoots. Some jump scares are not enough to call it a horror game. It's a jump-scare-game. I'm not afraid of jumpscare, I just don't like them, like sewage. The game loses a lot of atmosphere by doing this. Games scaries part are the vacuum scenarios where no sound is played, so one must stay alert all the time for the enemy. Also there are occasionally so many enemies that I felt like playing a shooter instead of atmospheric horro game.\n\nThe game is really cheap today(2,5eur in sales) so no hurt trying. Easiest difficulty setting is enough to take any challenge out of the game if one feels like going it just for the story, although some atmosphere is lost by doing this.\n\nTo anyone suffering mouse problems, try V-sync out and force v-sync from video driver software or utilities like radeonpro. Also playable without v-sync but some say they've had problems related to one door not opening. Also playing without any kind of vsync might cause coil whine in gpu with FPS running over 200 with better cards(2012 enthusiast ->)\n\nI recommend this game as a nice way to pass 8-10 hours, but don't expect anything great out of it. It's solid and it's good enough to give it a try. If you don't like it, don't buy the next installements either, they give nothing more.","March 28, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KevinJRattman/recommended/17470/","KevinJRattman","¤ PLX: Philip J Fry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KevinJRattman/","96 products in account",""Make us whole, Isaac. Make us whole."\nTL;DR: Play as Isaac Clarke, the unluckiest son of a ♥♥♥♥♥(literally) engineer in video gaming history ever. Be haunted by a mysterious artefact that is somehow the key to stopping aliens(but still wants to kill you because plot holes).\n\nDead Space is supposedly a survival horror TPS game. While I personally don't think this game as a good horror game, it at least attempts(and sometimes succeeds), which is much more better then Dead Space 3(that game didn't even try).\n\nThis is what the game is about: you are part of a repair team, heading towards the USG Ishmura, the biggest 'Planet Cracker' in the universe. It sent out a distress call and lost connection, so you, as the engineer(you're accompanied by Kendra, a hacker, and Zach Hammond, a security officer, and his team), is to fix up Ishmura(and your ship as well, the USG Kelion) and find the source of the call. Of course, everything goes south when in the first 30 minutes, you become haunted by the 'Necromorphs', mysterious, grotesque and dangerous humanoid creatures that quickly panics the entire team. Now, since you're the only one able to do anything(because game protagonist logic), you have to find out what the ♥♥♥♥ happened here.\n\nThe game is kinda like what everyone calls it: Resident Evil in space. After all, the developers based the gameplay off of Resident Evil because they didn't have much time for development. Though there are very unique gameplay features in Dead Space.\n\nThe game doesn't have a HUD(Heads Up Display). Your health is represented by your RIG, the Resource Integration Gear. Everyone has one of these in the future- it a computer device(looks like a mechanical spine) that you attach on your back. Since this is a TPS, you can see your RIG most of the time, and as your health goes down, the bar on your RIG gets low(like how health bars get low), and it changes color to blue to yellow to red.\n\nThis game also has a inventory and a store system, so you press tab to see your inventory. When you press tab, your suit(you wear a engineering/or a mining suit that makes you look like a  badass [images1.wikia.nocookie.net]) will display a hologram inventory screen in front of you. It fits in with the SF feel of the game, and is much more immersive then a generic HUD. Your ammo will also be displayed when you aim, much like Halo, though your number of clips is not displayed, so you have to check your inventory.\n\nYou will find money inside crates and corpses of Necromorphs, which can be used at the store to buy ammo, health packs, etc. You will also find schematics for new items so you can just install it at the store and buy it. New suit schematic are important as they increase your armor and inventory size. You will also find 'Power Nodes' to open 'Node Rooms', which has very good things like much needed ammo on higher difficulties, and most important of all, new schematics(there are only one schematic for one item, so if you miss that schematic, it's gone for good).\n\nYou can also go to the Bench and upgrade your RIG(armor, health, air, etc), weapons, your Stasis Module which slows down enemies and objects, and your Kinesis Module which picks up heavy objects without a use of ammo- very important in higher difficulties. You upgrade them with Power Nodes, so be careful- you never know if you'll find a Node Room right after you spend all of your Nodes on upgrades.\n\nThere are also good variety of weapons, though the first free weapon you get, the Plasma Cutter, is very versatile and is good at everything(it's basically the best weapon in the game. you never want to sell it) As you can see from the name, it cuts things. It's a tool for cutting rocks, but in this game, it's used to cut off limbs. Why? Because headshots or bodyshots doesn't work for these monsters. You have to make them useless by cutting off their limbs. They don't die just from headshots(though they do lose their vision), and their torso is made out of ♥♥♥♥ing metal or something.\n\n\nSo we know the gameplay is at least something, so move on to the story- it actually has a very deep world(that you get to know more about in the second game), and the story intrigues you right from the start. The atmosphere and the story in general is heavily inspired by a 1997 movie 'Event Horizon'. The box cover for the game(a hand floating in space) is a homage to a scene in the movie, actually.(the more you know) It has that general feel of 'what the ♥♥♥♥ happened here' like in Half-Life or Bioshock(this game probably did the best job on that), and finding out the mystery by checking out all of the text logs is pretty fun. The dispute between Kendra and Zach(Kendra says 'let's get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here', while Zach says 'We still have a mission') also seemed to be pretty good, though it stops right after Kendra disappears, then she comes back then Zach disappears.\n\nOh, and Isaac- you just gotta ♥♥♥♥ing feel for him. He doesn't talk(he does in the later games), but he just does all of these things, and everytime he screams of fear(his 'AHHHHRG!!' is very memorable in some death scenes), you can't but say "dude... this is ♥♥♥♥ed up.". And oh yeah, the death scenes in this game is notorious for being grotesque(much like the rest of the game), and it's true. It's the only thing all of the fans have praised throughout the series(the later games adds even more).\n\n\nLet's take a look at some of the other miscellaneous things though- the graphics are not dated. It's good enough, and the gore is like I said, great(though I don't know if it's a good thing or not). The soundtrack is very similar to Half-Life's case. It's mostly ambient tracks, which makes the atmosphere a lot better, but lot less memorable.\n\nSo we narrowed down Dead Space, and is it a good game? Yes, it is. It's a great game in fact- and you can tell from all of what I said earlier. Though it still has its cons.\n\nThe controls. The game's notorious for having terrible mouse controls, while it gets better in the later games, and gets better in this game as well if you tweak some of the files, the fact that they haven't released a official patch on Steam makes me feel pain inside. The difficulty is also a problem. If you get used to it(and you will), it's really really easy. If you watch  Jesse Cox's   blind Dead Space playthough , he plays it on Medium and does not die a single time(and he's known to suck at bideo gems). The boss fights are especially bad- you just shoot at the yellow balls and poof, you win. Every. ♥♥♥♥ing. Boss.\n\nAlso, the 'survival horror' part is very subjective- the game does a good job of jumpscares in fact. They pop out of the vents and sometimes sneaks up on you, etc. They even play dead sometimes. But all of the monster spawns are scripted, so if you know where they'll spawn(or if you played 70 ♥♥♥♥ing hours like me), it's not that scary at all anymore. The atmosphere still might still spook you, though many people have said that they are not even scared of that anymore. Dead Space 2 and 3 leaves the whole 'closed down environment' atmosphere behind(well, maybe not Dead Space 3), but Dead Space 2 has other things to scare you(spoilers!).\n\nExcept for that, there isn't much to say. I give Dead Space a 8/10, it's a great game. The execution is near perfect, though the minor gameplay issues and the bugs ruins it a bit. The storyline is still great though, and since it is even more expanded in the later games, I highly recommend you to buy Dead Space 2 and 3 as well. In my opinion(that I will explain in the Dead Space 2 review), Dead Space 2 is gamelay-wise better, and while Dead Space 3 was a huge disappointment, it's still a good game and you should try it out.","May 15, 2015","true","69.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/recommended/17470/","Luriam","Luriam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/","307 products in account","Dead Space is the classic definition of horror. This game made me feel so uncomfortable and disgusted, yet so attached and interested. It has a good story, filled with mistery and conspiracy. Everything about the game feels right and natural. It delivers a solid gameplay, which consists of exploring and fixing a huge ship, fighting an endless variety of necromorphs, playing with gravity, crafting and upgrading equipment, uncovering the truth about what happened, and just trying to survive. You get to be Isaac Clarke, the "speechless" protagonist of the game, who slowly goes insane while under the effects of a "relic" called - The Marker.\n\nThe game's name is the perfect description of how the game feels. Everything seems so cold, so lifeless, diseased and abandoned. Everywhere you look, it's just cold metal walls, dry blood spilled on the floor and doors, rotten bodies everywhere and flickering xenon lights. Aside the ship, there are also times when you have to go "outside". The space looks gorgeous. It's dark and dangerous, but also endlessly beautiful. All of these create an unforgettable atmosphere, full of terror, shock and dementia. I wish I could say "Don't worry, it's not that scarry." But I can't. You will get scared. Even when you tread carefully, trying to notice the vents or ducts from where the necromorphs might come, you'll still get surprised every time. The developers have scripted the game so well, that it's impossible not to get scared. You'll start getting used to the monsters after a while. And when you're letting your guard down for a minute, just when you least expect it, you get a instant heart attack and a broken chair.\n\nDead Space makes you feel absolutely stranded, alone, but not helpless. The player can choose from a variety of weapons and tools. Which not only look cool, but also behave differently. And each of those weapons can be found and upgraded at the Work Benches. You also get to use Kinesis, which is totally awesome. Especially when combined with the Stasis. But what I liked the most most, was the suit. The RIG, as they call it, can also be upgraded and augumented. I just loved it. It looked so armored and heavy, and cold. But also so very cool and protective. The game becomes more challenging as you progress. There are new types of monsters lurking the corridors, wishing to get their... hands/paws/claws/teeth/blades/tails/tentacles/quills/proboscis/pustules and other limbs around your neck. But besides all those gruesome and brutal deaths, there are also other things that can and will kill you if you're not careful enough. Such as getting hit with some massive spinning tethers, getting electrocuted, running out of air, being hit with a meteorite, jumping into open space, and my personal favorite - getting crushed by a door. That's just what I remember anyway. But I'm sure there's a lot more to choose from.\n\nAnother absolutely great feature of this game is the sound and music. Everything sounds just right. Shooting sounds awesome. Stomping and punching the necromorphs feels so very satisfying, because I always found myself crushing every body I saw. Which is a little strange come to think of it... Oh, and the music. I don't know if you can really call it music, because it's mainly a series of very well done ambient soundtracks. Always tensionate, rhythmic, and terror-inducing. Nothing scares me more than a rotten-baby-tentacle-monster jumping on me, while some extremely loud and terrifying chimes are playing on the background. But it was also... fun. I liked to be scared. And if you like to be scared too, this is it my friend.\n\nAlthough this game was made back in 2008, it looks fantastic. It has got awesome lightning, good-looking models and a most satisfying dismembering system. You can literally tear someone's limbs apart, one by one. And a good physics engine that allows you to do a lot of crazy stuff with those gravity boots.\n\nFinally, a must play. It's a shame I haven't played this a long time ago. This game delivers an amazing experience, full of horror and action. With a good story and lovely sound design.\n\nYou need to hear this.\n\n\n\n10/10","April 5, 2014","true","17.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In many other horror genres I'd be able to call all the pop-up scares and gruesome mishaps...but not dead space. You can still see some coming, don't get me wrong, but there will be more times in which you just feel like screaming "NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE" the entire time something comes flying out to kill you when you are not looking.\n\nIn Dead Space, you play as the engineer known as Isaac Clarke who boards a deep space mining vessel to try to fix it up. However, just looking at the title, things do not go according to plan, and soon Isaac and his two other companions are having to fight for their lives aboard a vessel of the living dead. These creatures are not your normal run-of-the-mill zombies...they come in a variety of deadly shapes and sizes, all wanting your flesh. Oh, and when I say you and your two companions must fight, I mean YOU (Isaac) must fight; they provide you with objectives to the next area where things that want to kill you in the most gruesome ways imaginable reside.\n\nDead Space is a disturbing, gore-filled game that mainly the mature should purchase and play. It possesses an enthralling and suspenseful story as you must try to put together all the pieces to a nightmare brought to life. I cannot wait to play Dead Space 2 now as a result, and I highly recommend purchasing this game if you are up for a good scare every now and then. I must say that the game probably lacks some replay value (unless you play on the higher difficulty for the challenge). Not because it is a bad game by any means, but because the "scares" are never quite as good as your first runthrough of a horror game, especially when enemies have set spawn points and are not randomly placed. That being said, Dead Space constantly introduces new enemies, various weapons, upgrades, and fast-paced life-or-death scenarios throughout the entire gameplay that will keep you wide awake with a twitchy trigger finger.\n\nI'd easily give this game a solid 9 out of 10. So pick it up in the steam sales the next time you are up for experiencing something new or would just like a good scare.

I have played through this game a number of times on my Xbox 360, but since I've stopped using my 360 (but still wanted to play this game), I bought it on Steam.\n\nNow, I thought I should address this issue first:\n\nI have heard a lot of people complain about the mouse and keyboard controls in this game. My advice: buy yourself a wired Xbox 360 controller, download the drivers for it, and use that. Apparently bad keyboard/mouse controls aside, this game does feel like it was made for controller, and the controler settings are solid.\n\nNow onto the actual game:\n\nThe Positives:\n\n-- The story itself is good and I enjoyed it, but I felt like the story sometimes was a bit too far in the background (meaning I felt you were focusing purely on the objective and the story didn't really have much play in said objective). But overall, good story and despite the aforementioned, it was generally well implemented throughout the game. There are also twists, turns and little suprises that make it an awesome experience. Also, the ending was done really well!\n\n-- The atmosphere is fantastic! The got the lighting right, the sound effects right, crew logs, everything! It was just done so right!\n\n-- There are plenty of solid scares. There are some jump scares throughout the game and I know a lot of people hate those. But I'll be honest: jump scares really do work in this game.\n\n-- The weapons are very well done; although there are some weapon and general game mechanics that really do lend the player to using the basic starting weapon throughout the game (not that this is necessarilly a bad thing).\n\n-- Thought there is a realively straight forward (and argueably easy) way to play the game, there are so many other ways to play it. This ranges from weapons to the different modules (Stasis, Kenisis) to whether or not (and how) you use the object in the environment.\n\n-- There is enough variety in the enemies to make it interesting, but few enough to keep the game consistent ( if that makes sense). and as  the above point suggests, there is more than one way to fight each enemy (with the possible exception of the boss fights). I was say the enemies are very well done and always fun to fight.\n\n-- Boss fights are very well done, and the bosses are very cool!\n\n-- I know this is techincally part of the atmosphere of the game, but it is definitely worth mentioning on its own that the got creepy right! A lot of horror games get jump scares and maybe a few solid scares down-packed, but they never get the creepy element right enough to actually be creepy. This game does, and it does it well!\n\n\nThe Negatives:\n\n-- The thumb-stick controls can sometimes feel a bit slow. It does feel like it should be a bit more twitchy. That being said, the controls do work rather well, so this negative isn't all that bad.\n\n-- Picking up items can be annoying in a select few situations. For example, an item maybe under a Stasis recharge point and instead of picking up the item, it will constantly engage the recharge point instead. That being said, there are other ways to pick up that item, but still....\n\n-- Save points are not disabled during combat. Intead of picking up ammo during a fight that I desperately needed, the game instead activated the save point and I died. To be honest, this has only ever happened once (and I've done three run throughs of this game on normal and my third attempt at doing it on hard).\n\n\nOverall, this dismemberment simulator is a very solid game with pretty much everything done right!\n\n9/10","April 13, 2015","true","13.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The atmosphere throughout the campaign accomplishs what its goal, scare the hell out of you, at least in your first playthrough. More that once I was suspicious about entering a room or walking near a corpse.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, considering its kind of an old game. I have played Dead Space only with the xbox controller, and the mapping, movement and aiming were really good; don't know about keyboard/mouse.\n\nThe sound quality is amazing, the background music or noises that you hear makes you turn around and check for any foe. Sometimes when you are shooting a necromorph, you hear some odd noises behind you, and then you realize you got another necromorph behind you D:\n\nThe boss battles were nice, the upgrading system with nodes, and the store had me hook up in having everything upgraded and bought.\n\nI've played Dead Space like 6 times, and I do not regret it.

But as to why anyone would want to sit through this game is beyond me, since it's about as boring and generic as you can get. The approach to "horror" here revolves almost entirely around jump scares - and this would maybe be fine if the game weren't trying so hard to be "scary," but as is, it just becomes annoying. With the over the top dismemberment and enemy design, the mediocre attempts at "horror" become so extreme that they lose all potency and just become funny instead.\n\nSo, as a horror game, Dead Space is a failure. And as a shooter, it's competent, but the game takes place almost exclusively in dimly lit generic corridors, so it gets boring pretty quickly. The game also has some technical issues on the PC. For example, on my system, switching on VSync introduces a massive amount of input lag and make the game unplayable. Playing a game with VSync off is usually not such a big deal, but since the game is primarily illuminated by flickering lights, screen tear is a pretty big issue.\n\nHonestly, if you're interested in this game and haven't played System Shock 2, go play that instead. It's a much more compelling experience and infinitely more terrifying.","September 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The camera wouldn't move and when it did it would move really slowly, making the game pretty much unplayable. I found a fix for that which still didn't work very well so I decided to play with a 360 controller. That worked fine but then I got to a door which I couldn't walk through because there was an invisible wall in the way. Apparently the first enemy in the game is supposed to come through it and start attacking you but that never happened. It seems a few other people have had this problem because I was able to find a fix which requires you to record with FRAPS while playing which will make the enemy appear and the invisible wall to disappear allowing you to progress.\n\nI don't know why I should bother playing any longer if I've already had this many problems in the first 5 minutes of the game.

That is the short review. Since its been a while since I played it, that is the overrall tone of the game. You play as Isaac, an engineer who just can't catch a break. You go to investigate a ship that has gone dark and is in need of repair. Boy does it need repair. The game has jump scares which I don't find to be a negative because there is tons of others stuff that should creep you out. The ship is a character, as you piece the story together through various videos, documents, and audio journals. It is a creepy story. Also, you feel very alone. Even though you arrive with a small team, it quickly becomes apparent that no one can really help you. I like to think of the monsters as space zombies, and man are they freaky. Instead of the normal pop them in the head method, you have to take care of the limbs instead. There is a nice variety of weapons and armor to keep you on par with the nightmares you face. This is a game meant for playing after 10 PM with a good set of headphones. The ending is great and creepy and gets you ready for Dead Space 2. Even though it relies on shooting and blasting your way through, you will be on pins and needles the whole way through, wondering if your gun is enough to get you through in one piece.","February 22, 2015","true","35.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Isaac and his crew, Zach Hammond (who DIES) and Kendra Daniels (who ALSO DIES), Johnston and Chen (who DIE), exit the wormhole in their ship the "Kellion" and see how badly the Ishimura was ♥♥♥♥♥. The ♥♥♥♥ meter detects high levels of ♥♥♥♥ on the Ishimura and, like ♥♥♥♥tards, they decide to board the ship. Isaac is also there to find his ♥♥♥♥♥, Nicole Brennan (who WAS ALREADY DEAD). While traveling into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the Ishimura, the Kellion goes out of control and crashes into the docking bay.\n\nAfter this event happens, Isaac, Zach, Kendra, Chen, and Johnston miraculously get out of the ship without any wounds. As they run into the lounge of the ship, the whole place turns into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (as if it wasn't already) and all hell breaks loose. Isaac stands and watches through a window as his crew is attacked by creatures and Chen and Johnston are killed. Isaac has to run his unarmed ♥♥♥ out of there and go into an unstable elevator, then acquires a hideously overpowered futuristic staple gun that cuts most enemies into gory chunks in seconds. Later on, Isaac meets up with Unitologists who are batshit insane over the Marker which caused all of the ♥♥♥♥ on the ship to happen in the first place. One of the Unitologists, Dr. Challus Mercer (♥♥♥♥ING DIES), releases his "prototype/hunter" to kill Isaac. This creature is a pain in the ♥♥♥ due to the fact that IT CANNOT DIE unless you KILL IT WITH FIRE. It follows Isaac around throughout the rest of the game until he finally arrives at the shuttle where it can be burned. During all this, Isaac is constantly annoyed by Kendra, Zach, and his imaginary girlfriend, Nicole.\nEventually, Kendra becomes a Jew and runs off with the marker so she can sell it to some other colony. Fortunately, you pull that ♥♥♥♥ back into the ship and fly down to the planet that the ship is orbiting. Isaac then plants the marker on the planet because his (DEAD DEAD DEAD) girlfriend told him to. Being the ♥♥♥♥♥ that she is, Kendra reveals to Isaac that Nicole had killed herself and all this time he's been hallucinating, as the Marker used her image to control him and bring itself back to the planet, where it turns out Isaac made a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ monster wake up. Kendra gets eaten by it, the player kills it and escapes from the planet, the planet explodes, and Isaac is killed by his zombie girlfriend who inexplicably boarded the ship IT WAS A HALLUCINATION.\nAll in all, the entire ♥♥♥♥ing thing is pointless. You did not save a single soul, the monsters would have died of AIDS eventually, no one will know anything of what happened on that damned ship, and Isaac is still a tool who does whatever the ♥♥♥♥ people tell him to do DEAD ALIVE, SEQUEL ANNOUNCED.","December 12, 2013","true","3.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game has a great story as well and is followed up by Dead Space 2 in which in my opinion was the best of the 3 main Dead space games.\nDon't buy Dead Space 3 though if you want to play it, don't just watch gameplay of it's story and don't go near it. It's a horrible game.","December 1, 2014","true","27.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've finished the game and can barely wait to start the sequel!\n\nIt's an over-the-shoulder shooter (much like Resident Evil or Mass Effect), and the immersion is incredible. There's no HUD blocking the screen, ammo displays are on weapons and your health is displayed on the back of your character's suit. All the in-game menus (Maps, Inventory, Journal, etc) as well as video and audio communication are displayed with holographic projections from your suit. The game also has areas of zero-gravity where you must navigate your way by flying across the rooms, and hopefully not plunge into deep space.\n\nThe player takes the role of Isaac Clarke, an engineer and space ship systems specialist sent as part of a repair mission to the USG Ishimura, a large scale mining vessel. Upon arrival you quickly realize that disaster has struck the Ishimura and spend the game trying to get out alive. Throughout the game you can upgrade the space hazmat suit you wear, as well as buy and upgrade various weapons. The majority of the weapons you acquire are improvised tools, such as plasma cutters and buzz saws, reflecting that you're primarily an engineer, and not a soldier.\n\nAll in all it's a great buy; solid gameplay, a gripping story, and an incredible soundtrack.

Although there are a few parts that make it feel like Dead Space: Prepare To Die Edition this is a great game. The weapons and powers are cool. Everybody thinks Resident Evil in space but it's actually got A 3rd person Crysis look also. The creatures are INSANE, better than Doom III. Whoever designed them, pure genius, just VERY cool. If you are a fan of 3rd person shooters, this is a must have game. If you are a fan of horror, this is a must have game. If you are a fan of both, like I am, then you will be VERY happy that you gave it a chance. The creatures, weapons, and innovative gameplay are what make this game SO worth every penny. Playing Dead Space 2 soon and will review as soon as I finish the game but I already know that it will be even better somehow. Dead Space 3 is the questionable one, I guess it is unavailable on Steam but I will have to at least give it a chance too when it goes down in price enough.

It's a hard game but not unfair (unless you pick that difficulty!). The gameplay is fluid and the battles are fun whilst challenging.\nIt's also a great thriller game, with many moments made to get you to jump in your seat.\n\nGraphically speaking it's not a Crysis-level game but it still looks pretty damn good. The weapons and environemnts look nice, and the armour shines very well. You won't be disappointed.\n\nMaybe not worth $50 any more, but with how differently you can play with the varying weapons and abilities, it definitely has some replayability.

In fact its predecessor\nDead Space2 was the first of these kinds of games i forced myself through.\nI played this halfway through on a Xbox360 but never managed to get through completly...\nI will try to change that. Im just not that fast at it. I usally play 30minutes at a time, maybe that will increase over time\nBesides my own cowardness, this game is really good. Especially how it manages jumpscares.\nYou walk down a dark hallway, suddenly a random pipe bursts...\n"haahahahaha fooled you!...- No really, the monster is behind you."\nI fell for that one multiple times.\nI really like the story going on, thats whats getting me to start the game again from time to time.\n\nBuisnesswise it's a great example of an AA Game. It doesn't had a big marketing campaign and it didn't need to "appeal to a broader audience" like Dead Space 3. It was made for people who like to play horror games and that was just fine. Unfortunatly those days are long gone. With Dead Space3 we finally arived in an era where every game has to appeal to everyone, especially to CoD Players, since CoD is the best selling game ever (at that time) and EA wanted a piece of that cake too. It's just that CoD Players usally play CoD and are not that much interested in Horrorgames that try to appeal to them.\nAnyway, Dead Space is a gem of the days when development budgets weren't so high and the expectations neither. When a game could still be a sucess without selling 7 million copies. Dead Space knows what it wants to be (a mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is) and pulls it of perfectly.\n\nIf you are into horrorgames, this should be a nobrainer.\n\nKeep calm and shoot of their limbs.","February 9, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You're Issac and you have a bone to pick with space itself.\n\nYou and your friends fly to space's home and start looking for space. While you're looking for space monsters attack but they're easy. I played on hard by accident and didn't even had to use cheat codes. I kill boss and then I see I can have 5 another guns? Way too easy. I thought.\n\nBut it had deeper meaning. As you go, killing monsters and looking for escape from space's home you're struck with a shocking revelation in an unpredicted twist of events that made my heart stop and my blood froze:\n\nSPACE IS ALREADY KILL.\n\nI have to say I've never would even consider this turn of the events, but then I looked at the title of the game and saw how deep the story was, you could even say the story was as deep as space itself and that wouldn't be an exgaggaration by one bit. This plot twist raises so many questions that make you think long after you finish the game. Who kill space? How will Isacc live without space? How did Isacc come to space house if space was kill all the time?\n\nThis game has taught me how pointless the revenge is and how we should be respectful basic elements of reality like space, planets or microorganisms.\n\nOverall I give this game a score of 5 out of 6, 5 only because I was too scared to play after the plot twist.","November 8, 2013","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although there are a few parts that make it feel like Dead Space: Prepare To Die Edition this is a great game. The weapons and powers are cool. Everybody thinks Resident Evil in space but it's actually got A 3rd person Crysis look also. The creatures are INSANE, better than Doom III. Whoever designed them, pure genius, just VERY cool. If you are a fan of 3rd person shooters, this is a must have game. If you are a fan of horror, this is a must have game. If you are a fan of both, like I am, then you will be VERY happy that you gave it a chance. The creatures, weapons, and innovative gameplay are what make this game SO worth every penny. Playing Dead Space 2 soon and will review as soon as I finish the game but I already know that it will be even better somehow. Dead Space 3 is the questionable one, I guess it is unavailable on Steam but I will have to at least give it a chance too when it goes down in price enough.

I've finished the game and can barely wait to start the sequel!\n\nIt's an over-the-shoulder shooter (much like Resident Evil or Mass Effect), and the immersion is incredible. There's no HUD blocking the screen, ammo displays are on weapons and your health is displayed on the back of your character's suit. All the in-game menus (Maps, Inventory, Journal, etc) as well as video and audio communication are displayed with holographic projections from your suit. The game also has areas of zero-gravity where you must navigate your way by flying across the rooms, and hopefully not plunge into deep space.\n\nThe player takes the role of Isaac Clarke, an engineer and space ship systems specialist sent as part of a repair mission to the USG Ishimura, a large scale mining vessel. Upon arrival you quickly realize that disaster has struck the Ishimura and spend the game trying to get out alive. Throughout the game you can upgrade the space hazmat suit you wear, as well as buy and upgrade various weapons. The majority of the weapons you acquire are improvised tools, such as plasma cutters and buzz saws, reflecting that you're primarily an engineer, and not a soldier.\n\nAll in all it's a great buy; solid gameplay, a gripping story, and an incredible soundtrack. I highly recommend it.","December 30, 2014","true","22.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Forces you to carefully aim in tense situations.\n+Feeling of progression - upgradeable equipment/armor.\n+Little to no backtracking.\n\n-This is a personal complaint, but a 180 degree turn like in the action Resident Evil games would've been helpful.\n-Vsync forces 30fps.  I get about 350+ fps w/ vsync off with my gtx 970, causing horrible screentearing.  Vsync w/ nvidia control panel didn't work so I used D3DOverrider to force vsync at 60fps.

Play it at night, alone.\n\nThe first half of this review is a defensive measure against all of it's haters and critics here on Steam.\n\nNotice how all the negative reviews have either or both of two complaints: 1) the game doesn't run well, or 2) the controls suck because the port sucks. These people never thought to realize that maybe, just MAYBE, it's not the game that doesn't run well but it's their PC that doesn't run the game well. NEWSFLASH: If your PC blows or is outdated then you have no room to complain when a game any more demanding than Minesweeper runs poorly. There, I said it. Next up, the controls do suffer a bit at first but alas, we are humans, and we overcome and adapt to a new control scheme and feel for new games. Or at least some of us. Seriously, within an hour the controls felt fluid and fine. "Unplayable" they said. Seriously guys? Every game has a different feel, so why are you complaining about the mouse acceleration. Some people say it takes several seconds to turn around 180 degrees... Maybe turn your sensitivity up higher than 1%? I can turn around and have my gun drawn in less than half a second. These same people probably don't have the other half of their brain to even appreciate that slightly clunky controls actually makes this game better. Allow me to elaborate: You're Isaac Clarke, a man looking for his woman, stuck in a massive planet cracker starship infested and overrun with an unspeakable danger. You're scared. You're outgunned. Outnumbered. MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, having a "slow" response time and realistic movements makes the game feel better because it adds to the desperation and hopelessness of the atmosphere of the game. Not being able to instantly whip around or aim perfect head shots in 0.0065 seconds makes the game scarier. It really does. It takes away your control. It makes you feel like you are in just as much control of your situation as Isaac is, which isn't much. Having to take an extra half second to gain your bearings and wait for your body's momentum to stop in order to aim at your targets neck actually makes the game feel real and much more human. You feel vulnerable, and THAT is exactly why the controls and the feel of them make the game FEEL scarier.\n\nWith that said, this game is a masterpiece. I loved it. It mixed many different aspects of good storytelling, music, environment, horror, action, violence, and character development and put it into a unique universe. A hostile, bloody, dark universe full of cults and aliens. It kept me wanting to uncover more and more of why exactly things were happening and other character's motives. I was LEGITIMATELY scared at times in the game, namely in the beginning when I still had no clue the health, tactics, and potential that my enemies had. Everything was scary and mysterious. I kept to the wall and checked every corner with my plasma cutter drawn. Most of the scares are jump scares. But other times hearing whispers coming from the vents and the absolutely insanely eerie music made me want to take a break and come back when it was daylight. Eventually though I became more bold as I realized my enemies weak spots, becoming terrified for a moment upon seeing a new enemy type and trying to figure out how to avoid or kill it. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, never growing bored of it throughout it's about 12 hour campaign.\n\nPROS:\n-The music. Oh the music. Terrifying.\n-Sound effects were spot-on. Pipes clanked as I passed a vent, making me check them again. And again.\n-Ragdoll physics, though exaggerated, made ripping things to shreds so satisfying.\n-The graphics, for a 2008 (I believe?) title, were EPIC.\n-Details like writing, stains, blood, rust, etc... made the atmosphere creepy, dirty, and overall immersive. No corner-cutting here. I found an in-game alphabet decoder for alien writing, and while I've yet to see if it works, the effort behind each and every room is amazing.\n-Enemy types were fairly numerous. Some of them probably took a nightmare to think up. Fetus octopus zombies? No thanks.\n-Voice acting was phenomenal.\n-The HUD, or lack of, added the the feel of the game that I'm sure the developers wanted. When something did pop on screen, like a video call or map, it was never paused. I got attacked while upgrading my weapon at a weapon station. You are never safe unless you are saving or fully paused. The HUD was for Isaac, not me. We watch Isaac take the video call or look at his map, and there's something cool about that.\n-Movement, as I said before, is slow and clunky but it adds to the game's scary theme. You are supposed to be scared running, not a badass Duke Nukem liberator. Act like it.\n-Weapon variety was good too, although after trying a few, I stuck with the first mining tool, the plasma cutter. Upgrade that fully and it's the best gun in my opinion. I didn't even choose to unlock the later ones.\nThey seemed to pricey to fill up with ammo.\n-Awesome story and a really spooky ending, even to the very last frame.\n-Dead Space gave me a very different experience than any other game I've ever tried. It had a story, a twist, and characters that I won't soon forget.\n\nCONS:\n-They say in life, you either have money, time, or energy. As a child, you have time and energy, but no money. As a middle aged man, you have money and energy, but no time. As an elder, you have money and time, but no energy. Well... in Dead Space, it's very similar, except instead of time, money, and energy, it's health, ammunition, and credits. Except you only have one of each at any given time. I was CONSTANTLY either out of ammo and no credits to buy more but with full health. Or I had tons of ammo but no health or credits to get upgrades. I was always lacking one or two major requirements for a gunfight or boss battle. If you run out of ammo in a boss battle, there's nothing to do but die and backtrack and look for a couple more rounds of ammo. Or if you have no health but are forced to go to a boss battle anyways. Is it enough this time? Probably not. I get it, having sparse ammo makes the game feel scarier because you have to choose when and where to shoot instead of ripping people to shreds and having a lead finger on the trigger. But it really killed some parts of the game where you NEED lots of ammo and enemies just aren't dropping it, crates just don't contain it, and I don't have money for it. Dilemma: Spend all of my hard-earned credits on a new suit and be bankrupt or spend it all on enough ammo to get to the next chapter? The struggle is real gentlemen.\n-Character development on Isaac could've been better. He never spoke a single time. Is that good or bad? I felt like it's a bad thing because with his suit he seemed like a robot and it was hard to sympathize with him.\n-Puzzles got repetitive at times and seemed too easy. Although the meteor-radio transmitter puzzle stumped me for an hour. That one was rough for me because I was expecting it to be easy and kept looking past the obvious.\n-No way to re-read text logs. WHY? I love immersing myself into the story and being able to do that would have been so cool. I guess with video logs you could but still... Having them to re-read directions or to understand the story would have been welcome.\n-The tasks got repetitive. "ISAAC! The ship's parts are working again. I'll stay here where I'm safe and you go get 20 parts scattered across the ship with dozens of cannibal necromorph creatures that desperately want to chop your legs and face off in order to restore power to the ship's components so that we can repeat it all over again in the next chapter." I guess you have to go with this formula but it still got a little old in the way the tasks were presented.\n\nOverall this game rocked. It is not perfect, but it's shortcomings are highly outweighed by it's strongsuits. Definitely gave me chills and made me jump a few times. For that alone, I give it 9/10.","February 4, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In fact its predecessor\nDead Space2 was the first of these kinds of games i forced myself through.\nI played this halfway through on a Xbox360 but never managed to get through completly...\nI will try to change that. Im just not that fast at it. I usally play 30minutes at a time, maybe that will increase over time\nBesides my own cowardness, this game is really good. Especially how it manages jumpscares.\nYou walk down a dark hallway, suddenly a random pipe bursts...\n"haahahahaha fooled you!...- No really, the monster is behind you."\nI fell for that one multiple times.\nI really like the story going on, thats whats getting me to start the game again from time to time.\n\nBuisnesswise it's a great example of an AA Game. It doesn't had a big marketing campaign and it didn't need to "appeal to a broader audience" like Dead Space 3. It was made for people who like to play horror games and that was just fine. Unfortunatly those days are long gone. With Dead Space3 we finally arived in an era where every game has to appeal to everyone, especially to CoD Players, since CoD is the best selling game ever (at that time) and EA wanted a piece of that cake too. It's just that CoD Players usally play CoD and are not that much interested in Horrorgames that try to appeal to them.\nAnyway, Dead Space is a gem of the days when development budgets weren't so high and the expectations neither. When a game could still be a sucess without selling 7 million copies. Dead Space knows what it wants to be (a mean ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is) and pulls it of perfectly.\n\nIf you are into horrorgames, this should be a nobrainer.\n\nKeep calm and shoot of their limbs.","February 9, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Like any great horror game, the sound design is the single most effective element, and keeps you on your toes constantly...at least until the last quarter or so of the game, by which time things do become a mite predictable.  But apart from being a tad overlong for its own good, this is pretty well a must-play for anyone who loves the Silent Hill and/or Resident Evil franchises, or similar third person horror games...it's by and largely a remake of Resident Evil 4 set in space, if you want to be pedantic, but fresh enough for all that.  Story and setting-wise, its influences are more noticeably cinematic, namely 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Alien by way of John Carpenter's The Thing.  All exceptionally good company, in other words!  Spooky, fun, stupidly violent...all the things any sane person demands in a video game.  Looking forward to the next two!!!\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.","July 16, 2013","true","63.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

It was my first horror game and I have finished it on Xbox. Original story, surprising and terriying turns of events. Just a good game a good classic, if you can look past the graphics and small bugs this game had then I greatly advise that you play it, limited replayability but a good amount of playtime for the story, an impossible challenge on higher difficulties (you will have 0 ammo) and a game that will never give me back my heart that last necro stole from me. 7/10 (7/10 just because of it's age)","May 5, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coid/recommended/17470/","Coid","Catscratch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coid/","507 products in account","Definitely a game at the very least worth playing.\nDead Space brings to the table elements of both survival-horror and RPG while maintaining a (third-person) shooter image.\nThe storyline is fairly well written as while it's nothign special, it works out and it isn't boring really.\n\nThe game itself is challenging but not in an attritional sense where it's only hard because of the sheer amount of enemies as opposed t the design and challenges itself. It's a hard game but not unfair (unless you pick that difficulty!). The gameplay is fluid and the battles are fun whilst challenging.\nIt's also a great thriller game, with many moments made to get you to jump in your seat.\n\nGraphically speaking it's not a Crysis-level game but it still looks pretty damn good. The weapons and environemnts look nice, and the armour shines very well. You won't be disappointed.\n\nMaybe not worth $50 any more, but with how differently you can play with the varying weapons and abilities, it definitely has some replayability. Try to pick it up when you can.","March 4, 2012","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Она оставит впечатление покинутости, заброшенности. Это одна из тех немногих игр, весь ужас происходящегося в которых раскрывается через дневники и записи. И раскрывается настолько, что от представления описанных в очередном докладе событий холодеют ноги. Вы можете пройти ее, как шутер: убивая всех подряд, проводя часы в ходках по магазинам, но я все-таки рекомендую вам читать найденные дневники, сопоставляя происходящее там с тем, что творится на экране.

It's one of those adventure shooters that has ugly enemies. Whenever you pass by vents or see necromorph corpses that hasn't been disfigured, you'll already know that they're just there for jump scares. I will give points for the creepy atmosphere and all the bloody, organic rooms will give you chills. Bosses are also great, even though there's only three. The first one you encounter will let you use one of the game's mechanics of zero gravity jumps to dodge tentacles which makes you seem VERY cool and badass. The second one, I didn't enjoy much since I suck at aiming and then there's the gun overheating. The third and last one was actually a let-down compared the first one, which you'd expected it to be more of an overkill, slightly surviving with a slither of HP. The only thing good that came out of the last boss was how it picked you up and you were forced to use inverted controls to make you panic than you usually would. Then there's the storyline. I feel the twists were from an M. Night Shyamalan movie. You can already foreshadow what'll happen and the twists wouldn't really amuse you. It'll just give you sense of saying, "Welp, more work to do.". Character developement are pretty bad. All you know about the protagonist is that he's here on an adventure to find his girlfriend and slowly becoming loopy while not knowing about it. Really, the only thing that comes out of the storyline is the lore and backstory and most people who comes to shooters just want to use their itchy trigger-fingers and kill everything on sight. All-in-all, this game is just a generic shooter from Point A to Point B. It's a great shooter from its time I'll agree to that; however, it's not a scary game if you're wanting to buy this game for that sole purpose.\n\n+ Gameplay\n+ Use of Mechanics\n+ Puzzles\n+ Backstory\n- Current Game Storyline (Dead Space II or III might have a better storyline, which I'll have to see)\n- Final Boss\n\nI'll give it a 3/5.","January 27","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But on PC this game frigging ROCKS.  Like any great horror game, the sound design is the single most effective element, and keeps you on your toes constantly...at least until the last quarter or so of the game, by which time things do become a mite predictable.  But apart from being a tad overlong for its own good, this is pretty well a must-play for anyone who loves the Silent Hill and/or Resident Evil franchises, or similar third person horror games...it's by and largely a remake of Resident Evil 4 set in space, if you want to be pedantic, but fresh enough for all that.  Story and setting-wise, its influences are more noticeably cinematic, namely 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Alien by way of John Carpenter's The Thing.  All exceptionally good company, in other words!  Spooky, fun, stupidly violent...all the things any sane person demands in a video game.  Looking forward to the next two!!!\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.","July 16, 2013","true","63.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Viking_Mana/recommended/17470/","Viking_Mana","Viking Mana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Viking_Mana/","657 products in account","Dead Space relies very heavily on jumpscares and shocking imagery for it's horror. Don't get me wrong, it can certainly get quite tense every now and again, but it never really starts to feel like a 'Survival Horror' game as the game is fairly generous with both ammunition and health. Unless you're playing on higher difficulties you're probably not going to find the game all too challenging to be honest.\n\nThat being said, Dead Space ironically excels at one of the aspects often done poorly in horror titles: It's combat. Almost every weapon in your arsenal is viable in any situation, giving you some very refreshing freedom to find a playstyle that suits you. The violence and gore is definitely also satisfying for those of us that enjoy watching limbs come flying off. The voiceacting is solid and the soundwork in general is very tight.\n\nYou are very rarely (if ever) bored while playing Dead Space as you'll find yourself utterly immersed in it's great combat almost all the time, except for when the game gives you a break, typically in the form of exposition-sequences or fairly decent puzzles. While you don't have to be a math student to get over these hurdles they can definitely throw a spanner in the works every now and again.\n\n7/10 - Complete with a compelling story with a few surprising twists along the way I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes gore, violence and a character that controls like a tank. The only real downsides to this game I can think of off the top of my head is perhaps the slight lack of challenge, the unreasonably confusing map, and the fact that it has some severe issues with Mous/Keyboard controls. A gamepad is strongly recommended for this title.","June 9, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

AMAZING.\n\nDead Space is truly a horrifying game but a really fun one too! I'll just get straight to the pro's and con's, so you know what is right and wrong about this game!\n\n\nPROS:\n-The atmosphere for the game is just PERFECT! It mostly consists of Dark rooms with smoke/fog filled with dead bodies/blood. It is a very spooky game, which always keeps you on the edge of you're seat.\n\n-The ambience for the game once again is SO GOOD! You'll hear random screams, sometimes there will be sounds around you as if there is something crawling through the vents which just overall gives you LOTS of chills. It feels like anything could happen at anytime.\n\n-The fact that you are pretty much alone in this HUGE space ship filled with zombies/aliens really gives you the chills, and its just a perfect concept.\n\n-I really love the node system, how you find/buy nodes and can upgrade you're suit, weapons, or the stasis stuff you're suit has (I'll let you discover that on you're own!). Upgrading certain things really does make you feel stronger. I rememebr playing through this game once, hardly even upgrading any guns, and because of that, I looked at certain parts as a challenge, when the next time I played through the game, I tried my best to upgrade my weapons and health, which made those frustrating parts before such an easy task!\n\n-I LOVE the enemies. They truly are super freaky, especially when you have multiple enemies coming at you once, from different directions. Their screams, their looks, they are seriously the perfect enemies for a horror game like this.\n\n\nCONS:\n-There are really NO cons other than how sometimes the level designs can feel repetitive after awhile. That and, after fighting the enemies for a couple of chapters, they start to lose their spooky feeling, but they are still a big challenge to kill.\n\n\nFINAL SCORE:\n10/10\n\nRegardless of the small cons the game has, the game continues to be what it was truly meant to be, a horror/action game. and for the first time ever, I can say that EA did a great job! After beating Dead Space, I feel like I am now a true fan of the series, which is why I just HAVE to play the others.","January 7","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

My favorite thing about this game is the amount of ways that you can die, which made death a bit less frustrating and a bit more fun. The game also has a pretty novel fighting system, where it often makes sense to dismember enemies before killing them which I haven't seen to the same extent in any other games.

Everywhere I've seen I mentioned, everyone seemed to be completely in love with the game. I don't honestly see why.\n\nWhy not?\nThe game is honestly incredibly boring. Now. I love my survival horror games but I couldn't see what was so special about this game. The only scares were jump scares. Sure. The atmosphere was pretty decent but it didn't help me that the game pretty much told me when I should be scared. Early scare cords, the lights going out, plentifiul ammo. Not once did I actually feel like the game was pressuring me. I haven't played the second yet but I can't see why I would. I'm pretty much in the minority here but I honestly think the third game was a lot more fun. People complained that it removed the horror from the game but I ask. What horror?\n\nI feel like this game series would be so much better if it were to be just a straight up action game. Three was fun because of the co-op and gun creation mechanics. Things felt unique and interesting. I could kill things with a shotgun boozka or a revolver with a giant blade on the end of it with friends. Sure. That's a completely different game then this one but a much more enjoyable one at that. Take the good things from this game, the art style. The atmosphere. The unique monsters and put it into a better done genre then this.","April 19, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have since managed to make it into the game.  And while it is still nothing compared to part 2, It is at least worth playing so you can get a little more of the story.  However this one won't be played a second time.\n\nOn a lighter note though.  The Leviathan was done very well.\n\nPicked up the game because somebody mentioned it was the Alien game we've been waiting for.  If only that were true. Within the first 2 hours of play I was so unimpressed I doubt I will finish the game.  First off I don't know why they made it so you looked like a hunched over monkey when walking.  Second the creatures were not impressive and the weapons were even more lame.  I think I would give the flamethrower the award for most useless weapon of all time in any video game created.   The fights were predictible with little surprise.  Walk 10 feet have something drop down in front of you, shoot the leg and arm and it dies.  Rinse. Repeat.  Another thing,  I don't  understand why people think that just because you paint all the walls with blood it makes the game spooky.  It is very cliche' and not very imaginative.

Последние несколько лет его история была для меня одной из самых значимых в игровой индустрии, до прохождения 3-й части (спасибо Visceral Games, которые пошли на поводу у EA). До выхода серии игр Dead Space для меня была лишь одна игра данного жанра, которой я мог поставить максимальную оценку "отлично" - Resident Evil 4 (жаль, что ее нет в стиме). Но Dead Space расположил меня к себе настолько близко, что по сий день она для меня одна из лучших игр, в которые я вообще когда-либо играл! И дело совершенно не в страхе (там пугаться то нечему), главная фишка - сюжет. Особенно концовка! Вот с этим сценаристы постарались на славу! Я с нетерпением ждал 2-й части, т.к. интрига была весьма мощной. И в связи с этим я могу смело ставить "10 из 10", ибо соперничать с классикой RE4 не каждой игре дано, ИМХО!","August 27, 2013","true","6.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CarnivalNights/recommended/17470/","CarnivalNights","Carnival Nights!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CarnivalNights/","592 products in account","Not many horror games use space as the backdrop and the few that do, usually do so with raving success. Dead Space is part of that. It's terrifying, but like any scary game, the longer you play it, the more desensitized to the fear you get. That and paired with the fact that you eventually (should you choose to) upgrade your weapons to a high degree usually means the monsters that scare you die in embarassing fashion.\n\nThe method is in which this game does go out to scare you is cheap as well. There are a lot of jump scares and set pieces. Any time you enter a large enough room, you know there will be an ambush. Eventually, you can start predicting when the scares happen. Monsters come out through vents and the predictable blind corner will usually have one waiting for you. Vents are scattered throughout the ship you're stranded on, so when you instinctively feel like an ambush is going to happen, it's easy to set yourself up and defend the waves.\n\nGood game overall. Scary games of this type should be shorter though because you can feel that the developers themselves know that you're no longer scared so what they'll do with ambushes is just increase the waves, turning what's supposed to be scary into a full blown shoot out with paced rumbles that can sometimes last longer than you have patience for.\n\nThe Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star rendition was sp00ky though.","January 31, 2015","true","24.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That is as much as you need to know about it, there are many things that can be said, but it all boils down to "Dead Space" being an excellent game. It is completely worth the $19.99 steam is asking for it, but if you have waited this long to buy it, im sure you can wait a lil longer still for one of their many sales and pick it up a tad cheaper.\n\nMy one complaint of the entire deadspace series (well, 3 has a few, but this isnt the place for that :P) is that a few of the controls are hardbound and cannot be remapped. That forced me to use a controller for the duration of the series, except during very brief sections of the game when you take control of a very large gun and it was simply too dificult for me to complete with the controller.\n\nNot reccomended for children under the age of 16 in my oppinion, or those prone to nightmares or anyone with a weak heart.","January 8, 2014","true","54.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It wound up in my library through a HumbleBundle, and I decided to give it a play. I instantly regretted passing over this game all those years ago. The gameplay is great. Getting used to the control scheme and view point is not automatic, but it quickly becomes second nature. Characters are well thought out, and are developed excellently. Im a big sucker for a good story in video games, and Dead Space absolutely delivers. The story is fleshed out, and develops nicely as the game progresses. The atmosphere is excelent. I cannot stress this enough, the game keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The environment is littered with potential threats, keeping you constantly scanning. The designers didnt stop there though. They paired this trecherous environment with a "weapon" collection that some how just never has enough ammo, and a character that just cant ever get his hit points back up to full. Exhaustive scavenging and ammo conservation are essential to success, but then that just loops back to an environment that is trying to kill you 100% of the time. All in all, the game is absolutely amazing, I couldnt get enough of it, and if you dont buy it now, you will forever regret it.","January 5, 2015","true","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/domocracy/recommended/17470/","domocracy","Leeroy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/domocracy/","158 products in account","Worth buying at at least 66% off via my "Never buy games at full price" motto and "Percentage-to-hours" hypothesis (accounting hours played and enjoyment in regards to the absolute lowest percentage that I would consider buying it at if I suddenly lost the game and had to rebuy it).\n\nPros:\nThe story is incredible: the main protagonist doesn't speak or react to events, so it honestly feels like you're in the seat, which is perfect for a horror/survival shooter like this. The NPCs are vital to the story (there's 4 major ones, and a fifth person who appears every now and then and is a key part in the backstory) and feel realistic, and they add to the game experience unlike many games out there these days. The game's mechanics are timeless and the graphics are splendid, even if the game is generally dark. I felt emotionally attached to this game (more than any other, at least) because of how well the developers created the events in the story; stuff felt like it was happening to me, and that's the sign of a well made game. Save points are everywhere, checkpoints are well placed before major events, stores are crucial to the development of the character, and benches are your best friend who only turns up once a month (or in this case, chapter) but are a blast to hang out with (you upgrade you gear here with power nodes). This game was clearly designed with a lot of thought.\n\nCons:\nThe lack of gamepad mapping was kind of annoying at first, but the controls are still good. Sensitivity is downright poor sometimes, especially with the mouse. The bosses were not hard: the one in the middle or just past the middle was harder than the last one, and took way longer. Ammunition is very important in this game, which made it super annoying that enemies that dropped ammo before would often not the later on in the game it got. The story towards the end felt a little forced, but if it was planned with Dead Space 2 in mind, then it's fine, but it just felt like it happened because they did not want **START OF SPOILER** an unhappy ending **END OF SPOILER**. however this does not affect how I feel about the game. The game had some annoying glitches in it, like getting stuck in places in zero gravity and not being able to get out, and also falling through lifts into space and dying if you were not properly on the lift when you activated it. The machine gun-type weapon you use two times to clear asteroids had bad controlling, but it wasn't hard to beat that bit anyway. There's not much in terms of weapon variation, and you can very easily beat the game by just using a Plasma Cutter, maxing it out with the power nodes in the bench, maxing out your RIG the same way, and buying plasma energy all game.\n\nOverall, I give this game a rating of 9/10. You could tell that this game's multiplayer could be incredible if done right, but unfortunately it doesn't come until Dead Space 3 (EDIT: Dead Space 2 has a nice 8 player, 4v4 mode that's actually not too bad). The game's single player is a top 5 best campaign in shooter gaming history, with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Halo, Half-Life and maybe Half-Life 2. The controls on the PC port are pretty unresponsive with the mouse, but with the controller it's basically solved, though there seems to be no remapping, which is off putting to some. Because of this, I got the full experience of this game (dark setting, headset on, XBOX 360 controller) and enjoyed it immensely.\n\nHandy tip: when you reach the Target Practice minigame, I have a feeling that if you play it enough, you will not have a credits problem/deficiency for the rest of the game. So when you reach it, play it a lot and you will have all the money you need.","January 14, 2015","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

This game perfectly blends quick responce and beutifuly smooth combat with a suspensful, scarry and well designed atmosphere. The enemys in this game are downright terrifying, and the story is awesome. The game has a linier campain, but is packed full of Bioshock-like RPG elements. The scarres in this game are real, not just popout stuff (although there are quite a few popouts), and it is one of the gorriest games I have ever seen! Even for being about eight years old the graphics are astounding. Like I said, the story is really good, it keeps you going in a great way, something that not a lot of games do. The voice acting is on point, from the chracters you meet, to the audio logs you find in lockers.  If you ever get stuck somewhere you just hold down B and a blue line shows you where to go, and you can check Isaac's commentary/journal if you are still lost. The entire game is in third person, which I did enjoy. This game is so fun, this is something that all gamers should experience.  If I were to rate it, I would totally give it a 10 out of 10, this game is a masterpiece and deserves every bit of the praise and populartiy it gets.

Vague story that unlocks more as you play and pick up text and audio logs.\nThe biggest problems I have are as follows:\n1: Not scary. Never once during this game did I shout in horror or scream in fear as a monster popped out of a grate. I mean, you KNOW they're coming out of the vents because an audio log tells you so.\n2: Mouse lag. This is a big problem, but it can be fixed turning on Vsync on your GPU, not in the game.\n3: Plasma Cutter beats all. There is no better weapon.\nBut overall, its a solid game. The dismeberment aspect of the game, needed to kill the monsters in the game, is something I haven't seen in an another game ever. Graphics are pretty good, but occasionally spotty graphics.\nI didn't find the monsters a challenge on Normal difficulty (I have yet to play the game again on a harder mode).

Nearly unparalleled. I'm almost happy to give up some control responsiveness for how gorgeous and immersive this game is. You have to play it to understand. And if you're the least bit adventurous, in the middle of the night with some nice headphones, in the dark. The jumpscares are great! I think this game made my little brain go "DIE!DIE!DIE!KILLITWITHFIRE!!!" more than any other game before it. But lemme say something again, the movement and punch/kick controls are terrible. Like I said, I'm ALMOST happy to give up some control responsiveness, too much was taken away though. But if you sharpen your aim enough, and make those couple of hits you DO have time to get in count, well, you can learn to live with it. It's certainly one of the most sluggish I've ever played.\n\nThe sound (even if at times predictably string-section-horror-y) and music fit the setting very well. And the visuals, I'm happy to say are impressive in many ways even today, in 2014. Something else worth mentioning is how expertly executed the TOTAL absence of user-interface was in DeadSpace. I absolutely LOVE that everything about the world you're in, must be accessed through the character you inhabit. He has various projectors built into his suit which project the prompts, information, and statistics you would expect to find up front and in your face with this type of game. But here, you see it as your character might, seemingly floating in the air beside your character. As you pan and position your camera angle, the world rotates in a detached way, giving you moments of surreal perspective on what you might look like from someone elses eyes in there, in that dark bloody mess of a futuristic room. The experience is certainly not one I think any mature gamers should miss. This would've INSTANTLY cursed me with nightmares for a month when I was younger.\n\nAs for the story, replayability, and evolution of the game. I actually haven't played through the entire thing and don't want to misjudge it based only on what I've seen so far between PC and console version. But either way, it has been very good over all and a game I definitely recommend picking up.","January 22, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If so, then Dead Space is for you.\n\nThe best aspects of Dead Space are the sound, music, and overall solitary/frightening mood the game sets. There were several occasions where I found myself turning around because I heard something echoing in the distance… sounding as if it was coming closer. Even the zero gravity heavy steps you take sound fantastic with a hollowed, deep bass sound. When the environment is right and the audio is incredibly well done, you have a great setting for a game.\n\nThe biggest downside of the game was the linear story line. You get a few options of which upgrades you would like to make to your gear but really, you will only want to use 1 maybe 2 guns as some are very weak and pretty much useless. The character development is bland as well. Do not play Dead Space looking for a great story because you will not find it.\nThe gameplay may also feel stiff at first, even for a third person shooter but it kind of makes sense. You are in a heavy space suit, your mobility should be limited. To counter this, the gun controls are tight and precise. You can really feel the power of them (especially once upgraded).\n\nEven with the nearly non-existent story, the environment really immersed me.

This game packs action, horror, survival, and a very nice story. It kinda gets repetitive when you are almost finishing it, (i wont enter details to not spoil) but if you dont mind that. I barely got anything to complain about the game, I personally had no bugs nor glitches, except from one fps problem wich made my mouse lag, in the start you wont pay a lot of attention to it, but when you progress it will start to feel waaaaaay too annoying to let it be... once you fix that, the game can be played as any other. Very nice graphics for the time it was made, sound could've been improved, very AWESOME story, with lots of information of what's going on before your arrival, you can see the progressive madness that the crew of the ishimura had, how did it start, who or what is responsible for it, it is simply very awesome. Isaac could've been a more... how to say it... memorable character, I dont like mute characters, but i can really make an exception on Isaac, the game lenght is very nice I would say that it can be won on 13 to maybe 15 hours on normal difficult, you can replay to see if you got most of the audiologs, and to maybe try another difficult, or just a different weapon combination.\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 7/10\nStory: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10 With no bugs on my playthrough\nGeneral score: 8.5 (for regular people) 9.5 (for survival horror fans)\n","January 13, 2014","true","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Whatever you call it. Graphic quality is ok, but ♥♥♥♥ poor optimization ruins the game. Still playable though.\n\nControl is no good either. You can't possibly remap, in-game, buttons as freely as you want. Your mouse's side buttons can't be mapped. Really unhappy with the awkward button mappings by default either.\n\nGame definitely isn't 86/100. 70/100 to be more precise. The good side of the game is the true scare factor.\n\nAnyway, worth playing if you like horror game. Well, it's less than a dollar game, after all (humble bundle ahem).

Outside of fixing the communications issues, Isaac has a number of reasons for arriving on the Ishimura -- he has a number of friends that are stationed on the ship, including someone very special to him that sends an urgent holovid with a few cryptic messages before she disappears. Unfortunately for Isaac and his crew, shortly after they arrive on board the crippled vessel, all hell breaks loose. Their craft is destroyed, leaving them stranded on the Ishimura. The crew is attacked by nightmarish creatures known as Necromorphs, who kill most of Isaac's team and separate him from the surviving members. Even worse, the ship and its systems have started to be corrupted or are failing thanks to the Necromorphic infestation. It's up to Isaac to wander the halls, search for any friends or survivors that are still alive, and fix as many problems as he can until he can find a way to escape the ship, which can take you 12 or more hours to complete.\n\n- Jeff Haynes (ign.com) -","December 24, 2015","true","18.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The atmospheric bangs and clangs of necromorphs running through vents above you, roaring in the distance, orchestral stings and satisfying gun sounds add a lot to what is otherwise a very bland gaming experience. Unfortunately a lot of the sounds seem to be in low bitrate, which is a shame.\n\nIt’s also a lot of fun to dismember necromorphs with the plasma cutter.

Bottom line is that without some out-of-game tweaking, you won't be able to tolerate playing this game.\n\nIf you are okay with some mild tweaking then you might be alright with it, but out-of-the-box it isn't good.\n\nThe first port issue is the low FOV that can't be adjusted in-game. I found the default FOV absolutely terrible, and would have stopped playing if I couldn't fix it. You can fix this manually with "Widescreen Fixer," which is a program you download and run alongside this game that can modify the FOV.\n\nThe second issue is the mouse sensitivity. Apparenlty it varies with the framerate. You're probably thinking "okay, I'll run vsync" but apparently in-game vsync has problems as well. I turned off vsync and ran a framerate limiter and it helped a lot. The mouse issues are not as bad as Bioshock, but they are unacceptable without fixes. In-game (i.e. not options) menus are navigated through arrow keys by default, so not much exposure to mouse menus; though the options mouse menus doesn't feel as bad as Bioshock.","February 17, 2015","false","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

LOADS of windows. But, it still would have a terrifying atmosphere even without those scares. Just the fact that it gave you about a magazine for every 3 zombies and that you could kill about 2 zombies with 1 magazine meant that you had to find your way around zombies, which meant dodging around them or taking a longer but safer route around the mansion. THAT is survival horror.\n\nBut Dead Space, which clearly takes inspiration from Resident Evil Remake, (because what survival horror doesn't?) doesn't take things like the atmosphere. I mean sure, it has scary moments, even when enemies aren't there, but that's just because I'm afraid something will jump out and a loud musical sting will play. I'm not scared of the ship, or the monsters, I'm scared of the musicians slamming there hands down on the piano again.\n\nAlien Isolation, a game that came out in 2014, last year, go 'it'. How to do survival horror without unscripted jumpscares, and having an oppressive atmosphere. The bit when you walk through the synthetic bay, where all the dying 'Working Joe's' go to die. You walk through a corridor with about 10 'Working Joe's' standing idol, and you just know that if you turn your back they'll throttle you, but they don't until 10 minutes later when the game throws 8 shotgun shells, 3 flares, 2 medkits and 6 revolver bullets at you, but that's besides the point.\n\nI do not think that this is a bad game, I just don't think it's a good one either. It takes the claustrophobia and 'survival horror' from RE:R and A:I but they seem a lot clumsier here. Sure you may love this game, but I'll stick with the good stuff until EA get this right the fourth time round.","August 27, 2013","false","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The games few high points come in a few clever environmental puzzles and a few fights where you have room to maneuver and aim. Unfortunately, there's a lot of just boring traversal and extremely cramped fights where you just dump ammo to avoid getting stun locked and killed. The story is very poorly written and told, it tries to be immersive but there's just no depth to it and the game tries to pull multiple twists that don't even make sense or carry any weight. The final boss fight might be the most frustrating part of the game as there's a lengthy unskippable cutscene at the start AND an even longer unskippable cutscene if you die.\n\nAdd to all that, you need to tweak the game to even use the mouse like a mouse and no FoV and the game is exceedingly awkward at times. I played with a controller and the sensitivty was either too high for precision or too low to move and turn efficiently. I didn't feel the game was more suspenseful due to the controls, it just felt poorly made. This was especially prevalent in bossfights and certain sequences when you were grabbed and had to free aim while being jerk around. I died a number of times because both your firing point AND the spot you're shooting are snapping around with no fluidity at all. Certain enemies have animations where they're invincible and you have to wait for them to snap to another animation for them to be vulnerable again which looks awful and is tedious.\n\nThe only way I would recommend this game is if you absolutely love suspense/horror as everything else it tries to do is done better somewhere else.","February 24, 2015","false","24.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Bottom line is that without some out-of-game tweaking, you won't be able to tolerate playing this game.\n\nIf you are okay with some mild tweaking then you might be alright with it, but out-of-the-box it isn't good.\n\nThe first port issue is the low FOV that can't be adjusted in-game. I found the default FOV absolutely terrible, and would have stopped playing if I couldn't fix it. You can fix this manually with "Widescreen Fixer," which is a program you download and run alongside this game that can modify the FOV.\n\nThe second issue is the mouse sensitivity. Apparenlty it varies with the framerate. You're probably thinking "okay, I'll run vsync" but apparently in-game vsync has problems as well. I turned off vsync and ran a framerate limiter and it helped a lot. The mouse issues are not as bad as Bioshock, but they are unacceptable without fixes. In-game (i.e. not options) menus are navigated through arrow keys by default, so not much exposure to mouse menus; though the options mouse menus doesn't feel as bad as Bioshock.","February 17, 2015","false","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

LOADS of windows. But, it still would have a terrifying atmosphere even without those scares. Just the fact that it gave you about a magazine for every 3 zombies and that you could kill about 2 zombies with 1 magazine meant that you had to find your way around zombies, which meant dodging around them or taking a longer but safer route around the mansion. THAT is survival horror.\n\nBut Dead Space, which clearly takes inspiration from Resident Evil Remake, (because what survival horror doesn't?) doesn't take things like the atmosphere. I mean sure, it has scary moments, even when enemies aren't there, but that's just because I'm afraid something will jump out and a loud musical sting will play. I'm not scared of the ship, or the monsters, I'm scared of the musicians slamming there hands down on the piano again.\n\nAlien Isolation, a game that came out in 2014, last year, go 'it'. How to do survival horror without unscripted jumpscares, and having an oppressive atmosphere. The bit when you walk through the synthetic bay, where all the dying 'Working Joe's' go to die. You walk through a corridor with about 10 'Working Joe's' standing idol, and you just know that if you turn your back they'll throttle you, but they don't until 10 minutes later when the game throws 8 shotgun shells, 3 flares, 2 medkits and 6 revolver bullets at you, but that's besides the point.\n\nI do not think that this is a bad game, I just don't think it's a good one either. It takes the claustrophobia and 'survival horror' from RE:R and A:I but they seem a lot clumsier here. Sure you may love this game, but I'll stick with the good stuff until EA get this right the fourth time round.","August 27, 2013","false","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The games few high points come in a few clever environmental puzzles and a few fights where you have room to maneuver and aim. Unfortunately, there's a lot of just boring traversal and extremely cramped fights where you just dump ammo to avoid getting stun locked and killed. The story is very poorly written and told, it tries to be immersive but there's just no depth to it and the game tries to pull multiple twists that don't even make sense or carry any weight. The final boss fight might be the most frustrating part of the game as there's a lengthy unskippable cutscene at the start AND an even longer unskippable cutscene if you die.\n\nAdd to all that, you need to tweak the game to even use the mouse like a mouse and no FoV and the game is exceedingly awkward at times. I played with a controller and the sensitivty was either too high for precision or too low to move and turn efficiently. I didn't feel the game was more suspenseful due to the controls, it just felt poorly made. This was especially prevalent in bossfights and certain sequences when you were grabbed and had to free aim while being jerk around. I died a number of times because both your firing point AND the spot you're shooting are snapping around with no fluidity at all. Certain enemies have animations where they're invincible and you have to wait for them to snap to another animation for them to be vulnerable again which looks awful and is tedious.\n\nThe only way I would recommend this game is if you absolutely love suspense/horror as everything else it tries to do is done better somewhere else.","February 24, 2015","false","24.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately a lot of the sounds seem to be in low bitrate, which is a shame.\n\nIt’s also a lot of fun to dismember necromorphs with the plasma cutter.

The NPCs are vital to the story (there's 4 major ones, and a fifth person who appears every now and then and is a key part in the backstory) and feel realistic, and they add to the game experience unlike many games out there these days. The game's mechanics are timeless and the graphics are splendid, even if the game is generally dark. I felt emotionally attached to this game (more than any other, at least) because of how well the developers created the events in the story; stuff felt like it was happening to me, and that's the sign of a well made game. Save points are everywhere, checkpoints are well placed before major events, stores are crucial to the development of the character, and benches are your best friend who only turns up once a month (or in this case, chapter) but are a blast to hang out with (you upgrade you gear here with power nodes). This game was clearly designed with a lot of thought.\n\nCons:\nThe lack of gamepad mapping was kind of annoying at first, but the controls are still good. Sensitivity is downright poor sometimes, especially with the mouse. The bosses were not hard: the one in the middle or just past the middle was harder than the last one, and took way longer. Ammunition is very important in this game, which made it super annoying that enemies that dropped ammo before would often not the later on in the game it got. The story towards the end felt a little forced, but if it was planned with Dead Space 2 in mind, then it's fine, but it just felt like it happened because they did not want **START OF SPOILER** an unhappy ending **END OF SPOILER**. however this does not affect how I feel about the game. The game had some annoying glitches in it, like getting stuck in places in zero gravity and not being able to get out, and also falling through lifts into space and dying if you were not properly on the lift when you activated it. The machine gun-type weapon you use two times to clear asteroids had bad controlling, but it wasn't hard to beat that bit anyway. There's not much in terms of weapon variation, and you can very easily beat the game by just using a Plasma Cutter, maxing it out with the power nodes in the bench, maxing out your RIG the same way, and buying plasma energy all game.\n\nOverall, I give this game a rating of 9/10. You could tell that this game's multiplayer could be incredible if done right, but unfortunately it doesn't come until Dead Space 3 (EDIT: Dead Space 2 has a nice 8 player, 4v4 mode that's actually not too bad). The game's single player is a top 5 best campaign in shooter gaming history, with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Halo, Half-Life and maybe Half-Life 2. The controls on the PC port are pretty unresponsive with the mouse, but with the controller it's basically solved, though there seems to be no remapping, which is off putting to some. Because of this, I got the full experience of this game (dark setting, headset on, XBOX 360 controller) and enjoyed it immensely.\n\nHandy tip: when you reach the Target Practice minigame, I have a feeling that if you play it enough, you will not have a credits problem/deficiency for the rest of the game. So when you reach it, play it a lot and you will have all the money you need.","January 14, 2015","true","10.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The scarres in this game are real, not just popout stuff (although there are quite a few popouts), and it is one of the gorriest games I have ever seen! Even for being about eight years old the graphics are astounding. Like I said, the story is really good, it keeps you going in a great way, something that not a lot of games do. The voice acting is on point, from the chracters you meet, to the audio logs you find in lockers.

Outside of fixing the communications issues, Isaac has a number of reasons for arriving on the Ishimura -- he has a number of friends that are stationed on the ship, including someone very special to him that sends an urgent holovid with a few cryptic messages before she disappears. Unfortunately for Isaac and his crew, shortly after they arrive on board the crippled vessel, all hell breaks loose. Their craft is destroyed, leaving them stranded on the Ishimura. The crew is attacked by nightmarish creatures known as Necromorphs, who kill most of Isaac's team and separate him from the surviving members. Even worse, the ship and its systems have started to be corrupted or are failing thanks to the Necromorphic infestation. It's up to Isaac to wander the halls, search for any friends or survivors that are still alive, and fix as many problems as he can until he can find a way to escape the ship, which can take you 12 or more hours to complete.\n\n- Jeff Haynes (ign.com) -","December 24, 2015","true","18.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Vague story that unlocks more as you play and pick up text and audio logs.\nThe biggest problems I have are as follows:\n1: Not scary. Never once during this game did I shout in horror or scream in fear as a monster popped out of a grate. I mean, you KNOW they're coming out of the vents because an audio log tells you so.\n2: Mouse lag. This is a big problem, but it can be fixed turning on Vsync on your GPU, not in the game.\n3: Plasma Cutter beats all. There is no better weapon.\nBut overall, its a solid game. The dismeberment aspect of the game, needed to kill the monsters in the game, is something I haven't seen in an another game ever. Graphics are pretty good, but occasionally spotty graphics.\nI didn't find the monsters a challenge on Normal difficulty (I have yet to play the game again on a harder mode).

Resident evil 4 was by no means a horror masterpiece, but it was campy and fun, and its gameplay was fantastically implemented, with set pieces oozing from it's pores to thrill the player.\n\nDead space tried (and failed) in my opinion to bring back any of that tension. Instead we have a linear set of sequences filled with scripted jump scares from monsters overdesigned to look horrific.\n\nThere's only a few times of note worthy moments in this game. One in particular was when you enter a room full of dead bodies, and later the game loops around to this room, except now it is populated with a monster which can make monsters from corpses. I had never encountered this monster before I found this room the first time. I instinctively dismembered all of the corpses, and when I came back around it paid off, instead of a dozen monsters I only had to deal with one. That was a moment of rewarding the player for actually playing the game in a way a video game should be played, trusting the player to emergent decisions as opposed to leading them down set routes with set expectations of play. It did that moment once.\n\nSo much potential wasted as well. It would have been a lot better if it was more open, Metroidvania. It had the capacity to do that since we have the floor system. And the scripted jump scares could have been randomised or intellegently coded AI which could determine a best attack when the player is at their weakest.\n\nIn short, this series is overhyped garbage.","February 2","false","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenoDerpimus/recommended/17470/","XenoDerpimus","漫画 Xenos 漫画","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenoDerpimus/","101 products in account","Dead Space is a great example of a game that puts you on egde. It never truly scares you, but it certainly makes you raise your guard constantly knowing that despite your best paranoid efforts, a necromorph will still startle the crap out of you from behind. Being locked in a room with twenty enemies and low ammo certainly puts you through a major stress test.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, I personally believe Dead Space 1 was the pinacle of Dead Space gameplay. Isaac didn't say anything, and the environment fit perfectly in place with what it was supposed to be: An abanadoned, infested space station. Your two allies only called every now and then, so as to not oversaturate the game with dialogue and let you focus on absorbing the atmosphere and enjoying the awesome limb-splattering combat system.\n\nThe combat system is nearly sheer perfection in terms of feeling. Every shot from most weapons can seriously pack a punch when upgraded, and there is nothing more satisfying than shooting somebody so hard all their limbs fly off or their head explodes. Every enemy was satisfying and fun to fight, with the exception of the f*cking Guardians, which felt like a cheap gimmick at first and always turned into a chore.\n\nThe story is pretty weak at best. It all comes down to Isaac basically repairing the entire space station then attempting to retrieve "The Marker", which he fails at as well. Thankfully, once I really started playing I didn't even care it had a bad story anymore. The gameplay was addictive and multipaced: going from slow to incredibly fastpaced in mere seconds. This more than made up for a horrible story.\n\nAt the end of the day, the story sucked, but the game was hella fun to play. It's even one of the few games I have fully replayed just for the gameplay, so that should mean something at least. Doom didn't need a good story to be an awesome time blowing off demon and alien limbs, why should Dead Space need a good story too?","February 29","true","22.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game starts out in the survival horror vein, but soon suffers an identity crisis, locking the player in arena-like spaces with dozens of fast moving monsters attacking at once, which is dubious considering that the character is as agile as a pregnant potato and takes up at least a third of the screen. Choosing a third-person perspective for a game with a silent protagonist is another strange design decision that removes any sense of immersion, especially when the character just stands over a dying woman like a manikin with no trace of emotion. Add highly repetitive and mostly predictable gameplay involving completing two to three objectives per level, some of which are recycled later on, and there is no surprise that Doom 3 ends up a far superior game, with near identical visuals and storyline, but no artificial handicaps, better immersion, action, and horror.","January 31, 2015","false","21.1"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","47","14","30","6","0"

The ambient musicl is marvelous, as well as the enigmatic and frightening fog and dark, creepy lights in every room or corridor you happen to be at. You will never know what's coming up next (ok, after some hours you might already guess that a wave of specimens is gonna spawn, but trust me, even if guessing, that doesn't takes the panic away. You have to fight them back after all), and overall this game feels like you are in the main role in a sci-fi horror movie, as everything is so atmospherical you actually believe you are Isaac Clarke, it's so inmersive and deep (I recommend playing this at night with a decent volume level btw) that as the story progresses and you begin to know facts about this strange outbreak you really want to keep playing to finally unveil the truth behind your mission, everything's surrounded with mystery even 'till the end. An Instant classic that you don't wanna miss out. Oh and don't forget to play on the highest difficulty, the game will get even better as you will appreciate your ammo and health packs to a higher degree, all this to achieve the ultimate survival experience.\n\nMy personal score 92/100","January 15, 2014","true","29.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I put many hours in and played the full story on each difficulty. DS1 is my favorite of the 3 DS games.\n\nPC dead space feels like a bummer because 1 minute of gameplay i get to the room where you obtain your first weapon and a bug prevents me from walking through the door. As explained on a couple cite-able resources, the game is poorly ported and can either have too much fps because vsync is off, or not enough fps because vsync is on.\n\nI wouldnt recommend this game because this issue has apparently been going on since this game was available for pc and takes troubleshooting to operate as expected.\n\nI will cite a couple sources to support this\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/17470/discussions/0/846962626952252891/\nhttp://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2671623\n","November 28, 2015","false","40.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

However I wasn't able to deal with the awkward feeling controls (even with mouse sensitivity up to max, and vsync off, turning seems a massive hassle, and strafe doesn't seem to work), or the way the character blocks most of the view.  Haven't played OTS view before, but I found the character stuck on the left too annoying.","December 23, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you don't have time to go dink around with your graphics card settings for a while (apparently, you want to disable vsync in-game and then fake it out by forcing vsync ON with the control panel for your card... and that still doesn't always work...) you may want to skip this.\n\nThe severity of the bugs you will encounter, if you encounter them, is surprising, as is how early you encounter them: literally, the third door you can open in the game.  It's pretty ridiculous.  Very bad port.\n","November 27, 2015","false","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
