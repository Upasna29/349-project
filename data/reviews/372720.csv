You could do Duolingo, FOR FREE, and have the same amount of words and vocabulary. Also, it does not assess what level you are from the get go so if you have any sort of experience you have to start as if you know nothing. It's pointless, don't buy it.","July 9, 2015","false","0.1"," 56 of 75 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","56","75","3","3"

What I like about The Language Game is that you can switch between languages quickly, and cross refence your data, and it also appears that you don't always have to be online to use it . Go ahead and blow 5 bucks if you want to spruce up your bardic tongue . Polish, Hindi, and Japanese would be nice options to add later - I'm hoping to see more downloadable content in the future .","July 9, 2015","true","0.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","21","22","0","2"

It is a great program if you want to start learning either Spanish, Italian, German, French, or English. Just keep in mind that it wont teach you an entire language. It does not teach you how to write or rules of grammar, just how to speak a few basic things. Never the less, it is a good way to start learning  a language. Of course, a language class will always be better than this, but this may be what motivates you to take those classes. For $5.00, its not too bad.","July 10, 2015","true","1.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","1"

It's like most other language apps but I was learning Italian and he was learning Spanish at the same time. The blockbusters thing seems really simple at first but it's actually quite tactical.\n\nIt's obviously a mobile port, but works pretty good on a laptop. Will take it with me on holiday and use it on the plane.\n\nCould use more languages, I'd like to see Japanese on here!","July 10, 2015","true","5.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","1"

I love the blockbusters part! What a way to gamify learning! Especially when doing something as difficult as learning an entirely new language - it's a great touch!\n\nThe UI is nice and easy to navigate, it's not too busy or noisy and allows for a pleasant learning experience. I have to learn French for my work because we've recently acquired an office in France and I'm finding this game really useful for picking up actual phrases that I'll need in real-world conversation.\n\nI'd recommend it if you want to learn a new language quickly. I think the fact that you can learn from and to several different languages and play two player is great! What better way to improve at a task than to challenge your buddy? And they don't even need to be learning the same language as you? Genius!","July 13, 2015","true","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Playing with my six year old kid ahead of a trip to Disneyland Paris and he loves it... honestly, seeing him enjoying learning like this is just a beautiful thing :) The language content is great and it gives good feedback. The UI is bit clunky because of the mobile origin but it's a minor setback, and it was a pretty cheap buy so yeah, overall I'm well pleased :)","August 4, 2015","true","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aestris/recommended/372720/","aestris","Aestris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aestris/","125 products in account","The Language Game is an "Educational" game meant to help you learn foreign languages, developed by Tap to Win. And let me tell you: I've just about had it with these developers.\n\nI am writing on behalf of myself and a few of my friends to state that dour muttonheads are responsible for the wayward, headlong tenor of Tap to Win's whinges. Let me get to the crux of the matter: Tap to Win dreams of a time when they'll be free to drive us into insolvency. That's the way it's planned it, and that's the way it'll happen—not may happen but will happen—if we don't interfere, if we don't raise several issues about its self-satisfied, uncongenial lamentations that are frequently missing from the drivel that masquerades for discourse on this topic. Tap to Win's ability to escape punishment for breaking up society's solidarity and cohesiveness honestly tells us one thing. It tells us that our passage to Perdition has been booked. I believe it also tells us that Tap to Win has always relied upon a divide-and-conquer strategy to maintain power. This strategy is aimed at keeping all of the world's exploited and oppressed people fighting against each other instead of uniting and fighting against their real enemy: Tap to Win.\n\nTap to Win presents one face to the public, a face that tells people what they want to hear. Then, in private, it devises new schemes to suck up to sick leguleians. We wouldn't currently have a problem with favoritism if it weren't for Tap to Win. Although it created the problem, aggravated the problem, and escalated the problem, Tap to Win insists that it can solve the problem if we just grant it more power. How naïve does it think we are? Truly, if you're not part of the solution then you're part of the problem. I'd like to finish with a quote from a private e-mail message sent to me by a close friend of mine: “Tap to Win is a myth-generating machine”.","November 10, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a bit extreme, so I can only recommend this to a complete beginner and when it is really cheap. So far, to me it has been a waste of money.","March 13","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They are OK, but not precise. So the game is not feasible for any kind of serious language learning beyond wanting to learn a few phrases for summer vacation.\n2: The quizes are trivial. You can quickly spot the right answer by ruling bad ones out. However, there are some phrases that are very alike, but have totally different meaning. These are not taken into account.\n3: There is zero progression, learning or revisioning plan. You just click what you want to learn. However, this way you will need to keep track of the topics you did not revise recently.\n\nHaving a free alternative, like duolingo or anki makes this program a total waste of time. Also, there are some issues with navigating as well, and the music is also irritating after few minutes.","January 3","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
