We are together for a review of another HOG again! How marvelously different and interesting, is it? No, of course it isn't. This is our millionth HOG, and after a while they all end up resembling one another. Still, Mountain Crime: Requital is one of the better ones out there, with an interesting enough scenario to establish a sense of curiosity.\n\nWe here have Dr. Philip White, who receives an urgent phone call in the middle of the night, which asks him to attend a patient at the White Wolf Mountain Resort, in a really bad storm. As any self-confident wise guy with no common sense spared, he travels to middle of nowhere to attend said patient, only to find a murder-mystery. All communication and transportation is cut off, hotel guests are dropping like flies and there is a sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the loose who treats all this chaos as an elaborate game. It seems that everything is connected to a bigger crime buried in the past. "But what crime?" asks Dr. Philip White, and starts his investigation like any Scooby Doo wannabe.\n\nCute, huh? Don't be deceived by my mockery. Our protagonist is a naive sod, but the story itself and the connection between hotel guests are a mystery worthy of uncovering. As for the game itself, graphics are pretty good. Background design is interesting and there are many, many lockboxes, automatons and hidden doors around. If I'd visit this hotel in real life - without a murder-mystery present, of course - I know I'd love to spare a week or two there. Character animations look pretty until they start talking. Then with the tongue-tied voice acting and clumsy lip synch, the atmosphere crumbles. It's like a really fine looking lady with no smarts. You'd love to look her all day, as long as she doesn't talk.\n\nPuzzles, I hear? Oh, they are good. There is a balanced combination of ordinary ones, and 'just annoying enough to stall you off until you were about to give up' ones. HOG scenes are very neat, with open and distinguishable items, with more than only one item of the kind lying around. Each HOG is designed to gather pieces for a machine of sort that you're trying to fix, so you can reach another item of use. This way, items laid around kinda make sense, which is rare in this genre.\n\nAll in all, this is a fine HOG, but I'll attach a warning. This game is included in a Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1 in Steam, so if you have the bundle already, there is no actual need for you to buy this game. You already have the game within the bundle. If you don't have it and are even mildly curious, go ahead. Gonna end up with 3-4 hours of decent HOG fun. With this said, my work here is done! Good gaming!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 2, 2015","true","4.4"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","0"

However, he's not here but the clients, all invited for the inauguration, are attacked one by one and killed. Everyone seems to be tied to an old fire that killed two children when the building was still a house for kids.... So why are you there?\n\nI must admit that I played the game in the Hidden Objects Bundle 5 in 1, that lazy as I am, I've not reviewed. Activating this game was part of making a better review of it as an stand-alone than a quick one for the bundle, because of the character limit. The trading cards are a bonus added later and so I replayed the game for them.\n\nNow, with memory refreshed, I remembered why I liked it, though the core gameplay isn't my favorite. Indeed, at first sight, you think that it's about two different stories: the death of Bill Wilton, a benefactor for the hospice, and the death of two children years later. In reality, everything is tied and everyone reunited, save for you as you had no influence in that fateful day, played a part directly or indirectly. The ending however is a huge twist.\n\nThe core gameplay is a scene with an object to rebuild and with the parts to find in it. It's not my favorite though, as some objects are hidden by the hud itself and that others are sometimes not in the same position as shown. You have also to solve puzzles to advance. While the map is useful to see where to go, it can't be used to travel, which is sad.\n\nThe backgrounds are good too, though you may ask yourself why there is a ski resort behind an old child hospice. It's making sense in the story. You'll also see that the hotel is renovated in only the parts used by the guest, the rest is left like that after the failure of the resort.\n\nThe soundtrack is good too though it's not too much present.\n\nAnyway, Mountain Crime: Requital is a nice game, I wish that I could see more of the story but hey, it has enough suspens for a sequel too. Maybe it's existing out there.\n","January 26","true","3.1"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Engaging, intriguing, heart pounding.  Keeps the gamer enthralled and guessing until the end.  I felt like I had read a thrilling murder mystery without actually any reading involved.  Excellent pacing with just enough time to almost catch your breath.\n\nStoryline: Dr. Philip White (one dark and dangerously stormy night) is called to the newly renovated White Wolf Hotel to examine and attend to a Mr. Grey.  When he arrives, the bridge washes out leaving him stranded.  He discovers there is no Mr. Grey and a hotel filled with other guests also invited to this grand opening by Mr. Grey.  (And Then There Were None ~ Agatha Christie, anyone?  And no that is not a spoiler.) The mystery begins when the body count begins.  Who is Mr Grey? Does he even exist?  Why are these people here, unknown to each other yet have a connection?  What is that connection?  And why this requital?  As the body count rises, the answers are revealed.\n\nGameplay:  Hidden Object puzzler with point and click elements.  The hidden object scenes instead of being find lists, are picture finds (somewhat like a silhouette).  The HO scene opens and small pictures form a circle of the things or pieces needed to be found.  Not as easy as it sounds since the objects needed to be found blend into the surrounding objects (which are appropriate for where the scene is).  For example looking for desk items, on a desk covered with items typically found on a desk.  Also there are generally several of the same item and like a matching game the gamer needs to pick the correct one.\n\nPuzzles: Sliders and logic, or maybe better stated: logic sliders.  For example the typical moving of X number of one color object to the opposite side of a board/grid while the x number on that side are moved to where the other color is.  Typically found on locks.  Also there is the finding of keys, which are usually found behind some type of logic slider puzzle.\n\nThe Point and Click element is just as important to the story and in true point and click fashion there are plenty of puzzling obstacles to overcome.  However this element is so intermixed with the Hidden Object aspect it is hard to tell the two apart.\n\nNote: No map (not needed), no penalties for game hints or puzzle skips.  No achievements but trading cards for those who care about those things.\n\nConclusion: Enthralling and believable murder mystery, and like all excellent murder mysteries when the pieces start to fall into place, it is an avalanche.  Definitely worth full price.","December 29, 2015","true","5.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","4"

Be advised. however, that it's also available on Steam as part of a package called Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1 and that's probably the better option for anyone who plays a lot of these.\n\n(My fondness for value bundles resulted in me having both the stand-alone and the 5-in-1 version, but Steam's review system required me to install and run the stand-alone for five minutes before I could post this review.  I understand how that helps to protect the integrity of reviews, but in this case it was just an aggravating hoop to jump through.)","October 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Then a storm hits and your car crashes leaving you stranded at the hotel. You'll meet lots of characters but honestly none of them matter since they all fall over dead like flies. The amount of murder in this game is just ridiculous. It honestly got to the point where I'd expect to find a dead body in every room. However, the story itself isn't bad but it quickly takes a predictable turn and the ending is down right hilarious. I laughed out loud at the end just shaking my head.\n\nOf course, the game doesn't intend to be funny. It takes itself seriously. The voice acting isn't perfect but it's passable. The graphics are dated but not hard on the eyes. The game play is where the game shines. I enjoy the hidden item scenes because you go into each one with a list of items to find that go together to form something actually useful. So no finding random gum wrappers or etched hearts. The mini games are very standard fare; sliding puzzles, memory puzzles, pipe puzzles, etc. They're fun but some are a bit vague when it comes to instructions.\n\nThe game lacks achievements which is a shame but it also makes playing the game more relaxing. It's an old game at a cheap price and a good one for fans of the genre. Though the story isn't amazing it's funny and I enjoy laughing while playing a good game. So I say you should buy it and give it a shot.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","November 11, 2015","true","7.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

(Seriously, imagine Saw, if the traps were designed by an idiot, and managed to ensnare even bigger idiots). There's a big mystery about an old resort where a bunch of kids burned alive that the hotel you're in was built on, but all in all the plot ranges from boring to hilarious, without any detours to interesting.\n\nThe hidden object scenes are okay. The main mechanic is you're searching for objects by a given silhouette (although sometimes the silhouette doesn't match with the item, so thanks, game). A few scenes are repeated, but at least they all have the gimmick of ostensibly using all the items you find to acquire the needed object to advance.\n\nThe regular puzzles are okay too. No real stand-outs; just typical HOG fare like "Slide the blocks around until the one block can escape", "Turn the pipes so the liquid can pass through", "There is a combination lock, but you saw the solution so it shows up in your journal", stuff like that.\n\nThere were a lot of cute little animals, including a prominent squirrel guy in one puzzle that had big ol' cutie ears. There was also a moment when the character you play as was standing next to an exploding gas stove and seemed completely unaffeted. The ending is hilarious.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game, and definitely worth a shot.","October 13, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

People start dropping like flies around you and you have to investigate and try to stop the killer before he runs out of victims. The plot is a bit of a mixed bag, a lot of it is shown in news clippings and details of the history of the hotel and all the people being killed who all seem linked back to an arson a couple of decades previously, so you have to race to uncover the identity of the killer. At one point there is the hint it might be an interesting denouement in the nature of identity/memento or some other psychological thriller, but in the end it feels more like a daytime soap plot (except for the body count).\n\nStill that part is okay enough to provide the background for the gameplay, so that breaks down into the hidden object scenes which are of the construct an item style of HOG, which is where you go all MacGyver and construct all sorts of items from things found in one place, so at one point you collect a safecracking kit (and then proceed to use the screwdriver to take the entire safe door off ignoring the rest of the kit you painstakingly searched for), some sort of miniflamethrower, a hot air balloon (because you didn't want to just lift/push the basket off the item you needed).\n\nWhile very inventive it all feels pretty bizarre (more so that normal for the genre even, which is pretty bad by and large). The imminent peril of people dying of snakebite, or being strapped into a chair at the mercy of the killer, and then you go around repairing a globe, or a piano, most often just to get common household tools - that you generally discard after one use so there can be another convoluted puzzle to get yet another screwdriver or whatever later in the story. You rarely get any explicit story hints of why you should be interacting with these objects, just they are the only things on the map which can be interacted with left, so that must be where the latest essential tool can be found.\n\nAnyway that gripe aside the scenes play fairly well and feel somewhat naturalistic, the puzzles also tend to be unexplained - I guess the hotel owner likes messing with his employees and forcing them to play puzzles to open doors and otherwise do their job. No wonder all the staff seem to have disappeared before the story starts. The puzzles themselves are mostly fairly easy, with a reasonable variety, but the controls are frequently wonky and things don't always move how you want them to - this even forced me to skip one puzzle as I couldn't move the piece far enough right to finish it. There were a couple I found more difficult but I think it is more down to me being bad at those types of puzzle (the 4 shape overlapping rotating puzzle right at the end being the main one). Of course with no achievements you can actually use the skip/hint buttons if you really get stuck without it forcing you to replay it later to get the last couple of achievements (and forcing you to find a way to do those puzzles or consult a walkthrough anyway).\n\nOverall it is a recommendation, especially given the price, but don't expect too much, it has a lot of flaws to go with the good points. Also I laughed out loud (literally) immediately after freeing the Senator from the chair - I don't think this is the intended reaction...anyone else do the same?","December 27, 2015","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But, upon arriving, you soon find out that something sinister is taking place at this sleepy residence.\n\nYou can compare the story to that of the 1980s film Clue, but with slightly darker undertones.\n\nNo, really, you play as a guy who goes into the middle of nowhere and everyone else (except for you) is a complete and utterly clueless fool. Murder in a big, beautiful mansion, the works.\n\nThe only difference is the fact that you're a beefy doctor with a penchant for solving puzzles and...Well, the cheesy ending; but the game is pretty fun to play so I won't spoil it for you!\n\n+\n\nI've played quite a number of HOGs and I was pleasantly surprised by the unique spin in this one.\n\nInstead of going through hidden object scenes full of stuff that has to be picked through to cross off a list, there's a ring of six or seven items that, once filled in after finding and dragging the items into the bubbled ring, will create or repair a useful tool or key item to progress the story - like a vacuum cleaner, blow torch, etc.\n\nThis aspect of the game alone was very refreshing and less time consuming compared to the repetitive formula that other HOGs use for gameplay.\n\nPuzzle-wise, though, I'm happy to say that there's a good variety to play with; though, I think more would've been appreciated because the HOG scenes can be a bit tiring after awhile.\n\nMy favorite aspect of the game was exploring; the hotel has a large number of rooms and each one has its own theme and unique charm. The hidden documents, weathered walls and furniture made me wonder just what kind of history the place had.\n\nSadly, I feel that the story was a bit too predictable and fell short of its potential towards the end; but it was really fun to play and the game is sold at a great bargain - so I got what I wanted.\n\nI'm not so sure if Mountain Crime has replay value, but I will say that this is something that HOG fans can enjoy.","January 1","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got a few hours of play for less than a dollar, though, so I'm not complaining too much!  The storyline kept me guessing on a couple of points, although the 'twist' of who the protagonist is became obvious fairly early.\n\nI enjoyed the puzzles, and most were not too difficult although I had to use some trial and error for a couple.  The hidden object scenes were a little different from most other games of this type that I've played - instead of working from a list, there is a 'wheel' of objects to find that will result in either putting together something you need, or causing something else to happen in the scene that reveals your objective (I did have to laugh at the hot air balloon!).  In most scenes there were several similar objects, so you had to find the right one - for example you need a glove, but there are a few gloves strewn around so which do you choose?  As far as I can tell there were no penalties for misclicks (and there are no achievements), so if you have trouble there's no harm in clicking all the gloves!\n\nAll in all, a fun game for the price although I would probably recommend picking it up at a discount if you can.","March 18","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a good game but left me with too many questions. play it anyways and see if you like it.","April 3","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
