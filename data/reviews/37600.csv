That's it. However, you really shouldn't see it as a game, but rather more as an interactive art piece. So take your time, relax, admire, and play.\n\nIt wonderfully succeeds in offering a pleasing and captivating experience to the player for a brief moment (it may take you only 15~30 minutes to finish).","November 25, 2013","true","2.4"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","40","42","0","0"

The objects react differently to your clicks, they surprise you with their reactions and discovering their meanings or roles is part of the fun of solving every puzzle. Putting it all together makes use of your creative thinking and seeing the picture in full is a very satisfying feeling.\n\nWhat I liked a lot about this game was the difficulty of the levels: they’re neither too simplistic, nor too challenging, just the right amount to keep you wanting to solve the puzzle by yourself while being tempted to check a guide. I personally didn’t need to check a guide and I managed to find the solution to every puzzle only after a few minutes of poking around. The solution was never obvious, but the puzzles are designed so that you’ll always figure it out.\n\nI think that this game would fit better on a touch screen device than on PC since it consists in a lot of experimenting with objects, clicking them or dragging them, and there’s no time limit or time requirement to solve the puzzles.\n\nAlthough it’s quite short (45 mins – 1h), Windosill is a wonderful and relaxing experience, and I think it’s worth the price.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","March 27, 2015","true","1.4"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","26","26","2","0"

It's cute and totally worth playing, but don't expect much more than a great free flash game.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics with nice interactable objects\nInteresting puzzles with unconventional logic that take some trial and error, but don't make you go running to look on guides\nManages to be fantastic, somewhat trippy, and still keep the puzzles to a sober level of difficulty\nCons:\nVery short--beat it in half an hour\nNo replay value\nAlmost no BGM\nBought on / for: I traded it for a spare bundle key/link I had. Although its price is low, considering the minutes of fun you get, it might be a bit expensive. But if you end up with it in your Library, either by getting it in a bundle, trade, or somewhere else, you should really play it!\n\nSimilar games: It kinda reminded me of those Grow games from EYEZMAZE[www.eyezmaze.com].","November 24, 2014","true","0.6"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","29","31","0","0"

A point and click puzzle game encompassing ten inordinately imaginative rooms, it's neither challenging nor lengthy, but in the same way a short picture book can be hugely delightful, Windosill succeeds because of its simple design and childish sensibilities.\n\nThere is not a whole lot more I could say about Vectorpark's bite-sized treat of a game, and hopefully I don't need to to convince you it's worth your time. It's a brief expedition (about 30 minutes, depending on how good you are at puzzle solving) to another world, full of strange sounds and bizarre creatures, that is entirely unassuming in its execution. A gorgeous artistic endeavor, it shows that sometimes all a game needs to be worthwhile is a clear vision and a lot of passion to back it up.\n\nIt's the sort of game that is effortlessly relaxing; best enjoyed curled up with a blanket next to the fire, sipping a cup of cocoa and just enjoying life.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 20, 2014","true","1.0"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"

It's not long, so it's a great time-filler when you just need something to relax with an occupy your brain for a little while, (insomnia, anyone??) and it's also good when you need something that you can pick up and put down at will; you don't have to worry that something will kill you. It's a great thing to have in your back pocket for those times when you're going stir crazy because you have to wait for something and need something short to occupy your time that you can put down in a hurry whenever it's time to do whatever it is (like go with your relatives that are all FINALLY ready. Yay family reunions.)\n\nThe puzzles are pretty engaging but you can figure them out without any hair pulling especially if you're an experienced puzzle solver. I didn't have to use any guides. Each level involves moving a car from one door on the left side of the room to the door on the right, which you have to unlock. Most of the objects you can click on do something, so it's fun to see what they'll do. I was disappointed that there weren't any achievements or anything at all, but I guess that's what you can expect for such a short game. Still it is a nice time filler and I'll keep it in mind if I need something short and relaxing.\n\n+ Positives:\n* Whimsical art\n* Engaging puzzles that require you to think outside the box--and sometimes even sideways!\n* Cute sound effects\n* Not too long\n* You can leave it without worry of dying (so it's safe to fall asleep. really! you can use this when you have insomnia. it's relaxing)\n* You can play with or without sound so as not to bother/wake others\n\n- Negatives\n* Some people really don't like Flash\n* Some of the puzzles really aren't intuitive\n* It's short. Really short. Especially if you're an experienced puzzle solver. I didn't even use any guides. I saw one picture in the forums, but it didn't help me solve anything. It was just a screenshot. I didn't count, but I think there are only ten levels or so.\n* It really isn't replayable unless you *really, REALLY* enjoyed it or want to wait a year or so until you forget most of it\n(that said you can use steam family share and let your family play it. oops, this should have gone under positives. oh well. It seemed to want to go here)\n*no achievements or Steam cards\n\nall in all, nice short game :) I'd get it in a game package deal or on sale.","July 27, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Considering the game is purely based on Flash the amount and realization of physics effects is quite impressive.\n\nUnfortunately, with an average playtime of around 30-40 minutes, the game is really short and doesn't really offer that much replay value. Once you've played through the game you can probably beat it in around 10 minutes or even less.\n\nSince it's a Flash game the game size is fairly small. The fully downloaded game just takes about 7.5 MB of HDD space, so atleast it isn't clogging up the HDD.\n\nBasically half of the game can be played at [> http://windosill.com/ <] for free, so if you want to try it out I suggest you play the free demo version and save your money for another Indie game, which offers a bit more bang for the buck.","January 2, 2012","true","0.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The look of it is like combining pieces of construction paper, and have it come to life.\n\nGameplay: The goal of each puzzle is coming across or producing a square that fits in the hole on top of the door, then being able to get your little cart through the door.  It's more of an interactive child's puzzle that gets harder overtime.\n\nControls: The controls are mostly based on your mouse. There are some annoying parts to it, as you have to drag something a certain way and it refuses to work with you. Overall, not too bad. It's just about the timing.\n\nWorth the price?: In all honesty, as short as it is, it isn't really worth 2.99 usd. To me, if any, it should be worth around a dollar or so. I recommend picking it up on a sale or in a bundle.\n\nOverall: Although the price is a bit steep for something so short, Windosill is a nice, relaxing, small game to play when you're stress or feel nostalgic about your childhood. This game can also be enjoyed with your kids or if a kid wants to play a game on your computer. This game is a win situation for all ages. For kids: their imagination and for adults: nostalgia and relaxing yourself.","March 16","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's hard to find anything to dislike, mostly because it's so brief, and while it's not deep, incredible or revolutionary, it harkens back to those Amanita style games that are content in being merely a short, pleasant experience with minimal gameplay elements, and that's fine by me.\n\nHighlights\nThe key to Windosill lies in the combination of the pleasant and absorbing animation, reminiscent of early Pixar works, and the incredibly smooth difficulty spike. They marry together for a soft, short and casual ride of discovery and intrigue which is best explained as simply pleasant.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nThere're no mistakes to speak of with this title, and the few things that are worth mentioning are incidental. While there may be a moment or two where you wont know how to progress, and might resort to simply repeating the same incorrect step a few times, I feel like this would have become more of a problem had the game grown longer, and as it stands the frustrating part(s) are negligible.\nThe main concern and criticism then, is the short length of play. Average completion time sits at less than an hour, and my second run through took me less than 10 minutes. Normally I'd dismiss this concern and state that the quality of the content and the price compensate, but it may be a genuine reason not to buy if you're on a budget or looking for something deeper. I feel it would've been very simple for the developer to add another layer of content, a difficultly mechanic, a few more levels or even something as simple as hidden collectables which would've added a reason to spend more time with the title.\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at £1.99/2.49€/$2.99 on Steam at the time of review, Windosill is worth looking out for, and the concerns about value for money in terms of length can be mitigated by waiting for a sale, but at $2.99 it's very worth picking up if you can let go of the play length.\n\nVector Park Inc. also have a number of demos available on their website[vectorpark.com], playable directly from your browser which are well worth checking out, including the entire first half of Windosill.\n\nUnedited review notes 24/08/2015 for Windosill\n\n+Strange style without forced "weirdness"\n+Genuinely pleasant\n-Too short, even at the low price\n+First half of game available free, could be seen as a bad thing, personally find it an awesome move\n+Only one annoying/frustrating part, important for this style of game\n+The character isn't the central part of the game\n-Secrets/extras would've went a long way in this game, perhaps for backtracking","September 1, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What does that say about me? I have not matured? I like to touch things? I like to molest everything on screen with my hands? Should I check myself in for a psychiatric exam? Should I try out for the ink block what do you see here test?\n\nIn all seriousness this game from these people http://vectorpark.com/ is all about exploring the enjoyment and wonder which can be had from the world of touch and discovery. As adults we often forget the excitment which can be had through  innocent experimentation of poke and prod.\n\nThe game has one of the stangest beginnings I have ever had in a game, especially since it doesn't actuallly tell you what you need to do, but that's half the fun of this gem. In fact it was only when I discovered the other room by accident, that the magic of this short ten room adventure began to sink in. While to some people the little accompanying toy car might seem like the main hero of this story, in actuality what really makes this flash based game come to life is you and how you choose to explore and solve how to move your toy car to the next room.\n\nA short pure childlike Toy Car adventure to infinity and beyond.\n\nThankyou devs for making a game which knocked many years off my age...","December 30, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You can beat it in about 30 minutes, give or take (depending on how clever you are).\n\nThat being said, it is an extremely imaginative point-and-click puzzle game. In some ways it feels similar to Myst games in that you are presented with weird objects that do things when you interact with them, but you don't know what the objects are, and it's not clear at first why these objects do these things or what purpose it could possibly serve. So you just sort of tinker around with what you see until all of a sudden something clicks.\n\nAt the same time, this game is sort of unlike a lot of puzzles and point-and-click games in that there are all kinds of superfluous interactions with objects you can have for no reason other than to engage your imagination and wonder. In that way it sort of reminds me of the old Living Books series (ask your parents) where you could click on a bunch of things in a scene and random things would happen for no particular reason. It was just fun to find them and watch them.\n\nA cool little game, but really very short.","June 13, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Windosill's aim is to inspire in the player a child-like wonder and sense of discovery (Smith, 2009), presenting him with an interactive world made by a series of rooms that can be progressed by resolving very simple point-and-click puzzles. However, those puzzle, while being the core element of the "gameplay", are not Windosill's main interactive focus. In fact the game is much more oriented on immersing the player in its abstract world. This aim is reflected by the puzzle design that, if on one hand is very simplistic, on the other forces the player to explore the environments and to interact with every element that he can see, since the abstract nature of the game makes it practically impossible to quickly resolve the puzzles on the first try. The absence of the need for complex reasoning is also another element that helps the player focusing on enjoying the world and the experience [...]\n\nFull Article: http://www.scriptaludica.com/","September 22, 2014","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a refreshingly simple and beautiful game about a little blue train that dares to journey from its place on the shelf. In each room it enters, it must somehow find a cube used to open the door to the next room. The puzzles make you think very creatively, doing things you don't normally do in a game. The graphics and art are gorgeous and you can tell the developer has paid attention to every tiny detail, because almost every object can be clicked and interacted with. The first time I did it, it took roughly an hour, and it has good replayability because you can time yourself and try to beat your best time.

You'll be spending half your time poking at the scenery to find out what delightful bit of interactivity is hiding under your cursor. It's not long, but it doesn't have to be: I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my playthrough.\n\nAs a programmer, what really amazes me about this game is that it doesn't use 3D acceleration. Instead of being composed of triangles in 3D space, every single object in this game (to my knowledge) is defined by basic shapes and vectors in 2D space. You might think that this would be a detriment, but instead it allows the game to produce fluid, smooth, and very organic looking effects that would be almost impossible to with traditional 3D graphics. If you're as interested in this as I am, get the iPad version instead: once you've beaten the game, you can play through in wireframe mode and check out the way it's put together.","April 25, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a refreshingly simple and beautiful game about a little blue train that dares to journey from its place on the shelf. In each room it enters, it must somehow find a cube used to open the door to the next room. The puzzles make you think very creatively, doing things you don't normally do in a game. The graphics and art are gorgeous and you can tell the developer has paid attention to every tiny detail, because almost every object can be clicked and interacted with. The first time I did it, it took roughly an hour, and it has good replayability because you can time yourself and try to beat your best time. Overall, I enjoyed Windosill very much, and for the price (especially if you buy it from the Humble Store for $.99), you can't go wrong.","January 25, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can say that it's point'n'click adventure, but actually it's a short toybox, so to say. You can check out demo at Windosill site, which is half of  a game.\n\nNow, game only has 10 or so rooms (screens). Objective of which is to find a cube to unlock door and get wagon through door. Puzzles aren't compilated or hardcore and game will take maximum half-hour to beat with no real replaybility.\n\nAnd I probably should not recommend this game due to being so short and not gamey, but it's a little curiousity. A toy box. Using mouse, you get to interact with various objects. Game is quite calming experience, yet not complete bore. There is no music, just simple sounds. I also found animation and physics quite impressive for Flash game, lovely. Most memoriable screen was room with three creatures, each one taking interest in interacting with your toy wagon.\n\nStill no idea to who I can recommend this at all, but it's a little curious thing.","May 3, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll be spending half your time poking at the scenery to find out what delightful bit of interactivity is hiding under your cursor. It's not long, but it doesn't have to be: I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my playthrough.\n\nAs a programmer, what really amazes me about this game is that it doesn't use 3D acceleration. Instead of being composed of triangles in 3D space, every single object in this game (to my knowledge) is defined by basic shapes and vectors in 2D space. You might think that this would be a detriment, but instead it allows the game to produce fluid, smooth, and very organic looking effects that would be almost impossible to with traditional 3D graphics. If you're as interested in this as I am, get the iPad version instead: once you've beaten the game, you can play through in wireframe mode and check out the way it's put together.","April 25, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as this little car thing and you try to get to the next area.

When you roll in, the large eyed monster gently rolls your car back and forth, then towards the smaller one. The smaller one picks it up and rolls the wheels on the ground and rolls it to the last monster which picks it up with it's mouth and throws it around back to the first.

Each level centres around finding a small box, using it to open a door, and getting your little toy train character through the door. Playing levels mainly goes like this:\n"Ah what a pretty place! Let me just poke some things and see what they do."\n"Heehee that's adorable. <3"\n"Okay let's do the puzzle."\n"I don't understand the puzzle!"\n"Ah okay that's how you do it. Let's poke some more things!"\n"I've poked everything there is to poke. Onwards!"\n\nIf you like colourful, fairly simplistic puzzles and enjoy playing with your environment, then you might like this game. It really benefits from not being too fussed about finishing the level in record time or whatever, but being more interested in looking around and enjoying yourself, while incidentally progressing from level to level.","May 28, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/37600/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","CLICK ON EVERYTHING!!!\n\nThe greatest pleasure of this game is discovery. I don't remember what it was like going to play school when I was a wee baby LeSauve, what it was like to learn that the crayons belong inside the lines on a book and not up my nose, or how it felt to play with a small, wooden block and try to force it into a round hole. But I can easily imagine the playful wonder and curiosity of this game comes pretty damn close to replicating those days.\n\nThis is adult playtime in the form of a small Flash game, where every object demands to be interacted with as you click and drag and poke and prod at everything to find out what it does and how it works. Often you'll find it doesn't really do anything of significance, but that's not the point. The point is the FUN of seeing a mechanism in action, secondary to then trying to figure out if you can use it in any way to progress further. The real goal they ask of you is to acquire a cube on each screen which acts as a key to a door to allow your little toy vehicle to pass through and onto the next screen. There's only ten screens, and the whole thing shouldn't trouble you for much more than half an hour, but in that short time there's still plenty of spectacle to marvel at as almost everything seems so foreign and alien from what you're normally used to, but will still ultimately make you smile as you discover something new and delightful... just like the wonderment of that first day in play school.","January 8, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
