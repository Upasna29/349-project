You can't move the links at all, all you can do is flip them between NS and EW orientation.  I played the heck out of Chainz back in the old days when Popcap didn't suck.\n\nI'd give this a thumbs up for pure gameplay for 99 cents, but unfortunately this is so old it's a major chore to get running on my current machine with modern drivers - getting it to keep focus is a real pain. And it only runs at 640x480.\n\nIt's CERTAINLY no longer worth anywhere near the $10 being asked for it.  99 cents max.","February 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You got a few different modes like time attack, arcade, strategy & puzzle mode. It's not a bad clone but doesn't really do anything different and I can't recommend it for the current price.","November 25, 2014","false","1.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Rotate the colored links to make matches of three or more in Classic Mode. Pit your link-matching skills against the clock in Arcade Mode. Ponder every precious move in Strategy Mode. Twist your brain and clear all the links in Puzzle Mode. Add in awesome sound effects, a zippy new music score, and sensationally updated visuals, and Chainz 2: Relinked is sure to keep you chained to your seat!","November 30, 2013","true","40.5"," 9 of 36 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","9","36","0","0"
