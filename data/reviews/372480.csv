This is a "HD" re-release with some graphical advancements and bug fixes in contrast to the original game, but I personally can't witness those fixes since I didn't play the original one.\n\nSo, what it is about? In short, it's an old-school homage to Elite-style of titles, where you can play in two game modes: Story or Free. In Story mode you have to follow the main quests, but honestly I didn't play much of that. I sticked with the Free mode, because in this mode you can go wherever you want, trade, fight, explore and generally do whatever you want. But, it has a steep learning curve, so you'll have to learn the basics. The lack of the official tutorial might be a minus for some folks, but there is a beginner's guide available.\n\nI'll try to break it down with "pluses" and "minuses":\n\n+ Open-ended Elite-like space sim\n+ Two game modes (Story Mode and Free Mode)\n+ Crapload of sidequests\n+ Good gameplay mechanics\n+ Solid graphics\n+ Awesome music\n+ If you like Elite, you'll dig this\n\n- Lack of tutorial (there is a beginner's guide available)\n- Just a partial gamepad support, but you can configure the buttons\n\nI liked it and I'm still playing it.\n\n8/10","May 31, 2015","true","8.0"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","1"

It's  a little bit dated but it has a lot going for it.  The graphics are very nice on max settings.  The atmosphere really nails it.  There are things Elite Dangerous could learn from this game.  My only complaints so far in my couple hours with it are that I wish it had full HOTAS control and that they would update the bad voice acting.  Other than that it seems quite enjoyable much like Evechron Mercenary.  A small item they could fix also would be the ability to look left and right inside your cockpit.  No complaints here for 10 bucks.  I hope they make a Spaceforce Rogue Universe 2 or an expansion.

As ever with games of this ilk it derives a lot of its gameplay from a rather popular and famous space combat and trading game, namely, Elite. This, in my opinion, is where the game may fall down to those who do not give it enough of a chance. Back in 2007 there was no new Elite game, there were Elite ‘clones’ dropping like flies and have been and no doubt will continue to be for many years to come. Spaceforce appears at first to be yet another one of those clones destined to drop by the wayside of its bigger and arguably better brother, Elite Dangerous. With that said there is something to offer here for those with and without the new Elite experience.\n\nLet me deal with the HD in the title before I go any further. This is a pretty game in the sense that it is a eight year old game with sharper resolutions. It runs smoothly on older systems and as the title implies it will happily run at 1080p with everything turned on. Now, no, it does not look as good as Elite Dangerous, nor should we ever expect it too but for those interested in the game this will matter less than you think.\n\nSpaceforce: Rogue Universe HD is about missions, in this it has more in common with another staple classic of the genre, Wing Commander. You choose a mission, you head to the jumpgate and jump through, complete the mission and head back or dock and repeat to fade. Elite was always more about exploration and trade and whilst you can do those things in Spaceforce it feels as if you are not really meant to.\n\nAs it stands, Spaceforce: Rogue Universe HD is a very competent, combat heavy, mission based RPG that, if you are a fan of this genre, you would be silly to ignore. It is priced perfectly, as a game that whilst never intended to be a triple A title or compete with its more complete brethren will give you many hours, weeks and months of fun. Yes, it can be repetitive but then again the same can be said of Elite Dangerous and some of us enjoy that repetition because it is safe, because we can master it and then beat it.","June 4, 2015","true","3.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

If you like space sims, without too much clunky redsource management give it a shot.\nIt's pretty good to see ships pulling off 180's turns to face you in combat while maintaining their forward momentum, instead of banking and turning like they're fighter jets.\nThe combat for me is very very satisfying.\n\nYou have several starting classes\n\nMy only issue with it for now is the textures might be a bit low res and show their age as being a 2007 game, not helped by the bump mapping that seems to be applied to every texture, kind of gives a weird effect when not only things that should be 3D are raised, like ships seams and rivets and the like, but also the paint work on ships, e.g one ship has a Shark face type of paint job like fighter planes of world war 2, and the details on it are raised which makes it feel like the image is molded into the ships hull.\n\nIt is a little jarring as the models themselves are nicely detailed. Kind of feels like a mix bag graphically.\nEspecally as the Planets textures look rather low res and blocky compared to the smaller items like Meteors, Ships and stations and I'll honestly admit not what I'd expect from a 'HD' remake. Although lighting and other effects like warping are top notch.\n\nBut it's a minor grip if gameplay is king for you.\n\nI feel the textures could be easily doubled in size as the files seem to be standard .dds with .tga normal maps.\nGoing to have a shot at making a texture pack myself once I can work out how to make textures larger and get them to work in the game.\n\nDevs seem to still be active and replies on the forums which is a good thing.\n\nAgain if you like good space game grab it, gameplay wise it is solid and will kill a lot of hours once you get into it.\nI've got a few other games to complete at this point, but once done I'll definitely be giving this one a lot of attention.\nI wish more games like this were being made.","June 10, 2015","true","5.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsjortloff/recommended/372480/","jpsjortloff","[JPS] jortloff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsjortloff/","656 products in account","\n\n\nThere's something about open-world space simulators that is inherently appealing to me.  That's why I think I was more forgiving of Spaceforce Rogue Universe HD from Dreamatrix Game Studios despite having a number of issues with it when it came to stability and execution.\n\nThe game itself may be showing its age, but the transformation to HD has helped considerably.  While the cut-scenes look dated and pixelated, the in flight models are attractive, and the backgrounds are just filled with interesting things to look at.  Ship and creature design are both intriguing and weapons look powerful, if not exotic.  What really impressed me were the explosions, with cool looking shock waves and flying debris, and the incredible reflections and distorted images in the cockpit view.  The visuals were aided by a good soundtrack and sound effects.  Unfortunately, the already weak cut-scenes were hampered further by absolutely dreadful voice acting.  It's actually hard to fully fault the acting, however, because so much of the dialogue was ham-fisted or downright schlocky.  It's a shame because it's clear the team was trying to tell a heart-wrenching story about family and the horrors of war, but I found myself wanting to skip over it and just continue flying around performing tasks.\n\nFlying around in Spaceforce Rogue Universe HD is fun, but it takes FAR too much setup to get everything working properly, and the game has bugs aplenty.  First off there is only partial joystick/controller support, which is frankly unacceptable for a spaceflight game.  It's annoying watching enemy craft pull off maneuvers you can only dream of because you need one hand on a joystick for pitch and yaw and one on the keyboard to handle roll, which makes dogfighting more awkward than it should be.  Sure, once you get the hang of things, it becomes easier, but flight never feels second nature the way it does is something like the Evochron games.  Couple this awkwardness with a glitch that prevented me from firing weapons with my first craft (which later solved itself-  I don't know whether the Logitech profiler was acting up or if the game itself was glitchy), and I nearly stopped playing right out of the gate.  It also doesn't help that the tutorial is inadequate, and there are no button prompts for actions.  I like that the game used context sensitive icons to denote things like docking and initiating trade with various crafts, but it would have been nice for it to also tell me in flight that I needed to hit Enter to perform those actions, or which buttons I needed to jump to a station or wormhole rather than making me consult a guide.\n\nThere's a LOT to do in this universe, and I liked the freedom the game gave me to explore/fight/trade/pursue the story as I went along.  Unfortunately, that freedom came with a price.  While trading itself was fairly straightforward, equipping weapons/upgrading my ship's systems was more problematic.  I was able to figure it out, and the system is fairly intuitive once you know what you're doing, but again, it would be nice to have the basics covered in-game.  It also would have been nice to know what weapons/systems I could install immediately on my ship and which ones required me to upgrade my systems first.  I could always sell back items for full credit, but it wasted time when a simple heads-up display of usable items could have been implemented.\n\nMissions themselves are plentiful and easy to find, but it wasn't always easy to determine just how difficult a mission was.  It was nice to see that enemies had a level ascribed to them and that missions were apparently color-coded for ease of completion, but I often found myself hopelessly outclassed by enemies I thought I could defeat.  Between not being able to remember (or properly execute) commands due to the incomplete controller support, and the ability of my enemy to absorb simply ludicrous amounts of damage, it made flying missions seem like something I should wait on.  I'd rather have the choice of whether I want to be a soldier or a trader, and not have the game feel like it's making me perform actions I don't want (mining, etc.) just so I can level up.\n\nThe weird thing is, despite everything I said above, I'm still somehow enamored with Spaceforce Rogue Universe HD.  The universe is immense, there's a lot of bang for the buck, and flying can be enjoyable once you work out the quirks.  Do I think it's worth the full price?  Potentially, if the team is able to patch the rough edges.  The game is still charming in its own right, and worth playing, but you will want to either wait for a sale (or patches) and bring plenty of patience.\n","July 5, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But that's not really a big deal. The game offers freeplay mode and it is much prefered. With all the exploration the game gives you, you don't really care to follow the generic naive-hero plot. Another problem the story presents is that the difficulty ramps up immensely. The first mission isn't so bad but I had to grind out ship upgrades and weapons for a solid 3 hours before attempting the second mission.\n\nGraphics - It was made in 2007 so I can't say much here. Honestly it doesn't bother me and since you're in space 99% of the time anyway, the only graphics you should be focused on is the background. Fights are usually so chaotic that you don't notice the dated textures anyway. For 2007 not bad though by today's standards it certainly is dated... Which is strange considering "HD" is in the title\n\nAudio - Laughably bad. The voice acting is cheesy and not in a good way. Characters constantly repeat the same damn lines over and over and over and over and over and over and there is no button to turn them off from what I've seen. Surely the devs would have come to their senses and said to themselves - "Man, our audio is abyssmal, lets add in a feature that turns off voices". But surprisingly they didn't. The rest of the audio sounds like stock sound effects and random pew-pews etc. It sounds very 1998 Starcraft-like. The only Voice acting that is cheesy in a good way is the Ord.\n\nGameplay - Boring. I spent 7 out of my 8 hours just mining asteroids because the game starts you off in such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state that you have no option but to grind out upgrades and wepons just to find a single lowly ship (Which, by the way even with many missiles takes up to 10 minutes to kill). Don't bother fighting more than 1 enemy, you'll die, a lot. Because of this, you're stuck in the first two or three sectors going back and forth mining asteroids and doing the crappy fetch-quest missions of 'repair the satellite' because you can't fight in your tincan ship. Whatever more advanced combat in this game exists, I don't care. It's not worth spending another 10 hours getting to level 3. Yeah, I spent 8 hours going from level 1 to level 2... and most of the enemies start off at level 4. Enjoy your MMO grinding.\n\nOver-all - I see the potential, I really do. It has some interesting civilizations, but they never interact beyond a random dogfight here and there (Don't rely on your allies to help you kill bad guys). The exploration is fun, but you aren't allowed to explore a whole lot because of the grind etc. Over all not even worth the 3 dollars I spent on it and I was excited at first. I thought it was amazing but the deeper I dug the more I noticed the smell....","June 14, 2015","false","15.7"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

They would have looked stunning... late 90s, early 2000... maybe. But I remember a game called Freelancer (Chris Roberts) and it's graphics were/are far superior and that was made back in 2003. It says HD... but it's not. The screen shots provided make it look so much better than it is. Which is a real let down during the golden age of retro gaming you'd think if they were honest the players wou;d be far more forgiving esp. the older generations that played Wing Commander back in the day.\n\nThe opening cinematic was so bad(graphics/plot/audio) I can't help but think it was a test and they just went with it.\n\nAudio: The Sound design=Horrible. The voice acting is the worst I've heard in a long time. I would have preferred none but it seems you get half and half. The brief tutorial you get are silent with your "Cortana" telling you to press the 'Dock' key or the 'Teleport' key... you'd think since they are doing text their allow user-defined but nope.\nThe music is barely noticable, the sound effects for collision and fire of your laser cannons (pew pew) is just bad. I would have preferred the silence in space than what was provided.\n\nGameplay: This is the worst part of the game. The controls are unintuitive, all over the keyboard, make no sense and the only decent thing is allowing joystick control (who has one of those there days?).\nThe menus are annoying to navigate as they do a 5 second slow fade to black and back again. There is NO tutorial. None. just go fly... good luck. You accidently shoot friendlies so many times in the early stages of the game you may as well just be a pirate to start with.\n\nThe starting packages do include pirate as well as soldier, scientist, adventurer, hunter, spy, the third nut of the pop and don't forget your mum. They don't do much except give you a slight advantage in a few minor things otherwise there is no customising your character. You are Ace Pretty Boy with Dead Eyes in search of your sister.\n\nDon't buy this. If you like space sims. Like really love them. As it you sneak off for quick space hyper jumps whenever you can... still do not buy this game. I really wish it was good... seems like it could have been a new Privateer style game... but it isn't.\n\nR.I.P.

It is impossible to dock to any station or trade with any trade ship, so you have no chance to purchase and mount some weapons. And what is totally irritating is your ship AI which says you each minute that your ship is damaged and need to be repaired (but your ship hull is on 100%). If you run benchmark test in-game, you will hear this message each minute even there. Now we can add total absence of any tutorial, in fact there are just some hints like: "to spead up pres the SPEED UP button", without information about what key or button is it (so you must hit ESC and look to the controlls menu). So this is another unplayable game from that incompetent people from Dreamatrix.","July 2, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"
