Love the humour, the creatures and minions. And when I learned about this game, I was thrilled! A new dungeon keeper?! Awesome! And when I first started playing, I was happy as the nostalgia washed over me...\n\nThe thing is, this isn't 'Dungeon Keeper 3.0'. Its not even 'Dungeon Keeper 2.5'. Its 'What if we remade Dungeon Keeper 2 with new graphics and new names/creatures so we don't get sued'.\nThis, in itself, IS NOT A BAD THING. But if you played DK2 to death, as i did, then you will notice that it tries to be more of the same, and it doesn't always succeed.\n\n\nI do heartily recommend this game, as it was fun whilst it kept my attention (almost 9 hours). But it did only feel like I was only adding to the hundreds of hours I'd already put into DK1 + 2 - and as such, It was just more of the same for me. At the end of the day, it replicates the originals so well/much, that I may as well be playing the originals - something I haven't had the urge to do in 15 years. Yes, there are new mechanics added, but its like saying that adding a 'go faster stripe' to a car changes the car; It doesn't.\n\n\nConclusion\n- If you've never played the originals, and think you might enjoy this, give it a go.\n- If you tried playing the originals, enjoyed it but the outdated graphics ruined it for ya, give this a go.\n- If you played the originals when they came out, loved them, and want more, give this a go.\n- If, however, you played the originals and want something MORE than an almost 20 year old game with a fresh lick of paint (however awesome it was) - might wanna give this a miss.","December 5, 2015","true","8.7"," 288 of 309 people (93%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","93","288","309","29","6"

However, now I actually can. After its' 1.1 patch, the majority of what this game was missing in its release verison has finally been added.\n\nWar for the Overworld, as a game, is...dungeon keeper 3. There really isn't another way to describe it. If Peter Molyneaux and the Bullfrog team were still around today, I feel the game we would have gotten would not be too far off from this. Are there flaws in this game? Obviously. Every game has flaws. But as far as managing to capture the feel of dungeon keeper and make an all-round fun game, this kickstarter title succeeds where higher-budget games such as the Dungeons series failed. With EA making no attempt to actually capitalize on a once great series, and in fact ruining it for a new generation by slamming a free to play business model that shames the series GREATLY (even paying off reviewers EA style couldn't keep dungeon keeper mobile's critic rating up high enough to appear worthwhile), it's nice to see we still have fans of the old game out there who want to see it made new.\n\nAm I rambling a lot on what Dungeon Keeper was? Yep. For those of you unfamiliar with what I'm talking about, this is a game where you manage a...well, dungeon, from the perspective of an evil overlord. Throughout the campaign, rather than being the hero who explores and brings death to dungeons, you build the dungeon and fight back against the good. You can accomplish this through the use of powerful minions as well as various traps and such that your enemy won't (hopefully) see coming, and of course a little bit of god power for good measure (*zap*). You have minimal control over your minions, so this isn't exactly an RTS and it sure as all hell is NOT an actions per minute game - in fact, trying to go all MLG clicky-clicky on this game would likely just hinder you more than anything else. Your control consists of picking minions or imps up and throwing them where you want them to be and...well, hoping they do what you want. You can lay down rally flags to get everyone's attention to a specific spot, but if you try to keep them out for too long you'll end up with a bunch of unhappy minions telling the flag to ♥♥♥♥ off and going to bed. You also have to keep them regularly paid with gold, which handily is also the resource you use for literally everything else. Fail in this aspect, and minions will just pack up shop and leave to go elsewhere.\n\nMap design is what made Dungeon Keeper and, as a result, War for the Overworld, extremely unique. There is not a lot of map when you actually get in - it's just a bunch of dirt, some impenetrable rocks, water, lava, maybe a chasm, and gold in the dirt. Oh, and your central dungeon core. Don't lose that...seriously. You have to dig out your own map, tile by tile, and lay down rooms in areas to correspond with what you want and your minions' needs - a lair to sleep, a slaughterpen to eat, a tavern to provide money for you and make people happy, a barracks to train, etc...and of course the arena where you can have minions fight to the death for no reason outside of entertainment. It appears to entertain the other minions to watch their brethren get slaughtered too...and of course, the other benefit to building your own map is deciding when and where to dig to place down traps and such, and if you happen to sight enemy traps...you can dig around them.\n\nBy now you may think this is a twisted, evil game where everything is gruesome and terrible. And you'd be right and wrong. While you do play as evil, this is a very lighthearted game as the original dungeon keeper games were. Featuring awesome voice narration from the original DK's narrator, you'll find yourself often having a lot of fun just from hearing some of the things minions have to say, or the random (but amusing) pop culture references made by the narrator.\n\nAnd when you're done with the campaign, you'll find it is still very fun to play in skirmish or multiplayer modes. In these modes, you and up to 3 other AI or players will duke it out, each building their own dungeons and attacking one another for no reason other than ♥♥♥♥ you, my ground. Unlike the original dungeon keeper, War for the Overworld actually does a decent job of working properly in skirmish and multiplayer. While it was possible in Dungeon Keeper 2 to do the same, the game just didn't quite feel the same as it was very campaign-oriented. WFTO implements some new systems that help the game to work properly in either situation. There is also sandbox mode where you just build in a big, empty map free of gold or mana issues, and survival mode which is...honestly still being worked on and I have very little experience in it, but it's self explanatory.\n\nOverall, this game is easily worth your $30. Hell, go the extra $10 and get the $40 version just for the soundtrack if nothing else - the soundtrack is pure evil and outstanding and it fits PERFECTLY with a game of this theme. This kickstarted game more than deserves your money (after a rocky launch).\n\nGET DIS GAME","June 10, 2015","true","20.6"," 302 of 333 people (91%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","91","302","333","30","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/230190/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2595 products in account","This is the dungeon keeper clone that we've been waiting for!\nWar for the Overworld is an attempt at creating a modern Dungeon Keeper. For those who are not familiar with Dungeon Keeper, it was a game released in 1997, where you played an evil dungeon overlord. You would build a dungeon with different  rooms that attracted different creature types, and you would use those to fight the heroes of the land and rival dungeons. Controls were indirect, you could not give orders to individual creatures, but you could pick them up and move them about, and you could use other means to make your creatures go where you wanted them to go, but unlike a regular RTS, you could not give direct orders. You could also not recruit specific creatures, but instead creatures would be drawn to your dungeon based on what was in it. War for the Overworld does not change any of this. At its core, it's basically Dungeon Keeper with a fresh coat of paint.\nSeveral attempts have been made in the past to make a "modern Dungeon Keeper", but most of them have, quite frankly, not been very good. As this game is so similar to Dungeon Keeper, there will be a lot of comparisons between the two.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nThe graphics in War for the Overworld is actually quite good for an indie game. The models are detailed enough, and the textures are also relatively detailed. It won't rival the latest AAA games, but as long as you don't expect that, it won't disappoint. The game also has a very cohesive art style, nothing looks out of place, despite the different creatures looking radically different from each other. One thing I would complain about is the game being a bit too dark. It's not a major issue, and a dungeon should be dark, but some more light would have made the game look more pleasing.\nThe sound felt a bit weak. Nothing had much impact, and you don't get enough feedback from the sound to really feel like you're doing things. It's nothing game breaking, but it is one of the areas in which the game could stand to be improved.\n\nStory\nThe story in this game is nothing to write home about. You're awoken and told about the emperor of the land, and that you should go and kill him. There's a bit more to it, but that's basically all you need to know. The story is basically just an excuse for "go kill good guys".\nWhere Dungeon Keeper 1 played up the contrast between the good guys and the bad guys (that is, you and your creatures) for comedic effect, War for the Overworld plays it more straight, similar to how Dungeon Keeper 2 did it. Which one is better is a matter of taste, but I preferred Dungeon Keeper 1. The game is not devoid of humor, but it's not as much of it as in DK1.\n\nGameplay\nAs mentioned above, War for the Overworld plays very similar to Dungeon Keeper. Build your dungeon, attract the creatures you want, and then attack. Everything feels a bit faster in War for the Overworld than it did in Dungeon Keeper. Your creatures level up faster in the training room, claiming land feels faster and so on. I would say that this is an improvement. Unlike Dungeon Keeper, where you had to research the "Call to Arms" spell in order to attract your creatures to a certain point on the map, you have access to a similar thing right from the get-go in War for the Overworld.\nGoing into enemy territory is a bit more dangerous than you might expect. You can't pick up creatures that are not on your territory, so if one is in danger, you'll have to use magic to save it, and hope that it is able to make it out of there on its own. And the game encourages you to use your magic liberally. You have a separate mana pool, and it is refilled quite fast, so using spells in combat is almost a must.\nCreatures are also handled differently than in Dungeon Keeper. Now you have two broad categories that can basically be seen as intelligent creatures and animals. Intelligent creatures will be this games counterparts to goblins, warlocks, trolls and so on, while animals will be things like giant spiders and other more animal-like beings. Intelligent creatures requires regular pay, can work in different rooms, and can use your training room. Animals will wander about, and the only rooms they can use is the portal that attracts them (you need to build this one, while the portal that attracts intelligent creatures is already on the map), an arena (this is how you level them up outside of combat, but they are damaged in the process) and the room they get their food from.\nIf the game has one flaw, it is its difficulty, or lack thereof. While Dungeon Keeper was not a hard game, the only way you would realistically lose in that game was if you ran out of gold, War for the Overworld is even easier, giving you plenty of gold to spend, and far less to spend it on (training creatures, for an example, is free). Gold is used to build new rooms, and when it's payday (at which point all your intelligent creatures will go to the nearest treasury and take some money). Not once during the campaign did it feel like I was running short on cash.\n\nFinal thoughts\nWar for the Overworld is a really good game. It sticks really close to the Dungeon Keeper formula, but does a few things to speed up the gameplay. Is it better than Dungeon Keeper? Well, that's a matter of taste. I would have an easier time recommending this game, but due to nostalgia, I still think I like Dungeon Keeper a bit more. But anyone who wants to play a game like Dungeon Keeper, or who want an interesting take on the RTS genre should check it out. Just beware that the game still has some bugs (nothing game breaking, but they were common enough to be annoying).\n","April 28","true","11.4"," 85 of 89 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","85","89","0","0"

There was literally nothing else like it. Nothing that blended strategy, simulation, humor, god-like abilities quite like it could. Over the years, I have wished for a game that was at least similar. Something that could tap into that magic a little bit.\n\nI heard about War for the Overworld when my heart was breaking over the bullcrap EA pulled with the Dungeon Keeper mobile game (I don't own a cell phone, but if that game had been good, I would have probably bought one just for that, haha). Some dude mentioned it in the comments of an article about EA's latest mistake, and I flew over to Steam to find it (figuratively speaking, of course). I finally tried it today, and I have to say, I am surprisingly shocked as to how well they're pulling it off.\n\nThis game captures that DK essence. This game is made by people who are as obsessed with the masterpieces that are DK and DK2 as I am. The developers have put their hearts and souls into this game. This much is clear because everything that Dungeon Keeper did right, it's here. Everything you loved is here. Some things that were glitchy about DK2 or just inconvenient are upgraded and/or gone (building prisons while your minions are walking through the area will no longer accidentally imprison them, for one example). Obviously, the game is not DK. Types of minions and rooms have been changed, as is necessary, I suppose. I thought I might find this hard to come to terms with (after all, the Dark Angel from DK2 is one of my favorite video game characters of all time, hence why I have a portrait of one on the wall behind me), but it's really not bad at all. It's even refreshing, in a way. I was actually excited to see new character types to play with and master. The visuals are stunning. There are bits of humor here and there. And either the voice actor they got is doing a ridiculously fantastic job of mimicking the guy from DK2, or he IS the guy from DK2. Either way, props.\n\nI very enthusiastically recommend this game, even in early access. Although the campaign is limited to a tutorial mission and one other mission now (plus four others, including a sandbox and a My Pet Dungeon because, well, YES!!!), the game is highly playable, and I can see myself getting at least 20 hours out of the state it is in now, but then again, I am a sucker for just messing around with a game and perfecting it. The average player will probably get 5-10 hours out of this or so in its early access state. But with active developers (just check the forums, if you want), you will be able to purchase an early access with the knowledge that your input does, in fact, count. If you like providing feedback on a game or being one of the first to play an awesome game, buy this. If you want to delve into this and play the whole campaign over the span of a few days, put this in your wishlist, because you'll have to wait a few months for that (early 2015 is the current estimated release date). Either way, you'll want to buy it, sooner or later. ;)","August 1, 2014","true","5.2"," 81 of 96 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","81","96","0","7"

See Conclusion\nThe game was given to me for review purposes\nINTRODUCTION:War for the Overworld is a real-time-strategy / dungeon management game which was developed and published by Subterranean Studios. The game was made possible through Kickstarter and seeks to establish itself as the spiritual successor to the original Dungeon Keeper series of games, going so far as to hire the same narrator from that series. The game and its devs were also praised by Peter Molyneux, the original creator of Dungeon Keeper.\n\nThe plot is pretty straight forward and borrows heavily from the Overlord series' plot line where the player takes on the role of a newly resurrected evil overlord who seeks to rebuild his domain and take vengeance against the currently ruling human empire.\n\nPROS:+ Good artistic design that manages to capture the look and feel of Dungeon Keeper\n+ Nice graphics, specially for a Unity engine game\n+ Excellent voice acting from Richard Ridings (the Dungeon Keeper narrator)\n+ The game was able to preserve DK's gameplay while making a few improvements of their own such as the 'Sins' system.\n+ Skill / Tech Tree system that makes for several variations in dungeon builds (Sins system)\n+ Good sound effects and atmosphere\n+ Good variety of monster / minions with different skills and abilities\n+ Fun campaign maps and missions\n+ Fast paced action\n+ Constant updates and interaction by the developers with the community\n+ Good game time\n\nCONS:- The tutorial missions does not cover a lot of the game's mechanics\n- The gameplay is essentially RTS but with the Combat / Minion control being woefully underdeveloped\n- Severe performance drops during late game situations: (specially when there are a lot of units on the map)\n- Tool Tips is lacking: For example, if you move your mouse over to the Spells Tab, It should show  something like this “Spells Tab (B)” so that the player immediately knows that its bound to the B key but it doesn't so you'll have to refer back to the Controls Menu to see which key is bound to which UI element. This is very inconvenient specially for a fast paced game like this.\n- First Person / Possession mode needs a lot of work: particularly, the fact that the character models of the currently possessed minion sometimes clip over the camera.\n\nNEUTRAL:+/- Demon hand: I know its part of Dungeon Keeper's legacy but it would have been nice to have an option to use the regular mouse cursor.\n+/- Story is predictable specially if you've played Overlord 1 and 2.\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD GAME. War for the Overworld is certainly NOT Dungeon Keeper 3 but its the closest one out there. The developers are certainly passionate about this game and should no doubt be praised for making a much better spiritual successor with such a limited budget unlike that other game[www.metacritic.com] that should be buried deep beneath the earth and forgotten.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike our Reviews?

I am keenly aware that this game was made by fans of Dungeon Keeper; and for what it is there is an amazing wealth of throwback to the game it is trying to emulate.\n\nUnfortunately it also suffers from everything you would expect from what is essentially a "mod team" that is trying to convert itself to an actual development studio. The amateur mistakes show through with poor game balance and narrow strategic layers that never reach the level of variety as the original DK's pulled off. The costs of spells, the speed of unit deployment, the limited number of strategies that the enemy AI is able to cope with; the list of cons is fairly long.\n\nBasically what the game ends up being is a very polished shell with Dungeon Keeper logos painted all over it but inside is just empty and hollow.\n\nTo their credit this team also continues to expand on the game, and I'll admit there has been improvement over time. But the reality is that it's a very long time coming. For a released game we're still seeing things added that should have been in from day one (and that was years ago...).\n\nIn summary this game is a labor of love from a devoted team trying to recreate Dungeon Keeper and if you are a fan of that old series and can afford to throw money in their direction. Do it. This may in the end be the only close successor the gaming world will see (at least in this decade). Just be aware that the game is heavily flawed and I'm not sure the dev team has the experience needed to ever make it as-good-as Dungeon Keeper really was, so we (as a community) must either foster them in the hopes they improve or just play it for what it is and cry over what's missing.\n\nOn a side note if you have not played the originals; find them. Get Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2; they are available on GOG, and worth the effort. Despite the slightly aging graphics they are still fantastic games. Then come play War for the Overworld with us and pray it continues to reach for the glory of what Dungeon Keeper once was.\n\nAs-is I'll continue to play War for the Overworld occasionally and hope the team behind it continues to learn and improve on it (which they have done for many years now, impressively for a team with no official training or past game development experience)","May 27","true","20.2"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","54","60","0","5"

The concept is there, there is also passion but it is not finished. If you buy now, expect to see a lot of placeholders, bugs and tedious issues that take away from the feel of the game.\n\nBesides all that unpolishedness the biggest glaring problem is with the pacing of the game. There is very little time to actually build and manage your dungeon and the minions before AI starts sending in wave after wave of units at you. I sincerely hope they stop trying to make this into RTS game and instead focus on the original idea of God-game, management and building. Fighting is certainly part of Dungeon Keeper games but I never thought it was the main focus of it.\n\nBuy it now if you are willing to gamble whether devs actually finish and fix the game and take it where you want them to take. I find it unlikely that they will change the pacing. So if you are interested in (simple) RTS game with (very) little building/management featues on the side, and don't mind it being unfinished, go for it.\n\nDon't buy it if you don't want to risk it. It is very much unfinished.\n\nI'm stuck with the game.

Dungeon Keeper II stands as one of my favorite games of all time, and I still remember my disappointment when I heard Dungeon Keeper III had been cancelled.  After playing several beta builds of War for the Overworld, I think I can comfortably say that this game is the one I've been waiting for.\n\nStepping into the game, I was amazed with what these guys have accomplished so far.  The creature and level design does sway a bit "grittier" than Dungeon Keeper, but it doesn't detract from the feel of the game.  The rooms are exquisitely detailed, which comes across especially well in the first-person view.  The creatures are also gorgeously and creatively rendered, and each unit is fairly easy to pick out among the throng of minions churning around your dungeon.  The interface is already fairly intuitive, with a few niggles here and there.  It can be difficult to select the right minion out of a crowd, and certain vital functions--the "rally" command, for example--can be a hassle to get to.  The game could also benefit from remappable hotkeys, or any hotkeys whatsoever, for that matter.  The devs have stated that hotkeys and remapping are coming in a later patch, though, so I wouldn't dock any points over it.\n\nThe tech tree is extensive and well-done, with some solid improvements over the Warlock research tree from Dungeon Keeper II.  The tree is sorted into three "veins of evil," with your cultist accruing "sins"--research points, basically--which allow you to unlock "aspects," granting access to new rooms, minions, spells, and rituals.  It's all pretty straightforward once you get used to it, but the tutorial doesn't do a great job of explaining how the tech tree works.  You can fumble about with trying to attract a specific minion, only to find out later that the minion's specific room and requirements are tied up somewhere in the Veins.  It's not a huge problem, however, and I'm confident the devs will add a better tutorial in the future.\n\nThe campaign's still on the way, which is the part I was especially looking forward to, so it's impossible to give a solid score at the moment.  However, what the devs have accomplished so far is incredible, and very much in the spirit of the original games.  If you're a fan of the Dungeon Keeper series, or a fan of base-management games in general, I would definitely recommend checking out War for the Overworld.","December 28, 2014","true","85.3"," 78 of 99 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","78","99","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Degovx/recommended/230190/","Degovx","Degovx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Degovx/","366 products in account","I was very very excited for this game. I preordered the day I became aware of it's existence. I probably sank hundreds of hours into DK 1 and 2 in my adolescence and every couple of years I play through them even with the terrible emulation of Dosbox. So when I fired up WFTO and saw that it had the best of everything I remembered from both DK's I was ecstatic, the voice of the mentor was back, and it seemed to have the same sardonic humor I could barely contain myself.\n\nThen I started playing.\n\nThe game itself has the same dynamics of the originals. Carve out some rooms, beat some minions, watch the enemies impale themselves upon your floor spikes. But as you keep playing you realize this is just a shadow of what made the original DK great. There is little to discover (no special rooms to summon elite minions, no fun combinations of defenses, no fun things to do with posession) and you can win nearly every level of the campaign by building 5 or 6 beast pits and dropping a flag on the enemy core. In fact, through have the campaign that is exactly what you HAVE to do since defenses are practically worthless. I only found them useful in 1 campaign level. Usually the enemies will rush you so quickly you have no time to build defenses or train your minions and if you can withstand their attack you can immediately counter to win.\n\nIf you do try and build up and turtle the campaign will just punish you with infinite waves of enemies that rush right passed all your minions to start banging on your core or with the flawless AI micromanagement. Where is the valiant freeing of prisoners? Looting the vaults? Why aren't rooms wrecked up and torched so they need to be fixed?\n\nI kept playing despite the campaign really not being my style. I prefer to spend some time crafting a world then crushing my foes but, hey, it's nice to be pushed outside your comfort area now and again. As you keep playing the rough edges of the game will begin to grate through your resilience causing frustration and agony. The UI is sluggish and the buttons small. I have tried to click the little cancel attack flag circle and burrowed through the wall of my base too many times. Paging through the laggy menus to lighting bolt a worker who is stuttering around my base as the AI simultaneously blasts 6 of my workers while dropping 30 minions onto the square they just took in my base is psychological torture.  Or sometimes the game lags so bad you just drop a flag where you need to be and go make lunch, coming back 30 minutes later to see you won while AFK (level 9).\n\nThe final nail in the coffin causing me to uninstall my hopes and dreams of a DK successor are the bugs. Workers standing around doing nothing. Defense parts never being delivered. Walls never being repaired. Dropping an attack flag and watching my soldiers walk into a wall while my core gets demolished. Possession freezing my computer. The game is unplayable in Linux and poorly running in Windows. Probably the worst was when I beat the second to last mission (level 12) and the game just never ended. Apparently there is a bug where you can capture an enemy core without destroying it making it impossible to win. For the record this was patch 1.1.7 which was supposed to be playable. As of now I wish I could get a refund, my 13 hours back, and to wash off this disappointment.","June 23, 2015","false","13.3"," 88 of 117 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","88","117","7","1"

As an avid fan of the Dungeon Keeper franchise since the first release in 1995, I have been very picky about my “evil minion master” games. In all the years since Dungeon Keeper 2, no game has come as close to capturing the essence of what made the original as well as War for the Overworld. Not only does it pay a near flawless tribute to the old mechanics, it has added some very useful ones of its own.\n\nThis, ladies and gentlemen is how you make a sequel. In its current state, there isn’t much to play aside form multiplayer and two skirmish maps, but with the release date only a month away and a big update just around the corner, there really isn’t a reason that a Dungeon Keeper fan wouldn’t bet this game.

I understand the many folks who were dissapointed that the game is 'unfinished'. The thing that keeps me in the dev's camp on this one is reading their posts. This is a group of little guys, who are being honest and forthright about what's been going on with them, why things are the way they are, and what they are working on for the future. This isn't EA or Blizzard with obfuscation and double talk, this is by the fans, for the fans, and that kind of real honesty is uncommon in both gaming and life in general!\n\nSo, to the game. They have masterfully captured the 'flavor' of DK. I have enjoyed the mechanics of the different rooms, and figuring out the spells, rituals, and potions. The graphics are good, they favor the old game without looking dated. I'm playing often, but not constantly, as I enjoy coming back after patches and seeing how they are continuing to put polish on things. Personally am highly looking forward to more Skirmish maps, particularly larger ones! If you like DK, buy this game, and learn to love the progress and the game as is.

To clarify I'm on an i5, GTX 970, 16GB RAM.\n\nMultiplayer is dead due to the poor release decision with the game not being fully finished.

The game remains a buggy and poorly paced mess.\n\nAs far as I can tell the game is about strip mining your dungeon, as there is little obvious incentive to construct corridors, rooms and doors. Wall demolition is practically instantaneous, so there is no time cost to be saved. Strip mining also seems necessary to improve pathing (nothing to get stuck behind). In contrast to demolishing walls, however, trap setting is painfully slow, despite having numerous foundries, so there’s no encouragement to spend any time thinking about subtle traps and dungeon layout. Furthermore, each door and trap appears to have a maintenance cost that reduces your overall available mana pool, so there's a perverse disincentive to building any dungeon structures at all.\n\nI’ve yet to crack mission four due to either game breaking bugs or poor pacing. My first game was abandoned because, despite having taken 90% of the map, my flow of minions completely evaporated and I was left watching the one or two I did have lasered by the AI. My second attempt at the mission lagged out, with around one screen refresh every 20 seconds or so – a problem in other maps, although one the game had previously recovered from after a minute or two.\n\nGame boot and load times might easily be the longest of any of the 1300+ games I currently own. It’s a trivial point, but given the elongated load times I spend a lot of time looking at the loading screen, emphasising how bland and amateurish the loading screen looks.\n\nThe giant evil hand pointer is vastly too large, and it’s consequently difficult to target precisely, not least because you’re hovering above an isometric 3D plane and it’s often not clear whether you should be clicking on the base of the 3D terrain block or the top of it (which might instead result in selecting the adjacent block instead).\n\nPathfinding is poor, and minions repeatedly get “lost”, often stuck behind single objects completely out in the open. For example, I had to rescue a mob of about 8 units bouncing off a spawner, despite there being two clear paths on either side. Units often run out of food or don’t get paid, presumably because they can’t route to food or cash, despite half my dungeon being micropig spawners, taverns and treasure.\n\nThe minimap is largely worthless, with no clear signaling about where an attack might be coming from, and little attempt to distinguish rooms, enemies, minions, etc.\n\nUltimately, the game seems primarily a fairly traditional, uninspired RTS; spam barracks (monster spawners or whatever) and rush enemy - he or she who builds the most barracks (or barrack-like spawners) fastest wins. You are basically forced to have all your units running around in one mass mob due to the single rally flag, so any kind of subtle tactics are out.\n\nThere may be a good game under the surface here, but after five hours of perseverance I have yet to see it.\n\nedit: I have now flirted with skirmish mode because I desperately want to give this game a chance, and I can see that there's a little bit of complexity here be unlocked, at least as far as research paths. The campaign is the tutorial however, and as the campaign is borked I'm finding skirmish mode to be a little too overhelming to take on for what looks like a fair bit of trial and error to get anything out of. And to be honest, without a campaign to get me hooked, sandbox mode was always going to be a bit too open-ended for my short attention span.","April 2, 2015","false","7.4"," 156 of 247 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","156","247","0","13"

Still crashes. Still many many bugs and unfinished things. I am way too frustrated trying to play through the broken, unfinished stuff with awful performance.\n\nBeating the final "boss" doesn't even make sense in the campaign. Maybe there's supposed to be some more cutscenes that explain it that aren't finished/added yet? The overall story is very poorly written.\n\nThe campaign is very short, only extended by game crashes or not being able to load game saves because of a "gc too many threads" error. I'm guessing they beefed up the garbage collection to help with the memory leak but caused another bug in the process??\n\nI can't spawn heroes from the hero gate in the "My Pet Dungeon" level. I guess they didn't add that functionality yet? Also, I can't get any more of the errr experience points? So I can't unlock all the things. It's just so buggy. There's no real reason to play that level :/\n\nI do not call this a "spiritual successor" to Dungeon Keeper because DK1 & 2 were actually good whereas this is not. It is not worthy of such a name or comparison.\n\nVisuals: Poor. Low poly models and blah textures without any kind of shading (lighting effects and whatnot) on them. Environment art is better than the character art, but still doesn't feel that great.\nAudio: Meh. They got the original DK voice actor, but he doesn't sound as good as I remember him being. He used to have a deeper more sinister or demonic voice. I miss that rumble in his voice when he said "Keeper".\nGameplay: Poor. Campaign mission design is weak. Just drop your flag on the enemies heart and it's over. Or get rekt by the AI while you're (graphically) lagging out.\nDo NOT buy this game. Your money is better spent elsewhere. I kind of wish I could get a refund :/\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------\nOriginal Review April 6, 2015:\nI recommend NO only because the game was released in a very unfinished state.\n\nThere's lots of placeholder text.\nMultiplayer lobby is broken.\nPart of the "Possession" spell's tooltip says that attacking and using the unit's abilities doesn't work yet. (It doesn't)\nThe first level bugged out for me. I killed the group of dwarves in the island but the objective never updated. I probably used the rally flag too many times or something. I don't know. I had to restart it and carefully follow the instruction and then it worked.\nStraight up hard crash on the 4th level. It just finished the intro bit about how I have beasts and I was moving the camera around and mining stuff and building things and then suddenly the screen turned white and everything was unresponsive. Had to hard reboot my desktop.\nI can't complete the 4th level. After reaching the other keeper, everything gets super choppy and eventually hard crashes my computer. This time with a bright green screen instead of white screen. I'm thinking there's an extra hard memory leak in it :/\nAlso, the textures aren't that high res and the geometry feels very low poly for a game being released in 2015. Maybe they're trying to really get that Dungeon Keeper 2 feel and visuals. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nOnce the game gets patched up to how it should have been when it was released, I'll reevalute this review. I know the devs are trying hard (multiple patches per day since release), but I just can't recommend the given product right now.","April 5, 2015","false","109.7"," 105 of 164 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","105","164","0","0"

The game if far too buggy to recommand quite yet, and personally I preferred the style of DK1 over DK2, which obviously seems to have been the main source of inspiration.\n\n\nNevertheless, here's a list of noteworthy bugs, issues etc. I encountered while playing the campaign:\n\n- Options. No settings for controls, especially mouse. Also the graphics options are slightly limited.\n- Cursor. Its size and the animations, often make it difficult to click precisely. It's also a bit laggy at times.\n- UserInterface. Most tooltips contain a lot of unformatted placeholder data. Some of the buttons etc. are a bit too bulky (Add UI scaling option?). Sometimes clicking the buttons won't register, or they're otherwise a bit unresponsive.\n- Performance. Frequent lag spikes after a while, and in the bigger levels the game begins to slow down quite notably.\n- AI. The minions act just plain stupid at times. Ignoring enemies right in front of them, fleeing while having plenty of health, stuck somehow unwilling to attack while in combat, imps selecting task far away when there's stuff to do right next to them, and the list going on.\n- Voiceover. The periodic taunts get annoying really fast. Having a very limited number of variations and starts repeating pretty quickly.\n- Pace. For whatever reason, the game seems a bit sluggish.\n- Map. There is no fullscreen map and the minimap isn't really informative enough.\n- Crashes. Some stability issues. Nothing recurring or gamebreaking yet.\n- Glitches. Some of the 3d models get stuck on the user interface. Such as while holding a minion, dragging the cursor over the minimap.\n\nI'll check back later and edit this review to reflect on the game's state at the time.\n\n\nNext I'd like to do a little comparison for those that might deem it helpful. As said before, WftO is far closer to DK2 than DK1, what's the difference. Well I certainly can't break it all down here, but here's some things from the top of my head.\n\n- Mana. DK Gold used gold for everything.\n- Imps. In DK Gold they were unlimited, limited only by their increasing price.\n- Graphical tone. DK Gold was darker, grittier and in general more sinister.\n- Overall feel. With verything combined, the music, the visuals, the narration, the jokes and the gameplay, in my opinion DK Gold had far superior athmosphere.\n- Language. Apart from the occasional taunt and the narrator, there was no real language. Now, for example the cultists speak and in plain english.\n- Voiceover. It's great to hear a familiar voice, but it just seems too cheerful and cheesy.\n- Upkeep. In DK Gold imps and traps require no upkeep.\n- Statistic. Such as the mood and task of minions, was clearly modelled after DK2 rather than DK Gold. Especially the combat log in DK Gold was invaluable in making sense of the chaos. No such feature here.\n- Walls. In DK Gold, fortified wall were indestructible, except by a special spell, making quick land grabbing and fortifying of key locations, an important part of the strategy. Also walls could not be recovered once dug out, forcing you to really pick and choose.\n- Handling of minions. DK1 didn't add any penalty to manually moving minions around, nor was there a limit to where you can pick them up from as long as were alive and not in the enemy's custody.\n\nThese may seem like minor details, but put together they drastically affect the gameplay and the overall feel. I'm making this point, just in case you were expecting more DK1-like feel rather than the DK2 that this game currently has.\n\n\nTL;DR\nDo you prefer?\n- DK2: Wait for patches, and buy the game.\n- DK1: Wait for patches, consider carefully.","April 5, 2015","false","7.0"," 56 of 83 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","56","83","0","0"

I loved the series and played it a lot as a kid and always remember it being one of my personal favorites.\n\nWhen I started playing this one; all of the memories came back and it was a great feeling. The ability to play a game that dated to my childhood, and for it to be updated with more stuff than what was available before; especially multiplayer. They did a good job of keeping to the way it was remembered back in DK 1 and 2, as well as adding some more unique features in that keeps it entertaining.\n\nThe graphics received an over-haul, and it seems to perform alright on almost any modern machine  (I can also get decent FPS from my laptop if I close out everything else running - mind you the laptop runs 16GB DDR3 RAM w/ AMD graphics). It does get sluggish quite a bit as you build your dungeon, even on a pretty high-end desktop. Changing the graphics settings from Ultra down to normal or even low sometimes still doesn't fix the sluggish frame drops that you'll receive. The game needs more optimization which I hope they start focusing on.\n\nThe music keeps to the theme, and the sound effects are great. The only sound I do miss, is the mistress that entered your dungeon from having the torture chamber (the crack of the whip and the mmmm lol). The original announcer is back, along with the funny jokes and commentary that anyone who played the DK series loved.\n\nI only wish that the multiplayer support was there a bit more. I attempted to search for an online game last night, and I found one server total which was a 1v1 match and was full, so I just went back and did a skirmish with the CPU. The community aspect could be a thousand times better, and right now it is almost next to impossible to get anyone else in an online match unless you are playing with a friend.\n\nHopefully with more updates, this game becomes extremely popular.

It truly felt like I was playing the next logical step, or Dungeon Keeper 3, if you will.\n\nFor those uneducated and/or unexperienced in the Dungeon Keeper series, War for the Overworld is a strategy game where you play as the Underlord, the master of a dungeon that you build from the ground up.  You dig out the earth surrounding your dungeon core and designate what the tiles that you have dug out are to be repurposed for.  Barracks, lairs, torture chambers, prison, sanctuaries, traps, and many, many other rooms are available, all of which have their own unique abilities that they add to your dungeon and most of which that bring in new creatures to serve you in crushing the competing underlords and those pesky human armies that seek to reclaim their land from you.\n\nAll in all a great game and one that I highly recommend those fans who have been waiting years for a legitimate sequel to the Dungeon Keeper series.","June 28, 2015","true","18.8"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

I was forced to watch a boss lie prone in his room for three minutes with my camera slow panning around as the advisor and him took turns repeating the same lines and working their way down the queued up announcements.  Then I was defeated by his reinforcements while unable to act.  Stability will probably improve and developers have hinted at more campaigns in the future.\n9 two player maps, 2 three player maps, 9 four player maps for local skirmish and multiplayer usage.  Will almost certainly increase.\nFunctional AI's\nFunctional Multiplayer now.\nGraphics and UI is mostly functional and responsive now. Apparently some machines will use their integrated intel GPU instead of their better GPU when playing War for the Overworld, which requires system changes by the user to fix.  Unusual, but will probably be fixed.\nA long list of promised future content which gets shorter every time I check it.  I'm still curious as to what happened to a co-op campaign or playing as the light followers on release.  Perhaps these went the way of their original Dungeoneer build.  May be added later.\nWar for the Overworld follows a similar formula to Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2 in being a god-mode (watch from above, unable to issue direct commands to your units) real time strategy game.  Build rooms to entice specific creatures and provide services for them and you by proxy, and then lead them on a dark crusade to do whatever it is your dark heart desires.\n\nUnlike its Dungeon Keeper compatriots, War for the Overworld takes a faster paced, Starcraft-like approach which focuses less on watching and catering to a small number of elite, well trained creatures and more on building and using the perks of a massive dungeon to amass large numbers of minions quickly.  Followers will blur together and become nondescript as dozens of them stampede around the dungeon, and there is little time or even reason to watch your underlings go about their business due to the constant necessity to always be expanding and building.  This is especially true since the maximum unit cap is extremely generous and imps (your workers) work at light speed.  Matches turn into a breakneck race to see who can build the most rooms with the most equipment to lure the most creatures in, which results in most of my play time being focused on issuing dig commands and building rooms instead of on the many other (often much less useful) tools they provide.\n\nI'm probably a little jaded due to the half baked release, but overall, War for the Overworld is decent but not quite good in its current state.  The game's pacing feels off, as most of my time playing is spent digging and building random rooms instead of enjoying whatever other charms War for the Overworld may have.  It will probably get better over time as the developers have expressed their devotion to improving the game and releasing new content, which may make it worth the price tag in the future.  War for the Overworld is worth buying for extremely hopeful fans of the genre who want to support this project or if it's on sale.","May 12, 2015","false","24.4"," 58 of 93 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","58","93","0","2"

It feels like it still in early access or in early beta. Needs to be patched and updated for a more polished product before I can recommend this for purchase.\n\nWhile I have played the game for a few hours now (only the campaign mode), I can say I am not sure what I have played. The UI just feels like a mess to sort through and the mouse button feels floaty and out of place. Missing text or substitute names (like "Prop: Tree 101"...not a direct example) for most objects in the game. AI seems to be functional is some places and missing in others. Goblin workers run in place sometimes, priorities of what you want the workers to do seems random, and even most minions (to include the NPC enemy's units) can walk on liquid surfaces like Jesus. Now there are some creatures that can bypass liquid areas with float/fly and that makes sense, but I don't think a dwarf or soldier in heavy armor has the ability to do that.\n\nThere seems to be alot of information missing for the player as well. The tutorial will say certain rooms to need to be 3x3 or etc to function, but never show or remind you later when hovering over a room to build. More lack of information comes from how much food or gold is needed for their upkeep. It also doesn't tell how many units your dungeon can hold or build or even how long it takes to build said units. For instance, I built 100,000 gold worth of room called Beast Den. It does not require much space and I built it above recommended specs. In terms 100,000 gold for one room is quite a lot, but I am not what benefit, if any at all, that gave me. (To note I did build the structure over multiple areas, but still above recommended specs in each place). It seemed the creatures didn't become more powerful or spawn more frequently. They would just spawn a guy every minute or so and thats all I could really tell you. Even if I spent a more reasonable 5000-7500 gold, it seemed it was the same spawn rate and same amount of creatures given. It just doesn't make sense to me...and that is the common theme in the game.\n\nNothing makes sense there is such a lack of communication of information from the game to the player. And when the game tries to relay information it seems to be done poorly. Nothing about this title suggests to me its polished or ready to sell as is.\n\nI remember launch being a month ago and I waited for patches and etc. The same bugs and lack of polish can still be found today.\n\nFor all those applauding this game for being a great example for how early access games should be released, I think you should do a double take and remove your rose tinted glasses for a new Dungeon Keeper title.\n\nThe game isn't ready for sale and needs more polish. It is a shame that they released it in such a poor state as I haven't covered the still missing features like skirmish mode. I hope this doesn't turn out to be another cash grab early access game where development is abandoned later.\n\n\n\n\n","May 1, 2015","false","8.9"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","35","52","0","0"

I removed them both for this one.\n\nI am completely and utterly enraged by how the story develops and ends and even if there will be a DLC to twist the plot somehow, this is utterly inexcusable.\nThis of course is accompanied by my struggle (yes, struggle) against the game-breaking bugs, memory leaks, crashes, freezes, save-corruption and many others.\n\nSPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT\n\n\nRight, so by mission 10 or 11 you are starting to realize that the disembodied voice is not your helper, but rather your master, as opposed to being a tyrant, you're just an executive clerk doing whatever your strong and powerful masturr is telling you to do.\n\nThis is reflected by the fact he repeatedly tells jokes "If your minions ask for your superior, tell them I'm taking a nap.", by the fact he apparently "controls the aether" hence controls you, by Mira saying you're his tool and by him calling you "My Underlord", as if a pawn of his. And, by mission 13's outro, which will be elaborated further next. Unlike the intro video sequence where you might mistake to think he found your presence and revived it, he is in fact your master.\n\nAlright, that is a bit crappy - but not story-breaking for me.\n\nOh, but then comes mission 13. The final mission. You besiege and break through the last hero compound in order to butcher the emperor himself. Pretty neat mission, 3-4 optional objectives - a bit of a droll but wrapping things up knowing the world is pretty much doomed by your hand and will be ripe for the taking by you makes it worthwhile.\n\nYou breach the inner chamber, kill off the emperor's guards and the emperor, but then MAJIQ! his corpse disappears and then proceeding sequence loads you into your home realm, your main core, where the wretched scum just pops out of nowhere while that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mendechaus (w/e his name) says how he found a new pawn and how you're no longer of use to him and that sort of generic crap, then you die.\n\ntl;dr Game over.\nNo conquest, no "cliffhanger" for an upcoming campaign in the overworld, no outro depicting how terror and misery have struck the goodlies. Not even a chance to fight. Just sit there and watch how the pompous ♥♥♥♥♥ just kills you and tyvm for playing. How your campaign ends with a defeaning silence of helplessness. That's the antithesis of being a Dungeon Keeper/Underlord.\n\nI've fought against game-breaking bugs, I've triumphed terribly long loading-screens and save-destroying bugs (wall tiles changing nonstop causing FPS to drop to 5 on a mission vs 3 enemy Underlords)... This is the last straw. This game has the mechanics of its spiritual father, Dungeon Keeper, but not the essence. Maybe multiplayer fans will rejoice in this, but in that case, GL waiting a couple of months until that function will be released properly.\n\nI've uninstalled this game and hopefully this review will be noticed so other people won't feel cheated like I do.\n\nedit: spelling","April 11, 2015","false","30.6"," 55 of 88 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","55","88","5","0"

Which the War For The Overworld is a spirtual successor to because of Bullfrog's closure and EA's acquisition of the rights to the Dungeon Keeper name and franchise.\n\nFor all the games in an alpha/beta/pre-alpha state that I am backing currently (about 7 titles, 5 of which are in Steam's Early Access section including WTFO) this is the one I am most excited about and despite the fact there have only been 2 alpha releases out so far in the "Bedrock Beta", I am happy with the work so far.\n\nIf you are unsure about the game is and what it aims to do, try Dungeon Keeper/Dungeon Keeper 2 because what have I have played so far is almost a vertabim copy of the gameplay and themes from those games (which is a good thing) varying only in monsters, textures, music and names of different rooms and objects.\n\nThe Kickstarter showed a lot of promise (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/subterraneangames/war-for-the-overworld) and I really regret not backing it, but I am happy with the progress being made so far. In only 2 builds we have 2 maps, 4 of the core rooms, 2 spells and  working which is pretty impressive so far.

My hopes for the franchises' rebirth were only raised when i found out about a team of independant DK enthusiasts trying to make a true spiritual successor to the original games.\nI've followed the games' progress through it's kickstarter campaign and it's first appearance on Steam, but i didn't put any money in to it until it's official release.\n\nThe initial releaseAs i'm sure some will already know, the initial release of WftO was a rocky one; as the developers explained[wftogame.com], the game had to be either rushed out with bugs so they got enough funds to polish it later or scrapped altogether, which i'm sure no DK enthusiast would like to see.\nI decided to purchase the Underlord edition anyway despite of the existing bugs, mostly becouse i had good faith in the devs; i guessed they wouldn't abandon their game after all the trouble they went through to make it in the first place; as it turned out in the following months, my faith was deserved.\n\nThe current state of the game, as of patch 1.4 & Heart of Gold releaseI've now replayed the basic campaign twice and the Heart of Gold campaign once; by my second replay at patch 1.2 most of the bugs present at launch were fixed; by then also the performance had been improved notably.\nBy purchasing the Underlord edition at the games' release, i got the expansion for free (which is awesome btw); now having the full WftO expirience, here's my personal list of pro's & possible con's (if they bother you, that is).\n\nPRO'S\n\nImho the closest thing to a spiritual successor to the original Dungeon Keeper series you can find on the gaming market today, including the look & sound of the game (i'll get to the »feel« a bit later)\n\nthe devs went out of their way to secure Richard Ridings (the original DK narrator) for the narrration of WftO and it definitely payed off – with audio being a large part of what made the DK games so good, just hearing his ramblings again gave me a lovely throwback to the good old days\n\nthe developers started out as a small team of DK enthusiasts with a dream; they've shown their dedication and love for the game throughout it's inception as well as through the rough parts; they didn't abandon it while it was at it's lowest point but worked hard to bring it to it's current good state\n\nthe artstyle & graphics are ofcourse more colorful and advanced than in DK, but that doesn't detriment to the games' general atmosphere; if you'll zoom in or even take a look in first person – another welcome throwback from DK – you'll find many nice details around your dungeon.\n\nthe gameplay is largely – although not exactly – similar to DK; you dig out your dungeon, train your minions and do battle in basicly the same manner as you did in DK 1 & 2; ofcourse the devs also had to try and bring some improvements and »fresh wind« in to the genre, where the games' Sin system and some new map & campaign mechanics come in to play (more on that a bit later)\n\nuseful gameplay & UI improvements, some of which had to be implemented becouse of certain new map & campaign mechanics; stuff like the gamespeed slider, the Impasse command and the »Peace army« option\n\nintegrated map editor and workshop support – you can make your own dungeon creations, share them and battle over them with other players\nPOSSIBLE CON'S\n\nMany of the initial complaints were in regard to some of the original campaigns' parts being too »rushy« for a DK successor; indeed there are some missions during which you have to do certain stuff quickly, otherwise the enemy will win. But in the devs' defence, in the meantime most of those maps have been rebalanced and they also included the previously mentioned gamespeed slider, with which you can always slow your game down in case stuff should happen too quickly. Also, due to popular demand, the 4 new missions in the HoG campaign are much more akin to the original DK »explore & expand« playstyle.\n\nBecouse of copyrights, WftO isn't an exact DK clone/successor; for instance, you won't find Horny, Bile Demons or the Casino in the game anymore, although all of those have their approximate counterparts in WftO. Some of them understandably behave a bit differently here, which may turn off some DK purists, but if you're willing to overlook certain details or are new to the genre, you should have no problem with the differences.\n\nIn combination with both points above, the overall gameplay feeling is mostly similar to DK but also distinctly different in certain areas and missions, which may again turn off some DK purists; if you have no problem with having some »fresh wind« in the genre or you haven't played the original Dungeon Keeper, you should be in the green.\n\nAlthough Ridings is the undisputed main star in the voice acting area, there are certain parts of the game, where the voice-acting is a bit underwhelming; the other voice-actors probably did their best to do a proper job, but there's still a chance you'll get the occasional cringe if you're succeptible to such things.\n\nThere are still some bugs, crashes and performance issues present in the game. As usually, some people expirience one thing and others a different thing based on their PC; playing the HoG campaign (1.4) on the PC i specified in the beginning, i've encountered one notable bug and two crashes, but the vanilla campaign functioned flawlessly for me even back in version 1.2. Based on my expirience from the launch up to now, i'd say that the devs are devoted enough to guarantee most of the current HoG bugs gone in the near future, but you might encounter a problem even so (send a report[brightrockgames.userecho.com], they definitely read them)That's about it; if you've made it so far, thanks for reading and i hope i could help you with my review.\n\nTL;DR - if you're a fan of the Dungeon Keeper series or you're new to the dungeon sim genre, i can recommend playing War for the Overworld. Although it is somewhat different to the DK series in certain parts, the overal playstyle, sound and look all borrow heavily on it, making it probably the closest thing to a DK3 on the current gaming market. The overall performance was stable on my rig; there are some issues and bugs present, but based on my past expirience the devs work dilligently on fixing them.","May 29","true","153.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

However, I am now very heartened by the Beta of WOTO. It's basically Dungeon Keeper, only so much better. There are about a dozen room types, which I have yet to get to grasp with, as well as an impressive selection of spells that do everything from reveal parts of the map to freezing the ground. What I also love is the voice acting is very similar to Dungeon Keeper. The guy who does the Keeper sounds appropriately evil and the heroes sound equally pius, making it so much more satisfying when you kill them.. =)\nHowever, the game is still a Beta. There is a tutorial, which explains the basics (there really needs to be an advanced tutorial as well) also, I found it hard to find the flashing tiles on some of the tutorial actions. Perhaps if you centered the screen over the tiles as the event triggers, this would be easier.\nThere are only 2 maps, however, there is a sandbox mode, which I look forward to exploring. Unfortunately, it crashed at the climax of my first game, however, that may be due to my OS.\nAnyway, as long as the developers get this thing to full version, it will be freaking awesome. Given that all of the room design seems to be done (although I have yet to fully observe what all the creatures do and thier various states) making the maps should be pretty easy.\nOh, there is one thing that distinguishes it from Dungeon Keeper, there is no hilarious CG cutscene at the beginning.\nI would like to vote for one, if possible.. =)\nI would give it an 8/10 and it's only a Beta..

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/recommended/230190/","Kreegath","Kreegath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/","227 products in account","This is not a worthy successor to the Dungeon Keeper franchise. The parts are all there, but they're either faulty or shoddily put together. Even if you're an RTS or Dungeon Keeper fan, "War for the Overworld" will be an exercise in frustration and annoyance.\n\nFirst and foremost, the game is lacking in terms of presenting the player with useful and sometimes necessary information. What can this creature do? How strong is that creature? What skill will they get and what do they do? What can the heroes do? Who knows? I certainly don't, because the game never bothers to tell you. I've played it for over 60 hours and have no idea of the relative power levels between creatures in the game. Not that you really need a balanced army or anything, but it'd be nice to know what your guys can or can't do. In Dungeon Keeper, you knew bugs were crap, bile demons were badass and that mistresses and vampires could wreck most things in 1v1. Here, I have zero clues what my gnarlings can take, what beasts are good or what the chunder actually does. No clue whatsoever. Just mass creatures and call to arms to their base, then hope for the best.\n\nIn terms of the story itself, you've been relegated to the role of underling to the narrator, who's the main character of the game. He's the one interacting with the overlords and heroes of the game, he's the one telling you what to do and he's the one setting the agenda. You're just along for the ride. Now I know how my imps feel, always getting told exactly where to go and what to do. Maybe you can find enjoyment in that, and if so then this is the story for you, but I couldn't. I want to be the main character in the game I play.\n\nThe game is horribly optimized, to the point where I can't tab out and back in without it grinding to a screeching halt and you need to restart. I've been able to play Starcraft 2 with the highest settings, skyping and having a browser up at the same time without performance issues. I've played Crusader Kings 2 grand campaigns with no real issue. I've played Grey Goo and Planetary Annihilation without it killing my computer, but War for the Overworld is slow and sluggish. It's incredibly slow and sluggish. You will also run into a lot of lag-related issues ingame, like the fog of war not dissolving when you explore, your creatures losing their focus and just standing around like idiots, creatures seemingly starting to teleport all over the map or even creatures starting to ghost (by which I mean they stand still and you can hover your mouse over them to see their info, but you can't interact with them because they're not really there, but the game just hasn't updated their location, so you're stuck with their ghost for a couple of seconds before the game eventually rectifies this). You're also going to see visual bugs, like creatures freezing mid-animation. You can also run into visual problems where the minimap doesn't load, where the UI doesn't load or where certain rooms and backgrounds won't load, so you're stuck with black nothingness in the middle of your dungeon.\nLastly, the game starts to suffers from increasingly heavy UI lag, where you press a button and sometimes need to wait for a couple of seconds before it actually interacts. Sometimes you have to press a button three or four times before it actually gets pressed. In stressful situation, I don't need to tell you how annoying it can be to try and reposition your creatures whilst casting spells and fighting your own UI and the game's lag.\n\nThe AI doesn't work. In Dungeon Keeper, you told your imps to do something and eventually they'd come around to finishing it. Not so much in War for the Overworld. Your imps will start a diggin task, stop and run to the other side of your dungeon, stop again, run to a random room and turn, run and chop once at a gold square, run back with the handful of gold, start reinforcing some random wall for a bit, then stop and run back to the original position and claim a square or two before going back to digging for a bit. It's beyond frustrating. At first I thought I just overloaded them with tasks, but no matter how little you give them to do, they won't ever do it faster or more efficiently. I tried maxing out the number of imps, but it made literally no difference. You keep your five original imps, but just ignore them and do everything yourself. It'll save you time and headache. This is a kiss of death for a dungeon building game, in my opinion.\nImps are not the only ones with a severely lacking AI, though. Some creatures won't ever do what you tell them to, ever. Beastmasters will not train in your training room unless you stand over them and cast spells to force them. They won't fight in combat more than occationally, instead going to the back of the fight and walking around in circles. You will also have creatures that get so sleepy, hungry and are so greedy, that you will never see them do anything but beeline between their beds, the tavern and the pig pens, trying to satiate their desires.\nSometimes, when the game slows down too much, the AI stops working altogether, and you will have to restart before fighting any battles. This is because your creatures won't actually fight, the AI can't use any skills in this state, but will opt to stand around, walk back and forth and sometimes losing and regaining the call to arms flag trigger.\nFinally, I need to bring up the one way you can control your creatures in this game when not standing on your own lands, the call to arms flag. Sometimes there will be areas in the game where your call to arms won't work. You place it like always and everything seems fine, but your creatures will suddenly lose interest and walk away. It's beyond frustrating.\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend against getting this game. Don't buy War for the Overworld if you're a fan of Dungeon Keeper, because this is such a poor substitute you'll be pulling your hair in frustration. Don't buy it if it's on sale, it's not worth a dollar of your money. It's not fun. It's not challenging. It's buggy, it's simplistic and it's been done before and done better. The AI doesn't work, the UI is slow and unresponsive, the story is not even revolving around the player and you'll play the game from beginning til end without ever having to learn anything about it. Just go through the motions, call to arms in their base, rinse repeat. Do yourself a favour and play something else.","February 11","false","103.2"," 52 of 89 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","52","89","4","11"

YOU'RE WRONG! Yes this is a great game in its own respect and i do really like it but it's far from any replacement or will ever get as much playtime by me. If you think that well it's all on opinion anyway, I can always replay dungeon keeper and Keeperfx for those who know what that is.\n\nThis game is also more like dungeon keeper 2 rather than dungeon keeper which by my personal experience and preferance I always favoured the original on just about every level of things that can be judged, yes the graphics were maybe slightly better in an arguement but again my personal opinion was  that I liked the original better.\n\nAnyway back to it, war for the overworld is a great game in its own respect and i would say is worth the money to anyone willing to find a good strong dungeon management strategy game to fill that gap on their stack of games. The graphics are great and in general it has a nice look about it, can be a little confusing to start off with but should be quick to pick up with many things to help you learn as you play. At its current state they have a few playable feautures and such in game but no solid set down campaign yet as that'll be one of the last updates released, some of the updates may be slow and not seem to do much but each is always improving the game and pushing it closer to its end goal. If not to buy the game now then it'd be good to add to wish list or keep an eye on for when this game hits full release, For sure it's going to be a hit if not already.\n\nWar for the overworld is not dungeon keeper.

Not only does War For The Overworld capture that old Dungeon Keeper atmosphere, it nails the gameplay WITH positive additions - and I personally respect the after-purchase patching support to improve the game. These guys are obviously passionate about what they made, and they are working hard, even after release...\n\nIn short: If you're looking for that old Dungeon Keeper vibe, with new additions that actually improve on it...

As many may already know, a handful of developers have tried to recreate the magic that Bullfrog crammed into the DK franchise.. they all failed miserably. However, these guys, swearing fealty to the original successful formula had a crack at making a worthy successor, and by god, they made it better.\n\nWhat they have created is a maleficent and joyous game which remains true to the style of the DK franchise, however, with the addition of a couple of other game mechanics and room types. What is surprising in this case is how natural the game mechanics fit, the developers have clearly given a lot of thought into exactly how these extra mechanics can fit without disrupting the experience or alienating old players of the DK franchise. As a result, the additions make it stand out on its own as its own game and not some mere clone of DK2.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful to look at and smooth to play, hearing the return of the old DK mentor was a nostalgic and welcomed addition. However, if I was to be picky, I would criticise that some of the minions just do not have the charm, style, nor variation that the DK franchise had. Additionally, the minion character models seem to be of a lower quality than the rest of the game, whether this was done for optimisation, I'm not sure, but I did hope for better.\n\nMany others have reviewed that the game has many bugs, I would partly concur with this. While the game does have a few bugs, I found that none were game-stopping bugs, just very minor niggles such as menu responsiveness. I take my hats off to the developers who have seemed to be updating the build like crazy trying to iron out some of the issues (we've had 2 patches in 24 hours of official launch at the time of writing).\n\nWould I recommend? Yes, definitely. If you are a seasoned DK player eager to find a game that fills that evil chasm in your heart, or a casual player looking for a fun yet challenging strategy game, I would wholeheartedly recommend this War for the Overworld.\n\nDevelopers, if you happen to read this, two words I'd like to say: "Good job!"","April 4, 2015","true","13.8"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

I think a lot of people are under the impression this game is ready to play right now but in reality this is still a solid work in progress so you should expect to face some problems.\n\nOutside of the launch issues there are some gameplays critiques.  The AI is not the most intelligent, generally i found it easy to fool or work out what triggered a certian event to progress a level forward so i had more time to build up an unbeatable force.  In end i managed to complete the game in less than a day without too much effort.  So sadly i got a bit bored of this by time i reached end, seemed all too repeatative.\n\nIn comparison to the oringal DK games however I think they have got the interface and general balance of characters down to a tee.  The traps and potential options on dungeon layouts etc make it more interesting than it has been before.\n\nI reckon the multiplayer will be real key to this games success, if the can get that right then this will boom, but sadly i would be concerned that they will be able to address enough of the current performance issues before interest is lost and then who would be left to play multiplyer anyway?\n\nAll round i think its a fun game and really enjoyed strolling down memory lane, but if i was new to this game id be highly frustrated by no wand probably thrown it out the window and never looked back.

I already played and loved the first part, so it was clear to to me that this game will be on my birthday wish list. After my aunt took me to the store and bought this piece of happiness compressed in some silly little disc for me, it was time to frolic home, barricade myself in my own little dungeon, switch on my computer and enjoy the last sweet hours of my jolly childhood...\n\nAnyway: this isn't a review about DK 1 or 2, but about War for the Overworld! Nonetheless, it's very related. DK2 already had the trailer for the third part in the game, where you take the war to the Overworld. That was the hour of birth of my expectations there would surely be a sequel to this beloved game. These expectations would slowly degenerate to hope. And as hope faded away, the warming memories, also vanishing in the haze, were the only thing left. At least one could enjoy the odd game of the old classic. Yet sometimes there seemed to be light in that darkness: a few games were taking some elements from DK or even claiming to be like DK (Dungeons or Impire e.g.). In my opinion all of them failed (not meaning that they were very bad) and it just fed and therefore revived my hope, which should remain false for almost 1 1/2 decades....\n\nAnd along comes „War for the Overworld“:\n\nHearing of WtfO I had to check it out. After being disappointed a few times I have to admit that my expectations were not all to high when I started the game for the first time. And I was wrong! HOORAY!!!!!! It is just like DK! Carving myself deeper and deeper into the dirt, the sarcastic narrator giving the odd comment and being able to watch my minions scamper around my dungeon made me rejoice (though one also has to say that it is clear that the game is not finished yet). DK fans will know what game play I'm talking about. The ones of you who don't know DK could check it out YouTube.\n\nPeople complaining that the game is a simple duplicate of DK are forgetting that's what the devs are trying to achieve. The third title of the Series would of been „Dungeon Keeper 3: War For The Overworld“. The actual creator of the original DK, Peter Molyneux, gives them his full support (see below). Since the charming company owning the rights of Bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper were simply not interested in making a sequel (except some lousy mobile version imo) I'm quite happy to see this project in the hands of devs who are committed to what they do. To remain fair a few people have posted this company supports the idea of the project and is helping Subterranean Games to avoid legal issues. I couldn't find a link on Google though (if somebody could add or let me know I would be very grateful)\n\nA Message From Peter Molyneux, The Creator of Dungeon Keeper\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsRRzr0eBKc\n\nApparently this can't be said often enough: It's an Early Access game. That means the game is NOT FINISHED YET! So at the current state you should not have excessively high expectations. Early Access on the other hand can be an excuse for some devs not to work on a game anymore and go into an undeserved retirement.\nYet the devs of Subterranean Games are very committed to their project, very active on the forums and keep you informed what they are up to on a weekly basis with „WtfO Wednesday“.\n\nTo anybody who loved and loves DK I highly recommend this title! No further discussion!\n\nTo anybody who doesn't know Dungeon Keeper but wants to try out a unique sort of game where you carve your own dungeon out of raw stone and dirt, watch your minions drink and fight (and slap them if they get on your nerves), let your captives rot in prison or being tortured and do much more evil things I do also recommend this title.\n\nTo anybody who wants a finished game to play right now I do not recommend this game. But I would advise you to keep an eye on it.\n\nI, for one, can hardly wait for this gem to be released and will surely be sitting in front my pc for hours, not being able to wipe that ridiculous, sardonic, mean little grin off my face!\n\n\nShort version\n\nAwesome!!! 10/10","September 10, 2014","true","6.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I bought a game called 'Dungeons' on Steam a few years ago and was dissappointed. It played more like 'the Sims - Dungeon Keeper'.\n\nWhen I saw this game was out and saw a high proportion of negative reviews I had low expectations. However, with a 10% discount and free DLC and some positive reviews I gave them my money and booted it up, with fingers crossed. Oh I am so glad I did!\n\nThis is the Dungeon Keeper clone we have been waiting for. It stays true to the original game whilst adding enough new stuff to keep it fresh. Also this is just an early build with active work taking place, but it still plays great. The game mechanics work here and I didn't realise how important the RTS element was, making the game more competitive and challenging. True you don't really design a dungeon for adventurers to explore (Sword Coast: Legends will allow you to do this I am sure).\n\nYou are basically an evil master who encourages minions and sets the hordes against your foes, sometimes stubborn Dwarves and other times your similar skilled brethren. The game plays at a fast enough pace so you don't get bored. I have already gone back to previous campaign missions to chase missing achievements as they are all so much fun. I still have the final two campaign levels to go, and am looking forward to my free DLC\n\nIf you are a retro gamer who enjoyed Dungeon Keeper you should like this game; if you are into Fantasy and RTS games you will enjoy this game and if you are both you will LOVE this game!","April 14, 2015","true","14.4"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","0"

Ah, how I loved those games. I was so excited to see that War for the Overlord is a game using not only the same mechanics, but even Richard Ridings, who's voice is like liquid sex evil.\n\nThere are a few things I disllike, but it's based in on the fact that the game is still in Beta. There's not really a storyline developed for play yet. There's no multiplayer (Comming Soon™). The few maps that you cna play are really limited in resources.\n\nI know these things will get developed and ironed out as work is continued. It is that hope coupled by the warm and evil feelings of nostalgia that led me to buy this game. Don;t worry if you haven;t played Dungeon Keeper 1 and/or 2. It's really not necessary. But I can promise you, when this game reaches it's full potential, I believe it will outshine those other dungeon management games.\n","August 22, 2014","true","41.5"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","2"

I've watched the development from day 1, tested the "unofficial" version and finally decided it's time.\nConsidering i spent literally lots of hundreds of hours in the Dungeon Keepers, and adding the confidence, commitment and love the developers show for their project, i can safely predict what this will become: GLORIOUS!\n\nIt looks and feels almoust identical, except the modern graphics of course. Well, modern is not quite right. It still looks dated, but not compared to that old original DKs. Well does that matter? HELL NO! It's more than adequate and gameplay > graphics!\nAlthough WFTO tries to clone DK in every aspect legally possible (even the "...has entered your dungeons"-voiceover had exactly the same melody) i've notices some minor additions that won't change gameplay but makes it more fluid. Like different rallies for workers (YAY!) and warrios. Or a flag to forbid workers to dig there (YAY!) or groupings (YAY!).\nWhy reinvent the wheel? It already was perfect.\n\nSure, a recommendation based on a tutorial and a sandbox is quite risky (as there is not much of a campaign here yet), the basic gameplay-skeleton looks and feels "right".\nTHIS IS THE SUCCESSOR WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR TOO LONG!\n\nEven if it does not add much new things, it revives one of the best game/gamplays of all times. Although i still play DK2, this will end an era and start a new.\n\nWhat about Dwelvers? They're damn brilliant too, and even a lot cheaper. But they're having a different approach. Taking the master and bringing in their own vision. This is totally fun too, but it's not DK3. Not visually and not gameplay-wise.\nGet then both if you can!\nIf you can't, get this one if you prefer the "darker" original gamplay and get Dwelvers if you want some creative fresh ideas added to an already superb gameplayconcept.\n\ntl;dr:\nYou're into RTS? You like a game that does not take itself damn serious? You're quite fed being the "good" fighting the oh-so-bad? Give this one a try! But only if you think this will really suit you, otherwise WAIT until it's done! Without the campaign you'll stuck with the sandbox. The campaign will decide it's final faith (and multiplayer of course).\n\nAlternative? Except the masters itself, there is only Dwelvers. Maybe "Dungeons 2" (time will tell). Besides there are no games (to my knowledge) that come even close to this gameplay and fun.

I want to kill more goodly heroes! well I felt lazy in the 2nd episode of the campagin and spawned juggernauts in the core xD. Well, enjoyed the story and how its a half tutorial while strategically positioning your units to destroy the enimes miserable forces, feels so good to swarm them and they die in seconds, also currently there wasnt any sort of time limit to the campagian so far so I liked the casual feel to it.\n*SANDBOX*\nAh, my favourite gamemode, you should know why.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coactum/recommended/230190/","coactum","Coactum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coactum/","910 products in account","First off, great work Stubterranean games! I've been a backer of this project from its inception, and other than the occasional 5 minute bout every six months to get a feel for how things were coming along I've all but avoided every piece of news about the game in the hopes that I wouldn't spoil myself for release.\n\nI'm a long time fan of the Dungeon Keeper series and fondly remember as a 10 year old sinking entire school holidays into figuring out how to deal with digging into clusters of level 10 Samurais. Dungeon Keeper has and always will have a place on my hard drive alongside many of the Bullfrog classics, back when Peter Molyneux could keep up with his big ideas. How the mighty have fallen! Anyway my review ;\n\nIt's no secret that this game is a spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper, and while I want to keep in mind that it is it's own beast and I shouldn't directly compare for the sake of biasing myself, inevitably, and inescapably, this is something that will be part of this review. Thankfully whether that's right or wrong, WftO in my opinion has nailed the atmosphere extremely well. The background hum of dank dungeon corridors and the deep, thumping beat of your dungeon heart, alongside your insidious sounding, witty assistant has thrown me back to my schooldays.\n\nDungeon design itself I have mixed feelings about. There doesn't seem to be as much of an incentive to place down traps or dig your dungeon out in areas to encompass rooms and a necessity to mine out entire areas to make use of the tiles you get is apparant.\n\nI feel like the actual map sizes don't compliment the number of rooms given particularly well, even if the rooms themselves are well thought out in terms of theme and function. Something as simple as converting particular rooms and their functions into room addons may be able to accomodate this where it makes sense - The Sanctuary's functions placed in the centre of a library with an expensive altar for example, or unlocking an arena pen to attract your Beast Master which you could then place on the grounds of an expansive and somewhat barren Beast Lair to fill it out.\nI would assume at least for the campaign, fiddling with map sizes would require a horrendous amount of work, so combining rooms with a usefulness that seems somewhat saturated would possibly be a good direction. Some rooms feel a little empty and as a whole the sheer number of room types doesn't translate well to the room you tend to have on each map.\n\nThe maps themselves from a campaign standpoint are well thought out, the variation of mission types is welcome and I'm glad as it brings a particular flavour to each map which allows you to apply your creativity in different ways. Dungeon planning was always a big part of Dungeon Keeper and I feel like the variation offered in each map is similar enough to give you that "lets get to work, I got this" feel, without making everything too samey and keeping you on your toes somewhat.\n\nMy biggest gripe is creatures and battle. I have found myself a few times leaving rally flags sitting up against an enemy keeper after all but wiping each other out, resulting in a 30 minute long battle that pumps every level 1 spawn on either side into one place until something ever so slightly tips the balance. It doesn't feel decisive enough to be satisfying, as does the level increases for each minion. Level 5 and 6 creatures feel somewhat irrelevent, especially when you consistently go up against them in the campaign with swathes of level 1s, and having a level 10 creature doesn't have that feeling of acomplishment that DK had.\nThere is a feeling of overwhelming higher level units which again is not a good thing - I just feel like something is missing when it comes to how satisfying this is. I feel like more emphasis should be placed on the power of each level and battles should feel a little more decisive, in return I'd welcome a higher difficulty although I understand if some people would be put off by this.\n\nAnother couple pointers is the minimap. More clarity would be helpful, as would a little more intuitiveness in regards to what's going on where. And the hand! The actual reference point is lost on the hand and I really feel this needs redesigned to better handle some of the UI. The rally flags on the left for example require pinpoint precision to the point where the concentration to do so successfully is immersion breaking, and I regularly find myself missing torture racks when I try to drop heroes, even when it feels otherwise.\n\nBugs I don't particularly want to go into - Every time I check my downloads on Steam there's another massive patch and I'm quite happy to hold off negativity regarding this (which other than a restart of a map due to a broken ritual doesn't bother me. If you're playing this kind of game specifically to win the map you're on then I suggest you sit back, relax and enjoy letting your creativity run wild instead!), but it's nice to see so much work getting put into addressing issues that other players may have a harder time dealing with.\n\nAll in all, WftO is a great spiritual successor to DK, most definitely one of the best, you can see from the outset that the team really understands the intricacies and have most definitely made it their own while paying homage. I love to see what happens next and all in all I'm very satisfied with backing Subterranean.\n\nWhether you're an old player or new to the whole concept, I suggest you take a look, regardless of whether it's for nostalgia or just for a new experience. I hold DK in a VERY high regard and consider Bullfrog part of a golden age which wasn't swamped by corporate fatcats, and true creativity was something to be welcomed and encouraged. I'm very happy to see a dev team capture the essence of this in a way that really pays homage to the concept as a whole. A modern DK has been a long time coming and I'm glad to say it's almost there. Just a little more work Subterranean, a touch more clarity and you got this.\n\nKeep up the good work, you won over a venerable Keeper!","April 5, 2015","true","12.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The problem is the game lag quite a bit in certain areas. Also the mini map is about as usefull as a butter knife. Other problems is that the game has some user interface issues. For example the keeper will ask you to click on the flashing tile to place an object however there is no queue as to where this tile might  be and until you find it you cannot click other actions. With no feedback you are left in the darkness about what to do next.\n\nIn the current state I would not recommend this to anyone who is new to the DK series.

Do I recommend War for the Underworld? Yes.... and a tiny bit no. Yes because what is there is great; I know there are a lot of people talking about this being the best of its type since Dungeon Keeper, and without a doubt they will be right. However the "no" part comes because there is still work to be done on it. This said however, I have to say that the devs are listening to what people are saying, (this is not true of all early access games), and they admit that there is a way to go to fulfill the potential that this game offers.\n\nThe gameplay is just what I was hoping for. There are areas that need to be polished, the graphics need to be optimised and more demons would be great. Both of these are targeted for work, the list is available on the steam store page.\nThe demons are lovely; the graphics are just right, the lighting is perfect and this gives the feel that you need for this type of game. To complete an action, be it destroy a wall or lay a flagstone, takes time but this is not too long and I don't think too quick either. Multiple workers will flood into an area if there is plenty of work to do and tackle multiple jobs. This means that you are not haging around waiting for stuff to happen; always a good sign.\n\nAm I happy with the game? Yes, most definitely. Could I be happier? Well, I suppose so; once the graphics are optimised and there are more demons and rooms. That said, I know that this is an early access game and I am not playing a game that is finished. I am playing a game that is in development and is actively be developed, unlike some other early access games. Will you enjoy it? If you enjoyed Dungeon Keeper and have missed it then yes, buy it now. If you  enjoyed Dungeon Keeper and have missed it but want the polished, optimised game so you can get on with building your own little underworld then perhaps you should wait a bit longer. But I have to say that I am glad I am in at this stage for this game; some of the early access games seem to be a way of earning extra cash for the developers who have no intention of producing a finished product. I am pleased to report that I would be extremely surprised if this is one of those!!!!\n\nEDIT:\nThe latest update has added better optimised graphics so that is one of my comments being looked at along with new minions and rooms, what more could someone ask for?\nSo far I am right about the developers caring about this game. Every week we find out what is happening with the game and, unlike some early access projects what they talk about is then actually acted upon and implemented.

But beware things are a little different this time.....\n\nAt first, I was weary of the deviations from DK2 (of which there are many), and wasn't exactly sure if I liked it or not, but over time, I've come to believe this game is actually an improvement on the original.\n\nPros:\n+Relive DK2 fun in a new and challenging way.\n+Map editors\n+Great game mechanics (skills trees, mana locking, sanctuarys etc.)\n+Multiplayer\n\nCons:\n-Relentless AI (surely this can be toned down?)\n-The add crash or glitch (particulary on multiplayer)\n\nThe single player is great fun, and a great way to learn how the new game functions. My main grievance is just how relentless the AI is. It really is ridiculously hard sometimes.\n\nFeatures such as mana locking and skills tree seem annoying at first, but you begin to realise that it's a mechanic that actually makes gameplay far more enjoyable in the long run.\n\nFor me the multiplayer is the best (and sometime worst) part of the game. This is the closest I've come to reliving those glory days of LAN'ing DK2 with friends, so I can't recommend this game enough for this reason alone. My main frustration comes from the odd crash when a large battle starts (which lets be honest, was far more regular on the orginal DK2). The game is far less geared toward defence (compared with DK2), so rather than lengthly stalemates, games can be won/lost within half an hour or so.\n\nIn short, this game is will delight those familiar with DK2, but will still provide a new challenge with it's tweaking on the mechanics. There are still the odd glitches which need to be ironed out, but these are few and far between, and don't effect the overall enjoyment of the game.\n\n","April 19","true","26.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

First impression, stutter before the menu loaded, then the button disappeared whenever I hovered over them, then when I finally manager to change screen resolution I had to force shut the application and restart to get it working again. On load the second time menu items white checkerboard everywhere, glitching and lagging into the campaign menu. I so want this game to be good.\n\nInto the first level, seems fairly okay, dialogue lines are being repeated randomly, adnimations are a bit wooden, but whatever, nostalgia overload - graphics are pretty awesome and Richard Ridings sounds awesome - I could see it being stellar. Second level, well I had to play the first one again for whatever reason, but when it eventually loaded the first condition of with selecting a "Vein of Evil" couldn't be done because it wasn't an option on the panel, trying to exit the game I had to force quit because once again the menu wouldn't load.\n\nI can't believe after a couple of years this game is still unplayable. I've seen how much work the devs have put in, but I just get the impression it launched too soon (maybe for cashflow reasons), and it's several revisions in and still pretty unplayable, at least for me.\n\nI want this game to be good, guess I'll check back in after another few versions to see if it's sorted yet.","October 16, 2015","false","3.5"," 41 of 74 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","41","74","5","4"

If you are fans of the good old bullfrog games such as theme hospital, theme parks, DK , you will be absolutely in love with this game , which I would suggest you get this game right now to support the developers .  Else you can wait for the full game release which is currently scheduled to be released in early 2015\n\n\nWas a big fan of the dungeon keeper series , can't tell you how excited I am when I heard about this game . Missed the chance to pledge for the project on kickstarter , the moment it released on Steam I got it right away .    The developers of the game are really hardworking , they have updates on the game quite frequently and new information every week and often hold live stream sessions on twitch.tv to answer questions from the players .  They are really passionate about the game and its that enthusiasm you had to admire .  Throughout all these times , I have seen massive improvement in the game, from  barely playable stage to fully voiced tutorial maps , dozen of rooms to build and constant improvement on the creature A.I  .

Especially fun if you like the Dungeon Keeper series. It felt like "Dungeon Keeper 3" to me, which I really consider a compliment!\n\nPro'sReally brings you back to the good old days, playing the bad guy for once instead!\nVery original strategy game, trying to attract creatures based on certain rooms\nTakes many good ideas from the Dungeon Keeper series and improved on them or made quality-of-life improvements\n\nConsCreature spawning mechanics and dictating which creatures you get are two things I still don't understand. Certain rooms attract certain creatures, but which ones spawn and how many you can get max etc. confused me all the way up to the end\nThere's no "priority list" like in games such at the Settlers where you can force certain actions to have priority over other. For example where to bring defeated monsters (to the crypt, or the prison for.. other uses? :D ).\nIt felt easier than the Dungeon Keeper series. Then again I was younger when I played that so it could've been due to that, too.\nI would've loved if the game had even more rooms and "forces" you to decide on a certain build, like focussing on sorcery, invest heavily into beasts, conversion of enemies, traps & alchemy, or just raw muscle power via the training room. Right now you can do everything really well and I often ended up trying to challenge myself by picking one.\n\nAll in all, an awesome game!","May 8","true","13.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I think that this fact is pretty relevant for this review. It is tha digging and room building that I loved quite muche these days and still do. Besides being the evil guy is always quite tempting, isn't it? Of course it is! Therefore I am really happy that War For The Overworld managed to breathe new life into this uniue genre. What follows is a list about different game mechanics that I like and don't like.\n\nRooms:\nWFTO managed to bring the rooms that the player built in Dungeon Keeper back to life and developes it further. The player needs ingame to dig for new space and build rooms in that space. These rooms vary in size and purpose even more than they did in Dungeon Keeper. The player uses these rooms to attract humanoids and beasts, trains them and makes them happy or uses rooms to increase the own power with spells.\nRooms get 1+ from me!\n\nSpells:\nWhat I like is that WFTO did't just copy rooms and spells from Dungeon Keeper into the game, but created many unique spells that come in form of, well spells but also in potions that can be made in certain rooms. Also rituals let the player feel quite evil and unstoppable while he fullfills the ritual simulatiously with preventing the heroes from docking at the door.\nAlso Spells get 1+ from me!\n\nTraps, Weapons, Buildables:\nThe player not only builds rooms, but also traps and other stuff to make the underground its home and its enemies hell. The buildable stuff that the player can choose from varies a lot, but I dont want to tell you about this for spoiler reasons. See youself and have fun!\nBuildables get 1+ from me!\n\nDownside!:\nWFTO also has its problems, at leat with my computer. At a certain point ingame it starts to lag and can be stopped by turning down the graphics. I believe that this is a problem that will be solved as I write this review, because the game just released to version 1.0 and will be updated further.\n\nConclusion:\nWFTO is the Dungeon Keeper successor that I always wished to get! Well okay I cant get to the overworld which I wished for after Dungeon Keeper 2, but damnit! We have enough games for beating somebody up in the overworld.\nIn my opinion WFTO is a musthave game for fans and newcomers!\n","April 2, 2015","true","36.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

However, I wouldn't recommend playing it early - what is there presently s very solid and produced to a high standard, but developing a game properly takes time and this is more of an investment in my eyes. A game that is shaping up to be fantastic but due to a focus on doing things properly and promptly as opposed to just quickly, functionality is still lacking compared to what the final product should offer.

I waited until the bumpy release to buy it, and so far, I haven't run into any bugs other than an occassional spike in lag when I use the ritual which reveals the whole map at once for ten seconds.\nThe art is mostly pleasing, though I tend to like how the hero faction's theme was designed more than the standard Underlord theme. The game so far does a good job at introducing you to key concepts without making the tutorial seem dull, even for an RTS/Dungeon Keeper 1/2 player like me. The campaign can be challenging at times, but a little easy at others. As of now, there are few skirmish maps, but there will be a patch soon that will supposedly add quite a number of maps, which has me pleased. The best thing, though, would be to release a map editor to conjoin with the steam workshop or something so that the game makers can allow the community to create their own maps.\nFor personal tastes, I like and have a hard time accepting this game at times. I like how diverse you can make your forces on the campaign, but limiting things in skirmish maps based on technology (Sin) trees seems silly in the sense that if I play long enough, I'd like to have access to everything available, rather than be limited in what I can do longterm. Along with that, I have a problem with the types of available creatures in the game- nothing seems to be like an "end-game" level creature other than the super-creatures, which you can't upgrade or train at all, and you can only ever get one. While I LOVE the hero units because I like the idea of having my own super minion, I'd like for the "1" on their HP flower to be a non-number icon, or to allow the supers to level to 10. This would clear up confusion like how I had when I spent a massive amount of time on XP potions in an attempt to level up my Eternal minion. Continuing on this creature-focused section, I think there should be more "high-end" creatures. Right now, the best creatures at the further points of the Sin tree are mostly casters or support-type creatures. The exception to this are the Shadow/Bafu, which in all honesty are not THAT beefy (I'm thinking Black Knights from DK2), and are difficult to train since the Beastmasters can't train the creatures as quickly as some of your intelligent minions can train. To be fair, though, it seems that the beast talent path is designed for aggro strategies, which means their high-end units won't be that incredible. The neutral tree basically only offers casters, which are all nice to have at times, but they don't offer a real frontline other than with the horde of ghouls your Necromancers can build up over time. That being said, the necromancers themselves are incredibly vulnerable to well-placed lightning strikes from your opponents, which can make all of the hard work from your ghoul farming go to waste in a matter of seconds. The defense tree offer the Augre, which is as close to a true tank of a non-super minion. Even so, they are not exactly what I was hoping for. What I hope for in the future, is an addition of the variety of creatures in both theme and purpose. Right now it seems that the main design of the creatures is "beast/beast humanoid," with a couple of demons and a human and a couple of undead for spice. While I love the addition of the beasts and all, it would be great to have more "dark humans," demons, and undead to accompany the beasts abd beast-men.\n\n~~~~~~TLDR:\nPros:\n-Keeps the Spirit of DK2 gameplay\n-Campaign has good pace for the most part\n-Few Bugs now\n-Gameplay is mostly fun\n\nCons:\n-Rocky release\n-Lag when using a very specific ritual\n-Lag if you keep the game runing on the main menu for too long (occasionally)\n-No map editor\n\nWould be cons if they weren't being fixed:\n-Low amount of Skirmish Maps (adding more soon)\n-Bugs in Survival Mode (fixing soon)\n\nPersonal Preference Stuff:\n-Creature diversity seems to be off (Too many beastial types and not enough demons/humans/undead/other)\n-Narrator sounded better as a snide aide/friend (DK2) as opposed to an arrogant, omniscient demon god\n-The narrator can be hilarious at times\n-The voice acting on the enemy dungeon lords is very good at times\n-The graphics are pleasing","May 9, 2015","true","21.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The gameplay is a breath of fresh air in an industry over saturated with Indie Devs creating stale replications of more popular games.\n\nThis game features dungeon building (which is amazingly satisfying), RTS elements. And economic balancing. Kind of a Towns/RTS if you will. The game features 4 modes, Campaign. Survival, Skirmish, and sandbox. (Multiplayer skirmish)\n\nCampain acts as a story setting and tutorial for the game's research system, building and running your dungeon effectively. With brilliantly evil voice acting, fun and exciting missions that challenge your abilities as an Underlord. Campaign will keep you busy for hours and help you refine your skills as an underlord.\n\nSkirmish is unfinished but the basic format for a skirmish game is 2 or more Underlords facing off in an attempt to destroy eachother's dungeon core (Larger player games are being worked on) This game gives you a fully unlocked Veins of evil tree to research the rooms nessesary to defeat the opposing player.\n\nSurvival is very much what is says on the box, and like skirmish, is still relatively under construction. Survival places you in a premade dungeon and gives you 3 lanes to defend where opposing heroes will try and breach your dungeon's defences and destroy your core. Sounds simple right? Its hard. Really hard. Good luck.\n\nAnd sandbox, a dungeon building wonderland, where the game gives you the freedom to construct a dungeon of ludicrous size, and this mode, as free as it is, will only last you a certain amount of time, as the lack of enemy contact makes it feel.. empty at best after all of your rooms have been made.\n\nAt the time of review I can give this game my approval and definetly recommend this to any person who is a fan or the original Dungeon keeper series. And anyone who is a fan of RTS and "Towns" Style games. But do not be afraid to try if you normally stray away from these styles of games! This game has somthing for everyone, and deserves as many sales as possible.\n\nHowever, this game is still for the most part, an unfinished release and I have to deduct points for that. But the negatives far outweigh the positives in my eyes, and everyone should keep this game in mind, even if you don't plan on buying immediately post lauch. Please keep this in mind.\n\nCredit is given where credit is due as Subterranean games breaths fresh life into a industry that is lacking new ideas recently (At least in my opinion) This game is a work of art and deserves your money.\n\nI rate this game a solid 6/10 in its current state. I'm sure the score will rise to a 7/10 or a 8/10 in coming patches.\n\nI have had tremendous fun so far with this game, and cannot wait for more content to arrive as Subterranean games have promised in free updates post launch.

I have supported this game for a long time and watched it grow. If you are looking for a dungeon management/ rts like game, then this si the one you should get. The voice acting is fantastic. Some of the quotes in the game caught me completely off guard while I was playing, for instance he says, "You did buy this game right?" while I was taking forever to clear a campaign level. Also, the AI in the game has a great range for all skill types. You can put it on easy as you learn the game, and there is even a specific AI that was built, which opperates in the rules of the game, that is near impossible to beat. Thus, there is challenege for all players. I have just finished my forst 10 hours of the game and I cannot wait to put many more in.\n\nNow to talk about how everyone is complaining about the bugs in the game:\nYes , there are some bugs in the final release and not all modes are fully functional and in prototype phase. The game is fun to play now, reguardless of bugs. Also, the dev's for this game are amazing. It has only been out for a day and there has been 4 or 5 updates in fixing to fix the bugs. Yes, some people are frustrated with the bugs, but I feel as if the game is very enjoyable even with them. Some features like survival are still in prototype and will be fully functional in the near future. I wanted to comment on the fact that I have played the survival prototype and it works very well as is.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game and it was worth the few years wait in order to enjoy this game. The dev's are great with their community and I see them respond in the forums daily. Do not walk away from this game just because of a few bugs. Buy it, enjoy it, and tell others the same so this game doesn't die due to others throwing a fit over a few bugs.","April 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

The game sure needs more polishing, especially in the technical areas, to have it run smoother and less resource demanding, but despite that it´s fun ...and that´s what counts in the end, eh?\n\nBig plus on the voice acting side, the atmosphere while playing is fantastic, really nostalgic.

The game is also much more stable as it was when I wrote this review. The developers now also actively involve the users of WFTO in testing the game; they now often release previews in which the newest features and fixes are available at a seperate beta-branch at Steam. WFTO also works well if you have a low-end-machine, so don't worry about that. And if it does not work right on your low-end-machine; the developers will do more optimatization to WFTO in the comming versions, so it even runs faster as it already does! :)\n\nThis will maybe be even better then Dungeon Keeper; it now has a lot of rooms, many characters and very nice graphics. The 20 euros are worth it! The developers give everyone even acces to pre-beta, so you can test the newest content and maybe even report bugs to help the developers finisching this game ;) They publish at least once a week news on their main website about the development progress and answer a lot of questions on their forums. Never saw that kind of developers with so much humor! :)\n\nThey have fixed many bugs and crashes in the last months; I can surely say it's playable, you will sometimes maybe see a tiny little bug or a very rarely crash (got a few ones so far,) but you can play the levels like a charm. WFTO even contains a debug mode and debug console with which you can mess around with the game :)\n\nThere are known problems about that you can only play an old version of WFTO on Mac OSX at the moment, but this is not caused by WFTO itself; it is a bug at the Unity side and the Unity team is working on resolving this issue for everyone, so you will probably soon be able to play the latest version of this game on MAC OSX soon! See here for more updates on this: https://forum.subterraneangames.com/threads/488-osx-version-of-the-game-is-not-up-to-date.4981/\n\nThey are still working on polishing the UI, AI, graphics etc (but you can play it very well at the moment!). But it's worth to buy it now already and help the developers to finish the game, but the game is now also a little bit cheaper then after the release!!!

Game is fully polished and well-optimised now, which makes for a much more enjoyable experience. Worth the full price, extremely worth during a sale.\n\n(Very) Long Review:\nI backed this during the Kickstarter crowdfunding phase, and was an avid fan of DK1 and 2. Bias confirmation confirmed, but this review is as objective as I can make it.\n\nOverviewWar for the Overworld is the spiritual successor to the cult hit Dungeon Keeper, a series by Bullfrog (later snapped up by EA - which is why DK3 never. ;_;).\nYou play as an 'Underlord', a wibbly wobbly non-corporeal being that seals its essence in a Dungeon Core (the room you start with in every game). Lose that and you lose the game; protect it at all costs.\nBut in order to enact your will (and defend said Core), you gain access to an assortment of rooms,\n\nThe Good\n- You're the bad guy!\n\n- Very polished. Backers and early buyers remember the... fiasco that was WFTO's launch (although they did explain why it released the way it did, which was understandable); it's come a long way since then. Virtually all bugs have been fixed, many quality-of-life features have been implemented/improved and the optimisation is much better.\n\n- Unique. Although a successor to DK, there's nothing else like this on the market at the moment. WFTO isn't a carbon copy of DK either; it has its own fantasy, creatures and ideas (most notably, Potions and Rituals).\n\n- Build your own Dungeon. One of the major attractions, you can build your Dungeon however you feel like (within the constraints of the map terrain, of course). If you want a massive open-plan ground, meticulously divided rooms full of doorways and corridors, then you can do it. (A more recent addition was Wall prop efficiency; to offset the fact you have less building space, rooms with reinforced walls will operate more effectively.)\n\n- Playstyle variety [outside of the Campaign]. Every game, you'll start with no abilities or rooms unlocked, spending Sins (points) in a three-column Tech Tree to unlock stuff. You can rush for a specific tree's Titan, or you can spread Sins across all three trees. That said, I don't think it's perfect (see below).\n\n- Entertaining. With Richard Ridings as your Mentor (the same VA for the DK Mentor) and the dark, tongue-in-cheek (and occasionally just plain silly) humour, it'll catch you out once in a while.That, with the excellent(ly awful) voice acting for the good guys makes for fun outside of the gameplay.\n\nThe Bad\n- Hotkeys. Hotkey support was enabled a while back, but the lack of visibility is a significant issue to learn hotkeys, especially if you're trying to micro combat / efficiency. Could easily be fixed by displaying the relevant hotkey in ability tooltips.\n\n- The AI. It's alright, but once you get to grips with the game, it becomes a lot easier to fight against. Also, there's no difficulty mode for the campaign; although the early missions are newbie-friendly, the difficulty curve rises quite significantly, particularly if you're new to this genre.\n\n- Hidden / unexplained mechanics. Following on from the previous point, the game introduces many additional utilities you can make use of. That in and of itself is a good thing; the lack of introduction and usage of them isn't great. There's still a few rituals and potions I never make use of, while others are pretty overpowered for their investment. There are user-written guides that provide in-depth explanations, but it shouldn't really be the place of the community to tell you how something functions in the first place.\n\n- Meta playstyles Lack of depth to Tech Tree. Having tested a defensive strategy against Master AI, I can confirm that defensive strats do indeed work (Avarice + WDs, all I'm saying), though I can't see them being as effective vs players. Nevertheless, Although there are options and optimal choices do vary from map to map, I still feel more could be done to promote tech / build diversity. Possibly passive buffs (and nerfs?) for certain units when you invest into certain trees, or passives that only activate from speccing into multiple trees to complement your playstyle.\n\n- RAM usage. I have 8GB RAM (DDR3, meh clock speed), but on larger maps I will start to lag; it's still playable, but everything goes slower and commands won't always register. For optimal experience you'll want 12 or 16GB, but it's fine on small/medium sized maps.\n\nConclusionCongrats for getting this far!\nOverall, I would strongly recommend picking this up (especially if it's on sale, but the devs definitely earned the money asked). Many of the negative reviews were released at launch, present issues that have since been addressed in virtually all cases. Most of the bad points are fairly minor, primarily to do with communication and visibility.\n\nYes, it's not Dungeon Keeper 3; but that's fine. I personally believe it's better that WFTO is its own game, drawing inspiration from DK but not trying to become it.","March 23","true","121.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

They even have Richard Ridings doing the narration as he did for DK1 & 2!! It's like Dungeon Keeper all over again but without the soul sucking presence of a corporate publisher involved to make it suck with their stupid marketing surveys. Awesome!\n\nSo I finally got around to playing the official 1.0 release of this game that launched back in April? I think, and I have to say that it feels pretty good to know that my original review during its time in SEA still holds up to the last twenty-ish or so hours of gameplay I've experienced in the past couple days.  Even though I've yet to encounter something that even comes close to the awesomeness of the Horned Reaper character from the original DK series, WFO is definitely the DK successor I've been wanting since my obsession with replaying DK2 ended so many years ago.\n\nOne negative point brought up in the more critical reviews that I've read so far stated something like there were too many spells, rituals, constructs, etc and that they themselves only needed one or two spells to complete the game so every other option they didn't use at the time was considered to be unnecessary content.  I agree that there are a lot more options than there ever was with the previous DK series but all the same, I find that having a lot of variety helps the replay value of the game.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, I do think that the narrator is a bit too chatty some times and as much as I love Richard Ridings from the DK series, it did get to be a bit much at times.   Yet all the same, I can't blame the developers for wanting to get as much mileage out of the legacy asset of RR's voice as they possibly could because so much of the DK vibe comes from his voice alone.\n\nSo anyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the Dungeon Keeper series or to anyone who thinks the game looks interesting because it is really well done and I find myself easily losing hours while playing, which is exactly what I would expect from the spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper.","July 1, 2014","true","38.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This genre of game is unique in a sense that you are the evil. You build a kingdom but you cannot control those who join your cause and your style of building defines what archetype of mobs join you.\n\nI must say that for a game that has just released it is to be expected to have a slightly buggy experience, however in this case there really are bugs everywhere. The game feels unfinished. When you open up the menu after installing and click multiplayer the first thing that prompts up is, this will be patched in. The same happens when you click survival mode, and when you click skirmish there is a shocking three maps. The only fully functional mode as of right now is the campaign. This was already a huge letdown, minutes after finishing my download.\n\nI didn't let it phase me and I went for the campaign. Now from the very start I ran into bugs and problems. As a former dungeon keeper player and with many games behind my belt I have a good idea on how to play games. Now this is very important because the tutorial is horrible. They barely scrape the surface of what buildings do, there is no explanation what so ever how the controls work. I was unable to move my camera, had issues with targetting. You'd figure okay, I will read the tooltips but frankly, there are no useful tooltips anywhere in the game to be found. Mostly there are placeholders from an early alpha build. "shrine prop siege" doesn't tell me what it does? The big thing for this game is the micro management of the buildings, however there is no explanation on how the sizes of your exhibits have to be in order to recruit units. The props are invisible. And you can slap units but there is no real talk on how it affects efficiency.\n\nSo I went in completely blind. Now the early campaign maps are fairly easy, straightforward objectives and simple tasks. With no time pressure that is good. The only problem is that you cannot build anything else while you have a certain task. Build a X on this tile. Then you cannot continue to do what you were doing, it forces you to do something specific, some of the cutscene 'talks' appear to be unskippable and this is just tiny annoyances everywhere.\n\nI pushed onward, in a quite bad mood now. And then I encountered many little bugs. I summoned a vampire, it went mad. Started killing my units but I had no idea how to fix that. Everytime I cast a scouting ritual my pc froze up completely. Now I have a really expensive modern pc less than two months old. That is just bad scripting. Lag, delay and crashes occurred regulary. I had units bug into the wall and frankly no idea what half of the spells, flasks or shrines are for. The possesion spell, which was a huge thing, is completely broken.\n\nSo yes. I did finish the campaign. It took me roughly 12 hours. I only had to restart one map which I failed on my part. So through the buggy experience I can say that the campaign has a good design, it is versatile and interesting. The small storyline has a funny plot to it. But its so dissatisfyingly short, and the experience was a chain hindrance of little problems that I can't say I fully enjoyed it. There was no map that was challenging in the entire campaign and by the time most buildings and plots are revealed you are done.\n\nI then decided to take on the AI in skirmishes just to see what the full experience would be like. Considering I hadn't had that strong opponents in the campaign. Now I took on every AI setting on master, they were challenging. So I will say that the game definatly has potential. It is fun in design, fun in concept and I'm sure that with some more patches and content this will be a good game. For those who have seen the totalbiscuit WTF video, what he says is very true. This game looks like it will be worthwhile, in 6months or more to come. As of right now, I cannot recommend this game. I personally found it fun, but I am dissapointed in what I consider a premature release and I hope the developpers will put effort into this game, and make it great. As I think it can be.","April 20, 2015","false","17.7"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","20","35","2","0"

They kept the flavor of the original game, making it easy to make the transition. So far as I could tell, there's all the same elements of the original game, dungeon building, room optimizing, cheating your minions out of their pay, slapping and torturing them, etc.\n\nThere's also some very good new features, like control groups and invisible-fence-for-imps, that were missing from the original. The graphical update makes it a very nice looking game, although by no means cutting edge or demanding.\n\nThis does mean, however, that the game is not much of a change from the original. There's no radically new gameplay, just some tweaks, a graphical update and a new story.\n\nAlso, the minimap is unnecessarity pixelated, and the game uses so much memory! It uses 2.5GB more memory than Tomb Raider 2013, and about 1GB more memory than vanilla Rome II. I can't imagine what all that memory is used for, since Rome II handles more units and has better texture. Given this and some other reviews, I'm inclined to think that optimization is not very good, and systems with slower/less RAM will stutter due to paging issues.","December 15, 2015","true","27.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","1"

If your new to the "franchise" buy it still, you won't regret it, especially if you love dark humour and room building.\n\n\nAs many others have written, this game brings the tear for nostalgia running down your cheek when you launch the first mission. The Dungeon Keeper and DK2 aspect of this game is there, the room building, even the imps have the same animation. I was so surprised how close to the "old thing" it was, and how well the old games bugs and glitches were fixed.\n\nAs I said, it's quite the nostalgia trip.\n\nOne thing to note though, and I'm sure the devs of this game are aware and trying to fix is that this game has a minor memory leak on longer sessions. Approx. 6 hours in you'll start to freeze lag etc, but is easily fixed through killing the program and starting again, just remember to save your progress. :)\n\nOne thing that I'd hope is that this game would somehow intertwine the story of where DK2 was headed, as the story was awesome, even though the animation was crap in todays world. But I did feel like the story did somehow intertwine a little with DK2 and DK1 especially.\n\nAnother request for the developers is the lack of Windowed Fullscreen mode :)\n","May 28","true","15.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

However at the time of first looking at this game it had mostly negative reviews, so I stayed away. Checking back recently I noticed that suddenly the reviews were hugely positive, with people praising the developers most recent updates (1.1 and 1.2) and saying the game was now polished and worth playing. Due to the Halloween sale I picked it up to give it a try. I am not disappointed!\n\nThis game takes all the things that made dungeon keeper great and maintains the legacy. It felt so familiar to me that it was like playing dungeon keeper all over again. The campaign has some challenging levels to keep you on your toes and a great entertaining narrated voice over (From the same voice actor that did DK2!!)\n\nA small gripe I have is how insane the AI is, on skirmish they somehow always end up with 3-4x as many minions as you within minutes. I am not sure if this is because I suck or because the AI is just mentally good but it does make my desire to get all the achievements a huge challenge!\n\nOverall this game is very polished and any dungeon keeper fan should try it and love it! One thing I have noticed which makes me incredibly supportive (Supportive enough to write a review, which I have never done before) Is that the developers listen! every review I check the developers have commented saying that they will work on that, they seem to genuinely care for the player base, which these days is a rare thing! So Kudos devs for listening to players and actually acting on it! You have a happy customer from me and another positive review.

What a journey - and I have to give credit where credit is due to the developers, in regards to their time, effort, and the way they've interacted and responded to the community feedback.\n\nThe game itself - in my opinion is everything we could have hoped for, if there ever was an official DK3. Updated graphics, new (very inventive) units, spells, skills; but of course all the original charm of the series we love, including the voice work! :)\nReally enjoying playing this, and presume I will contunue to do so for some time.

Yeah. You can't escape the fact that this is the game that you buy if you wanted a Dungeon Keeper 3 (or a decent DK2).  You will typically start the game looking for a creature portal, building rooms for sleeping, eating and training, and finding the starting gold vain. Nothing new there.\n\nBut this game stands strong in it's own right. Obviously, it just isn't quite DK. Hating it for this seems to be a hobby for many fans. But the game deserves to be treated as though it stands on it's own: and it certainly can. If DK had never existed, this game would be hailed as an innovative marvel. Instead, it is simply a fun, workable game using the same formula.\n\nAn early example of a nice little innovation is the Tavern building: Minions will pay some of their wages back to you for cooked food and beer, but you need to keep it stocked, giving an interesting strategic choice. Things such as this give the game a feeling of depth without making it micro-manage hell.\n\nThe game is worth the money. You will have fun playing a dungeon-building strategy game. It is not DK.

Dunno...) that owns this game since the Bedrock Beta so I can tell you pretty well some negative and positive things about this game, but mostly negative....\n\nFirst and foremost I must admit that the guys at Subterrenean Games are working hard and passionate, however there are - as mentioned before - some very negative things that destroy the enjoyability of this game for me and will probably also for you...\n\n\nAbout the Bedrock Beta:\nThe Beta was actually an entire mess, there was almost nothing that actually really worked it even crashed regularly and gameplay lagged as hell...\nSo that what was actually called a "beta" was actually a public alpha version, but this wouldnt be a major problem if Subterrenean wouldnt have rushed the game out.\n\n\nAt release:\nThe game has been hastly released with alot of bugs from the "beta", apart of the lack of optimization for systems other than the developers.  The next disappointment was that who purchased the underlord edition didnt got everything as advertised. The soundtrack for example was missing and there was also no advertised guide. The soundtrack was added later (you buy something but you dont get the product you paid for...), dunno about the guide and I also dont care anymore...\n\n\nAfter release:\nIt took approximately 2 major updates (1.1 and 1.2) and several minor patches before, so that the game could be called "somehow" - and only somehow - a working game.\n\n\nThe latest major update (version 1.3) with a retrospective view:\nWell, at release of the game (version 1.0) I've first started playing the single player campaign of WFTO, however I gave up on playing the SP campaign because the campaign wasnt very balanced apart of the bugged necromancer mission (I think that was level 8...).\n\nWith 1.3 I was thinking about to give the SP campaign a new try, but before I wanted to play-test some skirmish matches against the AI because the long-awaited map-editor was also released with 1.3. That was a good chance to try both things...\n\nAfter creating my own map and playing it I've noticed a bugged minion and worker AI and a major slowdown of the FPS. I was really hoping with patch 1.3 that such performance and AI flaws would have disappeared but they didnt. Since the Bedrock Beta there were performance and AI problems. Of course they appeared less with every major update but the latest problems in 1.3 are enough for me, my patience is literally exhausted - especially if you go through this since the Bedrock Beta, sorry Subterranean but I'm fed up from this...\n\n\n\nTo the ones who are thinking to buy this game (read the above and now read the below pros/cons):\n\nPros:\n+ Richard Ridings as narrator\n+ Gameplay is almost the same as in DK1/2, although a bit faster than in the predecessors\n+ Sounds effects and sound atmosphere are very well done\n+ The AI is very efficient (but also see Cons)\n+ Different salutations by the narrator (Richard Ridings) at game startup, depending on the real computer clock\n+ Beasts are well chosen and animated\n+ (Patch 1.3): Map editor with mirroring function\n\n\nCons:\n- Minion leveling isnt well balanced, there is also no visual difference between a lvl 1 minion and a lvl 10 minion except the number stating the minion level... a level 10 minion could really need some anabolica that should lead into a visual difference...\n- The skirmish AI is very efficient but NOT very smart, the skirmish AI is good in going on your nerves but if you counter the skirmish AI it doesnt really know how to handle this situation.\n- The skirmish AI doesnt use nor place any defenses (doors/traps)\n- The skirmish AI doesnt use/activates artifacts\n- I disagree on certain regular minions in regards of their look (chunder f.e. rather looks like a ugly thin toy and not big fat bad ♥♥♥ like a bile demon) but this "look" topic is a matter of taste...\n- There is almost always somewhere an AI bug destroying the enjoyability of this game and which also often leads into performance issues, although the campaign might be unaffected by this because the campaign is rather more scripted than based upon the skirmish AI...\n\n\nConclusion:\nLet's sum it up\nBedrock Beta = Paid Alpha which was also known as Steam Early Access\nWFTO 1.0 - 1.x = Paid - almost have it working stable but still being a - Beta\nWFTO 1.x - ? = Final stable release... (ETA?)\n\nAll what I wrote sounds very negative but if you are a passionate DK 1 and/or DK 2 player and you still dont own WFTO you should get it in a sale. People that are interested in this game but never played a dungeon game like Dungeon Keeper before should wait maybe for the next 2-3 major updates. I will however start up the game again when the next major patch (1.4 maybe?) will arrive but until then I dont have the desire to start playing it again...","January 4","false","96.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","2"

It's not 'exactly' the same of course but close enough to make it great!\n\nTo me the couple of minor issues I did run into/noticed were a non-issue to me and I felt didn't take away from the gameplay in any significant manner.

Decided to revisit it after release for another look. Well, I have.\n\nThis game is so poorly-optimized as to be unplayable. The UI lags about 2-3 seconds behind your interactions with it. The tutorial level told me to cast the "Call To Arms" spell, which the UI didn't even present to me. (Then a few seconds later, said, "congratulations!" as if I had managed to cast it.) Things like casting a recall spell on a specific minion are virtually impossible, as they move faster than the UI allows you to cast.\n\nDespite setting the game to open fullscreen, every time I run it it draws a huge 1080p-sized window *inbetween* my two monitors. Why would it do that? Why would ever want to play a game that way?\n\nKeyboard keys won't work for scrolling the map. The only way to scroll the map is by sticking the mouse to one edge of it. This might be a setting in the UI, but I didn't want to spend the 26 minutes it would have taken to navigate to the options screen.\n\nIn addition to all of that, this isn't Dungeon Keeper 3. It's just an exact clone of Dungeon Keeper II, only very slightly more high-resolution. You might as well just buy DK2 on Gog.com and play it instead.","March 6","false","0.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

After which, I wondered if they were going to make a Dungeon Keeper 3. I was elated to hear that the answer was "yes and no". There would be a Dungeon Keeper 3, but it wouldn't be *called* Dungeon Keeper 3.\n\nThis game lives up to and surpasses my wildest expectations. It's fun, comical, challenging, and intense. This studio did an absolutely incredible job on this game, and I highly recommend it.\nThat being said, you should be prepared for a few bugs and glitches, at least at the time of this review. I am quite certain that they will get everything resolved at some point, but at the moment I've had to handle a few hair-pull worthy issues.\n\nAt one point, when hitting the ESC key to save my game, the game froze and eventually crashed on me. In another instance, two of my minions appeared to be stuck in a lake. They were wandering around in circles incessantly, clearly befuddled by why their master had abandoned them. Not to worry, though. A quick spanking or three sent them back on their merry way.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game.

It defeats the point of early access in my book.\n\nIt is now July 2015, 4 months after War for the Overworld was released and it finally has enough Skirmish maps to make it worth playing in single player. An update to Unity 5 seems to have improved performance too.\n\nIt has enough units, powers and spells to keep most dungeon keeper fans happy, and it brings enough of its own tricks to the table so it cannot be accused of being a straight forward clone of the old classic.\n\nIf it has any problem it is that it has too many rooms and monsters for most maps, you will find your self without the room to the build them all. So your going to have to choose what you want and what you do not want.\n\nPreviously I recommended this game but only just, stating a lack of maps and other unfinished features meant you would be left waiting to play it because it was not finished.\n\nAlso, previously, I said 7 out of 10 on metacritics user score was about right, it is now at 7.3 and rising on metacritics because the game is finally playable. In it is current state it is worth about an 8.\n\nThough the campaign pretty much sucks with its timers and shows a distinct lack of imagination, mind you so do the new maps.\n\nWhat is it with devs these days and their symetrical maps ?\n\nRecommended.... finally...","April 8, 2015","true","13.2"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","0"

To say that this is not what I received would be a lie but the thing is the game delivers things so clunkily that all enjoyment is simply sucked out of it.\n\nYes, you do build your own fully functioning dungeon... assuming you can figure out the actual mechanics of the game, that being the logistics behind the rooms and how the minions interract with them. You can have lots of fun reading through half finished tool tips and placeholders and see if you can make sense of it.\n\nYou do employ a workforce of diabolical minions... but again the game is not exactly forthcoming on details on how they function inside your dungeon and in combat which leads to cluster♥♥♥♥ combat scenarios in which you just pile your guys together and hope they come out on top.\n\nYou do conquer realms and bring ruination to your enemies... but through a story that appears to be missing half of its cutscenes and animations and this is assuming that the game doesn't crash or go through constant memory leaks.\n\nI guess you could say that this game delivers everything that was expected, but it is done so badly that all the fun gets lost behind somewhere.

However I see it's potential and over time I can recommend it. There are probably more cons so far than pros. Constant bugs, HUGE fps issues, no save, no multiplayer, only one mission. I know that the developers plan on adding more missions, a save, a multiplayer. However it has been over one year sense initial release of the beta and we still see no improvement BESIDES UI changes and more rooms/creatures. If you are a Dungeon Keeper fan you will love this game however I think you should wait till they properly finish this game. There are so many bugs and fps spikes its ridiculous and game breaking. (not sarcasm). At times every creature including your imps will freeze and do nothing, i tried all i can to get them to move. I picked them up, i slapped them, i controlled them, and they still wouldn't move. Also, once you build a large dungeon and have an army the lag is ridiculous. Even if you can handle skyrim on max settings you will have issues with the frames reaching a max 10 frames if you're lucky. However once you start a game you should have a solid 30 frames or more. Final Verdict: Save your money, get it upon release. To many bugs and problems at the moment.","May 18, 2014","true","3.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Game tends to slow down a lot over the course of playing and occasionally crashes (devs stated they are looking into solving this problem)\n\nWar for the Overworld is a refreshing change in the standard RTS genre given that you build a dungeon and attack the "good guys". As many know, WftO is the spiritual successor to Dungeon Keepers 1 and 2. This is the game I have been looking for since finishing DK 1&2 in 2000 (15 years!). I am sincerely happy that EA has allowed Subteranean Games to create this clear clone of the Dungeon Keeper franchise.\n\nDo not get me wrong, War for the Overworld is not just a facelift for Dungeon Keeper 2. It does have it's own story if you are a plot addict like me. However, the look and gameplay feels just like DK2 on the surface, but is a bit buggy with path finding which I expect will get ironed out. If you have been looking for another Dungeon Keeper look no further and pick this game up since it is what we wished that "Dungeons" was or "Overlord 1&2" were. It is certainly worth the $30 USD (half of what EA would charge if they made it, and it would not be as good) even though it does have some flaws as detailed above. I expect that these flaws will be polished away with a bit of time since these devs are extremely devoted to supporting their product and are enthusiasts themselves for the Dungeon Keeper series.\n\nBuyer with a low-end system beware (i.e. less than 8 GB RAM and less than a Quad Core processor running at 2.0 GHz) as this game is somewhat CPU and definitely memory intensive which manifests itself particularly during battles. I know this because I recently had to upgrade my system to run smoothly (I was capped at 3.25GB RAM and it bottlenecked my Quad Core AMD Phenom II @3.2GHz processor). If your system does not meet the minimum requirements, either upgrade or expect slow downs, stability issues, crashing, and even unplayability during gameplay, and don't downvote simply because your PC cannot handle it (I see this too often).\n\nAll these things being said, I cannot recommend this game enough. WftO is exactly as advertised with regard to being the spiritual successor to DK 1&2. I played this game when it was in early access and enjoyed it then and now even more. This is the only game that I have ever been happy with after purchasing in early access, and I have purchased a fair few.\n","April 8, 2015","true","42.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's pretty much Dungeon Keeper with more features.\n\nThe only problem I have is you get interrupted SO OFTEN to get told what to do. If you are trying to watch Netflix or something while playing, don't bother because it will get talked over by non-notification dialogue ALL THE TIME. Diatrabe after diatrabe. On top of that you will get straight up forced to place certain things in certain places before you are able to use them anywhere else. You are even sometimes forced on a frozen screen while things are happening around you to perform certain actions. I got slid over to a room as I was about to give a dig command and it caused me to accidentally set a dig command on one of my outer walls that I could not undo because I was frozen on the other room until I finished the task.\n\nIt's a lot of very forced and heavy handed tutorial style tasks that I would absolutely love if you could turn off, but I'm not holding it against the game because even though I'm 5 missions in and they are still doing it I am really hoping that they knock it off sometime soon.","April 8, 2015","true","40.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I was pleasantly surprised, because Im a total fan of the series.\n\nIf I dont give it a 8 or 9/10 is because the "sim/soul" part of the game is still lacking compared to all the other things. The creatures are different in appearance and some even in combat, but what about personality's? In the DK games you had the bile demon wanting tons of food, the dragons lots of gold, spiders hating flies, wizards wanting silence in their library's, dogs fertilizing your cementerys etc... Those things not only made you think about how to place rooms or witch creatures try to summon for X or Y lvl, but added a lot to the feeling of your dungeon being "alive" and populated by creatures with desires and/or uses for non room activity's.\n\nThe other thing is polish and pacing, but that is probably easier to fix with feedback and the experience the devs already gained by making the game. All in all, its a really good game that can be recommended to any DK fan.","July 8, 2015","true","19.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I am one of those people. I LOVE the DK franchise.  Anyways, going to try not mentioning DK/DK2 from here on out. Well, until the end, anyway\n\nWar for the Overworld is a dungeon building and managing god game.  You create your dungeon, create rooms, get minions, and level them up to get an advantage over your enemies. You create room, traps, use spells and Constructs. Depending on what you like and what your playstyle is, you can use or keep from using certain rooms or minions in sync with your playstyle. Hell, you could go all turtle style on your enemy if you wanted to.\n\nThis game also gives you a decent amount of defensive structures you can use, but from your limited resources, you won't be able to spam them all over the map. Which wouldn't be fun in the first place. Imagine a game where the enemy has turrets ALL over the map. Personally I'd just give the person a win and leave the current game. :P\n\nEvery game/movie/series has cliché's. This one is no different in that aspect. Lies, deceit, hero(es)/villain(s) gone batshit insane, plot twists, manipulation, 180 degree turn in personality, and so on and so forth. The usual. Though you can still get genuinely surprised by plot twists. Hell, I can see them coming miles away, and still get surprised. Must be the way the plot twists are handled.\n\nThis game breathe new life into the dungeon creating and managing-genre, which were severely lacking since the before-mentioned franchise. Which is kinda sad, as this type of genre is very fun.\n\nNow, this game was officially released on the 4th of April, 2015. Personally though, I feel as if this game is kinda still in the "just came outta beta" phase, where they add content, fix bugs/glitches, etc. I love free stuff. Hell, even if it's paid DLC(as long as it's cheap enough) I will most likely buy it, though free DLC/content is always welcome, especially for this unpolished gem of a game. In maybe a year and potent and efficient polishing, this game could and will be a lot more than what it is now, and even more worth the money I spent on this unpolished-so-far gem.\n\nNow, onto pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+ Fun to play\n+ Real Dungeon Keeper(2) atmosphere, and graphics to match\n+ Hilarious voice acting (Love ya, Richard!)\n+ Very good camera options\n+ AI is fully capable of tearing you a new one\n+ Large creature/minion variation\n+ Can train minions/creatures to max level\n+ Infinite in terms of different plays you can do\n+ Pretty fun campaign, though not exactly jaw-dropping\n+ Did I mention voice acting?\n+ Cool soundtracks\n+ Devs are talkative AND are both responsive and positive with feedback you give them\n+ Updates are scheduled and released and regular intervals, unlike for some other games I know\n+ Very interesting map designs\n+ All kinds of different map tiles, and how you interact with them\n+ The devs and a lot of us are passionate about this genre, and are huge fans of the Dungeon Keeper franchise (Omg, I mentioned it, please don't hit me)\n+ The mouse is a hand, which truly every evil Underlord(Keeper) needs!\n\nCons:\n- Lacking in terms of campaign duration\n- Not possible to change difficulty for campaign\n- Can be a bit difficult at times to select a minion/creature, or even simply hover over it to see status\n- Lacking multiplayer/skirmish maps\n- Only 4-players max currently, hoping/wanting to see more\n- Missing tooltip for when selecting AI's during skirmish, what their preferred strategies are, etc.\n- Seems laggy at times\n- A tad lacking in content, but this will come in time\n- Better minion/Creature overview is lacking\n- Kinda hard to select tabs at times because of small UI buttons (Rooms, Spells, etc.)\n- Some of the mechanics in the game are poorly described/explained\n- The mouse is at times hard to use, as the ingame hand you play with is a bit weird in terms of unit, room and environment interaction\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is good, fun, and catches the DK/DK2 type of gameplay. It's not perfect. Nothing is. But if you are thinking spiritually, this game could one day become the spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper 2.\n\nAnyways, this is my short review of War for the Overworld\n\nCheers,\nYakamaru","November 7, 2015","true","27.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I bought it, set it aside, and waited for the release message to check it out.\n\nThis is one of the very few games coming out of Early Access that truly realized their potential. It has everything - the exploration, the dungeon building, a large variety of creatures with different looks and likes/dislikes, in depth magic and room progression trees, and - of course - the ability to slap your imps.\n\n10/10 would back again.","May 28","true","17.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GruntLoc/recommended/230190/","GruntLoc","Grunt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GruntLoc/","116 products in account","Updated: An even more interesting alternative is actually an early access game called Dwelvers. The developers are amazingly active and immediately responsive to the community, fixing problems and implementing requests.\n\nDwelvers offers dungeon layers, cave ins and topside action, craftable equipment and all kinds of ♥♥♥♥. It's excellent and on the road to being my definitive choice so far as the DK successor.\n\n\nBack to WFTO - I do recommend the game as there's some good fun to be had (again) treating this as a DK 2.0 reboot.\n\nSome solid work was put into the game assets. The writing (in large measure) is also well done and they brought in Richard Ridings once again as mentor, and general grumpy evil scolder of things.\n\nThis isn't DK3 because that would involve finally breaking out onto the surface. From what I'm seeing that's not going to happen, unless WFTO is expanded - that would be great and all former DK fans would appreciate it.\n\nUnfortunately there's also some (IMO anyway) glaring contrived things, most notably - sand.\n\nSand is being used to artificially separate enemy assets from the player. You can't claim it, replace it, put down a sheet of steel (or stone, wood, magic or anything else) to create a connection to take over enemy tiles beyond it.\n\nIt's downright stupid, frankly. I think the developers may have decided to use this because they didn't want to go to the effort of dealing with (a lot of added) level design complexities and logic where the player can capture (or cross and continue to capture) empire tiles beyond the single sand tiles carefully laid out as this silly barrier.\n\nI'm calling this out because it may seem low priority but it's actually not. Part of the interest for many of DK is taking over every inch of the underworld, one map at a time.\n\nAnother issue more toward "imposed balance" is mana (and worker) caps. They've done the system in a way explicitly limiting the players ability to create truly massive defensive systems sprawled across the underworld.\n\nThere are other things lacking as well.\n\nBut, it's 2015, the game as-is has without question had a lot of work put into it much of which is good quality. Far more than not it is definitely an updated take on the DK series with some things that used to be fun not implemented or allowed at all.\n\nFor long time DK fans it's still worth a romp and visually it looks great. I still have my original DK1 + 2 CD's, bonus packs and maps I made sitting on a NAS. And I've played both as recently as last year on W7. Takes just a little work then the games work perfectly.\n\nFor those without DK experience you should go get and play both of them if you really want to understand and appreciate where WFTO is coming from.\n\nIt should (or hopefully) be possible to use an editor to change the core campaign maps to eliminate the stupid sand or (even better) change the properties of sand to make sense (claimable).\n\nThe DK editor doesn't by default allow saving campaign maps but that's easily gotten around and allowed players to fine tune campaign maps to suit how they wanted to play it, in every regard.\n\nHopefully the WFTO map editor is at-least as capable. I've no idea, yet.","September 25, 2015","true","50.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a similar sense of humor, but maybe a bit more drab than the old DK franchise. I can see that the devs loved DK and wanted to make this as close to that concept as possible, but in too many places it falls just shy of the potential.\n\nThe old Dungeon Keeper games had some bad bugs in them that made them almost inplayable at times and unfortunately this game does follow that same trend as well. That being said, the devs have not given up on this game and appear to be trying to fix, improve, and expand on the game months after it's full release, so here is to hoping this game gets enough love from both players and devs over time.\n\nAll said, it does feel like Dungeon Keeper 2.5...

My step dad originally introduced me, and I was immediately hooked. "It's good to be bad" was the game's slogan, and it held true to that. The third title was never released because bullfrog was aquired by every gamer's favorite company, EA. So when I heard EA was making a mobile dungeon keeper game a while back, I was interested, but extremely skeptical. Turned out to be freemium garbage as I expected. No dungeon keeper for like 15 years and you decide to bring it back as a cashgrab shell of its former self? Classic EA. There would never be another great DK game, or so I thought.\n\nThen I found out about WFTO. An independent group of people making a new DK game. Again, I had my heart crushed and stomped on before, so I was skeptical. When I first read reviews, it was from before the game's 1.1 patch, and they were rather mixed. Bugs, glitches, memory leaks, etc. I veered away at the time, but still checked up on it occasionally to see how the developers would respond. Over time, I started to notice that the developers were totally ontop of ♥♥♥♥. They were working hard to fix everything, and genuinely seemed to care about making a true successor to DK2. I became more interested and waited for it to go on sale.\n\nWhen I finally purchased it and played, I was hooked. I played till like 6 in the morning. This totally felt like what DK3 could have been if bullfrog were still around. They even got the original announcer! It was easy at first because of being a DK2 veteran, but eventually started to challenge me a bit more. I got my  handed to me a couple times on level 9 (Belmourne's pass) and had to start working out different strategies. I played nonstop and got to the final level in about two days, which I could not complete because of a glitch. This was pretty annoying, and I messaged the moderators on their subreddit (/r/WFTO). They were quick to respond and said it would be fixed. A couple days later, they released a patch that fixed everything I had trouble with, and I was able to complete the game in about 15 hours overall.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the series, you play as an unseen and omnipotent underlord. You manage your dungeon from a top down perspective and carve out rooms to attract minions to your lair. You use these minions to wipe out the humans (or other underlords) kind of like an RTS. I have to state though, that this is not a traditional RTS. You do not have to micro tons of units, instead you place a flag and all your minions will rally there. They use their own abilities too, so again don't let your bad micro skills stop you from buying this. You can set up defenses, fortifications, cast spells, rituals, and create constructs. There's a ton of different ways to succeed. Once you've eliminated the campaign objective or the human/cpu player's dungeon core, you win.\n\n\n\nPROS:\n- Original Announcer from the old DK games\n- Funny\n- More content than DK2\n- Countless ways to go about winning\n- Gameplay is unique from other RTS\n- Take control of a minion and join the battle in FPS mode\n- Satisfying to build things\n- Developers genuinely care about game\n- Multiplayer (Fight with or against your friends)\n- Campaign, skrimish, survival, sandbox, plus multiplayer. 5 Modes boys.\n- More content on the way\n- Challenging\n\nCONS:\n- Ending is awkward and unsatisfying at the moment (They will fix)\n- You may run into a glitch or two (Again, they will fix)\n- Little pricey\n- AI still needs a little work (AI won't build traps or defenses guarding their dungeon core, so you can just send all your units directly at it and 90% of the time you'll win. This is mainly a problem in multiplayer/skrimish.)\n\nOTHER:\n- You might have to mess with the graphic settings a bit to get it to run smoothly\n- To host a multiplayer game may require port forwarding\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you played the old DK games and liked them, I highly reccommend this. If you want a taste of the gameplay before you're sure, go get DK2 and play a few missions of that. While the campaign is great, I also reccommend getting a friend to buy it and trying out multiplayer.\n\n8/10.","June 20, 2015","true","25.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's only the score that it is because people started leaving reviews before the game was finished and before the 1.1 patch was released. This patch has been a complete revelation!\n\nI know what many of you are probably thinking as you trawl through the reviews left for War for the Overworld......"I thoroughly enjoyed the Dungeon Keeper games and I'd really hope that War for the Overworld would live up to my expectations, given that it's not exactly cheap". Well, as a long term Dungeon Keeper fan (I'm 28 now and played it daily when i was a teen, including a few play throughs as I've gotten older), I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.\n\nI actually felt quite sceptical when purchasing this game, simply because I enjoyed the original Dungeon Keepers games so much. I often hype up something in my own mind to the point where it will probably disappoint, but I've been very pleasantly surprised.\n\nThis is about as close as you can get to a Dungeon Keeper 3. I think the creators have done a really great job of keeping just enough of the old Dungeon Keeper vibes to satisfy the DK fans (for example the resemblance of many of the units in the game - The 'Workers' are clearly Imps, the 'Chunders' who love to work in the workshop and have the ability to 'fart' as a weapon (much like my girlfriend) are Bile Demons and you also get a female unit that loves to torture your enemies in the torture chamber.....remind you of anything (except without my old favourite spell lightning).\n\nYour creatures still need to eat but have moved away from chickens and now prefer micropiglets, and some of your old favourite spells are still available like being able to create more workers, being able to reveal parts of the map for limited time, and also the 'Call to Arms' spell has a 'Rally' option too.\n\nI think what's really great about War for the Overworld is the fact that the developers etc have taken great care to only change or remove elements from the DK games that actually work to improve this game. Does anyone remember in Dungeon Keeper how if you had enough gold, you could build an unlimited amount of traps and doors all over your dungeon, while you sat back and used the sight of evil spell in conjunction with the lightening or cave in spells to kill all of the enemy units? yeh you can'y do that anymore, you now actually have to think a bit more and strategy plays more of a part. Your mana pool is actually now split between the number of workers you have, the number of traps you have and any spells that you wish to cast. This means that you have to find a balance between those things because you have loads of workers, you wont be able to lay any traps or cast any spells, alternatively if you have loads of traps, you won't be able to create many extra workers or cast many spells. This was a welcome addition to the game because it's makes things more challenging, but not too difficult.\n\nThe graphics are nice and crisp, even if the frame rate can take an occasional hit on a very busy map (nothing that'd bothered me too much mind), the sound effects are very good and actually quite funny in terms of the things you hear your creatures randomly say, and there's more than enough content to keep you playing for a while with multiplayer, the campaign and a survival type mode.\n\nOverall I've been really, pleasantly surprised by this game and what I also think is great is that the developers are really looking after it when it comes to releases/patches/updates. They regularly make sure that they respond to requests from people in terms of improvements etc and they aren't just light touches either. When i first got the game, I felt a little sad that your workers aren't able to level up. After a few days they'd released another couple of updates which added the ability for workers to level and i noticed they'd fixed EVERY other minor bug that I'd experienced.\n\nYou get exactly what you'd want and would expect from this game and the aftercare provided by the regular updates etc. It's fun, challenging, addictive and you still get to feel very nostalgic if you loved the original Dungeon Keeper games. If you never played those games and are instead just contemplating buying this game - do it, you won't regret it.\n\nGraphics - 8/10 (for what it is, i think they're great)\n\nSound - 9.5/10\n\nGameplay 9/10 (With several game modes and the fact that each time you play you can change your style - you'll come back to this time anbd time again)\n\nOverall - 9/10","June 19, 2015","true","24.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game takes the premise of its spirtual ancestor, and expands it with new units, tools, and various other goodies.  Not all of this is for the best, however; many units and tools still feel underdeveloped and underbalanced.  Again, however, WftO now stands out as the best and the brightest of the DK-alikes out there (although, with Dungeons 2 as its only real competitor these days --with maybe KeeperRL as a very distant 3rd -- that's not saying much).\n\n+ Tried and tested Dungeon Keeper gameplay with its own spin.  That's the biggest plus right there.  After many patches, the dev team pretty much nailed what makes the DK formula special.  This single plus pretty much covers up for the game's myriad sins:\n\n- Campaign needs another pass.  One big quibble is the way that new units and tools are dumped willy-nilly on the player, with no warning or explanation, as the campaign progresses.  DK made sure that new stuff was properly introduced -- and necessary! -- at the end of each campaign mission.  WftO doesn't.\n\n- Poor use of all this new and different stuff in the campaign.  You get a lot of different toys and units, but you will not end up using some of them at all in the campaign.  (See: stone bridge).  This may be useful when playing multiplayer, but it's just clutter in the campaign.  Even read a book that cries out for better editing, for elimination of dross and a better focus on what is important?  WtfO needed a better editor, as it were.  There's just too much redundant stuff in it.  DK2 stripped away a lot of DK1's units and tools, as was the better game for it.\n\n- Much more MP focused than the DK games were.  WftO was evidently created by folks who thought DK's MP was the high point of the game, which is arguable.  As a result, you get less of a contemplative, polish your dungeon to a high sheen gameplay in favor of... zerg rushes and click-click-clicky around the map.\n\n- I was wondering if the devs were trolling me when I "won" the game.  Abrupt and unrewarding to say the least.  Not as bad, say, as an old NES game that just displayed "CONGRATULATIONS" on a black screen, but close.\n\n- I hate timed missions in a game centered on building stuff.  The campaign has a few.\n\nTL;DR: WtfO is close, but not quite, for those who waited patiently over the decades for a DK3.  It's definitely still worth a shot, though.\n\n\n\n","August 14, 2015","true","21.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In fact I would say that this is a pretty blatant copy of it, if the series hadn't been out of print for 16 years.\n\nThis is one of many series that Electronic Arts killed when they started buying up companies and then metaphorically salting the earth where the more quirky popular series once grew.  Bullfrog had Populous, Magic Carpet, Dungeon Keeper and Syndicate.  Origin had Ultima, Ultima Underworld and Wing Commander.  Heck, they even killed their own Mutant League Sports series when they became a "serious company".\n\nTL:DR - WftO is a lot like Dungeon Keeper 1&2, this is a good thing and thank God someone brought back the classic gameplay since EA sucks at pleasing fans of classic titles they own the rights to.","September 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

This is counter intuitive (atleast ot me)! the higher this value, the more you can zoom out.\n\nPROS:\nVery similar to Dungeon Keeper\nappox 10 hr campaign\nother game modes: skirmish, survivial, multiplayer\nNice economy feature: Each imp and trap reserves a small portion of your mana pool and caps at some percentage. This means you cant have a million imps and traps, instead only a dozen or two of each.\nSkirmish mode has about 10 maps ranging from 2 to 4 player and ranging in size by atleast a factor of four.\nNice feature which encourages non-open floor plans; room pieces (like a torture device in a torture chamber) get increased efficiency for each bit of wall within 1 square.\nSomewhat akin to Horned Reaper in DK2, there are three creatures which you can summon, but not control, which are at the apex of each skill tree. Unless you are rushing, I havent found them all too useful tbh.\nTraps have two modes, which are interchangable by only a mouse click. The modes differ per trap, but are often more complex than just a defense/offense mode.\nAdditional creature class called beasts, which are summoned by a room (not a portal).\n\nCONS:\nImps often poorly priorotize work, ie. reinforce walls (or do nothing) instead of claiming nearby tiles\nNo full page map\nCreatures are hard to distiguish from one another.\nCreature and room tooltips often do not appear when curser remains over them. I feel like the game is missing in game tooltops to better explain many creatures and rooms.\nStrange room/trap/spell/potion research tree which is confusing and annoying if you dont have all the room types built yet\nCampaign difficulty sways from trivial to really tough with few in a happy medium. Further balacing is needed.\nEven after 15+ hours im not totally sure what some of the more advanced rooms do. Certaintly they arent critical for success.\nNo Bile Demons, or farts.\nNot much (if anything) in the way of creature types which hate each other or fight. This differs from DK series where one might omit particular rooms to assure a happy dungeon.\nDoors are useless, and two traps in particular, cannon and well of souls, are OP.\nLeveled up imps do not have speed or teleport. But, there are new magic imps which work at a faster rate.\nEnemies dont die in prison and turn to skeletons, they stay in jail forever. Enemies which die in the torture chamber turn to stupid ghosts which vanish after a short time. They are best used by posessing and then kamazeeing through the other keepers dungeon - but largely useless.\nIn skirmish, AI often amasses a dungeon and army faster than humanly possible - which can lead to some frustratng early battles\n\nA few QOL improvement ideas:\n-There is a nice feature which you can group creatures into a warband and set a rally flag for just them. For example, warband 1 would be selected by clicking CTRL-1 then clicking the minions, and then sent to a rally by clicking 1 then then clicking on the map. I WISH that after clicking 1, before setting the rally point, all the minions in that warband would appear as distinct white dots on the mini map\n- You can select all creatures of a type into a warband by CTRL-1 then clicking thier creature type in the HUD rather than each individual one in the dungeon. I WISH I could toggle to automatically add all new creatures of that type which appear in my dungeon (or are converted in torture chamber) to that warband automatically.\n- I WISH I could toggle a rooms activity priority to surpass a rally point. For example, set my archive (library) to priority, so that if I use a Rally ALL point, a few inclined creatures would stay back and do research. This would be really nice for research, trap manufacturing and torturing at the very least.","November 5, 2015","true","16.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zetan4/recommended/230190/","zetan4","zetan4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zetan4/","31 products in account","First of all, this game does still have some bugs.  If buggy games bother you a lot, maybe give it another few weeks.  The devs are working hard, and they're making a ton of progress, but they're not quite there yet.\n\nThat said, this game is to Dungeon Keeper 2 what DK2 was to DK1.  If you feel (as I do) that DK2 was a drastic improvement over DK1, you're in for a hell of a ride with this game.\n\nSo many improvements to what, at it's core, is the same system.  Take traps/doors, for example.  In DK1, they would build whatever they wanted, then you could place it.  Kind-of annoying, since they would produce all the low-level stuff first, so if you wanted, say, a Steel Door, you'd have to wait.  Then, in DK2, you could place a door/trap, then they would get to work on it.  Definitely an improvement, since it didn't waste resources, but if you didn't currently have a place that you knew you wanted a door/trap, your workshop workers would just be slacking off.  In WFTO, they finally solved it.  Workshop workers build generic parts.  When you place doors/trap blueprints, your imps bring those parts to where they need to be, and after enough parts are brought, the door/trap exists.  It doesn't waste anything, and it's perfect.\n\nEverything in the game is like that.  They took a look at the systems in the DK games and said, "How can we make this better?"  They've done a remarkable job.  Researching rooms/spells is done through a sort of "skill tree" so you can spend your research points as you wish.  You can fill back in places you don't want dug out; one of my pet peeves with my DK dungeons is when they could be ruined by intruders, and now you can fix what they did.  There are all sorts of entirely new systems, like alchemy, constructs, and rituals, each of which have a different purpose and interesting uses.\n\nAll that, and I'd already be willing to pay more than the $30 MSRP.  But you know what else they decided to do?  Write a plot.  DK1 basically had none.  DK2 had a bit of one, but it was always, "Do the thing, this guy's trying to stop you from doing the thing.. yay, you did the thing!"  In this game, I'm only halfway through the campaign, and I'm already wondering what's going on and questioning the motives of certain characters.  Did you ever expect a DK-style game to have you questioning a character's motives?  I sure didn't!  It's a blast.\n\nSo yes, I'd recommend this game, even in its very-recently-launched state.  Like I said, if bugs bother you a lot, give it a bit more time, but if you're willing to forgive a bit (and if you played DK2, you should be; that game was never 100% stable) then you should just pick it up now.","April 8, 2015","true","12.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Overlord, Dungeons, Impire; they all had their charms but none were quite what I was hoping for and I REFUSE to buy Dungeon Keeper 2 from EA after they butchered the whole thing. I was really timid about going into this game because I had been disappointed so many times before but I have been greatly impressed by this game, it has filled the hole in my heart.\n\nIt's really easy to jump into if you've played other dungeon games, the skill trees are an interesting addition that makes multiplayer matches more dynamic. With the beast den, potions, constructs and rituals it feels like a genuine spiritual successor to those classics.\n\nThe one and only complaint I have is the lack of a dragon-like monster. When I was a kid I always loved to craft a dungeon and populate it with like 30 dragons. Huge scaly firebreathing besties make everything better! who knows though, might be added in future DLC or something. XD\n...maybe a skin for the Auger, that would work!

Honestly I hadn't even had it installed beyond the point of the first couple weeks.  Recently I have been pleasantly surprised. Not only has the game been given a campaign with a decent story but it did an excellent job leaving us off for further story (which I hope is on its way) Hours of great game play, good story, versatility and control over your dungeons population, a wide varriety of creatures, spells, defenses and rooms. lastly, a mode in which you can personally challenge yourself after you have beaten the story of the current game.\n\nCons\n- Whan your dungeon population starts getting a bit higher the game starts running a touch clunky (my pc specs are pretty decent)\n\n- Units will sometimes get stuck on the edges objects in a room.

You are often facing a ticking down timer, or faced with an AI opponent that has a fully built dungeon and starting minion compliment that happily bum rushes directly toward you within five minutes of the level loading with no reguard for its own level 1 minions.\n\nThis means that for most of the campaign you're distracted from building your dungeon by having to deal with a constant horde of weak pointless minions constantly trying to make a bee line to your dungeon heart.  On most maps, save for the one the game specifically expects you to create them on defenses generally feel pretty worthless as well, not like you'd even have time to build them on later missions anyway since the game just devolves into planting the All Minion/Beast flags down and spamming heal monster as fast as your mana can support.\n\nI also don't like how once the AI has decided it is going to attack you, there is basically nothing else to do except deal with its suicidal tendencies since it somehow always magically has a full host of minions to keep pouring into your territory, no matter how many you seem to kill/capture.  You can't drive them back and take a breather to let your minions sleep, eat, and get back to their tasks like performing rituals, converting prisoners and raising the collected corpses.  Your only choice is to keep an unrelenting drive directly to the dungeon heart even as more enemy minions run their little level 1 legs into your minion ball.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, Dungeon Keeper had a finite minion pool available on each map, and each portal would only allow a limited number of minions through.  When a minion died, it was gone for good and not available to either you, nor your enemies any longer.  This is what made portals matter, prisons, graveyards and torture chambers vital and scavenging pits so annoying.  It also ment you could slap the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of worthless creatures and kill them (or sacrifice them in the temple to make something better) so they wouldn't be constantly taking up a slot a better minion could be filling.  This also ment you could win a war of attrition as long as you killed more than you lost.\n\nStill, I don't hate the game.  I just get frustrated with the way it makes you play it.  I wish Steam would introduce stars instead of just a Yes/No.  My feelings on the game aren't that binary.  But I guess at the end of the day I'd still say it is worth a try, as long as you don't go expecting pure Dungeon Keeper out of it.","July 6, 2015","true","8.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

If you want to play a great "Dungeon Keeper" then you'll love this game. The humour is there, possession, torture chambers, workers -- everything you loved.\n\nThe campaign is pretty good. *Most* of the missions were fun, but some were either too easy, or boring. I don't think it reached the quality of the Bullfrog titles unfortunately.\n\nPet Dungeon seems pointless without the ability to spawn enemies.\n\nSkirmish and multiplayer are fun, thanks to the SIn ( level-up ) system, that gives you different ways to play and try out. Imagine a RPG tree system for your rooms and abilities.\n\nSome technical problems; nothing game breaking, or causing the game to crash, but you might see weird stuff happen occasionally.\n\nIf you want another Dungeon Keeper experience then buy it and enjoy.

On the later campaign maps my FPS drops to 16-30FPS depending on my zoom level, changing the graphical settings does nothing but even if it did it still wouldn't be excusable. I get a better frame rate on Witcher 3 with most of the settings cranked up to max for goodness sake.\n\nI'd absolutely love to recommend this game but if I'm having these sorts of issues with a system such as mine I dread to think how this game runs on less beefy systems because even my fully expanded Pet Dungeon is averaging out at 20 FPS.\n\nHere's a quick list of things that stuck to me after playing the whole campaign in one sitting:\n\nThe good news?\n- It's practically Dungeon Keeper 3, if you've played the previous games playing this will be like riding a bike.\n- Richard Ridings is as good as ever.\n- They absolutely nailed the sound design.\n\nThe so-so?\n- Greater degree of micromanagement:\n- I really don't like how doors function in this game, there's no 'only open for my minions mode'. You either keep it open or lock yourself in.\n- Prisons offer a greater variety of choices but it's always a manual process as to what you do with them. If the developer insists on these not automatically turning into undead like before there should at least be a means to auto-allocate them to the torture chamber, crypt or turn them into gold.\n- Imps and traps are tied to a limited mana pool, ultimately limiting the number you can have of either but this also means too many imps affects the number of traps you can create and vise versa. Not only that, imps don't seem to get any sort of speed increase as they level up.\n\nThe uh-oh?\n- Aforementioned performance issues.\n- Campaign is seriously lacking variety. Albeit, there are some call-backs to the sort of thing you'd see in DK1&2 but there isn't much of a sense of exploration and it's sorely lacking in surprises. You won't be running into ball traps or neutral rooms in this game. The maps also often feel a little cramped in regards to how much space they're offering you to build rooms of an acceptable size of quantity.\n- Unit balance seems all over the place and level 10 units feel weak. Battles seem to be about whoever has the most amount of units regardless of level.\n- And then there's some somewhat niggling issues like your minions getting upset and leaving a fight (or ignoring NPCs altogether) because they want to get fed or paid. I was warned that my minions were starting to revolt on the final level simply because there was such a prolonged period of fighting before you were granted the opportunity to send your minions back home.\n\nI really like this game and want to see it become the DK3 everyone wanted but it still needs some serious work. I certainly don't regret my purchase but these shortcoming need to be noted. If you really want your Dungeon Keeper fix but already played DK1 and 2 to death you still might get some enjoyment out of this. The core is all there, it's all the ragged edges that need smoothing out.","December 24, 2015","false","39.7"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","0"

It is incredibly similar to Dungeon Keeper (so much so that I keep struggling to call it otherwise in my Let's Play for it!).\n\nNow, when I first re-opened the game, I was again annoyed that everything seemed a bit bland and grim around the edges in colour. A strange criticism for a game surrounding evil overlords, but one worth adding. I did however have a personal fix for this. One that I haven't had to utilize in years, outside of a horror game. I adjusted the gamma ... though I did so by a whooping 60% brighter.\n\nI can now see the detail the devs have put into some of the blocks, the rooms, the gold veins, the walls and more. It's a very, very beautiful sight to see and one that brings back many memories to the old DK games that WFTO was inspired by. It just seems such a shame that the darkness level is so off that I needed to adjust it by that amount to see the gorgeous detail (something I haven't had to do on any other game in my library or console, since Resident Evil 5 on the 360!).\n\nWould I recommend WFTO to an RTS friend or a friend new to gaming?\n\nAs of this re-review, yes I would.\n\nSummary of Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n\nArt team have worked incredibly hard on their designs, with only a few feeling "rushed" or in need of improvement. To perfect this, I'd recommend a DLC release of additional textured skins for monsters. Allowing players to see their succubi with the more traditional tail, wings and hoofs demon look, or the Cultist with an entirely different robe/without hood (take DK2's hero creatures and do one better, especially if you're charging for it!)\n\nSpells very potent and powerful, though mana caps left me feeling like a kid waiting for their pocket money (even with a limited amount of workers and traps!), as mana slowly trickled up again. It's a tough balancing act I suppose, though I'd rather cast more harmful spells with less damage, than a more potent one, waiting for the resources to do so. Dungeon Keeper 1's charging spells did a very good job of that, giving you additional options to take on your foes.\n\nThe sound effect team have done an amazing job, leaving me without anything but praise in that department. Music wise, we could use something a bit more noticeable from time to time, with the most notable bit of ambience that comes to mind, being the beating of your dungeon core. Maybe have a track that brings more epic to large scale combat?\n\nTraps are simple, but effective and the rate at which they're constructed is lovely. Constructs are a beautiful addition that allow for a great deal of variety when planning both your attacks and defences and bring in a truly unique mechanic to the familiar game play style we have come to love.\n\nThis now feels like a suitable replacement for the game-play style of the Dungeon Keeper games, though it has also put itself on the map with unique mechanics only found within WFTO.\n\nThe animations that are in the game look very nice and flow very well! This is a bitter sweet bit of praise that I'll elaborate on in the cons section...\n\nCons:\n\nCertain lines of dialogue appear time and time again and just aren't bold enough in their dark humour to be as funny as the standard we've seen before. The Cultist is constantly testing my patience and leaving me to consider home schooling my workers, simply so that I can hurl the cultists into the torture chamber, due to lacking a suitable means of gagging them. The narrator is especially bad for this, with introductions nattering on for far too long, quips being far too frequent and notifications severely needing a "Toggle Vocal Notifications Off" option.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate him telling me that a Gnarling has entered my dungeon, but at times it almost sounds as if he's telling me "A Gnarling has picked his nose and flicked the snot. Just thought you should know." some things need a verbal notification, whilst others could do nicely with a quick icon to let you know.\n\nAnimations! Where art thou? I want to see the creatures roaming idle around my dungeon, DRINKING in the tavern or playing darts! I want to see the creatures walking about exploring the halls, or performing a unique idle animation to give more character! You have amazing animators on your team, so I cannot stress how much this would add to breathe life into your key actors, the monsters themselves! Picking up minions, dropping them and by ALL THAT IS EVIL, give them a unique and satisfying reaction (for us ;) ) to being slapped!\n\nThe right click is not being utilized as well as it could, and it would be nice to see a grand overview of the mini map, akin to DK's right click to enlarge and snap to location. Breaking out of possession should be a right click motion. You need to be given the ability to maim your enemy as quickly as possible through the eyes of your beast, so again, "Attack" should be your default ability upon possessing a monster.\n\nPlaceholders. Ladies and Gentlemen, you know this is absolutely unacceptable for a fully released game, though I have no doubt at all that this will be updated in time.\n\nI now consider WFTO a fun game to play, that has delivered quality for the money I originally paid way back when. If you are sitting on the fence about buying this, I would say go for it. You will find a fun game full of love, though one that is currently in a late state of Early Access.\n\nOld negative review below:\n\nThe contents below are from my previous experiences with WFTO which was originally a "Not Recommended" critique. I still have a critique to give, but I would recommend this game to a friend in its current state, even with a very cheeky release from Early Access.\n\nPrior to editing this 153/266 people (58%) agreed with the contents below, for an October 2014 Early Access review.\n\n"This review is written as a review from an early access point of view.\n\nThis game will attract people in pursuit of a way to sake their Dungeon Keeper cravings, but unfortunately the execution of War for the Overworld just seems very off to me and I'll try to explain why.\n\nThe art style carries something that isn't all that unique considering its inspiration here, though inside the game it sadly follows the horrible dark pallet of muddy browns and snot greens. The original Bullfrog games carried a lovely sense of character behind their cartoony characters with a mix of gritty in there, though the monsters featured in War for the Overworld (Monsters being the most critical desired feature for this kind of game), all lack a true sense of personality and shine, with none of them really standing out and saying "Hey look at me! I'm a really epic looking creature! I'm the funny creature that hits like a tank!", it just feels lacking here.\n\nI bought the game very early on and have logged on progressively overtime to inspect the updates. After what seems like a year now, the updates have been far too slow and lacking in real momentum, especially considering the price tag and how early this early access game arrived.\n\nThis game carries a positive review score currently, though from what I've seen of them, quite a few of these reviews are posted with the hope and praise that this game is the next Dungeon Keeper.\n\nSadly, at the time of writing this, I believe this game is not a viable replacement for your evil sandbox and doesn't seem like it will be any time soon."","October 27, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

I took sometime to complete this level with at least five attempts being racked up.\n\nThe final level was very easy. In fact too easy. The only reason I took more than three attempts to complete it was due to a bug that stopped me. This bug persisted through game save and load and system restart forcing me to start the level over on two occasions.\n\nThe ending was disappointing. Leaving me, and others, to think the end cut scene was glitched. (I no longer believe this is the case).\n\nBad:\nLoading times are long, especially when launching the game I often had "Program not responding" dialogs pop up. After clicking wait for program to respond the game would start.\n\nLag, Lag and more Lag! The game lags a lot. Especially when big battles are happening.\n\nStill buggy in parts. Even though the game is now considered a "Release" product.\n\nAI can be very stupid. Good for us trying to beat it. No so good for over all game enjoyment.\n\nSometimes mid battle you are healing or zapping trying to protect your core and.... ARRRRR.... A cut scene as a new minion enters your dungeon with no way to skip the bloody thing.\n\n\nGood:\nAs a fan of the Dungeon Keeper games and having spent many, many hours playing them this game does not disappoint and keeps to the spirit of the DK sieris.\n\nDespite all of the "Bad" above the game is still well worth buying as I am sure with refinement via patches this will fix most of the issues.\n\nBottom line:\nI would recommend this game if you are a fan of the DK games or if you are new.\nI score this game 7/10. (This is because I am a fan of the DK games and can over look the issues I had).\n\nI hope the issues are patched and if/when they are the game will be much better.","June 28, 2015","true","39.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Oberon help me, let's do this.\n\nWFTO is a labour of love, a game that was born from passion rather than a desire for money.It is the kind of experience that might be less polished than other games (the game could use a ton of bugfixes), but every inch of the game has been crafted with passion, and you've got to respect that. But there's a lot to say about this spiritual sequel to Dungeon Keeper.\n\nGraphically, the game is superb, and more importantly, it's memorable ! From the colorful rooms, to the dark creatures, down to the little details like the awesome logo (can't keep my eyes off that logo, it's pretty !) or the achievement icons, this games looks great. Kudos to the art team.\n\nMusically there isn't much to discuss, the music is very discrete, but the sound design and narrator voice more than make up for that silence. Too bad after 20 hours all I wanted was for him to shut up, because he never stops talking.\n\nCampaign is solid, a good tutorial that suffers from some ridiculous difficulty spikes at times. I rage quit some missions multiple times because some rival underlord's actions are very random and they won't behave the same way every time.\n\nIn the end, this game could potentially become a worthy successor to DK/DK2, but it still needs some fine tuning and polishing. In terms of content, there's more than enough to keep you busy for months, but I don't really feel compelled to return now that i have finished the campaign (which is still something only 10% of the playerbase has done, so hurray !).\n\nWait for the developers to iron out most problems, wait for it to go on sale, and grab yourself a copy of War for the Overworld.","January 11","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

DK fanboy. 7/10 if they fix the stuttering.\n\nIt really does feel like you're playing Dungeon Keeper. It has a somewhat more serious tone than the originals, whether or not that's a good thing will be personal preference.They're apparently already working on patch 1.4. There are few issues  as far as I can see that would negatively affect the gameplay - the only one really that got under my skin was the stuttering on the larger maps. Decent graphics & music creates a nice atmosphere. The game is more fast paced than DK2 - I'd recommend setting the game speed to about 60-70%\n\nMy single player experience : The first half has a distinct DK1 feel to it, while later on with the bigger maps it plays more like DK2.  The campaign was a little short for my liking but I would happily buy an expansion to extend that playtime. Some levels are pretty challenging while others are too easy.\n\nMinions : A lot of people didn't like that you had so many "human" minions in DK2 and I feel they have a nice balance here. When you upgrade your beast lair and build a fighting pit, you get 4 different types plus beastmasters who whip them all the way to the pit so they fight each other for xp, the beastmaster also gets xp from this. You have 2 rally flags, one for beasts and one for all your minions so you can use your beasts to ward of small groups without interrupting your minions. Beasts don't collect wages, just the beast master.\n\nUndead : Personally I like the way they handled it. Vampires are created by making 3 sacrifices and having a ritual charged. They eat live prisoners. Corpses from the battlefield, torture chamber & prison (after a vampire feeds or they they lie there too long because the prison is full) are taken to the crypt where your necromancers raise them as ghouls (skeletons) who then permanently follow the necro that raised them. Prisoners eat the rats and will not die in your prison.\n\nPotions : A new feature where at the cost of some gold you create potions to be used similar to spells. Build an alchemy lab to attract crackpots who will brew them for you.\n\nAnother absolutely great new feature is the ability to create dirt blocks. In DK2 I'd often lose an hour of play because some dwarf decided to tunnel into my dungeon and I would restart the level. How I wish this was a feature in DK2.","January 3","true","84.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has some flaws and is badly optimized, which can result in bad performance even on newer system configurations. The campaign is a good introduction into the game mechanics and often missions can be done in many different ways. The missions later on in the game will often appear undoable at first but once you understand what mechanic or concept the devs tried to teach in that mission/lesson, it will become a lot easier (good work on that). The campaign is a little short however and the story is generic at best. Great voice acting on the advisor which in my opinion is often a little too serious.\nYou can tell that the devs have tried to trim the game for competitive multiplayer, which is why the game feels a lot more hectic and microintensive than DK. Unfortunately it is hard to find a multiplayer match, due to the lack of players.","December 30, 2015","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean I understand what it's trying to communicate, but it's just so inadequate.\n\nThat being said, I loved Dungeon Keeper and this is more of the same. There seemed to be a little more in the way of help in Dungeon Keeper but once you ease in to WFTO you'll find nuance that never existed in the old catalogue. I will forever miss the comedic cut scenes between levels in the campaign of DK II but we can't have it all, can we?\n\nI do find umbrage in the way AI is handled. Specifically, I find it a little unbalanced that the computer players can produce the enitre contents of their dungeon in under a second while I have to slowly rally my troops or click them, ten at a time, to the desired location. This is especially frustrating in later levels of the campaign or when playing master difficulty in Skirmish mode.\n\nMy glee returns however with the addition of new spells. Some of which feel spectacularly more sadistic, such as turning enemy captives into gold statues. I do like the new shrines and I am honestly one of those folks that wanted to see the ability to add walls.\n\nI don't see myself wasting as much time with this one as I did with DK, but is that because I already played DK? Is it because the content isn't there quite yet? This remains to be seen, but for now, A Solid Buy.","December 25, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

WFTO is an enjoyable game, with great audio and visual's, and is a worthy spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper. With caveats.\n\nDK2 remains one of my favourite games, but WFTO can't quite match it. With DK2, I am content to spend a very long time building a dungeon, training my forces and then annihilating my foes. WFTO on the other hand wants you to speedrun the levels as fast as possible. Combine that with some really poor performance problems, I ended up shelving the game for a very long time, only picking it up again recently to finish it off. (Also, as a sideeffect of being forced to "rush" levels, the game feels bloody short).\n\nAs a Kickstarter backer, one of the perks I received was a custom dungeon skin - I have never even seen this as it doesn't apply for the main campain. Assumably then it applies to multiplayer (which I'm unlikely to play) or sandbox, which I'm likely to try once or twice. Plus, the game offers bonus skins for unlocking speedrun achivements. Not that I have done these, but again I don't see the point of custom skins if you can only use them in limited places.\n\nThat's all my opinion, so may be different for you. I hope the expansion is a little more laid back though.","January 19","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's more complicated than Dungeon II which I also really like.  I do feel that the tutorial in Dungeon II campaign is better though because it explains each little item as you go.  War for the Overworld does not do this.  For instance on Level 7 you really need to build the bombard traps and lots of them but the game does not teach you that you need foundries to get toolboxes to build defenses.  I had a lot of defenses but none of them were building so I had to watch a video online and not only did it show me that you need foundries but that you can pick up toolboxes and put them directly on the defenses to speed up their building.  The game also did not teach me how to use the screen that lists all your monsters and click on it to pick up guys.  I learned that from watching a youtube video.  On level 7 I found the lack of gold to be my biggest obstacle but using blood money and a big prison and turning all their guys into gold statues did the trick.  Infinite gold basically.  Actually it might be level 9 where you have the gold problems looking at my notes.\n\nOne problem I have with the game is that moving around on the screen does not work well with the mouse.  In Dungeons II the mouse moves around on the screen really well but in War for the Overworld you really need to use the arrow keys instead.  It works really well with the arrow keys.  Another problem is the game is a bit dark and so it's harder to see the screen.  I understand underground is supposed to be dark but I would really appreciate a little more light for visibility.  Overall the game does a really good job in that you have many minion choices from Succubus to Vampire , etc.\n\nI guess I should be writing this review from the perspective of advertising to someone who has never played a game like this before.  In that case you build a dungeon to defeat the do gooders that come to destroy your dungeon.  You do this by carving out rooms in the underground and then putting things in them like vaults to store gold, Barracks to attract    low level monsters, Prisons to put enemies in, torture chambers for Succubi to convert them to your side or turn them into Ghosts, Beast chambers to attract beasts, etc.  Then you build an army out of these creatures to attack your enemies.  You can also use traps and doors to slow down the enemy or kill them.  All in all this is a very good game.","July 17, 2015","true","40.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I replayed the game a few times as it was updated to get a feel for how it was progressing, and I must say I am quite impressed with the state the game is in now compared with just 6 months ago. The game is well balanced and the progression is smooth from start to finish on the campaign (and in a skirmish). It's not just feature complete but feature rich.... way more content than ANY Dungeon Keeper game ever made. And from what I understand they have plans to add even more content soon with no signs of stopping! It's almost kind of ridiculous how much work has been put into this game. The personality of the original Dungeon Keeper games is intact and further refined. This game makes me laugh out loud regularly! If you were a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper games, this game could become an obsession for you.

Look no forward! After few not really worth ideal successors here is a game that takes exactly where the gone Bullfrog left and improves it adding many more features and diversifying your arsenal. I'm just at the beginning of the game but I had to stop because tears of nostalgia were blinding me.\nI've finished the first few missions that introduce you to the game: you are a dungeon lord that explores a subterranean world and attracts minions and terrible creatures to work in his dungeon to search for new powerful spells or build traps and doors to protect your dungeon from rival keepers or from those awfully pretend-to-be-heroes that wants to stop you from recovering your realm.\nDidn't try multiplayer yet and many other features that are available other than the single campaign, but I love more the solo options, so my review even when updated in future, will reflect this.\nAt the moment I can say I am really impressed by this game I followed through updates from the beginning of the early access and I was really waiting to install it (bought long time ago and never played as my library is quite full...).\nTo all Dungeon Keepers fan: do not hesitate!

Lots of new rooms, abilities, spells, creatures - everything.\n\nThere's still some slight bugginess (as of 12/16/2015) - mainly just some minor issues with the GUI (IE: if you slap a minion too fast, it will only show the animation for the first slap)\n\nCampaign is a lot of fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoreUnique22/recommended/230190/","MoreUnique22","Stimwalt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MoreUnique22/","161 products in account","Overall Rating = 8.5/10\n\nThis game will remind you of Dungeon Keeper almost immediately, and does a good job of keeping things fun and interesting, but it does need more content and polishing.  However, it is still worth the purchase right now, and I'm convinced the development team is dedicated to improving the gameplay and world, especially after reading their state of the game updates.  Give these guys a chance, they really "get it" and aim to please all dungeon keepers out there.  I mean... underlords! :)\n\nWhat really needs improvement?\n\n-Large scale battles on large maps like the Campaign map "The Kenos" are still choppy.  The game seems to be very RAM intensive on larger maps, so efforts to correct this are very highly recommended.  I have a very high end machine with 32GB of 1600 DDR3 RAM, i7 Quad Core 3.6GHz, and 2x GeForce 780ti's in SLI, and it was choppy for me.  Most likely this has to do with how the game handles memory/processor usage.\n-Possession combat is wonky currently.  It's hard to really control the attacks, and you can barely tell if you used one of the creatures abilities or not.  The animations are not prominent when you attack during possession.\n-Need more reason to possess a creature, as currently it doesn't seem to make any difference in combat whether you possess a creature or not?\n-Not sure if heros or evil heros are implemented or not, but that would be a no-brainer for possession mechanics, assuming it will be in the game at all.\n-When building structures like pig slaughter, lair, barracks, etc.. it would be nice if there were visual queues that helped the player visually understand how much bigger their barracks needs to be to increase the army size.  If i build a 3x3, and I have a 10x10 slaughter/lair, maybe when the user mouses over the barracks, it shows them what they are missing by just having a 3x3 barracks?  You get the idea, even if maybe I used the wrong structures in my example!\n\nWhat would be nice to have?\n\n-I think the game needs a more elaborate sound track/sound effects, as while there is music, it's not dark and dungeony enough for my taste.  I like the current feel of the game, goofy and dark, just continue that theme with more dramatic music during attacks from dwarves, or the discovery of artifacts.  While it's cool to hear the guy say "You have discovered an artifact" maybe a prominent noise specific to artifact discover would be nice, because you tend to tune that voice out after awhile.\n-I'm not sure if there is a hotkey system, but if there is, make it more obvious via the tutorial.  I'd rather bind things to my own hotkeys menu, especially the rally flags for minions and beasts, and reveal fog of war ability, lightning ability, etc.\n-Add more randomness to digging blocks of earth.  Maybe occassionally I discover a trapped worker from a previous underlord, or a passageway to another area filled with secrets (that appeared as ROCK via reveal fog of war), or stout dwarven enemies, or neutral merchants that sell potions, whatever.  Fog of war should not be able to tell you everything you need to know before digging - add that element of surprise, as it makes the overall game mechanics of digging itself far more interesting.\n-Tooltips could use improvement, as when I first started placing blade lotus and defenses, it was not immediately clear to me via the game's user interface, or mouse over tips, that I needed a Foundry to provide the defensive parts to my structures.  It would be nice to recommend building a Foundry, similar to the suggestion above about adding more visual queues to gameplay/building for ease.\n\nThe Final Verdict?\n\nOverall Rating = 8.5/10\n\n-This game will be great eventually, and right now it is still very good.  If you want to wait for a more polished game in a few months, you can because the development team is determined, but this game is already very playable in most cases, and is a lot of fun as is.","August 15, 2015","true","27.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And here, War For The Overworld falls a little short.\n\nSpecifically, short in the following areas:\n\n* Richard Ridings' voice makes a welcome return, but his scripts seem to lack the originality and humour of his earlier narrations.\n\n* Similarly the environments, rooms and characters, while well-polished and detailed, are a little lacking in character and are for the most part forgettable. Voices other than those of Ridings' are... a little cringeworthy.\n\n* AI attacks (campaign) feel very much scripted.  I know that they always will be, but the problem is how much they FEEL so. It affects suspension of disbelief, and I get the impression that most of the time my Dungeon creation is periphary compared to how much I can electrocute enemies, heal minions and drop minions at critical locations.\n\n* Some poor optimisation (game at times becomes very stuttery when busy, even on high-end hardware) and bugs (stuck in walls when posessing a minion - clipping bug?).\n\n* The music is largely forgettable, in comparison to Dungeon Keeper 2's, which had wonderfully atmospheric gregorian chants.  I think the music's contribution in DK2 is mistakenly underestimated, and once again is a very tough act to follow.\n\nI don't want to beat up on this game though, and I've had some fun playing it.  Given the amount of commitment the devs have shown, I hope they'll continue to improve things.  I look forward to having another play some time in the future.","January 15","true","8.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The minions have a lot of character, although some are sorely missed (I'm looking at you Mistress and Horny), the updated gameplay and smooth controls more than makes up for it.\n\nFor anyone considering this game, if you have a sense of humor, and enjoy any combination of stragegy, god-sim, or slapping imps, this game is definitely for you.\n\nA+","May 27","true","47.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are a few bugs to be worked out... and I believe the game probably should have stayed in Beta for a few months longer to work them out. It's small things really, information about units/tiles which isn't fully there, no capability for more than 2+ opponents in multiplayer/skirmish and the odd random crash due to things I'm not even sure of. These however are being worked on by the Dev's from what I can read.\n\nBut the game itself is still pretty good regardless of all that I've mentioned. A plethora of minions, the voice over/game tutor with attitude, the spells and good use of the Unity engine presents the game in a very graphically pleasing way. It's a very worthy spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper that's for sure... and if like myself you still have a bad taste in your mouth from EA's attempt to milk money from the name, this should help wash it away.\n\nI'd be lying though if I would call this a "complete game". As I said earlier, it probably could've done with staying in Beta a little while longer and I have a feeling you'll feel the same if you buy this game now. That being said I would still recommend it, it is very deserving of your money, but be prepared to ignore a few incomplete aspects of the game.","April 12, 2015","true","4.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game is stonking amazing...it literally is the third coming of Dungeon Keeper.\n\nI've been a backer, but I honestly only played occasionally, feeling that it would be best to play when the game was pretty much feature complete and also since I don't have much time to bugtest it made the best sense for me.  I am absolutely THRILLED at what they've done here...what they have managed to accomplish.\n\nI have played up until the 5th mission in campaign as well as some putzing around in the other modes for several hours (30+), and I can truly say that this has been the time of my life.  The heart and soul of DK is there.  Yes, sure, there's a few bugs and glitches, but this is a massive undertaking that they've done here and the end result is quite simply astonishing.  It looks brilliant, and the humor is there.\n\nI experienced zero crashes and very few bugs on my playthrough today.  I played about 4 hours straight and had an absolute blast.\n\nI've enjoyed checking out every room and looking at the tiniest details in each of their design.  Posession is quite fun and reveals the amount of work put into each of the models and objects.  It's exquisite.\n\nI have absolutely no doubt that given a month or so, a ton of the early bugs will be squashed. This developer team is hardcore committed to making this project a success and you can see it everywhere.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original DK, or are looking for a game where it's good to be bad, please check this out.  It is quite simply a load of fun with an immense level of detail that puts other games to shame.  This is truly an incredible job they've done and they deserve a swift pat on the back for what they've accomplished.\n\nBuy it!","April 8, 2015","true","50.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

If I  sound harsh, I'm sorry.  I just want to be honest.\n\nIn the current form of this game, as of 2:49 AM on April 9th, 2015 I can't recommend it for purchase.\n\nLet me start out by saying something very positive- this game has great potential.\n\nAnd I do like the graphics, for the most part, and I've had no major issues with the A.I. on both sides...\n\nOkay,\nNow my biggest complaint is that the game is simply not finished.  I thought and believed I was purchasing a product ready for use but that is not the case. For instance, playing through the campaign I found numerous placeholders where names of characters should have been marked. I know that might be insignificant in the whole scheme of the game but details matter and this game is just not there where a product should be when brought to the marketplace.  It is not polished, it is not complete, and it is not worth a purchase at this current time.\n\nThe campaign felt untested, like I’m a paying beta player and they still expect feedback on the balance of gameplay.  But I’m not a paying beta tester, I’m a disappointed consumer who feels bamboozled.\n\nThe game is buggy as all get out (and I've heard they have been working on the situation...and I can forgive a few bugs...but not when the games crashes or freezes over and over.) I must applauded how quick the developers have responded with patches.  This act has given me hope.\n\nThe loading screen, which takes forever, reminds me of games dating back to the earlier 2000’s, and not in a good way. Actually, this game feels like an early 2000 release but it isn’t…which makes me sad…because at least then I could have given it a pass for being out dated.  But, that is not the case.\n\nI have read this game is trying to emulate Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2, a game I have not played, so I can’t speak from that point of view. However, as a newcomer to this genre I have felt the uneasy tension that this game doesn’t have a personality of its own. It feels bland, a dime store novel filled with stock everything.  I have not had one single WOW moment during gameplay that inspires me to continue playing or advocating my friends to purchase this game.  It just feels generic.  I loved the idea presented in this game but the execution is lacking.\n\nA few functions of the game I found odd, wait, no, I actually found missing, are common place in many other strategy games I’ve played.  For instance, I have yet to find any indication of a pause button, a min/max speed button, or a restart option on the menu.  Frankly, a restart option would be fantastic because of how many times I’ve had a campaign with unclear directions and a steady stream of escalating forces pushing down on me from the start, killing me off quickly and forcing me through the torturous load screen once more because apparently I’m a glutton for punishment.  Ugh, it’s just bonkers to me that these three options are not presented in the structure of the game.  I digress, for maybe I’m a foolish gamer who has become spoiled on what I thought were considered common place functions built into modern games.\n\nSomething must be said about the lost art of creating your dungeon, alas, maybe I assumed too much about the game actually allowing you to create a dungeon to fit your deepest and darkest desires.  More often than not, it comes down to pure function overriding any hope of creating  something to satisfy that hunger of building a dungeon worth calling a dungeon.  I feel the fast, pushy pace of the game doesn’t help, but again, there is no pause button to allow you to form a creation you can be proud of to counter the speed at which the game opperates.\n\nI am also amazed at how fast you can bring down walls.  The sensation of seeing the walls crumble in mere seconds pulls me straight out of the game because I don’t experience the satisfaction of ripping the earth out bit by bit in my endeavor to create something worthy of occupying the space.  To be clear, I’m not saying it should take an hour per wall, but I do feel that the balance is not correct when it comes to the speed of clearing a cavern for your lair and monsters.  I don’t feel like I’m accomplishing anything due to the speed at which this process occurs, especially when I wish to make hallways to connect my rooms and an enemy can come through and burrow through said wall with remarkable ease and speed. I think the economy of the overall game structure doesn’t feel balanced to how I hoped or expected it would be. Did the developers plan on games/matches to occur and finish under ten minutes? If so, then I have chosen poorly with my purchase.\n\nAnd last, but not least, the mini-map. Really, it feels like it was created in Microsoft paint? It's dreadfully painful to use and basically takes up space in it's current form. Again, if this was a game made in 2001 than I wouldn't be as upset to the design of the mini-map, but it's 2015.\n\nI've read this a small develpement team funded by kick starter and that's all awesome, truly,  however, I don't think that should excuse them from releasing a game in this current form. I get giving them slack where you might not with a larger studio, but at some point that slack runs out and they run the risk of accidently hanging themself...and letting the game die...and I hope that doesn't happen.\n\nLet me end by saying something positive- this game has great potential and I hope that somehow it becomes nurtured and turns into what it could be, a great, fun, challenging game…but until it happens, stay away.\n","April 9, 2015","false","23.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Left it here as it seems to be the right thing to do.\n\nBrilliant game, highly recommened if you love Dungeon Keeper, but just as a caution its still in alpha/beta phase so only buy if your willing to cope with bugs and some missing features.  However the game at the moment does have a few sandbox maps to play on, which is always a good thing.\n\nThe game is also being constantly updated, and from what I can see they could make this a final release if they wanted, and the developers also coinstantly update their fans every Wednesday.\nFinal Release reviewBelow you'll find the review of the final version of the game.\n\nPros+ Plays a lot like Dungeon keeper 2\n+ Runs fairly well on lower end hardware\n+ Brilliant voice acting\n+ Visuals are pretty good\n+ Not published by EA\n+ No Asset flipping\n\nCons- Still a few minor bugs and glitches here and there\n- Long loading times (This may be my system though)\n- A few frame rate issues here and there.\n\nOverallThis is the Dungeon Keeper we wanted.  Something that EA could never provide.  While the game does indeed have its issues and some frame rate problems, it is highly recommended and with the sales coming up soon you might even be able to pick this up really cheap.\n\nAt its core its Dungeon Keeper, with a lot more.  After playing a few missions in the campaign I found the game is a lot faster paced than Dungeon Keeper 2, but it isn't bad in fact its quite exciting.","November 24, 2013","true","10.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In it's current form, it seems quite playable besides the odd bug (I found on the last map, minions couldn't find food or their bed if my dungeon became too large, even despite my attempts to keep the layout simple.)\n\nIn general, I have to say I'm disappointed. Being named "War for the Overworld," I expected it to actually follow on from the DK2 storyline and actually be a war for the overworld. However, the campaign just seems like a stale revamp of the original. There's any number of directions it could have been taken in and I was expecting new and exciting content, a new world, new storyline and new characters. The game just seems like DK2 with a new skin though, and little tweaks that just come across as a either a lack of imagination or, more likely, a lazy attempt to avoid copyright violations. If the developers were trying to honor their predecesor, that's one thing, but there just seems to be very little original content added on to what has been copied.\n\nI found the start of the campaign a bit tedious, given that the 'tutorial' is built into it, and I'm sure other old players remember enough of how to play to just want to get straight to the meat of it. Unfortunately there wasn't really any meat at all. The levels were very much in line with those from the previous game and the ending felt very anticlimactic and disappointing. There were no quirky cinematics and even the humour, which the previous game was iconic for, falls short of the mark.\n\nI'm not as much of a fan of PvP as I was in Dk2, and I'm sure if you are, you'll get more out of this game than I did. For those who prefer single player though, don't get your hopes up. The game just doesn't have any replay value as far as I'm concerned. When I finished DK2, I felt like playing the campaign again straight after. With WftO I finished the campaign and just felt like kicking the game into the corner and never looking at it again.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk about adding new content to the game, but I haven't seen much at all. There are some new maps to play on but most seem to be coming from the the playerbase and are of course completely disconnected from the storyline. The updates are mainly bug fixes with the odd new (and boring) spell thrown in, and of course character skins (which you have to pay extra for.) The updates are also very slow for what they are.\n\nThe one good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are pretty decent. But given the time between now and when DK2 was released, you'd expect better graphics anyway. However, if you were to offer me this game as it is, or DK2 with updated graphics, I'd rather pay for the latter. No competition.\n\nThere's just far too much lacking from this game for it to be labelled a "spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper" (according to Wikipedia.) I can appreciate if the developers have a lack of experience in game development or lacked imagination in making this game as a tribute. But what really irritates me is that they seem to be more focused on peddling merchandise than giving players a decent gaming experience. They took a scrapped gaming idea from another company, failed to fulfill its potential, instead opted to copy its predecessor and even failed to do that, and then took months to release patches to make the game playable because they were probably too busy focusing on their merchandise. It's pure money making by playing off the success of a far better game, that they had absolutely nothing to do with.\n\nTLDR;\nThis is Dungeon Keeper 2 with better graphics but lacking in [dungeon] heart. If you haven't played DK2, buy it instead. If you have, buy something else that supports developers with more imagination (usually at a lower price too). And if you bought or are planning to buy one of the character statuettes on the WftO store, you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourself "What the hell is wrong with me?"","January 22","false","24.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I wanted to love this game, I was very enthused about it, I initially gave it positive reviews and decided to wait and give it a chance to be patched.\n\nBut now several months in the game lacks a Pet Dungeon mode and the Sandbox Mode is a poor substitute because it has no missions, no objectives, and no real sense of progression. It didn't even have a hero gate on the maps I checked. It seems like a step in the right direction but if nothing more is ever made of it, it's an inadequate half step.\n\nThe Campaign initially struck me as promising until I noticed that it's full of pre-fab rooms and rushes you to finish and basically punishes the player for trying to  lovingly hand carve a dungeon.\n\nAside from that it's not bad, but months after launch I had hoped it would be more of a spiritual successor than it actually is. Dungeons 2 is actually a closer spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper 2 than War for the Overworld is, and it has multiple factions to play as, so if it comes down to a choice between War for the Overworld and Dungeons 2 for DK2 fans I'd suggest buying Dungeons 2 instead.\n\nI'll change my recommendation later if they add a Pet Dungeon equivilent and revise the Campaign maps to be more about crafting a dungeon and less about capturing rooms and rushing, but for now, I give it a thumbs down on the grounds that this isn't as much like Dungeon Keeper 2 as it appears on the surface. Once you dig past the surface, it's a very different game, and a bit of a letdown.","January 24","false","10.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Yes, you are reading it right - the cursor. They made it look like a finger from an original game, unfortunately as far as using it in the game it somehow became harder, probably due to increased resolution. Clicking on stuff is mostly "hit and miss" situation since the active part of the cursor is just the fingertip. Combine that with the fact that you have to click directly on the stuff, like treasure chests and tiny imps - you've got yourself an annoying issue.\n\n2) Tooltips. Many reviewers already mentioned that they do not make any sense whatsoever and its true - instead of clear information about rooms its just some strings with numbers and abbreviations.\n\n3) UI. There is no way to soften the blow - its horrible in every possible way. The buttons are too small. The cursor is too big and hard to use (read 1). The minimap (again, made to resemble an original DK minimap) is completely useless and would've been appropriate in the year 95 - Microsoft paint blocks instead of actual rooms and enemies just won't cut in 2015.\n\n4) I've expected that with time and better optimization the game would demand less PC resources but unfortunately the opposite has happened. So just a heads up - you really DO need 6-8gb and more, as well as good CPU.\n\nUnfortunately the game has not met my expectations yet (in the basic controls department at least) and i've waited quite a bit already. I might change my mind later on, if the developer updates the UI though.\n","April 2, 2015","false","8.2"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","12","24","0","0"

Having spent a couple of hours on the campaign and having done about 5 of the maps this is how I feel about the experience:\nInitially I found it very good since so many things of what made Dungeon Keeper great was present and the game does have the potential for greatness.\nHowever I did find things which did chip away at the experience and in the end just made me close down the game and hope it improves before trying it again.\n\nMinor annoyancesYou can't continue playing the map after reaching your goal. So if you have missed a secret you can't go around exploring the map like you might be used to from DK.\nDragging an area for excavation bugs out.\nIf you try to let go of the mouse button while the mouse is over a gui element (minor annoyance really but it happens so frequently it does disturb "the flow" of the game for me).\n\nMajor annoyancesHard to visualize what is going on with the minimap.\nWhen you are being attacked I never got the sense that "the minimap will tell me exactly what is going on", but it didn't really because before I knew it my core was being assaulted by a group of mobs.\nThe notification tiles are missable and hard to understand at a glance.\nThe size, placement and icons for the notifications are just off, so I end up never relying on them because they are not in my face when they need to be, and when I take a look I can't really figure out what type of message they are. Don't know how many times I thought a minion was starving based on the icon but it was just a new arrival in the dungeon.\nZooming out is pretty limited.\nOn maps where you take over other NPCs rooms etc you never really get a chance to orientate yourself and figure out where things are since the camera is always sticking pretty close to the ground. Would be nice to get a bit more overview of your dungeon.\nRally minions button is so easy to forget to turn off.\nOn one map I forgot that I had rallied my minions 20 minutes ago and couldn't figure out why all my minions were complaining about being hungry and wanting to get paid etc.\nThe only visual feedback you get from it being activated is an extremely small Cancel icon next to the Rally icon turning red instead of grey. And the rally flag itself is pretty easy to miss amid surging minions.\nRally minions makes the minions daft.\nThe description says that all the minions will fight towards the banner. So if you have a banner placed and then pick up some minions and drop them by your core that is being attacked, you would expect them to dispose of the intruders and then walk back to the flag. But that's not the way it seems to work. They just blindly walk back to the flag most of the time, even if they run across multiple enemies on the way.\nThe mouse pointer is hard to target with.\nWhen you hover over a excavatable land the cursor turns into a hand with a pickaxe and for all other elements in the game it becomes a hand with a pointing finger. For some reason this transitioning animation is making it very hard to me to accurately click buttons or select things. My brain gets the impression that the tip of the cursor is closer to the hand. The animation is slow enough that it will be noticeable when you need to do stuff quickly.\nTab hell.\nThere are a lot of tabs going on in the interface, even though there is a lot of room left when you have a decent resolution.\nThere is the room tab, units tab, spells tab, constructs tab, defenses tab, potions tab and rituals tab (so far anyway, maybe there will be more in the later levels). It is a lot of tab switching and there doesn't seem to be any hotkeys for it either. Given the vast space left at the bottom of the screen it feels like they could utilize the area better to reduce the number of tabs. For example having one area for building (rooms, defenses, constructs) and another for the other stuff. Then at least you have more functionality available on the screen at any given time.\nNo quick way to check the status of your rooms.\nYou can right click on a room in the rooms tab and it will bring you to that room. If you have multiple instances of the same room you click it multiple times. But you don't have a way to view the stats of your rooms, which is very interesting for dungeon management, so you know when it is time to build a new lair due to lack of space.\nNot easy to see why a specific minion is unhappy.\nYou see a minion run by with a big frown on their icon and you of course want to know why. The information is hidden in the expansive tooltip somewhere but as the minion is still moving it proves to be a mighty task to simultaneously keep following it with the mouse while trying to browse the text in the tooltip (which has A LOT of information).\nIn general the tooltip is relied upon for way too much and contains the combined lore and stats for whatever you are hovering over which is way too much information when you are in a hurry.\nThey would benefit much over reducing the information or adding situational information somewhere in the game area instead (like a small chicken next to the frowny face when a minion is hungry, or a small flag in every room which contains the basic stats for the room you are hovering over)\n\n\nMany of these things can be argued that they are very trivial, but when it is so many things at once it becomes a draining experience. Many of the things are related to keeping abreast of the situation in your dungeon, which is pretty much what the entire game is about. Then you want these things to be spot on, you should never feel like you don't have the tools to understand what is going on, and being properly notified with huge flashing icons etc when your dungeon core is being attacked etc.\n\nThat being said I do hope it does get an extra coat of polish and refinement, because I have waited very long for a game like this to resurface but as it currently stands I can't really recommend it, though I can recommend that you keep abreast with news about the game in hopes that it will get the polish it deserves in future patches.","August 4, 2015","false","5.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

Secondly This game is a Dungeon managment game where you are the EVIL UNDERLORD (Queue Thunder and Lightning) where you are basically wreaking the "good guys" by building a dungeon that attracts creatures to your "humble" abode. Like DK you do have to pay them and keep them fed as well as train you creatures to destroy the damnable heros for your conquest.\n\nthere is of course some tidbits that makes the game like DK great like SLAPPING THE IMPS TO MAKE THEM WORK FASTER or "accidently" killing one or two or.....I think you get it\n\nSounds and Music\nthe music is fitting as well as the sounds you can feel the dread that you cause your enemys muhahahaha...erm...sorry, as far as the dialog goes you can tell the voice acter has waaaaaay too much fun which is a plus  and there is some funny quips and you also can hear what some of your creatures say some things.\n\nStory\nthe story is well basic as far as I can go with it but that because I am typing this up when I got to level/map 4 so I dont urge my self to spoil anything but if anything the goal and the story is entertaining and clear cut.\n\nGraphics\nI am strickly a gameplay kind of person I would say look at the snapshots and Vid to judge for yourself It looks good enough for me.\n\nRecommend\nI do recommend this game but keep in mind that there is some parts that still have issues and is being worked on as we speak and there is not enough games where you are clearly the bad guy and loving it.\n\nand a summery of pros and cons to consider\nPros\nVoice acting\nGood Gameplay\nGreat nostalgia value (take that EA *shakeing fist*)\nIs updating a great deal\n\nCons\nThere is some glitches that happen\nthere were some frame drops\nsome features are not complete\n\nKeep in mind there is a huge number of updates that went through the passed couple of days so take it with a grain of salt","April 7, 2015","true","26.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You'll slip into a nostalgia coma as soon recognise every single component in this game from your previous DK experience.  They nailed it!  But this is also where the problem comes in.\n\nThe game is a graphically pleasing, humour-filled remake of DK and not so much a sequel. Sure enough there is a bloody good load of newly added components, such as the titan creatures and a "leveling" scheme which allows you to unlock traps, rooms and the odd creature using points called "sins".   Heck, they even have the original voice-over from the old DK games! Nostalgia overload.\nThe campaign is "alright" and provides you with around 9 hours worth of gameplay - less if you are just one of those gamers who nail-it fast.  I completed the campaign a day after I bought the game and then, you are stuck with very few options.  The sandbox modes are pretty much blank maps with infinate gold that allows you to quickly dig out enough space and place all of your dungeon rooms and summon all of your creatures - provides you with around 30 minutes of entertainment.\nMultiplayer is an excrutiating experience.  For those of you who have been playing games outside of steam's DRm, you'll remember those horrible tech nightmares where you had to go and mess about with your port settings, enabling UPnP on your routers and so on - the days we all thought were long gone since steam (and other DRM's) provided a platform that negates this.  Well, in the spirit of nostalgia you may well enough enjoy that experience in this game again.\n\nMultiplayer is stock standard, once you get it working.  Play against other opponents and squash them.  Whether it is you and a mate vs the AI (the developer's definition of Coop...if you can believe that) or whether it is two of you vs two other dungeoneers - all modes we should be fairly familiar with.\nThe actual coop which was hinted at during the kickstarter, though not reached, also seems to be not in the pipeline for the near future.  Now this does not mean it is off the table entirely, though it doesn't look to be soon.\nThe expansion, "Heart of Gold" (released two or three days prior to this review) adds about 4 - 6 hours worth of play in a campaign, some dungeon visuall candy for multiplayer and the odd spell here and there.  It's not an expensive expansion and therefor the little content can be quantified.\nOverall, the game's base price vs what you get for it is not good at all.  This is the kind of game we should be looking for during steam specials.  You will barely get a weekend's worth of playing from both the game and its current expansion and multiplayer is unlikely to entertain you for very long if you get past the uneccesary setup hassles.\nIn summary:\nThey absolutely succeeded in providing a nostalgic experience in the spirit of Dungeon Keeper. No one can compete.\nHowever, the game falls horribly short in providing an entertaining experience for more than an approximate 15 hours worth of play (more, maybe, if you really really like repeating the same actions).\nNo Coop (and mplay coop 2v2 does NOT constitute coop at all).\n\nThe game's development does not seem to be entirely finished and there "appears" to be some level of new content being planned.  This may very well be a boon to the current state of the game.  Though, if not getting this title on a good special I would suggest that you seek out the most recent reviews of newly added content on our usual trusty sources (i.e IGN, Gamespot, Gamasutra, Cooptimus).","May 30","false","27.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","14"

The developers have obviously wasted quite a bit of time on fancy models and graphics but not enough on UI design.  The UI makes even simple tasks quite difficult to accomplish the worst offender being that they replace your mouse cursor with a fancy animated hand that you can never tell quite what is being pointed at without waiting for the cursor highlighting to catch up.\n\nThe scale on which things happen also tends to make things difficult.  The overall map is quite large relative to the individual unit and the player base is required to be somewhat large to support any decent number of units and the units themselves are quite tiny.  Zoom in to issue orders to units and you cant navigate the map as easily, zoom out to navigate and you cant issue orders as effectively; there is no zoom level where you can effectively do both.","May 28","false","1.4"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","14","28","0","3"

I'm about four missions in, and it is essentially the same game Dungeon Keeper was with a graphical overhaul. Feels almost like it's running the exact same engine with higher resolution textures.\n\nIt's been about 18 years since Dungeon Keeper came out, but War for the Overworld plays essentially the same as it's predecessor. Games have changed and improved quite a bit in that time, but WFTO is stuck in the past.\n\nThe Good:\nSame quirky atmosphere you likely enjoyed with Dungeon Keeper.\nSimple, casual gameplay. Nice voice acting. A pleasant way to spend a few hours.\n\nThe Bad:\nAI is generally clunky and bad on both sides. Your minions are not very bright, but neither is the enemy.\nMany maps are so full of caverns and holes that you can't really design a dungeon the way you want it to look. The map forces your hand in most cases. Combat is a complete mobfest, and usually involves dropping everthing and the kitchen sink onto your enemies heads, spamming heals and shooting some lightening. There is no strategy required.\n\nThe Verdict:\nDid you like Dungeon Keeper? Do you want to play it again with unit reskins and higher resolution graphics? If so, then sure, grab this game. If you want a deep and strategic dungeon building game then you will have wait because this isn't it and nobody has made it yet.","April 4, 2015","false","2.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

This game has all of the style of DKII that I was expecting and it has far more units, rooms, spells, and other creative features.

It has the look and feel of the original, but is essentially unplayable. Which is HUGELY disappointing. Although my profile says "10 hours played", I lasted about 10 minutes.\n\nI went straight into Sandbox mode. Firstly, there is some crazy mouse lag which I haven't figured out yet. Also, NO minions came through  - I had imps and nothing else, even though I made sure I had created all the available rooms 5x5. And only the basic rooms were available (slaughterhouse, treasure room, "bedroom").

Creatures just run to my core and die, or my creatures are 4-6 levels ahead of the empire/other underlords. There needs to be a difficulty mode implemented for players that like a challenge. Also the level designs are somewhat discouraging to futher me wanting to play more. Every single level just has water/lava/small corridors/impentrable rocks everywhere so I'm not allowed to make my dungeon how I'd prefer to make it. The empire traps are very weak, the crossbow you see on the 2nd/3rd level are very inaccurate. It lands a shot 10% of the time. I could go on but you get the just of how a veteran Dungeon Keeper 2 player forms his opinion of WftO as of its current state on patch 1.2. In comparison to this campaign levels/design to DK2, DK2 is better in most aspects, even the difficulty - DK2 had a very casual player difficulty campaign, but there were some maps atleast that even casual players had a time beating. Unlike yours truly.\n\nAnother side note is the Vein of Evil - The spells you get are so imbalanced, can destroy entire armies just by spamming certain spells in a corridor because there are no cooldowns and do too much aoe damage.","September 27, 2015","false","3.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The game itself is good, but bugs, lack of proper tooltips, and omg memory leaks. I have 16g of ram and on lvl 4 of campain it ate 8g then crashed.\n\nBuilding: Tutorial says 3x3 minimum for builds, but doesn't say if 3x4 is better or a waste of space. 6x6 adds another device so one would have to conclude 3x3 or 3x6 or it's wasted space. Rooms don't need walls so rip it all down except your chokepoint to enemy.\n\nMinion AI: lol, have a full 6x9 slaughter pen and a empty 3x3 pen and minions are afraid of starving to death.\nWorkers don't multitask, they all tear down walls or they all convert blocks or they all mine gold (even if gold is capped..lol) or they all sit idle.\nScout beasts engage enemy instead of scouting.\n\nTool tips: Some are still displaying script descriptions. Most that are working have data stretched horizontaly so it goes 1/4 to 1/2 way across screen. Most info is irrelevant and needed info is no where to be found.\n\nHand and Camera: [del] key for camera tilt movement...really? that key should be to get rid of unwanted worker that was summoned over cap thats costing mana.\nScreen edge movement is good, but hard to hit minimize button in left hand corner.\nAs with all rts type games, camera does not scroll out far enough. (Curse you Warcraft 3 for starting that crap.)\n\nEnemy AI: lol, healers heal themselves or attack instead of healing the tank. Assasins chase a goblin accross map instead of staying with battle group. Dwarves think they are tanks. Tanks spin around and around till they are dead not knowing who to hit.\n\nTraps: What traps? Death blosson is just a wall. Cannons are defense not a trap. It needs traps that do damage once to an unsuspecting mob.\n\nModels: Other than the fact that they are all carbin copies (no unique faces, racial pigment or even hair color) The humanoids look good for the most part, but monsters look like a 2000 game (see Sacrifice by interplay). Succubus have wings BTW, do it right or call them S&M chicks. None of the models have a WOW that is cool feel except Shades.\n\nTextures: Heh, didn't I already tear down this group of walls? Oh this one is fortified, see the grey smudge on top....really? Water looks like brown poluted water from a city sim game. Madel textures are minimal and not very detailed.\n\nConcusion: Dungeon game? No it is a tower defense game that also lets you attack their tower after you get a zerg army together. So far this isn't even a diamond in the ruff, it is a turd with sugar sprinkled on it. Why everyone is so fixated with a 1997 game? Dungeon Keeper was good but expand on it. If you could combine Dungeons(Kalypso) with this game it would be good start. They both had a good thing, but to many want to play DK and DK2. Have it so you keep what you build and expand out into the world taking territory. Whats the point in building a dungeon to not have invaders?\nAt this time I can not recomend this game. Will try again in a month...maybe.\n\n\n","April 6, 2015","false","6.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It's unfinished, buggy, poorly optimized, and the mechanics are opaque at best.\n\nThe content, as it is, is water thin at the moment with a thirteen level campaign against a ♥♥♥♥ easy AI and three 1v1 AI skirmish maps. Patches were promised, but they have yet to manifest themselves.  The bugs are also still pretty bad. I am currently stuck on level nine because the game consistently crashes when I'm roughly halfway through with the mission.\n\nWorst of all, the game lacks the sort of interesting interactions and special units that made Dungeon Keeper so intriguing. Building oddly shaped or larger than usual rooms bring no additional benefits. You'll never have a super cultist or unique monster appear in your dungeon. Furthermore, the inclusion of a so-called tech tree is haphazard at best.

As a hardcore fan of the Dungeon Keeper series, I wanted this game to succeed very, very badly. The sad thing is that, it does! It's just technically unplayable.\n\nThere are no bugs, or not to my experience at least. No glitches, weird errors, crashes, or anything of the sort. And the gameplay is very, very funny, and exciting!\n\n(NOTE: Many players have reported a great number of bugs! I just personally haven't run into any, and made it to lvl 3 of the campaign without encountering any glitches and or bugs.)\n\nHowever, as I approached the end of the third campaign level, in which you VS another underlord, with spells like you posess also, the game went total ape ♥♥♥♥. I haven't been able to fix it, and no solutions are to be found anywhere on the www at all.\n\nThe level went well, until I came into actual contact with my opposer. The AI controlled underlord, started casting all sorts of spells on my creatures as they pushed the edges of his base back, slowly but surely. The FPS dropped immediatly as the casting began, to 2 - 7 FPS.\n\nNow before you all start questioning my specs, and wether or not my pc should be able to handle this title. I run some top of the notch hardware. Two GTX Titans overlocked in SLI , 64-bit, 32GB RAM, Intel Core I7-4930K CPU 3.40GHZ.\n\nThey have yet to invent a game that my system can't handle, so no excuses developers!\n\nI am literally halted in my tracks.  And I can't play the game I payed for any further, until this matter is resolved. Therefor, I advice all potential buyers to WAIT, and not purchase this title, until a fix has been provided officially.\n\nOnce there is a fix, I'll consider providing a positive piece of feedback.\n\nThe devs have made several posts on the community hub, in which they state they've 'improved the FPS issues' however, I've had no confirmation of this what so ever, nor any positive feedback regarding this subject from any other buyers.\n\nGood game, terribly optimized!\n\nFix this, so we can play this gem in the rough!","April 3, 2015","false","4.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

What I got was a game that forced me to rush and I couldn't sit back and enjoy.\n\nI wanted to love this game. Back in my youth I played the origional Dungeon Keeper to absolute death. What I loved about that was the humour and the ease of building a dungeon and that if you wanted you could sit back and stratergise and do well, or speed out and rush and hit the objectives hard and fast before your opponant knew what was happening.\n\nWftO however seemed to rush me to constantly rush and attack and make rash choices about where to dump rooms or dig, or force me to build defenses with no proper set up. I found myself unable to plan leaving rooms exposed and routes to my dungeon core easy to exploit.\n\nThe humour is there, but it feels forced, thus making it not that funny at all.\n\nIn just 2 hours, I'd already gotten through 6 of the 13 levels without trying hard at all. At that pace, I'd not even have gotten 6 hours out of the main campaign. Even buying it on sale, £15 for 6 hours gameplay is pushing things.\n\nThe problem is, there isn't really anything massively wrong with the game. Its well made, the graphics are nicely designed, the interface is easy to pick up and use.... Theres just a large number of small problems that chip away at the enjoyment and feel of the game making it one I can't recomend, even to fans of the genre.\n\n","October 30, 2015","false","1.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

Give them food and a place to sleep, train them to improve combat skills, and then send them out to kill the heroes. Some minions can research spells or construct traps. You can hold captured enemies in a prison, torture them to convert them to your cause, or let them die so their corpses can turn into undead minions at a graveyard.\n\nThere's a fun, dark sense of humour, especially thanks to the advisor, who is the same voice actor from Dungeon Keeper. As a fan of DK, it really does feel like everything I'd want to see from an unofficial sequel.\n\nI wish I could end the review there with a positive recommendation. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of WFTO has been spoiled by terrible technical performance. I've suffered from two significant problems.\n\nThe first is a very frequent "stutter", where everything freezes for about a second. Its not game breaking, but it is very annoying, especially when you're moving the camera around the map.\n\nThe second - and far more serious - problem, is a progressively worsening framerate, which seems to be related to how much of the map you can see, and how many creatures and traps are active in the map. At the start of a level, everything is covered by the fog of war, so my framerate is a nice smooth 60. But as I explore, the more of the map I uncover, and the more creatures are recruited by myself and the enemy, the framerate starts to die. It doesn't seem to be related to any graphics option - I've got the same problem with every setting at maximum and every setting at minimum. The engine just can't cope with so many moving objects in such a large space.\n\nThere are 13 levels in the campaign, and as you would expect, the later maps are larger and everybody has a bigger army. During the first half of the campaign the framerate hit isn't so bad, dipping to around 40, which is still playable. But from around level 8, it got much worse, at times being almost like a powerpoint slideshow. I'm not exaggerating when I say my framerate was dipping into single figures.\n\nI have a significantly more powerful PC than the recommended specs listed on the store page (Win7 64 bit, Quad core i7 2600k @ 3.4Ghz, 8GB Ram, GTX 770 with 4GB Vram) so I should be able to run this kind of game without a problem. A quick search on the forum and other reviews indicates I'm not alone.\n\nUltimately, in the current state, I have no choice but to give a negative review. Its a shame, because judging by the gameplay alone, WFTO is a good game. But this level of performance is unacceptable. Wait a few months, see if the developers can improve the performance with some patches. (Note: I started playing the day AFTER patch 1.1.15 was released, so 1.1.15, which supposedly improved performance, is still terrible).","July 6, 2015","false","11.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

But I say that because by the time it goes on sale, it should have more content and most of the bugs out of the system. But if you've been waiting for Dungeon Keeper 3, look no further than this.\n\nAt the time of review, I had completed the campaign and dipped a little into the skirmish mode. As far as tech problems, I've only had two of note and both happened on level 10. I had the game freeze for 10 minutes when I did a ritual that revealed the enemy dungeon. And I tried to reload a save for it and it didn't load. Other than that the only other tech problems I've had is really nothing that cannot be solved with graphic adjustments in the options menu. If you're experiencing game breaking bugs, you might want to consider the age of your hardware and upgrade the parts that are over five-years old.\n\nDespite the bugs and the lack of content in the skirmish, I've had a fantastic time with this game. The campaign, while a glorified tutorial, is quite good whether you're an old player or new to this type of game. I played Dungeon Keeper 2 for comparison and my verdict is that it is pretty much DK 2 with the polish that didn't exist in 1999 and with addtions that add to overall experience rather than detract. I found the use of Potions and Rituals to be an interesting addtion to the formula. And you'll come to love the Narrator, who is from the original game, as the way that he delivers his dialouge is such a joy to listen to. I would put him the Hall of Fame where they reconigze voice talents like the narrators from "Stanley Parable" and "Basition".\n\nThis game definately is going to be worth having but it's going to happen several patches down the line. To their credit, they are coming out with patches at a quick rate but this game definately could've used another month in Early Access to polish up their assests. Heck, you can still see the Unity engine titles when you hover over units. I don't know whether it was money and/or the bad reputation Early Access has gotten the past year that prompted them to release it in this state, but it thankfully doesn't detract from the overall game experience and the game is backed by a good studio. We haven't really gotten a good successor to Dungeon Keeper and this is by far a worthy successor to the concept.","April 12, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This is the same voice actor from orignal dungeon keeper heh, and even the guys making it started as a gaming clan I believe that evolvd into I think modding then eventually after years I suppose they started learning more and more. Got tired of waiting for a dungeon keeper and well made a killer game that is just like the old one enchanced but not ruined in any way thanks to them being loyal fans of the orignal game you wont feel lost in your dungeon building!\n\nIf you never played dungeon keeper shame on you! Check some videos out on this game and dungeon keeper, I am sure you will enjoy this. Don't forget its still in early acces and getting cooler and cooler they just recently added multiplayer!","October 16, 2014","true","7.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That would not be a bad thing, only I have found it buggy and extremely slow.  It has never exited without crashing, room tiles vanish without a reason, sometimes can't pick up creatures from your prison, takes minutes to load on a computer that runs Skyrim with ease, etc.\n\nIt also badly needs a manual to understand many of the features, which is a shame because a lot of thought obviously went into some of them.  Some of the voice acting is pretty good too.  I feel bad saying this about something trying to carry the flag of a game I love, but I can't recommend it.  It suffers from being too like the original without enough added content or new features, and it seems to run worse than the original did on far older ones.","July 20, 2015","false","34.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sithious/recommended/230190/","Sithious","Nutty Name","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sithious/","497 products in account","What to say about this one? well I can't really say I was too disappointed by this game because it is the true Dungeon Keeper successor and I was never able to play that game due to it being too old and too finicky with modern systems to get running but I really wasn’t impressed by anything in this game either. It has good intentions but it's really not all that interesting, even going along the campaign and unlocking new abilities, traps and room types the game never got more exciting than the 'oh yay new dungeon management game, im sure this will be good!' thrill at the start.\n\nHere are categories on why I was barely able to enjoy the game:\n\nStoryline: 3/10What storyline? It's so bland and forgettable I'm pretty sure it's there so the devs could say 'we made a storyline!'. I can sum it in afew sentences. Your evil and stuff, you get betrayed by alot of other evil people you have kill on the way to the top, once you kill all forces of good and become the most evil dungeon lord you get betrayed in a very obvious way you could have predicted way ahead of time and poof game done, yep… seat clenching. It is a shame because surely someone can think of a neat storyline for an evil dungeon lord coming from the bottom all the way to the top of the world? Even if it was taken non seriously like a joke, “They made fun of your really cool hat, knocked over your letter box and keep killing your zombie collection for fun, they must pay!” might have been better. Meh, not a big gripe for a game like this but it never really feels like I have any incentive to killing all these 'good' characters and ruining their world other then, your bad mkay? kill stuff cas the game gives you no other options, ugh. What did they look at me wrong? call my mum a bad name? Not put the toilet seat down?! Why do I hate them to the point of torturing them!? The game never explains that, if it even could, it's not very fulfilling at all and it just made me want to end the game as quick as possible.\n\nCampaign: 4/10It took me barely 8 to 10 hours to get done, not alot of depth, not alot variety, a very linear experience from one click spot to the next, I don't know what more to say about this that wouldn’t repeat the storyline section, with no engaging storyline to follow the campaign felt pretty bland and meaningless. I was only doing it to get my monies worth out of the game about half way in and it just left me so unsatisfied at the end I ditched the game right after finishing it and never plan to come back to that waste of time and effort. If you’re looking for an amazing single player experience in this I’m sorry look somewhere else...\n\nGraphics and Visuals: 3/10Oh boy is this a major gripe. This must have been made on an old Unity engine cas as far as advancing gaming graphics goes it looks terribad, and I really wish I was exaggerating. Great models and textures but not the right game engine to show them off in! Even the lighting in this is nothing special, there is no real visual evidence that your dungeon is as evil ,dark and monster filled underground hell as it is supposed to be, I was never really fully immersed by it and that's such a disappointment. Oh yea and don't even get me started on the joke of an anti-aliasing option... it's either have sharp visuals with jaggies for days or mega FXAA that blurs the whole game to such a degree you can barely make out the details of a single object or texture *shudders*. Just, no, if you appreciate graphics like me you will have a depressing time here, again all this is to blame for the crappy Unity engine they chose.\n\nPerformance: 2/10Performance, oh boy! You can imagine a game that's not open world with not much going on and poor visual fidelity will run great right? Well no, not at all, no hopes, again the Unity engine strikes to make this game run dreadfully on my gtx980 with 16gbs of RAM semi top of the range rig. On the last few missions my frame rate got down to a solid 12! I crap you not, 12!! If I was lucky I got 17 fps. With no optimization to be heard of this game will run like the alternative name for a donkey as soon as your dungeon gets to any decent size. I could have turned down the graphics maybe, but it already looked bad enough with no blurry AA on I didn't dare try, and on a gtx 980 why the heck should I have to?! Top of the line graphics cards aren't cheap for a reason right?\n\nVariety: 7/10Moving off the biggest gripes, the variety is pretty good, a large range of different room types which also equal a different minion type for most of them, spells, traps, side powers you can call on to help you out abit and even little ease of life constructs. The enemy sends you a decent variety of enemies to annihilate and you even fight other underlords at afew points, this is all great, if it weren't for the insanely boring combat that you have to endure with to progress...\n\nCombat: 3/10About all you can do is possession control a minion for some FPS interesting involvement but that gets boring quick due to a single minion never being able to make that much difference even while played by you. The only other thing you can do to help combat is the healing and rage spells and zapping enemies with lightning if they go on any of your territory and slip by, other than that it's just misc helpful spells to run the dungeon and spamming the attack banner around so your stupid minions actually move and attack everything else, nothing goes much deeper than that. Maybe I wasn’t being creative or was missing something? But I doubt it because I tried everything I was given, waiting for a crud ton of minions to spam then just blob charging them at the enemy was the only thing that seemed to work so I went with it for the whole campaign, not very engaging. =/\n\n\nCONCLUSION: Total 4/10I guess after all that the only final conclusion can be... don't waste your time and effort on this, really just don't. This is quite frankly the most boring dungeon management game I’ve played so far, it does nothing new from Dungeon 1, Dungeon 2 and Impire, I can actually say that Dungeon 2 is more fun purely because of interesting mechanics and a playable dungeon lord that always gives you something to do! This game however will consistently show you how bland an unengaging, unsatisfying management game can be. Other than building 5x5 basic 'blocked' rooms and doing some spells and building traps I never really felt like I had any reason to be in this game 'helping'. A disappointing shame but it happens, bad engine and not enough thought and depth put in by the devs. Even the management in Overlord 2 was cooler lol, the minions in that game had personality and where so loveably evil and fun.\n\nBuy this when it's majorly on sale if you really want or find something else because this really is a hit and miss for me and mind you I have played every dungeon management game I have found so far so hopefully everything I said holds enough water for you to believe me, because this review is in -your- interests.\n\nThanks for reading, game smart, game on.","March 12","false","11.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I have tried playing multiple times and every time I run into some game-halting bug. Each time I try playing, I ending up stopping to wait for the bugs to get fixed. When I first started the game was in early access so I decided to cut them some slack. But now it's the full version of the game and I still can't play because of these bugs that basically make gameplay impossible.\n\nI really want to like this game. It's a fun concept and the devs have obviously done a ton of work on it and made an almost-great product. But the focus seems to be entirely on adding content rather than making sure the existing content works. It doesn't matter how great your graphics are, how many levels you have, and how many different rooms and spells and monsters you've thrown into the mix.

Wait 6-12 months for it to be properly ready.\n\n\nUPDATE: Since writing the Original review, the game has Launched. Unfortunately, It is still far from what I would consider "complete" The Single player campaign has frequent issues (server slowdown/freezes/crashes/Bugs out and after completing the objective nothing happens). These can be gotten around by re-playing the level but you really shouldn't have to do that. There is a servere lack of content beyond the single player campaign too. There is alot of stuff "comming" but a released game should be COMPLETE. If it's not ready, leave it in early access. If this was still in early access I could definitely recommend it. The game has alot of potential, and in 6 months to a year, I think it will be a really great game. Unfortunately, It's just not complete. IF you don't mind playing a "released" game that is basically still in Beta, then you WILL NOT be dissapointed. However, if you are after a complete game.

I'll continue by pointing out some downfalls: compared to the first 2 there's not many improvements in my opinion; it seems to be made to be a lot easier too, hence 10 hours to complete campaign (with 5 crashes); It feels like it's still in beta, which i will now expand upon but first let me point out i have not read what the developers have to say about current state & patch roadmaps because I shouldn't have to, Someone releases a game and you expect it to be ready for release: This is not.\nI'll be light on this subject because if you dont care about these things, you'll enjoy the game, I know i did.\n\nFirst, too many towers crashes the game; that's right, a dungeon defense game and if you build too many defenses, it will crash. One mission in particular, campaign mission 9, you have to defend a bottleneck which is of course perfect for towers but no, build them and after 2 mins you'll be restarting.\n\nSecondly, it's obviously not finished, mouse over a minion and it will tell you their current task which almost always is psuedocode, for example (and I'm paraphrasing here ) you will see current task do_GOLD_prop(dugeon.heart)  instead of 'get paid'  or get_raw_food_prop(pigfarm) instead of 'eat micropig'; further to this the interface doesn't work as it should, want to see your list of minions? it will often forget to turn the boundery of the list into scroll bars so you can only see the first 6 or 7 types of minion.\nThirdly it takes an insane amount of RAM, I'm not sure if there's a leak in there or whether it doesn't use GFX dedicated ram properly but 4.5Gb of RAM to run? Dont get me wrong, I have enough RAM but DAMN, that's more than any other game in my library (and i have a lot).\n\nSo yes, plays well if you dont build towers or use the ritual ro reveal the enemy dugeon (yup, that's a crash too!), nothing too immersion breaking on the interface apart from being able to only see half your force and taking 2 seconds to see what your minion is doing instead of 1/2 a second and if you dont have much RAM you may have performance issues, apart from that, a 9 hour sp experience(if you dont crash), only 3 skirmish maps, all very small & multiplayer/survival is still not working right now.\n\nTL:DR\nslapped a micropig, it squeeled and popped and made me smile, 12/10 now stop reading reviews if you cant be bothered to read.","May 7, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Was a backer (even though the title wasn't given due to the fact that my pay method wasn't accepted for it).  In the last 2 days this game has been patched with steadfast determination.  I have followed this game for YEARS.  It is one of the very few games out there that promised and delivered after a ton of ups and down within the production.  The game in itself is made with the Unity engine.  The DK series was a favorite of mine from the beginning, and was a kick to the balls when EA bought it and did what they do best.  Round filed it.  These ppl saw a community who was begging for more from the DK title, and took it upon themselves to dev WftO, even though they had to cover their azzes to keep the game in the spirit of the DK genre while making it their own.  This group never promised anything it didn't deliver.  Not once in the promotion of the game did they make it look like it was anything but what it is.  I have faith in this product to be a quality piece.  I have played many games that were top titles that were released in WAY worse shape, and WAY more expensive.\n\nI give this game 10 thumbs up and played it for about 66 hrs.  It had some laggy issues with the AI pathing which seemes to have been patched out, and 2 bugs with completion which also has been fixed.  If you want a blast from the past with a new twist, this game is a definite buy.  If you are worried about the bugs, give it a day or 2 to let them sort out the release and then buy it.  This is a must for anyone that is a fan of the DK series, or the "god" game genre.  I have been reporting and watching the WftO forums, and I must say that not once have they not replied quickly to any reports or comments.\n\nHop to see you soon Underlord!","April 3, 2015","true","88.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It appears the game was rushed to release early, on purpose, since the developer's tool tips are still in the game and appear when you hover your mouse over anything (complete with error and bug notices).  One must assume the early release was out of fear of the competing product, "Dungeons 2" which is due out in a few days.  The rush to beat a competitor to market resulted in a  broken game.

You did like it right? Well there's nothing else to say then, for the remaining people, continue reading.\nWar for the Overworld is a RTS game which puts you in the shoes of an Underlord: a mystical being which has the power of creating dungeons and using the forces of evil (minions and so...). The purpose of the game itself is to build your own dungeon, and that's where all the fun lies. Many Underlords prefer building traps, other train their creatures to death in order to slay enemies, others use a mixture of both. While doing so you also know how to use some magic that can help your cause. To build your dungeon you have workes to help you, just tell them where to dig, what to do and they will without fail. By creating space you can start build rooms that will attract creatures to your dungeon.\nPretty interesting right? Well, the campaign is well done but incosistent: some moments are far too easy and some other are hell itself. I haven't yet tried the multiplayer, but the game is actively developed and I think there will be many interesting suprises with time.

Its about one in the morning after my mate gets off skype and goes to bed. I see a patch for underworld. So I download it and look at the notes and said the memory leak should be fixed and I was like oooo.So tried it out.\nLoaded it up and instantly the menu says "isn't it past your bedtime underlord". I was like what the ♥♥♥♥. Is this my girlfriend telling me to go to bed since its 1 in the morning? Haha anyway load up my save from one of the campaign levels that had been lagging like hell it ran smoothly I was loving it. After completing the level I instantly moved onto the next one, feeling int the zone. Next level after defending for 30 mins I held strong. I then counter attacked and lost my army but they had nothing left so I built up another army. I built this army up for ages and it got massive.\n\nSo this is where it gets funny right? Just as I have spent 1 hour building this army up and half an hour defending so I have spent an hour and a half on this l level. I had a insanely complicated dungeon with defenses everywhere and ward so I could see everything inside their base.\nI knew how Many troops they had and where they were etc I had built a massive army and waited till they were all like level 8. So after 2 hours playing the games and an hour and a half being spent on this one level.... I sold a tile to build a lair on it as my army was so big then I was gonna attack and win the level. So I sell the tile and........freeze.\n\nI wait and I wait and I wait and it comes up with games not responding. I say wait for game to respond and this goes up for a bit where it keeps saying it's not responding and I keeep saying wait. Eventually I realise the game was dead so Clicked close program. I load up the game straight away to see if. I have anything left on the level I had spent an hour and a half doing.\n\nIt loads up. Menu proceeds to says "Underlord. Go to bed." At this point I'm thinking ♥♥♥♥ you. You did not just crash my game and my dungeon and my level that I had spent ages doing and now your telling me to go to bed? ♥♥♥♥ you. So go into save games. Nothing there. I will have to restart the level. At this point I close the game and go to bed.\n\nI hate it's guts but due to the addicting nature of the game I will end up redoing the level tomorrow. Even though this game has frustrating moments like this, It did cause me to stay up until like 3am playing it. It is massively fun and the bugs are rare. It was my fault I had not saved.\n\n10/10 would rage again lol 10/10 would play again.","April 14, 2015","true","15.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even with the game still being fixed and with all the bugs it was enjoyable, but the fact that the bugs make the game unplayable at times made it really annoying.\nWhile playing the game I felt it was pushing you to complete it, rather unlike DK 1 and 2, were you could build your dungeon and plan and plot.\nPlacing traps in DK 1 and 2 were useful, in this game not so much, as when heroes or enemy creatures hit level 5 then the traps prove useless and ineffective.\nOverall, out of the whole game, there were only 3 or 4 levels where you could just build your dungeon and then expand outwards.\nAlso in the last mission the cinematic was really disappointing, it was predictable and so short I felt cheated.","April 12, 2015","true","64.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The minimap is a pixelated mess.  Overall, not really all that fun and very time-consuming.  I wish I hadn't spent the money that I did on it.  The mouse is even an annoying hand.  I mean, do yourself a favor, and instead of playing through the levels on this where you really can't build your own dungeon (the campaign are all missions which tell you specifically what to do, and I can only assume the multiplayer would be even worse glitch-wise) and get something good like Command and Conquer if you're all about the overhead gameplay.  This leaves very little room for your own style of play, which is what really made it a negative for me.  I culd try to assume maybe it was my alienware that wasn't running to spec, but the glitches are numerous, it takes forever to load, the graphics leave something to be desired, etc.  It's just a pain in the ♥♥♥ to play, and when I go to attack with my minions and beasts, half of them don't pay attention to the rally flag, hich is another negative as you can only command your people to go to one place.  There is also no group selection or anything of the sort.  Either tell ALL of them to go HERE or leave them to their business.  This leaves no way to strategize about letting production continue and defend with certain minions, etc.  Overall, this is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ game in my opinion, and a waste of time if you're looking for something that allows for real RTS.","April 8, 2015","false","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Difficult to give a thumbs up here, as much as I want to give one to the spiritual successor of some of my favourite games, which I loved so much that I actually bought WFTO once on Kickstarter and once in Steam.\n\nIn terms of mechanics it mostly works all right, except for that weird bug where prisoners keep dying as they are dropped into prison (just save and reload) and that thing where Revelation never ends so you can't use another ritual. Mostly all right. Performance and graphics wise it's decent. Just don't expect nifty extras like the special torture animations for different characters, here they are all the same.\n\nBut the single player campaign missions... so simplistic and skeletal compared to Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 both. Whoever designed the missions have not benchmarked their work against the predecessors and told themselves they must do better; it is more like they have never tried the old ones. It is a real shame to see all the working mechanics but such poor missions. By the time the game ends you probably won't even have tried half the spells/traps/rituals/potions/ on offer and easily never use several room types and minion types, the mission are just that insipid and easy. Everything is "kill everything".\n\nBalance issues abound as well. It is simply too easy to convert enemies quickly, DK 1 and 2 had the same issue but not quite so strongly. This makes supposedy tough missions trivial - defeat the first enemy wave and you immediately have enough minions to steamroll all the objectives. This goes hand in hand with the bizarre abundance of infinite gold resource on so many single player missions - it makes the game trivially easy! I finished it all and never even tried ghouls, or spirits, or vampires.. because you don't need it when you have 50 monsters fighting a handful.\n\nI have not tried the multiplayer. It is difficult to give it a try when the single player was always wonderful in DK1 and DK2 and so different here.\n\nOverall the campaign felt painfully abbreviated vs DK1 or DK2 and the ending was emotionally a big letdown as well. You should NEVER have a situation in a game where the boss died in 10 seconds and his taunts then play one after another for half a minute! Seriously devs..\n\nI guess it's worth buying if it's on 50% sale, or if they have some kind of free expansion with another 15 missions.\n\nREALLY hope this game becomes moddable so people can step in with proper single player mission designs and rebalance things like how easy torture conversion is. Don't need your voiceovers. Just good missions.","June 23, 2015","false","18.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is only one lvl, so that also sucks. the sandboxs are only to build everything. thats boring after 20 mins. im only giving this game a thumbs up because overlord was alot of fun. but this isn't a beta, its more an alpha. but thats my opinion.","February 13, 2014","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

To start with the UI is very slow, like 2-3 seconds slow. Leaving for some very choppy gameplay, ive reported this on the official forum and after a month there has still been no fix, ive since asked the devs again if anything will be done about this with no response, im guessing they have given up with this bug. During my play through of the game ive encountered around 40 to 60 crashes and as of right now I am still not able to get past level 7 due to game breaking bugs. I will update my review when they have fixed all of the game breaking bugs.","May 14, 2015","false","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
