You simply have to drag the snakes to the position the game requires within the length of the snake. The more snakes that are involved, the trickier this gets as you need to prioritise getting shorter snakes to the goal first.","January 24","true","0.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

It's really addicting and pleasant to look at. It's also the right balance of challenging and relaxing. I curse at the game just enough to feel like I'm working my brain, but not enough to feel constantly frustrated. Overall it's a really decent puzzle game to pass the time, and if you need a neutral/positive distraction from anxiety or stressful situations, it could really help.\n\nUsually I'd rather play this kind of game online for free, but I think it's worth buying because you can tell that a lot of attention and personality went into the game and it's nice to support indie developers.","December 25, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","5","5","5","0"

Controlling them is a bit cumbersome too, but ironically easier on the harder levels (as theres less options) It's an alright concept, but i wouldnt say its worth the price.","January 25","false","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The puzzles begin simple but ramp up in difficulty. Some of the 4 and 5-snake puzzles were really tough to solve and I enjoyed the challenge. The art and music are perfect for this type of game - clean, colorful, and not distracting.\n\nThough I haven't used it much, I imagine that the puzzle creator could easily extend the playtime of this game to several hours.\n\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with Snake Blocks. For a game under $5, it's a nice change of pace.","December 27, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your snake will often go in unintended directions because the tolerance between them is wonky, and then when you try to back it up it'll go loop around some more.","February 8","false","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But the Puzzle was so boring and easy.\nLevel design was failure(Is it rude expression?). It should be adjusted step by step.\nCamera angle(View) was't switched  that I thought. That's really uncomfortable to move snake blocks.\nI ask developer to make keyboard manual. Like "Diagonal driection" key or "Confirm to Place block" key or "Change checked color blocks to transparent(see-through)"key. Click&drag is so comfortable manual but easy to misplace frequently.\n\nProbably I wouldn't recommend this game until fixing those few problems.","December 22, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Here it is and now I get to play it! How was it? at first impression, disappointing :(\n\n\n\nIt's a good idea. I'll say that, but it has a few problems (which will hopefully be fixed by the time you're reading this). Starting off, mouse acceleration. This is a terrible thing for a puzzle game like this. And even if technically there is no actual mouse acc in this game, then the sensitivity or something, is screwed. The next flaw is MAJOR. From what I know (which is nothing) the levels you can create can be only played by you. That means the level editor is pretty much non-existant!!! However I'm not sure on this one and am waiting for a response from the dev about how the level editor works. However this game isn't ALL bad, I mean the gameplay is actually quite unique and it is actually pretty damn fun. I also like the easy access of the level editor and the unique visuals of the game. Oh, and yes. you will scratch your head numerous times while playing this game!\n\n6/10 Fun gameplay but not without some flaws\n\nPros:\n-Unique visuals\n-Fun gameplay\n-Challenging\n-Easy-to-use level-editor\n\nCons:\n-Weird mouse acceleration\n-Confusing level-editor","February 7","true","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
