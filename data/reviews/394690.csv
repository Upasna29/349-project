He told me that the milk guy actually stole it from him and we need to find the milk dude. A few moments later someone with a cop hat comes up asking whats wrong, and the guy says everything. The moment he finishes talking, the milk dude turns the corner, screams "AHW F**KING S**T!" and bolts!\n\nNext thing I know, me along with the cowboy, the cop, and like 6 other random people are chasing this milk guy around the lobby, shooting party poppers at him, all while he's screaming bloody murder:\n\n"I DIDNT STEAL IIIIITTTT!!!"\n"I BOUGHT IT ON CREGE'S LIST!!!"\n"DEAR F**KING DAIRY QUEEN, PLEASE HEeeELLLPPPP MMMMmmmMMmmMMeeeEEEeeEEeEeEEEE!!!!"\n\nI'll be at the hospital tomorrow due to the fact I can no longer breath properly...","April 14","true","17.7"," 185 of 198 people (93%) found this review helpful 226 people found this review funny","93","185","198","226","9"

I recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a social environment. The Owner and Developers have been working non-stop to create, update and fix this game. They also stream every second Friday on Twitch so players can see what they are working on, and what to expect in the next update. It has currently had 8 updates already. A very dedicated team. The Forums for this game are current, and players have the chance to really be heard on them. The best part of this game is that the community always comes first.

They've only recently put enough content in the game for it to be played for more than a half hour at a time.

The game has a lot of potential and I'm 100% happy with what I've played and seen of it so far, but not everyone will be.

Not only because they can't use copyrighted assets, but because they're adding cool new content.\nSo the developers are still the same, they didn't sellout or anything like that.\nIt's the same Towers, but not on Gmod. This is how a good game does it by itself, but they need time, money and support.\n\nThe good stuff!\n+ All old minigames are back (Virus, Ballrace and Minigolf, so far).\n+ New minigames out and coming soon.\n+ New items, new currency.\n+ Very nice graphics. (though read the not-so-good section as well)\n+ Developers are always there to answer any question.\n\nThe not-so-good stuff...\n- If you have a low-mid end PC, you won't be able to run it very well, specially when you're in a server with many people.\n- Virus doesn't feel the same (it feels much more fast paced, but maybe that's just me).\n- Character customization is very limited. I hope this changes in the future, because all people have the same body types atm.\n- Servers. This is what I don't like at all. 2 reasons:\n1. People won't be joining your condo because it's going to be another server, and that's just a waste of time.\n2. Too many servers that aren't official, even though they're dedicated. (so you'll see random people's dedicated servers filling up the list).\n- If you play a minigame in any server, if the host leaves, the minigame is over.\n- It doesn't feel like a community anymore, people just straight join into a minigame, or their condo. I don't know if there's any reason to join the plaza anymore. I miss the waiting queue for the minigames, but maybe this is more practical (I really wish everything would be in the same server though).\n- Some annoying bugs to fix, but you know, it's Early access.\n\nIf this game never grew and stayed the same as it is now, I'd actually rate this bad, but since the developers are so hard-working and dedicated, I have no problem giving this a good review, because I know it will get better.\nI was in the Private Alpha and content came out frequently and this doesn't seem to change. So give it a try, even if you don't play it now, you'll play it later for sure.","April 8","true","18.2"," 62 of 73 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","62","73","6","5"

It's the successor to the popular Mod for Garry's mod, Garry's Mod Tower, or GMT for short. Currently, when I'm reviewing this, there are four Game Worlds: Ball Race, Minigolf, Virus, and Planet Panic. I'll go ahead and break these down now.\n\nBall Race: Ever played Super Monkey Ball? Well, it's basically that, minus the world tilting.\n\nMinigolf: Do I really need to explain this one?\n\nVirus: Based on the TimeSplitter's gamemode, one player is infected and has to touch the other players to spread the infection. If the survivors last the time limit, then they win. If everyone gets infected, the infected win. The survivors have an arsenal of weapons to deal with the infected.\n\nPlanet Panic: An original Game World, where it's a sort of Capture the Flag, with a bunch of mini-flags that start off in the middle. You bring them back to your base. Sounds simple enough right? Well, the other team can steal your mini-flags for themselves, so make sure to protect them!\n\nAnd right now, that's about it.

This game is a standalone, updated version, if you will, of Gmod Tower. The game is essentially a social hub in which you can join mini-games and earn in-game credits to buy in-game items for your avatar and condo. The developers' commitment to squashing bug after bug and keeping the community involved in the process has been astounding. Their promise to provide free dlc and never have micro-transactions or subscription fees is a breath of fresh air. They do streams bi-weekly, setup polls to ask us what we think about upcoming decisions/plans, and join their plaza server from time to time to check in with us and moderate, if needed.\n\nHere's the bottom line: I highly recommend this game upon two contigencies:\n#1 You have a decent enough PC to play it. It's not highly optimized, but it's also not the worst EA game in that regard. They've improved performance already in the short time the game has been out.\n#2 You truly need to know what you're buying. In tl;dr terms, you're buying a social hub, an apartment to hang out in, and, currently, four mini-games. You can also watch youtube videos. So, don't expect more than that and be patient as they rollout more updates. There's SOOOOOOOO much more to come. As I type this, we're eagerly awaiting an update that will add the Casino.\n\nThe only issues I've had are occassionlly I have to ctrl+alt+del that ♥♥♥♥♥ closed, a few toxic players (to be expected), and minor bugs here and there. If you insist on having a feature complete, bug-free game, then don't get this. If you're a Mormon or SJW, probably don't buy this... or just never play any online games... like ever. I guess play golf by yourself and decorate your condo by yourself lol?\n\ntl;dr = social hub with mini-games. It's good. Need decent PC and patience.

As an AZERTY user, this is a little problematic for me as I can not use in-game text chat properly because of this. They're working on this, though.\nUnless you're unable to get creative with its currently limited content, you should try it out.","April 13","true","15.6"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","16","19","3","0"

Tower Unite IS in early access as I currently write this which leads many to say it is "not worth buying right now." I argue that weather you buy it now or during later updates it is most definitely a must have if you're big into socializing and just having a nice place to unwind after a long day of work or play. Despite it being under construction the dev team works around the clock to bring quality content and beautiful visuals. The plans they have for the game down the road are amazing and I'm beyond excited to see them unfold.\n\nBoth the game play and social aspects are very diverse and very fun. Sometimes I think of Tower as an amusement park, or a playground. They provide us with the tools, and it's up to us the players to enjoy ourselves and encourage one another. The core of Towers players are amazing, passionate, diverse, friendly, and wonderful people. It's hard to play this game and not make a few new friends along the way.\n\nI have the utmost faith in Tower Unites developers to bring quality  content in the future. They're amazing hard working people who listen to community feedback and understand that respect and understanding are powerful tools to make a great community.\n\nTL ; DR : Early access or not, Tower Unite gets a 10/10\nThe game is fantastic and I know for a fact it will only get better as time go's on.","April 26","true","227.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonightmare/recommended/394690/","neonightmare","Ne0_Kn1ghT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonightmare/","332 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGreat game to play if you just want to chill and take a break from intense games like CS:GO.\nThe people at pixeltail games are some of the best devs in my opinion, when a problem is found they work hard to push out an update to fix issues. There are so many different things you can do and the devs are always working on new stuff. You can do to the cinema to watch youtube videos with other people, decorate your condo, buy tvs, couches, fireworks, you can go on a rollercoaster, ferries wheel.\nSome of the mini games already in the game are:\n\nBall Race:\nis a light hearted, physics based game. Your goal is to get to the end of mesmerizing levels as fast as you can. Speed past tricky obstacles and hazards such as bumpers, repellers, attractors, lasers, crushers, and more.\n\nMinigolf:\nis a relaxing game loosely based on its real life counterpart. Instead of turns, putt simultaneously in hopes of getting a hole-in-one.\nSit back and play with your friends on 18 hole courses while competing to get the lowest score.\n\nVirus:\nis a fast-paced cooperative and competitive first person shooter set in a dystopian sci-fi universe. At the start of each round, one player is randomly chosen to become The Infected. Everyone else is a Survivor and must avoid that player or they too will become infected.\nAs a Survivor, you must use your arsenal of weapons to keep the Infected at bay. Just don’t get too close, one touch and you’ve got the worst disease imaginable. It’s deadly, it can not be cured, and it’s coming straight for you. Run fast. Really fast.\n\nSome stuff being added in the future are: SDNL, Horror Hill, Accelerate, Zombie Massacre, little crusaders, casino, night club, 8 ball pool, laser tag, bowling, air hockey and so much more...\n\nAnd best of all the Devs have promised No Micro-transactions from the start, i know some devs promise this and break it but The pixeltail devs are different they aren't your usual money hungry devs these people care about the game and the community and are willing to listen to any feedback from the community.\n\nI hope that you give this game a try as this is something for everyone and Pixeltail Deserve your money as they will continue to care about the game and the people who play it.\n\n","May 23","true","15.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Advanst/recommended/394690/","Advanst","Frisk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Advanst/","259 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNOTE: This review is written based on private alpha experiences, and will most likely change as the game continues to take shape.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nGreat looking game with much more to come. Already tons of fun with lots to do in its early access state. I highly recommend it.\n\n10/10\n\nFull review\n\n~ Description ~\n\nTower Unite is a standalone version of the hit Garry's Mod custom gamemode GMod Tower, or more commonly mentioned as its shortened versions, GMTower and GMT. Tower Unite takes a unique spin on the idea of an MMO, and gives the player a bunch of activities, including playing games like Minigolf, Ball Race, and Virus. Playing any of these gives you the in-game currency of Units, with which you can buy all sorts of things, including cosmetics for your avatar, fireworks to launch in the plaza, or furniture for your condo.\n\n~ Activities ~\n\nHere's a quick rundown on what you can do in Tower Unite as of the most recent private alpha build: Play Minigolf, Ball Race, Virus, Planet Panic, decorate your condo, customize your avatar, and ride the ferris wheel. You used to be able to go bowling (kind of), but they removed the button that spawned the ball.\n\n~ Gamemodes ~\n\nHere I'll give a quick explanation of all the gamemodes that have been released so far.\n\nMinigolf\n\nNot much thought has to be put into this one. Everyone knows what Minigolf is. You hit the ball, try to get around the obstacles and into the hole in as few hits as possible.\n\nAs for courses, Waterhole and Garden (Previously Karafuru Gardens) makes a return, but most, if not all of the holes have been replaced with new ones, but the scenery is the same as before for both. There is a new hole though, named Altitude, which is placed in the sky, and makes good usage of very large turbines to assist your ball along and hold the course up.\n\nI will add that Minigolf in Tower Unite is FAR better than it was in GMTower, mainly because the Source engine just wasn't built to have minigolf played in it. The Minigolf in Tower Unite is a lot smoother and more accurate than Source ever was.\n\nBall Race\n\nSimilarly to Minigolf, everyone should know what this one is. Everyone is in a ball, and everyone races to be the first to get to the goal. Some levels here and there will take some slight cooperation, simply by requiring someone to go out of their way to hit a button that will open up the path.\n\nParadise makes a return, with all new stages. Memories is also around, with some classic stages and some new ones. Sky World is available too, except it's now under the name Nimbus. The odd one out of the group is a new world called Midori, which is far more difficult than the other three worlds, and requires more skill than knowledge of mechanics like how Memories would need.\n\nI'm a big fan of how subtly the physics changed in Tower Unite, and it's really nice how smoothly things control. The physics are definitely improved from GMTower.\n\nVirus\n\nAnother very popular gamemode, Virus is a survival PVP gamemode, where one person out of a team of humans becomes the single infected. All the humans have to do is wait out the timer and they win, but the infected is fast and has quite the amount of health, which can be whittled down to eventually kill the infected, respawning soon after.\n\nDue to my lack of experience with Virus in GMTower, I can't exactly say how different the maps are, but Hospital and Desertion are the returning maps for Virus.\n\nThe models and UI seem just a bit clunky right now, as well as some speed balancing between the infected and humans, but I'm sure things will be quickly smoothed out as feedback is given.\n\nPlanet Panic\n\nThis is a brand new gamemode, never seen before in any capacity in GMTower. It's essentially a team versus team game, where you try to get balls from a middle resevoir and drop them back at your base. You can hold a maximum of 4 at a time, and you can go to your enemy's base and steal their balls, as well as blow up opposing players. The team with the most balls in their pit when the clock runs down wins.\n\nI haven't gotten to play this one yet since there were so few people playing the private alpha, and you need at least 4 people to play it, but it looks like quite a bit of fun.\n\n~ Differences ~\n\nPeople migrating from GMTower to Tower Unite may be looking for differences between the two, and I'll share all of the notable differences so far...\n\nCONDO\nThe outside now expands past the pool into a beach area, complete with a little portion of ocean for you to swim in.\nThe garden (The purchasable part to the right when you walk in the door) now connects to the outside via a staircase.\nYou can change the texture of any section of wall/floor you want with a handful of original textures, such as bricks or marble.\nPLAZA\nThe inside of the tower's condo area has changed drastically, allowing for up to 80 condos be open at the same time.\nThere is a new portal entrance to a new game worlds area, from where you can queue for any of the gamemodes.\nThe casino has a slightly different layout for the interior. Slot machines work currently, and there's a room for the Spin2Win wheels, as well as big doors that I imagine will eventually lead to the duals area.\nThe nightclub is now down a flight of stairs. Other than that, the interior has not changed.\nThe theater has an almost entirely different interior look, including the lobby and halls to the theaters.\nThere are now 4 theaters, and what looks to be 4 private theaters.\nThe arcade now has an interior that you can walk around, housing some non-functioning arcade machines, Ski-Ball machines, and air hockey tables, as well as a counter where you would turn in your tickets for prizes.\nThere's a new store in place of Tower Outfitters called Rob's Imports.\nNext to this store is another new store called Upgrade, with the subtext "For all your gameworld needs", so I would assume this is where you will now buy your Ball Race balls and Slaughterday Night Live weapons.\nSongbirds has slightly different interior, along with Sweet Suite Furnishings.\nThere is no longer doors separating the store area and the boardwalk.\nBOARDWALK\nThe pool and waterslides are gone in favor of two new attractions and docks that houses the stand that sells you the fishing rod and bait. The shop is called Mcluckin's Bait Shop.\nThe first new boardwalk attraction is Bumper Cars. There's nothing but an arena and lobby interior.\nThe second new attraction is Poseidon, a huge rollercoaster with plenty of twists and the likes.\nTwo new stores, there's Fresh - Food and Smoothies which sells the blender and food ingredients for it. And there's also Celebrations, which sells everything season related (Halloween candy buckets, winter snowmen, presents, etc.), as well as fireworks and confetti.\nA new laser tag building, but there's no way inside.\nThe bowling building rounds off the end of the boardwalk. You can go inside, but the bowling isn't functional (as of the private alpha).\n~ Conclusion ~\n\nI think Tower Unite has shaped up to be (And will continue to be shaped) a great game so far, and we're not even halfway through all the gamemodes being available to play. If you don't have the money to get Tower Unite right now, or you're still skeptical I would suggest coming back and seeing how things have changed. There will be new items, activities, gamemodes, and all sorts of stuff in the coming months. I'm super hyped to see how Tower Unite will continue to improve and expand.","April 8","true","84.4"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","0"

I always enjoyed the idea of using a base hub to allow players a chance to goof around and enjoy virtual environments while waiting for a group to get online for a night of intense gaming. Unfortunately, the weird concept never took off and ended up sinking on the Sony ocean. I heard of this type of game before on PC without the game aspect and was overjoyed to see PixelTail Games taking a crack at it on Steam. Does this experience tower over the failed attempts in the past or simply weep in the shadow of the genre? I doubt it matters, because the real concern is if it can work better than PlayStation Home did.\n\nBefore I begin, I should disclose I was not part of the closed alpha build so I cannot compare the two versions (a couple of people I talked to have told me the alpha worked better than the current beta).\n\nTower Unite provides three main focuses: playing games to earn currency, a main terminal/marketplace to hangout with friends and buy items, and a condo you can personalize with furniture bought in the marketplace. Each part is still lacking in the content department, "coming soon" signs littering the marketplace with upcoming features. The condo does not contain a large variety of furniture and the four games available, while fleshed out, still need more maps (more games are coming). The marketplace has a movie theater currently open to allow players a chance to watch YouTube videos together and a couple of shops to provide accessories. I have observed people making their own entertainment though through role play, so it does serve it's purpose to act as a central hangout.\n\nThe bulk of the time is going to be spent in the games offered on the main menu as a means to earn currency. The four types are a zombie shooter, a ball race/obstacle course, mini golf and a ball capture game. Each game feels complete and handles well control wise. Each round is relatively short and provide rewards after each match/hole. There is a major issue with server assignments that will feed into a later point; there are no dedicated servers and a random player is selected to host each server. The amount of people playing each game type varies as well, with a good chunk of people focusing on mini golf while Planet Panic is left to rot from inactivity. The games are enjoyable though.\n\nNow to address the elephant in the room: frame rate and latency. The number one issue I generally see with Early Access falls into the optimization category and Tower Unite is no exception. Even with a 980 GTX Ti and wired connection I find myself fluctuating from 40 to 15 FPS with some massive drops into the single digits. Loading screen freezes are a regular beast to handle with the terminal being the worse offender. Crashes also rear their ugly head with the main menu opening normally only to shut down as soon as you select a feature. Latency from the games also make them an annoyance to play most of the time when other player's internet connections decide to cause stutters and slow down. These issues happen way to frequently to ignore and are to noticeable to be isolated incidents. All of the mentioned issues are apparent on lowest graphical settings as well.\n\nIt is taxing to overcome all of the performance issues knowing at the framework of this neat idea. I had a great time watching movie trailers in the theater or goofing around in mini golf with random players. The charm of a community style hangout is indeed underneath the surface, but it cannot overcome the stutters and laggy putters. I really hope sometime down the line this game will get some better safeguards to ensure smoother operation, but for now it is just safer to purchase a condo in another tower. Just make sure to pay the safety deposit.\n\nPros\n\n- Games are polished and enjoyable\n- Condo customization, while limited, is entertaining\n- Community is laid back with positive attitude\n\nCons\n\n- In need of serious optimization\n- Servers need stabilization\n- Crashes and loading screen freezes\n","April 19","false","4.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","12","16","4","0"

I even praised the game during the private alpha. But I want to make my decision, I really wish Valve added a "Mixed" opinion or a option to rate between stars, something like that. I don't have anything against Tower Unite, like I said, I praised it regardless of it's current condition, I've tested the game since Private Alpha, so this should be good enough to give my opinion on the game IN IT'S CURRENT STATE\n\nOver the time Tower Unite was released as a private alpha for backers who payed more than 15$ to the project, I was really hyped, I didn't expect the game to be the greatest during the private alpha. But during the private alpha, I was giving the devs the benefit of the doubt, saying that I'm sure they'll have this game polished and working before April 8th, and hey, I'm not saying they did nothing and the game is bad, I'm just saying they maybe should've given their self more time.\n\nI can't blame them for releasing the game still in it's early state, there wasn't alot of people playing the private alpha to post bugs left and right, so I feel that them bringing this game into Early Access was a great idea, regardless of it's early state, it would really help the devs out so then they can make this game even better.\n\nI wouldn't say it's as great as GMod Tower, but I wouldn't say it's worse than GMod Tower. It's missing a couple things here and there that'd make it just as great as GMod Tower, but there's still a ton of work to do before they can get to that. (In my opinion atleast.) I don't think this game deserves the positive rating it has, mainly cause of it's current condition, a mostly positive to mixed would've worked for me. The reviews I see mainly talk about how it's as great as GMT, but... I think they're completely missing the entire point of the review system.\n\nOverall; I'm saying that this game is pretty decent in it's current condition, but it's not that great to be given it's current positive review. I'm not saying that "Tower Unite is the worst, it's full of bugs and shouldn't have been released yet, go someone make GMod Tower". What I'm saying is, don't whiteknight the game, give the devs an actual opinion about the game, give them some suggestions and bug fixes to help the game out, these current reviews don't help them at all.\n\nNow, after rambling on for sometime (even knowing people probably wont read it and will downvote this cause they didn't read the review and it's a negative review), to get down to the final choice, is this game worth buying?\nI would say... Give the game a month, watch some videos on it and check out the forums, post some suggestions/bugs there so then you can help the game even more. Unless you're a fan of GMod Tower and want it now, go ahead and buy it, no one is stopping you, it's still playable in it's current condition and is pretty fun with friends or with randoms.\nIf you're still unsure about this, why not watch some videos and live streams about this?\n\nEither choice you make, wether it's buying the game or watching videos and posting on the forums, you'll be helping the game both ways.\n\n[insert friend yelling at me cause I whiteknighted the game a ♥♥♥♥♥on, fighting against his arguments, then he sees this]","April 12","false","41.1"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","36","61","6","21"

It is simply the perfect relaxation game. Tower Unite can only be described as a "Playing Games Simulator", and it's core concepts revolve around playing games and living in an awesome universe of friends and fellow gamers alike.\n\nIn Tower Unite, you are given the freedom to play a bunch of games, which range from first person shooters to minigolf to nintendo-esque teamplay. This is essentially your "job" in this world, and you are rewarded with $$$ for being good at games and playing.\n\nOn top of this, Pixeltail is an incredible team of hard-working artists and writers, and there is no other indie team I can think of that has as much talent and creativity as them. They are constantly thinking of new and creative things to add to TU that will make the game even more fantastic.\n\nAll-in-all, Tower Unite is an amazing experience and if you're a fan of playing video games with friends this is the first game I'd recommend.

The game may be in development as of now and there still may be bugs, but so far, I would say that it is going to become a great success. With all the creativity and inspiration from PixelTail's past successor, GM Tower, that ran on Source Engine, the community will sure be pleased with it. GM Tower was amazing as well as the memories I myself and others have made while enjoying my time there. I will never forget my favorite game, Source Karts, and will be looking forward to seeing something similar in the game modes to it as well. PixelTail, you've done great and I am rooting for you!

The team that have created Tower Unite, were also responcible for one of my absolute favourite Garry's mod gamemodes: Gmod Tower. Although TU (Tower Unite) isnt as functional as GMT (YET), its potential greatly outweighs its predecessor.\n\nThrough GMT, Pixeltail Games have created a large community of players, who have connected with eachother and shared many memories, now with the release of TU, i believe this community will grow and expand, making the game experience all the more better.\n\nWith a dedicated team of developers who care about their game, and a community that is happy to support and eager for what comes next, I can gladly say that my experiences on Tower Unite have been nothing but positive.\n\nI recommend highly recommend Tower Unite as a must buy game in the future, once it becomes more stable.\n\nFor now, Pixeltail Games (the creators) are working incredibly hard to sort out any bugs.

Now, I don’t mean the movement or the general interaction controls. What I mean is inventory, building, and some secondary functions. But as this game is just now coming out of it’s Alpha stages, all of this is expected, and in my opinion, isn’t very important (right now). However, I found it possible to navigate the world and it’s gamemode maps without issue as well as interact without having to jump over any obstacles.\n\nThe community is also one of my favorite aspects of this game. The people that have been apart of the GMod Tower community are some of the friendliest that I’ve ever met. Back in October, someone was giving game keys away for no reason. If free games aren’t a sign of a good community, I don’t know what is. With the players aside, the developer’s are also awesome. They often do Q&A’s on twitch and browse their forums a lot, responding to questions and helping out however they can.\n\nNow, Graphically, I think this game is pretty good looking. The main world, known as the lobby, is definitely a piece of eye candy. All of the maps look pretty well done and I don’t have any complaints. Now, the characters on the other hand, are obviously in the early stages of development. There’s not a whole lot of customization for your character at the moment other than changing the color scheme of their skin, clothing, and hair. However, I expect this to change dramatically as customization was always one of the biggest features in GMod Tower.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fun so far but I feel that it could be done better. The Golf gamemode, my favorite, is amazing and has improved from their mod. However, I feel that some of the maps/holes/rounds are too easy or just a waste of time. What I mean is that you hit the ball and regardless of the direction you hit it as well as how powerful you hit it, the result ends up being the same (give or take a few inches). Playing these holes once or twice is fine but when you repeat that menial process over and over again, expect it to be boring and frustrating.\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with the ball race gamemode. I imagine it would be fun if it weren’t so difficult. At first I just thought I was generally awful at it but after playing with other people and seeing that only maybe one in every eight of us actually completed the course, I started to believe that the courses were just too difficult. Other than that, it’s a gamemode with a lot of potential and I’m looking forward to see if they’ll leave it as it is or make it easier for casuals like myself.\nThe other two game modes that are available I haven’t played much of. Virus is one that I loved in GMod Tower though. Right now, Virus seems like it could use some work and polish but the core gameplay is there.\n\nThe Condo design is a nice feature. You can completely customize your own condo from something as simple as the chair you’ll sit on to the material of the walls and floors. Nearly every feature about it is changeable and I believe that you’ll even be able to change the floor-plan in the future.\n\nOverall, the game is turning out pretty well. It’s very obviously in it’s beta stages and needs a lot of work still but I can see a great game in the making with a lot of potential. I would definitely suggest it to anyone whether they’re looking to be overly competitive at mini-golf or they just want to watch youtube videos with some friends in the theatre or their condo.\n\n\nTL;DR: It’s good, man.","April 8","true","17.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The course design for mini golf is clever and well thought out. The ball race maps are fun as well with varying amounts of difficulty. Virus is a great "tag"-like game. Planet Panic is a bit rough but has potential.\nWhere this game shines is the social aspects. Whether or not you want to get into the community and socialize much, people make this game come alive. Whether it's watching someone try to play a mini golf hole for the first time or people flying off the course in Ball Race, there is never a dull moment. The game worlds have endless replay value due to no game ever being the same twice. There are always people to compete with.

Imagine PlayStation Home but not gone and with better mini-games and on Unreal Engine 4, also not roleplaying players, okay don't imagine PlayStation home. Imagine a game where you can walk around and talk to people or go to the casino and gamble with all your hearts desires or go to the night club and listen to music with people or go to the bowling alley and bowl with people or go to the stores to buy things, like pets, toys, Instruments or just things to customize you or your condo with and a condo is where you can throw parties or just have your friends over for movie night or anything really. In this game you can basically do anything. It’s got a home world it’s called the "Lobby" where everything I just mentioned is. In the Lobby there is a mini-game portal, shops, the casino, the night club, laser tag,  bowling, rollercoaster, fishing, and way too much for me to explain(some things may not be available yet) and then we got game-modes, where you can play mini-golf, ballrace (kind of like super monkey ball, PS, also my favorite game-mode since the dawn of time), Virus (that’s where the zombies and you get the weapons and stuff, I didn’t play virus that much don't judge me), accelerator ( (Not Released) Italian go karts wink wink) Little crusaders ( (Not released) little nights run around to defeat a dragon by stabbing it in the back and the dragon is a player as well), planet panic (I'm going to be honest I have no idea... something about cats and dogs I'm not sure) and a bunch of game-modes not yet released. I'm going to end it here. There is way too many things in this game that are worth buying it for and I would love to sit here all day typing them all but I'm going to go play Tower Unite now so.

It was first a Kickstarter and the developers didn't get enough funding they needed to create this game. Yet they didn't give up, instead they decided to try again on Indiegogo and in ONE MONTH they raised 147% of their funding goal.\n\nI've mentioned developers  because at these early stages in games, it is often the developers who make or break it. And in the case of Tower Unite, it's looking extremely likely that these developers are on the 'make' side of things. They've let us in and interacted with the customers throughout the creation of this game, whether it be making polls to see what features we'd like implemented, or providing feedback on our opinions; a lot of features the devs are working on have came from the voice of the community.\n\nWhilst this game is unfinished I'm still giving it a positive review as I think there is still more than enough content to warrant the price tag (including lots of game worlds, theatre, stores condo customization and more).\n\nIf you loved to play Garry's Mod Tower (which will be shutting), or if you're just looking for your own virtual world type of game, there's enough here to get your money's worth even though this is UNFINISHED.","April 8","true","56.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

GMod Tower dates back as early as 2008.\n\nThen with the support of their fans and dedication of themselves, PixelTail Games takes it a step further evolving their once small project into a completed fascinating virtual world - Tower Unite.\n\nTower Unite is built on the Unreal 4 Engine allowing for a larger lobby map without the performance cost, as well as shiny, intricate, new graphics compared to GMod Tower with its limitations on the Source Engine.\n\nMore gamemodes, items, and customization options will be added. Some spaces in the lobby will be redesigned tastefully, and other empty spaces filled in accordingly.\n\nYou will be able to create your own servers to play with friends only, or join other's hosted games. Since previously you could only join the few official public servers.\n\nOverall, this is the best party/social game on the market with a variety of gamemodes to play, and you get to choose whom you play them with.","April 8","true","5.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Maybe half of the features from GMod Tower are in the game day one, and the whole process is slow and unreliable.\n\nSo why have I recommended the game?\n\nFrankly, I applaud the devs for getting the game this far. Tower Unite was being made with a shoestring budget of 73k, meant to support 8 people for however long the dev cycle lasted. In this time, they were meant to:\n\n-Move their game running on the Source Engine using repurposed assets into Unreal Engine 4 with entirely new assets\n-Remake and repolish several minigames\n-Implement extensive home and player customization\n-Have this all stably run on dedicated servers\n\nIt's a mammoth task, and I can totally appreciate releasing the game this early in development. The product itself, right now, is in a poor state, but the foundation's there, and purchasing at this stage in the game will only make its updates come sooner and be of better quality.\n\nLoved GMod Tower, am ready to love Tower Unite.

Sure it was a shaky launch with server issues and crashes and all but they're mostly fixed now and considering AAA companies have the same issues, I think we can all forgive a group of 12 devs. I've watched their streams and played a good amount of Gmod Tower so I know they're going to improve upon and deliver on what people want. I backed this game with all the hope in the world and it's actually really good besides some of the technical issues. They are VERY active in feedback from the community and an ear is there for everybody who asks them questions via their website. Even right now however it's probably one of my favorite hubworld games out there, especially for 15 bucks (and I backed it for 30 on top of a copy for a friend). It has so much charm and individuality to it. It's a great way to make friends as well, I've already had a blast traveling from server to server and talking to people while maybe getting into some mischief together. The whole cycle of playing games to earn money to purchase items for yourself or your condo is addicting. The games they give you right off the bat are great too, Minigolf being my personal favorite. I think they did a really nice job bringing Gmod Tower over into it's own entity as a game, and I'm REALLY looking forward to what they bring later on.","April 10","true","29.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

This game is very buggey and its not well optimize if you dont wish to deal with this kind of content then thats fine come back when it gets better.\n\nTower unite is the successor to Gmod tower which was well recived from youtube and steam players. The game offered fun minigames a basic palce to chill and condos to work on giveing us a over all goal of wave your ♥♥♥♥ around the best. Now in tower unite we have the same goals earn units, buy stuff and last but not least become the ebst ♥♥♥♥ waver in your condos.\n\nYou can host Just your condos now so if you wunna chill and invite people over to hang out in your virtual pad you can go right ahead and the same goes for your friends.  Along with hosting your condo you can also host your on plaza which has stores and general entiertainment  for you to do in the basic form the game is in now, a lot of the extra content seems to be slated to relase in the summer time so if you want more come around later in the year.\n\nNow then you might want to  know what is the games like? Well Mini golf is simple you hit a ball along the coruse except thease arent jsut simple coruses they invole ridculous shots to cool long tracks.   Ball race is super monkey ball thats all I can say really. Virus is a first perosn shooter game where you and a group of friends trevel into a locaotin and few of you are infected so you and thest rest of your friends try to keep them back long enough. Then planet panic is like TF2 thats all I can guess since I crashed while playing it and got a overview of the map.\n\nOverall this game does need polish over all and is very rough, however do remember that this game is early access, now before you jump the gun and say "OH THIS GAME IS NEVER GUNNA BE FINISH LIKE ALL THE OTHER EARLY ACCESS GAMES" Well all I can really say is its the day after this grand release  and there is a update up for bug fixes.\n\n\n\ngame is 7/10 looking past problems that will be fixed in post","April 9","true","45.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattczar/recommended/394690/","mattczar","Sparksy Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattczar/","57 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTower Unite is a game where you play games with other people and get in-game currency (no microtransactions) to buy stuff to do stuff in the lobby. The main fun comes from doing stuff with other people, whether it be watching YouTube videos together in the theater, or playing minigolf, or partying in some guy's condo.\n\nAt the time I'm writing this review (day after release), servers are acting weirdly. I usually get about 100ms on a good server, and so does everyone else (100ms isn't a bad thing, it's just that I can go onto games like JC2MP with much more stuff going on and get much less latency). Problems usually have to do with UI (settings not saving, servers not showing). An update was released shortly after people reported problems, which makes me think that this game will have its issues solved sooner than later.\n\ntl;dr Tower Unite is a very fun  EARLY ACCESS  game.","April 9","true","20.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Myself and a few friends would be on GMT for hours having random parties and playing games, or I would close myself into the casino and happily play for hours on the video poker. A few years down the line, they announced Tower Unite, I immidately backed it on kickstarter and indigogo.\n\nAfter playing it for the first time today...\nSure, there may be a few crashes, a few glitches and a tad bit of lag. But this is certainly more playable than most games I've seen in early access. Do I regret backing it? Nope. Am I angry? Naah. Am I still gonna play it? I certainly bloody will be. Am I gonna get drunk? Damn straight I am.\n\nWith the amount work that the devs have put into GMT is amazing, the GUI is beautiful as is the overall graphics themselves. I can't wait to see the improvements and the additions that are just waiting around the corner.\nSome people may say it has been hit hard by the launch, but it can only get better from here.

Haven't explored all of it as of yet.\n\n(2.0) The theatre, while it does serve it's purpose, it seriously lacks the skip button that has been present in the theatre on GMT for years, and even, apparently, lack of any admin controls (i.e, skip the video regardless of votes), thanks to these glaring ommisions, trolls can now get away with either posting decade long youtube videos, or porn, and no one, not even any admin, has the power to stop them. Also, whenever I try to play a minigame from the lobby, I never manage to connect, I always have to go through the main menu (I seriously hope that for atleast the Pixeltail servers, the minigame servers become dedicated servers using the old GMT servers.).\n\nMINIGAMES\n\nOnly played Virus, and it feels just like the version in GMTower, bizarre inconsistency with hitboxes and everything.\n\n(2.0) Ball Race is there pretty much, though a little slippery compared to GMT's version, which makes quite tougher, especially with the hardest courses, maybe have the Unit payout increase on the harder maps to reward the better Ball Race players. Also, I get the feeling that for Planet Panic, Dogs can take advantage of the wide area behind the Cats team zone, on top of that, it desperately needs team scramble, especially for matchups with one team getting all but like 2 orbs.\n\nCONDO\n\nArea when it is blank looks like a direct port of Tower 2's condo layout, good news is that all the extra rooms are unlocked right off the bat in this version, although I do not see a vault, nor the moving boxes. Haven't done much because I haven't gotten round to buying anything yet.","April 9","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have no doubt that within given time that they'll be able to make a masterpiece. I stand behind backing the project before it was Early Access.\n\nEDIT:\nIt's the first day that I've played that isn't pre-early access. Me and two of my friends have all logged about 10 hours just in a single day. The game is addictive, even when the content is barren and with it's many issues!

This game is very buggey and its not well optimize if you dont wish to deal with this kind of content then thats fine come back when it gets better.\n\nTower unite is the successor to Gmod tower which was well recived from youtube and steam players. The game offered fun minigames a basic palce to chill and condos to work on giveing us a over all goal of wave your ♥♥♥♥ around the best. Now in tower unite we have the same goals earn units, buy stuff and last but not least become the ebst ♥♥♥♥ waver in your condos.\n\nYou can host Just your condos now so if you wunna chill and invite people over to hang out in your virtual pad you can go right ahead and the same goes for your friends.  Along with hosting your condo you can also host your on plaza which has stores and general entiertainment  for you to do in the basic form the game is in now, a lot of the extra content seems to be slated to relase in the summer time so if you want more come around later in the year.\n\nNow then you might want to  know what is the games like? Well Mini golf is simple you hit a ball along the coruse except thease arent jsut simple coruses they invole ridculous shots to cool long tracks.   Ball race is super monkey ball thats all I can say really. Virus is a first perosn shooter game where you and a group of friends trevel into a locaotin and few of you are infected so you and thest rest of your friends try to keep them back long enough. Then planet panic is like TF2 thats all I can guess since I crashed while playing it and got a overview of the map.\n\nOverall this game does need polish over all and is very rough, however do remember that this game is early access, now before you jump the gun and say "OH THIS GAME IS NEVER GUNNA BE FINISH LIKE ALL THE OTHER EARLY ACCESS GAMES" Well all I can really say is its the day after this grand release  and there is a update up for bug fixes.\n\n\n\ngame is 7/10 looking past problems that will be fixed in post","April 9","true","45.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

It is very clear that these guys keep their promises and consistantly deliver! I don't need to tell you that, you can just clearly see that just from the graphics and refined gamemodes. Jumping into my condo for the first time, I was very surprised with how much customisiablity there already was, functions such as: manipulation of textures and colours of surfaces and freely rotating and placing objects anywhere in any of the rooms stood out to me the most. However, I want to point out (the developers may already know this but just wanted to point it out), some surfaces did not allow me to customise and the back balcony floor appears to be using wall customisations instead of using floor textures. Current the condo customistation is kind of difficult for me (perhaps a 'build-mode' lock so that you don't have to hold Q).\n\nLike every alpha it has its bugs, I won't go on about them as the developers would alreay know what they are as the ones I've encountered are very common. However,  I want to suggest that they should add servers around the world, playing from Australia on American servers puts me at a very heavy disadvantage, models  keep jumping across the screen and sometimes controls are non-responsive. Ping peaks up to 500ms and the lowest I get is in the mid-300s. So far so good guys! I'd recommend this to my friends but would suggest them to buy it unless they are really dedicated or just wait until there is a dedicated Aussie server. I look foward to the content you have to offer in the future!\n\n\nSummary (For those who cbs reading):\nPros:\nGreat visuals\nRefined gameplay from Gmod Tower minigames\nMore planned minigames!\nCondo customisation\nSuggested improvements:\nDedicated servers in different regions across the world (Europe, Oceania)\nDedicated buildmode (buildmode lock key)","May 27","true","28.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it is in an early stage of development, it is being regularly updated by the devs, who are visibly working hard to create an excellent product by the end of its early access phase.  I'd definitely recommend the title, but unless you'd like to support the developers, I may suggest holding off on purchasing the game for a little while, at least until a bit more content has been added.\n\nFull Review:\n\nTower Unite is the spiritual successor to popular Garry's Mod gamemode GMod Tower, which unfortunately closed its doors on April 8, 2016.  The game was created as its own standalone product in order to break free from the limitations of the Source engine, which were very clearly hindering the developers.  Even though Tower is far from complete in its current state, it's clear that the devs are determined to create a fun and entertaining finished product able to be enjoyed by all, with the game being updated frequently.  I won't go too in-depth, but I'll give a quick overview.\n\nTower Unite is a virtual world game focused on social interaction.  The game's overworld features several shops, a theater, a nightclub, a casino, gamemode ports, a boardwalk, and of course the overlooming condo building.  Players are able to communicate through text/voice chat and customize their own personal condo.  Items for condo customization such as furniture and cosmetic items such as hats can be purchased via the shops by using currency acquired through playing various multiplayer games (accessed through the gamemode ports).  Each game is unique and features multiple maps to play on to keep things fresh.  Currency can also be acquired through gambling games in the casino such as poker and slots.\n\nSidenote: As of 4/9/16, gambling activities within Tower have not yet been implemented.\n\nI've only just scratched the surface here, as there is an impressive amount of content to explore in the world of Tower Unite (keeping in mind its current state in development) and more is undoubtedly on its way, but this should provide a pretty good idea of what to expect while the game is in early access.  If this sounds like your type of thing, I'd definitely recommend the title, though unless you want to support the developers, I may suggest holding off on purchasing for a little while, at least until a bit more content has been added.  Even so, Tower is a game that can be enjoyed for hours on end, so grab a few drinks, grab a few friends, and get ready to say "good-bye" to your spare time.","April 9","true","143.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everything we've seen so far got me excited to play, and I was ready to experience Gmod Tower with much more. Turns out, all the screenshots and video out there is everything we got. As of now, this game has hardly anything to offer. The character customization is minimal, there are only four games, and worst of all, the servers are a MESS. Condos seem to be the only finished feature. I understand this game is early access, but there's just not enough to satisfy. Gmod Tower should have been kept up until the end of early development. Keep in mind, this review will surely change in the future.

If you already donated for GMT, you have exclusive items coming your way in a month or two while they work on the transfers. For those who haven't played Gmod Tower, or not know anything about it, you might consider waiting a while for the Devs to iron out some of the bugs and other connectivity issues.\n\nBut heres a condensed list of features currently for Tower Unite.\n4 Minigames available: Minigolf (As the name implies.)\nBall Race (A version of Super Monkey Ball, roll yourself to the goal)\nPlanet Panic (New to Tower Unite, It's some kind of, capture the flag with a bunch of balls and floating saucers. Never really played it much)\nVirus (A glorified version of tag with contagious diseases and guns.)\n\nTower Plaza: The hub of Tower Unite. It has tons of shops to spend your Units at, and people to hang with. You can access Condos, Casino, Arcade, Gameports, and other places from here.\n\nCondos: Your personal home. Buy decorations from stores to decorate and personalize, and as features get added, you can host parties in your condo.\n\nJust about everything i said is listed above in the About This Game section. The Devs are working hard to clear up bugs while trying to work on new content. The main issue currently is connectivity on the Plaza and minigame servers, which they are working on constantly, and has gotten better since Early Access Release.

The menu is pretty great, considering its most likely done in UMG (judging by the default throbbing icon). The graphics also look pretty good (which is to be expected), and the VOIP is pretty amazing quality. There is however no proximity chat implemented yet, which I find ammusing, but others might find annoying.\n\nThe only real critizism I have right now is the fact that the game tends to crash every now and then with "Fatal error!" which I guess you could argue is a feature made to make the game feel more autenthic to the Garrys Mod experience. The loading times also need to be lowered, but then again loading screens are also a core Garry's Mod feature, so I can't really judge there.","April 11","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Since it is Early Acces Game I wasn't expecting anything fancy. It took me about 2 hours to get the game running and when i got it working eventually, then the server problems appeared. Now bear in mind that this game just got released so I'm not expecting everything to go perfect. Few tries to connect to server and i got in so no problem with that. Some people complain about performance issues and though I don't have a beast PC, I didn't have any problems with performance. Mayby those performance complainments are just people who can barely play GMTower.\n\nIn the tower most of the point of interests are still in development but in time the Tower will look amazing. There are so many new thing to do and when they come out I'm sure people will start to appreciate more the devs. For now there are few games to play and few stores where you can buy drinks or furnitures and that kind of stuff.

The graphics aren't bad and the music is really nice.\n\nMy main complaint is a lack of single player games. I found many games that needed 4 or 5 players, but the server I was on didn't have many people in at the time. I understand that the size of a player-base is not controlled by the developers, but I'd probably enjoy it more if there was some more single-player functionality other than customizing my condo. I'd also like to see another way to gain some in-game currency, besides playing games (links to previously stated issue).\n\nAlso, I'd prefer the games price to be a little less than what it. It's no big issue, it's not £40, like some games charge, but paying just over £10 for the game seems exessive for what it's got already, however I think it's in the right ball-park for when the game's officially released. I also think it would slightly increase the number of users who consider purchasing the game.\n\nBut overall, I can see a lot of potential. I'm excited to see what future versions have in store.","April 9","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stormalbnm/recommended/394690/","stormalbnm","Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stormalbnm/","47 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nLAST UPDATED: 4/20/16 (420)\n\nI'll be honest, the Early Access launch wasn't that great, the game hit into a lot of problems (and I bet a lot of people will agree)\n\nIn its current state, I would still recommend it, but maybe put it off for a bit and wait for some patches.\nHere are a couple of the main things that stood out to me. (and is probably helpful for you to know to)\n\nTHE BAD\nConnection issues are not very frequent but it happens once in a year\n\nThere are SOME setting saving issues (but they rarely happen)\n\nIf you have over 100 ping in Ball Race good luck, because I could barely play Nimbus (the "easiest" level in BR)\n\nA lot of things are still not ready, but in its early access state, it's okay.\n\n\nTHE GOOD\nGraphics are mindblowing Thanks to UE4 and the talented people at PixelTail, the game is looking spectacular! (but beware the low quality setting...)\n\nThe gameworlds are good They have great detail into them, they're well thought out (even though they're the same gameworlds from GMT) and it's clear the developers have poured everything they had into all the gameworlds!\n\nTower Unite is constantly expanding with its community if everything goes well (which I have high hopes for) PixelTail games will be continuing working on Tower Unite and adding new features!\n\nTower Unite is not just a port of GMT it's completely built from scratch, and there's even a new gamemode called Planet Panic (I haven't been able to try it 'cause no one wants to play it apparently) and the amount of work they've done in just under a year is INCREDIBLE! The code wasn't just ripped from GMT and slapped onto UE4, it has been revisited, polished, and overall spectacular!\n\nPerformance has increased from GMT! I used to have a lot of lag and many other problems with GMT, but that was Source's fault, PixelTail Games tried everything but they had limitations and Source was preventing things from happening. In Tower Unite, that restriction is basically gone! The networking (although a bit wonky) is working better than GMT (when a patch comes out, because right now, the EA launch wasn't spectacular)\n\nSource's age is starting to show. The Source engine isn't really optimized for newer systems and doesn't use a lot of your computer's strength, even my gaming pc couldn't handle a lot of the things happening in GMT. With UE4 and Tower Unite everything was smooth and working properly, and I didn't have many issues. This is the next big step.\n\nIt's fun. There's so many things to do, I just can't see why this isn't fun at all! Everything is going well and the developers are hard at work to create their dream game.\n\nTL;DRGMTower is gone. It's dead. (but we will always remember... 2009 - 2016) Tower Unite is in its place. If you love GMTower, you will worship, and sacrifice yourself for this game.\n\nMY RATING\n8.9/10\nFor Early Access","April 8","true","103.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I looked around Plaza, a lot of cool stuff in development, can't wait for it to come out! The games are cool but only 4 games but a lot of other games in development.\nThis game is a lot of fun with friends, but beware, right the the game is in Alpha Stage of development so expect bugs, i experienced some here and there and loading times can take a while and the game likes to freeze a lot (for me atleast)\nSo Don't instantly be like 'This game sucks, so buggy and unstable! REFUND!) Because oh boy, just wait a bit longer until the most common bugs and stuff are fixed, because i trust the devs of this game. I never played Gmod Tower but i saw videos of it and i liked it. This copy is a lot of fun!\nIf you want to have a good time with your friends, play games and earn money, decorate your 'crib' and have a party!\nThis game is for YOU!\n[NOTE] Yes this game is unstable and all, a lot of people won't buy because of that, but trust me, it is a cool game, and it will get even better once it is out of Alpha stage!

The developers are super amazing and constantly working to bring free updates to the game.

That being said you will also heavily enjoy this game if you are at all a fan of Garry's Mod, Habbo Hotel, or the very popular GMOD tower of which this game is actually a successor to, than you will lose yourself in this game.

I played it expecting to have s similar experience to what someone like GassyMexican could get from Mini Golf. However, the servers running the minigame are very far from perfect, with wait times so long that you automatically time out with a Triple Bogey without any chance to shoot despite an otherwise smooth gamemode, every server having a ping of 999 while it could have lower, and nothing very attention grabbing except for collecting virtual items. I will not fling too much problems to them because these guys do have experience from GMod Tower and to state that they aren't doing anything is just disrespectful. It's absurdly clear that they are trying to make this a reborn phoenix of GMod Tower with more freedom to do whatever you want as well as expanding their game modes to be fresher and funner than their older counterparts and that's very clear with both YouTube videos of seeing someone like SeaNanners and GoldGlove playing Mini Golf and comparing it to the older version of Mini Golf and by playing one of the tracks. This title has a lot of development, so I do not recommend buying it right now. However, I will recommend it because it does have so much potential to be just as great, or even greater, than GMod Tower and to play around in the minigames.","May 6","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Go around chat with friends you have a personal space you can customise the space oh, and unlike home you don't have to pay real money you earn in game money from the games with minni golf, a fun FPS called Virus, both of those game are addicting plus two others, and more to be added later.\n\n2 things that bring it down the bugs which are not bad, but can be anoying at times which can freeze you up, and  wish there was more customaztion with your avatar. otherwise 15 bucks makes it worth buying.\nWhen this game is fully done I think it will be way better than PS home, and a lot less money out your pocket as Home was a money vacum if you wanted the cool stuff.","May 20","true","103.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The updates are fairly frequent and actually focus on the important things that should be focused on this early on. Yes, there are bugs and crashes, but as you would expect of any early access game. The bugs/crashes are actually looked into and resolved shortly after. The devs actually listen to the community - heck if you check out their website for Tower Unite you'll see all the forums they have for bug reporting, suggestions, etc. The community is involved in the game's growth and not /just/ because the community paid for the game. It has potential to become even greater than what it already is just with what it already provides.\n\nThe games which are currently in Tower Unite are fun, and there is a lot of customization already!

What else is there to explain? Oh right.\n\nThe Game itself is polished quite well, considering it is a continuation of GMT - but it is massively better in terms of quality and latency. It doesn\'t yet have everything, but it\'s getting there.\nMost of the games run at solid 60 or higher fps (averages around 77) with Ball Race dropping it to the lowest at 12 fps on the GLXY map.\n\nIF you\'re wondering what Engine is used, it\'s Unreal Engine 4.

Let's get straight into it.\n\nEven though this review is positive, there are some negative aspects to the game, many people are complaining but before you buy this game you must understand that it is Early Access. As of writing this review there are only 4 gamemodes, and almost all minigames in the plaza are not functioning. This will however be added later on this month. Personally Golf is the most enjoyable and profiting gamemode in the game, but Virus and Ball race are also a lot of fun to play with friends. The condo already has advanced customization features and more will be added soon. Conclusion: It is a fun game to play with friends, and pretty good for an early access game.\n\nOnto the negative aspects of the game: Because of the early access state the game is in, it is lacking a lot features. The 4 gamemodes are fun but after a while they will probably become boring. There are some bugs such as not being able to shoot the ball in minigolf, and the reg in virus is pretty ♥♥♥♥. The game itself loads up pretty quickly I must say and for me it has only crashed 1 time, although this differs for everyone.\n\nTLDR: Is it worth the 15$? If you have friends to play with, yes. But the gamemodes might become boring.","April 20","true","26.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The anticipation has been making me rather inpatient and very excited as a user for me to own a copy. I use to play on Gmod Tower which was good and I was thrilled to see that they are making a standalone game which I think was a fantastic game.\n\nEven though this game is only in early access I should say a few things that you may expect to see at the moment during the games stage. I’ve seen around up 40 people on the same server and no more then that. Which is slightly annoying but I guess people want to wait until the out of early access when the game is more constructed, less buggy and adding a few tweaks that perhaps make big changes.\n\nNow I do find this game to be rather exciting and because of one word “Condos” Setting up your own place and making it unique is super fun! You're able to buy canvas and put up in your condo and then gather image links from the web and then you have it on your wall. The accessibility and huge amount of space to put things is a lot so you never get bored if you wanted to add anything else, have social gatherings, watch TV (Youtube) and I hope more gets added in the next few months or so.\n\nThe games part is very ambitious as there will be ALOT of minigames and places to explore in the plaza. But the main games will be in the arcade section which only a couple are available at the moment. BUT the one game I hate at the moment is Virus, it’s basically infected but quicker. Sometimes you’ll reach to a person which is a way to turn over to your side and even if you touch them sometimes you wouldn’t be able to turn them over to your team and end up getting shot. And one of maps has a good camping spot for the survivors which I find rather stupid and they are just getting free money for playing the game wrong.\n\n\nBut all-in-all… BUY THIS GAME!!","April 23","true","33.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

However, it is perfectly playable and enjoyable.

It's also really early in development and i haven't played for long at the time of reviewing but you can tell they have big plans to add a lot more to the game and i think it'll only get better from here.\n\nTower Unite is a great time wasting social game world/minigame collection and it would be even better in small groups of friends, but you can easily make a great small community of people on servers just like with any MMO","April 11","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","1"

Its an alpha, to be expected, please be cautious if you  fall under minimum spec. (Even as someone well above recommended spec, the lobby can drop as low 25 to 30, which compared to gmt is normal anyways, just be careful, if you can wait, do so)\n\nJoining games through a lobby still boots you after 5 mins of "waiting for host" This most likely wont be a thing in a few days, which brings me to the reason for that and the pros section.\n\n\nPROS (aka this is what you all want to hear about right?)\n\nBallrace is better than it ever was, looks, feels, plays better than GMT's offering.\n\nMinigolf is fun, but i ran into many issues playing with others (not being able to take a shot), solo was fine for me however, and was enjoyable.\n\nVirus is better than in gmt, it was one of my least fav modes in gmt but i can see it quickly rising up the ranks, it seems faster and the maps seem more fair. Hit detection for infecting someone still needs work, ive been on top of people our models touching my ping super low, and nope, they kill me, infection denied. Despite that, still a blast to play when the lobby fills up.\n\nSpeaking of the lobby its all there and then some, Your basics currently work, and what doesnt work is coming soon.\n\nAnd lastly the team who brought us this game. The rate at which bug fixes and patches are dropping is almost in-human. I dont think they sleep. Seriously how do they even push content and fixes out this fast? Your money is safe here folks, early access may have been run through the mud in the past year, but dont let that tag stop you from hitting "buy" The team behind this has been and is working at light speed to deliver on their promises, and theres a certain passion you can feel behind everything, that kind of feeling you usually only get from nintendo games. And that can only come from a team that cares. See you in the tower.","April 10","true","69.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grandnoodlelite/recommended/394690/","grandnoodlelite","GrandNoodleLite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grandnoodlelite/","147 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTower Unite is a nice change from stressful FPS & strategy games. I think of it as almost a Vacation simulator. If you get frustrated with a game or just want to relax after a stressful day, you can launch up Tower Unite and play some mini golf, do a Ball Race, customise your condo, watch YouTube videos with friends, etc. That's not to say that Tower Unite can't be exciting or intense at times. Ball Race and Virus are good examples of this. In Ball Race, you'll REALLY need to concentrate so you don't run off a cliff, and in Virus you need to stay alert so the infected don't sneak up on you. Tower Unite's got something for everyone.\n\nPros:Great Graphics. That's the Unreal 4 engine for ya.\nSomething for everyone. If you don't like one game, there are completely different ones to try out!\nFun mini games. All of the mini games you play to earn money are fun in their own way (this is obiously subjective, but I personally like all of them).\nCharacter customisation. You can buy hats & accessories to make your character unique. You can even change the color of your character to to have green skin, purple eyes, & red hair if you wanted to.\nCondo customisation. You can buy and place furniture in your condo wherever you want, and I do mean ANYWHERE. You can also change the color & tecture of your walls, floors, celings, and furniture. Want green brick walls? No problem! I was really amazed at the level of customisation options in the condo. You could spend hours making it your own.\nMedia players. You can buy TVs or go to the theater and watch youtube videos with your friends! How cool is that?\nUpdates. As more and more gamemodes are added and more bugs are fixed the game's just gonna get better.\n\nTemporary Cons (Cons that are going to get patched or fixed shortly):It's a pain to connect to lobby servers. Some say the server is full when it's not and some give me an error saying "Your connection to the host has been lost".\nNo way to ajust the mouse sensitivity or keybinds.\nNo AFK timer in Mini Golf. If someone is AFK, we have to wait till the timer runs out before we move to the next hole.\nUniversal Mic chat. You can sere someone through voice chat even if they are on the opposite side of the map. This is fine for the mini games, but not the lobby.\nNo way to stop joining a server. Once you start connecting to a server, you have to wait till you spawn in or get an error message to get back to the main menu.\n\nCons:Minor clipping issues. This is especially relevant in some of the Mini Golf maps (off the course) where some moving props clip through walls and rocks.\nThe map is HUGE. That might sound like a positive, untill you have to walk everywhere. The devs are puting in a monorail, which would help, but you still have to walk to everywhere. Having the jetpack doesn't help either.\nThe player customisation doen't have much debth in some areas. For instance, you're stuck with a male/female template, then you can change their colors and clothes. If you don't like their nose or hair, you're out of luck.\nThe media player only works with youtube videos. It doesn't work with any other site.\n\nIn Conclusion:In it's current state (Early Access Release), I'd say $15 is a fair price. However, once the devs get the Casino working and some more mini games like bowling, racing, and PvP it'll be a great deal! In other words, buy this game! Even if none of the bugs were fixed and they weren't adding any more gamemodes I'd still recommend this game for $15.","April 10","true","19.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A living, breathing alternate world where the only rules are Play, Create, and Party.

The Plaza is absolutely lively, the Tower itself is gargantuantly tall, the minigames are awesome and have an infinitely valuable replay factor, there's so much to buy, the condos can be incredibly well customized so that there are truly infinite combinations and permutations of decorations for everyone's condo.\n\nTU is one of the best social experiences since it went standalone from Garry's Mod Tower. It plays better, it looks better, and it hasn't lost any of the fun!

(about 40fps) (WHY!?)\n-The Condo, the condo looks beautiful and the lighting effects are great, but due tot his at day time it can cause my fps to drop to about 50.\n-video playback, when playing media on the devices in game unless i set it to 360p it would skip frames in the video, except in the theatre. that ran fine, probally my internet to be honest, just thought id mention it 360p doesnt matter to much anyway as the monitor ingame only takes up a small portion of your actual monitor.\n\nBy far one of the best communities, the gmod tower community was awesome, and so is this one, met so many freindly nice people already, simply good for even just socializing... without leaving your home.\n\nCons -\nQuite a few bugs, i've encountered quite alot of bugs in the minigolf minigame, although not as many everywhere else.\n\nother than lobby no dedicated servers, if you live faraway from the host then you're out of luck, i found this didnt effect the virus or minigolf games though as long as the ping was lower than 500\n\nRemove planet panic or fix it, i mean, it makes me sad, sad backward is das as in, das not good. (im not a comedian if you haven't guessed)\n\noverall if you're a gmod tower fan like i was, its a MUST buy, if you're new to this, maybe do some research, watch videos and make your own decision.\n\nbut as i say, if you are a gmod tower fan, get it right way, even in its current state, its very enjoyable.\n","June 3","true","30.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Tower Unite takes what was great about GMod Tower and brings it into it's own engine so that the developers weren't constrained by what GMod and the Source engine could do. Currently it's barebones, most of the very basic things work, with more things to come. The nice thing is that the developers so far have been quick to try to squash bugs, so development going into the future looks bright, which is important an Early Access title.

Likely, all of the main features will be out by September, from what I can tell, and the game is loads of fun thus far, even just a few days into the early access.

Its fun because you can play up to 16 players and the holes are sometimes easy but sometimes really hard and if you don't want to punch your wall, skip it :D\n\nBall Race:\nI guess the easiest way to get ingame money but also probably the hardest if you play it for the first time. At first youll think "WTF HOW FAST DID THEY GET THROUGH THIS MAP" but then after a few times or a few hours in my case you'll even be the first and you'll think "damn how slow are they" xD\n\nPlanet Panic:\nSadly the only one I dont like because if you're unlucky then youll play 1v4. Sadly also there are no people who want to play it so there are barely any Servers to join.\nBesides that you're sitting in a U.F.O as a dog or cat and you have to get balls (max 4 at once) which you have to bring to your base to drop and so on. You can shoot at the enemys to kill them but you and them will respawn. So yeah.\n\nVirus:\nThats the most epic mix of Zombie Shooter per round mix BLAH xD whatever. Basically you join in a random space as a Human, have some different weapons to choose (favourite is plasma rifle :D ) and then you have to shoot at another person who randomly spawns as a infected. Youll get lots of money if you survive with 2 others but thats basically it.\n\n\nThats all. Its a great game, still in early access with still lots of bugs but I guess theyll fix it soon!\n\nBuy it.

You then use the currency to get anything in the game, like clothes, furniture for your condo, or maybe a pet melon to follow you around. There's no microtransactions, and any way of progressing is a ton of fun!\n\nMy favorite thing about this game is the casual environment the players have towards the game. It rarely gets serious or toxic, and everybody has a blast playing whatever games they want. Checking out people's condos and their dakimakuras is fun too (yes there are dakimakuras, don't judge).\n\nThis is a game that desperately needs more players, even if it's just big enough to have a small party on demand whenever you want. Be warned that it's still in early access, and has a lot of features that have yet to be implemented, but it's still very much worth it for the time you'll have (and spend).","May 10","true","32.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Lots of games aren't working because the devs haven't finished the games.\n\nLots of items do not work, or are buggy. Most hilariously is the size changing potions, which can make you clip through the map and fall into the abyss if you switch between the potions incorrectly. The game is currently a glitchy mess so if I were to go through all of them here, it'd be several paragraphs.\n\nOne thing that isn't a glitch and more of poor networking is hosting for the minigames. Rather have dedicated servers for the minigames, the minigames make someone in the game actually host the game. Every game I've been connected to has an unacceptable amount of ping, which really affects games like Ball Race where the littlest mistake can cost you the  level. I thought "Okay, so I'll host these things instead". I had the same amount of issues with hosting with my friends, who live pretty close to me. I have an average of 80 megabytes of upload and download, and this sort of thing shouldn't be happening. Why can't we have dedicated game servers instead?\n\nIgnoring the glitches and all the stuff that is not in the game yet, the unreal 4 engine is garbage. Looks pretty for sure but otherwise it's a downgrade from the source engine which is about 14 years old by now.\n\nAs of right now, I feel that leaving GMod Tower and the Source engine behind was a mistake.  I hope the developers prove me wrong eventually.","April 21","false","21.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","6","12","3","0"

The devs made some bad choices like not even implement a mouse sensetivity ( there is a setting for it now!) at launch of the game  , even though it has a FPS part with Virus. It is missing basic things like a sort option on the Servers, a password option for own hosted games and no ping display on the game minigame browser. Also Virus has some problems. For example there is no way of seeing if you hit or not. No Damage display , blood or hitmarker. Most of the servers in the EU are empty. I think this game is too unfinished to be released as an open beta and taking down Gmod tower so early  was a false decision , because TU is not ready to replace and enhance GMT. If these issues are out of the way I am willing to give a posivite Review!","April 12","false","47.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","10","21","4","4"

I expected an improved version of GMT, what I got was a glitchy, terrible port where the framrate drops if you so much as walk. I got a message in the beginning of the game that this game was going to be glitchy as it was in early access, but the game isn't even playable. So my advice? Wait for the optimizations, then buy the game.","April 9","false","0.7"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","9","19","4","0"

I can understand it is not optimized etc due to it being a very early release but I still think it should've stayed in access for the people that helped fund it.\n\nI'd love to buy this game again when much more features are out and has all its bug fixes. I see that the Dev Team are actively rolling out updates which is amazing but I've got to give it a negative rating until it improves.","April 13","false","0.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","6","13","4","0"

I get to be paid to play golf, then spend it on expensive luxuries in my beach-side condo. 10/10\n\nSeriously, though, Tower Unite is a fantastic game. It's buggy, it is somewhat unfinished, but the current state of the game is incredible considering that it is still in an Early Access alpha. The developers are incredibly dedicated. They don't seem to be like any other, as they are open and transparent, making the game experience that much easier. The developers answer questions on their Discord, and seem to update the game frequently to fix bugs and add new features and gameplay tweaks. And the game itself, is very fun. Several friends got the game with me, and we've had so much fun with the minigames. Whether we're playing Minigolf, Virus, Ball Race, Planet Panic, chilling in the amazingly customizable condos, watching dank memes in the theater, or listening to Mac's beautiful voice in the tutorial series, Tower Unite is worth every penny of the asking price.","April 16","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Having been a fan of the mini-games from GMod Tower, it's nice to see that they've made the transition from Source to U4 well.\nGraphically the game looks pretty good, and the 'Plaza' is very nicely detailed, with a lot to explore and see.\nThe developers have already released several patches a few days after release. It's brilliant to see that they are keen on bringing the game up to a high standard.\nCons     My main gripe with this game is how open everything is. Sure, it looks great; but in practice having a plaza region so large when approximately 100 players are in a server at a time, makes the game world feel empty and dull. The prime example of this openness however, is in the tower itself. Spanning multiple floors, the tower is just way too big to cater for 100 people. I mean, the game world is so vast in the first place that you'd be lucky to ever see five people inside the tower let alone 100. The 'Condo's are also tremendous in size, with each player also owning their own virtual ocean! I realise this is supposed to be a video game, but how you can have the sea literally on your doorstep when you are 20 floors above is just insane and breaks the immersion. Personally, the sea also removes the feeling of individually owning a condo rather than it seeming like you own the same one as every other player. The original GMod Tower rooms for example, were perfect. They were duplicates just like these now, but the lack of the sea and a large balcony made each room feel like it was unique and rightly belonged in an apartment block.\nLack of optimization. It doesn't run bad by any means, but it's not unusual to see the game crash way more frequently that I'd like. However, as discussed in the Pros section, the developers are constantly updating the game, so I can't imagine this being a problem for too long.\nCharacter customization needs a lot of work. Whether you choose the gender of male, female or milk carton, you will  look exactly like everyone else who's the same gender as you albeit for a different hair colour.\nLack of varying animations. E.g. No swimming animation.\nOverall, the game is definitely fun and has a lot to offer in terms of content, with many more mini games and zones planned in future updates. However, it's still going to need a bit more work before I can begin to recommend it to others.","April 11","false","33.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","6","14","3","0"

Alt+F4 boring.\n\nThere's not many gamemodes and very few maps for them, many things have been removed because of copyright (including gamemodes, that will be coming back), simple character customization, mini-golf, one of the most famous gamemodes, is sometimes bugged or doesn't make sense AND the game is terribly optimized.\n\nThe only positive side to this game, for me, Is the condo and how you can customize it. That's it.\n\n\nWant to support the developers? Buy it!

And to add to the frustration some of the game modes that I and others played (Such as PVP) are completely missing, (And yes I know that UCH could not return due to licensing issues) in conclusion do not pick this up YET, the game will get better eventually more game modes will appear character customization will be improved and other features will be added.","June 4","false","1.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","3"

Do not waste your money.\n\nI have two hours in the game. I've crashed to desktop twice, and had countless more freezes.\n\nAssuming you can get past the constant crashes and freezes, the game itself plays incredibly poorly. The most glaring issue is the fact that, despite having dedicated servers, a client is chosen seemingly completely at random to host each minigame. Because who needs logic, right? What this means is that you frequently have a latency well into the hundreds in games with absolutely no attempt at lag compensation. This is the reason the fanboy reviews only mention golf, it's the only game where latency is not important. Good luck trying to play virus, the first-person shooter minigame.\n\n","April 16","false","1.9"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","10","23","3","4"

Yes, I know it's Early Access. But that simply isn't an excuse.\n\nIt's incredibly hard to connect to ANY server. It will either say the server it full when it clearly isn't, or it will say "Lost connection to host." Along with that, I'm unable to connect to some gamemodes. It says "Waiting to connect to host." These are the main two huge problems keeping me from playing at the moment.\n\nOther small issues that I don't mind too much, but are still issues nonetheless, are lag spikes when pressing Escape, lag spikes when using the sliders when customizing appearance, and random lag spikes in game, I assume when loading a part of the map?\n\nAnyways, at the game's current state, I do not recommend. I will gladly update my review to "Would recommend" once some of this gets worked out, hopefully very soon. I really want to love Tower Unite, because I played a ♥♥♥♥ ton of Gmod Tower back in it's days, but I can't love Tower Unite as it is currently, and that's a shame. It just feels extremely empty, for lack of better words. I do agree strongly with a previous review I read stating that all the players are spread across the servers, making some of them have a very low population and some of them just plain out empty. To add on to that, people really have no need to even join the lobbies. They can just go straight into the minigames from the main menu. Also, the condos aren't connected to the lobby like they used to be. Not a huge fan of that at all. All in all, it feels empty because of these things.\n\n*EDIT #1*\n\nSo far, the only things that have been fixed are the server reporting being full when it isn't and some of the stuttering/lag spikes that I explained. This is a GREAT move in the right direction, but sadly I have to keep my review negative because I still can't connect to servers at all. I would also like to say that I misunderstood something about the condos being separated from the lobby. I now understand how they work, and I don't mind that aspect anymore.\n\n*EDIT #2*\n\nA lot has changed. There aren't really any more lag spikes. Can connect to servers easily. Only things keeping my review at negative as this point is the player spread across server thing and the thing where people really have no need to connect to the lobby. On top of that, there isn't a whole lot of content at the moment. So you can easily get bored. Once they add more stuff it'll be great, and this review will turn positive.","April 9","false","12.6"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","7","17","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EllieAvora/recommended/394690/","EllieAvora","EllieAvora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EllieAvora/","22 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI think this is the first time I'm ever going to write a bad review for a game. Normally I'm a very happy person when it comes to games that I purchased but this time around it was a game I ended up getting a refund for. I wanted to buy this game for the fact that it could have possibly replaced the virtual world that I play on a lot. I liked how there was a gaming aspect and the idea of it is perfect. It's how it goes about presenting itself that was disappointing. I was extremely excited for this game, extremely like I was fangirling all over it to try it. I was thinking in my head omg! Something to replace my other game I won't be spending close to $100 a month for all the perks and to live on that specific game happily. But for once I cannot say that this would have been the best choice and I honestly would rather pay the $100 a month for land and outfits etc on my other game and use my imagination.\n\nPros:\n-> Being able to customize pretty much everything in game (your character, home, when you play mini golf your golf ball.)\n-> Having the multiplayer feature so your not alone when playing the games\n-> The different types of minigames so there should be something for everyone to enjoy\n-> Being able to chat with different people inworld when playing games\n\nCons:\n-> No one chats even though it is extremely encouraged in this game\n-> It is hard to earn money to get the things you want you really have to work at it\n-> The graphics aren't the best when it comes to the characters and I would possibly repurchase the game if character customization was more fluid and had many more options it does have a good start though. I also understand the graphics was probably so the game could work on most computers for most people, but sometimes having those good graphics just make a game better. I'm a graphics buff but thats just me.\n-> The gameplay was kinda chopy on many games I played\n-> A lot of the different games lagged and were very hard to control because of this\n-> The only place you can really do what you want is your own condo\n\nWhat I feel would make this a great game:\n-> Add in a sandbox where people can create there own things\n-> Add a build mode so instead of the condo give people the option of land so players can build there own dream home and castle.\n-> Possibly the better graphics I know for me that would make it better but I'm not judging 100% on that\n-> Have a more fluid gameplay so fixing as much lag as you can would be nice\n-> Add a media option so players can listen to their own music while playing games so they don't have to keep there browser up with youtube just to listen to music they want, or spotify, or pandora, etc.\n-> With the media in the home and in the theater make it so that if you don't want to watch what is being streamed by someone else you can still be in the area but watch what you want to watch.\n-> Encourage more imaination and customization (You could do this in a number of ways but thats what makes a game a game it all starts with an idea and then becomes reality.)\n\nIf everything else is later added in the future I would definitely consider picking the game back up again but for now it's just not ready and it's not something I had complete fun with. I see a lot of opportunities for this game but the company has to take the leaps to get it to where the players want it to be. I hope my review somewhat was helpful and that the company takes the risks in continuing to improve. Altogether, they are taking risks and making something that a lot of people would get into and love it just needs more work. I understand it's in early access which is why I'm not judging this too harshly but yeah.","May 28","false","0.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

And his view-points and knowledge of it is serious, so don't downvote this for "OMG ITS JUST EARLY ACCESZ!!" or "BUT ITZ GUD GAEM!!!" reasons. This is not a good game, it has the potential to be. But it simply isn't.\n\nMinigolf is literally unplayable due to a bug that happens every time you shoot.\nVirus is almost unplayable because of the ping.\nThere's tons of connection problems, and ping problems.\nThere is severe lag almost everywhere you go.\nFrame drops constantly, regardless of my computer having 6 gigs of ram and a GTX 960m\nThe microphone quality is ♥♥♥♥ poor.\nA really empty game for a launch that's been well known for a year, and for a game that's been kickstarted.\nThe plaza is empty as all hell, there's not real use to spend your money.\nThere's barely any customization options.\nEveryone looks the same.\nIt feels like a prototype made by some obscure japanese company, more than a game.\n\n+There's a milk-carton race.\n\nGarrysmod tower was a better game.\n\nwhy did you have to ♥♥♥♥ing shut it down. Why.\n\nI miss the good days where everyone was friendly, looked unique. Had playermodels, and more. But why did you have to ♥♥♥♥ it up?\n\nMac, this is no-where near the time, and in the development cycle for a game to be in Early-Access. It's way too empty, and there's no real fun to any of the games due to the glaring problems.\n\nBeing in beta is no excuse to be a bad game. I have faith in you guys, especially MacDGuy. Don't dissapoint me. The day you gave me a starfox trophy is one of the happiest moments of my life. Please don't vanquish any of these potentially fun moments from me.\n\nYou guys hadn't even tried to focus on the new UCM gamemode. (I think the name's now clockwork knights or something.) It's arguably your biggest, and most favourite gamemode from everyone. I've seen people talk about it in almost every online valve game. But you included Minigolf, instead? This just makes me want to cry.\n\nThis game isn't worth your money (Yet.), wait a few years.\n\nThis picture should sum up my review. (Look at the Bug Reports Section.)\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/79f9f89f8473d837e14a9263613e19e6.png\n\nThis can sum up my review.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Css62HdLR9Y","April 9","false","12.3"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","41","11","27","4","0"

I recommend getting this game at a later date, maybe even when its not in Early Access.\n\nThe first problem i encountered with this game was the horrible graphics support it has for less powerful computers. I have a pretty bad laptop but it is able to run GTA V pretty well. When it comes to running Tower Unite, it is terrible. It can run on low graphics but it does look like poop. The game is really weird with its settings as if you have a semi-bad computer it will set the resolution scale to a low number, essentially making your game look like porridge.\n\nAfter a very long time working out what my computer could handle, i tried using my controller and was shocked at how slow the sensitivity is and ditched the controller immedietly (not to mention how the game doesn't tell you what the game controls are for controller). Using the mouse and keyboard for gameplay is the complete opposite as you can focus on anything because the mouse sensitivity is way to fast. I might be a dumbass but i can't find a mouse sensitivity slider anywhere in the settings, so thats another problem. So please if you don't have a good computer, you might want to wait until they can make the game playable for the less powerful computers.\n\nOther than these terrible problems with graphics and controls, I tried a couple mini games and checked out the condo that you are given and i like what im seeing. It's going in the right direction with the gameplay but for the love of donkey d!ck focus on the graphics problems please.\n\nHelp the unfortunate gamers out here devs!","April 11","false","4.7"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","11","1","9","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zensras/recommended/394690/","Zensras","Zensras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zensras/","418 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI made a extremely trollish review of this stating that Mac ported over the code from Gmod Tower.  I'm making a new one to give an honest review.\n\nLet's start by stating: This is an early access and this will review will change in time.  I can't suggest it at the current state it is in despite my love for Gmod Tower.\n\nIf you have never heard/played Gmod Tower,  It started out as a launch party for the steam version of Garry's mod then transformed into it's own thing in Garry's Mod.  Tower Unite still has the core basis of it. What you see is pretty much the same thing, but with a engine that has broken the past limitations PixelTail had with Source Engine.\n\n==== Minigames ====  (Negative/Postive)\nCurrently, We have up to four minigames in the current releaseas of this review.\n- Ball Race\n- Minigolf\n- Planet Panic\n- Virus\n\nBall Race is a clone of Monkey Ball, but with multiplayer.  You try to race to the end and win.   IF nobody makes it: You start the course over again and reapeat until someone gets in the hole.  I will say, the worlds are neat looking...however playing on them? entirely diffirent story.\nMinigolf is Minigolf\nPlanet Panic is something I have not been able to play as of yet. Will explain more later in this review.\nAnd finally, Virus is a game that plays similar to CSS Zombies.  You start with one zomie who must infect the survivors.  Survivors are given LIMITED amount of ammo and their weapons are semi-random each round.\n\n\nMy first complaint? Ball Race is impossible to beat on several worlds. Many people have moaned about it on the forums and ingame.  Several of these worlds revolve around MOVING PLATFORMS and timing.  The platforms are so thin you have to keep your ball steady on that platform.  some of these are ♥♥♥♥ing 4x4 tiny sqaures\n\nSecond complaint?  It has to do with virus:  Grouping = Impossible odds for Infected.  Infected do actually have a small speed diffirence to survivors.  I think it's around 0.5X as it's not noticable until you see it.\n\n\nConsidering this IS early access, I won't be surprised if Ball Race and Virus get balance changes in several weeks.  The only one I could enjoy is minigolf because I love minigolf.\n\n\n=== PLAYER CUSTOMIZATION ===  (Postive)\n\nAs it said on the tin: No mircotransactions for anything.  Most of the items can be earned by doing minigames for "units".   I honestly have not seen all the prices for the current items in right now, but i can say it's fair.\n\n--- end of current write --\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntldr: wait a month for the game to shine","April 9","false","4.3"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","11","1","9","2","0"

I'm very disappointed. The game controls are so confusing. It's hard to figure out how to move and enter/exit mini games. There are no tutorials, just controls setting which you can look at, but I find that half the time its doesn't work in the game. Multiple bugs to fix, for sure. I like the idea of earning currency to spend in your condo, but again, very confusing how to do so until you really start fiddling around. The servers crush or don't load oftan so you're better off creating your own. I really wanted to like this game, but it just falls short.

This game acts as a casual mmorpg that offers a plentiful amout of customisation to your character and your condo (Your own house where you can decorate and fill with the items you can buy in-game).\n\nThe way you can purchase these items are with in-game currency which you collect playing the various minigames on offer.\n\nThey are also adamament that there will be NO microtansactions and you pay for the standalone game at a very reasonable price.\n\nBefore I get into more detail about the game itself I would like to mention for a an early access build the game runs very smooth on my system (not to say that it shouldn't).  The game also has minimum requirements that can meet a very low end system and the people that could run Garry's Mod: Tower can run this.\n\nThe minigames are fairly solid but if you are new to Tower Unite or Garry's Mod: Tower then you may not know what to expect from this game.  Minigolf runs much better than GMOD:Tower as the previous version had very strange ball physics and people use to abuse the phsyics to land shots that would unnaturally ping off walls etc etc...\n\nVirus is also an old classic that runs smoother and has the basic game down to a tee without changing much.  Some of the textures are missiing but this isn't a final product.\n\nBall game is the most polished of the lot so far but can anly hope for more levels and to be even more perfected.\n\nI havent had much experience on the new game mode but honestly the one time I played it I didn't quite understand what was going on.  So maybe some in-game tutorials might be useful if trying to create new game ideas.\n\nOverall the early access version is only worth getting now if you enjoyed Garry's Mod Tower, otherwise hold on to your hard earned cashuntil a later release.  Definately pick this up if you want to see this game bloom into a beautiful gem in your Steam library.","April 11","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like games where you can chill with your friends, customize your house etc. Then Tower Unite is 100% for you. If you want to grind a wide variety of fun minigames to get tons of coins to fill your apartment to the rim with cardboard cut-outs of Obama, you can! This is Tower Unite, my dream game. I've been checking my email for the past couple months ever since I donated to this game. I first saw the gamemode, Gmod Tower, like 4 years ago. I instantly fell in love with the whole idea. When I saw the game trailer for Tower Unite, I couldn't stop rewatching is. In conclusion, Tower Unite is a great game with so much opprtunuity and is a very social game, go hang at the movies theaters, meet new people, gamble at the casino with other players, go have fun with your friends in the casino! There is so much I can say but this review is getting very long. You also have seen my expirence with the game and I'm just gonna say I don't plan to stop playing anytime soon.","April 12","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After hearing about Tower Unite last year I was so god damn hyped I just had to get it. From what I have played so far it's really enjoyable for an early access game and It's even better when you have your friends. There is a few bugs here and there but the Devs try and fix these issues asap. This game was also made with Unreal engine 4 so do expect fps drops, even I have them with a Asus Strix GTX 980 but I only ever notice these fps drops while on a high populated server in the plaza area.","April 12","true","56.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Believe it or not people are pretty relaxed and chilled out compared to other social games you might of played.  So many things to look forward to such as a casino, an aracade and bowling with many more games to come.  The roller coaster should be quite epic.

I watched the Server grow not from the start, but from a time that started my love for these developers. Pixel Tail Games spent over 6 years of their lives making one of the best mod's for Gmod for a time that is equivilent to 1/3 my life. If you don't call that dedication I don't know what to say. These guys are the real deal and if you think this game is one of the many early access games that are "completed" and thrown away in an update that destroyes the game you are horribly mistaken. Those 6 years they had pretty much been doing this for free besides the awesome donaters such as myself. I can't wait to watch this standalone grow to be bigger than the mod could ever be as I was one of the people who was on the forums telling them they needed to do this.

Something about playing mini games based on skill and knowledge that rewards me with ingame currency that I can spend on making a nice home is oddly satisfying.\n\nRight now the player population isn't that big but from the people that I have spoken to they have been very nice and accepting of every player.\n\nSo if you can get by the crashes, the fact that there might not be a certain gamemode with lots of people on it, the game only have 4 gamemodes and having a somewhat small population, why don't you come join us at the tower and support this game.\nI can assure you that the game blossum with your support.","April 12","true","77.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The new maps for the game mode are nice and the graphics are beautiful however the controls feel to overly sensitive i would be holding forward then press the back key and i would instantly go backwards at some points\n\noverall i would say, F.UCKING BUY THIS GAME I REALLY ENJOY WHAT IT HAS TO OFFER AND IT'S BETTER THAN S.HITTY SIMS AND IT HAD A LOT MORE TO OFFER FOR ONE PAYMENT OF $15\n\n*launches keyboard across the room*","April 8","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't encounter many bugs, unless it's minigolf, but the ones that I've seen so far are minor and only last a little bit. I'm very sure they'll optimize the game in the future though so I can finally play it in 1080p without any frame issues. Right now the game looks like it'll have a bright future ahead of it and I really hope the devs keep up the good work. I especially love that they talk to their community as well as stream what they're working on. I'm not the best at reviews, but I hope this helps.

The amount of game modes, even in early access, is amazing and the customisability is beyond what many would expect. I didn't play GMod Tower or any previous work by PixelTail and to be honest I only considered and backed this game because of one of the developers being Lifeless but I will honestly say i was a fool back then and after playing early access I can say that the different game modes have truly brought me into the overall package (plus I love customisability). Mini-golf and Virus would be my personal favourites from what I've played so far. I'll admit the social aspect doesn't draw me in much due to being anti-social but I will commend what the developers have done to make it a great experience. If you like playing games with your friends but also like variety in your games then this is certainly a game you and your friends should own.\n\nSecondly. Praise be to Lifeless.

The reward system is excellent and gives you a feeling of achievement, which some games lack in this day and age.\nYou may compare it to being free back at Garry's Mod, but in all honestly, you still had the option to purchase VIP (which was £10, or country equivelent) and the source engine restricts the amount of customization possible. With Tower Unite, PixelTail have brought the best bits from Gmod Tower and have amplified them into this beautifully looking game, which will frazzle your brain with excitement :)\n\nNOTE : -\n\nThe game is in Early Access, and at the time of writing this, it only has 4 playable gamemodes (Virus, Minigolf, Planet Panic and Ballrace). More games are planned, with functional items such as pets and RC cars and boats, but for now, the game is lacking content, and will come apparent after a few hours of playing.\n\nOverall: 7.1/10\n\nThe reason for the moderatly low score is because of the compatibilty, and the issues you have with crashes and servers, but other than that, get it!\n\n**EDIT 29/04/16**\n\nThe game has had many new updates, which focus on improvements with multiplayer, and also adding more functionability. Since I wrote this review a few weeks back, I can now say that mulitplayer is FUNCTIONAL but still has it's setbacks, but for me, it works 70% of the time. I have many friends whom I've met through Tower Unite from Asia, USA etc. Depending on where you are, you MAY possibly have problems connecting to servers. With me (I live in the UK) for instance, I have a decent connection on most servers, and it's playable. There are many old reviews stating 'you will have trouble connecting to games from the Plaza'. This is mildly true, but as far as I've experienced, it works well, and is coming nicely!\n\nOVERALL (EDIT):-\n\n8.1/10","April 9","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's like all game genres placed into one fun little world. It also has a small roleplay aspect which makes it more fun. This game has lots of potential as Gmod Tower can prove. I rate this game 4/5 so far. Would've been 5/5 however there are small bugs and glitches. It also is not very friendly to bad computers.

Do buy it they have alot planned for the next few months its already alot of fun in my personal opinion community is also VERY friendly.\n\n\nR.I.P. ~Gmod Tower You will always be missed.\n\nBut heres to a new world and experience in Tower Unite lets hope its even better of an experience then before!","April 11","true","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's still in a pretty early stage and you can definitly tell but there was never really a point where that mattered. You basically make money by playing mini games then you use that money to buy items for your condo. You can buy all sorts of things that are usuable like drums, a piano and even a TV that can actually stream you tube videos. As of right now there are only 4 base mini games. the first is mini golf which is my favourite out of the bunch. Second is ball race which is also fun sometimes. The third is not really that fun so it doesn't matter what it is. And last but certainly not least is virus which is also really fun. I found that this game was much more enjoyable with friends (especially on mini-golf). The game is supposed to be in Alpha by the end of July so It will have more content soon. I recommend this game to a point, but because of the lack of content I would say wait until it goes on sale unless you have friends you can play it with then buy it right now.","June 6","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
