"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0skulock/recommended/294140/","0skulock","Oskulock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0skulock/","988 products in account","In They Breathe, you play as a sad frog that dives into a lake and sees some rather horrific stuff.\n\nThis game could be simply described as "Art" and as art, it is rather hard to review. The game lasts about 30 minutes from start to finish, but plays out a lot like the old Atari games. Meaning, you do have some replay value.\n\nThe gameplay of the game is very simplistic, you move the frog in the water with your directional keys and press space to speed up momentarily. The game is set in different "layers" of levels in which enemies will spawn, and after defeating these said enemies you are moved to the next layer.\n\nMusic in They Breathe is ambient but beautiful and really fits in the underwater atmosphere of the game.\n\nI would like to say so much more about the game but by doing that i would risk spoiling some of the story it has in it, and that's something you certainly have to experience for yourselves.\n\nAlso, dont you just love the ":C" face the frog is making in the cover picture? So adorable!\n\nAll in all, They Breathe is a fun game and for the price of $2,00 is very much worth the purchase.\n\nIt should be also noted that the developers provided me with a review code, all thanks to them! \m/","May 23, 2014","true","1.5"," 117 of 134 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","117","134","0","2"

If you were to spend a dollar for every hour of entertainment, this game gives you exactly two hours, even with unlocking all the achievements (Meaning if that's how things worked, this game would be a fair price).  Does that make this game bad, No, of course not. This is one of those games where it's one and done and you are satisfied, for the most part. Yet you feel empty, you go back and do all the extras, somewhat more satisfied than you were before. However, this game has atmosphere, it's not horrifying. No, it's creepier, and it really captures how helpless you are as being the frog you are. The only logical thing you would do is swim to survive.\n\nPay Full Price?\n\nAgain allow me to explain why I'm going to say yes and no. If you do all the little extras I would say yes. If you are just going to play through it once, it's questionable. The questionable thing to do is to buy it full price because this is one of those games that are, short and sweet. It really depends on you, the buyer. Most people don't like paying $1.99 for 20-40 minute experience, but some do. If this game is 99 cents or below, it's a definite buy. Again, it still is dependable on you the buyer.\n\nSharing With Others\n\nJust like many other creepy horror games you want to share this game with your friends. Does this still apply for "They Breathe"? Yes, of course it does! Something so innocent such as a body of water seems too cute. Is it predictable what you find below the body of water, somewhat. However, it still has the creepy atmosphere that you are surviving as this frog in some sort of nightmare.\n\nGame Feel\n\nOne of the negative reviews here complain about the controls are clunky. However, I played with the keyboard just fine and was able to achieve a perfect game. However, everyone is not me. Remember you are frog underwater, the movement is slowed and almost like a light coating of ice. It feels to some extent realistic, but again I had no problem with the controls. *RAGE QUIT SPOILER* You will feel desperate and agitated when you attempt to save all the frogs, it's simply due to the fact that you have that icy movement and keyboards do not have perfect diagonal movement. I have not tried with a joystick of some sort. Despite the keyboard having not perfect diagonal movement, it's manageable.\n\nOverall Recommendation\n\nI would say yes to the full price, if you are going for a perfect game, sharing with others, or if you are going to play through it once, it is still satisfying. However, you might feel empty because of the amount you paid. If you do not want to pay a $1.99 simply wait for a sale. If you can't wait for a sale then buy at your own risk, but you most likely won't be disappointed. I myself enjoyed this game; it had a nice atmosphere and makes its debut short and sweet. If I had to give it a formal score, I would give it an 8/10.\n\nNotes\n\nI want to apologize that this review is not formatted. Yes, there is a "Formatting Help" button below the review box. Tried several times had trouble. If someone could help with the formatting I will take the time to format. *UPDATE* Formatting and revision will be done EVENTUALLY. My priorities aren't steam reviews right now. However, I do hope to find the time to get revision and formatting done. I would also like to apolgoize for it not being done yet.","October 23, 2014","true","2.1"," 79 of 84 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","79","84","3","3"

I had a bit of a guess from the title of the game but ended up quitting after a couple of minutes.  I then read one quite helpful review which gave an overview of the gameplay and played it again.\n\nIt's a dark, simplistic game with a cool hand-drawn artstyle.  I weirdly felt an affinity to my fellow frogs. If I didn't manage to save one I felt a little sad for him!\n\nIt will only take a short time to finish, twenty minutes or so, so weigh this up against the price you pay.

What does heroism have to do with a froggy horror game?\n\nHeroes are not always the biggest, the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, the most popular, or the cutest. A hero can be none of these.\n\nIn fact, a hero can be completely, utterly, helpless.\n\nPowerful weapons, shiny armor, fancy spells, even legends of exploits... these mean nothing to a frog, and to your knowledge, you are not the poisonous kind of amphibian.\n\nYou begin this journey out of mere curiosity. You continue out of survival.\n\nAs I played They Breathe, I honestly felt building wonder and terror as horror itself rose to meet me. Every wave was electrifying. I admit, I sweated. Some might say profusely. By the end, at the climax... fire ran through my body, threatening to paralyze me.\n\nBut do you even "win the day"? What does that even mean to a frog?\n\nThey Breathe is a purist distillation of what many other games hide, and lose, behind an advertised front of graphics, features, and voicework of all sorts. Here, you will not find much in "game content", reflected by the small download size and very small price.\n\nBut you will find a soulful, wordless look at the very heart of a hero, represented with the simplicity of a frog and the honesty of nature itself.\n\nIf you seek timelessness in your collection, They Breathe is a pearl of great price, sold for *scoffs in amazement* a 2 dollar bill.","April 11, 2015","true","2.9"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","28","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/294140/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","They Breathe is a strange game that can not be categorized into any genre. You play as a frog that jumps into a body of water. Not sure if it is a pond or what. Your goal is to save as many drowning frogs as you can by pushing them into air bubbles until they regain enough to swim away to the surface. I use the word goal lightly as it doesn't really matter if you save them or not. The two enemies is a cow like creature and a jellyfish which will consume you. If a jellyfish consumes a drowning frog it becomes much more powerful. You can defeat these enemies by either waiting until they run out of breath or guiding them into air bubbles. They get stronger and faster when they get a air bubble so it may be better to simply out maneuver them until they drown.\n\nEnvironments are cool and spooky looking the deeper down you go. The game itself actually has a creepy vibe to it which suits it perfectly considering all the animals you will see drown. The moody music you will hear throughout is pretty great too. There isn't really much to talk about this game as it is a very simple game and also about 20 minutes long. It's not an expensive game by any means but that may turn some people off. Not much to do other than dodge enemies and collect bubbles to stay alive. That does lead to some pretty cool moments where you have to decide if your own life is more valuable than the random drowning frog next to you. Even if you die though you will respawn in the last check point which will be just right before an enemy encounter.\n\nI don't really see the point of dragging this review out. This is a good and interesting game with a very memorable ending. The short length of the game is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand it keeps the simple gameplay from getting stale but on the other hand it is a 20 minute game. I do think this is a game worth experiencing but do expect an artsy type of game instead of a gameplay focused one.  It is certainly unique I'll give it that and  it's visually appealing. Though there is no real reason to replay it once you finish so be sure of what you are getting when you purchase this. Recommended to those that want a very short but memorable experience.","June 19, 2015","true","1.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekmet/recommended/294140/","kekmet","kekmet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kekmet/","501 products in account","Travel down into the depths of a flooded forest with your frog protagonist, competing with the forest's other inhabitants for the world's most precious resource. The game says this is oxygen- little bubbles of life floating up from the depths- but I think it may be something else entirely.\n\nWhat is that? Well, this is one of those games where knowing too much about the plot going in may very well make it not worth playing. They Breathe tells its story in twenty to thirty minutes, provides you with no quest markers. No on-screen hud, no explanations, no sonorous narrator lamenting your plight. It trusts you, the player, to find the story, at your own pace. For once this works, because the simple gameplay and single path leaves little room to get lost or distracted.\n\nDespite its short length, They Breathe nevertheless takes its time on its storyline, and obvious care was put into the crafting of this game. Gameplay is simple- you swim around collecting oxygen bubbles, facing one wave after another as you head deeper and deeper. You have access to a dash move and little else. The game doesn't tell you how to take down the predators you face in the forest, but your little frog is tough enough that you have some time to figure it out, and will respawn if you don't quite get it in time.\n\nThe graphics are again simple but lovely, colorful enough to catch your eye but still looking like something that has been submerged deep underwater, so not especially bright. The flooded forest doesn't look like a place you would want to spend an afternoon, but it looks the part. The actors onstage are simply but boldly drawn. The design of the land's predators is especially good. The music, meanwhile, is pure background music, but quite relaxing- it seems like the sort of thing you might leave running in the background when you're doing something else. In fact, I've been leaving the game running in the background while I've been writing the review for just that reason.\n\nThe game adds some replay value to its short length and simple gameplay with its achievements. Some of the achievements actually offer different ways to try and play the game, or give different ideas on how to take on enemies, none of them are especially grindy though some are difficult (or I am just horrible at games, which is also always true).\n\nSo, for the low price tag, I would recommend diving into this one. It may very well leave you breathless.","June 22, 2014","true","3.7"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

Something about their constantly pulsating fronds, that weird blend of plant and animal, just resonated with me on some primal level. I'd always thought if one touched me, I'd actually cry, so deep was my fear.\n\nThey Breathe brings that fear of unknown sea plants to life in a very real, horrifying way. There's something about the simplistic art style, the subtle sound effects and the way things drift past underwater which invokes the sense of something darker lurking, of an unknown purpose behind the weird creatures I observed as I played. It's an eerie, unsettling atmosphere, where it feels as if anything could jump at you, where creatures twist and mutate.\n\nEverything about They Breathe seems masterfully crafted to heighten those twin feelings of despair and mystery.\n\nDespair, in the superb animations of frogs flailing about, gasping for air, or struggling as tentacles slowly wrap around them.\n\nUnknown, in the gradual descent, uncovering new aspects of the ecosystem while the sounds of more horrors to come drift upwards from below.\n\nWhile the chilling reality behind the ecosystem of They Breathe became apparent to me rapidly, the game still stands out to me regardless. Despite being built around a simple twist, its mechanics and art mean that it can stand more than adequately on its own legs, condensing into 30 minutes what so many depictions of horror fail at in hours of screen time.\n\nThis is a game which not only confirms my childhood fears of polyps, but adds to them. This is a game which can inspire fear with a glimpse of swaying fronds off screen.

No harm, no foul on that front.\nThat said, reading the description and some of the steam reviews, I expected an eerie atmosphere, and I expected either some creepy, scary, unsettling denouement at the bottom of the pond, or some treehugger biosphere message. Or maybe something about harsh realities of survival in the natural world, for all I know. I didn't get either. I just gave a bunch of jellyfish the run around as I swam on down. Then, it ended.\nI guess my only take-away from this game is that if you stick a frog on a jellyfish, it looks like a cow.","December 29, 2014","false","0.6"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","24","38","4","1"

To survive you need to observe the creatures and experiment with how they interact with each other and with the environment. There's no real tutorial, no point system or power-ups. The only way to survive and progress is to further your understanding through play. The story is also developed through play, and by understanding how the creatures work you'll start to understand the story, without a single line of dialogue or text. The short length of around 30 minutes is perfect - every wave of enemies presents you with something new to overcome and understand, and not a minute is wasted.\n\nThe only real thing I feel is lacking is an options menu. There's no way to adjust the audio or resolution from within the game since there's no options menu. I also ran into a problem getting the game to work in fullscreen (the default mode). Starting the game would make my monitor go black for a second and then the game would minimize and every attempt to bring the game back up would result in the same thing happening. I ended up having to go into the Config.cfg file in the game's directory to set it to windowed mode, which fixed it.\n\nAside from some fairly minor technical stuff, the game is impressively and elegantly designed to reward play without any immersion-breaking gamey stuff. It's short and sweet and immensely satisfying to play.\n\nI made a video review if you're interested:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CVv65tXTNU","May 23, 2014","true","1.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Controls are very easy to grasp and leaves the player to figure out each section by themselves, like a puzzle almost, but with more deadly jellyfish than most puzzlers. The end "twist" has to do with a certain optical illusion, maybe you'll spot it before then, maybe not, but all I can say is that it's actually pretty ingenious and a touch morbid, especially if you find out seeing the scenery lying at the very bottom. Atmosphere is topnotch as are sound effects. As you descend further and further it becomes just that much more unsettling. I wouldn't call it a particularly difficult game, though there are a couple of sections that I died a fair number of times. While I believe a game should only be as long as needed, this game is really, really short. Most people should have no problems finishing this game in a casual sitdown in under half an hour, and that's including the times you'll die and restart sections. I know that a game like this would get very repetitive if it was very long, but for a game that you have to pay for there should be just a bit more content. As well-executed as it is, it's still a very basic, ultra-linear title with every section basically variations of outwitting the same few enemies and going down further into the abyss. It's a great concept and a fun enough game that's crying out to be expanded on.","June 20, 2014","true","1.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Despite no linear progression or anything intricate nor detailed, and absolutely no dialogue, it still manages to deliver a light backstory to the world and creatures that inspire intrigue and interest. I didn't understand the meaning of certain things and eventually realized that was an intentional design so that I would draw my own meaning or ideas from what was going on on screen, and while They Breathe is still ultimately a fairly shallow game, it's been left open well and probably offers enough to make it worth while.\n\nThe control design also deserves mention. While at first the controls feel too slow and unresponsive compared with other titles, they fit with the underwater theme and help lightly immerse the player to feel more like the struggling frog. The lack of direct tutorial or story elements (which were originally included) also really helps the discovery factor and immersion, making you feel more like the frog, slowly discovering just what's going on.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nThe main issue of contention with They Breathe is simply the length. The very low price offsets a lot of the potential pain of paying too much for too little, but it's still a game that essentially boils down to a 2D "platformer" with shallow gameplay and some light story elements. It has some nice elements like a pleasant art design and interesting artifacts, but the short length coupled with the lack of challenge unfortunately means that They Breathe is little more than mildly interesting, but then at the low price, maybe that's enough.\n\nRecommendations\nAvailable on Steam at just $1.99/£1.59/1.99€, They Breathe is a tepid recommendation. It doesn't offer anything great, nor unique, and isn't likely to have you play through more than once or twice, but for the short play time it will probably absorb you and make you at least raise an eyebrow. Simply put, if that justifies the price for you They Breathe is worth a buy.\n\n* There's a selection of information available at http://www.theworkingparts.com/beneaththesurface/ which explains some of the story elements, development process and more. The password is given upon completion, for those looking to check it before buying, the password is jelly\n* The soundtrack deserves special mention for being very sombre and pleasant. There's an interesting thread about it being made available here, with a link to the similar soundtrack for another game by the same team.","March 29","true","4.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

You play as a frog that must dive further and further into the unknown. The game locks you into a single screen, although you can leave the screen and an arrow will mark where you are. Why is this important? Because you are being chased and followed by jellyfish. Your only defense is the ability to dart through the water. The one button controls ensure this could have been played on an Atari joystick. Your only allies are air bubbles that you need for oxygen (health). It feels like an old school arcade game with updated atmospheric color penciled graphics.\n\nThere are a few types of jellyfish, those that have heads (making me think they were yaks swimming underwater) you will need to outlast, until they run out of oxygen. For every bubble that they catch, these jellyfish will dash at you, but you can dart out of the way. More typical jellyfish (headless) will burst if they hit enough air bubbles. You need to bait them to the air, but the longer they haven't bumped into anything, the faster they go. If they catch you, you'll be stuck inside them until a bubble hits them. So what's the danger then? When the headless jellyfish burst, their tentacles spring out damaging you and other frogs. You will also find green jellyfish that rapid fire what look like radioactive air bubbles at you. It almost turns into a bullet hell shooter for brief moments.\n\nOn your way down, you'll see frogs in trouble, in a panicked state looking for air. You'll need to bait them over to you for air or bump into them, sending them into air bubbles. Once they have enough air / health, they'll swim away out of danger.\n\nIn their panicked state, they can be caught by the 'headed' jellyfish and brought down into the abyss, where the jellyfish gets a supercharged, more aggressive dash. If you take too much damage from headed jellyfish, your green frog will start to turn brown and bleed. This is where oxygen comes into play. It is your health. If you haven't had oxygen, you will turn brown before you too end up in a panicked state.\n\nIf you are in a panicked state and get dragged down to the abyss, that's a game over and to the last checkpoint, which quickly loads.\n\nYou will quickly reach the bottom of the morbid pond within 20 minutes, uncovering the horrifying truth of what lies below. What has been causing the air bubbles. ... unless the game glitches and prevents the screen before the boss from panning down to the boss. After beating the game the first time and quickly replaying it, I ran into the glitch three times in a row. Luckily you can just recall the last wave (checkpoint).\n\nIn all of its glory, its a good game, but its just less than 30 minutes with old school gameplay that can be done on an Atari controller. Is it worth a playthrough, yes, but only if you like old school Atari gameplay and a creepy unconventional tone.","October 29, 2014","false","1.3"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","30","52","0","0"

Gameplay involves capturing oxygen bubbles to keep yourself alive, and also using those bubbles for some other things, but considering the length of the game I don't want to spoil any gameplay elements that are meant to be figured out by the player :)  This is a very short game (~30 min to play through), and pretty easy to finish with frequent checkpoints (although if you're an achievement hunter, you'll be quite challenged to get some of them).\n\nHowever, I don't think challenge is really the point of this game; it's more the atmosphere and the creepy secret you discover, and the gameplay is meant to add to just add to that feeling and not get in the way. While I wouldn't call this game "horror" like some other reviews, it is a bit unsettling at times. The slightly naive-looking art style fits the game well in this respect, although if you're a gamer who demands high production in art, sound, etc., this is not the game for you.\n\nThey Breathe is a strange little game that may lack polish, but uses what it does have to good effect.

After all, who makes a mystery – horror game about frogs and lives to tell the tale ?\n\nI have heard a lot of good things about this title. For instance that it started as a two-people school project – and in my opinion that is an important fact, since if a game like this was able to make it through the Greenlight, there must be something going on for it.\n\nThat ‘main’ feature is the game’s dark and creepy atmosphere. It needs to be said that ‘They Breathe’ is incredible at building the tension. The gameplay mechanics, sound and graphics may be simple, but still they do a perfect job of creating a completely unsettling experience. Furthermore, I believe that ‘They Breathe’ looks much better ingame than it does on the screenshots.\n\nStill it needs to be said that this game can be completed in below 30 minutes.  And this information is important for more reasons than the sheer gameplay length. First of all: the major component of every good horror story is the mystery. While ‘They Breathe’ deliver a strong (although a bit disappointing) reveal, after said 30 minutes there is nothing more to keep one playing with the exception of these few achievements that can be unlocked. Furthermore, it can be argued that such a short experience isn’t enough to build as much tension as it was in the case of games like Penumbra or (the early instalments of) Silent Hill which kept the player at the edge of the seat for many long and horrifying hours.\n\nTo summarize: While I don’t necessarily believe that charging 2 euros for 30 minutes of gameplay is an entirely fair practice and there are plenty of creepy freeware games out there (say, suteF, SCP Containment Breach, Yume Nikki and many, many more…) I would still recommend buying ‘They Breathe’ as an investment in a promising indie developer. And then, maybe one day we will be able to play a longer and more complex game titled, for example, ‘They Don’t Breathe Any More’.\n\n***\n\n\n‘They Breathe’ to interesująca mała gierka. Bo niby jakie inne studio dotąd zrobiło grę – horror o żabach i żyło na tyle długo żeby o tym opowiadać ?\n\nZanim zagrałem, słyszałem o tej grze dużo dobrego. Na przykład że powstała jako szkolny projekt dwóch ludzi co w mojej opinii jest dobrą informacją:  jeżeli tego typu gra jest w stanie przebić się przez Steamowego Greenlight’a, musi mieć w sobie ‘to coś’.\n\nGłówną ‘atrakcją’ gry jest bez wątpienia jej ciężka atmosfera. Trzeba przyznać że ‘They Breathe’ potrafi budować napięcie lepiej niż niejedna gra z segmentu AAA. Mechanika gry, dźwięk i grafika, mimo iż minimalistyczne, świetnie spisują się w budowaniu niepokojącego doświadczenia. Co więcej, gra wygląda dużo lepiej ‘w akcji’ niż na zrzutach ekranu.\n\nMimo dobrego wrażenia jakie gra sprawia trzeba powiedzieć jedno: ‘They Breathe’ można ukończyć w czasie krótszym niż 30 minut. To ważna informacja nie tylko ze względu na krótki czas ‘zabawy’ jaki gra oferuje. Po pierwsze: to co napędza każdy horror to tajemnica. Zakończenie ‘They Breathe’ jest mocne (może tylko odrobinkę zawodzi) – tyle że po 30 minutach nie ma już nic co trzymało by gracza przed ekranem. Może poza tymi kilkoma achivementami które pozostały do zdobycia. Co więcej, 30 minut to zbyt mało aby zbudować atmosferę – w porównaniu taka Penumbra czy (wczesne części) Silent Hill przerażały przez długie godziny.\n\nSumując: Mimo że 2 euro za 30 minut gry może nie wydawać się do końca uczciwą ceną, a w Internecie pełno jest darmowych horrorów (patrz: suteF, SCP Containment Breach, Yume Nikki i wiele innych…), rekomenduję  ‘They Breathe’ jako inwestycję w dobrze zapowiadającego się niezależnego developera. Może kiedyś pozwolą nam zagrać w coś dłuższego i lepiej dopracowanego?

Which it is pretty much all it's about.\n\nThe point of the game is exploring what is happening, so don’t watch videos or too many screens before playing. It’s only about 20-30 min long game, so even small videos can spoil it, and as it’s about the exploration it might not have that much replay value, but it might be worth playing twice or so.\n\nFor such small price tag (equal to a snack or so) I would recommend it to anyone if you are interested in indie games that are a bit different or if you are in for a short game with good atmosphere.","May 26, 2014","true","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It certainly makes an argument for games as experiences rather than mindless, graphics-focused fodder.\n\nGameplay had a nostalgic, almost retro feel (this is a good thing) - tight, simplistic controls, with thoughtful, challenging level design. Nothing is spoonfed, leaving it up to the player to deduce how to proceed as each adversary presents itself.\n\nThe atmosphere is fantastic, utilizing excellent sound design and unnerving imagery to produce an almost suffocating, dark tension. Even without an obvious storyline present, the game clearly communicates that the protagonist's objective is much more dire and grave than we're initially led to believe from the title screen.\n\nI highly recommend this - $2 is an absolute steal for this surprisingly deep, beautiful work.","May 31, 2014","true","0.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Not just in the reviews here on Steam, but also within the tag-lines from reviews that are included in the store page description for this game. They talk about how artistically horrific this title is, and with a hipster sheen to their typed words, they seem to attempt to find a deeper meaning to the game than what is really there.\n\nLet me put it for you plain and simple. They Breathe is a 2D down-scrolling game where you control a frog, avoid jellyfish, save other frogs and collect oxygen bubbles for 20-30 minutes. If you're good enough, you'll save all of your froggy friends and maybe complete the game without dying at some point. That's all there is to it.\n\nThis game isn't "chilling", this game isn't "the scariest game on earth", this game isn't "scarring". At best, this game is mediocre and mildly creepy for the most fleeting of moments. I'm not sure if the hype surrounding it is an exaggerated joke or not.

Its playtime is rather short  and at its core its a very simple game, but that doesn’t stop They Breathe down from being dark, captivating, and mysterious the whole way through. The game starts off innocent enough, you dive into the water and simply have to collect some bubbles to stay alive. Then you come across other frogs who too are fighting for a share of the precious resource. Rather you lend them a hand in getting a taste of the air or let them suffocate and drown to the depths below only for an enemy to take their place is up to you, though overall it doesn't have any real consequence on you as oxygen is plentiful which is sort of disappointing in itself. Though as you continue your descent you start encountering other, creepier cow-like creatures that without warning began to attack you and drag your froggy friends into the darkness under you.\n\nHere is where the ultimate fight for survival begins as you continue your descent into the lake below and struggle to stay alive as every hit against you slowly kills you. The sudden change from relaxing to terrifying is intriguing, as the creepiness of the situation in front of you is what drives you to continue going down and to continue fighting just to see what’s at the bottom of the lake... for better or for worse. The atmosphere in They Breathe is spot on with the disturbing feel I always expect in horror games. The minimal music that plays behind the sounds of crashing, your movement, and the noises of the others all- unsettling and the dark colors in the art really fits the atmosphere perfectly.\n\nMy minor annoyance with how little effect saving or killing the frogs has on your play through aside, They Breathe is an interesting and scary experience that only lasts for about half an hour, but achieves so much in that short window of time that it makes the overall chance of experiencing it worth it all.\n\nAnswer: Yes","December 10, 2014","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","5"

The underlying irony and cruelty in the game really got me, but it was neverless an enjoyable play. I would definately reccomend this game.\n\nThe music was excellent.  It was a very low, abianient style that had me connect with the game on a deeper level rather than just in-my-face loudness.  Although the game did not have a huge variety of tracks and the tracks themselves were rather simple, this made it all the more enoyable to play along with.\n\nGameplay was also fairly great.  The controls were simple and relatively easy to master and later on this was tested, which made the game much better.  Parts of the gameplay were hard to grasp at first, like saving the frogs and the jellyfish stuff, which you needed to grasp fast or else you would restart the wave.  The waves system was also an enjoyable part of the gameplay that made sense in context with the story.\n\nFinally, the story.  It's pretty simple, you can basiclly read the game discription and you won't get too much more storywise from playing the game.  The twists and turns of the game and the game's exploition of this, however, made the simple story of a frog's "there and back" more intresting and exciting.\n\nOverall, I would reccomend this game to someone who enjoys simple, not blatently violent games with an indie touch to it.  Once you complete it you basically never need to play it again but in my case I enjoyed playing this several more times and explored different stratagies of winning and achivement hunting.  Definately an enjoyable play, 4.5 out 5 only because of the possibility of making it longer might have, in my opinion, made it better.","August 25, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

From its saccharine looking main screen you may be deceived into thinking that this isn't a horror game, but that soon changes as you delve deep into the pond you are forced to explore. When you realize the true reality of the protagonist's new environment and the enemies you encounter, you are left with a deep seated uneasiness.

At first I thought to myself, "Cows?! What in the world are cows doing in a place like this?" Then a couple of segments down, I then realize how these "cows" were made. That revelation, to me, was horrific. Mind you, it wasn't scary, but it was indeed disturbingly horrific.\n\nA+ on the story-telling. As you play, if you take notice of the enemies and the background, you start to unravel some clues as to why, what & how. Just a fair warning though, this game is extremely short but for a 61cent trip, it was well worth it.\n\nI love the ambience and the art style very much. It speaks, well... horrors! The game-play is actually a puzzle type where you have to figure out the best way to defeat the enemies (Megaman bosses, anyone?). Nobody tells you what to do and that makes it even better.\n\nI would have liked it even more if it was longer or if there was some kind of new game + or difficulty upgrade somehow.

I do not recommend the game.I can imagine if you were in the right mood to be creeped out this would make an exellent purchase, but it didn't work for me at the time. The story isn't all that 'horrifying' but more along the lines of 'maybe creepy?;.\nThe game has nice music and good horror creatures. Unfortunately, while the creatures would very work well in a Hollywood film, the games main horror is based off something the game's founder realised when his colleague was drawing on a napkin (true story).\nThe gameplay...is a bit eh. "the game leaves it up to you to figure out every part of its increasingly bizarre universe" This part of the gameplay is alright except the game feels more centered towards the story. The controls are good but the actual things you need to do are a bit annoying, it feels like trying to keep a balloon in the air while moving your hands with WASD.\n\nPros:\n-Somewhat creepy story\n-The art is alright but only actually serves to pull off the plot twist\n-The musical ambience is very well made\n-Tight controls\n-Nice end scene (gameplay, not cinematic)\n-Cheap\n\nCons:\n-Not really that horrifying\n-30 minutes long\n-No replay value (unless this is the only game you own that you like)\n-Annoying gameplay at points\n-The game came off a napkin.

Some of the waves were frustrating; and considering that this is a dark game, there was nothing to explain what was happening. That left me wanting a lot of answers and explanations that will never be, it seems.\n\nI really tried to like this game because for the most part I *love* when indie studios try something truly unique. Games like "Journey", "Flower", and "The Unfinished Swan" are some of my favorite games on the PlayStation because they're so different from most games and I played through all of them several times. Conversely, I was glad when "They Breathe" was finished not because of a sense of satisfaction but rather because I just wanted to be done with the game. If you've ever read through a book that was not enjoyable but you *had* to see it all the way through even if the end couldn't come soon enough, then you understand my feelings for this game.\n\nOn the other hand, it's only $2. I've spent more money on worse things, so your mileage on whether it's worth that or not might vary. And I'd rather have money go to an indie developer who's at least TRYING something differen than to megacorp with "Same Sports As Last Year 20xx", so I don't regret paying for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jammerlee/recommended/294140/","jammerlee","Jammerlee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jammerlee/","670 products in account","What an odd and somewhat surreal game. I found it looking through a list of summer sales, the silly looking banner grabbing my attention. When I noticed it was only something like $0.60 I thought, "Why the heck not". Honestly, I got what I paid for - whatever you decide on whether or not to get this at the end of this review, don't pay the $2. That may not sound like much money, but this game is not worth full price.\n\nAnyway, it's.. well, I wouldn't necessarily call it good, but it's oddly kind of zen? The controls are clunky (I used a 360 controller, I wouldn't recommend the keyboard) and often frustraing to handle, and the game basically just throws you in with no explanation. In a modern age spoiled by tutorials, it was an odd feeling flailing about trying to figure out the controls and how to deal with the enemies. The game only takes about 20-30 minutes or so to play (unless you're a completionist like me trying to go the extra miles for achievements) and is a series of waves where you have to defeat the enemies and save other frogs (assuming the enemies don't kill them first). Your health is gauged by how much breath you have, breathing air bubbles or the last gasps of air from enemies. There's no meter for this, instead the frog changes color and starts to spit bloodied bubbles to indicate its slowly drowning. Graphically I personally felt it looked somewhat juvenile, what may have been the point, though the frog sprites in particular weirded me out over the fact it looks like a double amputee missing its front legs. The music I felt was the best part. It's very calming but also eerie. Very good for atmosphere.\n\nUnlike many other reviews I've seen I personally did not find it all that creepy to be honest. The story is vague and completely unexplained. You play a frog, you dive down into the water where you find strange things happening to the other frogs. The enemies turned out completely different  in origin from what I expected from the screenshots and the game leaves you to draw your own conclusions about what happened. The effort for all of this is rewarded with a link to some website I didn't bother visiting. It's kind of eerie and surreal, but not really "creepy". I feel as though it tries very hard to be more artsy than video game, which isn't by any means a bad thing, but as with all art it's something very subjective.\n\nI don't feel as though I've lost out too badly for having only paid 60 cents, but as I said in the beginning, it is NOT worth $2.

After thinking about how I feel about the gameplay for a bit, I don't think it's very fun.  I actually find it to be a bit tedious.  It feels like I get stuck in situations where it's nearly impossible to save a frog, or survive an attack against jellyfish and that becomes frustrating.

All the way to the bottom. Let’s get started on this review.\n\nI – Story [10/10]\n\nThey Breathe from The Working Parts is what it is. It is a harrowing, terrifying journey through a flooded forest (gone mad) by the unlucky Glenn the frog. The deeper downward you swim, the more eerie and disturbing it gets. It’s your job to survive in a twisted ecosystem where the only thing that matters is getting oxygen. I won’t say too much else. If you were watching the stream (on Twitch or Steam) you’ve seen it for yourself whether you pieced the story together or not. If you weren’t watching the stream, you’ll have to find out for yourself what makes this bizarre environment tick.\n\nII – UI [5/10]\n\nThey Breathe has almost no user interface whatsoever. From the moment you dive into the deluge, it’s every frog for themselves. You are given one clue as to what you can do to swim faster, and boy will you need it. Aside from this, the only time any sort of directional HUD appears on screen is if you manage to swim outside of the current boundaries. While this is incredibly useful, I felt very conflicted about it because it detracted from the atmosphere of the game as a whole.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nThe controls of They Breathe are as simple as they come. You’ll make use of only two controls; swimming in any given direction and swimming faster in any given direction. You’re left to figure things out for yourself when it comes to offense.\n\nIV – Content [10/10]\n\nWhat They Breathe lacked in physical content, they made up for in mental trauma.\n\nV – Visual [6/10]\n\nThe visuals of They Breathe are hand-drawn and, for the most part, are just alright compared to most other games who share that artistic trait. While subtlety creepy, I personally feel that they could have been better.\n\nVI – Audio [10/10]\n\nThe majority of the game is deathly quiet apart from water-like ambiance and the terror-inducing screams of your enemies. When the music does come though, it comes in at just the right moment.\n\nVII – Overall [8.5/10]\n\nOverall, They Breathe is a fantastic game, especially for such a low price.","January 25, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And you are, for some reason, very determined to swim as deep as you possibly can. At first the game is deceptively soothing; The soundtrack is beautiful and the frog swims around merrily. After a while though, things become... weird. And you keep asking yourself what is going on.\n\nI don't want to say more about the story: The game takes only around 25 minutes to finish so anything more than what I've already said becomes a spoiler. Also, the big fun in this game is to explore and trying to figure out how to handle what you meet along the way. I don't want to take that from you.\n\nThe price is also good: It is a short game and priced thereafter, only 2 EUR at Steam.\n\nFinally, as a programmer, I also find the game inspiring. The game is based on a school project and you can tell that the mechanics behind the gameplay is very simple. It goes to show that producing a game, getting widespread attention, and becoming a hit on Steam is not that impossible: As long as you have some programming skills, some art skills, and a good concept to build around.\n\n7/10 bubbles","November 29, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

But while it's short, I certainly enjoyed it.\n\nGiven only the hint that the spacebar makes you swim faster and that you need to collect oxygen bubbles to breathe, a lot of this game is about discovery. You're left to work out the rest of the controls for yourself and initially figuring out what to do may take a bit of fumbling around.\n\nBut as you slowly learn how to move to the next level, you also learn more about the eerie ecosystem of the environment. Both through trail and error, and through watching the experiences of other hapless frogs, you discover the  harrowing evolution of the enemies you face and get to see the cruel truth of the dark depths.\n\nYou are left with a few unanswered questions of your own about the situation so if you like your deep and meaningfuls handed to you on a platter, this might not be the game for you. But if you are willing to bring your own deeper interpretation of the story told, it can be a very enjoyable experience.\n\nEspecially while on sale, would recommend.","December 26, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We all know the deal, and we see them tossed around again and again, handled in different ways but rarely executed in a way that truly exceeds expectations and shatters the very shell of perspective we as an audience have slowly formed around ourselves.\n\nThis rarity of vision is exactly what They Breathe was made to do. No, it doesn't involve dragons or knights, zombies or jump scares, nor does it have gore in the most traditional sense.

It is something like shorter Braid - you have to exlore your surroundings and story to truly get a grasp on what is going on around you.\n\nRarely can you see a game that really provokes your thoughts to this extent with such a minimalistic approach at the same time. When I've heard about this game for the first time I thought that I know what it will be about. But I was wrong, it is not so predictable. At least it was not for me.\n\nArt in the game is nice I like this style. So are the sounds that really helps to build up atmosphere.\n\nThe only real negative of this game can be that it is so short. You can get to the end in about an hour. There is some replayability, although probably not for more than one or two another playthroughs.

But while it's short, I certainly enjoyed it.\n\nGiven only the hint that the spacebar makes you swim faster and that you need to collect oxygen bubbles to breathe, a lot of this game is about discovery. You're left to work out the rest of the controls for yourself and initially figuring out what to do may take a bit of fumbling around.\n\nBut as you slowly learn how to move to the next level, you also learn more about the eerie ecosystem of the environment. Both through trail and error, and through watching the experiences of other hapless frogs, you discover the  harrowing evolution of the enemies you face and get to see the cruel truth of the dark depths.\n\nYou are left with a few unanswered questions of your own about the situation so if you like your deep and meaningfuls handed to you on a platter, this might not be the game for you. But if you are willing to bring your own deeper interpretation of the story told, it can be a very enjoyable experience.\n\nEspecially while on sale, would recommend.","December 26, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fantasy? Dragons, Knights, Princesses. Horror game? Zombies, gore, jump scares. We all know the deal, and we see them tossed around again and again, handled in different ways but rarely executed in a way that truly exceeds expectations and shatters the very shell of perspective we as an audience have slowly formed around ourselves.\n\nThis rarity of vision is exactly what They Breathe was made to do. No, it doesn't involve dragons or knights, zombies or jump scares, nor does it have gore in the most traditional sense. They Breathe is a tale about a frog named Glenn that decides to go for a swim, and decides to see how far down his little pond goes. They Breathe is a game you will never, ever forget.\n\nIt's 2 dollars, goes on sale often and takes a little under an hour to complete. So please, do yourself a favor and pick this up. Worst case scenario, you can earn back most of the money by selling the trading cards that come with it. Best case scenario, you will never look bubbles or moose the same way again.

All the way to the bottom. Let’s get started on this review.\n\nI – Story [10/10]\n\nThey Breathe from The Working Parts is what it is. It is a harrowing, terrifying journey through a flooded forest (gone mad) by the unlucky Glenn the frog. The deeper downward you swim, the more eerie and disturbing it gets. It’s your job to survive in a twisted ecosystem where the only thing that matters is getting oxygen. I won’t say too much else. If you were watching the stream (on Twitch or Steam) you’ve seen it for yourself whether you pieced the story together or not. If you weren’t watching the stream, you’ll have to find out for yourself what makes this bizarre environment tick.\n\nII – UI [5/10]\n\nThey Breathe has almost no user interface whatsoever. From the moment you dive into the deluge, it’s every frog for themselves. You are given one clue as to what you can do to swim faster, and boy will you need it. Aside from this, the only time any sort of directional HUD appears on screen is if you manage to swim outside of the current boundaries. While this is incredibly useful, I felt very conflicted about it because it detracted from the atmosphere of the game as a whole.\n\nIII – Gameplay [10/10]\n\nThe controls of They Breathe are as simple as they come. You’ll make use of only two controls; swimming in any given direction and swimming faster in any given direction. You’re left to figure things out for yourself when it comes to offense.\n\nIV – Content [10/10]\n\nWhat They Breathe lacked in physical content, they made up for in mental trauma.\n\nV – Visual [6/10]\n\nThe visuals of They Breathe are hand-drawn and, for the most part, are just alright compared to most other games who share that artistic trait. While subtlety creepy, I personally feel that they could have been better.\n\nVI – Audio [10/10]\n\nThe majority of the game is deathly quiet apart from water-like ambiance and the terror-inducing screams of your enemies. When the music does come though, it comes in at just the right moment.\n\nVII – Overall [8.5/10]\n\nOverall, They Breathe is a fantastic game, especially for such a low price.","January 25, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first.\n\nBut once you started the game, you want to play it to the end, because you're not only chasing oxygen bubbles. You're fighting for them. There are many other creatures you have to defeat underwater to survive. This game shows the real world in a way you haven't seen it before.\n\nThere is no introduction, no tutorial to show you how to play the game; you have to learn it all by yourself. I first didn't get the sense of this, but after playing a few minutes, it was obvious that the developers want the player to feel like the little helpless frog in the game, having to get to know the environment (or the controls ;) ) in order to survive.\n\nIt's a really cool game, but only if you let the atmosphere have an effect on you.","May 29, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

What's at the bottom?  Keep playing to find out.\n\nStart up the game and you are greeted with a screen to adjust your brightness settings.  Pretty standard.  On the keyboard you can use the arrows to move the slider left or right, or use A and D to move it.\n\nThe next screen shows your frog sitting on a log.  A log floating in a large blue body of water.  Not much else.\n\nPress a key to start the game.  Your frog dives into the water.  The game gives you "one last hint" to use the spacebar for a powerstroke, sort of like the sprint button when running in an fps.  To swim you use WASD or arrow keys to swim in a given direction.\n\nYour other controls are: ESC - pauses game and brings up a menu.  Q - quit the game.  R - restart the current wave.\n\nYou will encounter some other frogs floating up.  They're in danger of drowning.  How do you know?  Their facial expressions and their color.  The life indicator in this game is the color of your frog and the color of the exhaled bubbles.  Green means your frog is healthy, brown means your frog is dying.  Normal exhahled bubbles are squiggly and white.  If you're dying your exhaled bubbles are streaks of red blood.  To replenish health, swim into the round white/blue bubbles that come floating up from the bottom of the screen.  If you take too much damage you will lose the ability to sprint until you get more health.  If you take more damage you die.  The game will automatically restart you from the last checkpont.\n\nBack to those two frogs you just met.  They're brown, so bump into them to push them into the floating white/blue bubbles to give them some air.  Give them enough and they will recover and swim away to the surface.  That is how you rescue frogs.  If you neglect them too long they will drown.\n\nEventually you will meet some enemies.  The basic descriptions are: cows and jellies.  Cows can ram you to do damage.  If they get an air bubble they will supercharge and move faster as they try to ram you.  Prevent them from collecting air bubbles and eventually they will drown.\n\nThe jellies on the other hand are damaged by the air bubbles.  Lure them into a few bubbles and they will explode.  They will grab onto you if they touch you.\n\nAnother note, green bubbles are bad.  They damage you.\n\nKeep defeating enemies and helping your fellow frogs, keep diving deeper.  Eventually you will get to the boss.  There's a surprise for you.  A twisted one.  Have fun!\n\n","November 30, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Diving deeper and deeper in to the water, you collect oxygen to survive and deal with some very unusual creatures. And about 25 minutes later, it's all over, leaving you feeling a little bit weird.\n\nThe game does have achievements and trading cards, which might make it extra tempting for the collectors among you.

There are some creepy elements that gradually unfold to reveal what’s really happening the deeper you dive.  But honestly, it is more of a game that makes you think.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the “twist” in the game did not come as a surprise as I saw it almost immediately very early on.  However this did not prevent me from enjoying the game in the least bit.  The beauty of ‘They Breathe’ is in the presentation.  The game does not force any kind of a story on you but instead leads you on a journey to discover it for yourself.  There is the obvious discovery at the bottom of the sea, but it still leaves many unanswered questions that are up to each player to interpret for themselves.\n\nThe art style is simple and reminiscent of some illustrations you might find in a children’s storybook.  With the content being rather dark, it is both ironic and brilliant.  The soundtrack (consisting mostly of ambient sounds) is effective and the gameplay/controls are top-notch.\n\nI purchased this game for $0.61 on sale.  And although you can beat this game in under 30 minutes, there is some replay value (especially for achievement hunters).  This is a nice little indie title that is well-designed and fun to play.  I would recommend this game for the short, simple experience that it is.","June 25, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are some creepy elements that gradually unfold to reveal what’s really happening the deeper you dive.  But honestly, it is more of a game that makes you think.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the “twist” in the game did not come as a surprise as I saw it almost immediately very early on.  However this did not prevent me from enjoying the game in the least bit.  The beauty of ‘They Breathe’ is in the presentation.  The game does not force any kind of a story on you but instead leads you on a journey to discover it for yourself.  There is the obvious discovery at the bottom of the sea, but it still leaves many unanswered questions that are up to each player to interpret for themselves.\n\nThe art style is simple and reminiscent of some illustrations you might find in a children’s storybook.  With the content being rather dark, it is both ironic and brilliant.  The soundtrack (consisting mostly of ambient sounds) is effective and the gameplay/controls are top-notch.\n\nI purchased this game for $0.61 on sale.  And although you can beat this game in under 30 minutes, there is some replay value (especially for achievement hunters).  This is a nice little indie title that is well-designed and fun to play.  I would recommend this game for the short, simple experience that it is.","June 25, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has that simple story that says, "Here is a empty body of water, you dive deeper and you need to save lots of your frog friends."\n\nART/MUSIC (9/10):\nThe art of the game is really amazing! The art isn't like a replica of a real-life location and it isn't like a world we can explore on our own. It's art is like a panorama of a detailed underwater artpiece. The background is beautiful and the characters/enemies looks pretty unique. The music is great. The music makes the players feel mystified about what's going to happen as we journey deeper.\n\nGAMEPLAY (8/10):\nThe control is pretty easy, just using "WASD" and "Spacebar" to move around. The replability is not very high because once you achieve all of the achievements or finish the game once, then you'll be left with your impression of the game. There is also no clear objective to players and you had to find out what they are on your own or by watching others play the game.\n\nTOTAL SCORE - 9/10\n\nHere's my Let's Play of the game - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOENq5GdTmg&list=PLX761ogOIyK23auFPiq3TR-jwBZ9GKfhm","July 3, 2014","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When a weird game is listed for a dollar or two, I usually can't pass up the chance to check it out. Some reviews of this game act like it's this masterful piece of game design, or is a terrifying example of horror.\n\nWhat I think it is, however,  is a quirky minimalistic game with a weird atmosphere, in which you play as a frog. Diving deeper and deeper in to the water, you collect oxygen to survive and deal with some very unusual creatures. And about 25 minutes later, it's all over, leaving you feeling a little bit weird.\n\nThe game does have achievements and trading cards, which might make it extra tempting for the collectors among you.

Maybe not. Did I expect to find out what the heck i was supposed to be doing, either trough a manual or any kind of visual instructions? Likely. "The game is what you make of it", some would say.

Or maybe it is, if you have a horrifically grim mind.\n\nThey Breathe is a horror tale expressed entirely through realtime gameplay with no words or exposition. It's very short, but very much worth the price of entry to experience a very novel and chilling tale. Gameplay is simple but increasingly frantic. It's only about half an hour long, but it'll really stick with you.\n\nBTW. You can save the frogs. I'm sorry, frogs.

If you're very curious and you can get it very cheaply then go for it, otherwise play something you enjoy.\n\n*Edit to include response to developer:\n\nI appreciate your taking the time to comment on my review for this game. I sometimes wonder if writing negative reviews is ever really worth it or valuable because I know that I will be presenting a negative take on someone's hard work and effort, and something they take pride in as well as stating why I did not like something in which others find enjoyment. On the other hand I would want the people who are considering a purchase of this game to understand exactly what it is they're getting and spending their time on. I know that you have the best intentions with your comment, and I respect your work and effort greatly. :) While They Breathe did not work for me, I do not fault you or others for enjoying it for the story you want to tell, or the ideas you want to suggest with its art.\n\nUnfortunately, the 'twist' of using a flipped pale frog as the head of one of your enemies isn't something that is dark or even creepy. The jelly creature at the bottom of the lake which has frogs contained to it, releasing bubbles into the water, and the surrounding field of dead creatures, suggests that this is the great 'something' that is hording all the resources necessary for survival in the pond. There's the possibility that you, as the developers, are attempting to go deeper with that statement, that you are attempting to describe the human condition and humanity's greed, selfishness, and destructive power (the competition for bubbles) and how that power is used so that a few prosper and many others suffer. Maybe you're suggesting that an empire of wealth (the jelly creature and its bubble monopoly) are built on the fields of those who died to make it what it is (the field of dead), and how greed results in destruction of individuals. It could be that you're expressing your desire to inform others about the dangers in pursuing that path, that ultimately you'll become an extension of the terrible machine itself, if only to survive (the frogs that have become the 'heads' of the cow creatures) and that only someone with outsider knoweldge, or money, or truth, can save them from that existence. Perhaps the bubbles represent wealth, or money, or wisdom, and the player frog is a Jesus figure, or an intelligent business man, a messiah of some type who will descend into hell (that the other frogs chose in order to survive) to save them from their terrible mistake. And maybe you're trying to flip all that on its head and express that the pursuit of wealth isn't going to be something that takes you to the top (the surface of the pond), but actually brings you to the lowest of low (the bottom of the pond) surrounded by the sins that made you 'great' (the field of dead).\n\nThose possibilities, even if true, just aren't at all effective as told within the construct of a frog descending horizontally on a screen, through a submerged forest, towards a jelly creature below, in the mud.\n\nSo, art aside, the game really is a simple horizontol scroller where you dodge enemies, grab bubbles, try to help other frogs (before they become cow heads), and wrestle with difficult controls. Any sort of 'horror' or 'dread' element attached to the game is a serious reach, and certainly nothing that warrants adverstising as such. I've played and enjoyed many games that created intense elements of psychological horror. They can leave you with ideas and such that are disturbing to meditate and contemplate. Horror doesn't mean jump scares and startling the player, I agree, but sometimes I think message can be lost in ambiguity ultimately leading to creating something that is far less than what it's supposed to be.\n\nThe Breathe purports itself as something more than it is, and perhaps some see it as an insightful commentary into the depravity of man, but it's really just a game where you play as a hard to control frog as he chases bubbles.","March 22","false","7.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","7"

In They Breathe you play as a frog who goes down to the very bottom of the ocean. So how is the game ? Its actually quite decent and its kinda freaky too. Now for the pros. The game has a great art style which has alot of colours and cool enemy design. The gameplay is quite simple and fun. Youre trying to drown the enemies without giving them air. Now for the cons. The game is incredibly short and you can pretty much beat it in half an hour. The game has a few bugs that break the game. Overall theres not much to say about this title. Its quite decent and quite creepy game. A few bugs. Also its incredibly cheap and you cant go wrong with this title.

It is an experience. As other reviewers have said, the mechanics and atmosphere create a very real sense of helplessness. It is horrifying just how helpless and vulnerable you are. Even though it is very short, 20-40 minutes, I think this game is worth $2 but you if you're on the fence, you may want to wait until a sale. I played this game on the keyboard, not knowing there was controller support, and thought it was fine. Some of the clunkiness actually made it better, in my opinion, because I really felt like it made surviving harder and the whole experience more intense. Regardless, I will definitely play it again for the achievements and to see if I missed any creepy details in the background my first time through.

I was left longing for more - it fealt like build up that needed a more subversive and twisty ending. I respect the game's twist and don't want to spoil it, just noting that it felt like an incomplete narrative experience to me.\n\nBut, the designers obviously have some imagination and talent - I think they may make something really good down the track if they remain independant.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hattereth/recommended/294140/","hattereth","Mad Hatter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hattereth/","692 products in account","So there I was, sitting on my log when I thought I'd go for a swim.  As I began to go deeper I ran into a couple friends.  Bob and Steve were having serious trouble breathing, despite the plethora of bubbles around them.  So in my kindness, I lead them towards the air and they darted away without so much a "thank you."\n\nIt was about this time that I was accosted by what sounded and appeared to be jelly-fish cows.  Strange creatures, darting back and forth.  I didn't know what to make of them at first, but as they began to bump into me, knocking the air from my lungs, I knew they weren't good.\n\nTo my err in judgment, I continued down after the first "jelly-cows" attacked me, to find a couple more friends.  Jerry and Phillis, swimming among the under sea forest.  Had that always been there?  But they too were accosted by the jelly-cows.  They wrapped their hooved tendrils around them and took them to the briny deep.  I was horrified, mortified, shocked.  Two of my friends, died before my eyes.\n\nBut before I could dash to save them, I saw a glowing green bubble floating up towards me.  The stench, the putrescence...the horror that gripped my very being as the acrid stench of rot filled my lungs.  The jelly-cow had just farted into my mouth.  I gasped for air, the color draining from my body, I gasped and groped for the nearest air bubble as the green jelly-cow darted to and fro, all the while a trail of stench bubbles popping out its backside.\n\nIt eventually relented and returned to the deep.  Foolishly I pressed forward.  The leaves of the trees giving way to whiskered ♥♥♥♥ tubes.  Perhaps this was the diet that caused such a horrid stench in the jelly-cows.  But again, to my horror, I was accosted by more jelly-cows, but these were strangely headless.  Back and forth we darted, stealing my air as they went until finally they filled to the point of breaking.  Jelly flesh exploding in all directions, hooved tendrils flapping in the water like little phallic worms.\n\nDeeper I went, more and more jelly-cows and headless monsters accosted me.  So many friends lost along the way.  Jane and Rick....Tom and Cal...Cindy and Sally....all taken before their time.  Either gasping their last breathes as they evaded the relentless monsters, or wrapped up in phallic wigglies and taken to the deep.  Until finally, to my horror...I saw my friend.  The monster was wearing my friend as a face!  I had dared to hope that someone had escaped this terrible nightmare!  But woe unto me!  It only darkened the further down I pressed!\n\nThe jellied beasts were not content to return with the bodies of my friends as faces, but began to switch their desecrated skins between each other!  Passing their faces...my friends, between them as they continued to pursue me!  I can't say what drove me down.  Perhaps I knew I too was done for.  That ultimately I would die.  That I needed to know what would do this, why this would happen, why?!\n\nAt the very floor of the sea, I saw it.  I saw hell.  Corpses of friends, family, strangers...perhaps a whole civilization...  Bodies stretched out before me.  Wrapped among jellied bodies and phallic hooved tendrils.  And there at the heart of this horror, a clawed pearl that wore many bodies as faces.  One was even smiling at me.  As the air slowly leaked from its body, I realized I had shared its breathe.  I had survived this long by the air leaking from its wretched hide.\n\nI had to act.  I would lure the other monsters into this demon pearl until the faces broke free and the jellies died in pursuit.  Until finally, by some miracle...I was victorious...  The demon pearl exploded and I rocketed skyward.  As I rose to the surface, I saw much flash before my eyes.  Desecrated corpses, whiskered ♥♥♥♥ tubes, dead jelly-cows, and the names of strangers I had never known.  As I broke the surface, gasping for air, the handful of survivors were there.  Staring blankly at me.  We had all been scarred by this experience.  We all had somehow survived this terrible ordeal, but to what end?  After seeing such a genocide of my people...what life was left in this broken shell?\n","March 8, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","1"

Twenty to thirty minutes for a first playthrough is what you'll get, because the game doesn't have a lot of replay value. Consider that before buying this game!\n\nThey Breathe is a short game about a frog who dives into the water to find cows who are trying to kill him. It sounds like absolute nonsense and quite frankly, it is. Until you find out what's happening, that is. This innocent looking game will haunt your dreams. That's how intense and creepy this game is.\n\nThere is no real story to see, the game just tells you that pressing A (on an Xbox controller) will make you do a breaststroke and that's it. You swim down, defeating (surviving?) wave after wave of enemies. In the meantime, you meet other frogs who may sometimes need your help. Desperately.\n\nThe game is short but the time I spent with it was amazing. They Breathe is brilliant and I look forward to the next game created by The Working Parts.","July 7, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story is completely told through gameplay with no dialog and is very easy to spoil, which is why I recommend to simply play it rather then look to deep into it before buying and for $2 it simply is a good buy, especialy if you belive games can be as much an art form as an entertainment source.

Not scary, not creepy, not fun. Theres simply no content. Im not trying to be a debbie downer here, but I dont know why this game even exists. Not to down the devs, but I wouldnt even play this if it was a free flash game on some website that I found in middle school. Those days I was willing to give anything a chance if it meant blowing off time after classwork. To me, the game wasnt satisfying in any way. However, since this seemed to be a class project I do give props to the students. Making a game is a labor of love and probably needed to be kept simple and adhere to strict time constraints. Your game had no problems with it other than story. The plot was weird and creative, yet lacked any encouragement to keep going other than the traditional "play till beaten" concept. Conclusion: would I buy it or reccomend, no. Would I play again? no. Would I reccomend if free? no. Good work on the project guys, but this has no place in my library. I know many hours probably went into this game's creation, I applaud everyone for their hard work, and thank you for putting it on steam. Steam wouldnt be where it is today if it didnt offer variety.","February 7, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The game's aesthetic design is well executed and succeeds in being eerie, my hat off to the developers for crafting an effective setting. But I got to the end and wasn't particularly horrified, just surprised... and then disappointed. I can't bring myself to recommend the video game equivalent of M. Night Shyamalan's Signs.

It feels like a sub $2 game. It's not bad but it's not very good either. Hard to recommend really.","February 17","false","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","6"

Touch air bubbles to gain oxygen. Avoid enemies. Push other frogs into air bubbles so they'll swim away. The basic gist of this game has been done countless times (Bubbles from Williams Arcade comes to mind), and when it comes to moody ambient music I'll just listen to a Brian Eno album and avoid the middle-man.

The art style looked fun, the theme of the game was interesting, and I suckered myself into thinking that it would be one of those indie games that would be great, after hearing great things about it. I was wrong. The game has no substance. Sure it could be creepy if you put yourself into that mindset, but in all reality, I felt no emotion towards the game whatsoever. The gameplay is basic. You use the arrow keys or WASD to move your little frog around the screen, and enemies come in waves to kill you. This helps push the game in the wrong direction in my opinion, as I felt like it become repetitive far too quickly, surprising being that the game is only a half an hour long. The ending made no sense and was stupid, but maybe I was supposed to do something that I didn't, I'm not sure. The game just felt like a waste of time to me, even though I payed a sum of about 70 cents on it.\n\nMy verdict: 4/10\n\nThere are better games out there for your money, just look for them.

I wouldn't even call it a proper game, no, not even an experience. It's about frogs and how these frogs look like moose upside down. Big whoop. That isn't even a concept for a game, no matter how crazy it is (like this one). I can see the fun in it if you're drawing stuff like that, but creating a game about it ? Hell no.\n\nIt's a 20-30 minute game and it's highly experimential, and doesn't make any sense at all. Even if people tell you otherwise.

But I liked everything about it: The music sets a very good ambiance, the design really drawned me in (those are quality hand made drawings),and the monsters were really "intriguing", making me want to know "what the hell they were!".\n\nThe only controls you have is moving the frog up, down, left and right, and a quick swim to evade the ennemies. You need to figure out how to defeat a group of ennemies, and then it makes you dive deeper, and so on and so forth, all while keeping your oxygen supply so you dont die (they do breathe). It takes about half an hour to finish the game this way.\n\nThis is not the kind of game you are going to be playing over and over again, but for the price, music, and overall great quality game, it was a well spent 2$. If you have some free time and don't know what to play, check this game out. I dont regret buying and playing it.","August 26, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
