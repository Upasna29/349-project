It is a start but there still a lot more to do. I've contacted the team and made my suggestions and they say they'll take them onboard and see what they can do. This game has a lot of potential. but at the moment, sorry i can't recommend it. We'll see what time brings to the game","May 25, 2015","false","0.4"," 44 of 64 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","44","64","4","0"

So considering all the work to make a piece of video game/ roguelike history easily available I would say 5 dollars isn't a rip off if you like these kind of games. I have played a few hours and I have to say this game is really fun. Similar to Nethack and the like except I have noticed there is more of a maze set up rather than connected dungeon rooms and I think food just heals HP since I haven't had my character go hungry. There are also no classes to choose from. So yeah 5 dollars is a little steep but so far I don't regret buying the game but I can only recommend it to hardcore roguelike fans.\n","May 26, 2015","true","2.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","3"

This is a simpler roguelike from a time when the conventions of the genre were less defined and more flexible. So without complex religions, race and character selections, crafting or any of the other modern mechanics what makes this one worth returning to or picking up for the first time? The main thing is the quest is time sensitive. You have 300 Mobuls  (a Mobul is 100 turns) to retrieve a specific magic potion to save your daughter's life. And if you have looked at the screenshots, you'll see that there are a lot of mazes. This emphasises dungeon navigation as a mechanic, getting lost is a waste of precious time instead of an inconvenience. Also while there are no classes you are free to develop your character as you like, building combat skills right beside magic and priestly skills. And even though there isn't a complex religious system, religion is a factor. You will find shrines you can pray at or desecrate, the favor of the god(s) is important even if it's a simpler affair than current roguelike mechanics provide. It's not DCSS but then we wouldn't have games like DCSS without games like this in the first place.\n\nFinally I'll close this out with the game's real hook for me. This is Diablo style dungeon crawling, complete with fireball slinging warriors weilding holy artifacts against hordes of demons and an overworld village where you can pile your loot to the sky. I'm pretty sure this is one of "those Unix games" Brevik has referenced as a core inspiration for Diablo. It's also dripping in that funky 80s RPG geek charm. Return to a simpler time. Put on your favorite Rush album, crack open a Jolt Cola and stay up all night!","July 31, 2015","true","12.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It's just like the original we played 25 years ago but with pretty pictures instead of keyboard characters. This game is fun each and every time you play it. Basically you want to get the Lance of Death. It has multiple difficulty levels to keep you coming back for more after you conquer it, also has local, friend and global high score charts so bring it on. 100/100 Also it won't be quick if you finish the game but all the times you die will be and they will inspire you to come back for more.\n\n~Mazaraku~","May 27, 2015","true","6.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There are problems with it though:\n\n1. no sound\n2. sprites are not too good and less readable I think than ASCII\n3. MAJOR every time you are at the start of your turn on a square with an object on it the game brings up a menu to make you select between ignoring the object or picking it up, reading it etc. depending on what it is. You can just move or take an action rather than have to actually press the button to ignore the object but it's still annoying.\n4. You get HP back when resting or moving but there's no rest until healed button. Instead the closest you have is to do 99. which is 9 then 9 then 5 on numeric keypad which rests you for 99 turns. You will have to do this several times to get your hp back though and it takes AGES.\n5. There seems to be no fast travel or auto travel of any kind, it's just you and the movement keys, held down if you want to risk it.\n\n\nThere is a version of the game called Nlarn which is free. It runs in the console and has ASCII graphics but in most ways is more usable than this version.\n\nI'm still leaving a positive review though because I am having fun playing this version and I'm trying to trust the developers to iron out the problems.\n\n\nThe free version at http://nlarn.sourceforge.net/\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/nlarn/files/nlarn/0.7.2/\n\nScreenshot in town http://i.imgur.com/CP7zC8W.png\nScreenshot on level 1 of dungeon http://i.imgur.com/wNpRDDl.png","June 1, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Here's the thing:\n\nWhen I was a kid, my first computer was a TRS-80.  Many people reading this might not know about the TRS-80 so let me describe it.\n\nThe year was 1978.  The TRS-80 was black and white, had the type of monitor that -- well, it was the stone age of computers, if that makes sense.  The memory size?  4k.  That's K.  Four-thousand bytes.  That's it.   You could upgrade to the TRS-80 Level II and this took you to a memory size of 16k.\n\nWhat's that, you ask?  How did programs get loaded into the memory?  Floppy disk?  LOL, seriously, Silly Rabbit.  There were tape drives.  That's right, cassette tapes.  And a game like "Asylum" could take fifteen to twenty minutes to load.  And if the volume was too high on the cassette player?  NO GAME FOR YOU, RELOAD.  If the tape was old and the tape player kicked off in the middle of loading?  There were these flashing asterisks in the upper right corner of the screen and if there was an **E* for error -- time to load it again.  NO GAME FOR YOU, RELOAD.\n\nOne of the first games I had (and I loved) was Dancing Demon.  Check it out here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNT7nVOugTM\n\nAnother of my favorite games?  The Temple of Apshai.  WHich you can see here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiMtY5BxdM0\n\nSo let me explain -- the actual descriptions of a the rooms, you had to look them up in a manual.  That's right, memory was so precious that the programmers couldn't even put the descriptions of the rooms in the programming.\n\nFinally, check out another one of my favorites --Scarfman.  I got this for Christmas in 1980:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIUxmqe3jA4\n\nOkay, so this gives you a little background about XLarn.\n\nHow did computer games come about?  Basically, there were bored graduate students who needed a break from keying in punch cards into the mainframe.  What's a punch card?  Basically, each card was a line of code.  You stacked them all together, perhaps two or three hundred cards, and you would stack them in a reader that would load them, one after the other, into the computer.  Check it out here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se0F1bLfFKY\n\nOkay, so what's the point?\n\nThe point is that no matter how nostalgic you feel about something, don't let the feeling separate you from your money.  In case you didn't know, the word nostalgia includes the Greek root for "pain" -- alg.\n\nWhy did I want to experience a game like this?  This game proves that if you take a forty year-old game which essentially was made by bored graduate students to see them through the wee hours of the morning -- well, you can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.\n\nNo matter how nostalgic you might feel about those days and these days, don't spend your money.  $5 is way way WAY too much to pay for something that people that was cool before there were video arcades.  There have to be so free versions somewhere on the web.  And if there aren't -- well, you don't need it that bad anyway.\n\nOne of the reasons that people liked games as they evolved and as the computers changed to meet the wants of the public -- there began to be this concept of "Saving" progress.  People now talk about these kinds of adventures being rogue-like.  If this is what you could classify this as, then all I have to say is that rogue-like adventures p*ss me the f*ck off.  And the more suspicious I get that any modern developer creates a game as rogue-like to distract the gamer from a lack of depth and content.\n\nWhat's a way to keep people playing?  Well, you could basically provide them with a sh*t-ton of stuff to do.  Or you could have death be permanent and make the gamer start over.  Which is cheaper to make?\n\nThe little boy in me misses the days of "Dancing Demon" and "Crush, Crumble, and Chomp".  But the adult in me, you would think, would be smart enough to understand that, just as Thomas Wolfe wrote, you can't go home again.\n\nWell, here's the sad fact -- we're all getting older and marking time waiting for that ultimate moment that all mortals must face.  We're getting older and fatter.  And no matter how much you want it, you can't get that feeling back, even for $5.","January 10","false","2.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Crawl though the dungeon, bash monsters, gather loot, avoid traps other nasty things and and recover the potion to save your daughter and win the game. That's about it. And ofc. there is perma death and paying taxes - if you succeed and try again ;-)\n\nGraphics are simple tileset's and sound is non-existing. Which is nice bc. it helps the game to stay true to it's origin.\nThe user interface is practicable and makes the gameplay more easy, since you don't have to remember text-commands like 'mle' or 'sph' to cast spells.\n\nAs usual there are a quiet a few hidden features and combination of weapons, strange items to wear and magic effects to discover :-)\n\nWhat I miss from other larn-games is the option to create your own dungeon maps and tilesets. Pro-tip for the dev: Let the players upload their dungeon maps/tileset's to an online repository where they are accesible for everybody.\n\nTip for the old-timers: If you are are a old Larn-player recommend to start with difficullty-level 25....","August 27, 2015","true","80.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
