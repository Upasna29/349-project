"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonahMcIntosh/recommended/218700/","JonahMcIntosh","Muffins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonahMcIntosh/","480 products in account","I really enjoyed this game. You play through as cop named Angelica Weaver, who can receive visions from the dead, which she uses to solve crimes.\n\nThe gameplay is broken up into three different kinds of play. Most of the game will be spent in a sort of point and click adventure mode where you'll collect tools and other objects to help you progress through the game. I was actually suprised how much of like a classic point and click this felt like.\n\nEvery now and again you'll search a location more in depth with a more traditional hidden object screen with a list of objects to find. This was fairly well designed and only one or maybe two times was I asked to find an item that I wasn't sure what it would look like.\n\nAnd thirdly, occasionally you will reach a puzzle or minigame to mix things up. I really liked the puzzles, I never really felt all that challenged by them? But, I have played a lot of puzzle games in my time so, I might have had a lot of prior experience on my side. However, I don't believe the puzzles were meant to be all that difficult, instead just rewarding and fun to play with. I was quite happy with the puzzles.\n\nIf I had anything bad to say, the writing of Catch Me When You Can is a little clunky at times but has a good payoff. And, the voice acting was a little flat, kinda under acted at times. But, these were minor hiccups and I was able to take them with a grain of salt.\n\nThis edition also features some extra content which was pretty decent too. After you finish the game, you can go back and play any hidden object screen in an infinite object mode, where you find every possible object in the screen. Also, there's an extra chapter which surprisingly added a lot more to the story than I was expecting.\n\nI wouldn't just recommend this to fans of the genre, I'd recommend this to fans of adventure games with an open mind. Hidden Object games have come a long way and arguably have more room to grow, but this was a great bit of fun.","November 28, 2013","true","4.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

While there isn’t much plot It has a reasonable murder mystery premise to give you some motivation and initially the game made some logical sense e.g. use pruners to cut plant, find key, use key on door.\n\nFairly simple but not bad. Then suddenly it a case of there are 10 random bricks hidden in places that make no sense. They might be under the sofa, in a gutter, up a lamp pole and you have to find all of them by basically clicking everywhere. Even worse finding some of them requires using inventory items that could logically be used almost everywhere, so again, click click click..\n\nThere are some simple mini games to break this up the crushing monotony. But honestly it’s too late, you’ve already started to question all the decisions you’ve made in your life that has led you to this point of trying to extract some pitiful entertainment from clicking every pixel your monitor can muster.\n","December 11, 2013","false","0.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

If you already play HOG games, then you probably already know that.\n\nIf you're one of those people who haven't really tried them but look down upon them automatically as a non-game or something overly casual, consider giving one a try. I did, and I was hooked.\n\nHOG games are great when you're just looking to take a relaxing break and not for something that will raise your adrenaline or stress your brain too much.\n\nI posted this review on the Angelica Weaver title arbitrarily, but the others I've played are of comparable quality.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/218700/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Hidden object games have come a long way from their iSpy/Highlights inspired roots, branching off from simply searching for random objects in a scene of junk into something more akin to a casual adventure game. Angelica Weaver is an exceptional example of this, blending traditional adventure and HOG gameplay into an enjoyably ridiculous murder mystery, all held together with impressively high production values.\n\nCatch Me When You Can follows Chicago detective Angelica Weaver, on the case for a serial killer that seems to be copying a series of murders that occurred a hundred years ago. For reasons never quite explained, Weaver can revisit scenes from the past, and in doing so begins to piece together both the murders from the past and how they tie in with the present. It's predictably convoluted and ultimately leads to a rather silly and anticlimactic ending, but on the whole it's just compelling enough to keep you entertained.\n\nA bit more frustrating is its often confusing puzzle logic and consistent inability to properly communicate where you need to go. I'd often find myself clicking randomly around the screen hoping to trigger something I'd missed before, only to find I needed to travel several screens back and use a random object to obtain another random object which somehow let me progress past where I was. It's not so awful as to make me quit the game, but it's annoying to have to rely on the hint system so often when it should be a last resort used for particularly challenging puzzles.\n\nAlthough perhaps not a showcase of the absolute best HOGs have to offer, Angelica Weaver is on the whole a rather enjoyable (if occasionally overly self indulgent in both its story and illogical logic) casual adventure that is almost completely satisfying once you look past some of its more persistent issues. Though I doubt we will ever see a direct sequel, I wouldn't object if Mumbo Jumbo continued with this style and quality of HOGs, which are if nothing else miles ahead of most games of the genre.","August 9, 2014","true","4.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krayzkrok/recommended/218700/","krayzkrok","krayzkrok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krayzkrok/","523 products in account","The only thing that annoys me about this game is the title. "Catch Me When You Can"? When I can what? Be bothered? Find the time? It doesn't sound like much of a challenge! However, the game itself is better than its title.\n\nAngelica Weaver is a psychic cop. Wait, it gets better! Actually, it really doesn't, but when it comes to fruity storylines these hidden object games usually take the biscuit anyway. Honestly this one is better than most, and it provides as good a hook as any to find all those hidden objects. I also appreciated some half-decent voice acting for once, at least with the main character, who fortunately is who you'll be hearing most of the time anyway. I do like the fact that hidden object games have such strong female characters; some other games could learn a thing or two.\n\nThe game itself is a pretty good point and click adventure game for the most part, collecting objects in your inventory to apply them in other locations. It's not quite Monkey Island, but it's a good time. There are quite a few puzzles throughout the game, although you've probably seen their ilk before, and they're mostly easy. Stress free, you might say. You'll also find quite a few hidden object scenes, and really that's what we're here for right? Fortunately these are very good, some nice artwork and objects that help to push the story forwards, often prompting brief pieces of dialog from the main character. Even better, you can replay all of these from the main menu later to try and find every last object in the scene, rated by your speed. You'll only do this once after which you'll have memorized where most things are, but it's nice to see.\n\nThe game will last you at least 5-6 hours if you do the bonus content as well (which acts as a suitable epilogue to the main story), and another hour on top of that to do the infinite hidden object scenes, so it should keep you busy for a while. You can also unsettle your friends and family with Angela Weaver specific wallpapers and screen savers [not tested].","February 23, 2014","true","7.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

You can click on any word/description to get a silhouette showing the outline of the objects without expending a hint.\n\nThe puzzles were pretty hard, and I actually skipped a couple of them.\n\nThere's also the usual kinda of weird point-and-click logic where you need to use the exact right object in the right situation, even though you have in your inventory objects that would probably work as well.\n\nYou can find "hint tokens" all over the place; pay one each time you need a hint.

The main character has psychic powers that are used for a few things, including seeing the crime scene of the past yourself.\n\nThis game is pretty stupid on all levels. Most of the gameplay involves either clicking everything on the screen or trying all of your inventory items on every you can interact with. This game has plenty of adventure game logic too... there are several times where you're given multiple items that all have the same purpose, but you can still only use one specific item in each place. There are no interesting characters, and the story is just awful. This is meant to be a mystery, but it fails in that regard too, because you don't meet the killer at all until the end.\n\nThe game has only two positive points. The first is that the art is nice. The second is that there are some actual puzzles, though they're so easy that this almost doesn't count.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to anyone at any price above free.

The whole game lasts like 3-4 hours while the developers tried to stack it with story worthy of 500 book pages. Also, the introduction is very poor - "Hey, it's Angelica Weaver, she has some amazing magic powers and she's good at catching bad guys." - pretty much this. Puzzles are child's play, nothing challenging at all. There're some ingame achivements (finish certain puzzle on the 1st try without mistakes) and collectibles (70 police badges), but I find them quite pointless, I didn't find everything, didn't collect everything neither and I couldn't care less. Soundtrack is easily forgettable, nothing special about it. The only really good thing is the graphics, it has the movie-like feeling.

The graphics are truly fabulous and I love how you can move in a panoramic view in a lot of the scenes.

There are not a lot of things to do in any one scene but in adventure game style there are many places to go and investigate.","September 10, 2013","true","3.4"," 4 of 21 people (19%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","19","4","21","2","0"

I've tried it several times on two computers, deleting the files and starting over as recommended in the support section.  I get a little farther, then up comes the debug error again and the game won't load.  I suspect this is no longer supported, but they keep taking money for it.  It's a shame, because it's a pleasant game with reasonable graphics.  I would love to finish it. Instead, I must steer folks away from it unless they have money to gamble that this won't happen to them.  I'm running on Windows 8 with up-to-date drivers, etc., yada, yada.

The concept of a psychic cop solving crimes and going back to Jack the Ripper's day in ye' old London, solving those crimes, and then using them to help her solve the case she's working on in the present is very uniqie and entertaining. I give gold stars for originality plot wse but ultimately it's just not well done and comes across as slow and dull.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subsidiary/recommended/218700/","subsidiary","Wicked Baggins","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subsidiary/","920 products in account","A hidden object game is designed to be one giant iteration of I Spy, so it feels petty to pick on the plot. I’m going to pick on the plot. It’s so wildly convoluted. Angelica uses her mystical dreamweaver powers to travel through time, because today’s serial killer is copycatting a serial killer of a hundredish years ago. She must solve the mystery in both timelines, of course, making bad calls and chasing red herrings and through sheer trial and error of set piece, I guess arriving at the right conclusion? I can follow Ace Attorney. I can’t follow Angelica Weaver. All I can remember is that she walks into a surgeon’s place of work, and decides, based on the presence of surgical tools, that he fits a serial killer’s profile. Also, she is unable to enter a locked room until she finds thirty pieces of fabric, because the serial killer demands it. I’m not sure how the serial killer is enforcing this.\n\nI can also tell that Angelica Weaver can fit fifteen benches in her backpack.\n\nBut really, for what it is, it’s fine and short enough. You’re here to click on objects. Objects will be clicked. Crimes will somehow be solved. Shoes will be matched. Ghosts will ascend to happier planes.

I had suspected it would be boring and frustrated, but instead it was relaxing and enjoyable. I did not really understand the story completely, but the puzzles were straightforward, and navigation and art work very good. I liked the character, and the way the hint system worked, was good. In the end with the bonus content it took me around 6 hours to finish. Worth getting when on sale.\n\nTo provide some more detail:\nBasicaly you move between times to solve a serious of murders. It has four elements in it, point and click movement, colelct and use objects to solve problems, puzzle solving (fit shapes, destack in right order, word find, untangle), and hidden object. It includes a hint system, where you build up hints by finding dream catchers, or you wait for the hint bar to fill which takes a few seconds. The annimation is good, and there is a couple jump scares. The use of objects is well thought out and makes sense most of the time. There are a couple of things to do or find where I cant see how you would have worked it out without using the hints.\n\nSo I liked it, it the type of game you do once, and this six hours of game play.","January 11, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the story is a rather unintersting murder mystery without even much of a mystery, as all the victims were more or less random anyway. The puzzles in this game are also of the unlogical kind, e.g. use a mouse trap to splice an electric wire together or you run into situation where you need a stick-like thing and have three in your invetory, but only one works. The game never manages to establish a proper flow and you end up either trial&error through the puzzles or using the hint system, it's just not much fun to play.","June 21, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
