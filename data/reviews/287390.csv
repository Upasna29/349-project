"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualVictory/recommended/287390/","VirtualVictory","VirtualVictory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualVictory/","83 products in account","The differences  between Metro 2033 to Metro 2033 Redux are significant while the differences between Metro: Last Light and Metro: Last Light Redux are unfortunately miniscule and in some cases, non-noticeable. I personally purchased this game for some easy achievements but that's not to say I didn't enjoy what I experienced. However, I feel there's a bit to praise and criticise 4A Games on with this product.\n\nNote worthy additions to Metro: Last Light Redux:\n● Enhanced lighting. This time around Metro: Last Light has been brightened and it now features lens flares! Whether it's for the better, that's up to you to decide!\n\n● Many textures in Metro: Last Light Redux have been slightly enhanced. However, this enhancement will not be noticeable unless you're running the graphical settings on Very High.\n\n● Enemies are now more responsive to light and sound. If you fall from a high place or turn off a light, expect an enemy to investigate.\n\n● The addition of safes. Hidden throughout the game are safes with corresponding keys. These safes contain a variety of items including ammunition, military grade ammunition, grenades, throwing knives, etc.\n\nChapter enhancements (For users who have played through the original Metro: Last Light)\n\nIn the chapter Reich, you now have the ability to jump when you're in the chase scene with Pavel.\n\nWhile fighting the Rhino in the chapter Undercity, nosalises will now attack you. It makes fighting the Rhino a little more challenging, but not nothing you shouldn't be able to handle.\n\n\nAspects of Metro: Last Light Redux worth praising:\n● The ability to approach a combat situation in multiple ways. Sneaking, knock out kills, use of silencers, and using the darkness to sneak up on enemies. It may seem silly and common knowledge but many games in the current gaming industry fail to deliver anything more than just a watered down run and gun experience.\n\n● The new A.I. combat subroutines are irritating yet innovative. If you're approaching a combat situation guns blazing be prepard for some jumpy, trigger happy enemies.\n\n● The achievement progress saving system. In the original Metro: Last Light, progress was saved in a consecutive playthough. This time around you can reload checkpoints to accumulate kills, unlock safes, filter air time, burn cobwebs and unscrew light bulbs.\n\n● No unsynced voice and facial animations. Although a little wonky, the facial animations and voice are never unsynced from start to finish. That's certainly saying something considering the majority of the games created today have the issue with unsynced facial animations.\n\n● No 'in-game' store. The majority of developers feel the need to put a direct link to their game's downloadable content within the game itself. This angers some consumers while ruining the immersion they're trying to create.\n\n\nAspects of Metro: Last Light Redux worth criticizing:\n● Non-existant NPC eye tracking. I never realized how important eye tracking was before I played the Metro series. Almost all of the NPCs in Metro: Last Light Redux feel as if they're staring off into space, unaware of their surroundings or the player.\n\n● Copy and paste menus and user interface. The menu and user interface of Metro: Last Light Redux is the exact menu and user interface that Metro: Last Light used back in 2013.\n\n● The watering down of achievements within the game. While they may have added 5 new achievements, they have completely gutted 28 from the game, including ones that were from once downloadable content.\n\nNew achievements 4A Games has added to Metro: Last Light Redux:\n\n1. Veteran - Choose three primary weapons that use different ammo.\n2. Pyromaniac - Burn 50 Cobwebs.\n3. Engineer - Use 10 Lever Switches.\n4. Master Thief - Open 10 locked safe boxes.\n5. Cheers! - Drink at every occasion.\n\nAchievements that were in Metro: Last Light but were not present in Last Light Redux:\n\n01. Weapon Smith - Install all possible Customizations for a Weapon.\n02. First Draft - Write 10 of Artyom's hidden Diary pages.\n03. Tesla - Break 50 Lights.\n04. A Present - Take the Custom Pistol from the Locked Box.\n05. Businessman - Make 100 Purchases.\n06. Diver - Fall in the Swamp 10 times.\n07. Soup - Kill 5 Shrimp with Grenades.\n08. Equipped - Find all Equipment Stashes in the swamps.\n09. Walking Bank - Collect 1000 Military Rounds.\n10. Inferno - Set 2 Enemies on fire at once.\n11. Forgotten - Find the Hidden Ammo in the abandoned part of the station on the QUARANTINE level.\n12. Musician - Use all Musical Instruments in the game.\n13. Nobody's Home - Ignore the Phone Call in the Anomaly.\n14. Bloodlust - Kill all the Reds on the THE CHASE level.\n15. Van Helsing - Kill a Demon with the Helsing.\n16.

Shadow Ranger - Complete the game without killing any Humans unless forced to.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n20. Sniper - Kill 10 enemies with headshots using your sniper rifle.\n21. Artifact - Find 30 artifacts.\n22. Homo Homini Lupus Est - Kill 100 enemies with heavy weapons.\n23. Willpower - Сomplete at least one HUGE mission.\n24. Arachnophobia - Kill 20 spiders with your flame thrower.\n25. Specialist - Complete the SHOOTING RANGE and ARENA.\n26.

These type of business decisions only affect the users who have legally purchased this product. If people have interest in pirating this product, they're going to find a way around this restriction.\n\nThe original Metro: Last Light has been removed for purchase from the Steam Store. If you some how manage to find a Metro: Last Light Steam license from a 3rd party source, best of luck finding licenses for the downloadable content. My condolences go out to the users who care about achievements and have purchased Metro: Last Light before it was removed but did not have time to purchase all of the downloadable content. These users who have only purchased the base game will never be able to obtain 100% achievement completion for this product.\n\nI didn't enjoy this game as much as the original Metro Last Light, but I would certainly recommend it if the price is right.","November 17, 2014","true","53.8"," 412 of 440 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","412","440","13","7"

Metro: Last Light Redux offers more and I jumped straight in with an aprehensive smile on my face and a spare pair of pants by my side. So, what did I think?\n\nI freaking LOVE this game! A brilliant continuation of the story and once again the graphics are next to none. New enemies add to the scare factor and the lore of the games' setting. Everything that made Metro: 2033 Redux so good is back but with even more. The length of the gameplay for me was longer than the first game, which was welcome.\n\nIf you enjoyed Metro: 2033 Redux (I know I did) then you should definately purchase Metro: Last Light Redux. For me it ticked ALL the boxes and still managed to scare the S**T out of me! For this one reason I praise this game so highly. Never since the likes of AvP 2000 has a game managed to quicken my pulse and caused me to pause a game to take a breath. Developers take note, this is how you make a true FPS with horror elements.\n\n9/10","February 19, 2015","true","20.9"," 162 of 170 people (95%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","95","162","170","11","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/287390/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","For those that weren't aware of Metro: Last Light its first time around, the game is a direct sequel to Metro 2033, with the plot being set forth by the last moments of 2033. Russia has been decimated by nuclear war, and the only way people were able to survive was to turn the underground metro system into makeshift settlements. Above ground, animals have mutated into horrific beasts, and mysterious psychic beings called the Dark Ones lurk both above ground and below. In Metro 2033: Last Light the monsters aren’t the only danger, as different factions from Neo-Nazis to Commies and beyond are all duking it out for a doomsday device in a civil war for control of Russia’s remains. It’s up to Artyom, the player character, to learn more about the still-mysterious Dark Ones and try to keep relative peace throughout the metro. I really enjoyed the narrative. While the plot itself isn’t terribly original, the world and characters are expanded in the way a good movie sequel grows things not simply for growth’s sake, but to make the player feel even more like they’re in a living, breathing place.\nWhat makes Last Light shine isn’t how many things go boom or how many monsters get pumped full of lead. I mean there’s definitely action, and when it’s there it is satisfying, but where the game series as a whole really succeeded was in creating a palpable atmosphere dense with despair, anxiety, and powerlessness. In some ways Last Light improved on the immersion of Metro 2033 through fully first person cut scenes, expanding the game’s universe, and greatly improved graphics that brought out each spiderweb and puddle of mud.\nWith the narratives and worlds so tied together it seemed a bit jarring that gameplay took such a sudden change in direction. Thankfully herein lies, in my opinion, the biggest positive about Last Light’s re-release treatment. Now fans of both styles can be happy, as the game lets people choose from the get-go whether they’d like to play the more action-oriented style of the original, or boost up enemy damage and scale back the amount of resources available to play in the style of 2033.\nUnfortunately some of the other improvements that Redux boasts end up being largely inconsequential. While graphics technology has improved noticeably since the franchise’s freshman effort in 2010, I really didn’t notice anything looking particularly better in this version than in the Last Light of 2013. I’m sure that if compared side by side there’s probably a few nicer textures and models here and there, but all in all tech just hasn’t developed enough since then to make the visuals a viable reason to upgrade. Don’t, however, confuse that for me being displeased with the way things look. Though the game takes place in underground tunnels and barren wastelands, the game still manages to keep the screen from turning into the brown soup that so many desolate games do.\nThe art direction helps things too. Everything from the weapons to the underground "buildings" feel ready to fall apart at any moment, and the various people drinking around fires, shopping, and just generally going about their daily lives give the settlements in particular an organic, personable vibe that pull you into the world of Metro that much more. So while none of this is particularly different from the original release to Redux, it’s still pretty darned good.\nWhether or not you find Metro: Last Light Redux worth the money is going to depend entirely on what you’re buying it for. If you’re someone who’s never played the game, or if you’re someone like me that liked 2033 but didn’t appreciate the pacing changes the sequel brought, then yes, pull the trigger. The game becomes much more of a survival-horror title with the new available options, and if you’re new you can try both styles and decide for yourself. Otherwise, there’s really no reason to prefer the original over this remastering. The audio visual improvements are modest, and the added content of the DLCs are relatively miniscule. All in all, I myself had a great time with the title, and the Metro franchise is still one nuclear winter I never want to turn to spring.\n\n","August 2, 2015","true","161.3"," 175 of 193 people (91%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","91","175","193","12","0"

It is remarkable, and it is sad that it is not too well known. I didn't even know of its existence until it was on sale and steam recommended it to me, and I bought it due to the fact it reminded me of the Fallout series.\nThis game is brilliant, as well as its predecessor Metro: 2033 Redux. They both leave you with an eerie feeling that sticks with you, sort of indescribable. The overall tone of this game is of morality, it glimpses to the past and evaluates its crimes committed. Ultimately leading to a morbid journey through trials that is to undue the sins of the past.\n~Some Pros/cons I compiled. ~\nPros:\n+ Morality has its role to play.\n+ Its story progresses smoothly, and goes off soon after the ending of its previous game.\n+ Gorgeous, very atmospheric and it completely immerses you into this world of post-apocalyptic Russia.\n+ It's combat system is very well laid out, you can choose to be stealthy or simply go full on into combat.\n+ You get to choose from a nice array of weaponry, as well as possess some nice upgrades for them.\n+The story is affected by your actions.\n+They managed to include the antagonists of 'The Reds' (Communism), and 'The Reich' (Nazis) in such a way that it is not corny, but rather emphasizes the struggle not for only day to day survival in post-nuclear life but rather its political/social injustices as well.\n+It includes supernatural/spiritual scenes as well, nice touch.\nCons:\n- Some achievements are hard to get.\n- Very few minor graphical errors.\n-This game does not always hold your hand.\n- It ends.","May 27, 2015","true","12.0"," 112 of 122 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","112","122","9","20"

It was amazing! Every single bit was amazing so lets get right into it.\n\nPros:\n- Amazing Graphics (I don't reccomend running this on a Potato, sorry)\n- Weapon Customization (Alot better then Metro 2033 (Non Redux Verison)\n- Very gripping story that sometimes will have you on the edge of your seat.\n- Great DLC, Simple and Short and thankfuly it comes with the Redux Verison so thats a plus, ties in with the game and you can see what happened through the eyes of others (Palve, Khan, Anna)\n- Somewhat Replay Value (Morale Points and Endings, along with just taking a different apporach)\n\nCons:\n- The Morale points and the two endings, if you get one thing screwed up you will get the bad ending for whatever reason, its really annoying and can really ruin what ending you were trying to work for.\n- For me, i don't know why but playing on Surivial Hard Core i seen my self having more Military Grade Bullets and Normal Bullets, Filters etc in full supply which annoyed me, i am not sure if this is like this in Ranger mode so please take that in mind.\n- Somewhat stupid AI > Khan in level "Fate of the River" will stand there helplessly while you fight of a horde of mutants which is quite annoying. The Mutants do not attack him nor does he attack them.\n- (Somewhat of a spoiler for this one warning right now) On the last level D6 where you are tasked to kill a Tank if you die AFTER destroying the tank you cannot reload saves or die. You will crash to the desktop and have to restart the whole level which can be annoying but the D6 level doesn't last long.\n\n\nWell, this is not the best review out there of this game. But i do hope some of you know what your buying from reading this.\n\nThis game can be VERY challengeing on harder modes or easier on modes like Sparta.\n\nI reccomend this game to those Hardcore FPS gamers or anyone who like Post-Apoc Settings.\n","March 30, 2015","true","27.4"," 101 of 109 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","101","109","2","0"

Play at night in the dark with a good headset, set the voices to russian and the subtitles to whatever you prefer, play on survival/ranger and experience this game at its best.\n\n✓ Stunning visuals\nThey went a bit overboard with the bloom, but the rest of the game looks amazing. It really adds to the atmosphere and they did a wonderful job on the models/textures.\n\n✓ Good story\nIt picks up a year after Metro 2033 ended. This time it's darker and there's a different goal. As usual with post-apocalyptic games, it shows you that even if your environment is surrounded by deadly creatures, the humans are the real monsters of the story.\n\n\n✗ Some technical issues\n1. Atrociously low FOV that, upon modification, will screw up some HUD elements\n2. Many dialogues are un-subtitled if you play with russian voices/english subtitles\n\nVerdictIn a nutshell, Metro Last Light is like Metro 2033, but better and with boobies.

There is no other choice but to man up and fight the boss thrice your size with throwing knives and courage. This is Metro.\n\nMetro: Last Light is a very immersive, superb linear first-person shooter that has good stealth elements mixed in the sauce. The AI is pretty stupid though, and even one step you take without crouching makes them question the sound even though they have a dozen friends running around already. Another thing that really annoys me is changing between your throwable weapons, you have to move your mouse while in-game in a very idiotic way that I really cannot even describe. Also, when you're making a stealth kill, both you and the enemy stand up without any animation - it's looks very clunky, and your character doesn't go automatically back to the sneaking position, which is why I was spotted numerous times.\n\nThe Redux version of Last Light does not differ from the original at all, if you don't count some fixed lighting.

You should play Metro 2033 first. 8.5/10.\n\nYou know when you read a book/movie/tv/game series and you get to the end and just want more? I'm replaying this for the third time and I still get that craving for more once I've finished. It's a very well made game for one, having many different mechanics at work often all at the same time.\nYou'll need to manage your air supply when in toxic environments, represented as your gas mask filters which you will need to swap out every 5 minutes. You'll need to make sure your torch is topped up with energy, manually pumping the thing every now and again and you'll also need to make sure you're hidden from view, highlighted by the blue vial on your watch.\n\n*This game requires a moderatly well equipped computer to run at reasonable framerates.* The framerate itself is fairly stable and doesn't stutter or dip, at least that I know of.\n\nExplore the tunnels of the metro, the horrors of the destroyed Moscow city as you climb through the ruins of the city, dodging the shadows that flash every time lightning strikes. You'll then realise the shadows look noticeably human like. Enjoy the flashbacks to the last moments of the Russians' lives as they react to the explosion in the distance. You'll see many things in this game, you'll experience many different fear invoking reactions. If you hate spiders, you'll be scared. If you cannot stand small spaces, you'll be breathing hard. If the thought of the supernatural sends shivers down your spine you might consider putting on a jumper because being cold will be the new norm for you.\nThis game should be played after you finish Metro 2033 (redux preferred) as playing this first will really not make any sense at all.\n\nIf you choose to play this game, you'll be choosing to experience a fantastic storyline, spread over the two games and several DLC levels alongside the amazingly well polished gameplay that comes from managing your gas mask filters, gas mask screen (It cracks, you start dying) and the dirt and blood that comes from shooting dirty/bloody objects, or being shot yourself. I would give this game a 8/10 if not a 9/10.\nThe only reason I cannot give this game a 10/10 is because I personally find the ghost sections to be too uncomfortable for me to handle. And although I mention spiders being prominent I should mention one of the DLC's is literally just you being given a flamethrower and you burning down a spider nest. That was very enjoyable. Otherwise this game is flawless in my opinion and I'd recommend it to anyone, even those scared of the mentioned things because it's truly an experience that cannot be beaten.\n\nSide note: Writing out this review which I spent the most time on out of any other review instantly gets downvoted into hell while one of my stupidest comments which I spend no time on got voted to the top of their respective review sections. Well played 10 year olds, well played.","August 23, 2015","true","30.8"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","43","45","4","0"

I listened to the prespective of Artyom during the loading screens, even with the option to skip, this intreguing me to the character of Artyom and the story.\n✓ Gameplay is fun, including combat. You decide how to approach the situation, each choice has a consequence.\n✓ Challanging and doesn't hold your hand during the game like a toddler.\n✓ Neat mechanics, requires you to recharge your flashlight, you can wipe blood and rain from your vision when you're wearing a oxygen mask. this mechanic creating an immersive atmosphere, etc.\n✓ Wants me to play more.\n\nCons:✗ Voice acting can be a little off sometimes, very questionable.\n✗ Can be difficult to know exactly how to progress in some situations, but nothing to be noted, can be solved with a little exploring.\n\nVerdict:I literally want to play the game again, I can't stop thinking about it, I want more.

Whilst the world is glum the vast amount of unique areas and missions is staggering.\n- Ranger mode offers pure stealth, blow out lamps, unscrew lightbulbs, attach a silenter and plan your attack carefully.\n- Last Light offers more to explore than 2033. Supplies are higher in quantity but they're more scattered and ranger mode relies on exploration.\n- Boss like battles are excellent and the end shootout even more so.\n\nCONS:\n- There's a balance of cutscenes, fixed animations and talking whilst walking to deliver the plot but I found the latter a drag sometimes, risking detachment from immersion.\n\nVERDICT?\nRanger mode is a true accomplishment in a beautiful and varied thrill ride of a game.","May 3, 2015","true","17.9"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","32","36","2","1"

It is a follow up masterpiece, set 1 year after the events of Metro 2033, and the game, has become even more of a supernatural, terrifying, emotional and at all times dreary and depictfu montage of the  meagre existence of humanity after the end of the known world in 2013, the great nuclear armageddon. A beautifully crafted creation and adaption of Dmitry's novels, Last Light is an ambitious, successful and deep look at the human condition, and brings to meaning the real threat to our existence, is not anyone else, but ourselves. We created our own hell, and that is how we are punished, with an unforgiving and harsh reality forevermore. One will feel that his very existence is to that of a cog, wound in a wheel within clockwork, turning to make other parts function, and if he is not working, then neither will the entity.....read on..\n\n\nAs Khan puts it, "Heaven, Hell and Purgatory were atomized as well, so they must all remain here, forever to relive their moments", this line explains everything you come across, from the mutated beings of physical form, to the more neutral ghostly figures of the metro, to the anomalies, "no more evil..than say fire", to the ultimate phenomena know as the "Darkness" and "The Voices" encountered within Dead City. Interestingly the Dead City voices are not linked to the ghosts of past, but more to the intricate combination of a wound world no longer separated by physical and what we depict as supernatural or unnatural. A new world, though humanity may have survived, who's to say that those spoils of heaven, and those demons of hell didn't also? It is a subtle and at times, very frightening and scary experience in an example of the human condition and the struggle of mankind, we destroy ourselves, yet war brings the best out in us, a paradox of sorts that metro tries to answer through the minds of a similarily aged young man named Artyom. The Dark Ones return, this time as protagonists of sorts, and will help the player in realising the miracle? or punishment of this new world that tries so hard to extinguish the flame of human existence. "Try to gain an understanding of things, before you make your judgement", perhaps Khan is the divine in the flesh?, and the Dark Ones are really angels? what if what we thought was good, was not always that. and what was bad, was actually good. Think before you judge, one cannot describe the importance in this quote, you will see for yourself, do not be so quick to shoot or kill, but observe one that you think is evil, may infact be struggling to survive, just as you are.\n\nA few words cannot describe the sheer amount of emotion and level-headedness one must have as they venture deeper into the darkest parts of the soul. Old Moscow remains, soviet soul is there, but the world we once knew, it is all gone and you, and you alone must discover what it means to forgive, to show understanding and to change, otherwise, what good is all the blood you've spilled, in your belief of a better world....perhaps redemption for your own sins commited at Ostankino? All that you were told was wrong, and now you, trained to be the best, take it upon yourself to see it through, to change the very course of humanity, so that whatever hope exists on a burning candle, it may persevere for a world, one day that our children may see as...human.\n\n\nAre we all in this together? Why do we fight? Why is our journey one of hardship, loss, pain, anger and why do we seek vengeance? Why must I do this alone? All are questions you will repeatedly ask yourself as you venture through the dark underground of Moscow's metro tunnels, to the harsh terrains of a thawing nuclear world with new treasures and dangers. Last Light explores the darkness of the human soul, the very essence that our greatest enemy is not the demon flying overhead, or the nosalis' stalking our tunnels but our own brethren, men whom we call friends, who we eat and drink with, at a moment's notice turning against everything that you believed in.\n\nThe moment that caught my very essence was the friendship forged with Pavel, initially a, lighthearted, comedian of a red line soldier, whom you learn turns out to be more than meets the eye of innocence. A high ranking officer of the Intelligence Bureau, your travels together, form a friendship that even a man of his caliber shows reluctance to carry out his orders. A man sworn by oath, a soldier, many of us are, and how to set aside our morality is what plagues us, but is what makes us human, and if we lose that, then what is left of humanity in this new, frightful, threatening and aggressively destructive world? Without a doubt facing Pavel's men in "Red Square", a name of Soviet origin, a place of souls, trapped and eternally confined to pain and loneliness was the greatest moment of conflict I had faced, I chose to spare him, for without forgiveness Artyom loses what makes him unique, his ability to forgive, in a world where war still ravages on, even though humanity has all but destroyed itself in the last one.\n\nI cannot measure this game in the finite terms of numbers, this is a masterpiece, far beyond any rating, exceptionally charged and absolutely raw. Whether it be from the dark, abandoned, and haunted tunnels of "Regina" to the unforgiving conditions and insightful observations by the baby dark one in "Undercity" and "Bridge", to the sad and mundane existence of all that's left of humanity in "Dead City", to the feelings of mateship and strength in "Separation" to the utterly heartbreaking yet redemptive events of "D6" this experience delves into the very machinations of humanity, our eternal struggle for existence and our continuining hunger for the unobtainable, which leads us to our very own destruction, repeatedly, time and time again, a wheel of fortune, where the prize is death and the winner takes nothing to his grave. So please before you think it carefree to be completely devoid of a sense of soul, experience this for yourself, see if you have what it takes to really save your world, one you treasure so much, hold so dear and want to stay the same...all they wanted was a world they could live in, reclaim what was their's, remember you shape your own destiny no matter what forces move against you, it is your choice how events will transpire. This experience will live long into my future, and no suprise I would let my own son and daughter experience it in 20 years time.\n\nThis is a thing of pure art, it should be preserved in the great library of human thought and development, preserved for generations to experience, through a heartfelt, honest but raw and untouched story that if we do not work together, arms linked against the wind, then what are we, men against a blaze of progress that we cannot control? I have said more than enough, experience this, you have not understood true passion and pain until you venture into the Metro.\n\nStay tuned, I'll have even more to add once I come to the conclusion of forming my further observations regarding the in game events.....","June 26, 2015","true","61.7"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","25","27","4","3"

They are based off the popular post apocalyptic fiction book by Dmitri Glukhovsky. Metro Last Light does not follow the story line in the book, instead it is a direct sequel to Metro 2033 (the game and book). Metro LL (last light) is a game I believe everyone should try.\n\nGraphics\n\nIf you have heard of this game, which you probably have, it is not unknown that this game is visually outstanding. On my GTX 970 I had the game maxed out with a high framerate, well the majority of the time. Entering the mission often made my frames drop but thats too be expected with this game. The attention to detail is phenomenal, every part of the Metro has been carefully engineered with precision to create the look of a worn and dying civilization. This attention to detail creates an immersive and atmospheric game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=607229675\nGameplay\n\nJust like the original game Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light is played from the perspective of Artyom, your player character. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but occasionally missions bring you above ground.\nAs a first person shooter, the gunplay has to be perfect if the developers wish for success, they have got it right. There is a small selection of weapons, which was suprising, but the customisation compensates for that. Who needs a sniper when you can find a revolver and add an IR sight and a stock; even a suppressor for you stealth fanatics.\nThe games plot is excellent. The Metro is very atmospheric and immersive thanks too the excellent graphics, the slow paced solo guitar music and the excellent plot. I won't go into detail as I don't want to ruin the stroy for anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of experiencing the Metro games. Essentially you, Artyom, wipe out the Dark Ones with a plethora of nuclear bombs- or so you thought. Intense radiation plagues the streets; which has caused mutation in many species turning them violent, untamable and monstrous.On the way you meet people , meet the civilizations (Hanza, Reich, The Order) and have a great time. There is a sexual nature to some of the scenes so do take that into account. The game does seem to throw enemies at you sometimes which to me could be the downfall of the gameplay.\n\nMusic/SFX/Voice Acting\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQg2RZ7Bd7g\n\nThe music is good in this game, as of now I don't have a good headset so the audio isn't of a good quality; but the music and sounds in this game were great. One of my weaknesses in games is that I somehow block out music and it tends not to register in my mind, or my brain disregards it- but I have listened to the starting music multiple times and it creates an aura of atmopshere, a post apocalyptic atmopshere. As you listen you can imagine the sadness in the citizens of the Metro, its played by one person- with a guitar ,I'm not sure which type. He is playing slow notes in a memorable tune which masterfully creates atmopshere.\nThe gunshots in this game sound on par with modern military games which is great, the sounds of the beast are definately threatening and after you encounter one, you are always weary of hearing a battlecry of the beasts.\nAs this game is set in Russia, they had to find talented voice actors that could speak English with a Russian accent, they did a good job overall, although some of the charcters were clearly faking the accent which at some point sucked me out of the immersive grip that the Graphics and Gameplay had on me.\nConclusion\n\nOverall this game is a must play from me, works great on PC with keyboard and mouse, and I'm guessing a contoller would work well too. The game has great gunplay and a stellar story line, which can be let down by the feeling that the game throws hordes of enemies at you for nothing else than to make you have more gametime.

Exact your revenge and kill those who deserve it, or show them mercy.\n\nThat's my pitch of it, but I think they were definitely going for the benefit of multiple playthroughs being a different experience, but one chosen by the player, and if me being eager to start on my second playthrough with a handicap proves it, then it's true as anything.\n\nThe ending, naturally, changes, though I don't know to what extent yet, maybe a little, maybe a lot.\nHonestly I don't care too much about to what extent the ending does change because the choices you make, at least in my experience, do a good job of sticking to you, like it wasn't some character who did those things, but the player himself.  It's a good example of the journey being more important, more vauable than the destination.\n\nNot a perfect game, of course, but an impressive one nonetheless.\nHarrowing, and yet exciting, endearing and yet brooding, beautiful and yet mournful. If there's one thing that the game offers, it's a world that feels every bit real and alive as one could wish.  Quite an accomplishment for a setting so permeated with death.\n\nI didn't play the original version, but from what I understand it Redux is an overhaul of sorts.  A generally a more fleshed-out experience. They likely upped the graphics a bit, the sounds, and generally gave it a nice boost in all departments.\nI have no proof on hand, but I'm eager to believe; it looks like they put enormous amounts of effort into making this thing what it is and there is no part of me that wishes to doubt.\n\nAs far as length goes, I probably missed a bunch of stuff but then I'm a slow player anyway, and I got about 16 hours out of a playthrough on Hardcore.  I'd say expect about 13-17 hours depending on how generally quick you are.  Not a bad length for an FPS of such quality at all.\n\n\nA spectacular game in every sense of the word, breathtaking and an amazing experience.

Мутанты крадутся по катакомбам под пустынной поверхностью и парят в отравленных небесах. Но вместо того, чтобы объединить усилия, города-станции погрязли в борьбе за абсолютную власть и устройство судного дня с армейских складов D6. Назревающая гражданская война может навсегда стереть человечество с лица Земли. В роли Артема, отягощенного виной, но движимого надеждой, вы владеете ключом к выживанию – лучом надежды в этот темный час\n\nОписание продукта:\n\n✔Metro: Last Light Redux – самая лучшая и полная версия классической игры Metro: Last Light, обновленная с применением последней, самой совершенной версии графического ядра 4A Engine для игровых систем последнего поколения.\n\n✔Игроки, не знакомые с серией, получат один из лучших сюжетных шутеров за всю историю жанра – эпическое приключение, сочетающее в себе захватывающий «Сурвайвл-хоррор», исследование местности, тактические бои и стелс. В это издание входит также весь выпущенный ранее загружаемый контент, который добавляет дополнительные 10 часов к игре в одиночном режиме.\n\n✔Поклонники игры в ее исходном виде заметят, что механика улучшилась, и появилось новое –например, возможность в любой момент узнать время и боезапас, а бои и фигуры игровых персонажей заново анимированы.\n\n✔Те, кого привлекал знаменитый приквел Metro 2033 с его ориентацией на хоррор и выживание, смогут сыграть по-новому, поскольку теперь появились два способа игры – «Выживание» и «Спартанец». При первом способе Last light из игры с упором на сражения и скрытные действия превращается в тихую, но напряженную схватку за выживание.\n\n✔Несравненный Режим рейнджера делает игру еще более захватывающей и сложной, так что Metro: Last Light Redux обеспечит вам часы развлечения по очень выгодной цене.","February 3, 2015","true","9.9"," 46 of 80 people (58%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","58","46","80","19","10"

The game looks amazing as hell but the linearity of some of the levels can be a little bit on the falling flat side of things. The voice acting can sound a little awkward at times but that won't bother you. I would recommend playing this game in the gamemode survival rather than spartan, because then you can feel truly immersed. Now, the difficulty I would put on the highest, you know for immersion! But I didn't like the buisiness practices with ranger mode and the pre-ordering. But talking about the amount of immersion in this game is that the reloading animations are so accurate compared to other games. I also like that you have to put a mask on everytime you go out of the metro and if dirty things come on the gas mask, you can wipe it off. I also like the watch. When you are being detected by enemies, the watch screen will go black. When not detected, it will become blue.\n\nNow, that is where I jump into the stealth addition of Last Light. The stealth is and cover is fairly decent and you can take out enemies non lethally, or lethally depending on what you want. But you have to watch out if the enemies don't wake up. I also like that surpressed guns are not always quiet and people will feel like they've heard something out of the ordinary. But the stealth players are only really for the people who are playing on survival on a hard difficulty. Basically I just trying to tell you that this game was not made for a "going in guns blazing" type of game. The story is also fairly decent and sometimes I feel like the metro train track sequences can feel a bit too much like a rail shooter which not everyone will feel totally okay with. Is this game as good or better than Metro 2033? Maybe not but it's a subjective topic.

The game also takes a great and realistic approach to stealth where you have to turn off lights so enemies wont see you, and sound also makes alot of diffrence wether you use a gun or a knife. And if you're not into stealth it also has a 'Spartan Mode' where ammo and health is more common, making it more fast paced. But the real challenge sits in Ranger Mode.\nThe games story is also great. I enjoyed every moment of it, and it really ties together. (Since its based off a book.) But it also has a secret ending for you to figure out how to get it.\nIt also has a currency system, which you can use as ammo aswell but stronger than the one you usually use. Aswell as a excellent customization system with a bunch of diffrent guns you can find throughout the metro. The AI though can bug out sometimes (for example an soldier just going back and forth through a doorway.) But it wont happen to often and when it does it can be very fun to watch!\n\nAnd the game isn't just alone, it also has a couple of DLC's packed up with it. Some better than others, but surely also enjoyable.\n\nOverall i give this a 9/10 it is a great horror-survival game with an amazing atmosphere that drags you into the story.

The textures & models are pretty good, however the lighting is just beautiful and environmental effects add a great deal to the world. This may easily well be the best looking game I have ever played. Perhaps finally besting Crysis.\n\nYou have to manually charge the battery that powers your light every now & then, replace the filter on your mask, along with a whole bunch of other little things that make the game just that much more immersive. But none of these little things ever feel like they're in the way, if anything they add an element of immersion I wish other developers would bother to put in their games.\n\nThe guns feel great and there's not one to date that's felt as good to let off some rounds. Each has about 3-4 customization options from stocks and scopes to different barrel tips among other weapon specific components.\n\nThe human AI can be a bit janky at times and a bit stupid but mutants are intelligent and you'll spend plenty enough time fighting them to keep things interesting. At launch of the origional, I come across maybe 2-3 bugs through the whole game, one of them forced a checkpoint restart. Though checkpoints are hardly more than 10 minutes apart so it's not an issue at all, as there were barely any bugs in the first place.\n\nThe world is mostly linear but often allows for some exploration after about two to three hours into the game. If they were to make a Fallout-esq open world game in this world that wasn't so story driven it could easily be game of the decade worthy.\n\nThe story is alright, the world is interesting, and occasionally you'll encounter the game's horror element which does indeed go beyond creepy mutants crawling about. Though in the end, I have pretty much no issue with the game at all aside from it holding your hand too long at the start.\n\nAll in all, its certainly worth the $45 I paid and I encourage you to play ranger mode even if you're new.","January 24, 2015","true","1.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

However, I have played Metro 2033 Redux and it's an incredible game.\n\nStory:The game takes place one year after the events of Metro 2033. The story continues from the canonical ending, better known as the “bad ending” of 2033. You resume the role of Artyom as he is now a Ranger. After launching the missles and seemingly wiping out the Dark Ones, Artyom's remorse for his actions have led him to having chronic nightmares. But when Khan informs Artyom that he has discovered a surviving Dark One in the Botanical Gardens, there may be one last hope for redemption and the future of humanity. Meanwhile, when word gets out that The Rangers have occupied D6, rival factions gear up to take control of the facility and it's supplies for themselves.\n\nGameplay:The gameplay in this is amazing. The game switches back and forth between stealth and heavy shooting. It keeps the game fresh and it never feels dull. On some levels you'll be turning lamps out, hiding in the darkness and knocking out soldiers as you quietly try to complete your objective. On other levels, you'll be surrounded by a swarm of mutants as you blast away with your shotgun. Once again, on the stealth levels, stealth isn't mandatory but it's certainly advised and much more fun. But if you absolutely hate stealth, you can blast your way through everyone so long as you aren't playing on a hard difficulty. Just like in 2033 Redux, there are several types of mutants from nosalis to watchers to the occasional demon among others. And just like in 2033 Redux, you'll come across weapon shops periodically where you can spend your military-grade rounds on guns, upgrades for your guns, ammunition, medkits and more. The moral point system returns in this game. It's one of the only things I don't like about the game. I like the idea of playing a role and choosing between good deeds and bad deeds, but this game seems to arbitrarily give you moral points for random things such as discovering a dead body in a dark corner or exploring the level and finding a secret location. Because of this, it's very easy to get the bad ending in this game, much like it was in Metro 2033.\n\nMetro: Last Light Redux includes all of the downloadable content from the original Last Light including the Faction Pack, the Tower Pack, the Developer Pack, the Chronicles Pack, the DLC-exclusive weapons and Survival Mode. There are apparently some graphical upgrades, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the look of this game and the original Last Light.\n\nConclusion:Overall, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of post-apocalyptic games, FPS games or stealth games. The story keeps you interested, the gameplay is great and keeps you hooked, while the graphics are gorgeous and creates an incredible atmosphere throughout. Once again, I would suggest that you play Metro 2033 Redux before this game as it will help you understand the story and it's just as good as it's successor.","July 24, 2015","true","29.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have no problems with that, because it creates atmosphere. But in many circumstances i found myself out of air, running to a hard-to-get objective with a handfull of enemies chasing me while i had no ammo. I was saved by cutscenes 1/3 of the time, but the rest was just the death screen. One thing that comes up alot in Last Light is CONSERVE. You need to conserve everything, if you dont, you might aswell restart the whole chapter. (I restarted 3 times just to say the least.) I feel like Last Light has an evil triangle; If you don't die by lack of air, you will die by enemies. If you don't die of enemies, you will eventually run out of ammo and might aswell die by the lack of air.\n\nYou also find yourself alone over 80% of the game, which i think is fantastic for these types of games. It really brews up the atmosphere, and the immersion is top notch. Although i wouldn't put this game in a "horror genre" i would more likely put it into atmosphere and immersion.\n\nThe redux made the game better on all fronts, i suggest you buy it at once. The developers really made a good sequel to an already fantastic game.","October 18, 2014","true","5.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Dark, moody, oppressive, challenging and sometimes frightening. Metro last light is a FPS survival horror stealth post apocolyptic game set in the ruins of moscow. A great game and very entertaining.\n\nI have a few issues with it, though minor ones. For one I find it odd how artyom (the main character) never speaks outside of cutscenes or loading screens, which makes it seem like he gives other characters the silent treatment. I like silent protoaginists like in half life but when the character speaks and has a personality it is abit weird.\n\nIm not fond of the romantic sub plot as it seems rushed and frankly the "love intrest" makes a total 180 in terms of personality. It falls flat and isnt very effective. The strip club scene was also very stupid and ruined the atmopshere.\n\nIt has a few technical issues, the severity of them depends on the type of PC you have. A high end powerful pc like mine experianced them rarely. For lower end rigs you might not be able to play it at all.\n\nMy final complaint is the whole "moral system" seems abit convuluted and doesnt make that much sense. It had potential it just felt very cryptic at times and choices often never really clear.\n\nBut regardless its a REALLY great game, despite its issues. 9/10","January 5, 2015","true","16.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pixyunicorz/recommended/287390/","Pixyunicorz","Tricky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pixyunicorz/","46 products in account","For those that weren't aware of Metro: Last Light its first time around, the game is a direct sequel to Metro 2033, with the plot being set forth by the last moments of 2033. Russia has been decimated by nuclear war, and the only way people were able to survive was to turn the underground metro system into makeshift settlements. Above ground, animals have mutated into horrific beasts, and mysterious psychic beings called the Dark Ones lurk both above ground and below. In Metro 2033: Last Light the monsters aren’t the only danger, as different factions from Neo-Nazis to Commies and beyond are all duking it out for a doomsday device in a civil war for control of Russia’s remains. It’s up to Artyom, the player character, to learn more about the still-mysterious Dark Ones and try to keep relative peace throughout the metro. I really enjoyed the narrative. While the plot itself isn’t terribly original, the world and characters are expanded in the way a good movie sequel grows things not simply for growth’s sake, but to make the player feel even more like they’re in a living, breathing place.\nWhat makes Last Light shine isn’t how many things go boom or how many monsters get pumped full of lead. I mean there’s definitely action, and when it’s there it is satisfying, but where the game series as a whole really succeeded was in creating a palpable atmosphere dense with despair, anxiety, and powerlessness. In some ways Last Light improved on the immersion of Metro 2033 through fully first person cut scenes, expanding the game’s universe, and greatly improved graphics that brought out each spiderweb and puddle of mud.\nWith the narratives and worlds so tied together it seemed a bit jarring that gameplay took such a sudden change in direction. Thankfully herein lies, in my opinion, the biggest positive about Last Light’s re-release treatment. Now fans of both styles can be happy, as the game lets people choose from the get-go whether they’d like to play the more action-oriented style of the original, or boost up enemy damage and scale back the amount of resources available to play in the style of 2033.\nUnfortunately some of the other improvements that Redux boasts end up being largely inconsequential. While graphics technology has improved noticeably since the franchise’s freshman effort in 2010, I really didn’t notice anything looking particularly better in this version than in the Last Light of 2013. I’m sure that if compared side by side there’s probably a few nicer textures and models here and there, but all in all tech just hasn’t developed enough since then to make the visuals a viable reason to upgrade. Don’t, however, confuse that for me being displeased with the way things look. Though the game takes place in underground tunnels and barren wastelands, the game still manages to keep the screen from turning into the brown soup that so many desolate games do.\nThe art direction helps things too. Everything from the weapons to the underground "buildings" feel ready to fall apart at any moment, and the various people drinking around fires, shopping, and just generally going about their daily lives give the settlements in particular an organic, personable vibe that pull you into the world of Metro that much more. So while none of this is particularly different from the original release to Redux, it’s still pretty darned good.\nWhether or not you find Metro: Last Light Redux worth the money is going to depend entirely on what you’re buying it for. If you’re someone who’s never played the game, or if you’re someone like me that liked 2033 but didn’t appreciate the pacing changes the sequel brought, then yes, pull the trigger. The game becomes much more of a survival-horror title with the new available options, and if you’re new you can try both styles and decide for yourself. Otherwise, there’s really no reason to prefer the original over this remastering. The audio visual improvements are modest, and the added content of the DLCs are relatively miniscule. All in all, I myself had a great time with the title, and the Metro franchise is still one nuclear winter I never want to turn to spring.\n","December 29, 2015","true","10.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

I especially love the atmosphere that Metro games generate: from the sounds to the meticulously crafted environment. If you have the machine to run this game on maxed out settings, then get ready to be blown away by some of the most impressive visuals ever. All of these features really gets you immersed in the game world, which is approriate for the nature of this game.\n\nAlthough you can play this game in run and gun mode, I highly suggest you choose the more difficult modes that make it harder to find ammo and so on. This makes the game more tense as you will have to constantly be on the look-out for threats and supply. One time, I had to use up all my bullets, grenades, mines, and throwing knives to kill this one particularly tough mutant (I killed it with my last throwing knife!).  The relief you get when you find a safe zone or friendly character after each journey or life-threatening situation is nothing short of impressive. Safe zones are generally places in the game where you can relax after a tough fire-fight or a heart-pounding escape from mutant hordes. There you can upgrade and trade your gear, participate in events, and meet new characters.\n\nThe story picks up from where Metro 2033 ended and introduces new goals and twists that will make you question the nature of human morality. Metro: Last Light does suffer from some bugs and glitches more than the previous game in my experience, but I have not ran into anything game-breaking.\n\nOverall, Metro: Last Light Redux is a very well made title with many things you would expect from a good post-apocalyptic FPS. It's got impressive set pieces and audio to keep you immersed, tense combat that keeps you alert, and a well written story that makes it a worthy sequel to its also excellent predecessor.","May 10","true","27.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

Blue pill or red pill neo?\n-Spider Lair: a linear vent crawling, lighter, blowtorch simulator. Although executed much better than alan wake\n-Developer Pack: has a museum to see 3d models & animations of characters & monsters, has a shooting range with time challenges (worthwhile to attempt), & arena that allows you to pit monsters against monsters (hit or miss)\n-Pavel: a descent mini chapter where you try to escape after being held captive\n-Khan: great narrative & paranormal/anomalies! More compelling than most of what is on the main story line\n-Anna: a better sniper chapter than "Sniper Team" in my opinion. Overlaps anna's encounter with atryom on the main story line\n\nOverall, a drastic improvement from metro 2033 (a game I found unbearable). This game is rough around the edges which needed a lot more polish, definitely a wasted opportunity for a more open world game, but a above-average experience all the way to the end. This game could of been so much more if not for the terrible game design decisions that held it back.

This game, while not so amazing as to warrant equal status as a Favorite Game, is very good as well. The gameplay has been improved upon from 2033 with the most dramatic being the addition of a non-lethal takedown option for fighting humans. The story continues from 2033 where you find that the  bad end from the original is the canonical one (T_T)\n\nReview for redux version\nUnlike the redux of 2033, the redux of Last Light doesn't really feel different at all. Graphical improvements, maybe, but outside of some mission layout adjustments, there aren't really any differences worthy of note. Honestly, the thing I noticed most is that a lot of the DLC achievements weren't ported over to the redux. Fewer things I have to do to 100% this game, I suppose, but otherwise, I really just feel like I'm replaying Last Light (original), not any sort of "new and improved" Last Light.\n\nAs for recommending this game? You can't buy the non-redux versions so that's not an issue here.

It's a bit linear, but I feel like the setting kind of excuses that a bit.  It's a bit short, but I figure it's best to leave your audience wanting more.  The stealth is competently done, though occasionally too easy, even in Survival Ranger Hardcore.  It is nice that there is, I believe only one forced stealth section and it is almost impossible to fail.  The combat is, again, almost too easy at times.  I found myself taking half a clip from a rifle to the chest and then taking out enemies with a single headshot.  Even the particularly challenging parts are mitigated considerably by the frequent autosaves.\n\nI want to say a bit about storytelling.  This game is, I feel, very well done in that department.  You can just run and gun your way through it, but stopping to listen to conversations can reveal a lot about the world.  If I have any complaints it's the large number of scripted sequences in the beggining.  It stops doing that quite so often as the game progresses, but still forces you to listen to unskippable dialogue fairly often.","July 21, 2015","true","28.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you are a certain type that doesn't leave a stone unturned, this game will probably go up in your top 10.\n\nThe other thing which makes you love it is the WEAPON SYSTEM. Not only is it well-designed, with the options to buy/customize or simply save up money(in our case, golden bullets), you are left with a series of choices every time you visit a shop. Will you trade off your current weapon so that you gain the advantage of a 6-shot shotgun or will you stick with your trusty revolver and believe in yourself to pick off your enemies with precision.\n\nLet's not forget this ground-breaking feature - the choice of going all out or simply playing it stealthily.\nYes, every level, doesn't matter if your enemy is human or beast, you are left with an option to either engage it head-on or just skillfully sneak past and save up some ammo and filters. You are always provided with a hidden path which will serve you as an advantage.\n\nThe STORY is neither impressive or dull. It hits that sweet spot. You are neither tired of the development of the plot or eager to know what the hell is going to happen in the next station. Indeed, there are many plot-twists but I won't spoil any, for the sake of the best experience.\n\nMORALITY CHOICES. Later on in-game, you will have to decide for yourself to either show revenge or forgiveness. Not only are those particular choices important for the ending but also murders and overseeing matter throught your entire playthrough - from beginning to ending.\n\nCHARACTERS. Unique and interesting, all in their own ways. Each interaction with them reminds you how different their world is from yours and always leave something for your to remember about them. Although, they did dull-down Ulman. He was quite the monkey-man in 2033, especially in the final missions.\n\nADDITIONAL MISSIONS INCLUDED. Do not think you are finished with the Metro. More content awaits you in the CHAPTERS section. Simply go in and press "Q" and experience totally new adventures from other points of view. Be a RED sniper securing a Nazi outpost, a hired gun to exterminate a Spider Nest, a Nazi heavy-weapons specialist, and finally my favourite, a fresh recruit, a ranger, who is supposed to manage his filters and ammo carefully, as there are no options to scavenge such outside your outpost - whatever you buy at the outpost, that will be your supplies for the oustide tread. In addition, the area which you are exploring is the Library from 2033.\n\n\nOverall, a great experience.","August 10, 2015","true","40.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Arthur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/","145 products in account","TL;DRA sequel to the well-acclaimed FPS set in the Metro 2033 universe. Highly recommended!\n+ Ambience\n+ Intensity\n+ Captivating story\n+ Solid gunplay\n+ Variety of weapons\n+ Great soundtrack\n- A bit linear\n- No manual save\n\nREVIEW\nMetro Last Light: Redux is a sequel to the FPS based on the novel called "Metro 2033" written by Dmitriy Glukhovsky. Rather than being a faithful "Metro 2034" adaptation, its action is centred on Artyom and is set a year after the events presented in the original.\n\nThe game is set in post-apocalyptical Moscow. Years after the nuclear war, its surface is still inhabitable due to excessive radiation. Moreover, it is infested with mutated beasts, including the Dark Ones. The remnants of humanity (divided as ever) live in the Moscow underground metro tunnels. Artyom, the protagonist, is officially a member of The Rangers. The action begins by the arrival of Khan, a very spiritual Ranger. He announces that one of the Dark Ones have survived the missile strike and that the mutant is key to the future of humanity. However, Colonel Miller, a seasoned Ranger, believes that the mutant is a threat and that it should be neutralised. Since Miller is the one who calls the shots, the hunt is on. Artyom and Anna, Miller's daughter and a gifted sniper, are sent on a mission to kill the Dark One.\n\nThe story captivates right from the start, especially if one enjoyed the original game and/or the novels. One of the game's main strengths is definitely the ambience – the player lives and breathes the events and even though the plot is quite linear, there are a few ways of playing the game. Whether one prefers a stealthy approach or going in guns blazing, the game is intense and enjoyable. Speaking of guns, there is a variety of weapons and gear available, including firearms, knives, grenades, etc. The gunplay feels solid and satisfying. There are countless dangers waiting for Artyom. Apart from the aforementioned monsters, there also are bandits, Communists (did I mention bandits?), and the Fourth Reich. The game is reasonably challenging and I have not noticed any problems with the AI.\n\nThe graphics are marvellous and it is easy to get lost in the portrayed world. The sounds are great and the soundtrack is memorable. Adding to the immersive experience, there is a "Ranger Mode" which disables the HUD. The player will also find hidden Artyom's journal pages throughout the game which add more depth to the story.\n\nAll in all, I strongly recommend this game not only to the Metro 2033 universum fans. It is a very well-made FPS with a great story and stunning visuals. A 9/10.\n\nP.S.

Redux version updates the game to latest engine with new graphical effects, some new animations, better optimization and contains all released DLC's.\nNow, I don't own the original version, so can't comment on that.\nThe game has great story, game play, characters, music and graphics. Everything you need from a great video game, and often metro feels like living, breathing real world. The game has system of choices, with consequences. Last Light got 2 different endings, both are done pretty well. although, I like good endings.\nGame play is great. Once again, stealth is easy and so does gunplay. You can play this with the style you want in most parts. Rambo or Sam Fisher, your choice.\nGame looks awesome, with good optimization. my 7770 can easily do 60fps on med/1080p(as with 2033 redux).\nBut the main great thing about this game is main story, mini-stories and mini-mini stores(weird). If you listen to NPC's, you will find some great small stories and some amusing ones. The main story is awesome and one of a kind, that I will never forget.\nMusic is the integral part of the game, and this game has some of the best soundtracks you will ever hear.\n\nUpdate:\nAfter 100% completing this game, I think this is best game I've played in 2014.\nThere are 9 different DLC chapters, and all of them are awesome.\nFaction Pack contains three missions, where one is shoot everything up, second is stealth mission and last one is scavenging mission in The Library(best DLC IMO).\nTower Pack contains an AI challenge maps. really frustrating, but once you complete it, you'll feel victorious.\nDeveloper Pack contains Shooting Gallery, Mutant Museum where you can observe NPCs and AI Arena, where you can make anything in game, fight each other. Really funny sometimes. It also contains the spider lair mission. where you get to burn spiders. yum.\nChronicles Pack contains little missions where you play as Anna, Pavel, Ulman and Khan. The mission involving Ulman and Khan has some of the most funny moments in Game.\n\nHighly Recommended. 10/10","September 5, 2014","true","34.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

I just have to warn you it doesn't change the way the AI react, nor the amount of AI in the game. It can get frustrating having to scavenge three entire rooms to acquire enough ammo to kill one enemy, which is the case with Ranger Hardcore: Survival.

If you read nothing else in this review, PLAY THE GAME...\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing. I almost disliked some of the combat simply because I was too busy looking around at how beautiful and immersive the environment is. Note I said "almost." The combat is simply too good to hate. It's challenging, but reactive. I really feel like I'm firing a crudely put together air rifle!\n\nNow I can't write a review here without going into the negatives however. The pace is slow. Theres alot of crawling around and staying out of the light. You may enjoy that aspect, but I'm not too much a fan of stealth games.\n\nNo really. I can't think of any more negatives to put down about this game! It's going right up there on my top 10 games of all time list along side Metro 2033! Absolutely stunning.

The actions you make throughout the game, be it your decision or the writers, can be so saddening and enlightening. My only issue with this game, would be the morale system. I was in no need 'forgiving' the entire way through the game, so I didn't think I'd get the good ending (there is two endings). upon further research, I learned that so much as not going in some specific room can spoil your chance at getting the good ending. I have viewed both, and they're both beautiful in their own sense, and I can't think of which one is better. Each ending has their own bits and pieces that are so special.

The messages in the game are powerful. The gunplay is refined, the survival gameplay feels realistic, the enemies are interesting, and there were some action scenes (such as the Final Fight) that were extraordinarily well-done. The coolest part of the game, though, is the world that it creates. The Metro truly does feel like a real world as you walk around in it; it feels lived-in, and what an underground civilization would actually look like. You can meet Russian Nazis, Reds, and heroes from the last game, discovering that the Metro is in a three-way war. You can travel to Metro city-states and explore them, and that was super cool. Also, if you want a challenge, this game will fulfill your needs.

If you have played the first one such as me, You will begin with a exact follow up of the ending. If you haven't I suggest you play the first one instead of this one. Now then onto the review\n\nStory\nThe story is fantastic it offers a bleak and psychological view of a world that has been nuked at the heart of Russia. I don't want to say much, But it is a constant fight between 3 main factions in small underground tunnels known simply as the Metro. The game itself takes about 8-9 hours depending on if you play the extra missions or not.\n\nGameplay\nIt is smooth and flows quite well, The shooting and etc won't keep you bored for all of the missions. I spent most of my time taking in the scenery while shooting the occasional hunting packs of the Watchmen.\n\nMy personal thoughts of the game is less of an fps and more of a psychological joyride once you meet theDark One It will give you a more bigger vision of the world of Metro and what has happened to Artyom both as a child and the passin periods of Metro 2033 and Last Light. Yeah I recommend it the enemies are all unique and difficult in there own way and help set the mood of this amazing must have game/","April 2","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And a ton of fun!...but not worth full price. The game game has a lot of mechanic related improvements over 2033 Redux and is a lot less buggy. It also has a longer campaion, but it just doesn't deliver as good of a quality of story as the first one does, nore does it really seem to care about your actions like the first. Let me ewxplain:\n\n1+) Mechanics - Like 2033 Redux, Last Light Redux uses the same HUD display that can be removed based on the style you choose to play on, and no real changes have been made to that. The real improvements have come in the stealth system wich is noticalby more advanced (or at least more sensative) and which does a better job of really kepping you on your toes as you play. Its honestly a nice improvement.\n\n2+)Buggs - While this game is by no means perfect, a lot of the buggs from the first are no longer an issue. Don'e get me wrong, there are bugs, and if you look at the community forum you'll see about 10k ways to fix them all, but its better than 2033 Redux.\n\n3+/-) The campaion - In last light the campaion is much longer than in 2033 (about 2x) and there is another probably 0.5x in bonus material added on as well in the main menue. That said, the campaion gets a bit flat about half way through and at some point starts dragging along. It's still good (a lot better than some big tittles out there) but it just isn't as good as the first and that's kinda a let down coming from playing 2033 Redux.\n\n4-) The Moral Point System - Alright, I'll be honest, this system was annoying in 2033 Redux as well, but the issue here is that the longer campaion means there is more of these points to look out for and more ways to screw them up. It also doesn't seem to matter too much at the end as there is still almost the exact same play sequence regardless of ending, just a different 20sec clip plays after it. Also, while talking about this, the ending doesn't care how you played. Regardless of if you went sneaking or if you went guns blazing, you get the same fight sequence (event for both endings) and while it is crucial to the plot...it just seems sorta cheap. The game reards you the whole time for playing a certian way, and then doesn't really care at the end. It just takes some of the fun out of it.\n\nFinal thoughts on this game are that one should try to get it when its on sale or part of a combo with 2033 Redux. Its not bad, but I don't really feel its worth the full price they charge for it.","June 3","true","35.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Much better optimized that the original Last Light. One thing I noticed it that the lighting itself seems to be toned down--less dynamic? Even with maxed tesselation (which for some reason even if Crysis 2 and 3 affected lighting) it seems toned down. That's okay since playability seems to be king here because it has to work on weaker console hardware. Even advanced PhysX isn't as bad on AMD hardware as it had been in the past. Maybe we'll actually be able to just use better CPUs instead of needing Nvidia hardware. As far as the original Metro 2033? I can only run that now on my 7970. My old 6870 couldn't run it that well which is one reason I opted not to play it much until a year or so ago and held off again once I heard a redux was coming.\n\nNot the upgrade PC gamers with $3000 rigs wanted, but definately the one guys with $400 gpus wanted.","August 26, 2014","true","26.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathlessOne/recommended/287390/","DeathlessOne","Death","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathlessOne/","95 products in account","First, with the Pros:\n\nTrue to the games' description by the author, this is a horror survival game. Progress is determinded by how well you can survive. Elements of stealth, reconnaisance, resource utrilization and conservation, atmospheric and lighting will be key in exploration and survival.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straight-forward. Hand-holding is minimal, and the challenge progression is non-linear. Even on amateur difficulty level,Metro Last Light requires considerable skill and attention to detail to muster even the very first parts of the game. Its' a good primer for these well versed in first person shooters. On highrt levels of difficulty, the key is stealth, frugality in expending resources and firepower, and speed. Of note is the realism bhrought on by environmental factors such as lighting ( notes for stealth), radioactivity, uninhabitable atmosphere ( reminds you to keep check on filters and inventory), and the various monsters you'll face in-game. Each is a challenge unto its' own, blended into a perfect blend of horror.\n\nThis, in my opinion, is one of the best horror survival games I've played in a while, and compared to the Resident Evil franchise from Capcom, Metro Last Light just stole my personal record of a horror survival game from Resident Evil.\n\nThe graphics options are modest, and a recent gaming rig with a mid-range GPU should be able to handle the game on Low to Medium, without appreciable loss in visual quality. For these with high-end NVIDIA GPUs, turn on Advanced PhySX for realistic physics. You'll want to leave this "Disabled" on AMD GPUs and APUS. VRAM is also significant on Ultra Setting Details and resolutions above 2k-4k.\n\nGame length: Adequate and balanced. Jump right in and survive. Its' all that matters in the Metro.\n\nCaveats: On some scenery, persistent flickering of textures may be prevalent and at times, intermittent. May cause visual strain. Exasberated by playing the game in Stereoscopic 3D. Recent updates and patches have reduced this problem. However, its' still present.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivRoK/recommended/287390/","DivRoK","DivRoK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivRoK/","433 products in account","For those that weren't aware of Metro: Last Light its first time around, the game is a direct sequel to Metro 2033, with the plot being set forth by the last moments of 2033. Russia has been decimated by nuclear war, and the only way people were able to survive was to turn the underground metro system into makeshift settlements. Above ground, animals have mutated into horrific beasts, and mysterious psychic beings called the Dark Ones lurk both above ground and below. In Metro 2033: Last Light the monsters aren’t the only danger, as different factions from Neo-Nazis to Commies and beyond are all duking it out for a doomsday device in a civil war for control of Russia’s remains. It’s up to Artyom, the player character, to learn more about the still-mysterious Dark Ones and try to keep relative peace throughout the metro. I really enjoyed the narrative. While the plot itself isn’t terribly original, the world and characters are expanded in the way a good movie sequel grows things not simply for growth’s sake, but to make the player feel even more like they’re in a living, breathing place.\nWhat makes Last Light shine isn’t how many things go boom or how many monsters get pumped full of lead. I mean there’s definitely action, and when it’s there it is satisfying, but where the game series as a whole really succeeded was in creating a palpable atmosphere dense with despair, anxiety, and powerlessness. In some ways Last Light improved on the immersion of Metro 2033 through fully first person cut scenes, expanding the game’s universe, and greatly improved graphics that brought out each spiderweb and puddle of mud.\nWith the narratives and worlds so tied together it seemed a bit jarring that gameplay took such a sudden change in direction. Thankfully herein lies, in my opinion, the biggest positive about Last Light’s re-release treatment. Now fans of both styles can be happy, as the game lets people choose from the get-go whether they’d like to play the more action-oriented style of the original, or boost up enemy damage and scale back the amount of resources available to play in the style of 2033.\nUnfortunately some of the other improvements that Redux boasts end up being largely inconsequential. While graphics technology has improved noticeably since the franchise’s freshman effort in 2010, I really didn’t notice anything looking particularly better in this version than in the Last Light of 2013. I’m sure that if compared side by side there’s probably a few nicer textures and models here and there, but all in all tech just hasn’t developed enough since then to make the visuals a viable reason to upgrade. Don’t, however, confuse that for me being displeased with the way things look. Though the game takes place in underground tunnels and barren wastelands, the game still manages to keep the screen from turning into the brown soup that so many desolate games do.\nThe art direction helps things too. Everything from the weapons to the underground "buildings" feel ready to fall apart at any moment, and the various people drinking around fires, shopping, and just generally going about their daily lives give the settlements in particular an organic, personable vibe that pull you into the world of Metro that much more. So while none of this is particularly different from the original release to Redux, it’s still pretty darned good.\nWhether or not you find Metro: Last Light Redux worth the money is going to depend entirely on what you’re buying it for. If you’re someone who’s never played the game, or if you’re someone like me that liked 2033 but didn’t appreciate the pacing changes the sequel brought, then yes, pull the trigger. The game becomes much more of a survival-horror title with the new available options, and if you’re new you can try both styles and decide for yourself. Otherwise, there’s really no reason to prefer the original over this remastering. The audio visual improvements are modest, and the added content of the DLCs are relatively miniscule. All in all, I myself had a great time with the title, and the Metro franchise is still one nuclear winter I never want to turn to spring.","March 9","true","2.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

One is M:LL as a game, the other is Redux as an upgrade. M:LL first.\n\nM:LL is the sequel to Metro 2033 (based on a fantastic book by Dmitry Glukhovsky) which was a decent but not great FPS. It did many things fantastically well, the oppressive atmosphere and incredible tension, while falling a bit flat on storytelling and shooter mechanics. It was still a shining example of amazing immersion and lack of hand-holding. Russian post-apocalyptica at it's finest.\n\nM:LL picks up after the canon ending to 2033 (the one from the book) and delivers a vastly superior experience to 2033. Everything is far more polished. The combat, weapons and gunplay in general is more accurate, visceral and satisfying. The level design and various settings are far more varied and well designed and the pacing of both the action, the storytelling and the characters are far more polished this time around.\n\nIt's still very much a linear shooter, but I've found myself backtracking to where I started entirely by accident as I've explored and found various different paths to get to the same objective, which is fairly impressive for an underground tunnel setting. There's plenty of hidden nooks and crannies around the place, with goods and encounters you would otherwise miss.\n\nI love the weapons. I really truly do. They give the impression of mostly cobbled together and improvised weaponry, further reinforced by the delightful customization system. Two barrel shotgun? Pfft, FOUR BARRELS! Have some of that, hah! There's quite a bit of variance within just a single weapon, with silencers, scopes and other mods and each weapon is fairly unique to start with. They all seem to have a very satisfying heft to them as well. Of course, four barrels at point blank most certainly should have that.\n\nThe characters are far better presented in this game than 2033. Voice acting has improved and so has the writing. This game really seems to shine now that the story has been written for presentation as a game, rather than how in 2033 they had to condense and adapt a book to an action/horror fps game. The story is well told and will take you all over the Metro system and let you see and incredible amount of gorgeous locations.\n\nSpeaking of gorgeous... this game is amazing in terms of visuals and graphics. I can't tell you how it performs on lower end systems, but except for during one particular level (full of fire and smoke) I never noticed frame drops on a GTX 780ti with everything but the in-game anti-aliasing option turned to max. I think one of the reasons M:LL is so amazingly immersive and delivers such a fantastic atmosphere is largely due to the lighting. It's flat out gorgeous. The lightbeams from friendly and hostile npcs and mounted lights, combined with the fantastic fog/smoke effects makes for an impressive sight. Especially when you take into account the moisture on your gas mask, the ambient lighting and the flares. This is truly an example of PC Graphics superiority.\n\nThe game effortlessly switches between action and stealth where you feel like a proper Stalker/Ranger in charge of the situation, and with breathless terror as you're just another prey animal in a horrifying world of predators. While LL didn't provide the same level of helpless pants-wetting terror as the Library did for me in 2033, there's no denying that it goes the distance and has nothing to be ashamed of in that regard.\n\nSo, judging it solely on its merits as a game I would easily give M:LL a 9 or 10 out of 10.\n\n... however, I can't quite do that. There's serious technical issues and I suspect it's from the Redux upgrade so let's take a look at that.\n\n2033 Redux and LL Redux is basically a GOTY pack including all the DLCs, slightly retuning some encounters and mechanics (and vastly upgrading the graphics in the case of 2033) and upgrading the entire graphics engine to 64bit. This has not been a painless transition, sadly. Quite a few of us initially couldn't even run either of the games, or couldn't get past intro sequences or crashed incessantly. The technical forums are to this day full of threads with issues and it's not entirely certain they'll all be resolved.\n\nI've beaten both, but LL in particular had a tendency to crash my video driver and I've had to redo quite a few areas. At its worst, I could go so low as just 5-10 minutes of playtime and at its best I experienced 45 minutes before I had to start up again. Normally I'd attribute this to an issue on my end, but the technical forums show this is quite wide-spread.\n\nAs for the Redux itself, is it worth it? Should it just have been a free patch? I'd say it actually is worth it. It's quite similar to a GOTY edition as far as I'm concerned and the content, graphics and game updates are fairly priced as far as I'm concerned. This is giving one of the best FPS series/settings out there a new lease on life and I'm all for it.\n\nSo in conclusion, do I recommend this game? Oh yes, definitely.\n\nGraphics: Top notch.\nGunplay: Top notch.\nWriting/Storytelling: Good.\nLength: I think I racked up about eight hours total for the campaign, without DLC missions.\nOverall: 8/10, point subtracted for technical issues.\n\nBuy it, but be aware that you may have technical issues.","September 16, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Level design is excellent with great atmosphere, and great story about life and moral. Metro Last Light is the only FPS that I considered to be worthy of best shooter of 2013.\n\nAbout this Redux version:\nHowever, Last Light Redux is more of a complete edition than a redux. It's pretty much the same game with full DLC that are either too short or uninteresting, and the changes to graphic are insignificant (even none at all to some people). The only improvement is, the game has been optimized and the performance is much better than the original version.\nI'm not recommend this "Redux" for people who already owned original Last Light. But if you have trouble running the original version smoothly, you can in this one, but best get it when it's on sale.\n\nSo, thumbs-up for this amazing game, but thumbs-down for a Redux that should have been free for people who owned the original game.","September 4, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Achievements are pretty fun too, especially the ones where you have to go through a level without raising any alarms (or even killing anyone, in some cases).\nGraphics, storyline, and gameplay are all solid.

There are many words to use, most of them suitable, but you truly must play this game to understand why I say them! These words are 'depressing, heart crushing, brick-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, recidivistic' and so on. No, I don't mean repetitive when I mean recidivism - this game just makes you relapse into negative behavior of the previous three words. There are reasons for this below:\n\nPros: Great story! Fantastic and ended beautifully! Good and bad ending!\nMultiple endings! All good actions take you to the good ending, you screw up though and you get the bad one!\nDifficult on harder difficulties. I know this sounds like a given, but I mean REALLY difficult. As in, you're not stealthing, you're not doing it right.\nThe little details. Again, may seem rather tedious and stupid, but in actuality, it helps bring this game to life! The effort put into this game was astronomical!\nGraphically amazing! The art design was also flawless!\nMost of the sound was VERY good! Most of which.\n\nCons: Bad ending happens under the smallest screw ups, one of the options even became a meme 'Said yes to stripper, got bad ending'. You'll get to that in game, and deal with it then!\nGameplay can be a bit tedious in the early game! It picks up though\nGetting lost from bad level design. Happens every once in a while.\nGuns sound terrible! Unless silenced, but loud weapons sounded horrible! You'll favor the silenced pistol most of the game if you enjoy good sounding and looking guns.\n\nThis game can be summed up as good gameplay, but flawed never the less! The story was very well written and envoked every emotion it wanted to when it wanted to! Great game, but sometimes I feel as if it was trying TOO hard to make me feel sad. But that was one scene in which I won't spoil. If you don't find the scene, it means it was just me! I wasn't too sure of it though, so I didn't include it in the review! My final verdict for this game is:\n\n7/10\n\nIt's a solid game! Great even! But it has it's flaws, but for the price it's currently going for, it's surely something that you should have in your library!","May 27, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly recommend to play Metro 2033 and/or read the books the games are basing on, before you fire this baby up. You do can play Last light just from scratch, but it would be better to at least know a bit about the lore. The game doesn't really explain a lot. Besides, Metro 2033 is great so go play it :p\n\nSince i would spoil the ending of MEtro 2033, i probably say nothing, The story does picks up after one certain ending of Metro 2033 and follows again Artyom and the Black ones. You will meet old faces and new enemies. The endings are satisfying enough for me.\nThe plot, as a whole, is again a big goose chase throughout the metros of moscow, but this time a lot more on the surface than in 2033. In the end it was entertaining to follow and it never bored me. Especially the upcoming war between the Nazis and the Reds is very interesting handled. Anyway go check for yourselves :)\n\nThe game mechanics are basically the same. A lot of emphasis on sneaking or else you are screwed. At least on harder difficulties. You do can go and run and gun if you please. Read my 2033 review for more details on the gameplay. You should play that game anyway first.\n\nThe raphics look very good. Dark and dirty. Just like an old not maintained metro should look like. With Last Light they put more emphasis on the outside areas and created some very interesting areas. The new storm and rain effects look very good. THe swamps and the wastelands look fabulous. For a nuclear wasteland that is. But if that would happen... yea, i can see that it would look like this.\n\nThe guns are much the same. Some new additions here and there. Some new attachments, but overall the same custom made weapons and the russian AK's. The roster is big and somehow very freaking. Each weapon feels different and the kickback is high. So only shortbursts are allowed :)\n\nSo nothing really much to say. The game doesn't really include many new features. A driveable rail car for a mission and some weapons. The graphics are mostly the same. The enemies are mostly the same. So why should you buy it? Well for the great plot and the badass atmosphere. The game gives you a good impression of how helpess the peole there are and how dangerous this all can be. So i really recommend buy that game together with 2033.\n\n\n\n","September 2, 2015","true","13.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is probably my all time favorite game ever (having played games since the Atari and Nintendo days this is saying something). I would recommend this game to anyone and especially to those that enjoy a FPS with a GOOD story.\n\nOn a side note the books are equally as good but very different from the game story wise.

MLLR is less survival horror and more conventional shooter, and that’s a shame. That said, however, it’s still an atmospheric game. The Moscow subway, and the desolate surface, are realistically rendered and brought to life by some impressive creature design. There’s a good range of environments and the gameplay varies to some extent, although it remains a standard shooter at heart. The story is more developed than most and is bolstered by good voice acting. There are also some nice set-pieces and dramatic cut scenes. It’s also a shame, however, that there is very little humour. The combat is challenging at times (Survival mode – haven’t played it on Spartan yet) but is never frustrating. The controls, however, can be annoying at times, especially when using the lighter/way-finder. There are also a few bugs related to gas mask filter changes. Overall, however, MLLR is a fantastic-looking and absorbing game, even though it lacks the tension of the first. 4/5","November 15, 2015","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great gameplay, story, and graphics. Not that graphics matter, but the highly polished quality definetely makes the game much more immersive than what it already is.\n\nIt also has a TON of content. For example you will find a wide variety of weapons, each customizable and upgradable in it's own way, each with it's own "feel". The extra DLC content is awesome, not only does it give you another 12+ hours of gameplay, it also allows you to play as characters you encounter in the main story providing more of an insight on this dark cold world created by Dmitry Glukhovsky.\n\nI stronly recommend playing the game in Ranger mode which makes this game even more immersive and realistic, not to mention very challenging.\n\nExtra: Steam says I have only 2.5 hours on record but that's because I played this game mostly offline. I've actually spent over 60 hours on this bad boy. Well worth the $4.99 tag. That's about 8 cents an hour!\n\n\n10/10","November 11, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first one, Metro 2033, is also great but they really streamlined things in this game. The game can be frustratingly difficult at times depending on the difficulty you choose which is refreshing nowadays. The stealth is spot on and allows for entire levels to done without firing a single bullet if you wish, or you can go the other way and just run and gun....but you will quickly run out of ammo and be in a very bad place. There are game modes that will give more ammo drops in the game which will allow you to just run around spraying bullets if you wish but if want to do that there are other games that will fit better in my opinion. This is a resource management game where you don't know whats going to happen next but you need to be ready for it so you dont die. The game is not for the faint of heart as there will be multiple parts when you just want to hide in that nice little hole you've found and never leave. Great graphics and gun varieties allowing you choose how you fight in the metro of post-apocalyptic Russia.","September 14, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only does the game look completely beautiful and has voice acting and subtitles for almost every major language out there; the game is wonderfully paced.  Levels vary from human enemies to expository stations to explore to scrambling surface runs where you have limited air filters, to exploring dark dank underground tunnels, side passages, and catacombs.  Combine all of that with a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good (IMO) story of a bleak post-apocalyptic world, I give 5 stars.\n\nWeapon handling is superb, and all the weapons are very customizable.  Ranger mode is the true way to play this game, where you have no hud whatsoever.  You can even beat the game without killing a single human unless forced to (An accomplishment that I'm proud of having.  Although, that achievement is only in the OG version, not the redux, so if you try to go for that, get both)\n\nThe redux version comes with all of the DLC, increased performance, some increased options, more playstyles (The gung-ho action-y OG last light, or a more survival oriented experience based on both the books and the first game), and is cross platform for all OSes.\n\nI definitely recommend to anyone, for this is the best pure singleplayer fps in a long time, and most immersive FPS to date.  Alien: Isolation is also good, but it isn't really much of an fps, and same with the Deus Ex titles; those are less fps and more Horror and RPG, respectively.\n\n","October 31, 2015","true","29.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first one, Metro 2033, is also great but they really streamlined things in this game. The game can be frustratingly difficult at times depending on the difficulty you choose which is refreshing nowadays. The stealth is spot on and allows for entire levels to done without firing a single bullet if you wish, or you can go the other way and just run and gun....but you will quickly run out of ammo and be in a very bad place. There are game modes that will give more ammo drops in the game which will allow you to just run around spraying bullets if you wish but if want to do that there are other games that will fit better in my opinion. This is a resource management game where you don't know whats going to happen next but you need to be ready for it so you dont die. The game is not for the faint of heart as there will be multiple parts when you just want to hide in that nice little hole you've found and never leave. Great graphics and gun varieties allowing you choose how you fight in the metro of post-apocalyptic Russia.","September 14, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Metro 2033's stealth parts were mainly optional, I could run and gun my way through with ease. Last Light on the other hand stealth parts were much more dubious, once spotted its very easy for the enemy to over run and out flank your position. The game also had many more boss fights with larger breeds of monster, something the first one desperately lacked considering the main boss was one of the demons which you didnt face until the end. The karma meter in the game was also a nice touch, there were atleast  6 different instances where people surrendered to you and you decided their fate. I chose to execute most of them. (If you let an enemy go on the battle field in real life chances are you will end up fighting them again sooner or later) and atleast 2 instances to help innocent civilians escape their demise. The meter also effects the outcome of the game, though you cant tell what side of the meter you are on. I found myself also repeating chapters more than first as well, i.e not having enough air filters to last through long tough fights, or a broken mask coming into the wasteland. The only thing i felt it lacked was the sense of exploration the first had. Considering your in the metro more in this one that came as no surpise. Keys for locked objects were harder to find, and there were more boxes with supplies hidden in them as well.The weapons were also much more tailored to your play style, the addition of the RPK, Valve Rifle, and Automatic shotgun added a much more intense combat experience should you choose it.  Overall, to me it was much better than Metro 2033 and definately worth getting if you were a fan of the first.\n\nThanks for reading!","June 15, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And you're just happy you're out of it.\n\nWhen running for your life, for example,  they don't really indicate that well where you have to go. But your feelings tell you to go to certain ways, and that way is the exact way they want you to take. They're slight hints, knowing that you'd run that way.

It generally clocks at around 10-15 hours, depending on how good you are, what game mode you play, and which difficulty you chose.\n\nPROS:\n\n- The setting is unique and very interesting.\n- Very immersive, the sound and level design is top notch.\n- The weapons are very cool and customizable.\n- You can customize your gameplay experience. At the beginning of the game, you choose between Spartan and Survival mode. These drastically change the gameplay experience; Spartan gives you more ammo and supplies for run and gunning, while Survival gives less ammo and supplies, forcing you to be more careful and play stealthy. I personally prefer Survival since it fits the setting and tone of the game a lot more.\n- The stealth is very fun and well done. It's certainly not Splinter Cell or MGS, but it's good enough.\n- The story is actually pretty good.\n- There's a morality system, and it's not up in your face. It's good.\n\nCONS:\n\n- They throw ♥♥♥♥ and boobs at you randomly. I mean, I like them just as much as the next hetero dude, but the way they did it. It was just so... juvenile. Disappointing.

There are many words to use, most of them suitable, but you truly must play this game to understand why I say them! These words are 'depressing, heart crushing, brick-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, recidivistic' and so on. No, I don't mean repetitive when I mean recidivism - this game just makes you relapse into negative behavior of the previous three words. There are reasons for this below:\n\nPros: Great story! Fantastic and ended beautifully! Good and bad ending!\nMultiple endings! All good actions take you to the good ending, you screw up though and you get the bad one!\nDifficult on harder difficulties. I know this sounds like a given, but I mean REALLY difficult. As in, you're not stealthing, you're not doing it right.\nThe little details. Again, may seem rather tedious and stupid, but in actuality, it helps bring this game to life! The effort put into this game was astronomical!\nGraphically amazing! The art design was also flawless!\nMost of the sound was VERY good! Most of which.\n\nCons: Bad ending happens under the smallest screw ups, one of the options even became a meme 'Said yes to stripper, got bad ending'. You'll get to that in game, and deal with it then!\nGameplay can be a bit tedious in the early game! It picks up though\nGetting lost from bad level design. Happens every once in a while.\nGuns sound terrible! Unless silenced, but loud weapons sounded horrible! You'll favor the silenced pistol most of the game if you enjoy good sounding and looking guns.\n\nThis game can be summed up as good gameplay, but flawed never the less! The story was very well written and envoked every emotion it wanted to when it wanted to! Great game, but sometimes I feel as if it was trying TOO hard to make me feel sad. But that was one scene in which I won't spoil. If you don't find the scene, it means it was just me! I wasn't too sure of it though, so I didn't include it in the review! My final verdict for this game is:\n\n7/10\n\nIt's a solid game! Great even! But it has it's flaws, but for the price it's currently going for, it's surely something that you should have in your library!","May 27, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mayby not with the same amount of horror but its action packed. A lovely game for Metro fans like me.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Metro Last Light redux is very smooth, you can see that 4a optimized the experience for some lower end pc`s. Even on a high end pc i can notice the difference, i get about 10-20 fps more when playing the redux version of Last Light on my gaming pc.\n\nAlso the Ai has been improved, even though i have found the stealth being good but very easy. Using stealth in this game was no challenge for me and i could very easily walk infront of enamies without being noticed. As long as you crouch and stay a bit in the shadows everything is fine. Also you may only talk once to a npc and then its like they ignore you, its very annoying when you want to replay what they have said.\n\nAs said before the gameplay is smooth and when fighting against the ai they prove to be a challenge.\n\nAlso the game has beautiful weapon designs and mechanics, it really fits in the lore. The dlc is great, it gives you different perspectives from the situation in moscow, you can play as a sparta soldier etc. .\n\nStory complains (minor spoiler)\nAs far as my complains about the story are is that the final battle was way too short for me. Its basicly saying that i like trains and i get a train smacked in my face. The little defence scene was done great but enamies that were retreating were unkillable. The ending scene was really done right though.\n\nSome missions were really boring, just basicly kill and advance.\n\nThe ending system is done well too.\n\nMy advice\nIts worth every penny to buy Metro Last Light after youve played 2033. Especially if you like to have a scary atmosphere with some nice survival elements. This game gives you awnsers on the open ending in 2033 and comes back to it. You really get convinced youve done something bad in 2033.\n\nThe story keeps you wanting to know what happens next en there are some nice twists.\n\nSo to shorten it up: smooth, great story, engaging, great graphics and a large amount of content ( about 10h campaign and 8+h dlc) for a singleplayer game.\n\nNot so scary but its still intense,\n8/10","November 23, 2015","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The lighting is beautiful, the palette is suitably brown, and the graphics are pretty clean - and as someone who plays his games with a headset, every little rustle and scratch of the ambient (or enemy) creatures of post-apocalyptic Russia is pretty situationally a good head♥♥♥♥.\nHowever, it's sort of one of those personal petpeeves that the game seems to very arbitrarily decide when it is you're going to be able to look down at the rest of your body - and also when you're going to have a proper shadow, let alone a fully-textured one - and also when that one guy at the gun range in the very beginning of the intro is going to have a revolver that actually completely renders in his hand.\n\nOh well, I guess.

Redux takes place back in the metro and you once again play as Artyom though this time you're. Along the way you'll meet a familiar cast of characters such as Khan or Miller and you've got some new guys thrown in like Moskvin and Anna.The game has 30 different chapters each ranging from about 10 minutes at the shortest and about 30-ish minutes at the longest. All of these chapters total up to about 10 hours of full gameplay in Redux. The game itself isn't much of an upgrade and honestly I didn't notice any glaring differences from normal Last Light and the Redux version.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=572961406\nRedux has the same systems as the 2033 Redux and really the games aren't that different in anything but the story. The main part about getting the Redux for Last Light is that it has all of the DLC with it. Each and every one of the DLC's are phenomenal and adds plenty of content for the price you pay. The characters in redux are mostly the same you've encountered throughout the series so far. The best part that makes this game so good is the levels in the Metro. This is where it took a huge improvement from 2033 and shifted into it's own sort of direction;well,this and the story that is. The levels are each precisely made for either stealth or action,much like the first game,but here you get a more open feeling even though the game is significantly more linear than 2033. The story,however, is incredibly. Metro LL is the climactic end to the Metro duo and it goes off with a bang to rival the best of them. You go through the game with an overhanging sense of this being the finale. This is the battle that decides the fate of the metro,and whoever controls D6 survives while the others wither and die. From the moment you wake in the first level to the moment your rope finally comes to an end you'll be rooting for the Artyom and,more importantly, the Polis Rangers as a whole.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=573044076\nLast Light is so highly-regarded here because it does something I believe that most games nowadays have trouble doing:Ending. Lots of times today you finish a game only to sit there like, that's it? Last Light finishes the series in such a way that, no matter which ending you get, you'll still feel a sense of closure to the series. Both endings are very unique and the ending you do get is decided on a scale of good to bad. You get the "bad" ending by default but the "good" ending is more of a secret on how to unlock. Make sure you do lot's of nice things like not killing people when you can and donating to the poor and you should have this ending locked down. Metro Last Light is a phenomenal ending to the series that will leave you craving more and, due to this being the redux, you get all the DLC with the base game so finishing Artyom's story doesn't necessarily mean that's it.\n\nTL;DRLast Light is a wild ride through the bombed out metro's of Moscow filled with loads of gun-slinging, mutant-stomping, totally badass gameplay that lets the series go out just how it should:With a bang.\n\nIf you enjoyed this writing and want to read more of such reviews,check out my steam curator page at Mudkips Gaming","December 10, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mayby not with the same amount of horror but its action packed. A lovely game for Metro fans like me.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of Metro Last Light redux is very smooth, you can see that 4a optimized the experience for some lower end pc`s. Even on a high end pc i can notice the difference, i get about 10-20 fps more when playing the redux version of Last Light on my gaming pc.\n\nAlso the Ai has been improved, even though i have found the stealth being good but very easy. Using stealth in this game was no challenge for me and i could very easily walk infront of enamies without being noticed. As long as you crouch and stay a bit in the shadows everything is fine. Also you may only talk once to a npc and then its like they ignore you, its very annoying when you want to replay what they have said.\n\nAs said before the gameplay is smooth and when fighting against the ai they prove to be a challenge.\n\nAlso the game has beautiful weapon designs and mechanics, it really fits in the lore. The dlc is great, it gives you different perspectives from the situation in moscow, you can play as a sparta soldier etc. .\n\nStory complains (minor spoiler)\nAs far as my complains about the story are is that the final battle was way too short for me. Its basicly saying that i like trains and i get a train smacked in my face. The little defence scene was done great but enamies that were retreating were unkillable. The ending scene was really done right though.\n\nSome missions were really boring, just basicly kill and advance.\n\nThe ending system is done well too.\n\nMy advice\nIts worth every penny to buy Metro Last Light after youve played 2033. Especially if you like to have a scary atmosphere with some nice survival elements. This game gives you awnsers on the open ending in 2033 and comes back to it. You really get convinced youve done something bad in 2033.\n\nThe story keeps you wanting to know what happens next en there are some nice twists.\n\nSo to shorten it up: smooth, great story, engaging, great graphics and a large amount of content ( about 10h campaign and 8+h dlc) for a singleplayer game.\n\nNot so scary but its still intense,\n8/10","November 23, 2015","true","20.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why not just English accents? At least now you got the option to change it to Russian voiceovers, but sometimes there are several voices going on and you'll have no idea what one of them is saying.\n\nNo borderless window mode.\n\nUnskipable intro (unless you mess with some of the files).\n\nIf you get discovered through the stealth parts, everyone suddenly knows where you are.\n\nThe children voiceacting are cringeworthy.\n... I really can't find any other bad parts about this game, the good really outweights the bad. It's a great sequel to an already great game.\nOnly huge gripe I have about this game is that I tried really hard to not play as a 'bad guy' yet I got the bad ending, despite having done many good deeds throughout the game.\nAs for the horror elements; it wasn't quite as scary as the first game. Perhaps only because I knew what to expect after the first game. The game isn't horror in its core, but it tells the story with horror elements.\nIf you liked Metro 2033, you will definitely like Metro Last Light.","March 29","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To those of you looking to buy I sudgest doing research before you purchase to avoid being like my first statement. There have also been a few potential solutions on the forums for getting the games working. Even if you do though there are many people having issues with frames. The simple solution to use if you are having issues with frames is to setup vsync through your Nvidia control pannel. This will not* correct the Bushes of doom unfortunately so avoid walking into them in combat. This launch of the Redux games was mainly intended for XB and PS, boo i know. Many of the player base for Metro had already played the original games. I bought 2033 for a reimagined and updated experience for one of my favorite games I only purchase LL redux because I beleive in supporting the devs so this story continues I didnt notice too many times things were different. I would like to beleive that we are being used as essentially a beta test for the 4a engine. The 4a engine is a whole new engine from what the original LL used contrary to what many people will tell you. If I am correct these people having issues with playing the game will not be having the same issue for the next installment of the story.\n\nThis game was beautiful, scary, and it truly has one of the best stories in any game. 11/10\nSide note cut these Devs some slack a lot are still in Ukraine which if you didnt know looks like it might get invaded here soon.","August 29, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Were the Dark Ones really sent here to save us all, and is this the last of the Angels? I suppose you'll have to play the game to find out!\n\nMetro: Last Light Redux is a technical update from the original game which features improved texture sizes and even some additional content as well as all DLC released for the original game. Almost anybody who isn't adeptly aware of everything in the game will more than likely not be able to distinguish the differences, and that's understandable.\n\nI love this series and its other medium, It's based on a series of novels which tell the tale of Earth and mroe specifically Moscow Russia following the events of a Nuclear Winter. 2033 introduced us to this world, and one year later we have the events which unfold in Last Light. Where Khan finds a child of the race which Artyum foolishly destroyed, and it's up to Artyum to restore or destroy the balance for the next game.\n\nThe game has been updated, refined and developed by 4A, and it's developed by Russians based on a Russian story. The level of detail is such of that, that no two play-throughs are the same. I can say this confidently, as I really have lost count of how many times I've completed the series. The weapon choice is unique, diverse and generous, and you more than likely won't get to use every weapon in a single playthrough, The environments are the best part of the series, they're so immersive you could get lost and of you'd be fooling to not appreciate these environments.\n\nIt should also be noted that the available DLC for the most part ties in with the story directly, telling the events of certain situations happening as they happened through the perspective of other characters. This helps with the telling of the story, and naturally gives you insight to other key characters. Most DLC packages released fail in this respect to add value to a story or game, but simply layer information which was originally not planned into a title. The DLC in this case is worth playing once you've completed the game.\n\nSure, post-apololyptic games are considered a cliche. 4A really have done an incredible job with refining this game into the vision set by its creator who helped the vision come to light. You need to play this game, Redux or otehrwise, so stop reading and get engrossed in the Metro.","March 2, 2015","true","54.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For the first time, they're using colours and the graphics are now appealing, instead of just high definition. The story is still bland and generic, but they did manage to make me hate a character, so that's improved too.\n\nLike the previous episode, this game suffers greatly from two things. The first problem is that it is linear in the worst way possible. 90% of the game consists of you clearing a room and then searching for which corner of the room isn't a decoration, but actually a way to the next room. The second problem is the lack of any satisfying gunfights. Your encounters with mutants are boring at best and annoying at worst. Fighting humans isn't terrible, but it still isn't as fun as most other shooters.\n\nYour choice to play or not to play this game comes down to one thing. Do you think good graphics make a good game? If so, you'll enjoy Last Light. If not, then you'll be very disappointed by all the wasted potential.","January 14","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is very rich and has a core message (which I won't spoil) that is, in my opinion, beautiful.\n\nI recommend playing both Metro games because they're wonderful experiences. The attention to detail is amazing and you feel as if the Metro was a living and breathing environment, rich with many people to meet and places to go. If you love amazing stories, get this.","November 12, 2015","true","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For the first time, they're using colours and the graphics are now appealing, instead of just high definition. The story is still bland and generic, but they did manage to make me hate a character, so that's improved too.\n\nLike the previous episode, this game suffers greatly from two things. The first problem is that it is linear in the worst way possible. 90% of the game consists of you clearing a room and then searching for which corner of the room isn't a decoration, but actually a way to the next room. The second problem is the lack of any satisfying gunfights. Your encounters with mutants are boring at best and annoying at worst. Fighting humans isn't terrible, but it still isn't as fun as most other shooters.\n\nYour choice to play or not to play this game comes down to one thing. Do you think good graphics make a good game? If so, you'll enjoy Last Light. If not, then you'll be very disappointed by all the wasted potential.","January 14","true","11.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So all of this was rather new to me save the gameplay improvements from Metro 2033 that were put into these Redux versions.\n\nLast Light assumes you got the "bad" ending for 2033, which you probably did because getting the good ending for that requires playing this FPS more as a sneaky stealth game where you should avoid killing people. Similarly, to get the good ending for Last Light, you have to go against your instinct to brutally murder all of the horrible people found in this game. And trust me... there are alot of horrible people to be found here who deserve to die. I know full well that hardcore communists are evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but to make them actually worse than Nazis of the same setting? That's a pretty severe level of depravity.\n\nHonestly, this irritated me because I was playing for the good ending, and ended up not playing the way I wanted to. ♥♥♥♥ moral choice systems in games. If it wasn't for the great atmosphere, good story, and above average gameplay, I would throw this game in a bin for that. But instead I have to give this a "yes" simply because one ♥♥♥♥-up (and it was a big one) did not ruin the entire game for me.\n\n*sigh*\n\nSo... sure. It's alright. It's fine.

Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.\n\nFinishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there’s no need.\n\nGetting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.\n\nFlipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.\n\nSo enjoy\n","March 14","true","26.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

Ομολογουμένως δεν έχει να προσφέρει τίποτα το ιδιαίτερο, που να δικαιολογεί τα € 20 της αγοράς του. Το Survival mode εξισορροπεί τη δράση του και το φέρνει πιο κοντά στον προκάτοχό του, αλλά είναι ένα χαρακτηριστικό που από μόνο του δεν αρκεί. Η όλη προσπάθεια φτάνει να φαντάζει περισσότερο σαν απόδειξη προόδου της 4A engine, παρά σαν remake, καθότι επί της ουσίας δεν πρόκειται για τέτοιο.\nΤα παραπάνω φυσικά αφορούν τον ήδη κάτοχο του Last Light, διότι ο παίκτης που δεν είχε έρθει μέχρι τώρα σ’ επαφή με τη δημιουργία των Ουκρανών, πλέον έχει έναν παραπάνω, έστω και μικρό, λόγο να το κάνει.\n\nIf someone owns Metro: Last Light, there's absolutely no reason to buy the Redux version. Graphically its the very same game, while the DLC content and the Survival/Spartan mode are not enough to justify this new release and the € 20 price, even with the differentiation the later offers to the gameplay. On the other hand, whoever hasn't played the original game yet, has another good reason to do it now.\n\nhttp://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/metro-last-light-redux-pc-review","September 14, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This game will immerse you in the Metro, and make you believe you are a part of their world, even though you're just some fat kid playing video gaemes. The tunnels are dark, and eerie and there's ambient noise everywhere, walking around kicked cans, lamps, and even people. Spooby. Playing this game on Ranger mode is a must if you want to be engrossed in the world, no HUD, no tool tips, just you, a lighter, and your favourite silent ♥♥♥♥ gun. The tunnels are claustrophobic, the make you feel constricted you hear a noise at the other end you have no choice but you go find it and throw a knife at it. and those ♥♥♥♥ing bugs that you have to scare away with your light, pure nightmares. The surface is equally a scary, even scarier at some points, from little fish that spit green snot at you, to huge flying beasts that are sooooo hard to kill, and are even harder to get away from if you're out in the open. The surface is a marvel to look at, and had me stop and looking around for stuff. Running out of filters is a ♥♥♥♥ING nightmare on Ranger, run out of those and you are dead unless you can find some lying around.\n\n\nCons: Agh, this game is not easy, this is not a con for some people, but sometimes I just like going balls deep and firing all my weapons into the faces of my enemies, but this game is like ♥♥♥♥ that. Walk around with a silenced EVERYTHING and spam throwing knifes, which at some times can be frustrating and difficult but not impossible. At some times the enemy AI can be completely brain dead at, other times they can hear you squeeze one out 20ft away from them. I did experiecne that bug that stopped me from finishing the game without wiping my save completely, so I have yet to finish Metro: Last Light, this is a HUGE problem and completely broke the immersion for me, and forced me to stop playing, on the other hand the time I did play was fantastic and a absolute treat. But this needs to be fixed ASAP, very big problem, and it seems to be quite popular simple search on the Internets proved that for me.\n\nConclusion: If you are like me and love being immersed inside a game than this is a MUST have you need to play this game. This game is easily one of my favourite single player experiences and is a big step in the right direction for 4A games, Metro 2033 was good, but this something that needs to be played for the majority of gamers. Unless you like running around and shooting stuff and not thinking about anything (but who doesn't every now and again). This is a 9/10 for me, the few things held it back but nothing too major apart from the game killing bug.","June 17, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game will immerse you in the Metro, and make you believe you are a part of their world, even though you're just some fat kid playing video gaemes. The tunnels are dark, and eerie and there's ambient noise everywhere, walking around kicked cans, lamps, and even people. Spooby. Playing this game on Ranger mode is a must if you want to be engrossed in the world, no HUD, no tool tips, just you, a lighter, and your favourite silent ♥♥♥♥ gun. The tunnels are claustrophobic, the make you feel constricted you hear a noise at the other end you have no choice but you go find it and throw a knife at it. and those ♥♥♥♥ing bugs that you have to scare away with your light, pure nightmares. The surface is equally a scary, even scarier at some points, from little fish that spit green snot at you, to huge flying beasts that are sooooo hard to kill, and are even harder to get away from if you're out in the open. The surface is a marvel to look at, and had me stop and looking around for stuff. Running out of filters is a ♥♥♥♥ING nightmare on Ranger, run out of those and you are dead unless you can find some lying around.\n\n\nCons: Agh, this game is not easy, this is not a con for some people, but sometimes I just like going balls deep and firing all my weapons into the faces of my enemies, but this game is like ♥♥♥♥ that. Walk around with a silenced EVERYTHING and spam throwing knifes, which at some times can be frustrating and difficult but not impossible. At some times the enemy AI can be completely brain dead at, other times they can hear you squeeze one out 20ft away from them. I did experiecne that bug that stopped me from finishing the game without wiping my save completely, so I have yet to finish Metro: Last Light, this is a HUGE problem and completely broke the immersion for me, and forced me to stop playing, on the other hand the time I did play was fantastic and a absolute treat. But this needs to be fixed ASAP, very big problem, and it seems to be quite popular simple search on the Internets proved that for me.\n\nConclusion: If you are like me and love being immersed inside a game than this is a MUST have you need to play this game. This game is easily one of my favourite single player experiences and is a big step in the right direction for 4A games, Metro 2033 was good, but this something that needs to be played for the majority of gamers. Unless you like running around and shooting stuff and not thinking about anything (but who doesn't every now and again). This is a 9/10 for me, the few things held it back but nothing too major apart from the game killing bug.","June 17, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Artyom was tasked by Miller to eliminate this target however Khan told him to speak and communicate with it to see what it wants.

Like really really Dark, what i mean by that is that you will find decaying corpses everywhere around the game, lost spirits of children from the war still crying and waiting for their parents in haunted tunnels, flash-backs on the previous world, ruthless bandits terrorizing women and children and other saddening things.\n\nThe Gunplay in this game is very satisfying, shooting feels good, reloading feels good, customizing your weapon is always nice. And i've heard from a friend that in the previous game (Metro 2033) the gunplay was awful so this is a big-step up. There are plentiful amounts of weapons in the game, the Lolfie being my favourite handgun which you can transform into an smg thanks to the customazation in the game.\n\nIn this game you will find yourself in various locations, my favourite being the Surface a place full of radiation, mutant gigantic creatures and basically what remains of the city of Moscow, this is where you see all the flash-backs, and resources are scarce so every bullet counts (If you're playing on Ranger Mode) you will always need to wear a gasmask in the surface other wise you suffocate to death and for those gas masks you need filters or else you suffocate to death.\nYou will also find yourself in a Nazi Prison where you can break out from, and the most important places where you can buy bullets, new weapons and gadgets are the underground town sort of things. Every place feels alive! Even if you are alone.. (You'll found out what I mean when you play the game)\n\nThe Visuals are breathtaking, and about the gas masks that i talked about earlier; they can get all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ on them that you can wipe off; Dirt, Moss, Blood, Water.\nAnd for a fully immersive experience i 100% Recommend playing the game in Ranger Mode, it's the true way to experience the game in your first playthrough and also this game is very replayable.\n\nWhile this is about Artyom's (The Main Character you play as) journey through the Metro it is also him growing as a person, this happens with Moral Points, Moral Points can be heard by over-hearing enemies or other people talk about intresting things, i once came across a man putting on an educational show for teaching children about the previous animals before the war happend he did this by using a light projecter and making animals using his hand shadows (I think thats what its called) after listening through what the children think they are and what they feel about it you earn a Moral Point, I think my favourite one was where a child was crying when he lost his teddy bear and i went and retrieved it for him and he gave me a nice Thank you, his mother thanked me aswell, little things like this makes your heart tingle.\n\nIn the plot they are a few twists that will lead you with an open mouth that i will not spoil.\n\nAnd that's all I can think of saying about this true work of art, the ending that i got made me satisfied, i got a litttle bit sad that it was the end but i just hope that they will make another Metro game.\n\nI Reccomend this game with full confidence that you will enjoy it.\n\n\n\n","March 23","true","29.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As A metro fan I have played through both games and enhanced versions multiple times and I can definitely call myself a Metro Fan.  I family shared Metro: Last Light Redux for the purpose of this review, I like Last Light Redux enough to definitely give it a positive review.\n\nLast Light Redux does not change much about Last Light overall. it mostly consists of enhanced graphics and fixes. I can at least say that I feel the graphics definitely look better, and maxed out they are pretty amazing. Something I want to note however is that I have experienced a good deal of new bugs in the Redux version, a few of them serious like corrupted auto saves and some random performance issues in certain areas of the game. Even with these I would still recommend the game, as they seem rare enough to not be a deal breaker.\n\nAnother important addition to Last Light Redux is that it includes all previously released DLC and new modes to play through the game, for someone looking for the complete Last Light experience I would obviously recommend Redux over getting the original release of Last Light and all the DLC.\n\nReally though, in the end I would say that if you are a Metro fan, and you have not played Redux yet get it and play through it, If you like it chances are you will play through Last Light Redux multiple times. I was able to play through Last Light Redux about three and a half times before I started to get bored.\n\nI recommend Metro: Last Light Redux to fans of shooters, post apocalyptic games, and fans of the Metro series. With its multiple varied story choices and multiple endings, Metro: Last Light Redux is sure to make a decent addition to anyone's game library.","October 25, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game is more or less a more streamlined version of Metro 2033. Balancing is better, gameplay is even more linear and the controls feel slightly less awkward. Apart from that, it's kind of boring - they cut back on the mysteries and workings of the post-war world and instead make you fight human soldiers a whole lot. If it weren't for the outfits and occasional monster - you could mistake this for any old run of the mill military shooter at times. The structue of this title is pretty basic too - shoot people, story time, shoot some more people. Occasionally flip a lever. That's about it - not exactly the most exciting videogame under the sun. Many, many scripted scenes aren't really helping Metro either. Survival aspects are still as annoying as in Metro 2033, and everything still handles rather "inconvenient" too.\n\nApart from the aforementioned visuals, I found this to be a really dull experience and for some reason a lot less atmospheric than the prequel. The base conflict of the story (certain human factions fighting for supremacy in the tunnels) left little room for the true "star" of this series, the postapocalyptic world and its inhabitants, to shine. Just like Metro 2033, the game suffers from too many frustrating design decisions and somewhat poorly realized ideas that I am not enjoying. Truly stunning graphics for 3.75 bucks, but left no lasting impression on me and thus no recommendation.","May 28","false","7.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Thumbs up for this version if they actually clean it up.\n\nI had to replay one of the longer chapters because of a well known bug with the boss. All the nosalises started freezing in place, that was no fun, then I got to the boss and it was frozen too and wouldn't die. Had to restart the chapter. But when I did that, I got loaded into something that I hadn't even seen yet in the story, so I HAD TO RESTART THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER all because of this -known- bug.

I was hoping the difficulty would return to that of the original 2033 (which was pretty damn hard). I thought Survival mode would bring the game back to it's roots, where scavenging for filters, ammo, and medkits was a constant concern because you were always low. But no, survival mode is nothing more than "Ranger mode" from Last Light, where as Spartan Mode is more of a handicap than anything.\n\nReally disappointed in the way the Metro series went. Since the original FEAR, I had been looking for another survival horror game with an emphasis on action without making it too arcadey. I thought I found that after the original 2033, but the Redux's showed me otherwise.\n\n","December 12, 2014","false","3.9"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","28","57","0","0"

Metro Last Light probably has the single worst morality system I have ever seen in +1k hours of gaming. What is the point of designing and implementing so many various post-apocalyptic style guns and improvised weapons if the game penalizes you for using them? Now granted, you can throw caution to the wind and kill every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you come across with your bloodlust and accept the "Bad/Evil ending" as your penance for the brutal, anarchaic, warmongering, murdering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you are...\n\nBut that ending is ♥♥♥♥.\n\nA breath taking and death defying adventure with danger at every corner coupled with the anxiety over your dwindling supplies as you trudge through the darkest of Moscow's subway system brutally cut off at the end. And there is absolutely no forgiveness. It's completely all or nothing. Yes, you can spend 11 hours tediously sneaking up behind every guard, spare everyone's life, give every bit of your money to the poor, kiss babies, and volunteer at the soup kitchen every wednesday of the month, But then you get that one lapdance. Suddenly, you're the antichrist himself.\n\nOkay, I exaggerate. Still there's no indication how far to one side you're leaning. You maybe be shooting for the good ending, and suddenly get surprised with the bad ending. The decision ultimately feels arbitrary, and it comes off like the game only wants you to play it a certain way. No, I don't want that in my games. The morality system soured the whole experience. An ending is supposed to leave you wanting more, but this has left me wanting to go play something else.\n\nI give it a 5/10. However, if I played through the game and Alt F4'd out of the final scene to go watch the ending I want on youtube, I would give it an 8/10. Or better yet do away with the morality system altogether and I would give it an 8/10. This game could have been massively improved with one awesome ending as the grand finale.\n\nThe game was gorgeous and a lot of love was put into the story, but it's merits were over shaddowed by the morality system.\n\n\nTL;DR watch the ending on youtube.","August 3, 2015","false","11.2"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","10","21","3","0"

The lights, the fogs and the sound effects are seem like as if those be real.\nThe story still great and exciting.\nAnd the achievements almost all obtainable, except the;\n\nTest Complete\nComplete the TOWER level.\nThis achievement is a nightmare! I did not expect this hard difficulty of the 'Metro' series.\n\nSo, any new what I can say now the end of the 'Metro Last Light'.\nWithout any spoiler I can say that I was a little bit sad at the and of the story. I did first the good end but I was not happy when I had seen that end. But not drama either. It was only touching me.\n\nExcept the bad and. That made me a little bit cry. Anyway I did no like make the bad and, that achievement needs that you behave as if you are a really bad person. Do not help anyone, do not listen anyone, do that what the others do not want, let everybody down, etc.\nSo, I did not like play in this way but I wanted get that achievement.\n\nGood thinks:\nGreat atmosphere, lights, fogs and sound effects.\nThe much of action cut-scenes are monumental of actions.\nThe actors did great job.\nI still like these sort of home made weapon design.\nThe DLC missions are interesting. Except the 'Test Complete' that is not!\nBad things:\nI had crashed two times in 43 hours playtime.\nThe 'Test Complete' is annoying hard.\nI recommend this game to those who interest the sci-fi and mystic stories and bear or like the FPS games.\n\nTo those who interest get all achievements, my suggestion to think more about the ''Test Complete' achievement. That can make you angry.","October 6, 2015","true","43.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

There were some more shootout portions than in the first game, but I was surprised to see plenty of stealth parts as well (I played Spartan mode). I enjoyed the story a lot more because it wasn't just trying to find certain locations all the time like in the original, it was trying to stop a war and running into a lot of cool characters along the way. That is also a big improvement, there was alot more focus on characters and characterization in this game that I enjoyed (I loved Pavel). The story also added more faction warfare that we did not see as much of in the first game. The Chronicles DLC was also a lot of fun but the other DLC were meh, you get them with this purchase anyway so you may as well try them out. All in all, I enjoyed this game much more than the first, and I think it is an extremely solid post-apocalyptic FPS.","February 20, 2015","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Last Light is a good sequel to its predecessor. While not in novel form, this game was written by the author of the books themselves. Like a book, the game follows a set linear path in which you cannot change besides the ending. Last Light expands upon the gunplay of 2033 by adding various optics and other weapon modifications, plus a few new firearms to liven it up.\n\nMy only issue with Last Light is I feel there are too many instances where control is taken away from the player for cinematic purposes. I also dislike the stinger sounds that play whenever something is about to happen or does. The atmosphere of 2033 was hardened by the fact that there was no actual stinger sounds to accompany events, nor did it take control from the player much. Immersing myself was a somewhat daunting task at times.\n\nBesides all those nitpicks, it is a very good game. I certainly enjoyed it.","August 18, 2015","true","42.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Last Light is a good sequel to its predecessor. While not in novel form, this game was written by the author of the books themselves. Like a book, the game follows a set linear path in which you cannot change besides the ending. Last Light expands upon the gunplay of 2033 by adding various optics and other weapon modifications, plus a few new firearms to liven it up.\n\nMy only issue with Last Light is I feel there are too many instances where control is taken away from the player for cinematic purposes. I also dislike the stinger sounds that play whenever something is about to happen or does. The atmosphere of 2033 was hardened by the fact that there was no actual stinger sounds to accompany events, nor did it take control from the player much. Immersing myself was a somewhat daunting task at times.\n\nBesides all those nitpicks, it is a very good game. I certainly enjoyed it.","August 18, 2015","true","42.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I give it a 10 beacause well I love Metro games. If you dont own LL then get it, if you do theres little reason to get Redux version its basicly the same thing other then what I mentioned earlier in my review. Thanks for reading my review.

But overall it is a wonerful game to get when it is on sale, Its the type of game you would only play the campaign through 3 times, for me $20 isn't woth a game you beat 3 times, but if you ever see it on-sale then I would recommend getting it.","October 24, 2015","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Last Light takes off where 2033 ended, throwing you, Artyom head first into the action. You are enlisted under The Order (Polis Rangers), an elite army of rangers dedicated to keeping peace within the metro. However, after learning of the Spartans discoverey of D6, the reds want a piece of the cake and they will get it by any means necessary.\n\n\nYou've been visited by an old friend, Khan, informing you of one last surviving 'Dark One', an infamous race of deformed creatures that nearly wiped out Artyom's home station Exhibition, but were unsuccessful when Artyom fired hell missiles upon the Dark One's home. The Orders commander, Miller, orders elite sniper Anna and yourself to hunt the once thriving community of Botanical Gardens, now the ruins of the Dark One's home, to destroy the last surviving Dark One.\n\nThrough your travels deep within the Metro and on the surface you meet friends, bandits, opposing forces and new mutants. You are given a wider array of weapons, all of which have the ability to be modded, adding laser sights, silencers, extended magazines among additional useful tools. You have the choice to act alone using stealth, sticking to the shadows picking off targets one by one, careful not to be seen, or as a one man powerhouse, shooting your way through the Metro, crushing all who stand in your way to Polis station.\n\nLast Light keeps what we loved about 2033, the atmosphere. As you make your way through the dead, barren wastes of post apocalyptic Moscow you're unsure of what hides behind the next corner, what danger lies within what's left of the dead cities structures. You are standing among the fallen, shadowy outlines of what used to be, cries of children ringing in your ears. Gunshots in the distance, crackles and rustling behind you. Safety and warmth only provided by the friendly stations deep underground within the Metro.\n\nYour fate is ultimately decided the way you progress the game. Do you show mercy to those who oppose you, do you destroy anything or anyone that threatens you. Do you help the homeless and assist civilians against bandits. It's all down to you.\n\n\nMetro Last Light is certainly worth a look if you like first person shooters, apocalyptic, adventure and creepy games. It provides a strong story line directly connected to 2033, a wonderful atmosphere to experience, smooth controls, stunning visual graphics and sounds.\n","February 10","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But overall it is a wonerful game to get when it is on sale, Its the type of game you would only play the campaign through 3 times, for me $20 isn't woth a game you beat 3 times, but if you ever see it on-sale then I would recommend getting it.","October 24, 2015","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I didnt look up anything of the game to try and get a blind test but i new it was a survival game with story driven aspects, after playing games like fallout and stalker I had  high hopes. well i was very very wrong. The first problem i had was running the game, I have a GTX 970, i5 process with 16gb  of ram so expecting at least 60fp at max settings expecially with this being an older title. No i got 40fps and thats not even on max settings. Would be forgiven if the game looked nice with graphical pleasing  scenery what it doesn't, there are some nice cinimatic shots of the waste land but not enough to make me expect that frame rate. The A.I. is brain dead with them either avoiding you for no reason or hitting you once to then run off to hit your A.I. buddy who then misses so then then runs off, Makes the game play look real cool with all the missing adn running around, looks like old people tring to break dance. The shooting is not satsifing and seems more like a grind then for any kind of fun. But when your not shooting you will be walking talking about something that you have no idea about or care for. Non of the characters are at all interesting and are the generic russian stereotypes. They kill off characters and im left think who  was that or just like there goes another one. I will say the guns are very interesting with some cool ideas and lots of customization like fire bullets and a tone of attachments. The use of bullets as both ammo and a curency is an unqiue idea that matches with the theme well, can lead to important decision like should I save up for a gun or uses them in the next mission. However with little variety of missions means that they can get boring fast and with most of the game being you geuesed I a metro can leave the enviroments looking bland and unoriginal.\nOverall I find this game frustrating and boring with little to satisfy my gaming needs. With no story and simple game play that leaves a lot to be desired I would not recommend this game.\n","May 19","false","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The AI is pretty stupid though, and even one step you take without crouching makes them question the sound even though they have a dozen friends running around already. Another thing that really annoys me is changing between your throwable weapons, you have to move your mouse while in-game in a very idiotic way that I really cannot even describe.\n\nThe Redux version of Last Light does not differ from the original at all, if you don't count some fixed lighting.

An Interesting Sequel But With More Than One Boob To Be Found.Genre: First Person Linear Shooter with Horror and Stealth Mechanics.\nDeveloped and Published by: 4A Games and Deep Silver.\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and Consoles.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nRedux Edition purchased by myselfRead the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]\n\nIf you’re wondering why I’m reviewing this game with a scant couple of hours on Steam's record, most of the playtime went into the original Metro: Last Light edition with over 12 hours worth of playtime sunk into it. As I feel the differences between the original and Redux are pretty negligible, I’m confident that my opinion fits for both editions. This was going to be a double review for both editions but the original edition of Last Light was pulled from Steam recently so I decided to combine it into one review.\n\nThe Bugs and Stability Situation\nThe game comes off as an overpriced Game-of-the-Year edition with a patch to fix some, but not all, of the problems the original game had. Really, it’s kind of insulting how many bugs and glitches survived to this re-release of Last Light. For myself, I ran into a game-crashing bug during the walk with Khan in the level “Quarantine”. I was heading over to the gun merchant when the game suddenly freezes and crashes. There wasn't any indication of what caused it. The only way to get around it was to load the chapter itself, not the auto-save. There was also animation, texture oddities and mutant attack issues that you could notice from time to time. I would also notice characters speaking over each other. There are also numerous reports on the Steam forums of bugs and crashes so this is definitely a touchy game.\n\nPC Settings and Optimization\nOptimization wise, the game is about the same as Metro 2033 Redux. Which isn't all that surprising considering they’re on the same engine. Its pretty good for me, but there are plenty of reports to the contrary. There is yet another graphics quality slider but thankfully we can change a few more settings such as V-sync, Tessellation, SSAA and Texture Filtering now. Field-of-view has to be changed in a user.cfg file. You can look up the instructions here on PCGamingWiki.[pcgamingwiki.com] It’s a few steps forward but more fine-tuned control would have been appreciated.\n\nThe Stealth System\nThe stealth system. It basically boils down to: stay in the shadows, don’t run and use silenced weapons/takedowns. Unless you really screw up or get impatient, the AI will never pick up that you were/are there. Even if you are standing five inches away from their face. The stealth system is two-dimensional and about as deep as a puddle. It is slightly better balanced than the Redux edition of Metro 2033 but I think that’s because the entire game was made with this stealth system in mind rather than tacked on later.\n\nCombat Systems\nCombat system isn’t quite as bad as Metro 2033 Redux’s but it isn’t that much better. A lot of enemies are bullet sponges and there are a lot of them. I don’t like the Ranger-setting restricting you to two weapons only but that’s a personal preference. Considering there are a lot of interesting weapons in the game, you really don’t get a lot of chance to hold and keep them as you’ll need silenced weapons on some levels and then fully-automatic weapons at other levels. Secondary weapons like knives are still handled poorly with the “press shift then move your mouse in the direction of the weapon you want” design. Far too many times, I would select what I thought were anti-personnel mines only to press the secondary weapon button and throw a knife. Cute. Keys 6-9 still exist Metro devs and they work wonders over your current implementation. Hitboxes still feel wonky but it’s hard to place why.\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nThe journey itself through the Metro is still very immersive. The game is focused on presenting and enveloping you in the atmosphere of the Russian Metro in a post-apocalyptic future. Which, they pull of to a fantastic degree. I really have to give them kudos on this part because this was what kept me going through the game. Everything from wiping the swamp water or blood off your gas mask to the howling winds on the surface to the slowed progress you make through thick spiderwebs (that can be burned with your lighter). There’s a lot of world detail in this game and this part simply oozes polish. Even the recharging of certain weapons and your power for the flashlight and/or night vision, which would normally seem pointless otherwise, fits so well in this type of game. Credit given where it’s due, this game executes the world’s atmosphere excellently.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBut, I can’t recommend Metro: Last Light Redux for new or returning players. Additionally, if you already have the original edition of Last Light, play it instead. Otherwise, you’re basically paying for an overpriced patch. To be frank, I feel cheated for having bought the Redux editions when compared to the original editions that I own. After all, it seems like they didn’t even take the time to make sure all of the bugs and glitches of the original were fixed. Worse still, is that the Mac and Linux versions haven’t been released yet. Granted, we’re still within the stated release date of “later this year” but we’re getting into November now. Time is running out. *Final Update* Both Linux and Mac versions were released earlier this year. Far behind schedule I think. I haven't heard anything about either versions.\n\nRead the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\nA Paladin's Steam Review: Metro 2033 Original Edition\nA Paladin's Steam Review: Metro 2033 Redux Edition","November 10, 2014","false","1.7"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","25","52","0","1"

If you played Last Light there's nothing new in the Redux.  If you a fan of the original Metro 2033, not the Last Light wannabe that Metro 2033 Redux was, you won't enjoy this one.  Everything that was great in the original is lost here.  This game is just a mindless shooter like the resident Evil and Call of Duty games.  As matter of fact this game actually has Boss battles like Resident Evil.  What do creature Boss battles have to do with Metro games?\n\nThis is a heavily scripted game with a convoluted story that only serves to get you to the next round of shooting.  The AI is amazingly dumb and can't see you even if they are in front of you.  It seemed to me that the mutants were harder to kill only because the weapons damage was inconsistent.  In Metro 2033 you could rely on your weapons because the damage they doled out was consistent.  In Last Light Redux it seems to be arbitrary.  Even the sniper rifles were inconsistent in their damage; usually one shot to the head with a sniper rifle is an instant kill in in most games but not in this one.  Even the pneumatic weapons like the Tihar that were so deadly in Metro 2033, so much so that you could kill the Librarians easily with them, are hit and miss in this game.  Sometimes one shot to the head will do it and sometime you have to just keep blasting away.\n\nI never found Metro 2033 to be too linear of a game even though you were in tunnels going from tunnel to another.  The same can't be said for Metro Last Light Redux it feels very linear.  You simply shoot your way from point A to point B.  Like the Boss battles in Resident Evil you just need to figure out what the key is.  In one laughable Boss battle the oversized mutant needed to knock down columns in order to bring down the ceiling so it was just a matter of running around in circles and letting the mutant knock them down, thereby saving my ammo.\n\nThere were too many of these scripted click a button and fend off the mutants until whatever is supposed to happen finally happens.  In those scenarios I found that I could save ammo by just running around in circles, like a fool, shooting the odd Nosalis that got in my way while waiting for the event to finish, i.e. the boat arrives for you to jump on to make your escape.  It’s basically one obviously scripted scene after another.\n\nAlso way too many cut scenes, a significant amount of the game is made up of cut scenes that you can't skip.  Most of this is story exposition, because the story was convoluted and very artificial.  Metro 2033, being based on the novel, had a very simple, straightforward plot and it was good at story telling.  However, even though the same author wrote the story line for Last Light, it really had the feeling of being a slapped together plot to justify the Metro Last Light sequel.\n\nBottom line if your Metro 2033 fans you will be disappointed in Last Light.  But if you’re a Resident Evil / Call of Duty fan there are plenty of mutants (just not the weird Resident Evil kind) and soldiers to shoot at.  So if you're just looking for a linear FPS shooter with fantastic graphics, and don't really care about the plot then you won't be disappointed in this game.\n","June 10, 2015","false","18.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Yes! Does it have solid gunplay? Yes. But that is bascially it. I really liked the first game but this is just more of the same and some additional bad stuff.\n\nNote: I only played this game on the hardest difficulty level on Ranger mode. That means less supply, no HUD, so basically more immersive. BUT: While the game teaches you the basic controls (which should not be new to you, if you ever played an FPS) it doesn't explain controls that are specific for this game. If I hadn't played the first game I would had no idea that you can keep the flashlight button pressed to get out the dynamo to charge your batteries. And I skipped a lot of weapons until I found out that I had to keep the use button pressed to pick up a weapon. And later in a car I had to press every button to find the one that starts the engine. One may argue that it improves the immersion of the ranger mode but if have to open the control options several times to find all the buttons, this is stupid. And there are also hand symbols on your screen when you can open a door so that breaks the immersion as well, if you argue like that.\n\nAlso: For a game (world) where resources are apparently rare, you find way too much of them. So many times I couldn't pick up ammunition (even for my main guns), gas filters or medicine and this just feels stupid if you see yourself as a scavenger in a postapocalyptic world. And later in the game resources are suddenly very rare and it's then even more stupid that you can carry a lot of ammunition that you will never use (because you have a seperate ammunition slot and limit for each type of ammunition but you can only carry 2 guns at the same time) but not a single additional gas filter later on. Some sort of inventory management would have been better here I feel. I also got stuck later in the game without gas filters (sorry for looking around too much...) and no medicine (because it all of a sudden became very rare) and I really lost the will to keep playing the game. It's not that the game was too hard. I could have avoided that situation. But together with the bad boss design (more below) and the not that interesting story, I felt no urge to restart the chapter and try to make it better.\n\nFor a game that is called Metro, you also play too much outside later in the game. While interesting at first, it just get tedious with the need to frequently change your gas filters every 3 minutes or so (what kind of filters are that?). The outdoor sections are just annoying and you often don't know where to go because it's not apparent where you can go or jump over or where you'll find invisible walls. You have a clipboard with sort of a compass that shows you the right direction and you'll need that very, very often. But you can't really see the compass if you use your night vision goggles that you also often want to use in the dark sections of the game... The good parts of the game are the close quarter or underground sections but these also feel exactly like playing Metro 2033.\n\nThere is also a Karma system that determines the ending of the game (like in the first game) but for me, the system makes no sense. Why does listening to a boring story increases your Karma (or whatever)? And there was a situation where I had to decide to let someone die or rescue him, but I had no idea how to rescue him (again no button prompts or so in Ranger mode), so he died although I wanted to help him... So be prepared to watch the "good" ending on YouTube after finishing the game.\n\nAnother large problem I have with this game is the boss design. These are just large creatures that take a lot of bullets to kill. But this game is not made for this. It has good, realistic gun play but no real dodge or cover mechanic so you just run around the enemy in circles and shoot at him until it's dead... Wow... I mean that is some way to deplete your resources and find a reason to pick up new ones.\n\nThe fight against human enemies or the normal creatures on the other hand is fun. In Ranger mode, enemies die from a headshot but you die very fast as well. I found that very rewarding. But this comes with another problem: The sneaking. You can avoid a lot of the fights by just staying in the dark, killing enemies silently or sneak around them. But the reaction of the enemies to your sneaking is very, very basic. They either don't see you at all, see you for a short time, but think it was probably nothing after shortly searching for you or instantly see you if you are not in the dark. They also seem to ignore their friends that die next to them from a throwing knife (that for some reason instantly kills an unaware enemy but not an aware enemy). You are basically invisible or visible for everyone. These are not solid stealth mechanics for me. I prefer the shooting anyway but on the hardest difficulty you normally have to sneak or at least kill some enemies before you get detected.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis game has a lot of potential but doesn't use it correctly. Play Metro 2033, especially the Redux version, and you'll get a much better game that focuses much more on the underground section with occasional surface sections that feel much more terrifying. Last Light, in my oppinion, adds nothing that improves its predecessor.\n\nI also had problems with crashes every 5 minutes in the middle of the game and I did not found a solution for that. I was somehow able to finish this section (maybe a graphics card driver update solved the problem) and continue but together with the fact, that the intro logos of the game take like 2 minutes and ARE FOR SOME STUPID REASON NOT SKIPPABLE, it got very, very annoying.","March 1","false","9.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I was really hoping that in ranger mode you would be able to check you're inventory, like in 2033, but nope, not the case. 2033's redux made sense, but this is just a souless cashgrab that adds litterally nothing to the base game, and if anything, is worse.\n\n","May 11","false","0.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","5","12","3","0"

A bit to much handholding and following NPC around but aside from that the beginning is alot of fun, and great looking. Then about one third in maby the last half of the game its just garbage.\n\nGraphics are still decent, but alot of high contrast effects etc that just hurts my eyes and look terrible. Combat becomes just a run and gun where you run around trying to figure out what your suppose to do while monsters keep spawning. Bosses that are just bullet soakers where you waste all your ammo just to progress to the next area. You can not sneak past them like other parts of the game.\n\nThen you end up in frustrating parts where you ride trains and shoot at opposing trains, here you die if you dont kill the enemys fast enough, cover does not matter you just instantly die after about 3-4 sec. Other areas you are placed in a yard with tall buildings where enemys spawn and shoot down at you from all sides. All you get is some wood cover that they shoot thru, these areas and others you will have to just repeat untill you make it or find an exploit (was playing ranger mode).\n\nI played the game with russian speach and english subtitles, and dialoge was pretty good most of the time, but that to just got worse and at the end i didnt even bother with the dialog, it was painfull. Russian sounds cool tho, i recomend it. The english speach is even worse.\n\nTo summerise, combat is fun in the first part of the game, sound is not great and the dialoge story is nothing to praise really. It mostly comes down to the atmosphere and graphics in the first 3 hours of the game maby. Then everything is just a pain. I would not recomend this game for anything less then 9 euro, maby even less. Might be worth it to just play the first bit of the game again.","December 25, 2014","false","13.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It's not bad. not bad  at all, it's beautiful graphically and the gameplay is spot on to the original Metro game. but there is a few things that really made me decide against this game. but sadly, I cannot give it a thumbs up and here's why!\n\nFirst of all, the check point system is absolute garbage, rather than letting you save your own game, it autosaves and places checkpoints  at certain times, so if you ever die, you will end up back at that point. However, this checkpoint system backfires too often, because if it checkpoints only mere moments from your death, you'll just be stuck in a cycle that will require you to go back even further into your saves in order to undo that checkpoint and stop it from completely destroying your progress.\n\nThe story didn't feel as good as 2033. while I know the metro series was based off of the books, the first game was completely fine and I loved the story. in this game, I actually struggle to care for any of the characters, they are not interesting in the slightest, the story does have its moments, I'll give it that.\n\nThe most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ love interest ever in any game I've ever played. Seriously. I don't feel any build up between the player and Anna, yet they play her off as a lousy love interest , who you have ONE scene with her and it's a " we're ****ed, might as  well bang!" set up too. It was super weak and I don't see the point of the scene even existing. or Anna existing for that manner.\n\nI had high hopes for this game.

The story almost forgets about itself for most of the experience, essentially with you trying to get back on track for most of the game. It makes for interesting world building when you explore the genuinly creepy environments, but at the cost of the main-through-line narrative seeming like an afterthought. The last third ubruptly changes (thematically) to more overt 'morality'  based stuff and it just comes of as Po-faced.\n\nMetro 2033 is superior and with it's own redux version, the improvements to gameplay seen in Last Light are used to bolster up the narrativly superior 2033 <-- go buy that one instead.","August 10, 2015","false","9.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The story line is very linear and your choices don't really play out in the end. The game mechanics can be easily cheated (like using air filters), and you hardly take any damage, while pretty much every gun can headshot kill anything.  The AI aren't the smartest, and the bosses aren't even challenging (especially when the game's characters tell you their weakspots).  The game is overly sexual in content, and there isn't a need for it.  Most of the nudity is avoidable, some isn't.\n\nThere were many glitches where the  AI wouldn't  load correctly and were impossible to kill.  I had to restart from the last checkpoint, which sometimes was about 5 minutes of gameplay.  Not too bad, but annoying nonetheless. 21:9 resolution worked with no problems, and ran suprisingly well (proper scaled UI).\n\nPros:\nVisuals\n21:9 Support\nVoice Acting\nSoundtrack\nCons:\nLinear Story\nUnnecessarily Sexual\nPoor AI\nPoor Gun Balance\nCrashes/NPC Bugs\nOverall: 4/10","February 16","false","11.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

There's no FOV slider and the default FOV is so low it will make you sick. There's no quicksaving and if you start a different mission then the game will overwrite your previous saves.

Holo sights on weapons are useless because you can barely see anything through their green glass. Completely linear gameplay. No multiplayer. Ridiculously unrealistic setting.

Go from A to B to C\n3) The Dialogue/Monologue in between are unskippable\n4) No choice what so ever Do the task exactly like the Dev wants you or stay. That would not be a bad thing necessary but the info we get is just not enough we need to do a trial/error thing till we get it right.

Meaning if you can not compose a chalenging task have the Player do something dificult. Like looking for a needel in a pile of ♥♥♥♥ Game. I don't mind losing to a Boss or running out of time in a mission as long as it is fun and challenging, i will try and complete the mission 1k times.

At first I thought this was the best game I'd played since Half-life 2. Having played open world FPS's for the last few years, the linear scripted style was a nice and welcome change of pace, unfortunately it becomes exponentially stupidly difficult even on normal.\n\nSurvival mode. The purpose of this mode is to make ammo scarce among other things. I am accustom to beating games on hardcore so I started out in hardcore/survival AND hardcore ranger mode. The results.... I have never played a game with ammo so readily available. Its everywhere! around every corner, on every dude you kill. In every gun. Guns are everywhere too. I have never run out of ammo once. My thinking is that they somehow got survival mode and spartan mode mixed up because thats exactly the way it plays. Of course having lots of ammo didn't make it much easier because once your halfway thru the game it gets impossibly hard. Not challanging hard, stupid hard!\nYou will find yourself starting over just about every single scene a good 50 times minimum. I made it  75% but then had to make a excecutive decision to delete the game from my library as it was just not fun anymore. I am a hardcore FPS verteran but this was just pure BS!!!\n\nI came back a few months later and tried to finish the game, but this time on normal survival/normal ranger mode. Slightly easier but with noticably less health kits which made no sense. But again, every area beyond halfway thru the game required around 50 to 100 replays before finally fluking your way to the next check point. Made it to the "garden" where you have to get past the giant bear creature. Impossible with only one health kit, and when your close to making it, the wolfies randomly come after you and some are completely invonerable to death because they are part of the script that goes after the bear when you bring it down.\n\nThere is a fine line between challeging/rewarding and just obsurdly hard. Despite the graphics, design, atmosphere and story which are all perfect, the title is too unbalanced to recommend.\n\nHowever, if you like restarting over and over and over, then this is the game for you.","December 15, 2014","false","36.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

It is also a good fps, and graphisms are not so bad.\nI put a negative review, because there's still some bugs. Like, when you play in ranger hardcore difficulty, at some moment in the game, if you die by running out of air (not enough filter), you just respawn, and die by suffocating 10 secondes after. At many moments, I've got spawnkilled many times, so I had to restart the entire mission.\nIt was so a pain to play in this conditions that I decided to do the story in normal difficulty. So, I had enough filter, so, no problem with that, but I think that if I wouldn't have enough filter (wich is unusual in normal difficulty lol), It would has been the same (getting spawnkilled).\nIn conclusion, the game is pretty good, but this kind of bugs can screw everything.","November 20, 2015","false","16.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

My issue here is really with this "Redux" version.  I've played the game literally back-to-back with the original version, and, honestly, I don't see how it can be called an improvement -- especially in terms of the graphics.  Aside from the frame-rate being more stable and generally higher on equivalent settings, the graphics are either the same or a downgrade in certain areas.  The colors and lighting seem less dramatic and vibrant, water seems flat and lifeless compared to the water of the original, and the textures actually look more blurry and lower-resolution than some of the textures in the old game.  I don't know if this has to do with the games being designed to play better on consoles or what, but it's just very disappointing to see these shortcomings when I was looking forward to a graphical upgrade (one graphical improvement I really did appreciate, however, is the use of subtle reflections in wallpaint and other glossy surfaces).\n\nWhat makes it even worse is that the Redux version of 2033 was actually really great!  I played that one side by side with the old game and the improvements and changes were obvious and mostly for the better.  This game, on the other hand, is basically useless:  there is absolutely no reason to get this game if you have the original and the spartan-mode DLC.","May 24","false","14.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Почему они себя так ведут? На это есть какие-то причины? Нету. Они просто злые. Всё. Точка.\n\nЕщё в игре постоянно встречается "ТЯЖЕЛЫЙ МАРАЛЬНЫЙ ВЫБОР" между набиванием eбальников и перерезания горл.\n\nБоссфайты поражают своей оригинальностью - бегаем по кругу спиной вперед, отстреливая обойму за обоймой в огромную мясную тушу, изредка отвлекаясь на врагов поменьше. В чем суть? Почему бы просто не взорвать проход который всё равно позже протаранит головой тупой моб которому надоело гоняться за нями наматывая круги?\n\nВ смысле не то чтобы нам было необходимо по заданию убить ту или инную тушу мутировавшего мяса, мы просто встречаем на своем пути какого-то огромного мутанта которого нужно обязательно долго и нудно расстреливать. Зачем? Это абсолютно рушит всю суть игры, где тут сурвайвал вообще?\nПричем они не умирают даже, они просто убегают оставляя за собой проход. Это полная хeрня.\n\nПосле всего перечисленного можно задать легитимный вопрос - есть ли в этой игре вообще хоть что-нибудь хорошее?\nНу, тут довольно интересные модельки у оружия, особенно понравился тот дробовик на 6 патронов.\nЕщё здесь есть очень интересные пейзажи местностей, но не надейтесь что у вас будет время разглядеть их - только время чтобы нестись со всех ног по прямой кишке уровня.\n\nЯ постарался как можно более серьезно подойти к этому обзору и если вы читаете это, любите хорошие шутеры с разнообразным геймплеем и интересным сюжетом, в то время как на эту игру скидка - обойдите её стороной, она не стоит вашего внимания.","October 26, 2015","false","12.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Now we get into the meat and potatoes:  It's still a horrifyingly buggy pile of garbage, and quite frankly if you're really invested in Metro 2033's story (you would have disregarded the game given that it skews off the book within 5 mintues but I digress), just pretend this game never existed.\n\nAs for gameplay:\n-Badly suffers CoD disease, wherein there's so many scripted events and cutscenes you have 0 control over despite the game easily being able to let you control it.\n-Hilariously badly scripted moments.  I let the game run for half an hour while Pavel was hanging to see if it would give me mission failed.  Nope.

Why the hell would you hamfist in such pointless things? The fact that it feels like it's literally tacked on just for the sake of having in boobs is so childish it's not even funny.\n-Voices: If you're not playing with the russian voices, enjoy having so much cheesey accents breaking into plain american accents at times, and at worst, speaking bloody polish instead of russian.\n\nOverall 4/10 at least the shootbang is good when it works.

I cannot with a clear mind say that this game is worth it if you have the same setup as me, unless you want to not see the guys shooting you, don't want to see walls, don't even want to see most of the game. I don't know on this one if I'm the only one having the problem, but from what I can tell from some of the complaints for the redux of Metro 2033, its either a realitivly new problem or its just a really small case. Either way, I feel like I wasted 50 dollars, and I would like to say unless your fine with only seeing probably half the game? Go on and buy it, play it, so on and so forth, otherwise wait for a patch. Once more, it saddens me to not be able to play this game, but my sadness is easily replaced by anger when I could've gotten something else I know would've worked rather than thinking it would and finding out after I bought the game it doesnt.","September 2, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 19 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","3","19","0","5"

Metro itself is already severely underrated but the redux versions are amazing since it's a significant graphics and performance upgrade. As of now, this is my favorite single player game ever made so far. The atmosphere and story are unmatched. It made me more scared to be roaming the surface of the earth in broad daylight and I actually preferred being in unlighted metro tunnels. It manages to have as much action as a call of duty game yet can be scarier than games like Amnesia due to the heavy atmosphere. Between ghosts, anomalies, and underground warfare, The setting and story are actually so good I picked up the book this game is based on just to get more of it.\n\nnext time this game is on sale,\n♥♥♥♥ING BUY THIS ♥♥♥♥","January 3, 2015","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
