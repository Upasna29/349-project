It boils down to a short-but-sweet casual experience that will entertain, slightly challenge, and not frustrate.\n\nThe game is extremely light-hearted and is very casual.  The levels are pretty short and simple.  That being said, I really enjoyed the level design in this game: you have to pay attention but you don’t really have to think.  It’s a nice experience: it mildly challenges (mostly only if you’re going for the gold medals), has plenty of checkpoints, and there are no overly frustrating parts.  As someone who prefers casual games to frustrating ones; I can say I really enjoyed this.   If you are someone who enjoys punishment from their games, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nThere is no real story or anything, but it doesn’t need a story.  There are a few catoon-esque cutscenes.  The cartoonish art style and the music are a perfect match to the gameplay.  The platforming was smooth for me; I used a controller and was never frustrated with controls/response.  It is a short game, and is pretty easy to 100%.  As you progress, there are a handful of platforming mechanics that are mixed around to keep thinks interesting.\n\nTo surmise: Mutant Blobs Attack is a casual platformer with mild puzzle aspects and a cartoon finish.  A short-medium length game that is pretty easy, yet very entertaining.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","January 21, 2015","true","5.6"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","28","32","0","0"

Mutant Blobs Attack is a simple puzzle platformer where you eat stuff to get bigger so you can eat bigger stuff in order to progress through the short levels.

You are a blob who eats what is smaller than you.  As you eat you grow meaning that you eventually can eat just about everything you see.  The levels are well designed and the art style, music and sounds all work perfectly for a fun experience.  Expect a bit of a challenge if you plan to get all gold and unlock all achievements, but you won't pull your hair out.  The gameplay is simple, and slowly new additions to the gameplay are unveiled as you progress in the forgetful but entertaining storyline.  You will learn how to wall jump, how to use your telekinesis powers to move levers and slide platforms, and how to use magnets that attract and push you away.\n\nNothing hugely groundbreaking at all, but there's nothing wrong with taking a known to work recipe and splashing with a fresh coat of paint for you to enjoy.  Definitely recommend, especially if you are playing with kids.","August 31, 2015","true","14.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

You control a blob, I don't think he, she or it is given a name at any point, but for the purposes of this review I shall call him Steve... Steve DeBlob. Though as far as I know he isn't any relation to the blob from De Blob, that platforming, paint-'em-up classic, though I could be wrong. Instead, Steve DeBlob is a translucent, green blob with one eye who rolls through various 2D environments overcoming obstacles and gathering up ever bigger items to increase his size as he exacts his revenge against his human captors, and ultimately humanity as a whole. Sort of like a cross between Katamari Damacy, the underrated Puddle and that movie where the guy goes mental and kills everybody... you know the one I mean, right?\n\nBoth the platforming and puzzles are fairly easy affairs to begin with, maybe even a little tedious in their initial simplicity, but the difficulty level is judged almost perfectly as it ramps up at a steady and satisfying pace over the twenty-four levels. New elements of gameplay are gradually added to the mix, like the ability to move select platforms around with the cursor or being able to attract and repel Mr. DeBlob from certain structures, which nicely expands the range and complexity of puzzles that are thrown at you. But still, with little punishment for failure and a very forgiving checkpoint system, the majority of players won't be massively challenged for the most part, except maybe if you're a completionist intent on collecting everything, unlocking achievements or troubling the leaderboards, and depending on which of these players you are you'll likely make your way to the end in about four to six hours.\n\nBonus kudos has to go to the end game, though. Most of the time your reward for completing a game will be a fancy cutscene wrapping up the story, but here it's done a little differently. There are six chapters to tackle, with the first five incrementally increasing in difficulty, but by the sixth it shifts gears and becomes much easier while focusing everything on a different aspect rather than challenge... FUN. By the beginning of chapter six you've more or less beaten the game since you've made your way through the hardest parts and have essentially become a badass that can just stomp and roll your way through the stages with relatively little effort. So instead of having to endure one final, ultimate obstacle to prove your mastery of the game, your reward in place of a cutscene is to enjoy your power as you decimate everything in your path. It's a great way to end your time with any title and I really wish more games would follow this design, especially with the very last stage being a particularly great pay-off for all your work, and with the cherry on top being the sweet asking price, there's little excuse to not go and make friends with Steve DeBlob right now.","December 14, 2013","true","6.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

All I was told was 'it's a short 3-4 hour game, just sit back, play it and tell me what you think'. So here is what I think!\n\nIt IS a short 3-4 hour game, and I'm fine with that as it's the perfect length and really helps keep the game's charm alive. What this game is is a fun platform/puzzle game that has more internet references and meta-memes than ♥♥♥♥♥ and Reddit. It's pleasing art style and audio presentation only help maintain the charm that this game has. I realise I've mentioned the word 'Charm' twice within the same paragraph, and I guess that's the overal feeling towards this game. It's charming.\n\nIt manages to hook it's way into you and before you know you've finished the game, laughed at the various Pop/Cult References you've seen and come away feeling like you need to tell other people to 'just sit back, play it and tell me what you think'.","February 4, 2014","true","3.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/206370/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","Don't let other reviews fool you, Tales from Space: When Mutant Blobs Attacks bears only a superficial resemblance to Katamari Damacy. Whereas the later could be described as the ultimate chill game full of wacky Japanese humor, this is more of a traditional puzzle-platformer based around using your weird mutant blob powers to avoid ever-present death. "Eating" is only present as a way to bypass roadblocks in your quest to get from point A to point B.\n\nFirst of all, check the amount of time I've spent into this game and divide that by two: that's a good estimate on the amount of time you'll invest. I'm a completionist who spent way too much effort trying to complete some of the more frustrating jumps, hence why it's over five hours. Check with other reviewers if you don't believe me: Tales from Space: When Mutant Blobs Attacks is quite short, undoubtedly the shortest game for me to complete in my library. Compounding this problem is how little there is for you to do: apart from the jumping around and a dive move, you only have three gameplay mechanics. Shoulder buttons control the Magnetize and the Telekinesis powers, and on certain stages you gain rocket powers. The game is imaginative enough in finding enough challenges for these abilities but compared to other products from Lunchbox Games (and particularly Guacamelee), this seems incredibly limited.\n\nEnjoyment of the actual product is a mixed bag. On one hand, I really want to congratulate the person in charge of the physics engine. From the soft physics of your mutant blob to the inertia produced by your rocket travels to the orbiting of magnetic bodies, everything feels great. If there's a failing, it'd be in the actual platforming. 97% of the time it works fine (if not a bit floaty); it's that last 3%, the jumps required for some of the hidden blob friends that are simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's so frustrating looking over the solution online, know what you have to do, then fail repeatedly because the theory doesn't follow practice. I'm not going to downvote a game for a couple of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t jumps but it needs to be said that some platforming depends on ridiculous edge-of-platform running jumps that simply don't work, or a "magnetized-bouncy-super-high-jump" technique... Yeah, this review doesn't make it easy for the prospective buyer to understand so let's just leave it at "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t jumps".\n\nThis game is both easier and more frustrating than Guacamelee. Those who've played the lucha libre Metroidvania will get to reexperience the furious shoulder button pressing extravaganza needed to bypass treacherous areas all over again. Puzzle-wise you have your blob use its telekinesis powers to move platforms around, the solution to which shouldn't take more than a few minutes to discover. There's very little replay value because the game offers so very little in the first place: Tales from Space: When Mutant Blobs Attacks has the least amount of Achievements in my library and only offers a leaderboard in terms of additional content.\n\nI never paid any monies for this product, having won it off the Steam winter auction at a little over 1000 gems. I'd say its value comes more as an interesting physics engine for a blobby protagonist than as a puzzle-platformer anyways. Don't pay more than five dollars for it and you shouldn't regret anything. It's not bad or anything, just unsatisfying. You could say that it still left me hungry.","January 3, 2015","true","5.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It also packs in more indie game references than possibly any before it, which had me grinning the whole way through as I saw my favorites reimagined in very amusing ways. What's more, none of this comes at the cost of great levels or mechanics. Although it shows obvious influence from games such as The Maw and Katamari, Mutant Blobs carves out its own niche in the platforming genre with consistently clever design that feels wholly unique. Again and again it defied my expectations which is by no means something I say often.\n\nOther than a handful of times I had to wrestle with the controls, there is virtually nothing I dislike about Mutant Blobs Attack. It's hilarious, polished, and most of all a ton of fun.

The blob utilizes all that it is capable of, including its platforming skills and low viscosity in order to maneuver through various areas of different shapes and sizes. It even later uses magnetism and telekinesis to manipulate terrain. The game provides over twenty-five levels spread through six areas to play through. (This level count includes a number of minigame levels, which are notably shorter than main levels.)\n\nThe game is satisfying to play. Despite the fact that the blob never talks or expresses thought, players will still connect to the amorphous creature - its progressive growth, guided by the player, makes the player feel somewhat like a parent to the creature. Further satisfaction comes from being able to easily devour objects which were insurmountable in earlier worlds. Bright colors and a bouncy soundtrack layer the game into being a cartoon-like experience. This shouldn't be conveyed as a turn-off to older or more mature gamers; rather, it should simply mean that the game is lighthearted.\n\nGameplay functionality varies between game modes. The majority of levels, the side-scrolling platformer sections, are effective. Controls are tight and responsive, leaving the majority of blame for damage on the player. Wall-jump mechanics are a noted exception, though this does not hinder core gameplay much. Airborne sections of the game are less effective. The propulsion systems on the character are too imprecise for slight movement, which when combined with obstacles that require finesse to maneuver around leads to frustrating experiences in this mode. The third game mode, the top-down mode, functions well, and its visual differentiation from the rest of the game just makes these sections even more pleasing than they already are.\n\nFor how much fun this game is, it will not last. The whole game can be completed in around three hours. Additionally, the game is quite easy throughout. For the few sections which provide ample difficulty, players will receive a notification from the game with a tip - even further simplifying the game, despite being a useful mechanic. The single-player campaign is the only mode in the game - having some sort of multiplayer mode, whether that be in the form of competitive races, a vs. mode, or co-op levels, would have increased the longetivity of the game significantly. Some replayability comes from retrying the levels to earn gold medals or find the two blob friends that are hidden in each area, but with only 24 levels the experience could become monotonous for some players. With such an easy difficulty and a cartoony interface, younger players may find the best experience with this game.\n\nMutant Blobs Attack is a great game that's been reduced to a good game. With such little material contained in the game itself, gamers should consider whether their money is spent better with a lengthier experience. For what this does contain, though, it is a gratifying adventure that will stroke the supervillain in players and will entertain throughout its duration.

On his way to do so the blob automatically absorbs everything that is smaller than him and so he is getting larger and larger and is able to absorb even more.\n\nOver the course of the game you gain new abilities like smashing, telekinesis, magnetism and sometimes you can even fly around. Combined with the six different themed world stages and the never stopping growth of your blob the game never gets to repetitive besides it simple basic gameplay idea. The puzzles in the game are fairly easy what I did not really mind. The platformer part on the other hand is a bit tougher mainly for one reason. Besides the blob being a blob, and therefore precise movement can be a bit tricky, the controls are unusual. I have read some complains about them, because the game contains parts where you have to use the mouse. People playing the game solely on keyboard or gamepad have to shift over what can be annoying (Edit: This has been changed since the initial released and the game is playable with gamepad only by now). Personally I played the game one hand on the keyboard and the other one on the mouse. This combinations works pretty well. And even if you die you will start by one of the nearby checkpoints. Normally you should pass each passage with less than five times dying except you are trying to get the gold medals or you are collecting your blob friends.\nThose unusual controls are a left over from the porting because the game was made initially for the PS Vita. Another leftover are the mini-levels which are a lot easier in the PC version but still fun. The graphic is cartoon-like and colourful and fits the theme of the game. The music is nothing special. It does not really stand out but it does not annoy you as well. The game took me eight hours for completion of all achievements and replaying some of the levels for getting better times in the leaderboards. And for that the price tag is really fair.\n\nAll in all Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack is a really, really fun and colourful game if you can forgive some sometimes clunky controls and you do not mind the repetitiveness of the basic gameplay idea. Obliteration of mankind can be so enjoyable.","November 11, 2012","true","40.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

That said, the art design is great, creating a fun and interesting visual look that takes what could easily be a bland looking game and pushes it above other budget titles. The developers found the look that worked for them and took full advantage of it.\n\n+/- Controls are fairly basic but control well. Rarely did I ever feel that I failed because the game didn't respond to my inputs correctly. Basic platforming is fun and responsive, but while the game adds some variety to basic gameplay, never really grows beyond its basic premise.\n\n+/- Puzzles and minigames give you some breaks from traditional platforming. The minigames are well done, if way too easy, as they re-imagine the game as an 8 bit top down arcade game. Despite the great twist on visuals and gameplay, there literally is zero challege to them other than "how fast can you complete it" with no fail states. Puzzles are likewise fairly easy and quite repetitive, basically moving some platforms about to block/avoid lasers. While they are fun the first time, they quickly get tiresome.\n\nTL:DR - a fun, if short platformer that isn't worth full price, but grab it when on sale if you like indie platformers with alot of charm.","January 6, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Conquering an area is followed by a little newscast vignette, showing those yet to be consumed in increasing stages of panic. Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack creates the feeling of playing an old horror movie complete with dust-cracked edges (just like the CRTV you'd have to watch it on). The bonus levels delve further into this 'blast from the past' aesthetic by mimicking older game experiences. The change of play style that the bonus levels offer is also a welcome change of pace from the series of similar set pieces positioned around the very basic goal of growing larger and moving to the right.\nThe game has a keyboard and mouse control scheme that is more than functional, but clearly it was designed around a console as a controller offers greater precision. Oddly enough, there is still one mechanic that the mouse served better for which makes the ability to switch between the two control schemes on a whim an absolute boon. The point system is similarly flexible as it presents an incentive to be meticulous and thus makes things more difficult without punishing players that choose to take an easier way out. The 'beat my high score' mentality this creates gives the short game some much needed replayability.","April 11","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every level never lacks it’s predecessor and doesn't necessarily increased difficulty but increases the amount of skills required to past the level. I never found myself bored with playing the levels, nor did they become repetitive. Yeah the entire point of the game is to eat things to grow in size, but the game has a nice balanced of eating things and puzzles.

I like how the levels have you starting off as a small blob (so everything around you appears big) and every new level you unlock shows the world getting smaller (ie, you appear bigger). Airplanes, for example, look like toys later on.\n'So, iIs this the best thing ever ?', I hear you ask. No, unfortunately the controls are awkward at times.

The plot is as simple as the mechanics: absorb everything! From pretty much the beginning, you are on a constant quest for things smaller than you so you can grow. You start out eating paper clips and hamburgers and end up with tanks and even larger things (no, I won't spoil it). It's basic fun, really. Especially when humans start noticing you and try to stop you.\n\nStill...though it has some not-too-easy segments, the overall isn't very challenging. Aside from the basic search-and-absorb and a slam down attack (if you want to call it that), you have magnetic powers that attract or retract you. It has some moments (think Mario Galaxy), but IMHO not really enough to carry the entire game. I played through it in 3.5 hours and kept playing mostly for the (hilarious) cutscenes, the billboards with winks to other games and the music (which is great).\n\nOverall...I'd say it's about 7 out of 10. It probably doesn't help that I've played this after Guacamelee gold (which is Drinkbox's later game), which has stuff that I found missing here (like a boss fight here and there...and more a sense of growth in abilities).

As you get bigger, the world starts looking a little bit smaller and you go from absorbing crumbs to helicopters. The movement is wobbly but flowing and the puzzles aren't something you'll get stuck on.\n\nThe problem is that you've played this before. It's a physics-based, platform game with the odd puzzle thrown in for good measure. You start at one end of the level and you have to get to the other by unlocking doors/gates. You run, jump and use movement powers to get by. The fact you get bigger doesn't add much to the gameplay as you never 'feel' bigger as the levels zoom out and the blob's size seems to fluctuate between levels. For example, I spent most of the game going from 2m to 7m tall and back again until the last chapter where you sudden become 50m tall.\n\nSo it's all been done before and the main gimmick of the game isn't enough for it to be all that fun. Not to mention that the game is extremely short as I managed to finish it in 2 hours (each level is about 5 minutes long). It willl be longer if you really want to collect all the blue circles and other blobs but it doesn't give you anything except the feeling of completeness I guess.","July 5, 2015","false","2.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's like Katamari with added platforming puzzles. The difficulty ramps up as you progress, and some puzzles had me scratching my head longer than I'd like to admit. It's short and silly puzzling/guzzling fun as you grow your blob from a small, crumb-sized spec to something enspired by old movie monsters.\n\nA word of warning, you want to use the controller for this one. The keyboard controls are a bit of a drawback, as they require you to press many buttons in succession that are on opposite ends of the keyboard. The mouse dragging mechanics can also be a bit of a pain at times.

Of course, you have to play through the smaller sizes to get up to that point, but it's fairly fun. I do also like that the cutscenes and scenery have a nice sense of humour to them, it's really a mash up of 1950s era stylized cartoon infused with memes.\n\nThe biggest warning is that I played this on a laptop, and there's points of the game that are horribly suited to a touchpad, as there are a handful of levels where the mouse is extremely important. I do also wish it had been a little more consistent with the tasks of finding hidden blobs throughout the levels. Some levels I still don't know where they were, while in other levels you couldn't get past a section without having to pick up one of the other blobs. I'd rather the extremes be cut down upon on either side. Otherwise, it's a fairly entertaining game for 4-5 hours.","December 27, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Puzzles are well designed around gameplay mechanics, using the skills that the player acquires and forcing the player to reinvent and find new uses for those acquired skills. Save points occur often, which makes the game very forgiving of failure. The only thing that annoyed me was that by the end of the first few levels the blob gets so big that it becomes capable of devouring tanks, which I thought was awesome, yet when the next level started it seemed to be smaller again. It feels like the designers had a very cool idea that involved the gradual growth of the blob's size that got abandoned during production. I played it with an X-Box controller which worked fine.","December 23, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing like a 2D Katamari, you journey as an adorably grim blob out to have revenge for its tortured blob comrades, and you do so in some gloriously well paced and charming ways. While there are puzzles to be found in this physics platformer, none pose more than a few minutes of challenge to figure them out, as the main draw is simple catharsis of consuming the planet. There is a bit of challenge to be found in the secondary task to find your friends (and eat them), but most can be found fairly easy and only occassionally serve any real challenge. Making this sound like a bad thing is rather foolish of me, as this game is meant to be enjoyed for what it is. Given how this is pre-Guacamelee Drinkbox, I loved seeing their roots and their love of reference-filled billboards clearly has been an ongoing gag of theirs. This game's main draw for the hardcore is speed and time attacks, but I was never really compelled to do so, as I had far too much fun seeing what weird things I got to eat next. Play this game for the experience and the charming cutscenes, but don't expect much else outside of the main storyline. It's worth the short playtime, I assure you.\n\n(Note: I played this game while my power was out, so my play time is a bit inaccurate.

A game I got in a humble bundle a while back and never really thought much about, might just be the most fun I've had playing a platformer in recent memory.\nWhat I would say this game does right is variety. Tales From Space's level design always has something a little different to keep it fresh. Some levels almost exclusively use the rocket boost, which lets you fly around freely and others rely heavily on the magnets, which lets you stick yourself, and repel yourself from certain surfaces. This game gets level design right, by changing it up every couple of levels, and by introducing new elements and traps along the way. One world is a college, one a city, another in space, ect.\nTales From Space also has a real personality, the art and sound remind me of my favorite saturday morning cartoons. The music especially, some of which has a surf rock-B52s vibe, really made me smile. Overall is someone asked me to briefly tell them what I thought of Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack, I'd say it made me smile, and I'd absolutely recommend","March 9, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Due to its simplicity, slight escalating challenge, cartoony appearance, and lovely jazz soundtrack, this game's a great relaxation game to turn to after any stressful period.\n\nAs far as complaints go, the "Blob gets larger" theme goes throughout the game, but only really escalates in the last and first chapter. Everywhere in between feels more like filler as the blob constantly shifts from a mid-large size to a huge one. As such until the first and last chapters there's never really a real feeling of size as everything adjusts itself to you, so it never quite reaches that katamari ideal. The telekenisis power is a fun addition, but a bit finicky and hard to control on circular objects. But otherwise the game works beautifully and is an enjoyable short game.\n\nIf you need a quick nice looking game, you've got your mysterious blob right here.","January 27, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sounds simple enough, huh?  :)\n\nPros:\n+ Graphics (looks and feels as beautiful as you might hope it could from the screen shots, even on a modest machine!)\n+ The mechanics and physics (comfortable, intuitive and well behaved)\n+ Gameplay (enough differences between the levels to keep you interested, stimulated and challenged.)\n+ Difficulty (progresses in a friendly and carefully linear way: not too hard to upset a casual player, but a gamer who wants to get 100% will scratch their head until they hit that "Doh" moment when it all suddenly becomes obvious!)\n+ Sound (great soundtrack, but see below.)\n+ Multiplatform (Windows, Mac AND SteamOS/Linux comatible - I've mainly been playing under Linux.)\n\nCons:\n- Very hard to find anything bad about it, but perhaps there's not quite enough variation in the soundtrack sometimes if you're playing a bit of an addicted marathon - however, it's such a minor point it's not worth fixating on.\n\nIn summary:  I have nearly a 100 games in my steam library, but I just can't stop playing this one; hence I felt compelled to write my first steam review.  I can often measure the amount by which I enjoy a game by whether or not I just want to get to the next level OR whether I'm enjoying this level so much that I'm determined to clear it to 100% -- a rarity for me (as I don't often trying to fully complete games) Mutant Blobs definitely fits into the later category.  :)  Although I bought this game in a bundle, I would actually have been happy to pay full price.\n\nDefinitely recommended! :)","January 28, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact that the main character is a blob is pretty much where the similarities end though. Gish has a more elegant design, you control a physical object in all ways possible, angular momentum, rigidness, roughness etc and the whole gameplay was around that. Here things are more traditional. The controls are similar to any platformer except your character is a soft body. But this is a good thing! It means this game is doing its own thing, and succeeding, in my opinion.\n\nMutant Blobs is a very casual game that presents just enough challenge so you don't get bored. And most of the level design tries to throw fun things at you, I like that. Stuff that doesn't really qualify as a platform challenge or a puzzle, but it's still pleasuresome to do, like run through corridor eating stuff or get sucked into a pipe and watching the blob flow (reminiscent of Sonic loops and tunnels).\n\nI love how the game looks.

You're a Big, Green and Growing Alien Blob. Yet You're Still Cute.Genre: 2D Physics Platformer\nDeveloped & Published by: DrinkBox Studios\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, PS3, Xbox 360 and PS Vita.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nTales from Space: Mutant Blob Attacks is a side-scrolling 2D physics platformer where you take control of an ever-growing alien blob that consumes everything in its path. The main mechanic of Tales is the blob, which rolls around consuming objects and people in the level. This allows the blob to grow bigger and get past a series of obstacles on each level. It’s certainly a different mechanic from most platformers though I mostly have a neutral opinion on it. It works for this game. This is not a one-hit-die platformer so you can take multiple hits before popping. You’ll heal at checkpoints scattered about the level. The blob can also jump, smash to the ground as well as use telekinetic and magnetic powers to get around. All of which will be used to get past a series of increasingly-difficult series of obstacles. This helps keep the gameplay different each level. The main campaign is a decent feature of 24 fairly challenging levels. Every five or so levels are set in a differently themed area, featuring backgrounds with army bases, the moon and college dorm rooms. It’s cutesy and littered with references to other games, YouTubers and movies. The story itself is very limited, with some cutscenes only vaguely describing what’s going on.\n\nThe Platforming\nIt’s not my favorite kind of platforming. There’s a bit too much trial and error challenge for my liking as you try to get past obstacles using the game’s physics. I often found myself stuck in an area due to my own ineptitude and the game’s challenge. It doesn’t demand pixel-perfection such as the Giana Sisters but it does demand your attention. The twenty four levels almost outstay their welcome for me they do have a decent enough variety to keep them from being boring. I did find some of the telekinesis parts a bit overly frustrating though. However, the bonus levels that had you controlling the blob from a top-down perspective were pretty neat.\n\nPC Settings\n2D Platformers don’t need much to get by. But Mutant Blobs Attack has what it needs and then some. Music and Sound sliders are here. Controller vibration can be disabled. There’s a “CPU Performance” slider that goes low or high which will be useful for low-end rigs. A decent amount of resolution options, full screen and v-sync are here as well. Anti-Aliasing can be enabled/disabled. Otherwise, the game was very stable when I played it and I didn’t notice any issues. Music is a...weird quirky tune that fits in with the 50s aesthetic they went for. I’m not a fan of the 50s era aesthetic but it does work here. A controller is recommended for the best experience but keyboard and mouse is usable.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI personally didn’t enjoy my time with Tales from Space: Mutant Blob Attacks. This genre hasn’t been appealing to me much lately and Tales doesn’t change that. But, if you do like platformers, Mutant Blob Attacks is definitely worth getting. The platforming is very solid with plenty of variety for such a short title. Additionally, the charm it displays is hard to ignore. I’m not usually a fan of the 50s aesthetic but it works for this one. If you want something that’s cutesy yet still challenging, I don’t think you can go wrong with this game.\n\nRead this and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]","June 7, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This setup sometimes encourages you to explore, and sometimes you may have to solve a small puzzle to get stuff to absorb.\n\nThis game does have challenges though, you may have to avoid being hit by Army helicopters or tanks, or you may have to precariously avoid spikes, or you may sometimes have to outrun lasers, while performing other tasks, such as collecting objects to absorb or rotating something to pass.\n\nAnother mechanic are the powers, you can have Rocket Boosts, which offer air mobility, sometimes to collect out of reach items or escape a laser. You also have magnetism, which helps you attach to surfaces and avoid obstacles. Then you have telekenesis, which let's you open up paths, move objects, or launch yourself.\n\nThe music in this game kinda gave me a Rayman Origins feel at times, I have no idea why, but it was enjoyable to listen to. The graphics vary in style, one minute, you can go from an 80's/90's style to a pixellated style.\n\nThe game overall is kinda short, even if you try to get all the achievements and 100% the game. This game overall gets a 9/10, the only part that could be improved is making the game a bit longer.","March 23","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kid absolutely loved being a blob and eating carbage but the difficulty rose very rapidly for her after around 1/4th of the game. For seasoned gamers it's a walk in the park though.","April 22","true","5.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
