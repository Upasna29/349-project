"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ophoria/recommended/256290/","ophoria","snowdrop","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ophoria/","676 products in account","Essence\nIf you want to play something that has amazing style, is über-cute without being childish in the wrong way, is a light platformer combined, very light puzzler, with a light rpg element with simple yet still interesting enough turn based combat in the style of Final Fantasy and many other games, then this is exactly what you have been waiting for. Especially for the low original price they're selling this gem on release - must be the best spent money pixel-for-pixel in it's genre.\n\nChild of Light is perhaps one of the best entry points I have encountered for many aspects of computer gaming, all wrapped up in an exclusive sheet of paper with close to perfect execution.\n\nSession\nMe and an unexperienced friend that does not play computergames, 30 years old, played CoL for 6h straight. While being an avid gamer/developer myself I enjoy introducing other people to new experiences in the world of games, hence I controlled the wisp while he/she controlled the protagonist in a local co-op using gamepads on a 55". We played the win-version from Steam.\n\n\nGOOD\n\nVisuals\nCoL's style is a hand crafted treat for the eyes and looks like something taken directly from a printed high quality western fairy tale. While not for everyone the cuteness, fluidity and richly illustrated world will make most people instantly fall in love with what is presented: The aestehtics do not leave much to wish for.\n\nLanguage\nCoL is also written in the style of a rhyming childs book, which is just adorable.\n\nSound\nVoice acting in form of story teller between certain events sound very good and fit right in. Voice acting is however not there for character dialogues, but the game does not suffer from it. Music is high-quality and well integrated with the mood of the scenes.\n\nDLC\nMany that seem to know nothing about the game are whining about there being DLC:s released for it already and call it a rip off. Be insured that this is not the case at this current time.\n\nThe DLC:s are not win-to-pay or antything that is actually needed or improves the game or it's flaws in any way. Some of the are cosmetics, while others give you basic stuff you are free to very easily find in game through exploration used to buff your stats. Exploration is natural and not tedious or a punishment. I'd even claim that it's the other way around. (Compare it with if Nintendo  started to sell mushrooms for super mario games...)\n\nLastly there is also one DLC that actually adds a quest and an unlockable party member: It is great that this is offered for those deeming it worthy and interesting to have that option. Yes, they could have incorporated all of this for the original price in the initial release of the game, but they didn't, maybe in order to cover for the low price of the game, or maybe because all of it is not needed at all in the game. Needless to say, the argument that x could be included since the start can always be used no matter how much the devs have put in originally. It seems people never get enough and also always complain when somebody offers options which they themselves are supposedly not intersted in.\n\n\nLESS GOOD\n\nThe following points will not matter for the general publich that will play this game: The target group for CoL is not role playing nerds like myself coming from Dungeons & Dragons et.c. With that written, this might still be of interest for those of us that are experienced gamers as we will surely notice:\n\nEasy\nCoL is easy for experienced platyers if played on the casual difficulty setting: You can relax while playing and still enjoy it, but won't get any feel of urgency until you are at least more than eight hours into the storyline. There is however an option to change the difficulty to expert. For non-gamers the casual settings is perfect though.\n\nManual\nThe manual is minimalistic, takes 3 minutes to read, and explains only the very basics that you would figure out yourself within a maximum of an hour of gameplay anyhow. It does not explain the more technical aspects of the game, like for example questions in the style of:\n\n"What is the size limits of a party?"\n"How is xp divided between party members if they (don't) participate in combat?"\n"How else is xp earned?"\n"What's the limitation in quality of what can be crafted?"\n\nMy guess is developers don't care with manuals since the assume, quite correctly, that most people will never even open them and that the need of them is somewhat negated by in-game tutorials. While true to some extent, manuals are still something that I believe that we as gamers should demand when purchasing a game.\n\nMap\nThe quality of the in game map does not match the aesthetics or overall design of the rest of the game, nor is it's function sufficient even if the game isn't a maze or grandiose scope. It lacks local maps, zoom, and pretty much everythin you'd expect except fasttravel.\n\nCo-op: Local only\nWhy, oh why, is this not playble via the net when it's released 2014? Granted it wouldn't be used as a uniqe selling point, but still: If co-op is put in it should also offer the mode via the net even if playing with a person next to you is usually a nicer experience, should one be so lucky to have a gaming partner with the time and desire.\n\nCo-op: Passivity\nThe second player controlling the wisp has a clearly defined support role: He/she can heal, slow enemies, reach spaces easier, and is also indestructible. Issue is that the wisp seems to originally be an extended function of the main character. It works excellent when being playing it as single player and adds to the game, but when another player is expected to control the wisp he/she will in most cases feel somewhat limited and passive in relation to player 1 that controls the princess. Hence I do not recommend any gamer to actually play as the wisp.\n\nOn the other hand, this could also be a good thing if one wants to introduce a person to the world of games - letting them play a limited role will not overwhelm them, and can maybe lead to more curiosity and the urge to control the main character instead eventually.\n\nParty size\nWhen in turn based combat mode you never control more than 2 characters (ok, 3 including the semi-passive wisp..) from your party even  in cases where your party size exceeds that number. There is also a similar limitation to the amount of enemies you may encounter at the same time. Part of this is solvable by the function that allows you to call in and swap out one party member for another during any point in the combat (will count as an action though), so there is still ways to adapt and save party members.\n\nI'm not sure this has to be something bad even though I am sure many will percieve it that way. Personally I don't think "more of the same" and quantities of anything improves a game. In part the limited hero pool in combat even encourages the wiser use of tactics.\n\n\nU-play\nYups, you need to have it installed. Steam is not enough. Only thing good with this is that you will actually unlock extra fluff and game content in UPlay for the game by just playing it and completing quests.","April 30, 2014","true","23.1"," 206 of 243 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","206","243","0","9"

In this game you embark in a journey, playing as Aurora, a young princess whose soul is brought to the Kingdom of Lemuria. On this journey, you will have to recover the three sources of light and defeat the Black Queen in order to restore the Kingdom of Lemuria.\n\nGameplay\n\nIn terms of gameplay it is a good game but nothing impressive. The combat mechanics are pretty simple. However, you need to think you actions well in order to act in the best and fastest way as possible. At the start you will be a "lone wolf", but with time you will find many interesting and strong allies which will help you, by forming a party of 2 characters during the battles. You also have a firefly as an ally, which you control with the mouse. A pretty interesting mechanic but it becomes pretty repetitive during the combats. Out of combat it is an simple 2D platform game, with some puzzles, traps and tons of hidden loot. Sadly, in terms of combat, the game becomes extremely repetitive in the second half of the game because at some point, excluding boss battles, you will repeat the same tactics over and over again since the variety of enemies is pretty low. It gets so repetitive that at some point, you will start avoiding your enemies instead of attacking them to earn experience. You also have a perk system, as expected in a RPG, which is also pretty simple, yet intuitive. There is also a gem system called Oculi, that gives you the chance to upgrade certain stats of your characters.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=523396349\nStory\n\nThe story in this game is told in an extremely simple way, yet that is part of the beauty of it. It is a very sad story with some unexpected plot twists, supported by excellent characters and good dialogues, except the fact that they always rhyme, something that really grinded my gears, especially during the second half of the game because the rhymes start to feel too forced. Apart from that, it is an excellent tale of the journey made by the protagonist Aurora, in her attempt to save the Kingdom of Lemuria.\n\nVisuals\n\nVisually this is an epic game. The game art is absolutely astonishing, it really gives life to this wonderful fantasy world. Everything as an immaculate aspect, it is hard not to like the artistic work made in this game. Another highlight is the fact that this game as the "feeling" that all was hand crafted, as if the game was drawn on a canvas. Really spectacular in this category.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=529131381\nLongevity\n\nI completed the game in about 9 hours, completing the main quest and almost all secondary quests (except one if I am not mistaken). It is not much for an RPG, yet this is one unique experience, with an indie feeling and reduced price. There is hundreds of loot and many other collectibles spread all over the world, so if you intend to complete the game at 100%, you should take around 12 hours.\n\nMusic and Sounds\n\nBut for me, the biggest strength in this game is the soundtrack. Absolutely amazing! The soundtrack combined with the art style of this game earn the price of admission by itself. It is hard to not be immersed in this awesome world with this wonderful combo of visuals and sounds. Simply astonishing.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=533051511\nSummary\nPros:\nWonderful visuals\nIntuitive combat system\nStellar soundtrack\nBang for your buck\nHeartwarming story\nCons:\nCombat becomes very repetitive\nMy personal score: 9.0/10\n\nThis game is a pure gem. Simple, yet amazing. Highly recommended to any RPG fans, as to 2D platform games fans. With a very affordable price, there are no reasons for you to not enjoy this unique experience.\n\n----------------------------\nAnálise em Português no site eyeoctane.org / Portuguese Review in eyeoctane.org :\nhttp://www.eyeoctane.org/analise-child-of-light/","November 1, 2015","true","8.5"," 102 of 109 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","102","109","3","6"

A tender and linear game with simple controls but deep systems.\n\n(Visuals)\nOne of the selling points of CoL is certainly its artsy visuals, masterfully implemented on the UbiArt framework, the same from Rayman Origins and Legends. The landscapes vary from dark sceneries to rivers of lava, but one thing that remains constant is the extremely high quality of the artwork invested onto all moments of normal gameplay and battle.\n\n(Systems)\nThe battle system is a very strong point of this game. Typical strategies from JRPGs are present, with strength or defense buffs and elemental weaknesses, but there is a huge focus on timing here. In a system similar to the ATB from classic Final Fantasies, allies and enemies need to wait until their icon reaches the casting bar to choose an action. The interesting part is that while the character is casting, its action can be cancelled by hitting it with an attack. Making the system even more deep, you can slow one or the other enemy by keeping your mouse pressed on it, to adjust things to your favor. This battle system demands a lot of focus and strategy to optimize your performance, and that is why I liked it so much.\n\n(Story)\nThe story is told in a very poetic way, and I consider it very soothing.\nThe narrative is made in form of poems: every single dialog in the game rhymes. It seems that bothered some people, but that didn't happen to me.\n\n(Conclusion)\nIts best points are the very well executed art style and the battle system, but the rest has close to no flaws too. If I had to name a flaw, I would say that CoL lacks the learning of new skills to expand the explorability of the overworld, like in a metroidvania game.","November 7, 2014","true","9.6"," 131 of 154 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","131","154","3","3"

I really wanted to like this game but the more I played, the more I discovered that something(s) were missing and was left hugely disappointed by the end of the game.\n\nPros- The art style is top notch.\n- The soundtrack is top notch and sets the mood with its melancholic undertones.\n- Story is simple but cheerful and gloomy at times.\n- Boss battles test how well you understand the combat.\n\nCons- Requires Uplay, if you hate it, you'll still hate it. It causes the game to become unresponsive at times and can lead to crashes.\n- Rhyming gets tiresome midway through the game. It's not horrible but it'll grind your gears if you grow tired of it so much so you'd wish they'd stop.\n- The battle system is just a shallow copy of the Grandia system and can be easily 'cheesed' with little thought for tactics and gets repetitive fairly quickly.\n- Combat is a mixed bag. It's fun early on but get extremely repetitive in the latter half. Early on I found myself willing to get into fights however later on I found myself avoiding it. That's a major red flag for anyone who considers combat to be the main aspect of a JRPG.\n- RNG is on the enemy's side as they get their 'chance' skills in regularity while you seldom get yours.\n- The characters 'classes' are too situational or down right useless. The most useful characters are Aurora (Light), Rubella (Damage dealer, health mage), Finn (Elemental mage), Trista (Damage dealer, protection mage) everyone else is just not good.\n- Party line up is too limiting, I often found myself repeating the same steps when it came to battles ad-infinitum. 1. Open up with Rubella, followed by Aurora, then stagger with Rubella and finish with Aurora, rinse and repeat or 2. Open up with Rubella, followed by Aurora, then stagger with Rubella, Aurora dies\get criticalled, switch out Rubella for Tristan, Revive or heal Aurora, switch back to Rubella, rinse and repeat. It almost feels like the game is begging for a 3 man line-up to spice things up and reduce the tedium of the constant switcheroo game. As it stands it's tedious to switch out members because they don't fit the situation.\n- The platforming controls aren't that great, running feels clunky and flying feels extremely stiff. It would've been wonderful if players were given the option of controlling Aurora with the dpad rather than the stick as using the stick just feels off for a 2d game with side-scrolling aspects.\n- Gems\Oculi are not a fully thought out idea, it's like a shallow copy of the Materia system from FF7 just not as good. 3 gems can be socketed into a character for attack, defence and talisman granting some actual or chance bonuses however they don't feel like a necessity or rarely pay off. 3 gems can be combined into one large gem which offers greater benefit but you often don't have enough gems to make large ones as they're hardly given out until near the end of the game.\n\nOversights- Can't reorganise your party line up outside of combat. If you made a mistake and one of your favoured members dies and had to be swapped out there's no way to swap until your next battle...this is stupid.\n\nNitpicks- Aurora's model doesn't fit the game at all. While it looks good it just doesn't mesh well with the visuals as it looks too 3d almost as if it was made to stand out from the others and looks odd.\n- Gems\Oculi are rarely given throughout the game and towards the end are generously dished out.\n- All consumables are found scattered throughout the world and the rate at which they are found is too sparse until the end of the game where you find abuntant clusters of items in short periods of time. It almost feels rushed in this aspect as with the oculi distribution.\n- Boss fights are not memorable especially the last boss they're just tedious for some reason.\n\nVerdictI really thought I would love this game but it feels somewhat soulless. Ubisoft positioned this game as a tribute to JRPG of old but for some reason it doesn't feel like a JRPG to me at all. The combat system is not memorable or engaging, the story while simple doesn't really hold up by the end. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game it's just not a good 'JRPG' as aspects which make a good JRPG are under developed or simply missing. Maybe next time...because, well it's Ubisoft, you know a sequel is coming.\n\nRecommended for those interested in a simple rpg.\nNot recommended for JRPG fans looking for a fresh take.\n\nPS: Steam please give us a neutral recommendation option.","May 18, 2015","false","14.9"," 435 of 591 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","435","591","11","23"

Its mysterious land of Lemuria is a faded watercolour dreamscape of floating cities, gnarled and twisted forests, ancient ruins and peaceful country villages. It really does look like a fairy tale brought to life. Exploring spooky forests, shining lights on secret doors, collecting wishes; you're basically playing through a charming storybook adventure. Completing the feel is the lack of dialogue- there's no voice-acting apart from in some book-ending expository cutscenes, with characters otherwise speaking entirely in text bubbles. And rhyming. Because everyone rhymes in fairy tales.\nOur heroine Aurora is the mischievous daughter of an Austrian Duke. One day she falls ill, slips into a coma and wakes to find herself transported to Lemuria. To return home all she has to do is recover Lemuria's Sun, Moon and Stars, stolen by the mysterious and nefarious Black Queen, Umbra, who seriously has it in for our heroine for reasons that slowly become clear over the course of the game. Her journey will lead her across a beautiful but dangerous landscape, with a motley crew of companions at her side.\nAs well as the gorgeous landscapes, character and enemy designs are terrific. Monsters are delightfully creepy. Wolves, ogres and spiders inject just the right amount of menace into the world, getting that sense of a formerly idyllic dream slowly invaded by a nightmare spot on. Balanced against these horrors are the charming cast, from the brave and forthright Princess Aurora herself to her jester companion Rubella and Capilli magician Finn. Child of Light's playful sense of humour is also ever present.The various regions and towns that you explore each have their own feel and atmosphere - unique and yet cohesively tied to the overall aesthetic.\nAurora's constant ally and companion is the firefly Igniculus, sent to help the Princess by the seemingly benevolent Forest Lady, who appears to serve the powers of Light. He's your guide, really, a sentient ball of Light popping up to give you advice and encouragement. Igniculus can also be controlled; you can send him flying off to collect floating 'wishes', which restore your health and mana.\nYou'll explore Lemuria from a 2D viewpoint, with much of the non-combat action feeling like a simple platformer. Quite early on you unlock the ability to fly, which opens up levels for exploration and generally adds to the floaty, dreamlike atmosphere of the game. Most of the enjoyment of travelling around the world comes from zooming about discovering secret areas and items, of which there are many.\nRun into an enemy while exploring, or flying, and you'll zoom in to take part in some good old fashioned turn-based battles. Child of Light utilises an action bar mechanic that will be familiar to anyone who's played Final Fantasy before.Combat may seem simple at first, but you quickly realise that simply relying on basic physical attacks isn't a viable strategy. It's important to have an idea of what your plan is, and to get your timing exactly right. There are also several special actions that increase your options.\nYou control just two characters in battle, but switching in a new one is a free action. The best fights have you juggling your team in an out, de-buffing with one and dishing out the damage with another. Each character has their own skill tree, with three or four branches.\nWhile a briefer experience than most RPGs, Child of Light's shorter running time is actually not a bad thing. While promoting the game the development team described their aim as providing a brief but memorable adventure, like a couple of evenings spent reading your favourite storybook as a child. That's exactly the feeling I got, the sense of charm and wonder never allowed to grow stale with a bloated run-time. It's refreshing to play a game so confident and singular in purpose.","July 24, 2015","true","32.1"," 97 of 110 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","97","110","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mongolrising/recommended/256290/","mongolrising","Chicago Falcon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mongolrising/","346 products in account",":edit: I've finished the game so I can flesh out this review a bit.\n\nThe first great thing about this game is the artistic aspect.It was pretty obvious how amazing this was going to be even before this game came out and Ubisoft definitely lived up to my expectations. The artwork is very beautiful and very pleasing to the eye. You don't want to rush through but take time to enjoy the visual aspect of the game. The aesthetic side also extends into every part of the game, from the way the main character moves to the beautiful orchestral music. I definitely plan on getting the OST if/when they release it.\n\n:EDIT: Someone in the comments just told me where to find the OST. Apparently, the music was done by the Montreal artist Cœur de pirate and you can digitally download it from her site for a little over 8 USD here: http://musique.coeurdepirate.com/album/child-of-light\n\nThe story is another amazing part of the game. I've read a few reviews that try to knock it because "its just a fairytale". While this is obviously true, it doesn't detract from the game in the slightest. Ubisoft does a brilliant job of telling a story that, yes, in its simplest, most watered-down form, is just your typical fairytale. There are no real plot-twists, or at least, there are none they try to hide from you. It does have the "evil stepmother" trope and magic and princesses and all the things fairy tales do have. The game, however, fleshes out the story so thoroughly and beautifully that the result is more than satisfactory. The characters are all developed as far as could be expected for the format of the game, and poetic telling of the story just adds to the overall effect. The only other game that is really similar is Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, another fairy tale beautifully told. In the end, the story is as satisfying as the artwork.\n\nThe only thing I was worried about going into the game was the combat. I am not a fan of JRPGs or turn-based combat but I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the combat immensely. If I played it again, however, I would have played on the hard difficulty since the combat is rather easy and I only found it challenging once or twice. I never lost a fight and I only had a few characters die during a battle and that was only towards the end of the game during boss fights. If you dislike JRPG combat, don't let that stop you from enjoying the game...putting it on normal difficulty will allow you to enjoy the story without worrying about the combat. But if you like JRPG's or just want a challenge, definitely play on hard. You'll have to make more use of all the powers your characters have, especially their defensive and buff abilities. In addition, on a harder difficulty you will have to make more use of the gem system in the game, which provide passive abilities for each one of your characters.\n\nOverall, this game was well worth playing. It took longer than expected (10 hours) and was a beautiful and relaxing experience. It rivals Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons for the most beautiful indie game (yes, I know its Ubisoft, not technically indie) as well as my favorite indie game. It also shows what big gaming studios can produce when they try and hopefully points to a better future for gaming.\n\n\n\nAnd to anyone who decided not to get this game because of UPlay or because of "first day DLC". The only DLC in my opinion worth getting is the $2.99 one that unlocks the Golum character. His powers are unique and helpful so he is worth getting. Everything else is aesthetic or unnecessary, including all the little DLC's that give you gems...you find so many of them in-game, they're unnecessary. The experience of the game is complete even without the Golum so they didn't chop out a huge part of the game and then sell it to you as extra. Don't let it stop you from getting the game. And if you don't want to play it because of Uplay, I don't know what to say to you. You're just losing out on an amazing game because you don't want to deal with a piece of software that works pretty much smoothly and really causes no problems at all. At least, I've never had a single problem with them and I enjoy the rewards you can earn as you progress through whatever game you're playing.","April 30, 2014","true","12.3"," 161 of 204 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","161","204","0","7"

The gameplay is turn-based with a gimmick in the form of a "speed" bar that will determine who attacks first, who manages to block or disable another, etc. Buffs and debuffs are available to speed you up, slow down enemies, block enemies from being capable of disarming you, etc. An interesting gimmick and well executed. One thing I found however was that there was a serious lack side quests, adding to the game's shortness (there's perhaps three "main" side quests I counted, all of which can be easily completed within less than ten minutes).\n\nThe draw here is definitely how unique it is from a visual and storytelling standpoint. As stated, every single line of dialogue rhymes which I have to commend the writers for. Graphics-wise, the game looks like a beautiful watercolor painting. That said, one criticism I personally have was that with the exception of Aurora and a handful of other characters, all animations looks to be done in flash with serious tweening abuse, which I felt somewhat cheapened the experience (though that's likely my inner art snob talking, so take that with however large a grain of salt you will). It does cause some dissonance beside the rendered model of Aurora as well which was initially difficult to see past. These are minor complaints however. This game is gorgeous, the characters are lively and likable, and the soundtrack is amazing. Definitely worth owning.\n\nI do need to point out one final thing however, as this might be a deal-breaker for some. You WILL be forced to download Uplay. It doesn't matter if you launch the game through Steam, it will still automatically open Uplay. I've yet to encounter any problems other than being annoyed by the extra program running, however it might be worth your time to check out other reviews and the experiences other players have described before you make your final decision. There's been a lot of complaints about problems with save files or the game not launching.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/256290/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Child of Light is exactly what the creators at Ubisoft Montreal intended it to be. It is a beautiful piece of gaming, with amazing visuals courtesy of the UbiArt engine, a soundtrack that can only be described as haunting, and the storybook tale of a young girl named Aurora, trying to return to her father, an Austrian Duke. The land of Lemuria, where Aurora finds herself, is fantastical and a blast to explore, and all of the dialogue in the land is completely in poetic verse. Every RPG player who has even a little bit of childlike wonder left in them should definitely take the game for a spin. But beware, a fairy tale story is just that: a fairy tale. Don't expect epic character development or combat.\n\nThat being said, Child of Light doesn't need to be epic to succeed. Aurora's journey is one of simplicity; she does not wish to defeat a great evil, nor fight for a crown — she simply wants to see her father again. To do so, she must rescue the moon, sun, and stars — apropos goals for this type of adventure. Throughout her journey, she meets plenty of allies who fit the fairy tale mold; a circus performer looking to join her troupe and an anthropomorphic archer mouse who wishes only for the heart of his beloved are some of the first to join the party. Each and every character speaks in a rhyming verse, and while this is certainly engaging to read, I can't help but think that some of the lack of character development comes from the unique structure. While all of the characters have their moments, many seem to lack depth beyond simple quips that carry the meter.\n\nStill, this young girl's journey is one that is worthwhile, and it's backed by some of the best 2D visuals I've ever seen combined with a brilliant score. To say that Ubisoft Montreal has created a visual masterpiece wouldn't be hyperbolic; the watercolor-like portraits and sweeping vistas are complemented by a strong artistic vision. Environments like dark forests and the innards of a giant golem kept me exploring, but I wanted to see what I could do around every corner. Each place Aurora visited made me sit up and listen to the music.\n\nBeauty does come with danger, however, as fire, spikes, and other danger await Aurora as she flits about the 2D landscapes. While Aurora can fly almost immediately upon entering Lemuria, some of the platform elements are frustrating. I've never been a fan of damage or status effects being inflicted outside of battles, something that frustrated me to no end in Bravely Default, and I died without ever entering combat more than once. To be completely fair, some of this was simply a lack of care on my part, but I never felt like these sections provided anything to the journey. Had I simply solved a puzzle or continued along, the experience would have been almost identical.\n\nThe combat is more satisfying, with its combination of elements from Final Fantasy X and Grandia. If you've ever picked up GameArts' Grandia games, combat will feel like second nature: a gauge runs the bottom of the screen which displays when characters will act. Once a command is selected, the icon runs through the cast section until execution. Depending on the power or type of attack, the cast time might be incredibly brief or very long, but commands of both friend or foe can be interrupted if they are attacked while casting. In Grandia, timing often felt a bit random, but Child of Light improves it with the use of Aurora's firefly companion, Igniculus. Controlled with the right analog stick (or a second player), activating him on enemies will slow them down, allowing the chaining of interrupts. His power isn't infinite, though; it must be recharged either with items or by moving him to plants that exude energy to absorb.\n\nThat's not the only depth in the combat, though, as only two party members can be on the battlefield at any time. When it's any character's time to act, they can swap with another one of the various party members. Elemental weakness is important in Lemuria, so going up against a group of fire enemies means you'll probably want to switch to the characters with water-aligned abilities. The battle system is entertaining enough, though I did start becoming tired of it after a while.\n\nTo take advantage of the different elements, planning outside of battle is important. Different gemstones, called oculi, provide unique bonuses and elements when they are equipped, and I made sure to have a character on hand with fire, water, and lightning as their primary attack elements. Some gems have less traditional bonuses, like being able to manipulate the action gauge. Three gems of the same type can be combined to create more powerful versions. This, alongside the three-pronged skill tree for each character, provides enough customization to make each character feel sufficiently unique.\n\nIt's very clear just how much care and thought went into the development of Child of Light. It might not be a vanguard experience for fans of the genre, but there's enough depth to keep veterans interested. The charming story lacks a bit of depth, but with enough going on to tug at the heartstrings, it's easy to recommend Child of Light. As long as you can remember a time in your childhood where everything felt new and beautiful, there's an enjoyable experience to be had.\n\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 24, 2014","true","78.4"," 80 of 104 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","80","104","3","3"

The gameplay is a throwback to older JRPGs with an action timeline where being attacked during a cast can see you interrupted and thrown back: this means good planning and timing- not to mention a judicious use of your skills- will go a long way towards making combat easier.\n\nThe game suffers a bit in complexity though as the actual RPG elements are a bit shallow: each level up sees you getting a point to spend on a branching skill tree but most unlocks are just passive bonuses, loot and equipment are also very basic and are basically only gems to slow in one of your three equipment slots and a few potions. The story is failry interesting but most characters, villains included, feel a bit too two-dimensional to be memorable and this mars the narrative a bit: there's enough to move the plot and make you want to see the ending but that is all.\n\nDespite its basic gameplay and somewhat forgettable story Child of Light is still a game to recommend due to its interesting combat mechanics and gorgeous art: if you somehow missed it or it's still part of your backlog then know it's a game worth your time.","December 8, 2015","true","8.3"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","0"

Tuck yourself in bed\nLet me tell a story\nOf Lemuria, a kingdom past,\nAnd a girl born for glory.\n\nChild of Light tells the story of Aurora, a daughter of an Austrian duke who finds herself transported into the land of Lemuria. She soon discovers her destiny is to recover the sun, the moon and the stars, for she is 'born for glory'. Through this tale Aurora groups with a diverse range of characters, each with their own tales and struggles. The land of Lemuria has grown dark, and in this world you fight on in search of your father, who has become ill and is dying. Very few games create such an emotional and memorable experience in story telling quite like this. Child of Light is nothing short of a masterpiece.\n\nChild of Light is a turn-based, role-playing-game that has a strong emphasis on exploration, atmosphere and lore. There is tonnes of collectables hidden throughout the world for you to seek out and collect. These collectables range from crafting materials to additional lore, which alike the game, takes form in beautiful poetic form. Child of Light has beautiful writing, whether it be in cutscenes or in simply talking to NPC's around the world; every piece of dialouge is artistic in every sense of the word.\n\nFew very games can truely be classified as artistic, in recent years it seems that a beautiful game is one that is graphically realistic, this is not the case with Child of Light. This game is far more imaginative and inspired that any game I have played in recent years, and it shows. The art style for this game is very 'child-like', but in a positive way. It compliments the games narrative and atmosphere perfectly from beginning to end. Where Child of Light shines most however, is the soundtracks. From the heart-plucking moments to the up-beat boss encounters, every soundtrack is perfectly conducted and adds an entire new layer to atmopshere that is rarely seen in video games. Any moment a new soundtrack would kick in, I would pause for a moment and just listen. Whilst playing this game, I went so far as to just refuse any distractions that would remove me from the experience; an experience that beautiful, emotional and engaging.\n\nThe turn-based combat is also another truimph over games of it's genre, it's fluid, refreashing and requires strategy. In combat, you can control two characters at any given time. There is a bar, split into two sections, the 'wait' period in which all characters in combat will slide towards the 'cast' period at a given rate, depending on their stats. Once each character reaches the 'cast period, you can select a number of actions ranging from switching characters, casting spells, using potions or fleeing. There's a great deal of stategy involved and in many cases, especially boss encounters, the game can be quite the challenge. Once either all your characters are dead, or the two selected and out in combat die, the game is over and you continue from your last save. Battles are a rewarding experience because you're almost always guranteed for at least one character to level up, and from this, you can spend points into generous skill trees that differ from character to character.\n\nChild of Light is a simply amazing experience in every aspect. The lore is emotional and creative, the soundtracks are amongst the best in recent gaming and the gameplay is varied and rewarding. From the beginning to the end, you'll make decisions, you'll solve puzzles and watch Aurora grow on her journey. This isn't just a great game for it's price, it's a great game, full stop. I HIGHLY urge anyone who is interested in stories, role-playing-games or just looking for something new to pick this up and try experience it.\n\nBy the end of the experience, when your journey is complete:\n\n"Igniculus: Aurora, what is love known by?\n~Aurora: When it hurts to say goodbye."\n\nChild of Light is a masterpiece. Very few games offer such a complete experience in such an inspired form, and honestly, I'm finding it difficult to name a single game I've played, ever, that I've enjoyed as much as the experience on this. Child of Light isn't a game, it's art.","November 24, 2014","true","7.3"," 46 of 60 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","46","60","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/memphizzx/recommended/256290/","memphizzx","MemPhiZ ZX - #HeroesNeverDie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/memphizzx/","3164 products in account","My review for Child of Light:\n\nFirst of all, I'm going to address 2 concerns that I found in Steam community hub:\n1. Uplay\nThose who're going to buy this game should know that this game is going to use Uplay, Ubisoft own game client. I noticed that many people dislike Uplay for certain reason so gonna respect that. I have my own issue with Uplay as well. So if you want to buy this game, make sure you know what you're getting into.\n\n2. Day 1 DLC\nWhen the game is released, the dev put several DLCs immediately, including Golem DLC and Dark Aurora DLC which is the Special Edition bonus DLCs, Light Aurora DLC which is the preorder bonus and several "cheat" DLC which you can buy extra oculis for your game. Golem DLC gives you a new party member and a small quest to get him, while Light Aurora and Dark Aurora DLC give you skins for Aurora and extra oculis and bonus stats. The "cheat" DLC is actually consists of oculis, which means you can buy the oculis using real money once. Among these DLCs, only Golem DLC adds a bit of content while the skins just for eye candy. As much as I hate day 1 DLC, if you want to support the dev, buy the Golem and the skins DLC only. Of course you can ignore the DLCs if you don't want to support day 1 DLCs. I myself didn't bought any of the DLCs except Light Aurora since I preorder it.\n\nIn this game, you're playing as Aurora, a princess who died and reborn into Kingdom of Lemuria. Story progress smoothly, gaining allies and some plot twist. However, the ending is kinda not to say lame, acceptable but not much impact. There are no voice narration for this game except the narrator herself. Somehow, I wish that each character got their own voices to add more personalities to the characters. You can quite rush the game since the story is quite short. And you can restart again with New Game+ feature so you can start the game with OP Aurora.\n\nThe artstyle and graphic is beautiful. When you move Aurora around, you can see her hair move depends on the directions. The backgrounds and landscape are nicely drawn. Character animation during combat is kinda static. And the graphic glitch for Aurora’s hair where she transform into a tomboy during battle is not favorable by many, though I can deal with that.\n\nNow lets talk about combat. It's 2v3 style, where you can bring 2 members in your party to fight 1 to 3 monsters at a time. but you can only change party members during combat and not outside which is annoying. At least let the player decide which member goes on combat first. Before combat, you can only manage on the oculis to be equipped on each party members and use any skill points or healing items. In combat, there will be a timeline. Each member and monsters will be on the timeline. When you reach the casting point, you can give order to the said member ie attack, use item or switch party member. After selecting the action, there will be another timeline for casting. If you're attacked during this time, your attack will be cancelled and you'll be pushed back on the timeline which is also known as interrupt. You can also use this to your advantage to prevent monsters from attacking you. There are no visible health bar for enemies and no bestiary to see the weakness of each enemies so you have to discover it yourself, although some of them are kinda easy to spot. During combat, you can also control Igniculus, which is very useful in combat. he can highlight enemies and show it on the timeline. He can also slow down enemies by blinding them, making their progress on the timeline slower for more tactical approach. He can also heal you. To recharge his energy meter, he can either use potion or just shake the light source and collect the light.\n\nThere is oculi crafting in this game, which is combining gems to make different and stronger oculis. Only 3 recipes are showed in the game, others you have to discover yourself (we got internet though ;D). Each oculi type has different effect depending on where you equip it. There are 8 types of oculis; 6 can be found in chests and defeating monsters, the other 2 need to be crafted. There is only 1 secret recipe for a special gem, but other than that, just normal crafting stuff. I wish they had put more depth to the crafting part since it's the essential part in the game.\n\nEach character has their own skill tree. Each skill tree got 3 branches and you can focus on either 1 branch first or balancing between each branch. Each branch focus on 1 special skill for the character. Example for Aurora, she got Slash (physical attack), Light Beam (magic, light damage) and Super Light Beam (magic, light damage, can 1 hit KO) (Disclaimer: The skill name is not correct :P). Each skill will have single targeting or multiple. And no character has similar skills, so it's good to know which one you wanna use during combat. Unfortunately, there's no explanation about the skills during combat, which make it hard for players to choose skills. There's also passive skills available, like Counter-Attack, Counter-Heal etc and it helps very much during combat.\n\nThe soundtrack, is a masterpiece. I enjoyed every one of the songs. When I first started the game, I was stuck at the main menu because the song at the time, which is Aurora's Theme is mesmerizing. Even the songs during normal battle and boss fight is good and make me more enthusiastic to play. You can buy the digital album from here or you can listen to it on Spotify. Give it a go, I'm sure you'll like it.\n\nOverall, for the $14.99 price tag, it's totally worth the price. I still need to highlight that this game is not for Uplay haters and Steam elitists, because this game use Uplay as DRM so buying for Steam means using 2 DRMs at a time which is not acceptable for some people (you can see it in the community hub, people still b*tching about it lol). And Uplay is still in growing stage and need much more improvement. Other than that, this game is good and I totally recommend this game especially to RPG fans.\n","June 20, 2014","true","36.8"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","38","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/256290/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Child of Light is so staggeringly beautiful that it’s not uncommon to find its presentation entirely overpowering that game underneath.\n\nPastel colors swirl lushly through the environments, soft details illuminating a world lost in darkness, as wondrously animated heroines fly onward curiously taking in places as foreign to them as the player. Elegant piano melodies accompany you in the background, often joined by your own flute before coming to crashing crescendos when a fight inevitably breaks out. It’s the sort of all encompassing grace and artistry that it’s easy to become so swept up in it that when the game itself comes into focus it almost feels unnecessary, maybe even somewhat annoying as it pulls you out of your marvelling as you're asked to take part in tasks rather a lot less captivating.\n\nThat game revealed itself to be a turn-based RPG, rather surprisingly large in scope yet scaled down so as to encompass a game far shorter than those it borrows elements from. There are quests to clear, huge skill trees to unlock, an ever growing party to manage, items to craft, and limitless enemies to take on. It’s ambitions are at once impressive, and a tad overwhelming, giving you so much to manage and consider that I was rather quickly lost in a sea of items and unlocks.\n\nChild of Light is constantly giving you more stuff, but it doesn’t take long to see that much of it is superfluous, bogging the player down with perceived options while burying the ones you actually want. The intimidating skill tree quickly becomes much less so as the levels and skill points begin to roll in at a generous pace, but the reward you’re met with always feels intangible and minor. Points add upon points to stats that never feel important, informing you you’re apparently getting stronger but never feeling like you’ve actually grown.\n\nThe initially obscure crafting system spirals into inventory chaos, as you’re loaded down with materials that are more tedious to use than beneficial. Outfitting my party so as to broaden my elemental effect was only as useful as I was able to remember who was using what, in the continual swapping of materials as I attempted to build more useful items but inevitably ended up weakening someone in the process. The lack of any sort of guide as to the uses of different objects you can craft left me switching awkwardly between menus, testing loadouts before heading back in to actually make them. It’s convoluted and by the end I’d given up trying to make anything more from the system than I already had, hoping it was enough to get me through battles.\n\nCombat is one of the few areas that’s more often than not actively engaging, utilizing an interesting turn system that’s more reliant on timing than just beating enemies down as hard as you can. The idea is if you position enemies on the timeline so as to attack them when they enter the last portion and are preparing to attack, you can beat them back and effectively skip their turn, which if done properly can see you continually attacking without the enemy ever getting a word in. It’s the sort of turn system that requires you always be engaging and anticipating the enemy, and when paired with the various moves of your different party members and differing enemy weaknesses can give you a lot to think about and be really satisfying to succeed with.\n\nBut as with all of Child of Light, you’re given far more than its systems can sustain, with enemies constantly pouncing you at every moment. After a point I began to run mostly on autopilot, so accustomed to an enemies patterns that they were no longer threats, but obstacles standing between me and what I hoped would be new things to fight if only I could get through to the next chapter. Even boss fights which are easily the most imaginative and interesting fights in the game, become agonizingly slow sets of attacks as you whittle away at an enormous invisible healthbar even as the boss becomes entirely helpless.\n\nThe only place Ubisoft shows an amount of restraint is in Child of Light’s simple, endearing narrative which blends its fairy tale bedtime story with that of a young girl’s coming of age and learning how to deal with the responsibilities newly put upon her. It’s intentionally cliche at times, though in a way that’s comfortingly familiar, while still subtly subverting its tropes to allow a refreshing portrayal of a story you already know before it’s even begun. The choice to writing it entirely in verse isn’t as consistently successful, changing stanzas so often that trying to follow its rhyming is a small challenge, and the necessity of rhyming causes lines to sometimes read sillily or feel forced.\n\nChild of Light is an imperfect, exquisite creation, sometimes hard to love but yet difficult to pull yourself out of. I loved my time with it, even as I was becoming confused and annoyed at systems that often felt underdeveloped, finding trouble dismissing something so stunning and unexpectedly ambitious. It’s flaws are obvious and needing to be acknowledged, but I wanted so much not to, as my initial impression of unbelievably beauty continued to guide me through a game easily obscured by the creativity draped around it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","January 16, 2015","true","11.3"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","0"

By the book, but that's okay. The story revolves around Aurora, a princess who apparently died in the real world and woke up in the land of Lemuria, where the Queen of Night has taken the sun, moon, and stars. Very fairy tale.\n\nI've played the game almost to completion, literally being in the final area, and as I played this game something was bothering me. I couldn't figure out why, but I did not like the game. The music is fantastic, the battle system simple but complex in its nuances, the characters had character, and the environment was like flying through a painting. But I still didn't like it. I asked some friends, and one suggested that it was because it didn't form a cohesive whole, but that wasn't it. Then I finally realized why.\n\nIt's because the game is hollow; it has no soul. The characters are archetypes who never break out of their roles to become rounded, the story is strictly leading the player around in a linear fashion with no hidden depths to plumb, and the music fades into the background of notice when there isn't much variety to it. Child of Light is just a thin coat of paint on a canvas, something to look at, maybe remark on, but there is no meaning to the art and I therefore have no reason to play it.","May 11, 2014","false","14.5"," 143 of 234 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","143","234","0","10"

The narrative is mildly witty and fun at times, but can get annoying.  I liked it overall.  The art style and graphics to this game was top notch and extremely beautiful!  I loved seeing some of the backgrounds and caught myself just stopping to take it all in.\n\nThe difficultly wasn't too bad as long as you killed all the enemies you come across.  There are no random battles and you can see all the enemies on the screen and you don't have to fight any of them, but strongly discourage this due to not being able to kill bosses.  There wasn't any grinding for XP during my adventure.  If you kill all the enemies they stay dead until you turn the game off.  Once you turn the game off everything respawns.  So, if you want to grind you can.\n\nThere is no equipment upgrades in this game.  You don't have to worry about managing any loot.  There are stones that you can acquire from monster loot and treasure chests throughout the game though.  These stones allow you to customize your characters with minor stats IE: fire damage, water resistance, chance to crit, etc.\n\nThere are a total of 9 party members that you can play with, but only 2 usuable at any given time.  Each has their own flavor of strategy.  Some heal, some tank, some buff and some debuff.  You can swap out whomever you like as many times as you like.  It doesn't matter who is in the party all members gain experience in or out of battle.  That was great and allowed me to use other party member combos however I liked.  You have a tenth character named Igniculus you can use and he follows you around in and outside of battle.\n\nIgniculus is a ball of light companion that helps solve puzzles and grabs items out of reach outside of battle.  Inside of battle he is used to off-heal and slow down enemies.  You can only choose one or the other on the fly.  I normally chose to slow down the enemies.  He can also be used in crowd control outside of battle too.  You can CC every enemy in the game and while doing so you can simply just pass them up and not fight them.  Great for times you just want to advance the story and not have to worry about getting into any battles.\n\nThere's a lot of status effects during combat.  You can slow down enemies, speed up yours, add more armor and my favorite was the Unbreakable spell.  This spell made it so you never get kicked out of order during combat.  This imo was a must have spell and without it would had made the game quite a bit more challenging.  There are healing and reviving spells also and I'd recommend grabbing one of the DLC's that has the healing spell.  Yep, pretty stupid to have to buy DLC for a spell, but whatever I guess.  That's Ubisoft for ya!  :)\n\nThis game does require Uplay and I personnally don't have any problems with Uplay and doesn't effect my purchasing of any game.  Not one time did the game mess up, crash or have any problems what so ever.  So, don't let this bother you.\n\nIf you like games like Final Fantasy with some platforming and mild puzzle interaction this game is a must play.  Taking me around 15 hours to beat at level 49 it was fantastic and the asking price of $15 is totally worth it.  The game does go on sale a lot so grab it then if that's too steep.

And I did, but far less than I expected. I'm disappointed with the wasted potential of this game. I'm flagging my review as "not recommended" because I just wish Steam offered a neutral option.\n\nThe 2D art is beautiful. The soundtrack is pretty good. The cast is diverse, something that's rare in video games. The dialogue is all written in rhymes. The battle system has more depth than it seems.\n\nBut the game feels hollow and rushed.\n\nOne example I'm sour about is this one. When you acquire the power of flying, very early in the game, there is a really cool cutscene that makes flying seem really magical. And it's just right at home in the game's universe. It strikes the childlike chord of your heart. And then you're able to move. And your character flies in a *really* stiff way. The complete opposite of the cutscene. It feels like a slap to the face.\n\nAnother thing that grinded my gears is that the game doesn't really try to say anything (maybe except vague messages about motherhood). It's as generic as "good vs. evil" gets. And there aren't some cool story themes hidden between the lines as well. It's disappointing considering that besides the protagonist (who undergoes a really cool transformation two-thirds into the game), there is barely any character development at all. The story doesn't have any complex twist and turns either. You find yourself wishing the game had some sort of lore... anything at all that could give the story as much depth as the beautiful artistic direction has.\n\nThe battle system is really nice but there's a big difficulty spike out of nowhere halfway through the game that requires a bit of grinding to go through (one particularly annoying boss). That's really the only part which requires grinding. In this childlike gleeful universe, this doesn't feel right. You battle with two characters at a time maximum, and can switch between them. They all have a distinct set of skills, which is an interesting mechanic, because while I dreaded this at first, I think it feels better to rely on more than just two people ever. Some of them are too situational though.\n\nThe menu system, for inventory and leveling, takes you really right out of the game. It feels... insanely gamey and unintegrated, basically. It just cuts to complete silence, and it's kind of a pain to navigate through, especially when choosing your skills to level up. The skill "trees" (they're actually mazes on the menu!) are convoluted for no sensible reason. Nothing about the menu feels right at all. It breaks your immersion.\n\nAll in all, this game feels like a lot of wasted potential. Maybe Ubisoft didn't allocate enough resources or didn't let the guys have enough time. It's one of those games that really have something going for them but just don't reach for their opportunity, and it's heartbreaking.","August 21, 2014","false","13.4"," 133 of 223 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","133","223","0","7"

It's a word I've rarely found applicable where video games are concerned, but there's no better way to describe what Ubisoft has achieved with Child of Light. With its earthy, Art Noveau hand-painted art style and charming character designs, and unique combat system, it deftly brings the RPG landscape for the better part of a decade.\n\nThis feeling of warmth and sentimentality can be seen in every aspect of Child of Light, from the character portraits in the menus, to the lovingly detailed hit animations in battle. The net result is an experience that feels less like a power fantasy, and more like the cherished memory of a childhood bedtime story. In addition, the game could be finished between 10-11 hours or even faster. It's a short happiness but last long for years. It's worth it.\n\n\nGameplay/Combat System\nIts biggest success is the combat system, which skillfully mixes turn-based and real-time elements. Icons move along a bar at the bottom of the screen, indicating when you and your opponents get to act next. Scoring hits on an enemy who's winding up for a big spell interrupts them, canceling their move, and sending them back on the timeline. This creates a constant tension, forcing me to plan two steps ahead while looking for chances to interrupt, and keeping enemies from doing the same. That fusion of big-picture planning, and second-to-second awareness kept me feeling like a tactical genius battle after battle. Battles are also rewarding because of the steady clip at which your characters level up. After almost every battle, at least one of your characters advances, getting boosts to stats as well as earning skill points that you can use to unlock additional stat boosts or more powerful skills. Of course, it's fun to see your characters become stronger over the course of the game, but what makes Child of Light meaningful is the way that Aurora grows emotionally stronger. Eventually we have to leave the realms of fairy tales behind and face the challenges of reality once more, but Lemuria is the kind of fantasy realm that stays with you as long as you remain a child somewhere in your heart.\n\n\nGraphic\nStarting with one screen onto the next, Child of Light submits completely to its hand-painted aesthetic with Art Noveau style. Each stunning water-color backdrop looks ready to be framed and hung in an art gallery. That's not strictly because of the high level of overall quality, but also due to how warm the characters and environments all feel. Dark silhouettes of gnarled, ancient trees scroll through the foreground, adding a sense of depth to painterly forests, and oppressively dreary caverns give way to towering windmills amidst rolling hillsides. Each areas are breath taking, naturalistic beauty that words honestly fail to capture.\n\n\nWhat We Learned\nFairy tales may be works of escapism, but no fairy tale worth its salt is purely a work of frivolous fantasy. No, the best fairy tales simultaneously let children escape from the frightening realities of life, while also helping them confront those realities, teaching them that even though life is difficult and scary sometimes, they are capable of overcoming adversity and coping with loss. Child of Light is a fine fairy tale in this tradition, a fantasy that deals with the reality of what it means to grow up.\n\n\nReplayabilty\n50:50 will play it again, because there are so many another good Turn-Based RPG games out there, like Final Fantasy or Sid Meir’s Civilizations.\n\n\nVerdict\n7.8/10","October 14, 2015","true","10.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/recommended/256290/","Cantisque","Canti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cantisque/","2676 products in account","Ubisoft has done something truly special with Child of Light, a product that resulted not from trying to appeal to the widest audience or focus testers, but a product that genuinely conveys the heart of those involved in making it happen.\n\nYou play the role of Aurora, an Austrian princess who is trapped in the strange land of Lemuria trying to return home to her father. Along her journey, you will find various landscapes to explore, with secrets and collectibles hidden in every nook and cranny, a few optional side missions and a cast of endearing characters to aid you.\n\nGameplay is centred on the open exploration of the world, and a turn-based combat system.\n\nWhile not in battle, you will be flying around the various lands of Lemuria, manoeuvring through various terrain obstacles and simple environmental puzzles, searching for a way home (and treasure!) with your firefly helper Igniculus who serves to activate certain locks you can’t reach, light up dark caves and also to stun enemies with the blinding light he emits. Additionally, you will find various characters who will provide side quests or even join your party.\n\nThere are roughly 8 different party members, who range from a cowardly wizard, to a pair of jester siblings and provide entertaining dialog that is curiously written entirely in rhyme. While this is entertaining and sometimes impressive, it does make it more difficult to become emotionally attached to any of the characters, as a Shakespearean script is far from natural-sounding. Regardless, their personalities are still differentiated enough for each one to shine and leave a lasting impression and this should be considered a feat of writing on its own merit.\n\nThe combat system is an interesting take on the traditional turn-based JRPG-style combat. In a similar way to the ATB system in Final Fantasy games, your attacks are based on a timer. Once the timer nears the end, you prepare an attack, but if the enemy manages to spring their attack before you have launched yours, it causes your attack to be “interrupted” and sends your timer further back. Likewise, you can do the same thing to your opponents. Igniculus helps out here too, by slowing your opponents so their attack bar will fill slower, but also by healing you or your allies and grabbing health/mana when he can. It’s simple to learn, but feels very rewarding once you’ve managed to nail the fine art of timing your attacks. Other familiar RPG mechanics include elemental attributes, random loot and a variety of potions that restore health, mana and provide buffs.\n\nYou will participate in each battle alongside a party member. You can swap between other party members when your turn to attack comes without wasting a turn, meaning it’s very easy to adjust your strategy by utilising the various skills of your different partners. Each has a unique skill tree that expands as you spend ability points for levelling up through experience in battle. Some characters focus on damage, some focus on buffs or working in elemental benefits.\n\nEach part of Lemuria is a hand-painted masterpiece. The Ubi-Art game engine works the same visual magic as it did for the previous Rayman games, with a combination of high-resolution, 2D artwork spread over a multitude of parallax layers that results in every screen appearing unique from all the rest, with very few assets re-used. The watercolour artwork itself is both warm in its choice of colours and at the same time often melancholy, with ruined buildings and overgrown monuments in both the background and foreground hinting at a more peaceful past. The audio also adds to the atmosphere, with exploration music consisting of a few slow-paced piano scores, jumping to more frantic, orchestrated pieces during battles.\n\nChild of Light is let down only by its short length and by the plethora of “cash grab” DLC’s that were released at launch. But do not be discouraged, the game is presented in a way that uses every artistic medium available to it to craft an elegant presentation from an already highly competent game. It may be a short adventure, clocking in at around 10-14 hours for the core game, but the pacing of the story and diamond-like polish of the gameplay mechanics ensure that every hour is enjoyable while at the same time never overstaying its welcome.\n\nPros:\n~Beautiful eye-candy artwork from start to finish\n~Fantastic writing feels like you’re part of a storybook\n~Wonderful soundtrack\n~Perfectly balanced gameplay mechanics, challenging without being unfair\n\nCons:\n~Day-one DLC, including a locked party member\n~Animation on some characters appears cheap\n~Main game will be too short for some to justify the price","May 10, 2014","true","16.2"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","2"

Took me roughly 36 hours. Got all the confessions, collected all the coffers and stardust twice and completed all the side missions twice. The only items I used were Stardust and Revive potions.\n\nThe Good:\n- The artwork, if you’re into that look.\n- Combat, though at times it could be incredibly frustrating and it was basically just all about timing your attacks.\n\nThe Okay:\n- The DLC is all purely cosmetic or stat boosting (The Golem is an awful character by the way).\n- Not too many launch day bugs (as compared to other titles released by UbiSoft)\n- The story is simple, but decent.\n\nThe Bad:\n- In New Game + mode you couldn't speed past cutscenes. It drove me absolutely crazy that I had to listen to the dialogue over again.\n- The writing is just terrible. They force every sentence to a rhyming structure, and they don't even do that well.\n- The puzzles are simplistic in nature and few and far between, don’t expect anything that requires actual thought.\n- The crafting system, why does it even exist? It lacks any sort of depth, and the game is easily played on hard mode while ignoring it.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Uplay on launch day of course was acting up\n- Uplay on Watch_Dogs Launch day was acting up even worse\nExpect not to be able to play whenever Ubisoft launches a new title\n\nOverall:\nI really wanted to like this game since I'm such a huge RPG fan, but this felt as if it was designed for children. They released a patch within the month after release to fix some of the launch day bugs, but I never got to experience the game with that patch.\n\n\nEDIT: Also, last time I buy anything from Ubisoft before its on sale, this game has been out less than 2 months and it's already 25% off, with all DLC being 40%. Its akin to a slap in the face to those who pre-ordered or bought it when it was released. I rarely pre-order or buy during opening month, forever Transistor gave me a hungering for RPGs that could not be satiated so that's why I picked this up.","June 13, 2014","false","35.5"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","25","38","0","0"

If done right, the enemy won't ever be able to execute his turn. Of course, same applies to your party as well.\nAnother interesting mechanic is the firefly (your mouse pointer). You can use it to slow down a single enemy or heal your a party member which depletes a seperate "light meter".\nAll this combined makes for an interesting combat system.\n\n+/- The game has 2 difficulty modes: Casual (super easy mode) and Expert. Expert isn't very challenging, especially for veterans of the genre, but it does keep you on your toes as ♥♥♥♥-ups are less forgiving. This can be a good or bad thing, as the game is not intended to be an intense strategic challenge but rather a "light" game where you can sit back and enjoy the story and visual aesthetics.\n+/- Decent amount of side-quests (8-10?).\n+/- Decent length of around 20 hours playtime (my first playthrough was 24 hours and second playthrough was 15 hours = 39 hours in total).\n+/- Uplay. As much as I dislike having Uplay on my computer, it doesn't really bother you as all it does is have a second (automatic) login screen when starting the game. It has an offline mode option now as well so you can play without internet. If you do decide to keep it online though, Uplay will reward you with some Uplay points for every achievement which you can trade in for bonus items such as stat boosting "stardusts". Do note, however, that Uplay doesn't keep track of your achievements. If an achievement is "Meet X" and you've met X in offline mode, turning it back to online won't fetch you the achievement. The only way to get the achievement is to start over and meet X again.\n\n- Linear game\n- Not much replay value. New Game+ resets the story and you get to keep your character progression, your items and your "confessions". All it does is buff the stats of all monsters and EXP as well as better drops after battle. It still doesn't pose a challenge however. Then again, I might've been a little overleveled because I've equiped all my characters with Diamonds (+% EXP) throughout the whole game and haven't skipped any battles.\n- DLC Oculi Packs are a waste of money. Don't bother.\n\nFor what it is, it's a very good game. Beautiful art. Easy to get into.\n9/10\n\nPS. All the treasure locations for those who don't like to backtrack:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/70352935/CoL/index.html","April 18, 2015","true","38.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

After my saunter through the main story and a few side quests (8-9 hours), I was ready to be done. I left a few side quests unfinished. After you beat the game you are given the option to keep playing and finish what you started, but I was ready to be done. Also, the first time I tried to play it didn't really take with me. Not sure if the beginning is very boring or if I was in the wrong mood.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the game, it's a sidescrolling RPG with a turn based combat system similar to maybe an old Final Fantasy game. The entire game is presented as a children's story, and everyone rhymes everything they say. This leads to a few funny moments but can get pretty old. The story is a children's story cliche, but it's done well enough.\n\nThere is a good value for the asking price (even not on sale, 15 bucks isn't bad!). It's really nice to see a AAA studio take a chance and do something that isn't another iteration of their tried and true franchises and make a game like this. So although not perfect, I'm glad this game exists, and I recommend you play it if the subject matter interests you.","October 15, 2014","true","10.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

This game tells the story of a little princess who wakes up in a strange fantasy world that she must save. It's really refreshing to see a Princess saving herself and not the other way around! The world the artwork and the storytelling are BEAUTIFUL. Every line in the game is literally a verse of poetry. It's not always perfect but it's still awfully cute. Aurora is adorable and there are plenty of awesome characters you'll meet along the way.\n\nThe combat is a pretty basic. It's Turned based like Final Fantasy with a couple twists. It's not very hard and if you have ever played a video game before I reccomend Expert difficulty otherwise the game might end up boring you. The fights get more challenging as the game progresses but aside from boss fights I never really had a problem.\n\nOh and did I mention the music? The music in this game is incredible. When i first bought the game I listened to the title screen for a while before actually playing <3 Here's a link to the OST if you end up enjoying it as much as me. http://musique.coeurdepirate.com/album/child-of-light\n\nOverall I think this is a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/recommended/256290/","NeoRizer","NeoRizer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeoRizer/","368 products in account","Introduction\nAlright so Child of Light, interesting game, I won't go in to overly pretentious detail about what you can expect from this game in terms of artistic style because let's face it, it's all subjective, if you like what you see, then you're already interested. I'm not here to tempt you in to appreciating it's art style, I'm just here to give you the facts of what you can expect.\n\nHowever I will warn you that all the dialog is spoken in riddles and poems that rhyme... just let that sink in. It's not like you really have to pay attention to the story any way, it's fairly cliche drivel that you've seen before... If you've seen any Disney princess movie then you already know what to expect.\n\nHow does it play? / Overall Impressions\nWell it starts off as you'd expect from watching trailers and such, a 2D platformer with RPG elements, leveling up, skill trees and a huge party roster, half of which won't get much, if any, exposure due to novelty or situational skill set they have.\n\nThe problem with this game is the pacing... You think it's going to be kind of clunky and slow to start but shortly after the first boss encounter (about an hour in) you gain the ability to fly. Once you have this ability, that's it, you can pretty much traverse all the terrain in the game, there is no place out of reach. I foud this rather odd and it was a tad overwhelming. There is no limit on the amount of time you can fly either, like you literally just jump in the air, press the jump button again and that's it, flight mode...\n\nAnother point of note is that there are locked doors in the first couple areas, these doors can never be opened so don't bother wasting your time. There's nothing behind them and you never get a key or a side quest for them... just locked buildings for the sake of it...\n\nThis gave me the impression that this game was rushed, and upon further inspection, I think it kind of was, the end of the game just seems to kind of hit you really hard and fast and I never really felt like there was a "long way to go"... I finished it in just under 12 hours, two sittings, fairly short game, but again, it's 15 dollars. Honestly I'm not sure why this game is getting 9's and 10's... To be fair and honest, it's more like a 7 but I've found some pretty heinous glitches in it which lowered it's score for me to around a 6.5 / 10... It definitely needed more polish.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's a bad game or a game not worth playing, but there are just some things I can't overlook when it comes to video games... I'm a bit of a stickler for poor design and glitches that ruin my over all experience... Enthrall me with a story as much as you want, it's still a video game in the end, not a movie... So when things are bugging out, I can't overlook it.\n\nObnoxious Bugs / Glitches To Look Out For\nAs you may or may not know, this game has a BUTT LOAD of collectible items in it, and the game conveniently keeps track of all of this stuff, you have 16 letters to collect, over 400 treasure chests and around 50 upgrade items. Here's where the fun stops...\n\nSo I'm fairly O.C.D. when it comes to getting 100% in games, especially one as simple as this, so I felt up to the challenge, unfortunately there were a few isntances where I wanted to smash something.\n\nIf you initiate the battle sequence (touch an enemy) while opening a chest or collecting an item the game will glitch. Upon exiting the battle the chest will be open / the item will be gone from the map, the problem is you won't have collected it. Instead you have to re-open the open chest or re-collect the item again even though it is no longer visible. BE CAREFUL!\n\nIn the final area of the game there are 97 chests to collect but Ubisoft forgot how to count and placed 98 chests in this area and one of them doesn't count towards your final total... I'm not sure if not collecting it will count against you, I just found it to be a nightmare while following a collection guide... I knew I had opened 24 chests in the first area but the game said I had 23... just another warning.\nIs The DLC Worth It?\nNo. Do not throw extra money at this game, it isn't worth a cent. There's an extra character you can buy for 3 dollars named Golem, he's not worth it. He's the strongest physical fighter in the game and the best tank but he's so slow all he's good for is being a damage sponge... Basically his utility is crap. The best party in the game is Aurora and Finn, main DPS / Buffer and a Magic Nuker... that's all you need to win.\n\nThe other DLC items include giving you various combinations of stat upgrades and gems to combine so you can enhance your characters powers, you'll learn about that as you play... Don't buy them. If you're desperate for gems, just hack the value's in cheat engine, problem solved. Don't throw extra money at Ubisoft for junk.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIt's a decent little RPG title if you're craving some good old school turn based action, the party is unfortunately small though, two characters max... Reminds me of FInal Fantasy Mystic Quest, really basic... but still fun. My biggest issue is that some of the characters wind up under utilized or not used at all, for a game that bolsters a cast of over 8 characters, it's a bit ridiculous. Again the game felt really rushed like it could of been twice as long or had twice as much effort / thought put in to it but they seemed to just toss this thing out there.\n\nPeople claiming this is a 9 / 10 game are seriously wearing blinders, it's no where near a perfect game, in fact it's quite flawed. I am recommending it though because you will enjoy some of the RPG elements it has to offer, even though it's easily exploited. It doesn't take much to complete it, a couple 6 hours sessions and you'll have it done in a weekend so it isn't a huge time sink. I wouldn't pay 15 dollars for it though, try to get it on sale from Humble Bundle or GMG for 10 bucks at most.\n\nFinal Score\n6.5 / 10\n\n+ Looks good\n+ Gameplay is solid (Good balance of exploration, puzzles and battling)\n+ Fun battle system, albeit simple\n+ Lots of characters to choose from\n+ Interesting design\n\n- Felt Rushed (Locked doors you can never open, ability to fly given too soon)\n- Not a good time to price ratio (too short)\n- Bugs and glitches still not fixed (O.C.D. Nightmare)\n- Story is cliche, nothing new here.\n- Wasted Potential (Big character roster, two character party max)\n- Uplay....*puke* (I already have a main game client, I don't need yours Ubisoft)\n\nGet it on sale.","May 17","true","11.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

I probably wont put any more time into the game to wrap up those loose ends unless I'm bored on day, especially since all that is tied to Uplay, which provides almost no motivation to try and wrap up challenges other than to feed the completionist in me, which is almost non-existent anyway.\nOverall, I think I would give it 8 out of 10 for gameplay, but probably 6 out of 10 for story, and 10 out of 10 for artwork.\n\nRecommend, but not at $15 price tag.","May 7, 2014","true","11.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","5"

But the story in itself wasn't something really well written, was a bit.. cliche, the sidequest on the other hand were more immaginate than the main one. The members of the party were too similar and not really important, I mean there is some I never used aside for potion using. Also there is 1 member of the part who left and there is no way of getting it again, so all the equipement, lvl up and upgrades are lost. For a "Pseudo" open world since you can travel back as much as you want, there is never a real reason for that, aside from extra items and maybe achievements, but for story of lvl grinding is totally useless. As a final thing, Uplay, there is no reason for it to be using Uplay aside of use Disk Storage and sell you DLC. That is another thing, the DLCs are all totally useless, some give you items you get in-game with no trouble, some are skins (ok fine) and only 1 give you something relatively new, a party member, not even more story.\n\nI'm glad I brought this game when on sale, because is totally not worth the full price, heck no even 2/3 of that price.","June 27, 2015","false","6.6"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

My 7-year old daughter is a stuffed toy-throwing expert. She *really* fell in love with the lead heroine, Aurora, and each dramatic encounter would leave her aghast as the story unfolded. In this case a plushie bear attack was warranted as Child of Light got real right there. Funshine Bear might have lost a bit of stuffing too. The game was my choice for our daddy-daughter gaming nights and we enjoyed it so much, it warranted two playthroughs.\n\nUpon first firing up the game, what immediately hits you will be the gorgeous artwork and orchestral music.  It grabs you by the arm and just fills your senses with a massive serotonin hit. Backgrounds are exquisitely crafted with several motifs ranging from grey-blue ghostly forests to lava-filled mountain passageways in the belly of a giant colossus.  Scene by scene, level by level, you will experience lush hand-drawn imagery and meticulously crafted character art design. Each level has it's own art tone, much like a watercolor painting that conveys emotion and depth.  Also, the characters you encounter have an amazing originality and natural warmth in their faces.  You'll easily be able to recall them even months after you complete the game.  Honestly, Child of Light has some of the most beautiful art direction I have ever seen.  At no point in the game does this attention to detail falter. It is consistently gorgeous with an air of childhood fantasy accentuated by it's unforgettable theme song.\n\nThen there is the story and dialogue, done entirely in iambic pentameter.  Which to some may be annoying, but I personally found it to be an amazing surprise.  My 7-year old followed it a bit more easily than some other games and the rhyming conveyed that fairytale vibe you'd expect.  I will say that after awhile, you do encounter some odd dialogue that either barely makes sense or doesn't seem to rhyme as well as other passages.  While it's not a major issue, sometimes I didn't quite follow what was being explained.  Doing an entire game in iambic pentameter is no easy task, so having a few odd bits here and there didn't really affect my enjoyment.\n\nThe story follows a little princess from a kingdom in Austria that either died or mysteriously ended up in a mystical land called Lemuria.  I couldn't really follow how in the world she got to Lemuria, but almost all the story takes place there except for a few cut scenes of her father.  You explore and fight, gaining skills and friends who join your party along the way.  Each character is from a chapter in the story such as wizard villagers, giant mice with superb financial skills, an acrobat circus girl and her whiney missing brother, a giant soldier dude who seriously needs a manicure, and a young fish girl who probably has the coolest attack of all by knocking her opponents backwards to gain an attack advantage.  Boss battles tend to be tentacled monstrosities or evil villains turned into aquatic-looking baddies with minions.  You attack the tentacles or minions, but it's best to get the head as much as possible and don't bother to use any potions or life saves until the last few bosses because you will seriously need them then and only then.\n\nGameplay consists of a really interesting blend of crafting gems for skill points, a time limited RPG attack system, and a very nice method of switching party members to change up the strategy.  It works quite well.  The fighting occurs along a time line, giving you some unique methods of attack and defending.  The gems can be used to help against evil monsters by bolstering your character powers with skill against certain elements such as fire, earth, water, or lightning.  However, if you are familiar with turn based combat, I'd suggest playing on the hardest level.  Eventually, you'll fall in a groove of picking the right set of persons to attack and the right partner to heal them regularly.  I'm not particularly good at turn based combat, but I didn't die until the last few boss battles.  Even my 7 year old girl was able to handle the majority of fights after she saw the way I beat them, and pretty much only asked for help with the bosses when she played by herself on the second playthrough.  It's a little too easy on the normal setting.  You'll have to play with the character selection a bit to figure out which one has the best attack, but other than that it's fairly straightforward.\n\nIt's quite hard for me to critique this game, it has so many positives going for it.  Could it be a little less fairytale-ish? Um, yeah.  It could, but in doing so it loses some of that charm it's shooting for.  Was the combat boring? Not at all, occasionally tedious at worst.  With all the options given to you there is a lot to play around with in attacks and strategy.  Knock an enemy back in the timeline, defend until the right moment, switch out a character at the last moment, use the little firefly to slow down the enemy attack.  I could go on and on.  Do I really want to play a game about a little girl?  At first, not really.  Then as I played on I began to enjoy it quite a bit.  Child of Light has some of the best style, art, story, music, characters, and combat for such a small title.  I think the only weak link were some of the puzzles which were all on the easy side.  There were a few side quests to do, but I only did half of them.  It was preferable to enjoy the game story and combat rather look around for quests to complete.  This game shines brightly and is well worth the time to finish to the end. I highly recommend it","January 23","true","40.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/256290/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Child Of Light is a 2D turn-based RPG that has a gorgeous artstyle, in addition to a cute story that's told in nothing but rhymes.\n\nThe combat mechanics are similar to the ones in Grandia 2 (another excellent turn-based RPG, by the way). Your character's portrait will move from left to right on a bar at the bottom of the screen and when it reaches about 75% you can pick an action. When it reaches 100% they will execute this action. But, if an enemy hits you in this last timeframe you will be set back somewhere on the bar and your enemy will probably have the advantage by then. Of course, this also works the other way so it requires tactics to defeat your enemies. Enemies are also vulnerable to certain elements (fire, water, lightning, light, physical) so you have to switch between actions and characters in order to beat them. It's pretty deep.\n\nFortunately, you can usually select which enemies you want to engage, with the exception of bosses obviously. Battles can be a bit too long, and sometimes you have no other choice but to engage enemies because you really have to level up if you want to make those boss fights any easier. Exploring the world can be boring because except for a few sidequests there isn't much to do. Yes, you can open up chests or collect letters but they're usually 'hidden' in plain sight so the excitement of discovering things just isn't really there. Navigating through the world can also be a bit frustrating because it's not always clear where you have to go to, or what you have to do. Near the end I thought I was finishing up the story while in fact I had been completing a sidequest this entire time. But I guess that's a bit of the excitement part I was just talking about.\n\nThe rhymes also feel forced sometimes. Whenever a part of the story is told it all feels very natural, but whenever characters talk with each other it just feels awkward and forced. I think it would've been better if nothing but the story was told in rhymes. You know, sometimes less actually is more. That doesn't take away the fact that some are the rhymes are really nice and/or cool.\nThe game is long. Long enough actually. Any longer and it would've outstayed its welcome. I finished it in around 9-10 hours, but doing all of the sidequests and collecting everything there is to find will take you 3-5 hours extra if I would have to take a guess.\n\nI really enjoyed Child Of Light, especially halfway through but there's definitely room for improvement. Less rhyming, better navigation and exploration, and a bit more variety. If I had to rate it I'd give it a 7.5. In other words: a solid game.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","May 15, 2014","true","10.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombadilsboots/recommended/256290/","bombadilsboots","Bombadil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bombadilsboots/","63 products in account","I've played the entire game through twice now, and I feel comfortable in saying that, on the whole, I would recommend Child of Light to anyone who asked. But that doesn't mean it's without major flaws. As much as I enjoyed playing the game, the longer I did so, the more I became convinced of one thing: Child of Light is a decent game that could’ve been a GREAT game with better story and character development.\n\nBefore I further explain that thought, let me leave you with a list of things I really, really liked about Child of Light (in no particular order):\n\n1. Aurora. Despite my (soon-to-be-explained) issues with the character development, I enjoyed playing her because she’s a character with real agency. Over the course of the game, she makes a series of tough decisions using her own intuition and courage, and the narrative never treats her with condescension, or undermines her ability to make those choices.\n\n2. The combat system. This is one of my favorite parts of the game. It’s a classic RPG turn-based system with nifty little twists. Your party members and the enemies appear on a single timeline at the bottom of the screen; the speed at which each character reaches the end of the timeline determines who attacks when. The nifty part is that the player can slow down the enemies’ progress on the timeline—and even interrupt their attacks—thus adding an extra layer of strategy.\n\n3. The variety in party members. There are a lot of characters who join your party over the course of the game, and they each have different strengths. This gives you plenty of options in battle, and you can customize your combat style to suit particular enemies. As an added bonus, you can easily swap out party members in the middle of a battle and still have the newly-swapped-in party member attack on the same turn. I was really thrilled about that. More skilled gamers than I might find it too easy, but I enjoyed it. It actually gives you a chance to try out all these characters that you otherwise might never play.\n\n4. This is rather an obvious point, but the art. The visuals are simply stunning in this game. There’s so much visual depth to appreciate--I wondered if the art-style would make the background look flat and obviously one-dimensional, but it doesn't at all. The artists and developers also did a good job of integrating the moving characters into the painted scenery. They don’t look disparate or disjointed. It’s all very cohesive and lovely.\n\n5. Exploring the world. In large part because of the gorgeous art, it’s really fun to just fly around and look. I liked poking around all the areas of the game and soaking it in.\n\n6. (I'm sorry, I must all caps this because I WAS SO HAPPY ABOUT IT.) YOU CAN FLY FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT WITH NO STUPID, HALF-♥♥♥♥♥, IMPOSED LIMITS.\n\n7. The hints and undertones of myth. This is another element I wish had been better developed, but what information we do get about the world’s history and legend is intriquing to me. It creates a nice ambiance, even if it isn't as prominent or developed as I would've liked.\n\nSo, bearing in mind all the things this game does really well… I have to say, I was fairly disappointed in the storyline and the character development. Those are the two great weaknesses of Child of Light, and I think that's worth knowing before purchasing the game.\n\nThe story’s greatest shortcoming is its pacing. It starts off interesting enough—the main character, Aurora, appears to die in “the real world” and then wakes up in Lemuria, a fairytale world—and she spends the rest of the game trying to get back home. The pacing is fine in the beginning of the game (central conflict is established), and stays fine toward the middle of the game (central conflict gets more complicated) … but then the “middle” of the game suddenly becomes the end of the game; in what I honest-to-goodness thought was the middle of the story, the end-stage of the story came hurtling at me, and I found myself fighting the final boss, and everything was wrapped up in ten to fifteen minutes. As a player, I was left wondering what the hell just happened (wasn’t I just in the middle of a quest? Shouldn’t there have been more conflict before THE FINAL CONFLICT?). The ending is very, very rushed and therefore feels very, very forced.  I seriously thought I was still in the middle of the story when I came to what was obviously the final dungeon—that’s the kind of rushed I’m talking about.\n\nIf I had to break it down, I’d say 60% of the game is decently paced, but that last 40%—the part of the story that should feel EARNED, that should be a natural progression of what comes before it—is like a freaking whirlwind. There’s so much wasted potential in the narrative. And that’s the most disappointing part: if the writers/developers had invested more time in developing the middle-end and end of the story, it could’ve been so great. It had all the potential in the world, and then wham. Here’s your hat and coat, show’s over ladies and gentlemen.\n\nI think the poor character development goes hand-in-hand with the rushed story. If the narrative had been better-developed, I imagine the characters would’ve been better-developed too. As it is, they get left behind with the rest of the game's potential. The other major flaw with character development is that the writers told rather than showed. Most of what passed for development in the side characters—hints at personal back story and motives for joining the party—are all told rather baldly in dialogue, and that’s it. What you’re told is precisely and only what you get. There’s some cute dialogue between the various characters, but it’s all very surface-level and never leads anywhere significant. There’s no conflict or independent action or progression with them. This is the down side to an item on my pro list: because there are so many party members, none of them get the time and attention needed for real development.\n\nThe most developed character is Aurora, but her character arc has a lot of the aforementioned problems. I will say, though, that she has more urgency in her story—she has something very real to lose, and that creates organic conflict around her choices and actions. So I do applaud that part of her development—it just could’ve been SO much better with the right pacing.\n\nSo there you go. This game does a lot of things right, but because of its bad pacing, it really suffers in the story and character department. Ultimately, I enjoyed my experience playing the game, but if a haphazard ending will ruin the experience for you, it might be better to walk away.","May 24, 2014","true","39.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

There are many magical and physical attack skills to learn as you level up, giving you some customization and control over your party.  There is also a deep crafting where you build magic stones and charms to power up your equipment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/recommended/256290/","internisus","internisus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/internisus/","2421 products in account","The difficulty of reviewing role-playing games is that they so often seem more an assembly of parts than a sum, and, while Child of Light's parts do cohere nicely, it remains a challenge to describe as a whole rather than a collection of discrete elements.  Perhaps this reveals that its coherence is an illusion, or it could just be the nature of the genre.  It's a game that clearly has a soul, but that soul doesn't seem to come from a single auteur so much as a group of artists and designers working hard to ensure that their ideas coalesce.  At times, they strain themselves, but to their credit the seams rarely show.\n\nChild of Light is a Japanese-style role-playing game along the lines of Final Fantasy but agreeably streamlined.  You play from a side-on perspective, traveling through landscapes filled with roving enemies, environmental hazards, simple puzzles, and secret paths and alcoves.  Exploration is a pleasure because of the freedom afforded by the ability to fly in all directions, and each area feels fluidly laid out and is full of treasure to discover.  The protagonist, Aurora, is accompanied by a light elemental named Igniculus who can interact with objects and stun enemies, enabling Aurora to move past them without a fight or to get behind them for a surprise attack.\n\nBattles pit Aurora and one of her companions against an enemy set of up to three, and all participants move along a timeline displayed at the bottom of the screen.  This timeline is the core of Child of Light.  It is divided into two regions: a long wait period and a short cast period.  When a combatant reaches the threshold between them, s/he chooses an action to perform.  The cast time for any given action depends upon the character's speed and the specific action itself, and, if a character is successfully attacked during his/her cast period, the action is interrupted and s/he gets set back on the timeline.  The only exception is for defending, which has no cast time; thus, when choosing a character's action, the player must decide whether it can be completed before an enemy attacks or whether it is best to be safe and defend, effectively forfeiting the turn.  Finally, Igniculus provides the flexibility of control: the player can position him over a single foe at a time, slowing it down as it cowers from his light.  This allows you to make tactical decisions constantly, changing a turn-based game into something much more directly involved.\n\nMany of the best systems in videogames are very simple but allow for great depth, and Child of Light accomplishes this by providing lots of tools that can be used to manipulate the timeline.  The items that are hidden throughout the world are gems that confer attributes when equipped.  Some of these are standard RPG fare such as fire, water, and lightning offensive and defensive affinities, increased damage resistance or attack power, and bonuses to hit points and magic points, but the most useful—and interesting—gems affect the timeline.  Tourmaline grants attacks the possibility of paralyzing their targets, citrine yields a chance to set enemies back on the timeline, and spinel causes characters to begin every turn with a bump forward.  A crafting system allows the player to improve or transmute these gems as strategy requires.  The final piece of the puzzle is the characters' skills, which are quite varied.  In addition to the expected haste and slow effects, there are skills that set enemies back on the timeline, jump allies forward for a set number of turns, paralyze enemies for a given duration, and prevent interruption altogether during the cast phase.  Enemies provide their own interesting wrinkles, though; particularly later in the game, many will counter your interruptions with their own buffs, requiring you to alter your tactics and show restraint even when you have the opportunity to prevent them from acting.\n\nDominating a group of dangerous enemies by carefully controlling the timeline is quite satisfying.  However, Child of Light, being a role-playing game, cannot be won through skill alone.  If you play on Expert difficulty—and you should, as Casual is too easy to allow you to experience the depth that its systems have to offer—you need to make thoughtful use of the gems that you find and craft while exploring, your different characters' skills, and your real-time ability to selectively slow enemies; but you also need the numbers to back that all up.  If your characters don't progress at a sufficient rate during their adventure, no amount of tactical mastery will make up for their statistical shortcomings.\n\nThat's where the game's main design flaw comes into play.  To be fair, it's not entirely Child of Light's fault; this is a problem inherited from the long tradition of Japanese role-playing games.  While placing enemies within the game world for the player to avoid or engage at will happily eschews the standard exasperation of constant random battles, it represents a hypocrisy of intent since, while battles are made to appear optional, they really just aren't.  Taking advantage of this opportunity to avoid combat gradually puts players at an increasing disadvantage; those who are careful to circumvent what enemies they can will find their characters underpowered when they are forced to fight.  The ability to bypass battles sounds great on paper, but its implementation requires a more thoughtful approach for making it challenging to do so and for rewarding successful evasion with character progression to substitute for the experience that would have been gained through those battles.  For the player, the workaround is simple: make sure to fight enemies regularly throughout the game, even though you don't have to.  It's unfortunate and disingenuous for a game to indirectly force us to regulate our behavior like this, consciously preventing ourselves from taking advantage of an ostensibly viable gameplay option, but the problem does disappear in practice once one reconciles promise with reality.\n\nAs you're likely to have noticed already, Child of Light is remarkably composed of watercolor art in motion.  It's gorgeous from the start and straight through for the entire 20 or so hours it lasts.  The score by Cœur de pirate, the stage name of musician and composer Béatrice Martin, infuses the game with the most pervasive melancholy, albeit one occasionally relieved by notes of triumph.  This music might actually be the strongest aspect of the entire game: it thoroughly characterizes the experience and often seems more profound than the fairy tale narrative warrants.\n\nThe fundamental plot is clichéd, all evil stepmothers and light in the dark, but it is rescued in the telling due to the novelty of its rhymed verse.  Some may find it precious or cloying, but it charmed me.  While the writing can certainly come across as forced at times, it always arrives in bite-sized chunks, so no fault is ever severe.  There are plenty of dialogue exchanges that made me laugh or feel affection for the characters, and Child of Light plays with form by intentionally deviating from its rhyme in a couple of key moments.  Unfortunately, despite presenting a well-paced journey overall, the final moments of the game are rushed and sadly don't provide as satisfying a conclusion as they should.\n\nAlthough my opinion of Child of Light may sound measured in some respects, this is the result of taking a step back from the game to think about it critically; the truth is that I delighted in my time playing it.  Both established fans of RPGs and those curious enough to try a streamlined gateway into the genre should consider it highly recommended.","June 14, 2014","true","27.3"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","1"

The learning curve is low, characters easy to manage, and the entire game is controller-friendly. Combat is simplified by not having to choose weapons and armor, yet fun because the tactical element requires you to stay on your toes.\n\nThe mechanics of the game might be too easy for more experienced gamers, but there is a hard mode to make fights more challenging.\n\nThe story is an engaging fairy tale that is like playing through an interactive children's book. Aurora is a spunky and thoroughly likable main protagonist, wandering through the magical land of Lemuria trying to help its people and in the process trying to find her way back home (a palace in Austria) where her father, The Duke, has taken gravely ill.\n\nWhat follows is an adventure full of danger and camaraderie. Aurora is predominantly a spell-caster but can hold her own in physical combat with her sword. Other NPCs that join the party fill out the roles of magician, healer, archer, buffer, tank, and crowd control. Each character has a skill tree with three branches that can advance abilities via points granted with leveling up. It's impossible to max out anyone's tree in the first play-through, so the player can exercise some control over what they want their characters to do best. There is also a simple crafting system that isn't too grindy and allows the use of gemstones to augment skills and stats.\n\nThe art and music are gorgeous. The violence is underplayed in keeping with the children's story theme. The length is perfect for the tale being told and never seems to drag. My recommendation is don't rush through. Stop and enjoy the scenery, and explore everything because there's lots of hidden treasures to find that help with crafting and battle.\n\nAs an added treat, a second person can grab a controller and play as Igniculus (a talking ball of light) who assists Aurora's group in battle, solves light-based puzzles, and can reach items that are not accessible otherwise. In solo, he is controlled by the other thumbstick.\n\nThis game has no Steam achievements, which is a shame. But that's because it's UPlay.\n\nRating: 8/10\nFun for ALL ages! Might be a bit easy for hardcore RPG fans.","April 16","true","20.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It feels like an "Americanized JRPG" and I mean that as a full compliment. The art pulls you into the world, and the combat system is solid, and it's varying difficulties make it welcoming for new players and experts alike. The combat rarely seems like a 'grind' with level ups happening frequently and your characters showing almost constant growth. The level of detail, polish, and absolute love put into this game by its creators really shows.\n\nAlso, I think it's a steal at only $15 (the price at the time of this review). Any sale price below that makes this a 'must get'.\n\n---------\n\nA few notes: with the exception of "The Golem's Plight", the DLC is all bull, don't bother. Golem's Plight adds an extra character into the game (about an hour and a half into the game) who is useful, but certainly not necessary as the experience would still feel "complete" without it. For the other DLC, you get 'Oculi' as rewards in combat, kinda like money in most JRPGs. It's just a waste to buy it.

As other reviewers have said, the art is incredible. The combat, however, is a mix of frustrating and boring - not a good pair of attributes to blend in a game that's heavily focused on leveling up. Child of Light is a good thing to watch, but it just isn't very fun to play.\n\nUnlike many JRPGs, this game has gorgeous art and an actually interesting story. Each of your party members has a unique skill tree, as well as some unique dialog to carry you through the game. The story is told in bits of conversation, scraps of poetry, and the overall world design. In a way, it invokes the same sort of feeling as the much-vaunted Dark Souls: the game does not make you sit through pages of dialog, but the story is in the world if you want it. You don't need to pay attention to it if you don't want to, though, which is also nice. Most quests come as side quests, so you can comfortably ignore whatever you like.\n\nLevels are open and interesting, with enough nooks and crannies to keep exploration interesting. The game - on normal difficulty - loads you down with potions and other consumables, so even though you don't need the loot, it's still fun to get. You'll enjoy the light / dark theme that plays out in each level. Child of Light uses a few basic light mechanics (shadows, brightness, etc) over and over, but it still feels relatively fresh since the puzzles are kept very simple.\n\nUnfortunately, the combat is just unpleasant. In the beginning of the game, I enjoyed it, but by the end, I was desperately avoiding combat because it just took too long and was too frustrating.\n\nThe mechanics of combat have been described by many other reviewers, so I won't re-tread that ground. The interrupt mechanic is just poorly implemented, and whenever you get interrupted (which will happen a LOT), the game continues to yell at you that using the Defend option will "prevent interruption". It doesn't. Defend skips your turn in exchange for increasing your defense and giving yourself a speed boost towards the cast meter. Defend does not prevent skill interruption, and I spent the first couple of hours frustrated that the game was telling me otherwise.\n\nWith the gems (occuli) slotted, each of your fighters becomes specialized. So for each combat, you have a choice. You can either hit for low damage (i.e. using a Earth gem versus a Fire creature does no bonus damage) and immediately get countered for 3-6 times your damage. Or, you can swap out characters over and over. While you're doing this, you're continually getting interrupted and stunlocked. Defend, as I explained above, won't fix the issue since you ultimately will need to attack at some point.\n\nI really didn't enjoy the combat at all.","October 31, 2015","false","11.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/256290/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Child of Light is a turn-based roleplaying game with a very distinctive pseudo-storybook graphical style, written entirely in rhyme. Many of its mechanics are reminiscent of Final Fantasy X – including some painful dialogue.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game consists of two portions: environmental navigation and battle.\nEnvironmental navigation is actually a bit tiresome; at the start of the game, the player can only walk and jump, but very soon they gain the ability to fly around the 2D environment, eliminating all of the platforming elements in the game very early. This has a somewhat negative influence on gameplay speed, the player must explore an environment from top to bottom to find all the items and secrets, greatly increasing the amount of space which needs to be explored. In parts, it works decently well, but frequently it is tiresome, and only a few environments full of puzzles and traps are even remotely interesting to navigate.\nThere are no random encounters in the game; rather, monsters appear and wander around on the screen, and will attempt to pursue the player if they see them. The player will be “ambushed” if the monster runs into them while their back is turned, and will ambush the monster in turn if they manage to run into the monster’s back. This means that most of the time, the player will ambush the monsters, as not only is navigation simple, but the player controls a small ball of light which can be used to temporarily stun the monsters, in addition to healing the player between combats and activating some switches and puzzles\nThe game’s combat is actually reasonably sophisticated. The player controls two characters in combat, and faces off with up to three enemies at a time. It is somewhat reminiscent of Final Fantasy X in many respects; the player can switch out their characters at any time during combat, including replacing KOed characters with another character, and different attacks have different speeds. However, unlike Final Fantasy X, there are two different speeds which matter: the base speed of the character, and the speed at which the character acts.\nThere are two portions of a gauge at the bottom of the screen; the first portion represents the time spent between turns, while the second, smaller section represents the time spent charging up to attack or perform some other action. Each action has its own speed through the second portion of this, and if someone is attacked while they are charging an action, their action is interrupted and their turn is reset into some random (or semi-random) portion of the between-turns section of the gauge. As such, the player can interrupt enemy attacks, or the enemies can interrupt player attacks. There are some means of protecting yourself from such things, and some monsters will automatically counterattack against certain types of attacks (physical or magical) or against attacks made while they’re charging their actions.\nThe characters are actually quite varied, with each character having their own skill-set which is unlocked via a character-specific skill tree. Each character has their own set of abilities, and there are two characters who are primarily magic users, a warrior who can force enemies to attack him, a character who focuses entirely on speeding up or slowing down allies and enemies, a couple of physical attack characters, and some support characters. Gauge manipulation, interrupting enemy attacks, exploiting enemy elemental vulnerabilities, and applying the right status ailments while keeping your own party healthy are all important. The ball of light you control while navigating the levels also appears here, and can be used to slow down enemies or heal your allies – it is almost always better to slow enemies, though, as that prevents them from doing damage (and makes it easier to interrupt them) much more than healing yourself does.\nUnfortunately, after a while, the battles become a bit routine; while the first set of enemies in an area are new and fresh, after a while they become very routine and can be defeated via a very samey set of actions in the same way that Final Fantasy X fights often went. This makes many of the fights in the game fairly dull, and while they’re skippable, the bosses, which are much more difficult, basically require you to beat every other enemy in the game so that you’re the proper level to face them.\nThe boss encounters tend to be the highlight of the game; they’re the most enjoyable bits of it, and tend to be a bit different from other encounters, mostly in that the bosses and their companions tend to be more dangerous, quicker, and more prone to retaliation and inflicting annoying status ailments that require you to actually think on your feet. Even still, I got through the game without getting a single game over, and I suspect that most players will do so as well; indeed, I was left with an overabundance of items at the end of the game and used them with wild abandon against the final boss, as I had hardly used any prior to that point.\nThere is also an equipment system, in which craftable, equippable gems which are acquired over the course of the game are put into slots and have various static effects on a character and their statistics; these can be used to add elemental damage types to physical attacks, grant bonus damage, make a character tougher or more resilient, or even increase the rate of xp gain.\nWhile this system seems neat in theory, I had the xp-gain gems equipped to my characters’ body slots for the entire game, and never needed to remove them to mitigate damage. Moreover, I pretty much figured out exactly how I was supposed to equip all of my characters quite early and from there on out it was just a matter of marginally improving my equipment over time – not the most exciting thing in the world, but it gave some sense of progression.\n\n\nPresentation\n\nThe game is reasonably well-presented; the game tries to go for a sort of storybook style, with the characters appearing almost like paper cut-outs or things from a storybook, and the monsters having a similar stylized character. The music and sound are both reasonable enough, but a lot of the dialogue – delivered entirely in rhyme – is pretty awful. Sometimes it works well, but other times it falls down and is kind of painful to read.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nChild of Light is not a bad game, but it isn’t exactly thrilling either. Everything about it is a decent enough idea, but in practice, it only shines on rare occasion. The game takes on the order of 20 hours to complete, and has no replay value; while there is a new game + mode, there is little reason to play it.","December 6, 2014","false","22.9"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

If your character is hit by a foe while casting a spell or only using a potion, he is interupted and pushed backward. But you can hope that the other ally will be hit or defend yourself waiting for the right time. You can also always rely on your firefly friend.

From its method of storytelling to its stunning visuals and appropriately airy and pleasant orchestral soundtrack, everything about this game's presentation ties together like a fine piece of poetry. Sure, the writing is a little clumsy at times, and they reeeeally stretch the language to hit the nail on the head for some of those rhymes (see what I did there?), but the heart is there and that's why Child of Light shines as brightly as it does. It just has a ton of heart and love in it and its creators' care for the project shines through and is ultimately infectious.\n\nChild of Light's RPG elements are heavily inspired by Game Arts' Grandia series. Combat plays out with all characters assigned a spot on a timeline at the bottom of the screen. When a character or enemy hits a specific point on the timeline, they are then allowed to act. If a character or enemy is successfully attacked in the moments before their action is carried out, their attack is interrupted and they are pushed back on the timeline to hopefully try again. Combat mostly boils down to who can control the timeline better with their attacks or employing dirty tricks like slow down spells or status effects that inhitibt a character's movement on the timeline. All of the game's random battles have this strategic element, and boss fights even more so, which makes encounters not feel so mashy as RPGs can tend to be.\n\nCombat is enhanced further by the way you customize your characters. Level ups grant skill points that you can spend on skill trees to grow your characters toward the stats and moves you want the most, though there's never any need to maximize any one part of a skill tree if you want your characters to do a little bit of everything. The Oculi system helps customization further by allowing you to imbue your characters with elemental attacks, defenses, and abilities to alter their or their enemy's stats on the timeline. These aren't the deepest systems ever, but they add enough depth to keep the character progression important.\n\nSo yeah, Child of Light is pretty awesome. Its only flaws are that it can be a tad too easy (I HIGHLY recommend throwing the difficulty up to Expert as soon as you have the ability to) and a character or two don't quite get their chances to shine in the story before the game wraps up. Other than that, fans of JRPGs will be incredibly happy with what Child of Light has to offer with its engrossing story, beautiful world, and solid RPG mechanics.\n\n","June 28, 2015","true","14.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/recommended/256290/","waltonky","Puzzlebox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waltonky/","318 products in account","Final Impressions (01/11/2015; 15.5 hours playtime; Story Complete)\n\nIf and when some unfortunate woman bears my child, I will do everything within my power to have that kid play this game. What a delightful synthesis of fairy tales, story-telling, and JRPG mechanics. This truly is a great coming-of-age story that was unfortunately ignored due to Ubisoft's many misteps in 2014. But I have the excellent meltotheany to thank for bringing it to my attention as I originally stated.\n\nThe art direction in the game is fantastic. It really does look and feel like a children's fairy tale is playing out on screen. Moreover, the landscapes are varied and colorful, ranging from caves, forests, fires, castles, villages, etc.\n\nI found the rhyming dialogue charming. In addition, the dialogue really serves to bolster the characters' different personalities and backgrounds, whether they be brave warriors or merchants with a savvy eye on profit. Background characters aren't fleshed out as much in dialogue, often repeating the same two-line rhyming couplet. But this is forgiveable as they are background characters. A select few that give quests offers up for extensive dialogue that relates their personality so it's clear that it could've been done. But I will give Ubisoft the benefit of the doubt in that that didn't want to overencumber the game with too much irrelevant dialogue for the sake of word-building. There's just enough in there to give a generalized sense of the tribes and their cultues.\n\nAs far as battle mechanics go, this was pretty interesting to me. I've played a handful of JRPGs in my time and this echoes the turn-based model. However, it brings an interesting twist. The player can interrupt enemy attacks by timing their attacks to occur in a limited time window, and vice versa. This really put me on the defensive more than I otherwise would, often trying to decide whether I should gamble on getting an attack in before my characters are hit or whether I should buckle down and defend to mitigate damage. In addition, the use of Igniculus (a firefly companion that the player can control with the mouse) helps in the tide of battle by slowing enemies down, healing your character, or activating one of two or three troves of health and mana. Equipment management is largely tossed aside (which I think is actually a pretty good idea) with the exception of oculi. Oculi are gemstones you collect and craft throughout the game which can be placed in one of three slots for various combat perks. The crafting system is simple and easy to understand with the use of a small chart that is provided and the player is left to their own imagination as far as experimenting with different combinations.\n\nThe story of the game is also superb. On the one hand, it is somewhat traditional. On the other, being a sort of video fairy tale this is perfectly fine and there are a couple of twists to be enjoyed through the narrative. Ultimately, the game is a coming of age story as we watch Aurora deal with the new problems she has been presented with. Both the music and the narration butterfly perfectly with the narrative. This is especially true of the narrator, which chokes me up a little bit and brings me back to thoughts of listening to my mother tell me stories or read me books.\n\nFrom what I've read and experienced, many of the chracters are optional and are not required. The genius part is that this drastically affects gameplay, making the lone wolf much enjoy a much more difficult experience and a slightly stripped down story.\n\nAll in all, this is an excellent, charming game with a sweet soul. It seems to me that a lot of love and attention went into its development and it really reflects in the experience. I encourage anyone to purchase it and give it a go. And THEN, after you beat it, do a little research on things mentioned in the game as there is a grain of truth at the heart of the story.\n\nFirst Impressions (01/08/2015; 7 hours playtime)\n\nChild of Light answers the question of, "What would've happened if fairy tales and video games were invented at the same time and co-evolved?" The music is beautiful. The art direction is fantastic. As it stands right now, this game is a diamond in the rough that hasn't received the attention it probably deserves. Hell, I wouldn't even have known about it if it weren't for my friend Melanie.\n\nOnly two minor complaints so far. First, you have to use Uplay. That's not such a bad thing. My other complaint, however, broke my immersion for a brief moment. Early on, I was getting a few chuckles out of a particular character's dialogue. Shortly after an achievement popped up that said "Comedy." Normally I don't notice these if I'm not looking specifically for them on Steam. However, Uplay's design pops them in a big black box in the upper right and it's hard not to notice. I have hopefully turned these notifications off for the future but I recommend doing this before you begin your first play session.\n\nAnyway, more elaborate review forthcoming upon my completion of the game.","January 7, 2015","true","15.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

It's like you're literally inside a watercolor masterpiece world! I would put this on the same level as Okami for aesthetic value :) Yes, the rhyming does feel forced (because it is) especially during the dialogue, but that just adds to the quirky-ness of the Lemurian world.\n\nI found the battle system interesting. It took me a while to get used to because I'd never played a game with this timer-turn-based strategy system (though I'm sure it's not the first of its kind). But once I got the hang of how it worked, I was surprised, and elated, by how thoughtful your moves need to be, particularly in boss battles, to be successful and effective. However, you could certainly get through this game by simply throwing your most powerful moves at the monsters, you just won't be nearly as efficient. Some may consider that a downside to the game, but I think it is an upside: you can progress through and enjoy the story whether you want to play strategically or not, allowing more skill levels to be able to enjoy the game.\n\nThere is also a significant amount of exploring you can do to find bonuses, which I simply loved. This game exceeded my expectations in every way, and I would highly recommend it to anyone! As of this review (about 16 hours of gameplay), I have completed the main plot and all of the side quests (that I have found anyway), but I still have a bit more exploration to do to find the remaining hidden items in all the areas.\n\nI did experience a few glitches, such as Aurora's hair disappearing during battles and visual stutters near the end of the game, but nothing that effected gameplay.","December 20, 2014","true","16.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxPayneNG/recommended/256290/","MaxPayneNG","mèx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxPayneNG/","433 products in account","Child of Light is brilliant. The artistic value of this game is remarkable: the hand-painted backgrounds are stunningly beautiful, the orchestrated soundtrack is melodious and enchanting. Everything together makes you feel like you're really in a fairy tale. Exploring (or better, flying over) Lemuria is an absorbing experience, I think I'll never get tired of it.\nFortunately, under the huge artistic value there's a good game. The RPG mechanics are simple, yet engaging. There are no random encounters: you can see the enemies on the map and decide whether to engage them or not. The combat system feels like a good ol' jRPG, revolving around anticipating/interrupting the enemies and party members swapping. You can also use your little firefly Igniculus to slow down enemies and heal yourself, adding a layer of complexity to the combat mechanics. This system feels fresh through the entire length of the game, so you'll just find yourself willingly engaging all the enemies, since fighting them is fun.\n\nEven though everything seems swell and nice, Child of Light has some problems. Aurora is the only fleshed out and likeable character. The other characters are just... there, they don't make a difference. The whole game is written in rhyme, which seems cool, but it's not: the metric is all over the place, it's not consistent at all. In the end it didn't bother me, but it could bother you. The plot is simple, a standard (maybe a bit darker) fairy tale plot. I liked it anyway, it's a good justification to explore Lemuria and to flesh out Aurora's personality, but if you're seeking a complex plot you're looking at the wrong game.\n\nIn the end, is it worth 15 euro? Absolutely, it's worth more than that. We need more games like Child of Light, we need more middle ground between Indie and AAA titles. If you're on the fence, it's time to jump and buy this game. ;0","May 6, 2014","true","16.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

After some simple settings, the only interaction you need to have with it is closing the window when you quit the game.\n\nRegarding the game: It's a pseudo-real-time turn-based RPG set in a fairy tale world, wrapped up in a fairy tale story with fairy tale narration. Everything is in rhyme, and while the story really isn't too complex or gripping, it has a gentle nostalgic feel to it. The timing of the combat adds a fresh twist to the stale formula JRPGs have used forever, making each battle feel more real and alive.\n\nThe cast is diverse, yet the characters are flat- I didn't especially care for any of them, and there was one in particular that just got on my nerves. But the simplicity of their design fits in nicely with the simplicity of the story, and they each have their own little story which helps flesh out the world a little more.\n\nTo put it simply- This game is like playing through a bedtime story. For the most part, there isn't much depth, but the game doesn't lead you to believe otherwise. All it asks of you is that you listen, you enjoy, and you embrace this enchanted world. It's a great, simple experience.","June 29, 2015","true","22.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Better than I expected.  Simple but very enjoyable.\n- The art is amazing. Another "UbiArt Framework" engine win.\n- Your party has various different characters. They are funny to read and watch the interaction with each other after a battle.\n- The turn-based combat system has a very understandable layout. Another good thing is that after the first half of the game you keep discovering new tricks during the battles. Is simple but is has a few interesting interactions.\n- The score is very good. A bit repetitive during battles but one of those OST you would love to have on your iPod / mp3 player.\n- Puzzles are OK. There're a few repeated ideas but they are not boring and hard.\n- The Oculi crafting system is good. Maybe you'll need to play more after beating the game to achieve all the 600 combinations. I think I'll replay the game on handheld (PSVita). Again, is a beautiful looking game.\n- Is an accessible game even for non-RPG fans.\n\nCons:- A bit short compared to other games in the genre but I think it was a good experience. BTW the lenght depends on how much you go to little optional areas. The bad thing about exploring too much is that if you grind and level up your party faster than is expected you can feel the game a bit easy.\n- UPlay...of course...","November 11, 2015","true","10.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/recommended/256290/","artificialraven","ArtificialRaven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/","625 products in account","Child of Light is a 2d Metroidvania turn-based RPG in which a young Princess, named Aurora, wakes up in a mythical land known as Lemuria. In order to return home she needs to find the powers of the Sun and Moon but a sinister plot gets in her way. She finds creatures from all walks of life to help her in her journey, each with their own special power.\n\nThe artwork is really really good especially if you have an affinity for oil based and watercolor style paintings. The game worked perfectly with my Xbox360 controller and a 2nd player can control Igniculus the firefly with a mouse or 2nd controller too. The combat is a mildly complex paper-rock-scissors system (almost exactly like South Park: Stick of Truth) which has a timeline that shows which order the characters/monsters will attack (much like the Grandia games). It can be difficult to use in the beginning but by the end of the game nothing stood a chance against me even on expert. There is a skill tree that has 3 branching paths/playstyles for each character. There is also a crafting system for gems (Oculi) that you can equip on the character's weapon, armor or accessory to give it different effects and bonuses. There isn't much complexity in terms of platforming seeing as how you get the ability to fly early on and from there it's about not getting hurt by environmental hazards. It's a well made and beautiful game with a fitting classical-hybrid soundtrack. One thing that might be off-putting for people is the dialog, written in poetry form with rhyming. I got used to it though and found it less annoying the more I played.\n\nI played it for about 8 hours my first time through and got sidetracked with other stuff and stopped. I came back to it 2 years later and finished the game with ~16 hours logged in on my save file. Was it worth the $15 I paid for it? Yes. I'd say this is a pretty solid game well worth the asking price but even better if you can get it on sale.","March 21","true","35.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In addition it has the twist that you can hover over a single enemy and click to "slow" them with light.\n\nSome notes:\nPulls a lot of similar classic JRPG inspirations as my own game, Soul Saga.\nPlays and feels like a polished indie game, but was actually created by Ubisoft, a rather large AAA studio.\nAn interesting european take on the JRPG genre.\nBeautiful water color styled 2D graphics.\nThere are 2 difficulty modes: Easy and Hard.  I played on easy and, to be expected, it was quite easy.  I never tried hard.\nHealing is done in a unique way where you find glowing bushes that spawn a series of orbs you then move your cursor over in the correct order to spawn healing orbs.\nClassic European evil godmother and step sisters type fairytale story (with its own unique twists) that takes place in a surreal dream world.\nYou can fly early on in the game, making exploration quite fun.\nClever and interesting puzzles in the level design related to your light creating cursor and flying ability, though the puzzle variety is very limited.\nNo equipment, instead you combine gems you find to determine stats.\nA few quick side quests (12 total), but mostly just a linear main storyline.\nAll of the characters talk in rhyme.  Apparently they designed the game to be like an interactive fairy tale poem.\nSome weird uPlay login system, apparently a secondary DRM.\nNo Steam achievements as of this review posting.  Apparently the uPlay thing keeps its own achievement records.\nTook about 10 hours for me to do a nearly 100% playthrough. (missed one side quest)\nThere's some sort of new game plus, but I haven't looked into it as I felt satisfied with the amount I played\nA small critique, but it feels like the ending is a little rushed compared to the pacing of the rest of the game.  By just my intuition it seems like there might have been one last dungeon planned but got cut out for the scope.  Perhaps related: apparently the art director passed away a year before the project launched.  At the end of the credits his name, Thomas Rollus, appears as dedicated to.  As a game developer myself I was curious to know more about how an interruption with such a critical role affected the project, but couldn't find anymore information.

Now, the game is in 2D, portraying great art style of a land ruled by a Dark Queen and her forces which you as a Child of Light must fight to return peace to it's inhabitants. The story might sound very familiar but what must be taken into account is the way it is told. The pacing is precise and the dialogues are well written. The gameplay is simple and enjoyable, moving around and exploring different areas of the land of lemuria, collecting various items, turn-based fighting various enemies and a few bosses here and there, leveling up your character, crafting occuli (gems combined for various effects applicable to gear), solving a few simple puzzles and completing few side quests.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/assassinglasgow/recommended/256290/","assassinglasgow","AssassinGlasgow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/assassinglasgow/","344 products in account","This game carries its own little charm. Artistically, it calls back to the watercolour art of fairy tale books. Looking at it is incredibly nostalgic, since I used to read books like this as a child. Even the narrative is reminiscent of the best of fairy tale tropes, though the game manages to sneak in its own details and wit that keep the story feeling fresh and light. Even the characters are unique, with our heroine Aurora experiencing a coming of age story but still retaining a spunky attitude.\n\nThe best thing this game has to offer is the absolutely fantastic musical score that helps to create the atmosphere of Lemuria. The songs are emotional, they can be light, and they can be dark, all accentuating points throughout the game. And nothing is as good as the amazing boss battle music, with a male choir singing as you slice your way through hordes of monsters.\n\nThe turn based system was really interesting to see, and I really enjoyed how they implemented it into the game. The twist with the turn based mechanic is a sort of "wait" or "charge up" time, and it adds another layer of strategy in that you want to stagger your opponent and prevent them from doing the same to you.\n\nA slight downside is that, at least for me, I had a challenging time with bosses while playing casually (though it could just be the fact that I don't play many turn based games often and so suck). Also, while Aurora and several other characters are 3D models, her allies are not, which can be a little jarring but not enough to inconvenience the game. I do think they should have developed models that looked at least a little bit different or accurate to their drawn portraits.\n\nOverall, Child of Light is a lovely game, and something you should check out when you can.","August 4, 2014","true","12.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is an amazing combination of beautiful visual, music, gameplay, and fairytale style story. Playing this game is like playing an interactive fairytale story that's been told by our parents before our sleep. But instead stay in the bed just hearing them. We jumped in right into the world and feel the emotion in the first hand\n\nYou are Aurora, a little girld who's a daughter of a duke in austria at late 19th century. In one day you fall sick and died. But instead of go to afterlife you woke up in the world of Lemuria. You find out to go back to your father you need to help Lemuria regain it's sun, moon, and stars that been stolen by the Queen of Night. This is the quest of a pure hearted Child Of Light to help Lemuria and come back to her father.\n\nThe world of Lemuria is so beautiful, really well made and you can feel ubisoft were put their best effort to realizing this world. It's an eyecandy for me, at first I was caught in awesomeness with the artstyle in this game. And later on I found this world has many place to explore. Hidden crates, hidden places with some puzzle solving that aren't so hard nor too easy to solve really make every exploration is worthwhile in this game. The music? SO AWESOME. Coeur De Pirate has really done amazing job to living up the world of Lemuria. Her piano playing suites well with the atmosphere of the game. And the boss battle music can pump your adrenaline, make you talked to yourself, "Oh god oh god, this is must be the boss battle, this is gonna be awesome!!"\n\nIt's really amazing to see the development of Aurora. She's pure hearted, unadorned like how a little girl should be, really honest to other people and especially to herself. But at the same time she also very brave and don't hesitate to take a drastic measue (Read: Violent measure). At first she's so scared for being far away with her father in such strange and dark place. But later on with help from her friends, she began developing her own bravery. My favourite line in this game is when Aurora facing a giant that get in her way.\n\nAurora, "Step away, or I will turn you into clay."\n\nShe, and all the characters in game were not voiced, only a dialogue balloon like how the comic does. But because of that, I imagine my own version of her voice. I imagine a little girl voice but full with confidence, has no doubt nor fear. It made me chilled my spine because of the excitement.\n\nThe language that been used in this game is quite a mixed bag. They used somekind of language style that been used by old literature. At one side it can enhance the feel of a folklore, it feels like you just found an exciting old books, covered by dust in the box that been keeped by your grandfather. But in other side, sometimes it feels like it was forced. Like you want to told them, "Just speak normally."\n\nThe gameplay involve 2D platforming adventure when engaging the enemiesis turn based with action timed battle. Once you engaged by an enemy you will moved into a battlescreen like how the old JRPG has done. The battle is so engaging, the boss can be quite challenging in the hard difficulty but failure is not very punishing. Every party member has their own speciality. As example Aurora is the physical damage dealer and the only one who can inflict Light Element magic. There are only 2 party active member at one time. I said active because basically every member can be involved in a battle. And you can always switch the party member at any turn. Switching party member depend on the situation is critical. Fortunately you are not have to keep Aurora in the active party at all time. The main character can be putted on the bench so other party member can take her place.\n\nCharacter skills customization are quite typical. In each level up you gain one skill point to spend. The skill tree in each character has 3 branch and that 3 branches is the only option of skill customization. In the late game one character can max one to two main branches. The equpment customization is more unique than the skills. Each characters can use occuli to increase modify their attribute. There are many combination in this game that maybe can make you sit in the occuli system for hours just to make sure every party members has the most effective occuli combination.\n\nBut unfortunately, there are very annoying bug that ruin the beauty of this game. In this game, only Aurora and several other human character that been modelled by 3D. Other characters simply use 2D sprite. But when Aurora meets a characters that been modeled by 3D, the model overlap with each other. As example, in Aurora place, there were Norah, other character that modeled by 3D, stacked in her place. And in Norah's place, there was an Aurora stacked at her place. It always been like that and not a single time when Aurora meets other character with 3D model this bug didn't appear.\n\nMy verdict is 9 out of 10. It is a very beautiful interactive folklore that make you wonder why there are no books of it so we can tell the children about Aurora Story before they asleep? With full of moral lesson that not too being smart ♥♥♥ or too being rightful one. This game is amazing for every ages. Oh have I said this game is very cheap? Only $15 dollar for about 17++ hour of excitement is totally worth it.","May 6, 2014","true","24.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Beneath the cute, cherubic face of the main character, Aurora, lies a deep plot of betrayal, death, despair, witty dialogue, and complex emotional situations.  While the characters speak largely in prose, sometimes the rhyming seems a bit forced or tedious, but overall, this doesn't detract from the appeal of this game.  You may need a dictionary or thesaurus handy for some lines, as Ubi is definitely flexing their literary muscles with this title.\n\nUbiArt has found the perfect fusion between picturesque platforming adventure games and true, turn-based classic rpgs.  Using a battle system somewhat reminiscent of the battle systems in Final Fantasy 6 through 10 and a skill system something like out of 10 and 11, the player is given an experience that will probably be familiar, but with new aspects to it, such as the ability to choose an enemy to slow down.  The combat system is further diversified with the use of special crystals that the characters can equip in order to enhance various combat abilities.\n\nI just spent two days marathoning this game on hard and feeling very satisfied with what I had played.  While somewhat short in terms of rpgs at roughly 20 hours without DLC, there's no shortage of things to do in the game.  The tendency to skip battles will be high with the ability to simply fly around many of them, but you may not want to.  Boss battles tend to be pretty hard and need a good bit of planning to get through.  I'm honestly not sure if that holds true on lower difficulties.  One nice feature of the game is that if you've missed a side quest or mini-quest along the way, that's not a problem.\n\nI think the two best features of this game are the local co-op and the use of the light-based puzzles.  The second player takes control of Igniculus, a small light elemental that helps Aurora at the start of her adventure.  Using either the mouse or the second player controller (controllers work best in this game, imo), the second player can move around, gather items for the player, light up rooms, and slow down enemies.   This is a great feature for gamers with kids that actually want to take part in their parent's activities.  Even if they don't listen to you and go off and do their own thing, it won't be devastatingly bad, except maybe during a boss battle.\n\nThe light puzzles caught me offguard at first, but once I got used to them, they were fairly easy, yet still interesting.  More games integrating puzzles into their gameplay could definitely learn from the examples in this game.  I nearly got thrown off by one puzzle at the Gate to the Palace of the Sun, but was able to figure it out with some careful observation.\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is amazingly well done.  Songs are sufficiently long enough that being stuck on a stage doesn't become an experience of wanting to pull your ears off of your head, and the boss music is sufficiently epic for fighting demons, dragons, and things of that sort.  Perhaps even more fittingly epic than many other games that I've played.","May 11, 2014","true","26.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Amazing animations and a really well thought out game, WITH ONE PROBLEM!\n\nCons: SAVE FAILED!\n\nThis is a known issue that is apparently due to UPlay (another overlay launcher like Steam).  Numerous people have complained and while there are several fixes, none of them have worked for me.  This game uses an autosave feature and you CANNOT save the game yourself.  With this broken, it would be like playing a Final Fantasy game and starting over every time you quit the game.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  Ubisoft has made no attempts to fix this problem either, leaving lots of people (myself included) extremely frustrated.\n\nUPDATE: Ubisoft tech support was finally able to fix thsi for me by having me download a different ubosft installer.  Still, I'm not changing this rating, as this is something they should fix across the board with a pushed update.","October 31, 2015","false","43.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

If that's a sticking point for you then don't read any more, because the rest of the review is quite positive.\n\n2nd, its kinda in the realm of a visual novel, but without any of the drag along standards that keep visual novels geared towards older teens. If you want a story driven game that you could relax while letting your kid brother play at your grandma's house, here you have one.\n\n3rd, this is a short and easy game. Not that this is bad, just different. None of that "Hours into a dungeon and still no save point." The whole game took me just over 12 hours on casual setting. There is something to be said for an easy dungeon that is just long enough to chew that last piece of rhyming dialogue, before the next one.\n\nGraphics are top notch, though it is getting rare to see a new game that graphics aren't awesome in. Still worth mentioning, because its not about detailed realistic graphics that a hudred people coded together in a secret room any more. Instead what makes graphics shine is grabbing onto an artistic vision and being true to it throughout the game, which Child of Light definitely does gorgeously.\n\nThe music is okay, at least what there is of it. It felt a couple of times like they ran out of funding for their orchestra only 30% through the recordings. Some silence here and there, and a couple of somewhat obvious loops.\n\nPersonally, I very much enjoyed this game. I really hope to encounter not a sequel, but a series of games based on this style.\n\nHere are the subjective numbers:\n\n10/10 graphics\n4/10 music and sound\n9/10 story\n0/10 first person shooter experience\n8/10 game experience\n10/10 storybook experience","December 1, 2014","true","22.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The difference between this game and other turn-based RPGs is that each character's move is set on a timeline, with the player having the ability to slow the speed of each enemy's move, creating a more tactical approach to fighting than just waiting for your next turn to occur. The story is really well set out as well, with a great cast of characters and conversations in the style of poems.

There is an unmistakable somber quality throughout Child of Light, something I wouldn't have expected from a game with a whimsical watercolor art style. This game excels at bringing together elements from various genres and fusing them together into a shining example of innovation for the industry.\n\nLet me list a few of the highlights of the game before I get into a few critiques. This is a gorgeous game, like a living painting with fantastic use of color, interesting inhabitants and exquisite backgrounds. The music stood out from the start and meshed perfectly with the overall tone. The combat showed its depth when I got my greatest enjoyment out of it during my second time through (New Game+ on Hard). A simple but satisfying crafting system allows for customization without too much complexity. Dialogue written in poetry combined with a chapter structure and occasional video cutscenes all add to the moving storybook feel of the game.\n\nUnfortunately this game is not perfect. Some of my complaints, particularly the first one, are matters of personal taste so you'll have to decide for yourself whether what I'm describing sounds like something that would bother you or not. I'm not much of a fan of poetry. At times I did enjoy the rhyming dialogue but other times it seemed like the writers were doing verbal backflips to fit the rhyme in, which made it feel forced and/or obscured the meaning. I do appreciate the novelty of it and how it lends itself to the storybookesque design. Some may dismiss the game as a kid's game due to the childish visuals or playing as a young girl but I urge you not to make that mistake.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I will simply say that the ending felt like it came rather abruptly but was otherwise satisfying. There was a point roughly 2/3rds of the way through my first playthrough that the combat became boring for a time. I was afraid going into my 2nd playthrough (New Game+) that I would be bored with the combat during most of it but that turned out not to be true. The level of challenge on Hard kept me on my toes and making use of all my party member's specialties. I must say that potions are fairly useless in the game. I only used about a dozen in total. Also, don't expect any complex puzzles or platforming. You can fly from nearly the start of the game so traditional platforming goes out the window in favor of mostly manipulating things with your firefly sidekick. Controlling both Aurora with WASD and Igniculus (firefly) with the mouse keeps things interesting.\n\nIf I haven't mentioned any aspect you're wondering about go ahead and assume it's good, this game simply oozes quality.","December 15, 2014","true","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a beautiful example of how art direction can add so much to solid gameplay and a classic, if well-worn, story.  The game's combat system is really easy for any veteran of the genre (which is why they included a Hard mode), but works well and integrates well into the tactics you can do with your party.  It's solid, it's fun, and it strikes that balance where battles don't frustrate you into hating whenever they crop up, but they also interest you enough to put thought into the fight.\n\nIt's really the art direction that sells this game, though.  Everything is a dreamy watercolor and ink, perfectly suited for a children's story book.  Coupled with the excellent music, I found myself completely involved in Aurora's adventure, wanting her to succeed and happy that I was there helping her out in a way.  I cringed at her bare feet on the rocky ground, chuckled at every time she had to sternly correct people that she wasn't a princess, smiled at her childish and loving dialogue, fought not to cry at her moment of despair, and sometimes even found myself staring in awe as she took on grim creatures for the sake of Lemuria and her friends.\n\nIt's a fairy tale, so don't expect any plot twists, but it makes no bones about what it is, and as such people who come in expecting to be sucker-punched should probably stick with the games that do that kind of plot, like OFF or The Witch's House.  This isn't to say that the game lacks emotional torque; I've found it very difficult to get past teary-eyed even at the most intense moments in games I've played, and this thing had me fighting not to cry around the midway point.  I knew every last thing that would happen, and yet the telling was beautiful enough to make it seem fresh and new.  That's the core of it, really; it could have easily fallen apart with how cliched everything could be said to be, but it believes so deeply in its story that I ended up believing too, and that experience is what makes the difference.","October 15, 2014","true","19.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Was it the beautiful watercolor art?  The plaintive music?  The little girl that reminded me of my own daughter?  All I can say is that the previews exhibited an intangible quality that made the game one that I had to purchase.\n\nFirst and foremost, Child of Light is a classic fairy tale, told simply and in a straightforward manner.  It is filled with the tropes one might expect - wicked stepmother, lost child, an impossible quest - and is also possessed of the melancholy that the best fairy tales have, a feeling intensified by the haunting flute melody.  This effect is also heightened by the beautiful art direction.  I felt like I was watching a painted book illustration come to life, and when I first started the game, I spent a minute or two just marvelling at the way Aurora's hair swirled as if underwater.\n\nChild of Light is also a role-playing game, and although some of its mechanics fall short, the main battle system is wonderfully and unexpectedly engaging.  The basic concept is simple: during combat a single time bar shows who is the next to act, whether it be a member of your party or a monster.  Chosen actions and haste attributes affect how long it takes to reach the end of the bar and perform your action.  And if you hit a monster (or vice versa) in the small space of time right before it acts, you interrupt the creature and send it flying back down the time bar.\n\nThis one modification to a pretty standard combat system adds a layer of excitement and calculation.  Chain-interrupting a monster over and over again feels utterly dominating; trying to ensure that your party avoids interruption can be nerve-wrackingly tense.  And when you encounter later monsters and bosses that punish you for interrupting them, the sudden scramble to figure out an appropriate strategy is enjoyably frenetic.\n\nThe supporting game systems - skill trees, potions, gem crafting - are less polished, almost like afterthoughts.  Rather than enhancing the play, they feel like something tacked on just to give the player additional things to do.  That leads to another potential criticism: Child of Light is not the most difficult game, and someone yearning for challenging depth may be disappointed.\n\nAdd my feeling that the ending was a bit abrupt, and the conclusion is that Child of Light could have done with a few more coats of polish.  That being said, I still loved my time playing the game, the sensation of falling from the present into a magical and wondrous world.  For me, Child of Light is an easy game to recommend.\n\n--- Closing Eyes is Magic ---\n\n"Ready?" he asks, and Melly nods.  He pinches a blue plastic brick between two fingers and lifts it up before his daughter.  "And now," he says, "I will make this disappear!"  Melly nods again, solemn as a statue.  She doesn't smile much, not anymore, but he is hopeful that this will do the trick.\n\nHe holds the brick for a heartbeat longer.  Then he takes his other hand and swirls it.  "Abracadabra," he says.  "Hocus pocus. . .  Now close your eyes!"\n\nMelly does so immediately.  A faint tink falls somewhere in the room.  "Look," he says.  "It's gone!"\n\nIt is gone.  Melly jumps up and down and claps her hands; pleased, he spreads his arms in triumph.  "Again!" she says.  "Daddy, do it again, please!"\n\nHe knows he shouldn't, but he no longer has the heart to refuse her much.  And so he does it again: he holds another brick out, he waves his hand, he incants the magic words.  Except this time when he shouts for her to close her eyes, she keeps them open.  Her gaze tracks the brick as he tosses it over his shoulder.\n\nHe sighs.  "Potato," he says, invoking his pet name for her, "you didn't close your eyes."\n\n"I wanted to see what you did."  Melly says.  Her forehead creases, and for a moment he sees the ghost of her mother there.  "You just threw it!  That's not magic."\n\nHe rolls his eyes, exaggerating for effect.  "Well  of course not.  That's not where the magic is."  He takes his index finger and places it on her forehead, firmly.  "Closing eyes is magic."\n\nMelly hesitates, then agrees.  And when he performs the trick a third time, she closes her eyes.  When she opens them, the brick is gone, he is grinning, and she laughs and laughs and laughs.\n\n***\n\nThe next afternoon as they walk home from kindergarten, Melly trips over cracks, stumbles over rocks, bumps into mailboxes.  After the third time she falls, he examines her and frowns.  "Potato," he says, "are you walking with your eyes closed?"\n\nMelly smiles.  One hand grips her father's; the other is outstretched, palm up with fingers lightly curled, as if holding an invisible hand, or perhaps one that has been missing for the past half year.  "Closing eyes is magic," she says, gently.  "I remembered."\n\nStartled, he opens his mouth.  He should say something, but he does not know what.  So instead he watches his daughter float along, a dream on her face.  A few steps later, he closes his own eyes.  And then he opens them again to cross the street.","May 7, 2014","true","12.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After meeting a unique firefly named Igniculus, she learns that Lemuria's celestial bodies, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, have been stolen by the Dark Queen. While she is more concerned with re-uniting with her father, she is tasked with recovering the Sun, Moon, and Stars to save Lumeria before she does. Along the way, she will come across various opponents, and allies to assist her on the journey and in battle.\n=GAMEPLAY=\nChild of Light is primarily focused on the JRPG genre, with the battle sequence elements inspired by Final Fantasy and Grandia. You will have to wait until it is your turn to cast on the battle timeline to attack and ultimately defeat your opponents. However, if you get struck while on the "Cast" portion, you will be interrupted and will have to wait until you can cast once more. Each character has physical and magic attacks, although of course, some will specialize with one over the other. Aside from that, we have the open world type gameplay. Traveling to different towns and destinations are pretty straightforward, but no one said you can't explore. Each town you visit will have some sort of issue you must tackle before you can advance; it reminds me of Dust: An Elysian Tail pretty recently, but that game will be for another day. Towns will also have side quests if you are into doing it. Some of them do reward you with additional allies in the game, which is beneficial for the harder boss fights ahead. Something that I was really interested in but got bored of towards the end was the rhyming that they made in the game. It does sound like a nice concept to use when characters are talking to one another, but it seemed a little bit forced at times.\n=VISUALS/ART=\nVisually speaking, it is really awesome to look at when you're so into the game. According to the reveal at GDC Europe 2013 by Patrick Plourde, it is said that the art style is inspired by the films of Studio Ghibli and Yoshitaka Amano (known for his commissioned illustrations for Final Fantasy). The art is really pretty to look at, especially the way Aurora looks at one point in the game...my goodness...she's beautiful...I wish I knew how to elaborate on this subject more, but I'll leave that to those who can actually draw, unlike me.\n=MUSIC=\nMusically speaking, I find it interesting and really nice to listen to. However, my only complaint is the amount of repetition for the music pieces involved in regular fights and boss fights equally.\n=FINAL VERDICT=\nGiving the chance of bringing more publicity to the JRPG genre, packed with a beautiful looking art style, a great story, and nice soundtrack, with the expense of tryhard-ish rhymes, "Child of Light" is worth getting if you're big on other games like Final Fantasy\nOn a scale of Meatloaf to Pizza, I give this game: A "Spaghetti and Meatballs" rating.\n","May 27, 2014","true","12.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ctate/recommended/256290/","ctate","ctate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ctate/","116 products in account","I'm deeply ambivalent about Child of Light.  Its target demographic seems to be tween girls, which doesn't quite describe me, but I did find it engaging enough to spend the 18-ish hours of a complete play-through with all the side quests -- well, nearly all; about which more later.  Despite that, though, I finished with the sense that it's simply not that good overall.  I'm glad I only paid $15 for it.\n\nOn the one hand, much of the game is frankly gorgeous.  The watercolor world,, layered and constantly in motion behind the primary action, is brilliantly done.  So is the character animation while roaming that world: Aurora's hair billowing around her is nearly a character in its own right, and adorable.  There's a great deal to be said for a game that is purely wonderful just to look at.\n\nOn the other hand... it's not a particularly good game.  The most that can be said for it is that the difficulty ramp is tuned fairly well, with the significant foes in the final stages of the game being approximately as challenging as the corresponding ones in the early stages.  Beyond that, well... there's a great deal of repetition, of "oh, these are just like those only they're ice now instead of fire" cookie-cutter critters, and not much actual variety throughout.  The combat mechanic looks highly varied on paper, but in practice I found myself using essentially identical tactics against every foe, and all those options were pointless.  The thin veneer of "puzzles" in world-navigation in the end amounted only to "find the heavy thing nearby and drag it onto the pressure plate," repeated several times.\n\nAnd oh my stars, the writing.  The writing is bad.  Quite bad, really; and bad in multiple ways.\n\nA lot's been said about the game's couching all of its text in rhyme, and yes; it's all true.  The writing is clunky, forced, sophomoric -- so bad that I wonder whether it's a translation from another language.  The game is from Ubisoft Montreal, after all; perhaps it was written in French and then translated?  If so, I hope the French is considerably better.  In English, it's not only bad but illiterate.  The game consistently writes "fair" when the right word is "fare," for example.  That's one that a competent editor would have spotted a mile away.\n\nBeyond the quality of the poetry (or lack thereof) there's the story.  The story, too, is bad.  It's thin.  Insipid.  Narratively it's incredibly weak -- nothing you actually do has any relevance to the story; the mechanics of the game turn out to be unrelated time-filler in between cutscenes that actually tell the story.  The cutscenes themselves, all strung together, add up to very little storytelling time, and that's proof right there that there's just not much story here to be told in the first place.\n\nThere are other fundamental design and production flaws as well.  The mechanical powerup system is left coyly to the player's "experimentation" -- a ridiculous conceit given the availability of Google.  One of the significant side-quests was also, as far as I could tell, buggy and therefore unavailable in my play-through.  I consulted a number of walkthroughs, and they would say things like "go to this location and then pass through the village to the right until you reach the girl with the ! over her head.  Talk to her and she will tell you about the side quest" ... but there was no such character in that location or village.  Oops.\n\nI said above that the game is gorgeous, and it is -- the bulk of the time.  The world-traversal artwork, where you spend the bulk of the game (and in more static fashion where combat takes place) is terrific.  The animation of the Aurora model is similarly delightful, as I mentioned above.  Other characters' animation is disappointingly weak by comparison, though; combat winds up looking more cartoony and less engaging as a result.  Worst of all are the conversation interludes: they're ugly.  The detailed, multilayered watercolor world is set aside and instead we get zoomed-in three-quarter profiles of the characters, rendered in a rough, almost crayon style.  It's hugely jarring, especially since the poor artwork is invariably accompanied by worse (rhymed) dialog.\n\n... and yet, on balance, I'm recommending the game!  A lot of that is because it is inexpensive -- if it were a $40 first-tier title, I would absolutely tell you to save your money.  But $15 for twelve to twenty hours of entertainment is not that bad, especially if you compare it to things like movie theater rates (2 hours for $10!).  And it was entertaining -- despite gritting my teeth every time I had to get through a conversation scene's appalling rhyme and sub-par artwork, I was hooked, wanting to see the game through to the end.  I don't think I can honestly recommend against a game that I cared that much about despite significant flaws.","May 31, 2014","true","19.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its difficulty can be a bit underwhelming at times, but battles place a heavy reliance on planning, buffs, timing, interrupting enemy attacks whilst preventing your own from being disrupted and your usual RPG elements.  Namely, elemental weaknesses or some enemies being heavily resistant to physical attacks, but crumble under magic.  Or those that stage counterattacks to physical attacks, etc.  That part feels very Final Fantasy.\n\nUnfortunately, the depth and sense of achievement that would come from this Active Time Battle inspired element disappears when the game's relatively low difficulty comes into effect.  You are never in such danger, even by the midgame, that a health potion or a debuff spell doesn't completely turn the tides in your favor.  To that end, I do feel the game was intended for a younger audience.\n\nNitpicking aside, it holds very true to being a digital fairytale - if a somewhat dry one.  The story is not particularly engaging, so most of what will carry you along is the combat system and the overall charm the world itself presents.  There are mountains walking about with cities on their backs, visible in some area backgrounds far in the distance and that you scale from the ground up that gives some good flavor to the world overall.  But the slow pace of the story makes the beautiful watercolor backdrops something you'd probably be more satisfied taking in bites rather than trying to playing the whole game through in one sitting.\n\nOverall, it's a decent attempt.  It could do with a few more engaging or deep elements, but it is what it is - an indie-game-lookalike with a decent combat system and some charming decor.","June 13, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It just has a little problem with details.\n\n\nPOSITIVES -\n\nAnd honestly if that's what you want in a game, Child of Light is completely for you. Its gameplay is very simple, a little repetitive and not complicated, like the usual RPG. It'll throw in stat boosts, debuffs and a rock paper scissors formula as the game goes on, but nothing that's too difficult or new. So if you're fine with that old school feel, you'll be impressed with the game.\n\nThe art is painted, water colored and ... well, amazing. The music ranges from soft and to intense; the developer really knew what she was doing. The atmosphere is also done so well, from the dark and moody beginning, to the huge and open bright fields after you've gained your new powers.\n\nAnd really the feel of this game is what helps the story. You play as a young girl named Aurora who's been thrown down the rabbit hole, everything straight out of an old child book. And it really works. This coming-of-age tale is detailed and imaginative, but still very simple. It's a tale of good vs. evil, growing up and even tragedy. Running through a lonely and dark forest in the beginning of the game, only to shout a cheer when you gain your wings and sword, it just feels triumphant. Our main protagonist goes from being a slightly selfish princess and child, to someone who takes on responsibility, even if it means making tough decisions and charging into a dark world that isn't so different from our own.\n\nNEGATIVES -\n\nThe few problems of Child of Light are mainly its tedious puzzles, lack of development in its side cast and rushed ending.\n\nI had no problem with the old feel of gameplay or skill set, like some people do. But after hours of playing the game, even in its last dungeon, you'll be maneuvering around the same spikes, pushing boxes and following clues you've seen before. It would have been nice to have a little more variety.\n\nThe side characters are extremely endearing filled with personality, even if a little cliché. But after their initial introduction, they barely get any extra personal touch and their problems don't get mentioned or resolved until the end of the game...\n\n...which is rushed. And that's unfortunate, because it's VERY rushed. The game has a way of giving a good poetic feel when it comes to its plot. And certain things in this sort of fantasy setting aren't meant to make complete sense, but Child of Light still has it all structured. So it's pretty jarring when the game ends rather quickly, really quickly. It resolves everything, but it seems much more forced than everything you've been through so far. And certain plot twists and events don't get explained fully or at all at the end.\n\nCONCLUSION -\n\nChild of Light is really an amazing game and one of my favorites for 2014. It has everything put together so well and it’s just lovely.

I tend to stick with larger Tripple A titles from larger companies, and may sometimes jump into smaller, 2D, indie or story based games, but this game just blew me away.\n\nThe mixture of a great story with a fantastic soundtrack, and beautiful art design (so good). I remember exploring this world and seeing the amazing mountains and buildings in the background, and once even noticed a giant walking in the distance. The beauty of the game really blew me away, and the beautiful soundtrack made it better. It was so beautiful and fun exploring this world, and it left me wanting more when I finished. The combat was intense, interesting and really fun as well. I was really satisfied everytime I won a battle. The boss battles were really the highlight of the combat in my opinion. I had more fun fighting the bosses than the actual creatures you come across while exploring, and this is obviously how it should be.\nThe only negative thing I came across was that the menu was so obviouly made for consoles. It was awkward navigating at times and I often made mistakes, but it's something that I got used to and didn't mind too much, it's only a slight issue.\n\nOverall it's a great game that you should buy. 9/10 for those who care about scores...","June 23, 2014","true","14.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's a unique and engaging system where success depends on selecting the right characters for the encounter, utilizing the skills in an intelligent way, and a unique system of timing the attacks. Beautiful visuals are accompanied by exellent music. Music I'd actually listen to outside of the game.\n\nI almost quit playing after tiring of forced rhymes, and a story I wasn't that invested in. Around the middle of the game, I started enjoying the story a bit more. There were times when the story touched an emotional chord.\n\nCombat could become a little repetitive, but a new challenge usually wasn't too far around the corner so I persevered during those times. The music in the final battle was like a reward for my persistence. Controlling the flow of combat with Igniculus was rewarding in its own right, just as much as selecting the right characters for a particular encounter and making smart skill choices.\n\nA new game+ mode exists for those looking for more, but I think it is a 1 playthrough type of game. A playthrough which I enjoyed more than I first thought I would.

On the PC, first came South Park: The Stick of Truth and now Child of Light.\n\nThis game has a pretty unique art style which evokes a fairy tale in the player's mind. The entire game has a rhyme scheme going on with its dialogue which is interesting to say the least. The whole band of characters is likeable and man....the music.....the music will leave you spellbound.\n\nThe story is fairy tale material. I am 9 chapters into the game and it is pretty compelling. I am quite curious to see how it all ends.\n\nLastly the combat is surprisingly deep for a game worth 15 bucks. There are status elements to remember and exploit. There is a crafting system as well. The combat animations are well done and there is also a real time element to the turn based combat which makes the fights real tense.\n\nSteam says I have been playing this game for 20+ hours though that is a big lie as that figure is inflated as I forgot to exit uplay most times after quitting the game(I am sure I have played for 10+ hours). Coming to uplay, it's integration is painless and you won't even notice it's there. They seem to have finally got cloud saves enabled so I don't have to lose my save games again (thank god for that).\n\nAll in all, if you are pining for the JRPGs of yore, Child of Light will cure that itch.","May 11, 2014","true","26.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

We all know that. So what if you can stomach that crap?\n\nFirst: I really, really wanted to like this game. It is beautiful to look at and a joy to explore. Everything's hand painted.\n\nThat said, you are still left with an Extremely Hard turn-based strategy combat game. If you are exceedingly good at those Disciples games, then my recommendation is to buy this game. You will love it. If you are not exceedingly good at those Disciples games, you may hate this game.\n\nGuess which one I am? I just rage-uninstalled the game after my final, tedious boss fight. The highlight had to be finally humbling myself and moving down to the casual difficulty (inexplicably, there are only two difficulty levels). Even then, I was no closer to beating this particular boss.\n\nBetter yet, after failing out of combat this last time, I ran around and collected little wisps to replenish my health and magic, but who the hell cares: I went back into that super-hard fight minus all the potions I used in desperation the last time. I had one of those moments like "oh yeah, this happened last time."\n\nI found potions in these ornate boxes with so much fun little mini-fanfare - like collecting candy - only to blow them all in one bad fight.\n\nIf you need to farm, the game fails to convey it. You sure don't get much from the random combats out in the world. There is almost always a resource cost for any combat useful enough to gain XP from. As a result, I never had enough resources.\n\nAdd to that the very last thing that I'm sooo tired of in this genre: The constant action interruptions and revive-fall-revive-run-away stoopid-loop that seems to characterize the games in this genre.\n\nI keep wanting to like this genre. I keep being disappointed. And yes, fanboys: I suck. So what.

Think old style jrpg, but with a side scroller twist. Only a couple hours in, and it's already showing signs of being quite deep with a nice skill tree setup for character progression. Story seems a bit 'childish' (with a name like that, no surprise there) but it looks to be headed in deeper territory. Visually pleasing, with lots of variety to locales and cool effects. Very nice. Also expect plenty of chuckling as the dialogue is almost entirely done in rhymes.\nThumbs up.","August 6, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are typically riddled with secret areas you can sniff out for treasure, puzzles or hidden bosses. Often there'll be more than one path to your destination, making exploration more interesting.\n\nDuring your travels, you'll meet many fun characters who'll give your quests, join you in your adventure, or both. My favourite was a female jester who couldn't do the dialogues in a proper rhyming fashion, allowing the other characters to jump in and correct her. Her healing abilities were also very welcome in a fight, making her one of my most used characters during combat.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but has a real-time element that lets you delay enemies' turn or slightly heal your party out of turn. Timing this ability is important to winning encounters, as it lets you better use or avoid being the victim of the interrupt mechanic. Interrupting means hitting a character trying to perform an action, resulting in his turn being delayed. If you don't go for the easy difficulty, combat offers good and rewarding challenge that makes you invest time into considering how to specialise your characters.\n\nEach character has a network of specialisation trees, offering abilities unique to him while giving you a choice between the different paths. For example, there's a wizard who can specialise in lightning, water or fire, allowing him to excel against certain creature types vulnerable to his focused element. Another character can choose between improving his defense, his offense or his ability to direct enemy attacks against him.\n\nA problem that grows as the size of your party increases, is the frequency of level ups. Very quickly you'll be looking at one or multiple level ups after pretty much every battle as your characters gain levels and extra skill points to spend. It becomes tedious looking at the skill tree menu this often.\n\nAnother part of character customisation is the Oculi system. Oculi are gems you gather and can use kind of like equipment items such as swords and armor in other games. They offer different bonuses depending on color and slot used, and can be combined to form more powerful gems. Oculi juggling gets a little cumbersome, but is nonetheless an important strategic element as you want to equip the right damage and resistance types depending on the opposition of your current area.\n\nApart from having trouble with Steam starting the game through Uplay for some reason initially, the only bug I noticed in the actual game was that sometimes when entering combat, Aurora's (the main character) usually flowing hair wasn't drawn.\n\nIf you're not playing on Easy difficulty and like to explore and look for secrets, you should expect around 20 hours of gameplay from Child of Light.\n\n\nTIP: While Child of Light offers controller support, I really must recommend using mouse and keyboard. You will need the precision to properly manage the real-time element of the otherwise turn-based combat.\n\nTIP: If, like me, you have trouble starting the game through Steam, try launching Uplay directly and start the game from there. After doing that, it's been working for me no problem.","April 13, 2015","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But bear in mind I'm really disappointed. After having a great time with Valiant Hearts I thought it was a good idea to give a chance to another small Ubisoft game. But Child of Light is not like Valiant Hearts at all. First, the story is lame at best. It's not interesting for anyone above 7 years old and the way it's told makes it even worst. The game tells its story with rhymes, like a poem, which is cool at first, but boring after some minutes. It's because they just couldn't write the story using rhyming during for a 7 hours game. The failed attempts to rhyme every single dialogue make the story hard to follow and button to skip very attractive. The good is: the art style is gorgeous, perfect for some screenshots, making this game easily one of the prettiest games out there right now.

Its mechanics are solid, easy to pick up and play, and never seem to leave me bored like so many other RPGs. Its a little on the light-weight side, but its design is very intuitive and to the point, but still presenting a challenge. It has checks and balances against "min-maxing", but that's often done simply. The progression system is also simple compared to older RPGs and some modern one (though much more advanced than, say, games like Final Fantasy 13 or World of Warcraft).\n\nThe story is very nice and inspiring, very melancholy and darkly beautiful. Its like looking through the eyes of an innocent child at a destitute world; that's pretty much the theme throughout. Its more than the sum of its parts in the emotions which it evokes.\n\nIts a long-run RPG but ends abruptly, however it still manages to wrap things up nicely. As far as I can tell, there are no end-game quests, no "ultimate weapons" to be had, which I find somewhat disapointing. I know there's some things I haven't completed, but I'm not holding my breath for anything like, say Final Fantasy 8's endgame.\n\nAll in all its a great game, and one of the best of its generation of games (Xbox 360 era till now).","March 12, 2015","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Aurora, first born princess of the Austrian King, falls to illness and is transported to the fantastical land of Lemuria--a kingdom of monsters and anthropomorphic animals alike.  It is in both the adequately written prose and beautiful illustrations that one feels they are interacting in a proper storybook.  The gameplay also draws from a long-line of classic influences; side-scrolling areas are subtle in their similarities to Metroid-vania games, while the battle system is turn-based and real-time with a smattering of Grandia's system of delaying and interrupting actions with carefully timed attacks.\n\nThe combination of beautiful illustrations, a lullaby-like soundtrack, and a nostalgic battle system enticed me to return each day to learn a little more about Aurora's newfound whereabouts.  While dialogue between characters is again illustrated with beautiful character profiles, the conversations themselves can feel a little contrived at times--granted, I would snicker here and there.  Each part of Lemuria is broken up by chapters and again highlight the range of beauty that the game's artists are capable of showing us.  Animations are smooth and the use of lighting for backgrounds and objects really adds to the fantasy.\n\nIn the end, I found myself enjoying Child of Light for what it was trying to be; an interactive storybook that subtly entices you to turn each page carefully and deliberately in the hopes that you'll get lost in it.  At the same time, I was disappointed by that very thing--a mostly pretty game with a fun story that doesn't demand that you invest in their characters beyond some archetypical quirks.","November 7, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The visuals are beautiful and the story is entertaining and poetic. I thoroughly enjoyed all the different party members and the game's plot.\n\nLiterally, my only disappointment is I wish this game was longer, because I didn't want it to end so soon. Also, it requires Uplay, a client provided through Ubisoft. Based on other reviews, it appears to be finicky. But I didn't seem to experience any problems with it. Even after I had nearly stopped playing the game for a year and went back to play it again later, I incurred no serious issues with the Uplay service.\n\nIf you're into RPGs you should definitely give this game a try.

Infact i can imagine them just taking the straight rayman engine and loading it up with these cartoony/storybook assets.\n\nAnyway the game started out strong for me, an interesting story and art style and game mechanics but after a while those things get stale. Most puzzles involve using Igniculus to shine on some element or to project a shadow. I thought you might get other abilities other than flying but you don't. Then i also found myself skipping alot of the dialog which i rarely do in games, i think its just due to the fact its not straightforward chit chat.\n\nAll in all though it was fun enough to push through, the other characters and pickups and parts of the story were intersting enough and i could see some different experiences happening between players if you don't seek out every single thing in the game.\n\nI can see a sequel or another game of a similar style really tightening up some of these aspects and making a much better rounded experience.","June 7, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The added RPG elements make it a very interesting side scroller. The characters are ok, you can choose between their different skill trees, but in the end there are so many that you won't get to play with half of them.\nOverall it's a fun game and very enjoyable if you are into this kind of games.

Yes, the dialogues rhyme. Yes, it actually has a pleasantly optimized battle system.\n\nIt is also extremely EASY. I started the game on "Casual" and immediately switched to "Expert" because "Casual" played more like a peaceful demo than an RPG ("Casual", - the name says it all).\nI mean, I can see why this game would be geared towards people like me - those who enjoy having a strong story, nice visuals, and simpler, easier battle that can just serve the story instead of presenting an additional and parallel challenge.\nI know we're not in Dark Souls territory here, but I like earning my victories and the Expert mode is barely making me work for it. If it's too easy for me, it's probably too easy for 90% of players out there.\n\nThis would be a must-have game for youngsters (14-18 year olds) interested in getting into rogue-like RPGs. It's gentle enough, eases you into the battle and has an engrossing story.\n\nFor experienced players though, the game would get old fast and the characters seem very over-powered for a real challenge to eventually develop.\n\nNow, if the previous warning hasn't changed your mind, here are all the wonderful things that this game has to offer.\n\nSPOILER WARNINGS (perhaps)\n\nIn combat there is a time-dependent turn system that allows the player to skip ahead of enemies' turns if the right casts and potions are used. Each actor's time to next action can vary, sometimes spectacularly (you thought you were behind an enemy, but suddenly he is interrupted by your teammate and his TTNA is lengthened). This adds a level of interesting unpredictability to combat gameplay.\n\nAnother useful bit of info that nobody else has mentioned: during battle the firefly glims generated when Igniculus "shakes" the light bushes are worth about twice Igniculus' light meter. For optimal utilization of the glims, always try to capture about half of the glims, then let the rest float around until the light meter is running low again. Otherwise, once the meter is full, any additional glims are going to waste.\n\nUbisoft made the welcome change here of shifting cleric-type casts like healing and enemy debuffs outside of the turn system and onto the Igniculus character.\nThis enables a more offensive dynamic to develop with PCs and focuses on matching attacks to enemies, timing offense and defense (NB: when enemy and player character are within the timer's "red zone" the preferred action should be defense), and generally making your party more proactive and less micro-managed.\n\nI personally spend most of battle with the Igniculus trigger enabled on one of the enemies, according to each of their turns in the battle sequence and their action speed.\n\nParty members start out "pre-typed" so to speak - Aurora is clearly a mage-type build, despite the big MFKN sword she receives at the beginning. The skill tree however, offers an opportunity to shift the character type more towards a melee fighter with strength and HP boosts. If that is your intention, I would recommend to either grind a bit at the beginning to earn Uplay credits that you can redeem for HP and strength bonuses, or maybe to wait for the right party member to join gameplay and mould it into the fighter that you want to have up-front and in the face of your enemies.\n\nSadly there is no cover system, no grid and no distinction between melee and ranged fighting - a mage cast is equivalent to a physical attack, and each character has a primary physical attack. Honestly at my current level my characters are so OP that I can't tell if it makes a difference or not. The only noticeable thing is that my fighter character has MP that she never uses unless there's a major crisis like HP drastically low while Igniculus' meter is empty - in which case she can heal any party member (as a turn-based action). This permits for the fighter character to occasionally squeeze out a buff for the entire party at the beginning of a battle and just sit on the rest of the MP until needed at a later time.\n\nThe gem upgrade system was also nice (called "oculi" in-game) with a no-nonsense elemental interdependence (fire, water, lightning) that allows you to have ridiculously unfair advantages against enemies. A typical attack makes almost triple the damage if the correct oculus (can I decline it that way?) is applied to the weapon.\n\n\nOne thing that bothered me at the beginning was that when Aurora walked, the feet were misaligned with the path on which she was walking (it looked pretty half-♥♥♥♥♥ for all the effort that was put into creating the backgrounds in the first place), but after the first boss-battle where the additional ability of flight is unlocked, and implicitly moving speed increases, that is no longer an issue.\n\nThat being said, it's a nice game that's difficult to put down. If I had kids, I'd let them play this.\n\nWill update my review if my opinion changes before I beat the game.","December 25, 2014","false","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A typical attack makes almost triple the damage if the correct oculus (can I decline it that way?) is applied to the weapon.\n\n\nOne thing that bothered me at the beginning was that when Aurora walked, the feet were misaligned with the path on which she was walking (it looked pretty half-♥♥♥♥♥ for all the effort that was put into creating the backgrounds in the first place), but after the first boss-battle where the additional ability of flight is unlocked, and implicitly moving speed increases, that is no longer an issue.\n\nThat being said, it's a nice game that's difficult to put down. If I had kids, I'd let them play this.\n\nWill update my review if my opinion changes before I beat the game.","December 25, 2014","false","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If a character is attacked while preparing an action, they get knocked back on the timeline. The problem is that this is a feast or famine system; you're either obliterating the enemy or caught in an unwinnable situation.\nIn the second half of the game, there are enemy combinations who will caste haste on their entire team and slow on your team. Add to that, that there can be 3 enemies, but only 2 of you. This leads to battles where you're consistently getting knocked back or put into a situation where all you can do is block or try to heal (basically never being able to damage the enemies to give yourself a chance). Then, you try the fight again and get a bit luckier (or are better equiped) and win easily in 2-3 turns.\nIt really feels unbalanced, and I didn't enjoy it.","January 8, 2015","false","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The environment is beautiful and the first couple hours of gameplay have a great story and then it feels like the writers started to get lazy or maybe there was less budget available.  After a while the combat starts to get really repetitive with no new abilities to mix things up.  It really seems like there was very little thought into balancing the skills and party members available - what ends up happening is that there are 2 characters are the end of the game which (if leveled correctly) vastly overpower the others and make combat trivial.\n\nOverall this game has about a 8 - 10 hours of non-repetitive entertainment so I'd suggest holding off purchase until your hours to $$$s ratio is at least 1:1.","March 24, 2015","false","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes. Does it matter? No.\n\n\n- Art :  First of all right on the title screen i can see a lot of love and care went into this game. Theres a few details i'd like to point out like a giant moving in the background. and There is one point when when you here lightning you can see a afce appear for a few seconds little details like that are what make this game amazing. I hope whoever did the art in this game does many more games in the future.\n\n\n-Sound/music : The sound track is simply amazing i could listen to it for hours on end. My faorite is actually the victory theme to the game   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYr0a4yb_QI  I won't talk about just that thoug. When your explaoring the world you get really sucked in listening to the music and looking at the art that its just amazing. Words really can't describe how good it is.\n\n-Gamplay : Like any normal jrpg you have as some say a gradian styled turn based battle. each character takes a turn depending on how fast they are. However they made a litle twist to keep it fresh and new. During "casting time"  if you get attacked and or your enemy get's attacked  you can inturpt the turn flow. how is this usefull ?\n\nSome skills have a short , medium , long ,very long casting times.  depending on what the enemy uses you can avoid a really big attack. Also your firefly friend can slow an enemy down which is also really usefull at times.\n\nExploring the world is also like any rpg though i you played metroid you will find it to be more of  metroidvania game then anything which is a good thing who doesn't like metroidvania games?\n\n\n- Overall : To all you uplay haters your missing out on a great game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thoughtsponge/recommended/256290/","thoughtsponge","Thoughtsponge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thoughtsponge/","202 products in account","Child of Light is a fairytale roleplaying game in the vein of many fondly remembered children's stories.  Aurora, first born princess of the Austrian King, falls to illness and is transported to the fantastical land of Lemuria--a kingdom of monsters and anthropomorphic animals alike.  It is in both the adequately written prose and beautiful illustrations that one feels they are interacting in a proper storybook.  The gameplay also draws from a long-line of classic influences; side-scrolling areas are subtle in their similarities to Metroid-vania games, while the battle system is turn-based and real-time with a smattering of Grandia's system of delaying and interrupting actions with carefully timed attacks.\n\nThe combination of beautiful illustrations, a lullaby-like soundtrack, and a nostalgic battle system enticed me to return each day to learn a little more about Aurora's newfound whereabouts.  While dialogue between characters is again illustrated with beautiful character profiles, the conversations themselves can feel a little contrived at times--granted, I would snicker here and there.  Each part of Lemuria is broken up by chapters and again highlight the range of beauty that the game's artists are capable of showing us.  Animations are smooth and the use of lighting for backgrounds and objects really adds to the fantasy.\n\nIn the end, I found myself enjoying Child of Light for what it was trying to be; an interactive storybook that subtly entices you to turn each page carefully and deliberately in the hopes that you'll get lost in it.  At the same time, I was disappointed by that very thing--a mostly pretty game with a fun story that doesn't demand that you invest in their characters beyond some archetypical quirks.","November 7, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What I love most was the battle system which was a slightly more dynamic version of the turn-based Active Time Battle system used in many older Final Fantasy games. The visuals are beautiful and the story is entertaining and poetic. I thoroughly enjoyed all the different party members and the game's plot.\n\nLiterally, my only disappointment is I wish this game was longer, because I didn't want it to end so soon. Also, it requires Uplay, a client provided through Ubisoft. Based on other reviews, it appears to be finicky. But I didn't seem to experience any problems with it. Even after I had nearly stopped playing the game for a year and went back to play it again later, I incurred no serious issues with the Uplay service.\n\nIf you're into RPGs you should definitely give this game a try. And if you're not too familiar with the style of RPGs, don't worry. This game is straight forward, easy to get into and quite intuitive when it comes to controls.","May 22, 2015","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was rather skeptical when I got this game, not sure if I will enjoy a turn-based RPG as I normally play action/ FPS. But since this game had Overwhelmingly Positive reviews, and the fact that I could get it cheap, I decided to give it a try.\n\nI was pretty thorough with my play-through and clocked a total of 13.7 hours. And the thing is, I enjoyed every moment of it. I didn't complete it in one sitting (obviously) but I think it was three. I kept playing on and on and I think part of the reason was the battles. As mentioned, it is turn-based RPG with a focus on a timeline (some mentioned that the Final Fantasy series use this mechanic, but I'm new to it). There is no guarantee that you can even cast your spell, and sometimes you even lose the fight having done completely no action. There is some strategy involved and fights can be frustrating especially in Hard mode. It was new for me and I really liked it.\n\nApart from the battle system, there is also the crafting system worth mentioning. You collect these sorta gems from chests or from battle drops and you can combine them to form more refined versions or hybrid versions. For example, ruby + sapphire + emerald = diamond ; and 3 x ruby = bigger ruby. Equipping these gems in different slots give different stats that can help you in the battle.\n\nThe story is fine, nothing spectacular/ mind-blowing like in Bioshock Infinite, but it flows smoothly just like a Disney classic. The artwork is really well done too.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, and I look forward to upcoming games of this genre.\n\n10/10","April 29, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its art and soundtrack work harmoniously and smoothly, you can spend HOURS playing without getting tired. Unlike AAA titles, CoL has no explosions, blood, violence - that kind of action. At the same time, it finds a balance where there will be a game that you won't sleep because of the lack of action. Even more if you are familiar with turn-based RPGs.\n\nThe rhyming story is well constructed and developed by charismatic characters with unique characteristics. Some details about the game interface has bothered me (like not being able to organize my party) but it weren't enough to discourage me or took away my interest in knowing what would happen next in the story.\n\nI finished it in PS4, Vita and I also got a copy on Steam.

Family, Hope. Find all of these things in the game and disregard the real-life counterparts. Withdraw from all social events involving your friends and family. Procrastinate even more skilfully and deftly with this charming and deceptively strategic RPG. And, if you're a student like me, disappoint your parents even further by spending an embarrassingly large amount of time before the screen, watching little animals violently flog one another to death.\nBecause my goodness is this game glorious.\n\nThis game has it all : storyline engineered to make you cry, beautiful watercolour artwork, simple yet strategic gameplay, treasure hunting, side quests, crafting, levelling up (with the possibility of grinding if you're into that), hauntingly heartbreaking music and sexy rats in finery and merpeople (again if you're into that). The world and gameplay are utterly absorbing, such that 7pm quickly becomes 10pm and you give up on doing your essay and instead consign yourself to playing for another couple of hours because it's already late and you're kinda tired and what can you do.\n\nI'll speak on the strongest part of the game (and arguably the most important part) : gameplay.\nSo the game incorporates the Active Battle System (Active Time Battle ? Active Battle Time ?) seen in early Final Fantasy games - in other words, the player and the enemy each have a bar that charges up, and when it is full they may "cast", or complete an action, be it attacking, defending, taunting or buffing allies up with freakish dancing. An interesting component (or two) included in this game is the ability to interrupt an action by hitting the character in mid-"cast", causing the interrupted to have to refill their charge bar. Time it right and the enemy will never land a hit on you, whereupon the aforementioned flogging takes place. Alternatively, panic as you yourself are trapped in such a vicious cycle of flogging and swear under your breath because the enemy is too many and too fast, and you are too slow and weak and pitiful or both. You also have the ability to manually slow down the enemy (or heal yourself) by clicking and holding the mouse (although it's a firefly in the game) over the characters, allowing you to turn the tide of battle or at least give yourself a bit more breathing room if you're getting absolutely pummelled.\n\nThere is nothing more satisfying than defeating a boss that you have branded as being "cheap" and "too fast" in the first minute of battle, nothing more elating than having your frustrated despair abruptly change to malicious glee as you discover the proper strategy required to take them out, and there is absolutely nothing that trumps the feeling of having successfully carried out your petty vengeance by dealing an inordinately and unnecessarily large amount of damage to an enemy barely clinging on to life. Eat it !\n\nSo concludes the more positive part of the review.\nThe negative part is a lot smaller and miniscule in importance.\n\nEssentially, if rhymed poetry is not your friend, or if rhyming in general just gets on your nerves, watch out. The entire game is composed of rhymes, and some of them wholly repetitive. There's only so many words you can rhyme with "bye" or "me" (actually that's a lie, there's a huge amount that rhymes with those two words, but in the context of a video game, let alone a conversation in a video game ? I think not). You can also collect collectibles in the form of "confessions" (essentially background history) which is also completely composed of rhyme. And this time the language is a lot more sophisticated. So if you're lazy, a bad reader (which means you should've stopped reading this review a good 5 paragraphs back), a second language speaker (I joke) or simply rhymephobic, avoid at all costs. But because this game is a combat game and not a reading poetry game, I'd have to say that its impact on the game is fairly minimum.\n\nAnyway. Buy it. Play it. Love it. Finish it. Then don't touch it again until nostalgia brings it to the forefront of your mind.","March 27, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

Yes. Does it matter? No.\n\n\n- Art :  First of all right on the title screen i can see a lot of love and care went into this game. Theres a few details i'd like to point out like a giant moving in the background. and There is one point when when you here lightning you can see a afce appear for a few seconds little details like that are what make this game amazing. I hope whoever did the art in this game does many more games in the future.\n\n\n-Sound/music : The sound track is simply amazing i could listen to it for hours on end. My faorite is actually the victory theme to the game   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYr0a4yb_QI  I won't talk about just that thoug. When your explaoring the world you get really sucked in listening to the music and looking at the art that its just amazing. Words really can't describe how good it is.\n\n-Gamplay : Like any normal jrpg you have as some say a gradian styled turn based battle. each character takes a turn depending on how fast they are. However they made a litle twist to keep it fresh and new. During "casting time"  if you get attacked and or your enemy get's attacked  you can inturpt the turn flow. how is this usefull ?\n\nSome skills have a short , medium , long ,very long casting times.  depending on what the enemy uses you can avoid a really big attack. Also your firefly friend can slow an enemy down which is also really usefull at times.\n\nExploring the world is also like any rpg though i you played metroid you will find it to be more of  metroidvania game then anything which is a good thing who doesn't like metroidvania games?\n\n\n- Overall : To all you uplay haters your missing out on a great game. It deserves to be played by all. If your a fan of rpgs in general pick it up. You will not be disapointed.","May 7, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/256290/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","ContextChild of Light is what many call a AAA indie game. It's an hybrid between a JRPG and a (light) platformer, from Jeffrey Yohalem, best known for Far Cry 3.\n\nIt's quite the leap, from one game to another!\n\nThe team who made this game was far smaller, but more focused as a result. It comes from a place of fairy-tales and fantasy worlds, as form of escapism. It's definitely different from what we usually see in videogames, especially from big companies.\n\nIts art caught my eye a while ago, and since it was on sale, I decided to finally try it! Unfortunately, due to university, I couldn't play it all in a few days, having to play it sparingly, in the span of 2 weeks instead.\n\nIt took mee a little over 15hours to beat, with every sidequest done, on "Expert" difficulty.\n\n\nPresentationAs I said, its visuals were the first aspect of this game to catch my attention. It instantly reminded me of John Bauer's work (who is rather well known for his Swedish Folktale illustrations -- Paradox's Runemaster was mainly inspired by his art as well!), which was a nice surprise. Later on, as I played, I dug a bit deeper and discovered that it was indeed inspired by not only his artwork, but all of the Golden Age of Illustration, which I didn't know about. Look it up, it's great!\n\nThe whole game is hand-drawn and painted, with the addition of some 3D animation as well as lighting effects. Comparisons with pop-up books aren't unfounded either, as the game has lots of different layers of textures in the backgrounds, making the game feel very organic.\nThe art in general is rough, almost looking like a draft, but I feel that was intentional. All in all, the game looks great, and certainly unique (!), but I would have liked to see a more detailed version of this style.\n\nAgain, when I looked the Golden Age of Illustration up, I was amazed with the detailed drawings. Of course, it's very different to make 10-20 drawings than it is to make probably hundreds, for a complete videogame. Still, since it's Ubisoft we're talking about, maybe the idea will be pursued further!\n\nThe animation also has some really nice details to it! Not unlike Disney or Ghibli's movies, the best part of it is how they animate the little details and creatures that populate the universe.\nUnfortunately, the enemies weren't nearly as fluid and charismatic. Not sure if it was to reinforce the hand-made feeling of the game or not, but it would have been better to flesh those out a bit more.\nThe backgrounds, though, are full of live, with little creatures constantly popping up. Very nice art direction, overall!\n\n\n\nThe Music was mostly awesome! Honestly, it evoked similar feelings as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons did. It has calm moments, composed only with a cello and a piano or a flute, on top of the ambience sounds, and it's great! Besides, there are some musician characters around the world, who play their instruments in tune with the background music -- which I always love!\nEven the main character plays a flute, at times, making some of the melodies very memorable!\n\nThe biggest problem, for me, is how grand ideas always seem to fall into the same pit: orchestrating their music. Seriously, it happens way to many times.\nInstead of the very organic and personal music with just a couple of instruments, the game sometimes feels the need to orchestrate everything. While it gives it a more "epic" feel, it's much more impersonal and generic, to me.\nThis happens mostly in the battle tracks, but it was still rather underwhelming, to me.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Coeur de Pirate. I didn't know of her music, and still don't like it very much. Regardless, she has done a brilliant job in here!\n\nThe sound-effects didn't catch my attention. I'll take that as a positive, since I can be easily annoyed by them!\n\n\nGeneral Structure & MechanicsThe game has 2 main components: 2D platforming, where you explore the world and meet NPCs, and then the JRPG combat system.\n\nNeither of them are really noteworthy on their own, but everything in the games comes together rather well, creating a very solid overall experience.\n\nThe game only has an overworld map, with the ability to fast-travel to previously seen locations.\n\nThe adventure/exploration aspect of the game is mainly tied to exploring the landscape, finding Coffers with consumables, Attribute bonuses, and Confessions (which I'll explain later on).\nYou get the ability to fly very early on, so platforming, per-se, isn't an issue, here.\n\nThe maps are fairly open, with lots of (slightly) hidden areas for you to explore. However, the game's RPG side is very stream-lined, making most of the exploration pointless, most of the time. I still did explore, but the payout was very little, because of the combat.\n\nThe encounters aren't random, as you can see every enemy. You can also avoid them, if you will. I'm assuming this could be fine if you were playing on Casual Mode ("For those in it just for the story"), but on Expert, you will need to fight the monsters to level up and face the Boss fights. There's no need to grind, and fighting the monsters you encounter normally should suffice.\nThis is a good way of doing things, although Yahtzee has a good point: Is it worse when the game batters me with the boring stick, or when it puts the boring stick on the ground and leaves me to batter myself with it?\n\nWhy is the combat streamlined? Well, for example, there's no equipment. Instead, each character has 3 Occuli slots, which are crystals that you can craft, each with a different effect. The 3 slots loosely stand for Weapon, Armor and Trinket. The crystal's effect in every character is the same, when used in the same slot.\nIt's actually quite complicated to explain. And even more to discover their uses, since the interface for it is rather clunky. It was clearly made with a controller in mind, and is missing a lot of keyboard+mouse funcionalities.\n\nEach character has a "talent tree" with 3 branches, that give them access to different types of skills. You get skill points from leveling up. There's no re-specializing whatsoever, which can be annoying. If you get another character with the same skills you've already chosen in another character, it can be annoying to be stuck with a bunch of useless skills.\nOverall, though, it didn't prove to be a real issue.\n\nCombat dynamics are completely off\nFor example, you have access to several potions, with stat changing effects (for X turns, in combat). These do exactly the same as characters' skills. So... why use potions? There's almost no reason to! With the exception of H/MP potions.\nThen, there's the fact that there's a "progress" bar, influenced by speed. When you reach the "Casting" part of the bar, you're set back, and your spell canceled, if you're hit. This adds strategy to the game, but you're often outnumbered (you have 2 characters, vs. 3 enemies). This gets you interrupt all the time, during Bosses. And it simply feels unfair! It's infuriating, at times, as you almost rendered useless.\n...\nThen, there's also the fact that buffs don't last long at all, and with only 2 characters, you have to cumbersomely change between characters... it's effective, but very counter-intuitive, and makes the combat less enjoyable than it could have been.\n\n\nI'm already out of words. I didn't like the combat.\n\nHowever, I thoroughly enjoyed the overall experience! I think it dragged on a bit, especially with the sub-par combat. And for each of its faults, the game also had some nice little detail to make up for it!\n\nI enjoyed the world and the dialogue (which is all in rhyme -- didn't annoy me at all, I actually found it a nice little effort).\nIt's a very nicely crafted experience, give it a go!","April 2, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Sure, there's a horrible third-party DRM involved (Uplay), but that shouldn't stop you from buying this game. Anyone who skipped buying it for that reason, or for any reason at all, is missing out.\n\nBoasting exquisite art that amazes the eyes down to the finest detail, playing Child of Light is akin to walking through a picture book. From Aurora's intricate character model to the resplendent backdrops present throughout the world of Lemuria, the game never ceases to impress with its visual glory. Moreover, the ability to fly is granted to the player very early on, allowing you to explore Lemuria as you wish.\n\nBattle in Child of Light is largely similar to typical turn based systems in other games, though there are still some twists that make it unique and perhaps, slightly difficult. Good timing of moves in particular is extremely important to triumph over the various monsters that you will encounter during your journey.\n\nMultiplayer isn't a totally fleshed out feature of the game, but it's possible. During battle, a second player may assist you by controlling Aurora's companion, Igniculus, to slow or stun single targets. This allows you to focus on planning and executing your moves rather than having to bother with micromanagement simultaneously. It's perfectly possible to handle both tasks on your own if playing by yourself, however.\n\nChild of Light's soundtrack was composed by Cœur de pirate (Béatrice Martin), a tremendously talented singer/songwriter. I've personally purchased the soundtrack (which is available on her website) for the sole reason that it was a pleasure to listen to.\n\nNaturally, this game's winning asset is its impeccable story - one that's heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time, albeit easy to follow and understand. Saying any more would simply ruin the serenity of its plot, so I'll leave it to you to find out for yourself!","December 30, 2015","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's simple, but as the plot progresses you need to employ new strategies and be smarter to keep up with new enemy variants. Child of Light is addicting and entices exploration. It's not far into the game that you gain a new power to roam around with which makes the game much more enjoyable and opens up the 2D map extensively to reveal a much larger world than you realized. Playing alone is fun in itself, but one of my favorite features in Child of Light is the cooperative mechanic that allows for another person to join in to help explore and fight through use of the mouse. Cooperative play adds a whole new element of teamwork as your partner can use the mouse to heal the party or slow enemies while you plan the next move.\n\nThe story and presentation of Child of Light is charmingly reminiscent of a classic Disney movie. The journey of Princess Aurora as she finds her way through a magical woods to find a way to save her father, while not breaking ground in storytelling, has that classic fairytale vibe that harkens the mind to more innocent and simple times. As you journey through the woods you'll come across several companions to join your party. While the cast of characters is diverse and their interactions amusing, you'll find yourself using only a couple through the length of the game--bringing an additional one or two out to deal with certain enemy types. This didn't really bother me, but it's to be expected when you have this many characters in your party in such a short game.\n\nI suppose that's my only gripe with Child of Light--it felt short, but that may be because a friend and I beat it in the length of a day. I got it on sale and don't regret what I payed, but I can't help but feel thankful I didn't pay full price. Regardless, I had a blast exploring and fighting bosses with my friend. If you like RPG's with turn-based battle mechanics or a story that harkens back to the classic Disney Princess tales of yore, then you will enjoy Child of Light.","January 5","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Procrastinate even more skilfully and deftly with this charming and deceptively strategic RPG. And, if you're a student like me, disappoint your parents even further by spending an embarrassingly large amount of time before the screen, watching little animals violently flog one another to death.\nBecause my goodness is this game glorious.\n\nThis game has it all : storyline engineered to make you cry, beautiful watercolour artwork, simple yet strategic gameplay, treasure hunting, side quests, crafting, levelling up (with the possibility of grinding if you're into that), hauntingly heartbreaking music and sexy rats in finery and merpeople (again if you're into that). The world and gameplay are utterly absorbing, such that 7pm quickly becomes 10pm and you give up on doing your essay and instead consign yourself to playing for another couple of hours because it's already late and you're kinda tired and what can you do.\n\nI'll speak on the strongest part of the game (and arguably the most important part) : gameplay.\nSo the game incorporates the Active Battle System (Active Time Battle ? Active Battle Time ?) seen in early Final Fantasy games - in other words, the player and the enemy each have a bar that charges up, and when it is full they may "cast", or complete an action, be it attacking, defending, taunting or buffing allies up with freakish dancing. An interesting component (or two) included in this game is the ability to interrupt an action by hitting the character in mid-"cast", causing the interrupted to have to refill their charge bar. Time it right and the enemy will never land a hit on you, whereupon the aforementioned flogging takes place. Alternatively, panic as you yourself are trapped in such a vicious cycle of flogging and swear under your breath because the enemy is too many and too fast, and you are too slow and weak and pitiful or both. You also have the ability to manually slow down the enemy (or heal yourself) by clicking and holding the mouse (although it's a firefly in the game) over the characters, allowing you to turn the tide of battle or at least give yourself a bit more breathing room if you're getting absolutely pummelled.\n\nThere is nothing more satisfying than defeating a boss that you have branded as being "cheap" and "too fast" in the first minute of battle, nothing more elating than having your frustrated despair abruptly change to malicious glee as you discover the proper strategy required to take them out, and there is absolutely nothing that trumps the feeling of having successfully carried out your petty vengeance by dealing an inordinately and unnecessarily large amount of damage to an enemy barely clinging on to life. Eat it !\n\nSo concludes the more positive part of the review.\nThe negative part is a lot smaller and miniscule in importance.\n\nEssentially, if rhymed poetry is not your friend, or if rhyming in general just gets on your nerves, watch out. The entire game is composed of rhymes, and some of them wholly repetitive. There's only so many words you can rhyme with "bye" or "me" (actually that's a lie, there's a huge amount that rhymes with those two words, but in the context of a video game, let alone a conversation in a video game ? I think not). You can also collect collectibles in the form of "confessions" (essentially background history) which is also completely composed of rhyme. And this time the language is a lot more sophisticated. So if you're lazy, a bad reader (which means you should've stopped reading this review a good 5 paragraphs back), a second language speaker (I joke) or simply rhymephobic, avoid at all costs. But because this game is a combat game and not a reading poetry game, I'd have to say that its impact on the game is fairly minimum.\n\nAnyway. Buy it. Play it. Love it. Finish it. Then don't touch it again until nostalgia brings it to the forefront of your mind.","March 27, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

Child of Light is an RPG from Ubisoft Montreal. Let’s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nFirstly, the thing that struck me the most about this game is the art. The artwork is beautiful in every sense of the word. It has a distinctive, watercolor style and it works splendidly with the premise of the game. You’ll really feel like you’re playing through a storybook and it is a wonderful experience.\n\nThe story of the game is pretty good and it is filled with interesting characters (and enemies). The game world itself is a great canvas on which the story is able to unfold. It’s imaginative, original, and refreshing.\n\nThere’s a good variety of enemy types for you to take on during the course of the game. There’s more than enough to keep you interested in combat.\n\nThe combat system itself is very old school. It’s set on a timer, and you’ll need to time your character’s attacks if you don’t want to get interrupted and have to take a penalty on your timer.\n\nThe Bad\n\nAs far as RPGs go, I typically go in expecting to have at least a good handful of items to equip my character/party with. While CoL does have some items, it is quite lacking on the changeable weapons front.\n\nThe Meh\n\nEven if you get this one through Steam, you’ll be having to play it through Uplay.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nChild of Light is a solid RPG and a worthwhile addition to any collection (and that is just for the artwork alone). You can find it in the Steam Store and with the Halloween Sale (most likely) just around the corner, you should keep an eye out for this one. As always, thanks for reading.","September 27, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has been some time since I had last been emotionally touched by a game. But the princess is just so cute, especially when she is weighed down by her large sword after holding it up for a victory. Awww!! The dialogues are often cute and funny, I also didn't think the riming got tiresome, but maybe that's because I'm not a native speaker. The soundtrack is great and wonderfully adds to the atmosphere.\nThe story is a bit in between. It's very nicely presented with the dialogues and all, but there is little meat on the bone if you look at it more closely. Still, the game is not very long, so no big drawback.\nAt some point the battles will become a bit drawn out and you'll find yourself battling just for the XP and maybe some oculi loot. That's a shame, considering you'll spend so much time battling. Personally, considering the style of the game, I would have preferred spending more time exploring the world.","October 1, 2015","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The battle music is epic and reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII. The turn-based combat is nicely unique with the option of using your little glow-worm friend to slow down opponents and heal allies, giving you the chance to get that all important potion or cast in before you're anhilated. Combat is not your usual one-shot-as-you-go, and I admit a couple of the boss fights have taken me a couple of attempts. There is also a nice option to switch out your allies mid-fight to give you the upper edge. Game is not quick to play - the story unwinds slowly as you meet new characters. I've been playing for about 2.5 hours and have only just reached chapter 4/10. The skill/talent tree is also reminiscent of the Final Fantasy games. The puzzles are interesting to complete.\n\nAs a bonus, if you're playing this single-player, you also get to control your little friend too, which can be a bit tricky to manage both to begin with, but you soon get the hang of it.\n\nThe only downfall I found was the jumping - until you recieve the ability to fly, the jumps are very tight and can be difficult to make with a controller as I couldn't quite get the right diagonal key-press. I found myself putting down the controller and using the directional arrows on my keyboard to complete the jumps - much easier. This, obviously, is no longer an issue once you gain flying.\n\nOverall I give this game 10/10. It's fun, quirky, engaging, and not over-simplified. And guys - don't dismiss this game as being girly. Give it a try, you never know you might like it!","October 7, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes. Does it matter? No.\n\n\n- Art :  First of all right on the title screen i can see a lot of love and care went into this game. Theres a few details i'd like to point out like a giant moving in the background. and There is one point when when you here lightning you can see a afce appear for a few seconds little details like that are what make this game amazing. I hope whoever did the art in this game does many more games in the future.\n\n\n-Sound/music : The sound track is simply amazing i could listen to it for hours on end. My faorite is actually the victory theme to the game   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYr0a4yb_QI  I won't talk about just that thoug. When your explaoring the world you get really sucked in listening to the music and looking at the art that its just amazing. Words really can't describe how good it is.\n\n-Gamplay : Like any normal jrpg you have as some say a gradian styled turn based battle. each character takes a turn depending on how fast they are. However they made a litle twist to keep it fresh and new. During "casting time"  if you get attacked and or your enemy get's attacked  you can inturpt the turn flow. how is this usefull ?\n\nSome skills have a short , medium , long ,very long casting times.  depending on what the enemy uses you can avoid a really big attack. Also your firefly friend can slow an enemy down which is also really usefull at times.\n\nExploring the world is also like any rpg though i you played metroid you will find it to be more of  metroidvania game then anything which is a good thing who doesn't like metroidvania games?\n\n\n- Overall : To all you uplay haters your missing out on a great game. It deserves to be played by all. If your a fan of rpgs in general pick it up. You will not be disapointed.","May 7, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"oh, okay.  well, join me!"  ...wait, who the hell is this girl again, and why am I not seeing more out of their relationship than that?)  and the side-character controllable by the mouse is a bit out of place - he just doesn't flow like the rest of the game, and it's a bit jarring.  but it's definitely been enjoyable so far.\n\nUplay is frustrating, though...I wish I could just disable it.  it's just extra steps and extra notifications I don't care about.

Once I accepted the sadness that is so intertwined with every element, I grew so much closer to Child of Light. It's easy to heap praise on the combat because it's so engaging, and it's certainly a high point in this adventure. That's not what makes Child of Light stand out, though. Rather, it's how confident it is in its own feelings of woe. There are so few games willing to explore that dull ache that I became mesmerized by Aurora's journey, even when I needed to step away from her plight while I regained my composure. Child of Light is a wonderfully realized, somber adventure, and I couldn't be happier that such a game exists.\n\nIgnore the Uplay naysayers; it really doesn't change anything.","October 8, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's simple, but as the plot progresses you need to employ new strategies and be smarter to keep up with new enemy variants. Child of Light is addicting and entices exploration. It's not far into the game that you gain a new power to roam around with which makes the game much more enjoyable and opens up the 2D map extensively to reveal a much larger world than you realized. Playing alone is fun in itself, but one of my favorite features in Child of Light is the cooperative mechanic that allows for another person to join in to help explore and fight through use of the mouse. Cooperative play adds a whole new element of teamwork as your partner can use the mouse to heal the party or slow enemies while you plan the next move.\n\nThe story and presentation of Child of Light is charmingly reminiscent of a classic Disney movie. The journey of Princess Aurora as she finds her way through a magical woods to find a way to save her father, while not breaking ground in storytelling, has that classic fairytale vibe that harkens the mind to more innocent and simple times. As you journey through the woods you'll come across several companions to join your party. While the cast of characters is diverse and their interactions amusing, you'll find yourself using only a couple through the length of the game--bringing an additional one or two out to deal with certain enemy types. This didn't really bother me, but it's to be expected when you have this many characters in your party in such a short game.\n\nI suppose that's my only gripe with Child of Light--it felt short, but that may be because a friend and I beat it in the length of a day. I got it on sale and don't regret what I payed, but I can't help but feel thankful I didn't pay full price. Regardless, I had a blast exploring and fighting bosses with my friend. If you like RPG's with turn-based battle mechanics or a story that harkens back to the classic Disney Princess tales of yore, then you will enjoy Child of Light.","January 5","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The appropriate music, art and rhyming will keep you until completion. However, the story is extremely generic and the equipment system is as simple as it gets.

But it's by no means a game solely for children. There are very few games that are similar, but I'd say that you will like Child Of Light if you enjoyed Trine, Ori And The Blind Forest, Superbrothers: S&S, or even Fable TLC. The rhyming dialogue can get a bit irritating at some point, but all in all, the story, art and soundtrack make for a beautiful little game, which is quite a rare thing to come from Ubisoft nowadays","July 14, 2015","true","23.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

E.g, main character fumbles around a lot while wielding/using her sword because it is practically the same size as her\n\nAudio\n-Eargasmic fully orchestrated soundtracks\n-Music styles range from lighthearted disneylike bgm to intense, adrenaline pumping musical scores to sombre, lonely, melancholic pieces\n-Soundtracks that play during normal monster battles are so epic that they feel more like final boss battles instead\n-Much effort and detail put into sound effects for every little thing. E.g., sound of barefeet stepping on wet rock as your character moves around a dark forest, or the metal tinkering sound of the crown when it hits the floor\n\nStory\n-Straight out of a fairytale, but with a slightly dark and gloomy atmosphere replacing the usual happy, uplifting mood found in these type of stories\n-Some nice plot twists and turn of events that match well with the sorrowful mood of the story, but otherwise, fairly straight forward like most fairytales\n-despite the generally sombre feeling of the story, still heartwarming at times\n-At its core, a coming-of-age story. People looking for something with an intricate and deep plot will be disappointed\n\nCharacters\n-With the plot being reminiscent of a disney movie, likewise the characters also follow suit (talking animals/ mythological creatures)\n-Charming/cute characters that compliment each other well due to their distinctive personalities and character traits\n-Main character (Aurora)  is an incredibly cute and sweet, but brave little girl. (Very likeable protagonist)\n\nDialogue\n-Everything is spoken in rhymes; adds to the cuteness/fairytaleness of the story, but may become annoying for some people as the game progresses\n\nGameplay\n-Old school turn based combat with several added twists\n-Order of turns in combat dictated by a timeline mechanic, which is further influenced by an interruption mechanic when characters are attacked during the 'casting' part of the timeline\n-Timeline/interruption/cursor mechanic help add to the tension/unpredictability of fights and fosters strategic elements unique to these mechanics (e.g, knowing when it is worth using weak, but fast speed attacks to interrupt enemies VS straight brute force killing the monsters with strong but long cast time spells)\n-However, at its heart, it is still turn based battle, so it will not appeal to all people despite the previously mentioned mechanics that speed up the flow of battle\n\nRecommend to everyone but the most diehard haters of turn-based battle.\n\nOh, and theres Uplay. ♥♥♥♥ Uplay.\n\nBut seriously though, it's worth the hassel of installing and signing up for Uplay to experience this game.

I just wanted to say that this is an awesome RPG with beautiful graphics and with a great mix of platforming.\n\nPros\nThis game has a sufficient amount of interesting enemies that love the dark, but want to kill you.\nYou can upgrade your protaganist using the skill points you have earned through leveling up.\nYou can distract enemies to avoid engaging in an RPG by shining your partner at them.\nYou can equip a gem to your attacks, armor, or weapons to power them up or give them a buff.\nI love the hair flow physics it just makes the game feel more magical.Now let us talk about the bad parts of the game(Don't let this convince you into not getting the game if you were thinking about it).\n\nCons\nYour character walks slow for a dramatic fantasy effect(that or my frame rates are low).\nThe wait for executing your turn in the unique RPG battle system is just a hair bit long. It would probably be better if it was a bit shorter.\nYour partner can distract the enemies during an RPG battle during the waiting term, but loses stamina while doing that.\nIn dark areas you need to not only light your partner up, but also move him throught the area as well.","March 29","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The soundtrack, the watercolor background, the immersive story. It genuinely makes you care about the characters. The only complaints I have are that the 10 hours that you get to play it through aren't enough. Second, there's so much to explore. As in most open-world games I try not to stray to far from the intended path of the game until beating it, and miss out on tons of side-quests that improve the game, but I found I never cared if I spent 20 minutes exploring a cave when I should have been saving Lemuria. Every single moment I played this game has been awesome. The combat mechanics are simple to learn and are an awesome variation from boring regular turn-based combat. I can not stop saying good things about this game, it is truly a work of art and I definitely recommend getting it.\n\nI'd also recommend the Golem's Plight DLC pack, as having another character on the team helps a lot and the Golem is a lot of fun to use. The Dark Aurora skin is my personal favorite, though the heal skill of the Light Pack is very useful. If you feel like spending an extra $7, get the Light and Dark Packs, and the Golem's Plight.

The gameplay is "unique" with its realtime but turn based battles and a dash of puzzles.

It's got a battle system that's similar to the JRPG Grandia series, which is a lot of fun.  Battles have a timeline where characters and enemies have to wait until it's their turn and actions take differing amounts of time to perform.  Get hit during your action time and you get interrupted.  The same goes for enemies.  Strategy gets enhanced by buffs/debuffs, counters, and the ability to swap characters instantly on your turn.\n\nI was able to get through on Expert fairly easily without any time spent grinding for levels, although I didn't avoid any enemies as I enjoyed the battle system too much.  Leveling up grants you skill points which you can spend on one of 3 branches of the skill tree.","July 3, 2015","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, I bought it during the Steam summer sale for 3,74€, I can say that this amount of money is well worth for the game. It took me a little over 9 hours to finish this game and I can say that it was time well spent. However, I dont see myself replaying this game at all. It's like one of thoose books where once you know who is the killer it doesnt motivate you to reread it because you know what will happen in the story. Your actions in the game doesnt alter the game ending in any way.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is indeed kinda childish. I can see my younger sister to enjoy it, since she love stories like this but this game was definitely not made for adults. Its not the story and the characters which kept me playing this game, even the combat can be repetetive after some time.... but it was the execution and the presentation of the game which was presented to the player in a very stylish fashion. I cant say that I agree with the full price on this game, but if you can manage to get it for 50%-75% off, I say go for it. It is a beautiful one time ride.","June 21, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Fast paced battles that require genuine strategy and timing, and by the end I was literally using every single character in order to finish the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nintendeaux/recommended/256290/","nintendeaux","Wiiconnaissance","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nintendeaux/","205 products in account","Having previously played this on Wii U, I decided to buy this on sale and see what the PC version offered.\n\nFor the record: I do not hate uPlay. If you are an uPlay hater... well, hate away, you will not find that here. However, you will be unable to play the game if an uPlay update is available. And since my internet stinks, waiting for an update that takes about 27 minutes to complete is a pain. At least on the Wii U I can click, "Start Software" while an update is downloading. No such luck on this, so if you have slow internet, be weary. The updates are far and few between, but they are there.\n\nChild of Light is a turn-based RPG. It's fun. It's engrossing. It's gorgeous. And the music is just amazing throughout. I will focus the bulk of this review on the turn-based element as it is essential to playing the game and completing all tasks ahead of you.\n\nYes, you have a main quest, but along the way, you find that your friends have problems of their own and you will need to venture off and solve their problems, too. Do not worry, the story does not usually stray from stronger monsters, so you are usually well-matched.\n\nYou control two characters at a time, which is a little few considering most people enjoy the four-player turn-based times of old. Do not be discouraged, as you can swap on the fly both characters, as long as it is their turn. So if you are low on health or lack the protection from the element your current enemy dishes out, you are able to switch to another character and start anew on that turn.\n\nNOTE: If you are in the 'wait-window' (where you are about to act out your play decision for that character), your new swap-in will go back to the beginning of that wait line (not the beginning of the turn) and depending on their overall speed, perhaps a little further back from the line. You won't necessarily lose a lot of time for that turn, but you will not come in mid-stroke and deliver a promising blow. If an enemy is between the wait line and where your previous character sat, it will go before your new arrival takes action.\n\nYour characters do not equip armor or anything, this is supplemented by Oculi, small gems. These can be combined three at a time to make a stronger version of itself. You equip one on your weapon, your clothing or your timeline. On your weapon you can gain elemental damage, the higher version the gem, the more percentage the damage and sometimes a combat action effect like paralysis. Same for your clothing, however, it is for elemental protection and defense effects like +EXP bonus or a +ALL Element protection or physical/magical defense across the board. The timeline connection brings to fruition +Evasion while casting, +Interruption of enemy in Wait status, +Stats, +Casting Speed and a good one, dtarting on the timeline further out than normal.\n\nThese oculi are few in the first six chapters, so you will bounce between three or four main characters at first, until you can get more in the end-game for flexing your strategy. Do not let this discourage you though, between every battle you can switch the oculi to whomever you want and the process is a speedy one. And uPlay even lets you buy more through their reward process if you want to spend some uPlay credits (although I did not take this route, and probably will not).\n\nIf you try to stick to the same two characters, you will find it far more difficult to proceed after Chapter 6. Up until then you will be okay and will be able to mix and match and learn each characters strengths and weaknesses. Each character is diverse. You will not find any two alike but in a way or three. Take Aurora for instance, she can heal, but she cannot revive like Rubella. Aurora has Starlight, effective against Dark, but only Finn has elemental damage against the other elements. Unless of course you use oculi on another characters weapon, but even then the damage will be far less than Finn's magical prowess.\n\nIt's good stuff. This game shines in the dark. I thoroughly enjoyed it on both Wii U and here on PC.\n\nNow all that aside, you will still find fun collecting the stardust (permanent stat increase), potions, oculi and confessions (notes to bring light to some lore) scattered across the land. But be prepared to fight. To get everything this game has to offer, you will need to master the combat mechanic and lay waste to many an enemy. It is a good thing all characters level-up together so you will not have to gather clean-up experience later because you will be able to switch your characters and oculi throughout and build a strategy worthy of your name.","February 18","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But I guess Uplay showed me some mercy (not that I really care for Uplay anyway) and allowed me to play the game. And for what I have seen so far, (which isn't much) I love it. its that peaceful game with intense action sequences that I've always wanted (I've so far only found 3 games that fit into that category, namely Dust: an Elysian Tail, Shadow of the Colossus and now, this game). It's a very light hearted adventure with amusing characters, and some banter between our two main heroes. Also what an appropriate time to buy this as it does give off a very soothing autumn-esque feel. But I'm not gonna lie some of the enemies are just outright daunting. I was pretty startled when one of them screamed and leaped at me when I least expected it.\n\nLets talk about the visuals for a second because this game is gorgeous. The animation is baby skin smooth and  heavily sprite based, as in some enemies have each limb seperatly animated but lets not get too off track here. The fact that this game was and RPG kinda turned me off on it and yeah it's simple. But DAMN does it get intense. also battles are a bit interactive which gives them a bit of flare (literally) and keeps you from getting disinterested.\n\nIts not fully voice acted which I find a bit of a shame because I like to voice my characters as I play my RPG's. And I ain't no little girl, I'm a man... teenager... male.\n\nBut with that My final verdict so far is\n9.5 out of 10\n\nWith my ownly gripe being that its not fully voice acted but since I'm not even close to being half-way through the game,  that might change\nthe 9.5 is also for the poor souls who can't play this this beautiful game without bad framerate or even start it up because of Uplay\nAnd that hair... Too much hair...\n\n-Time for an update-\n\nAfter completing the game I was a bit shocked as people weren't kidding. The game is SHORT. And I'm fine with that, but it seemed a bit TOO short for an RPG. This will affect my final grade for it though, but not by much. There were some nice twists, but nearing the end the story began to seem a bit rushed and I would have liked a *SPOILERS PROBABLY* bit more build up to the epic final boss of the game. Maybe one little mini-dungeon to go through to prepare a little more. (not that I was underprepared or anything) But it just all happended so fast and it killed a bit of the climactic feeling. But I still don't regret my purchase because my grade has only changed to:\n\n9.0 outta 10 - Would play again.","November 29, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some really cool boss fights, but towards the end, they start to feel like they recycled the ideas.\n\nThe fighting system was decent -- the interrupt timing system makes it so it isn't just mindless spamming attack (like many of the greatest rpg's unfortunately do). The mouse (faerie) clicking mechanic to heal allies/slow enemies was nice, again, perhaps they could've done more with it.\n\nThe cast of characters are good, but I wish there was more synergy between them in battle; also I would've liked some more fluid combat to keep the pace rolling.\n\nThe gem crafting system was nice, but there weren't enough gems to properly equip all your characters, so maybe they want to relook at that system, since it has potential. I never had to use a single item throughout the game.\n\nBeautiful art, good music (although also recycled). There is good potential here if they decide to do some sort of sequel or spiritual successor. The game was very good and could have been great.\n\nWorth getting (on sale), the Golem character dlc is skippable. You won't miss much. Although he is a good character, the game is well balanced without him and he feels like a little bit too much given how diverse the party becomes. Also his story/dialogue is somewhat forgettable (wise old sentry, strong body, but missing something inside, providing wisdom to characters about finding themselves... yep, not cliched at all).\n\n6-7/10","July 27, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dearfenrir/recommended/256290/","dearfenrir","TheRoguishType","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dearfenrir/","200 products in account","Child of Light is a 10-15 hour game that incorporates elements of turn-based rpgs and platforming in order to weave a tale of fantasy and lost kingdoms.  Immediately striking is the use of water-color inspired backdrops and lighting effects. Each new area and set piece within the game was designed with the same level of care and detail that one would expect from traditional art. The soundtrack, as well as the tone of the storyline, invokes a strange sense of nostalgia for fairy tales and children’s books. Without divulging any spoilers, there are elements of the storyline that mirror tales by Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm. And much like these authors tales there lays a certain air of darkness and sadness to the story narrative of Child of Light. Despite this, I consider the game to be suitable for kids.\n\nThe gameplay element was both familiar and simplistic, however the use of the right analog stick to assist in puzzle solving added a bit of flavor and variety to the platforming. Battles were fought using a turn-based system, with the ability to slow or speed up a character or enemy along in the timeline. This allowed for interesting "on-the-fly" decisions that made the combat fun and allowed for a bit of strategy to be incorporated. XP is awarded after winning battles which can be used to develop a skill tree. Each character the player encounters in the game will have various "specialty" skills, and each may be switched out during combat. There is also a crafting feature in the game that will result in various gems that will "buff" certain skills in battle.\n\nOverall, the game was not very difficult. I found the puzzle solving to be a somewhat shallow, and even the combat, albeit seemingly deep within the first few hours, became mechanical and grinding towards the end. However, the overarching experience of Child of Light was satisfying and charming. The amount of work put into creating the fantastical and whimsical atmosphere of Child of Light is what will remain long after the game's conclusion. I would recommend this game. 8/10","October 14, 2014","true","11.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The actual gameplay is sort of an evolution from classic turn-based RPGs (e.g. FF6) where you have 2 active characters at any given time but can swap characters out anytime it's your turn. On normal it didn't require a great deal of strategy to get through most fights (a couple were scary for sure even so), I imagine it's a bit brutal on the harder difficulty.\n\nIt may seem short for a story-telling RPG but it really is just about a perfect length for itself. Highly recommend this game, goes up on the top-tier shelf and is another excellent example of how a game can both be fun and tell a story in a unique way.

As I have been so severely let down by triple A titles lately, this seemed like a much needed break.\n\nI will sum up everything below in this sentence: Child of Light is the sumation of the genre of RPGs, and an experience I find *essential* to any gamers repitoire.\n\nThis game started out slow, as many RPGs do, but I was swiftly entranced in what was going on, and suddenly I was 10 hours in and micromanaging my inventory as I panicked about the fact that it was suddenly 5am on a work day. As your party grows, alongside your powers, you may have difficulty deciding who to power up, who to play up, and who to bench, I know I did. I've just prior to writing this discovered a new game plus mode, which I will be devoting this next weekend to. Now I want to break down the game into parts.\n\nGraphics 5/5\nNow I know this game had such a different style of graphics, but I have to say, it so acurately represents the style it brings, I can't not love it. The fact that I could actually feel accurate depth with the style, and on multiple occasions, that came into play.\n\nStory 5/5\nYes, it has some of the basics of any RPG, good vs. evil, light vs. dark, and family matters. However, it plays it so well, and makes you care so much, that you get excited and upset, and as someone who not often pines for anything less than a hurt puppy, this is a major deal.\n\nGameplay 3/5\nNow, don't get me wrong, I loved the gameplay. The combat in this game is one of my favorite features, with how smooth and dynamic it is, yet while being so simple. The only thing is, I know that I like, but I can see where others wouldn't. If you are not a traditional RPGer, and especially level grinder, you may have some rough spots.\n\nOverall score 9.1/10\nWhile exceedingly beautiful and excelling at exactly what it is, the game has a few faults for those not used to the idea of level grinding, and your finger might cramp a bit from using your firefly companion. However, I would reccomend this game to anyone willing to hear me out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","May 28, 2014","true","33.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's beautiful, sometimes sad, sometimes cute... but it always flows, never grinds which is the key.    It's not long to finish, but it's priced very well for what it gives.  Other people like the combat.   Combat and the talent trees are easy to get the hang of it.   Crafting is a little more experiment and learn.   And put together there's a lot of choice.   On the other hand, the game is less challenging in terms of puzzles and combat if you're looking for that...it's pretty easy to never die.   But, this is really about moving and flowing through beautiful and changing scenery and characters and a tragic but still uplifting storyline (compared to the grindingly depressing "Banner Saga").     Plus your situation as Aurora is emotional and interesting and a fair bit different than the usual video game fare.","May 30, 2014","true","54.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its mainly the soundtrack. If you look at the videos of the soundtracks on youtube, they are flooded with positive comments. Everyone loves the songs and ugh just the love for this game is amazing haha. Once you finish the game, listen to the soundtrack and just cry, again.\n\nThe Artwork of the game was amazing. It was so beautiful, you were literally flying around in a giant painting. Games rendered in a watercolor style is so beautiful in my opinion, I couldn't help but to squeal at every new map that I encountered haha. xD One can tell that a TON of effort went into the making of this game. Just from looking at the backgrounds which at first glance, don't seem like much but to anyone interested in art. The lighting and coloring of everything blends together so well and its just so UNF.\n\n\n\nThe +/- of the game. (depends on perspective)\n\nUplay/Ubisoft (The biggest concern I had while I was contemplating buying this game..) I guess since Uplay is mentioned on here(in the cons section) I might as well talk about the benefits about Uplay, unlike those Uplay ragers from the reviews of the game earlier in the year mentioned, Uplay isn't bad at all. (Biased opinion because I faced no problems from it but..) Uplay actually gives you these Uplay coin token things as you play the game, and with those coins, you can buy stuff. So for all of those DLC's that you've been wanting, half of them are on Uplay. You can purchase (with Uplay coins) and download backgrounds and stuff. Of course the soundtrack to support the artist is on Steam, and that one DLC that includes a new party member is also on steam. If anything really the DLC's on steam offer you 2 outfit changes and a new party member, because sure the others offers extra occuli, but you find them randomly in the game anyways. (Sometimes, even monsters drop them), so Uplay isn't all that bad, and the DLC's that Steam offers arent bad either. Half of those DLC's that you guys are complaining and bichin' about, are on Uplay. (more stuff on Uplay is at the bottom of the review.)\n\nThe Price (?) Some people complained about the length of the game, but I thought that the game length matched the price, if anything I think that the price is just right. (The extreme fans of CoL can of course argue with me on this) Many people complained about the length of the game not matching of the price or the worth of the game, but that shouldn't be an issue, because one can just replay the game, in a harder mode if you found the game too short or too easy. I'm going to do that. (I played on Casual, like the scared little noob gamer I am) I heard that it provides more challenges, (and many deaths haha.)\n\nThe 3D on 2D The only thing that I disliked was that Aurora was 3D. Dispite the background being in 2D with with different layers in the background moving to add a bit of deph into the otherwise flat looking background, the main characters looking 3D looked a bit out of place in my opinion. I just would have preferred for the few characters (including Aurora) to be in 2D along with the bg, but I knew that would have been hard work since Aurora doesen't sit still, she flies around so I understand that its just easier for her and the few other characters to be 3D. It just bothered my eye while playing the game.\n\nThe Rhyme If you don't like for all of the characters to talk in rhyme (It is slant rhyme I believe) this game will be annoying for you. If you can tolerate it and not give the game a negative review just because they talk in rhyme, or because of Ubisoft, thank you. The rhyme isn't for everyone and thats okay. Scurry along somewhere else, don't just bash the rhyme.\n\nThe Style Of The Story The story itself is also very Disney like. Its basically a fairytale. Its not hard to follow at all, I think that because of the way that the game was made that it can appeal to all ages besides the very young children because they may not understand the full story. Such as Aurora's flashes of vision that the fountains granted her of what the fk was going on at home. Some people complained about there being no background information on the game. I think that the game gave all of the information that one needed to know at the beginning. And the rest of the surprises that the game throws at the player is just y'know cut scenes that are supposed to add problems and drama into the story to make it interesting.. If you pay attention to whats going on, its not difficult at all to follow.\n\nThe Fights Oh the fights there were so many complains about it. I didn't like it. It was a first for me for this type of fighting system where it was turn based. It was not difficult in terms of strategy. With different skills/abilities/spells, and your firefly friend Sir Igniculus, you can make it so that you attack more than said turn. I didn't mind it. Sure the battles were always the same. Figure out weaknesses of the enemy and kill them. You have many friends who you can switch out in the midst of the battle, whom all have different abilities and specialties which can make it somewhat more interesting than just having Aurora slash at enemies with her sword, yes? It also kept the game balanced, I mean if you were able to have like all 5 of your allies (if even 5) out to attack like 3 enemies at max of course the game'd be too easy. It limited the game in the fighting system to make it so that the battles are worth thinking about. Like do you take out a fellow damage dealer for a support character who can heal/buff you? There were not many possibilities but did require me to think a bit as I played. BUT if its strategy that you are looking for my friend, there is not much to this game in terms of the battles. I recommend setting the game to hardcore mode or something. There are also only like 3 songs that play depending on the battle. Its the same for when just grinding mobs (to level up, and its all optional too, I mean. You should.. level up to even have a chance at defeating the boss..) the only times that I've noticed the soundtrack change was in big boss fights which you will encounter as the story progresses.\n\n\n\nThe Cons.\n\nProblems with the Game I had little to no problems with it. I've read a lot of the other reviews and heard others bichin' about how because of UPlay that they don't recommend it... But honestly I thought that Uplay wasn't a problem. If anything those problems with Uplay being down and stuff, I think that those problems are fixed now because in the few days that I've played Child of Light and finished it, I had never had Uplay exiting the game for me, or for that manner, and problems from or dealing with Uplay. My game was never disrupted. The worst that it got was the second to half of second of lag that went away immediatley while I flew around in the map. Or of how sometimes in some of the battles, Aurora had no hair. It didn't bother me that much because to be honest, it was only one battle out of how many now? And the few times that it happened, it wasn't in the major boss fights so it was fine for me. Other than that I had no techincal difficulties with the game.","July 6, 2014","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game (as with other ubisoft games) requires the installation of Uplay, which is a game launcher that runs outside of steam. Every time you play it does make you log in to Uplay, and while some view this as the biggest annoyance in the world, I honestly don't mind Uplay and barely notice it anymore. Now that I have this covered I will break down the rest of the game in readable chunks.\n\nMenu Interface - 9 - I played the game with a controller pad, and found everything accessible, my only minor complaint is in the crafting screen where it can get frustrating to remove gems.\n\nOpen World Interface - 10 - Playing outside of combat is a thing of beautiful and fluid experience, not once did I feel like Aurora or Igneous was not an extension of myself. Exploration and loot gathering is well paced, and still offers a challenge for those completionists out there. Puzzles and open world dangers offer complexity and can require fluid control, but did not frustrate me or deter my desire to explore. Engaging combat is controllable, and the few times I was ambushed by a well placed enemy it was honestly fun.\n\nCombat Interface - 9 - Turn based combat has a nostalgic grab for me personally, and I can say Child of Light does it right. The default combat speed gradually introduces you to the flow of combat, and once you feel you have it locked down you can up the speed for a more seamless experience with quicker progression. My only wish is that I could have a third party member on the board during combat. UbiArt made up for this by allowing on the fly member switching, but I still felt like combat would have been more dynamic with a third member on the board, that said the use of Igneous as support was executed beautifully.\n\nStory - 8 - The story of Aurora is enticing and tugged at my heart strings. Her journey through the fantastical world Lumaria expresses personal growth and paints vivid a picture of the pain involved with growing up. While Aurora’s story felt deep and heartfelt, I found myself wanting more depth behind the support characters in addition to their small side quests.\n\nVisuals - 10 - I took so many screenshots during my first playthrough I lost count. This game is a testament to how great side scrolling (semi 3D) games can look. Countless times I found myself saying how great the game looked out loud to myself, my girlfriend, or through social media.\n\nAudio - 9 - Visuals are important and most gamers put an emphasis on “graphics” as their point of reference to game quality. I am of the opinion that visuals and audio work hand in hand, and Child of Light uses its music to create an immersive atmosphere that compliments its visuals like a twin sibling. My only gripe is that some of the sound effects can get loud and in a few instances became slightly irritating to the point where I turned down the volume. Aside from this small pet peeve, I could not possibly express how touching and appropriate the music is, and has found a place in my playlists.\n\nI could not be happier with my purchase of this game. I was excited to play it months ago, and it has surpassed every expectation I had. Any fan of RPG’s, music, art, and well told stories will enjoy what Child of light brings to the table. I hope this review helps any who are on the fence decide to give this game a shot, you will not be disappointed.\n","May 7, 2014","true","24.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With its impeccable artwork and illustrious plot/dialogue, Child of Light never fails to succeed in drawing me deeper into the world of Lemuria.\n\nGameplay was interesting, simple and reminds one of the old school turn based Final Fantasy battle style. Although only 2 characters can be used at any one time, the mechanics are simple and really easy to understand.\n\nFurthermore, battles are surprisingly just as lively and beautiful as the game. Characters also level easily and there's absolutely no need to grind! (Unless you tend to skip battles actively!)\n\nCharacter development was done really well, and the repertoire of characters with their lively dialogues truly brings the game to life.\n\nFor only $15, this game is honestly quite the steal! I am even willing to pay $30 for this treasure!\n\nMost importantly, the soundtrack is just so beautiful and in synchrony with the plot that as a casual gamer, I really took my time to listen in and enjoy the calming melodies the game has to offer. Definitely getting the entire soundtrack!\n\nHighly recommend this to any casual gamers out there who wants to enjoy 11-13 hours of a beautifully drawn masterpiece and live out your conventional fairytale in Child of Light! C:\n\nP.S. I thought the trailer seemed kinda childish at first but the first hour of gameplay showed me how wrong I am to judge this game so quickly at face value, hope everyone out there enjoys this game!

Of all the RPGs I've played, the battle system in Child of Light is one of my favorites. Admittedly, the remaining RPG elements are simplified: Stats are gained solely through levels and stat-pumping items, and each character has 3 armor "slots" for various gems. The customization is a little limited in that respect, but I think that to be appropriate given the semi-casual nature of the game.\n\nOf course, there's an easy mode (which I do NOT recommend) for those who just want the story.\n\ntl;dr - Good artwork, music, nice spin on RPG gameplay, 4.5/5.

It's a very simple JRPG\n\n- linear story/path\n- 8 Characters + DLC with 3 Skill trees each and set "classes"/niches\n- turned based battle, 2 party vs. 3 monster with time bar thing for turns\n- very simple, still very customizable augmenting\n- minimal inventory management (just pots)\n\nbut it's very "open" in the sense that there's no waypoints, minimaps, or directions. Usually there's only one way to go, but you stay in very big maps that are kinda easy to get lost in. Hidden treasures are plenty.\n\nMost of the difficulty is in battles. You get a little sprite/Navi like thing for your mouse (kinda like Super Mario Galaxy) that opens chests, does puzzles, and "stuns" enemies so touching them won't trigger a battle on the map. In battle, you use it to slow (a single) enemy, and heal yourself. He has his own energy bar. This, along with being able to rotate party members instantly during battle + gem customization + timing your actions to cause interrupts (attacking an enemy during the red part of the bar) means if you're good enough you can do fights without every getting attacked.\n\nHigher skillcap than an average JRPG fight, much more active.\n\nArt and music are beautiful and probably worth the game alone. The script is very childish. Everything rhymes (it's kinda cute), very poetic. Sometimes a little cheesy, in a funny way.\n\nStory reminds me a little of Bastion - where you're curious as to what happened and the characters all have backgrounds that make you want to learn more, but this game's not the most story driven.\n\nJust good combat, very engaging but not stressful play, and a relaxing artstyle.\n\nDo it.\n\nThe only downside really is that you need UPlay. Glhf awful game.\n\nActual annoying parts though - while there's saveslots, there's also no save button and it's all autosave. I'm a save every 30 seconds kinda guy so it bugs me a little. But it autosaves really often (there's a spinning circle in the bottom right). Also, it's hard to gauge a sense of progress. There's a worldmap, but it only shows places you've been to and you don't really know where they are). The game is subdivided into Chapters but I don't know how many there are.\n\nDLC is okay - I don't really like the skins. Haven't done the character one yet though.","June 26, 2014","true","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

La jugabilidad es simple pero no por ello se hace pesado o aburrido.\n\nLa dificultad no llega a ser un reto en el modo casual pero si lo suficiente para no sentir que no tienes que pensar los movimientos.\nEs un juego realmente no te arrepientes de comprar ya que se disfruta tanto en jugabilidad (Difiere sustancialmente de la mayoria de juegos actuales) como en historia, la cual si bien no da grandes giros, su universo, dialogos y personajes atrapan lo suficiente para mantenerte enganchado.\n\nAlgo negativo a destacar es que debes instalar uplay por narices lo cual crea en primer lugar el doble sistema de logue y logros y por otra parte imposibilita compartir el juego con el sistema de Steam Family.\nAparte es practicamente necesario jugar a nueva partida+ si quieres llegar a nivel máximo y conseguir varias de las mejores gemas, algo practicamente obligatorio para los fans de los RPG clásicos.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHighly recommended, visually stunning and a marvelous soundtrack. The gameplay is simple but not boring nor repetitive.\n\nThe difficulty does not become a challenge in casual mode but is enough to feel you have to think about the plays.\nIt's a game that really you won't regret to buy, because both gameplay (differs substantially from most current games) and history ( which is a common one but his universe, dialogues and characters attract enough to keep playing. ) is highly enjoyable.\n\nOne negative part is that you must install Uplay, that first creates twice login and achievements systems (ubisoft and steam ofc) and otherwise its impossible to share the game with Steam Family.\nMoreover is necessary play new game + if you want to reach the highest level and get more of the best gems, and that is practically mandatory for classic RPG fans (or hardcore players XD).","June 27, 2014","true","25.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has wonderful imagery and the atmosphere is set well. The combat system is similar to the active time battle system in older final fantasy games, with a few twists. Also the game has a touch of 2d side scrolling as you explore the world you're in. The game isn't too short, but it is easy, so if you want a challenge with your RPG then stick the difficulty up to expert. Replay value comes in the form of a New Game + mode after you finish, which keeps your skills and Occuli from your save file, in return for harder opponents.\n\nIn short for the price this is a really well made rpg, and if you're curious about the genre and whether you would like this give it a shot.

Flying was fun until I had to navigate smaller spaces, in which I found I was often crashing the sides and hurting myself. I didn’t so much enjoy the battles, as they got a bit repetitive. It's a platformer with RPG stats, but I found I wasn't interested in the stats. Also the Oculli crafting system felt rushed with some chance buffs not that helpful in battle.                Story        8        I liked moments of the story, but wasn’t completely enthralled. I liked the idea of the story being told in a rhyme, but eventually I was cringing at it. Perhaps a better story could’ve been told without the nursery rhymes constricting it.                Graphics        10        I really enjoyed the graphics of Child of Light. I found it was beautiful to look at, and while flying around the art and environment was wonderful. It felt very much like a children’s storybook and the art style looked hand painted.                Audio        9.5        I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this game. The music here really set the mood at the appropriate moments. The sounds in the game were fitting and often guided/alerted me when I was begrudgingly entering battle.                Replayability        3        While it was a relatively fun game to play, I can’t see myself continuing to maximize my character’s stats/abilities any further, let alone replaying the game again. With a decent story and gameplay, I have no wishes to return to Lemuria.                Overall        7.5        Child of Light set me in a beautiful place called Lemuria. The music added to the tranquil beauty. But the controls felt awkward at times, though didn’t hinder me too much. I want to love the story, but unfortunately I couldn’t get passed the rhyming.\nMore reviews by One\n\n\n\n\nGame Soundtrack on YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6KcYN0A5LY","October 9, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Every character has his own niche and are all good in their own rights. They all have their individual skill trees that will increase their stats and unlock new abilities. There are also gems in the game that serve as equipment for your party members, and they can be combined into newer and stronger gems.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nThe background is pretty cool, drawn in a free flowing, paint brush style. There's nothing really super flashy or impressive in the characters and animations, but there are also very few eyesores.\n\nContent: 2/10\nThis is the biggest selling point, or lack thereof. I personally finished the first playthrough of the game in about 15 hours, and this includes a moderate amount of grinding and looting (both can be skipped). The game is too easy; there are autosaves at literally everything you do, enter a door, beat an enemy, open a chest, etc etc. There are no penalties for death, if you can even manage that; one can heal up to full HP/MP at any point in the game with the help of Igniculus and wishes. There's also a new game+ option, but this is farily trivial, as it is easier than the first playthrough. XP gains are boosted, causing all characters to be fairly overleveled have most of the important skills when they are needed. After beating the second playthrough, the game doesn't get any harder, so trying to beat the game a third time will only result in one hitting most enemies along the way. I was pretty hyped to be able to max out all of the characters and gems (which is actually pretty time consuming), only to realize that there's nothing to use my powered up party members on.\n\nOverall, not recommended if you want a long term investment like an in-depth RPG. It was entertaining while it lasted though.","October 14, 2015","false","27.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The current patch has terrible problems with Nvidia Optimus (if you own a laptop you probably have this). Child Of Light is not recognized by Nvidia as a game "worth using the GPU." As a result, the game is forced to use intergrated graphics thus running the fps down to abysmal levels (dropping as low as 20fps). Ubisoft claims this has been fixed but I see no proof for any Geforce 700 series cards.\n\nThat being said... The game is still amazing. Any other game running this way would never see play time. Even with the "slow motion" frame rate problems the game is so captivating and beautiful that I can actually look past it.\nThe hand drawn water color graphics and the top notch soundtrack set the scene for cleverly written, rhyming, dialog.\n\nI will most certainly finish the game, and would even consider playing again if this fps issue is ever fixed.","November 3, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The beginning is a little annoying when you are getting used to the controls and the timing (everything seems to move in slow motion due to "dream world") but after a while its no problem. There are a ton of really awesome mechanics that make the game more fun and not a run of the mill turn based game. Combat has a timing element, with a window for "casting" (basically when your preparing your attack) and you can interupt enemies while they are casting which essentially skips them. You can slow down your enemies with your firefly companion so you can skip ahead of them. There are also attack types like in pokemon with light being strong against dark, water against fire, etc. that adds to the mix. Overall, for the price, I would say this game is really good. Something that gets old is the constant rhyming in dialogue, but thats just my opinion. It does not ruin the game, it just gets on my nerves. I would say the depth of story and the cool mechanics more than compensates for annoying dialogue.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartless_jack/recommended/256290/","heartless_jack","</3 Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartless_jack/","129 products in account","Child of Light is a family-friendly game that is written all in rhyme, designed to be played as 2-players side by side (so parents, maybe this is how you enjoy games with your kids rather than shooing them from the room so you can play Saint's Row - or worse, letting them stay in the room with you and play all your M-rated titles)\n\nAt best, CoL is a beautiful combination of painting and poetry, which can teach young players some basic platforming and turn-based RPG elements, with a competent adult actually doing the playing, the little player 2 can enjoy the narrative and do a few things that are much needed, once they are shown the way.\n\nAs an adult, playing it by yourself, will you enjoy it as much? Well, probably not, which isn't to say it's a bad game, after all, you will be able to see how much work has gone into making this game, and while it may be simple, well that's all the more credit to it, it's a smart design and it doesn't overcomplicate things.\n\nJust, do not, I repeat, do not, under any circumstances, buy oculi. I bought the entire bundle of them along with all the other micro-transacion DLC, but without really knowing why. I guess it's just something we're used to seeing from AAA game devs, and we've been letting them get away with it. (I bought the game and DLC on sale though, otherwise I wouldn't have had even a passing interest in this based on other peoples' reviews that all gripe about Uplay.)\n\nSo what are oculi, then? Well, they are gems, that go into sockets on your weapons and armor, each having a small stat benefit, and they are craftable within 3 tiers. They drop in the game as well, so if you don't buy them, don't worry, you get them included in the game already, and for the price of a couple dollars for 3-4 of them, really, you can't let yourself get ripped off like that. It's not like you have to seek out the hardest difficulty setting, there is a casual mode, and really, that's the only way I think it should be played, so you can enjoy it for what it is, and put the evil "Corporate Commander" EA / Ubisoft, out of your mind.\n\n\nPros:\n- Painted beautiful artifacts in the game, back to front\n- Simple, but logical puzzles and turn-based RPG combat\n- Gem crafting is straightforward (It's a good thing to have in the game, not a good thing to be nickle and dimed to death over)\n- The game's entirely written in poem, so while cheesy, it can produce entertainment\n\nCons:\n- The Golem and other DLC are BEYOND DOUBT content that was supposed to already be in the game, but was gouged out to make more DLC microtransactions\n- Uplay can be invasive, especially if you don't have a bunch of Ubisoft games (I don't) and CoL will not launch from steam, so Uplay has to be running and you have to have an account\n- Some people reported bugs and lost save data from Uplay, I have not as yet had it happen to me.\n\nFinal Verdict\n7/10 - The gameplay is solid, if simple. The creators of the game put a lot of time, effort and talent into producing this game, it's just such a shame that their work is tainted by the greedy actions of corporate cronies pulling at our pursestrings.\n\n\nTL:DR\nChild of Light good, Ubisoft bad.","May 2, 2015","true","16.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

She also meets several allies along the way, including Rubella, Finn, Norah, Robert, Tristis and etc. With their help she will face her darkest fears.\nThe game has unique, watercolor-esque world created in Ubisoft's UbiArt Framework engine, therefore it will include a variety of platforming elements and puzzles.\nChild of Light is considered as a playable poem.

Unfortunately, the story is a bit too...plain?  You could argue that it was intended for a younger audience, but even then...the writers underestimate children's ability to understand more "mature" subject matter.  The result is a story that feels diluted, compared to the richness of the visuals.\n\nGameplay starts off very slow & simple.  But once you get a couple chapters in, it picks up nicely.  The combat system is similar to Final Fantasy, but with two key twists thrown in.  First, if you attack a monster while it's in the red "Cast" portion of its timeline, you can interrupt it, setting it back to an earlier position.  And second, you (or a friend) can shine the firefly companion's light on one enemy to slow it down.  These two simple elements allow for a surprising amount of strategy, making it possible to chain-interrupt enemies rather than relying on passive defense.\n\nOver all, I'm having fun, and it's a nice change of pace from the many overly-shiny 3D games out there now.

If you are just looking for a light rpg experience with platform elements with beautiful gfx, certainly this game is for you. Otherwise for deep turn based mechanics rpg, better look elsewhere ***\n\nI would like to give thumbs up for Child of Light, also because I was really looking forward to play it.\nBut as big turn-based rpgs fan, I really can't upvote it.\nBefore I get flamed for my negative reviews: the game itself is not that bad, the graphic is just so amazing, the soundtrack beuatiful and enchanting. The story was also good enough so far.\nBut if after 6 hours I don't feel any kind of addiction of going on, something is wrong.\nAnd the problems are the mechanics. The platform elements are ok, but the turn-based ones are definitely not enough and too much repetitive. I am playing in "expert" mode and everything got after 2-3 hours too boring and repetitive. I've nothing abount grinding (thing that is not really required in this game) when the story keeps pushing you to continue because you want to know more, but this is not the case - too long intervals between exploration and story continues. I never used an item except on the third boss (and I was plenty of pots). The creatures are too similar and predictable (weakness to element). And party of 2 persons (even if you can switch them) is  limiting too much the field choices. So far the only thing I did was casting a spell, melee attack with the other, and replace with healer as needed.\nI'm very sorry but I am going to abandon it for now. It's really a shame and an hard decision because the graphic is such a pleasure for the eyes.

Steam already exists.\n2. Uplay is chewing up more than 0% of my resources.\n3. There is no way to bypass Uplay to simply launch Child of Light.\n4. Uplay pop-ups.\n5. Steam ALREADY EXISTS AND HAS ACHIEVED MARKET SATURATION.\n\nPlease - if any part of Ubisoft is reading this, add it to the pile, we hate Uplay! We hate uplay, even the people who love your games (and I really enjoyed what I played of child of light!) hate uplay. Stop foisting it on people in an attempt to replicate valve - you will never replicate valve, as evidence by the fact that I am writing this review on steam, and so have many others.\n\n\nThe game itself\n\nNot without its flaws, the rhyming gets a bit repetitive, and the combat feels shallow in certain ways (repetitive abilities, recycled enemy art) yet is satisfying and the story and environment are delightful. I really enjoyed how it fused a fairy tale style with JRPG mechanics and was intrigued to see how it concluded. If you enjoy JRPGs, and like what you've seen from the screenshots and video I would hazard a purchase, just make sure you have an hour set aside to try it out in case you need a refund.\n\nI honestly would have happily finished this game, but every single time I went to play it, Uplay functioned as some sort of harassing butler that kept jabbering at me about sales and uplay points or some such nonsense. I'd give the games a thumbs up - but the shrieking visage of Uplay  is now linked to it via pavlovian response, so I give the two of them a thumbs down. If Uplay finally dies a death I will return to this game and edit my review.","September 15, 2015","false","3.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's killing the game for me - I'm actively avoiding it as much as I can but sooner or later you have to do it and it's just so BORING.\n\nEnemies have no health bars so you've little idea what's going on without staring at flying damage numbers/messages to judge efficacy.  The timing system gets truly unfollowable once there are multiple players on either side and specials etc. are scarce and often ineffective.\n\nWorst thing is it just doesn't fit the rest of the game at all - it's a curiously static and lifeless thing in a game otherwise packed with joy and sparkle.\n\nEverything else is fine - story, graphics, sound, controls are work well  (the rhyming gets a bit grating but you can skip it without losing the jist of what's going on) but the combat isn't easily avoided - you'll probably spend more time doing it than anything else - and it really is tiresome.\n\nMaybe play it on easy to get the atmosphere and story and then move along eh?\n\np.s.

It looked pretty cool so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Well, the background artwork is quite nice, for sure, but the design and animation of the characters feels a bit sloppy (though I do like the flowing hair).  Besides that, I don't have much to complain about what it looks like.  The game itself, however, is not very interesting.  Even the puzzles are simple and somewhat repetitive, involving lighting up different objects in a pattern.  While flying around and collecting treasure and potions I forget to use can be mildly entertaining, the battles are a disappointment.  It works kind of like turn based strategy of sorts, where you can use your glowing firefly to slow down the opponents.  In other words, battles are about timing and luck.  Even though you get different characters and can work strategies out with the different styles, the main problem is that it is boring.  It is the same type of battle over and over and over again.  Fly around, fight new monsters, fly around, fight more monsters.  Also, I would have liked it if at least three characters could be placed in the battle at a time like the enemies are.  I want to like the game, but I really just can’t.  The fights are pretty long and simply a lot of repetition of trying to blast enemies with your most powerful spell while attempting to avoid becoming paralyzed.  It can take forever.  Lastly, this is more of a personal preference, but I did not like the dialog between characters that shows up quite often.  It does not add to the plot and the poetry feels hastily thrown together to find something, anything that rhymes.  It gets annoying, especially when a new character joins the team and then every single other character must introduce themselves to that one.  Overall, I think the game could have been much better if there were a few tweaks made to it, but as it stands, I’m not very impressed.

Excuse the caps, but I thought it might ask for a bit of attention amongst the floods of positive reviews. The combat in this game is extremely repetitious, and very limited in terms of play styles. Despite having many characters available, you are only able to fight with two at any given time. The skills and simple trees are relatively uninspired, or should I say, extremely inspired by what has frequently been used in past RPG's. The visuals -while aesthetically o.k- really don't go far enough considering the financial backing of ubisoft. Using items/healing/skilling up is tedious with a non-user friendly one at a time character view, and the whole craft your own gems (which add stats/buffs) is equally as limited. You end up making the same ~5 gems over and over again but in higher concentrations (and stat bonuses). This game will pleasantly waste some of your hours, but it is probably not worth the asking price. That being said, it may be a more enjoyable game for a very young audience.

It's very dull gameplay and almost cringeworthy dedication to making up rhymes for every single line of dialogue, which not only breaks the immersion but also makes me roll my eyes way too hard, makes it a very mediacore experience.\n\nI could ignore the terrible idea of rhyming if the gameplay made up for it, but neither the exploration of the world, which is reduced to some simple puzzles and really dodgy 'platforming' (more like dodging obstacles in air really), nor the RPG-esque fighting really qualify this game as 'fun'.\n\nThe fights drag on for longer than necessary and even the 'weaknesses' become meaningless: you attack a fire looking monster so you equip oculi for water attack and fire defence. But you realize when you enter a fight that it also has an earth and air buddy.\nAlso the game plain lies to you - defending is supposed to prevent you from being interrupted the game says, and then happily introduces enemies who ignore defence and knock you back despite defending. At the same time the AI is pretty dumb, often not 'finishing off' characters with low health and instead going for the full health party member, which means you can't really leave low HP people as decoy either.\n\nSo the gameplay is dull, how about the story?\n\nThe characters are varied sure but it's easy to see more effort went into finding rhymes than into actually making the characters memorable. I can berely say anything about the people in my party and it seems like they talk a lot - yet except for terrible rhymes the dialogues contain little to none information. It takes a lot of talent to convey a story through rhymes and the writer here just plain failed in most cases.\n\nAlso you can tell how desperate he or she was for rhyming when a child uses words like 'commerce'. Aurora uses words that don't fit into child's mouth. So yes, rhymes make the game lose the immersion factor.\n\nOverall it's a pretty looking experiment of a game that failed in delivering whatever it was they tried to do.","May 1, 2014","false","6.1"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

It's not for everyone but I was rather fond of it. It made the game feel like a fairy tale come alive.\n\nThe exploration of the world is fun and exciting, the first level of the game sets you up for what to expect throughout the rest of the world, and I have to say, it's never disappointing. Treasure hunting rarely feels like a chore and the ways to obtain certain treasure feels refreshing and uncomplicated.\n\nIn terms of combat Child of Light takes a page from the classic rpg format of turn based fighting and adds several implements. This makes the turn based fighting immersive and exciting and with the allies you come across you will find many unique and interesting ways to topple the competition. There is also a gearing system involving gem stones, I've barely scratched the surface on this and I gotta say, the upgrades you choose through this system really play a part in combat.\n\nMy only real gripe with child of light is how short the game feels. When the game comes to the end you feel like you could've used more time to grind your allies and discovered more quests/treasure. I guess I'll check out the dlc and story plus and see if that doesn't change my mind.\n\nChild of Light is a must play for RPG and fantasy enthusiasts.","December 15, 2014","true","20.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is also very fun and it's battle system shares the ATB(Active Time Battle) system in numerous Final Fantasy games, but adds it's own special touch keeping the things fresh on every enemy encounter.

In other words, if you truly seek a gorgeous adventure, full with epic hand-drawn scenarios and original and well-developed characters, and games like Final Fantasy, don't hesitate to buy this masterpiece and fall into the world of Lemuria, you will not regret it, or if you prefer playing a role against the Russians in a half-♥♥♥♥♥ campaign, be my guest.\n\n9/10","May 2, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I never use the service before, and I didn't expect to like it, but it was worst that I anticipated. Couldn't create my account directly from the software it installed, I had to do it on the web. It took a while before uPlay recognize the account created on the web, download speed were atrocious for the update, it forced subscribe me to some junk (when you open your account on the web only). All that for an added layer of useless DRM that only penalize those that pay for their game with no added benefice, and at a security loss (my game can now be accessed through Uplay, that doesn't require a second security layer like Steam does). Please, just let me play my game and I will greatly reconsider buying a game on Uplay.\n\nIf you jump through all the loop, this is a really nice artistic game that go out of beaten path to bring a fresh new experience to players. Might not be for everyone, but like every seconds I played so far. Graphism are amazing, music is fantanstic, all the sound of the game are just majestic, and gameplay is easy to learn yet rewarding (on hardmode). I've played this game solo and with my son, and it was definitely worth my money (if you can deal cope with stupid Uplay).\n\nEDIT: Once you get Uplay working, it's not that bad and you get into the game without noticing it... Unless it need to update itself. Then it break the BPM, force you to take out your mouse and keyboard to deal with it. Might not be a big issu if you play on a desktop computer, but in a Home Theater, it bothers me. Might be not much, but again, why again do I gain for coping with this ?

You have to be more tactical with the timeline, and interupting opponents. Some dark creatures are vulnurable against specific types of attacks, use that.

Easy to move around at a decent rate, especially once you unlock the ability to fly (which is fairly early on). All text within this game is in some form of poem, usually a rhyme. This game involves a little problem solving, many secret areas  and a ton of fun. The game uses powerful stones called Oculi to provide aditional effects to a characters health, defense and offense which are customisable for all party members at any time except during battle and cutscenes. There are eleven different oculi with their own individual effect depending on where they are applied; nine of which have four tiers of power at varying levels. (Eren's Stone can only be accessed through the purchase of a DLC and the Princess Stone is the most powerful of all and can be crafted with a Brilliant (tier 4) Diamond, Onyx and Spinel.) There are about 52 individual crafting recipies (most are repetitive among different tiers of oculi). One can also acquire and use Stardusts for permanent effects to a character's statistics. Local co-op and controller support.\n\nCombat:\nCombat is turn-based... with a twist. It involves a timeline. Depending on the character's speed, they move down the timeline at different rates (this can be effected by spells, potions or Igniculus - her first companion, controlled by mouse if you are using a keyboard; also known as 'Sir Firefly'). Upon reaching the begining of the casting region near the end, a spell, potion, defense or attack can be chosen (or you can switch party members) with a length of either instant, short, medium, long or very long casting time; which is cast if the character reaches the end of the timeline without being interrupted. Although it is fairly easy to guess based on the colour of the enemy: it doesn't actually tell you what you are fighting nor what element it is. Fire(red) magic/creatures are weak to Water(blue); Water to Lightning(green); Lightning to Fire; and Dark(Varies - usually black, occasionally white) to Light. Fairly easy to level up the same old classic RPG style with several different skill trees for each party member all leading to different  or more powerful abilities.\n\nStoryline:\nAlthough the storyline is good, it's not particulary in-depth. There are many mysterious clues that are seemingly never properly explained. It's a very straight storyline, with no user input and nothing to do after the game is completed. There are several sidequests, most very short and easy to do that lead to extra treasure. To be entirely honest though; although I like the freedom of choice, this game has been made with such precision and care that I don't even mind.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game. It has become one of my all-time-favourites. Sadly, I have finished it now however I enjoyed it so much that I will likely return to play it again several times over in the following years. Personally, the biggest disappointment for me is that there are no Steam cards, badges, achievements, emoticons or really awesome artwork that I can use as my Steam profile background (the latter being my biggest grievance).\n\n"Beware the night, Child of Light."","July 16, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And what a beautiful game it is. The graphics are very pretty in the watercolour and ink style. It is not very complicated, but beautiful. The storyline starts quite sad, but on the road the story gets a bit brighter. The sidequests are fun to do as well, the same goes for finding collectables. Another thing what I liked that everything is writing in a verse-style. It fits the artstyle and story a lot.\n\nThe combat is very interesting. You have to be more tactical with the timeline, and interupting opponents. Some dark creatures are vulnurable against specific types of attacks, use that. Other companions in your party, can cast buffs, debuffs or can even heal. You can also spend skill points to make your party stronger/better. You can also use oculli in their equipment with the same reason.\n\nSo overall, I really like the game. It is not a superlong game, but it is very amusing and enjoyable.\n\nMy rating for the game: 8/10","July 10, 2014","true","27.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OliverGriffin/recommended/256290/","OliverGriffin","OliverGriffin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OliverGriffin/","68 products in account",""Child - tuck yourself in bed.\nLet me tell a story of Lemuria,\nThe kingdom past,\nAnd a girl born for glory."\n\nIf you aren't instantly captivated by the truely beautiful watercolour artwork; the wonderful, peaceful background music; or the soft motherly voice that narrates cutscenes throughout the game in just the trailer - then the carefully crafted and moving storyline behind a young princesss, Aurora, as she tries to reclaim her kingdom of Lemuria and return home to save her people from a disastrous flood certainly will.\n\nGameplay:\nTwo dimensional platformer with stunning parallax graphics. Easy to move around at a decent rate, especially once you unlock the ability to fly (which is fairly early on). All text within this game is in some form of poem, usually a rhyme. This game involves a little problem solving, many secret areas  and a ton of fun. The game uses powerful stones called Oculi to provide aditional effects to a characters health, defense and offense which are customisable for all party members at any time except during battle and cutscenes. There are eleven different oculi with their own individual effect depending on where they are applied; nine of which have four tiers of power at varying levels. (Eren's Stone can only be accessed through the purchase of a DLC and the Princess Stone is the most powerful of all and can be crafted with a Brilliant (tier 4) Diamond, Onyx and Spinel.) There are about 52 individual crafting recipies (most are repetitive among different tiers of oculi). One can also acquire and use Stardusts for permanent effects to a character's statistics. Local co-op and controller support.\n\nCombat:\nCombat is turn-based... with a twist. It involves a timeline. Depending on the character's speed, they move down the timeline at different rates (this can be effected by spells, potions or Igniculus - her first companion, controlled by mouse if you are using a keyboard; also known as 'Sir Firefly'). Upon reaching the begining of the casting region near the end, a spell, potion, defense or attack can be chosen (or you can switch party members) with a length of either instant, short, medium, long or very long casting time; which is cast if the character reaches the end of the timeline without being interrupted. Although it is fairly easy to guess based on the colour of the enemy: it doesn't actually tell you what you are fighting nor what element it is. Fire(red) magic/creatures are weak to Water(blue); Water to Lightning(green); Lightning to Fire; and Dark(Varies - usually black, occasionally white) to Light. Fairly easy to level up the same old classic RPG style with several different skill trees for each party member all leading to different  or more powerful abilities.\n\nStoryline:\nAlthough the storyline is good, it's not particulary in-depth. There are many mysterious clues that are seemingly never properly explained. It's a very straight storyline, with no user input and nothing to do after the game is completed. There are several sidequests, most very short and easy to do that lead to extra treasure. To be entirely honest though; although I like the freedom of choice, this game has been made with such precision and care that I don't even mind.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game. It has become one of my all-time-favourites. Sadly, I have finished it now however I enjoyed it so much that I will likely return to play it again several times over in the following years. Personally, the biggest disappointment for me is that there are no Steam cards, badges, achievements, emoticons or really awesome artwork that I can use as my Steam profile background (the latter being my biggest grievance).\n\n"Beware the night, Child of Light."","July 16, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Falled into a fantasy world, she lives an adventure to save her family and her people, and she also discovers her own marvellous destiny.\n\nThe visual design reminds of old child book illustrations; it is beautiful, although sometimes silly and mushy (...why girls' hair are always horizontal, moved by an omnipresent wind lol?) ...the story and the character design (thanks to the quests she takes, Aurora meets many original characters) are well conceived, also some unexpected plot twists are present.\nRpg features are reduced to quests and characters modification via trees of abilities, but do not expect visible customization or complex character study: you may choose random evolutions and they will equally functions.\nThe turn-based combat system with the action timeline is generally easy, but also smart and it requires a good amount of reasoning and resources management.\n\nA positive note about the music, that will remain in your mind.\n\nAnother curios aspect of the game are the dialogues and narration... all of them are in rhymes. That's cute but... at least in the italian version, no metrics are provided by the authors; for this reason, some sentences just sound contrived and stupid. Such as... not fairy/inspiring characters, but childish idiots who force their own speaking to put rhymes in it at any cost.\nThe idea is cool Ubisoft, but if this is the goal... next time, please hire an experienced poet!\n\nvote 7.5/10","August 7, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I usually lose interest eventually and don't finish.  This one has that perfect balance to where it kept me entertained and interested enough to continue playing, but didn't make me dedicate too much as far as time and patience.  I recommend it for gamers like myself who prefer less depth on occasion for the sake of being able to jump in and play it for an hour or two after work.

I should also say that Uplay is not a big deal in any shape or form.  I see a lot of people freaking out over it, but they're just being dramatic pansies.  In the 24 hours it took me to beat this, I saw the Uplay screen a total of about 60 seconds. It never once interfered with anything at all.  Also, if it prevents piracy, I'm all for it.

I found the difficultly to be good. You can get multiple party members which you can switch out in combat. All enemies have a weakness to an element (light, lightening, fire, etc). There is a timeline at the bottom of the screen which determines whos turn it is, you can slow enemies down or even paralyze them from reaching their turn and they can do the same to you.\n\nStory:\nThe story is quite simple and is told in rhymes. Not everyone will like this. I personally liked it, it made me feel like I was listening to a bedtime story or a fairy tale. Don't expect a deep story or a heavy impact and don't expect any deep character development. Like I said the story is simple.\n\nAudio:\nSimply lovely, especially when Aurora plays her flute.

The art has a lovely watercolor look that adds to the fairytale feel. The music is really well done, too - evocative, supporting but never overpowering the action. However, the story is short and to reiterate, it is a  fairytale  , so if you want an epic campaign to save the world, this isn't it. This is a story about a child growing up, learning to become a leader, how to deal with loss and betrayal, and how to be everything she needs to be - strong, caring, gentle, noble, and powerful.\n\nOne of the strongest points of Child of Light is the combat system - there are about four to six things you have to keep track of simultaneously, and it gets crazy. The real-time turn-based combat was immensely fun - you can only battle with two of your party members at a time, and often the enemy has three combatants that attack at different moments and at different speeds. Learning to control the firefly and shift your party members in and out of the fight in order to combo-stunlock the enemy is a wonderful challenge that really never gets old.\n\nI really enjoyed the diversity of characters here. They come in all shapes and ages and sizes, and all the characters become strong, with their own motivations and stories. In one case, it's a girl being strong for her depressed brother. In another, it's an orphan out for vengeance on the people who killed her parents. There's a mage out to prove himself to his elders. A disgraced warrior out to restore his honor. A boy who wants to win a fair lady's heart. Major points for not sexualizing the female characters, especially as two of them are about 7-10 years old.\n\nYou can't customize your characters' weapons/armor. You can change the stones attached (called Oculi in the game) to add different stats, but you have the same weapons throughout the game and there are no shops and there is no currency. The Oculi are pretty strong - there's the usual RPG combining and there are other stat boosts in the game, but overall customization stays relatively simple.\n\nPerhaps the weakest part of the game is the dialogue - I personally liked it most of the time, but I agree with other reviewers that sometimes clarity is sacrificed for the sake of rhyme. If you hate Shakespeare and can't stand poetry, this game is not for you. The rhyming dialogue gives a sometimes immersive, other times jarring feel - when it works, it's hilarious. When it doesn't, it's just plain bad.\n\ntl;dr:\nPros: beautiful art & music, great combat system, short and fairly casual storyline, wonderful cast of characters\nCons: dialogue is hot or cold, game is relatively short, limited customization","December 5, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Looking forward to sequels/ more games like this.\nPros: gorgeous and unique art direction (the environmental art is absolutely breathtaking and I'm really into the water colour style), lovely fairytale-ish story telling, I love the rhyming dialogues but apparently a lot find it annoying, lots of enemies and bosses. SImple, straightforward fighting. The characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses and are very memorable. The soundtrack is so beautiful and fits the dreamy vibe of the game really well.\nCons: it's a bit too short for me (10 chapters). If you only play to get to the end without exploring then maybe around 10 hours, if you spend time exploring everything and finding all the confessions/ coffers/ stardusts then 20 hours? Game gets really easy once you've gotten the hang of it. I'm currently in ng+ but it's not as challenging as I expected. The ending is a bit rushed. Ng+ is pretty neat since it lets you play against harder enemies and keep all your stuff (except stardusts) but I kinda expected more than that. Maybe some extra areas or bosses would be nice.\nOverall it's a really special game. If you're into artsy RPG with a poignant, fairytale-ish plot then this is definitely for you.

The music is a masterpiece, the gameplay is refreshing, the characters are interesting, the story is well written, the art is fantastic, and the difficulty curve perfectly keeps the game challenging but fair once you get used to the game mechanics. If a game ever truly deserves a 10/10 score, this would probably be it.\n\nOf course, this isn't truely an indie game, as Ubisoft is the one releasing it. In fact, every single negative of the game I can think of (with the exception of the game being somewhat short for an RPG with little replay value) is related to this. The equipment cash-grab DLC (seriously - don't buy those), Uplay, the terrible achievement system, and an unnecessary two-player oriented mechanic are all things that drag down the game. All in all though, if you can live with Uplay and like RPGs, this game is a must play.","December 24, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Outside of combat is standard 2D rpg format that works well with the flight mechanics. Animations, espcially Aurora's, are very nice and well done. Each characters has there own skill tree that has some customization, but not very complicated.\n\n\nControls:\n\nI used a keyboard & Mouse.  Controls were simple and easy to use. In battle they are simplified to an active battle system which is easy to navigate. Outside of combat is a very simplistic platformer that does not require much precision. To Control your firefly you use your mouse, this is designed for a mouse, it works very well. With all that said, I believe the standard controls would also work very well with a control & the firefly mechanic would work well with the second joystick on all controllers. Overall- Very Good.\n\nSound:\n\nBeautiful music that fits the mood all the time, and sound effects fit extremly well with all the Spell effects\n\nGraphics:\n\nAtmospheres are beautifully designed, some of them are downright stunning, from dark & scary forests to Lava filled Trees to underwater caves from beginning to end. Not hard to see what ubisoft focused on while creating this game.\n\nWothey Notes:\n\nThe writing is pretty atrocious, the rhymes seemed very forced and weren't thought to hard about, character deveolpment is lack luster as well but you get the basic points . Only really complaint about this 12 hour RPG. Well worth the money, 8.0 out of 10.\n\n","December 16, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Just hear it\nStory 9/10               Nice . Simple fairy tale but that is the beauty of it\nCharacters 9/10      Nice . Every NPC has flaws , motivation and they are different persons with no stereotypes\nCombat 7/10           Good but can be boring fast\nReplayability 2/10  Unless you enjoy the game so much ,if you play it once and do all the quests or gather all confessions                                       .                                there is little reason to play it again\n\nOverall 9/10             A piece of art .\n\nLong version\n\nI saw this game when it first came out , and i said oh well lets fly the jolly roger. Then after i finished it , i just went and bought it . My experience was so good and felt those weird thingies called emotions that actually i shed a tear (meaning i had to literally wipe my eyes.. those onion-cutting ninjas). The selling points of this game are the atmosphere and the plot. But i will explain all of it below\n\nChild of Light is tagged as a RPG , but offers you no choices in the plot element. But (and it is a big but) offers character customization (talents and occuli) and the most important thing character development . For me RPGs should be like that. You see as the time passes that Aurora and her companions grow up emotionally and stand up to the task .\n\nAtmosphereThe thing that made me play this game was the atmosphere . Graphics , dialogues , music are all so immersive that after 12 hours of playing i realized it was morning and i should tuck myself in bed and let the game and complete it later.\n\nGraphics arent realistic . Instead they follow a fantasy and are dreamlike , but that doesnt stop them for being stunning and once in a while you stop to enjoy the view .\nMusic is a nice background which not only doesnt bother you but you like to hear it .. i cant find the words how well the soundtrack accompanies the game.\nDialogues are in verse , meaning they are poems. They are fun , yet you understand the characters and their motivations and you want to help em .  I always like the dialogeus and read them through but at times speaking in verse can be overwhelming .\n\nBefore  saying anything about the story i must say that this is a game which a child of 8 years can play . There is no blood , no cursing , a little jump scaring (you can always scout with the firefly) , and a simple plot(thougt simple doesnt mean not beautiful)\nStory . You are a princess of Austria and somehow you wake up in the middle of a dark scary forest away from your papa . Also you mist find the moon and the stars and defeat the evil queen umbra. How the hell a little child will do this ? . Of course with the help of the forest lady , Indignicus , and your companions ! each one has his/her own story and motivation and flaws . As the game goes on Aurora will grow up (changing her model) and finally will be an adult. Aurora is not either a warrior or a wizard... she is just a princess ... how you play is up to you. And that is another thing i love about this game.\n\nPlaystyle Combat Well things are simple... you see the timebar , you see when everyone is going to take action and how fast they are gonna do it. Every character ( Aurora included) has strenghs and weaknesses , same goes for enemies. You can change chars by swapping them in battle. You dont get punished for changing a character . After a while you can indentify the enemies and know what to do . What should be mentioned is that you can avoid all battles except bosses . Also you can run from them.\nExploring Go see the screenshots . you fly up and high and the wind brushes your hair and you are free. You are almost always airbound (at least i did it) , and everything is within reach either by you or the shiny blue ball.\n\nOverall if you like fairy tales this game is just for you . Even if you dont, i think you can find a place in your heart for Lemuria and Aurora . This game is a piece or art in which you can actually play . the only bad thing i find is that the game is short and has little to no replay value .","December 20, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a platformer/puzzle/turn-based RPG game in which all three would fall in the "casual" category. The music, art, gameplay was all very good. Nothing about this game was complicated and the battle system was not intricate.\n\nYour gear was combining/upgrading gems that give different abilities or effects and it can be unequipped or changed without penalty. A lot of party members, to choose from but you can only use 2 at a time. You can switch them mid battle without penalty or losing a turn incase one is about to get knocked out. Each character has their own pro/cons. Other than that, it is a stright forward turned based battle system with a bar that lets you know who might be going next (stronger abilites take longer time to get ready).\n\nSome things in the story was never explained (i.e. *Spoiler Alert* *Spoiler Alert* the flooding I assumed was caused by the main villain, but it never stopped even after her defeat).\n\nThe "confessions" which are hidden notes you find that pieces together a story was never explained. I have no idea who those people are that is mentioned in the confessions or what significane they play in the game at all. (None i guess since I beat the game and still don't know who they were.)\n\nThe ending of the game seemed very rushed and a little online research suggests content was removed before release. *Spoiler Alert**Spoiler Alert* After I got my ♥♥♥ whooped and was revived and powered up I was excited to go through another dungeon etc etc fight the villain etc, but nothing. ♥♥♥ whooped - power up cut-scene and final boss. The end.\n\nI did enjoy the overall game though despite that end.\n\n--------------\ntl;dr\nI estimated i spent $4.50 for this game.\nLight-hearted platformer, puzzle and rpg game with some exploring.\nGreat visuals, music, story (for the most part).\nStraight forward turn based combat system.\nLots of party members but only 2 can be active at a time.\nA few things never explained and show no connection with the game story.\n\nRating 7.5/10 (+2 Story, +1Music, +2 Price, +1 Visuals, +1 Smooth Controlling, +2 Overall good game, -0.5 noticeably rushed final battle, -1 no connection with notes of "confessions" and the game I was playing besides finding them because they are hidden, and some elements never explained)","December 27, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There is a timeline at the bottom of the screen which determines whos turn it is, you can slow enemies down or even paralyze them from reaching their turn and they can do the same to you.\n\nStory:\nThe story is quite simple and is told in rhymes. Not everyone will like this. I personally liked it, it made me feel like I was listening to a bedtime story or a fairy tale. Don't expect a deep story or a heavy impact and don't expect any deep character development. Like I said the story is simple.\n\nAudio:\nSimply lovely, especially when Aurora plays her flute.

The art has a lovely watercolor look that adds to the fairytale feel. The music is really well done, too - evocative, supporting but never overpowering the action. However, the story is short and to reiterate, it is a  fairytale  , so if you want an epic campaign to save the world, this isn't it. This is a story about a child growing up, learning to become a leader, how to deal with loss and betrayal, and how to be everything she needs to be - strong, caring, gentle, noble, and powerful.\n\nOne of the strongest points of Child of Light is the combat system - there are about four to six things you have to keep track of simultaneously, and it gets crazy. The real-time turn-based combat was immensely fun - you can only battle with two of your party members at a time, and often the enemy has three combatants that attack at different moments and at different speeds. Learning to control the firefly and shift your party members in and out of the fight in order to combo-stunlock the enemy is a wonderful challenge that really never gets old.\n\nI really enjoyed the diversity of characters here. They come in all shapes and ages and sizes, and all the characters become strong, with their own motivations and stories. In one case, it's a girl being strong for her depressed brother. In another, it's an orphan out for vengeance on the people who killed her parents. There's a mage out to prove himself to his elders. A disgraced warrior out to restore his honor. A boy who wants to win a fair lady's heart. Major points for not sexualizing the female characters, especially as two of them are about 7-10 years old.\n\nYou can't customize your characters' weapons/armor. You can change the stones attached (called Oculi in the game) to add different stats, but you have the same weapons throughout the game and there are no shops and there is no currency. The Oculi are pretty strong - there's the usual RPG combining and there are other stat boosts in the game, but overall customization stays relatively simple.\n\nPerhaps the weakest part of the game is the dialogue - I personally liked it most of the time, but I agree with other reviewers that sometimes clarity is sacrificed for the sake of rhyme. If you hate Shakespeare and can't stand poetry, this game is not for you. The rhyming dialogue gives a sometimes immersive, other times jarring feel - when it works, it's hilarious. When it doesn't, it's just plain bad.\n\ntl;dr:\nPros: beautiful art & music, great combat system, short and fairly casual storyline, wonderful cast of characters\nCons: dialogue is hot or cold, game is relatively short, limited customization","December 5, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Looking forward to sequels/ more games like this.\nPros: gorgeous and unique art direction (the environmental art is absolutely breathtaking and I'm really into the water colour style), lovely fairytale-ish story telling, I love the rhyming dialogues but apparently a lot find it annoying, lots of enemies and bosses. SImple, straightforward fighting. The characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses and are very memorable. The soundtrack is so beautiful and fits the dreamy vibe of the game really well.\nCons: it's a bit too short for me (10 chapters). If you only play to get to the end without exploring then maybe around 10 hours, if you spend time exploring everything and finding all the confessions/ coffers/ stardusts then 20 hours? Game gets really easy once you've gotten the hang of it. I'm currently in ng+ but it's not as challenging as I expected. The ending is a bit rushed. Ng+ is pretty neat since it lets you play against harder enemies and keep all your stuff (except stardusts) but I kinda expected more than that. Maybe some extra areas or bosses would be nice.\nOverall it's a really special game. If you're into artsy RPG with a poignant, fairytale-ish plot then this is definitely for you.

It's like an interactive pop-out story book. With all the characters, environments, and creatures as a normal rpg. but i started playing is where it really got good. 1) The characters talk like in ryhme, as if they are write a poem, and i don't know about you, but i love me some poetry. 2) The story is magnificent, its a well thought out and beautifully written masterpiece that pulls you in like a story you would be read to you by a parent as you fall asleep as a child, yet it is dark and intruiging like a story you would read and fall in love with now-a-days. 3) The characters are all dynamic and have their own strengths and faults laid out on the table for you to see. There aren't any characters that are "cookie cut" in my opinion, you connect and feel with all the characters (even some NPC's) even if you dont fight with all of them. and 4) The battle system is amazing! It's a timebar-type battle system THAT YOU CAN MANIPULATE. You use your mouse to slow down enemies or slowly heal allies, and to me adds a whole new level to the word "STRATEGY".\nThe only cons i can see about this game is, 1) having to connect with uplay through steam is weird and a little inconvenient, but doesn't really bother after the inital set-up. and 2) although i do love the battle system, after awhile of fighting the same mobs over and over, it does get kind of tedious. But I mean all you have to do is skip monsters after awhile so it's easily avoidable.\n9.5/10 a great game for people of all ages","May 12, 2014","true","17.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is relaxing and rewarding, and the soundtrack and gorgeous watercolour art style are so captivating that it's really easy to lose yourself for hours in this game!  I find the combat system to be really fun--it's a combination between turn-based and real time combat, and I really didn't think it would be possible to successfully combine those styles.  This game also has co-op gameplay available, if someone is playing with you.  The other player can control the firefly with the mouse (or extra controller on consoles) and help out during combat, exploration and puzzle solving.  I think the co-op would be a lot of fun, but I haven't been able to try that out yet.  I did pick up some DLC for this game after playing it for about 10 hours.  I found myself enjoying it enough to warrant picking up some bonus content, and even with the extras, the price of this game is very reasonable!

I have not made it very far into the game but they do so much to draw you in. The visuals and art design are breathtaking and mesmerizing. Ubi Art did an amazing job with this game  of pulling you in to the dark, mysterious yet beautiful landscape and environment. The music and sound design sends chills up and down my body. From the sound of Aurora's sword hitting an enemy to hearing a giant walk in the distance, you will always find something to be amazed at. The gameplay is very solid as well. Child of Light does a great job of combining RPG elements with little changes that make it both easy-to-understand yet challenging when it needs to be. I am playing on Hard and even simple skirmishes have me thinking about my next move. All in all, the real grab about this game is that it is only $15 at the time of this writing and it was DEFINITELY worth the money. RPG fans will not be disappointed and Adventure fans will find a new and enchanting world to explore with Aurora. I hope to see more amazing products like Child of Light in the future from Ubisoft.

I found it best played with a controller and solid headphones. Don't rush it, explore the world and enjoy. The game's not too difficult and you could beat it round 12 hours (or less).

The watercolor environments remind me of the classic artwork found in old fairytale books.  This is more of a casual feel RPG in that, there isn't a need to rush through anything.  Unlike many other RPGs out there where the hero uncovers a plot of world domination by a dastardly villain, Child of Light doesn't have that feeling of impending doom.  Even the music, beautifully orchestrated (and sometimes feel super epic), doesn't have that urgency to get from point A to point B.\n\nThe highlight of this game, as many people will tell you, is the combat system.  It's almost a throwback to the active time battles as in Final Fantasy VII.  Where the combat commands seem overly simplistic in the beginning, it gets more complex as the hero levels up.  Timing is everything.  Literally.  In later stages of the game, if one isn't careful, enemies might force the player to constantly be on the defense, which will deplete the store of potions.\n\nThe skill up menu also reminds me of the sphere grid a la Final Fantasy X, which was one of my favorite skill up ideas.\n\nAll in all, Child of Light is a gorgeous game and definitely worth a playthrough.  I have to thank my friend for gifting this to me as a birthday present.","May 9, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nice writing, great music, and fantastic artwork.  The fighting is pretty good too and isn't something I've seen exactly done before.  It's turn based, but also relies on speed and the specific action you use on your turn.  That also changes if your opponent jumps in front of you on this meter that shows when you can use an action.  In the fighting scenes though, it's fixed and free flow.  You can still control your little light buddy to slow enemies speed on your cast bar on the bottom and to pick up HP and MP replenishers. There are skill trees which are pretty familiar, except that you kind of start in the middle and branch off in three different directions.

Day of release and a couple hours in I actually found myself recommending it to my friends.\n\nArtstyle-wise: I absolutely loved it. Throughout the entire game I found myself just paused at some of the scenes wondering if I should be taking a screenshot. Dialogue wise there were moments where I found myself chuckling at the humor.\n\nGameplay-wise: I played on hard difficulty which wasn't quite apparent until maybe halfway into the game where counter-interrupts and status effects started plaguing me, but I quickly adapted to using ailment protection so that wasn't too bad. There wasn't much need for grinding so to say, which made the RPG aspect much more enjoyable as I could just plow straight through the story. The combat aspect takes up a majority of the gameplay with a touch of exploration, especially looking for stardusts (permanent power up bonuses). Combat is a lot of fun with a timeline based combat that tells you "who goes next" while still remaining intuitive. The kicker however is the fireflly, where you can use him to slow enemies JUST ENOUGH so that you can interrupt them.\n\nStory-wise: The game gives me a JRPG type of feel which I am completely okay with\n\nOverall: I had an enjoyable time exploring everything.

The first thing you'll notice is the music, oh god, words can't even describe how beatiful the music is, really only the violin will make your skin shiver. And that end credits music. The gameplay is also very fun and it's battle system shares the ATB(Active Time Battle) system in numerous Final Fantasy games, but adds it's own special touch keeping the things fresh on every enemy encounter. In terms of difficulty, if you want somewhat of a reasonable challenge go on Hard, but even Normal keeps you on your toes.\n\nThe level design is absolutely gorgeous and the scenarios are even more breath-taking, so much that you can download wallpaper versions on Uplay via Rewards. The only downside on this game is the linear story, don't get me wrong it's very good but lacks of epic twists that keeps a story fresh and engaging. In other words, if you truly seek a gorgeous adventure, full with epic hand-drawn scenarios and original and well-developed characters, and games like Final Fantasy, don't hesitate to buy this masterpiece and fall into the world of Lemuria, you will not regret it, or if you prefer playing a role against the Russians in a half-♥♥♥♥♥ campaign, be my guest.\n\n9/10","May 2, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I never use the service before, and I didn't expect to like it, but it was worst that I anticipated. Couldn't create my account directly from the software it installed, I had to do it on the web. It took a while before uPlay recognize the account created on the web, download speed were atrocious for the update, it forced subscribe me to some junk (when you open your account on the web only). All that for an added layer of useless DRM that only penalize those that pay for their game with no added benefice, and at a security loss (my game can now be accessed through Uplay, that doesn't require a second security layer like Steam does). Please, just let me play my game and I will greatly reconsider buying a game on Uplay.\n\nIf you jump through all the loop, this is a really nice artistic game that go out of beaten path to bring a fresh new experience to players. Might not be for everyone, but like every seconds I played so far. Graphism are amazing, music is fantanstic, all the sound of the game are just majestic, and gameplay is easy to learn yet rewarding (on hardmode). I've played this game solo and with my son, and it was definitely worth my money (if you can deal cope with stupid Uplay).\n\nEDIT: Once you get Uplay working, it's not that bad and you get into the game without noticing it... Unless it need to update itself. Then it break the BPM, force you to take out your mouse and keyboard to deal with it.

The story is nice, but it isn't very deep. Gameplay -- linear, not open -- is roundly functional and the controls are straightforward and highly intuitive even though the menu-driven inventory system may leave a little something to be desired. The battle system is challenging and paced well, but also a touch formulaic (I suppose that's part of the genre; I have never been an enthusiast of turn-based combat, so perhaps I'm not the one to ask about that).\n\nHere the focus was clearly on art, and it paid off. For the price, it is worth getting this game just to see it. The art style, reminiscent of the fairy tale illustrations of Ivan Bilbin, is astounding in imagination and execution. It is *the prettiest* game I have ever seen, as far as that goes.\n\nThe only major drawback, annoying enough for me almost not to recommend it to the community, is the godforsaken U-Play DRM from Ubisoft which you must be connected to in order to play. I haven't had any technical problems with it, but I hate invasive DRM of that nature, and this feature seems to be the focus of an awful lot of negative reviews.\n\nI do wish the character dialogue were on par with the game art; clearly it is not. The characters speak in rhyming verse, which adds to the storybook flavor of the game, but it is...well...just not very *good* verse. The dialogue isn't bad, so to speak, it just matches neither the tone nor the quality of the art. They hired serious artists to craft the visuals; if they wanted to use poetry, why wouldn't they hire serious poets? I'm sure lots of great poets out there could use the income.\n\nOverall, though, this is a highly enjoyable gaming experience on the lighter side of the RPG niche, and I'd gladly recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of game flavor.

The main quest is lovely, the sidequests give you information that would make you crave more, and the confessions are amazing.

With the help of Igniculus, a character you meet right at the start of the game, you are able to influence the time it will take enemies to act, and if you're clever, you can interrupt an opponent in the middle of an action, potentially eliminating their ability to do anything throughout a battle.

Right away I want to applaud the game developers for creating an interesting co-op mechanic. The main player in solo play could just control the secondary role themselves (in fact they still can while another person is plugged in), if you are able to multitask and be effective it pays off to control the sprite character during hard battles. Giving the second player the role of this sprite splits the responsibility so that you don't have to consider as many options during fights, but you will still want to coordinate with the other player to perfect your timing.\n\nIt's obvious that this game is uniquely beautiful. Ubisoft came up with a graphics engine that does a great job representing the mythical storied universe that the game takes place in. It's like someone added a physics engine to a children's book watercolor drawing.\n\nThe story is told in the form of a poem, which is fun in spirit, but it's not always executed as well as I would have hoped. Otherwise, this is a very solid RPG game with great controller and co-op support.\n\n4/5","May 17, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The princess, Aurora, has died and her papa has lost hope, but with the help of unusual friends there is no time to mope. Aurora battles darkness with friends anew, hoping to see this spiritual adventure through. Magicians, jesters and warriors unite to give the princess one last chance. With each battle won, Aurora makes her advance.\n\nThe attractive world of Lemura is rendered with Ubi-Art Framework, but the lack of noteworthy gameplay starts to hurt. Aurora walks or flies across colorful landscapes, stumbling upon treasures and wishes.  Wishes ignite your friendly orb of light and treasures prevent you sleeping with the fishes. The orb stuns foes left and right, but minimal exploration makes the adventure slight.\n\nAs you collide with foes, you are thrust into a contrived battle pose. Battles have your friends taking turns to eliminate foes counting three. But the nature of the combat propels enjoyment far out to sea. You jostle to deal elemental damage to susceptible foes, yet constant interrupts keep you on your toes. Once you become a master tactician, bosses turn interrupts into a war of attrition. Some bosses succumb after half an hour, making boss battles repetitive and sour. Combat is tolerable at best - how much you can endure is the true test.\n\nJust as the world lacks excitement, the un-voiced dialogue becomes an indictment. Exactly as this review is written before you, the authors were smitten with rhyming too. Some might think it funny or clever, but it becomes like persistent bad weather. If instead you find this readable, then you’ll likely find the narrative tolerable. Know that there is little that proves enlightening, even as you battle forces most frightening.\n\nIf Lemuria is the land we are sent to after death, try to avoid the reaper long after your last breath.

Let me elaborate on this.\nThe number one reason is that the game is a crappy console port. It runs 10 FPS on a high-end PC in full-screen mode.\nThe other major flaw of this game is that you need to have a UPlay account to play it. WHY? Why did Ubisoft even create it? So, you start the game from Steam, that is one client already, and then it logs into UPlay. Brilliant.\n\nAnyway, the game itself would be a pretty easy RPG but the 10 FPS lag makes it unplayable.","October 23, 2015","false","18.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

But I didn’t. The reason that I wanted to love it is that from the very first trailer I saw I was enchanted with the graphical styles of the game. This enchantment lasted well into my first playthrough; well past the point where I tired of some game elements I was still excited just to look at each new part of the world Child of Light laid out for me. Every bit of scenery and every sprite looks hand crafted. Winsome characters and sumptuous backgrounds have the look of ink and watercolor art from some gorgeous, moody storybook.\n\nWoods give way to craggy rocks give way to villages revealing one stunning tableau after another. Broken statues stare poignantly. Light shines through stained glass and down from treetops. Giants are visible in the hazy distance… There is beauty, often mixed with melancholy, everywhere—even the fights are suffused with it. The animation of Aurora, the protagonist, is also arresting. The attention paid to the movement of her long hair alone is worthy of mention, as are the animations of her wielding a sword clearly too heavy for her tiny body.\n\nAll this is true, but my reaction to the game as a whole is more measured. As mentioned, you play as Aurora, an Austrian princess snatched into a fantasy land where she must lead a struggle against the Queen of Dark whose aim is to steal all natural light in the kingdom. You must recruit allies to your party and complete quests to defeat the Queen. Gameply is a mix of metroidvania, side-scroller environments with puzzles, and quasi-turn-based RPG battles. The integration of these two is interesting: encounters are not random. Monsters are visible in the over-world, and how you interact with them there determines who has the initiative at the beginning of a fight. Another interesting mechanic is that your cursor is a character, a glowing sprite, which moves independently of Aurora and interacts with the environment aiding her progress. Mousing over objects is often counted as the sprite interacting with them, so to some degree you are controlling two characters at once. In general, the over world elements of play are quite easy, though.\n\nBattles involve two party members squaring off against a squad of monsters. The action is driven by a timeline, with each character receiving actions at intervals. This differs from a turn-based system in that the intervals vary significantly between combatants, and can be further manipulated by player actions. Character progression, via a branching maze of unlockable nodes ala FF X, unlock new combat abilities. This simple mechanic generates a variety of interesting fights, though by the end of the game I felt the battles were becoming somewhat monotonous, as often happens with turn-based battle mechanics in simple games.\n\nThe game is linier and story-driven. It is here that I had my major complaints. The game creators aimed for a moving coming of age story. (If you have seen it, the Neil Gaiman movie Mirrormask seems to be very much the sort of thing they were aiming for.) But this falls short in a number of ways. One reason is that story scenes are done in a kind of storybook mode with largely static images of the characters acompanied by text. Compared to the rest of the game these sequences are oddly uncharismatic. But a much more major shortcoming is the dialogue itself. The game sets all dialogue in verse. But it seems the writers did not have the skill to make this device actually work for them resulting in bad rhymes and perpetually stilted wording. This verbal lack of poise is oddly at odds with the stunning visual beauty of the game. Perhaps these factors alone are enough to explain my mixed feelings towards the story.\n\nIn the final count Child of light still offers a wondrous world to explore and marvel at, it still casts a spell. It just didn’t quite live up to its potential. I was left feeling that if every aspect of the game showed the beauty and polish that the graphics do then Child of Light would be one of the greats. The gorgeous, well-built, casual RPG Child of Light actually is makes me badly wish I could play that game.","August 14, 2015","true","24.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sadly, that is the case with regards to my experience with Child of Light.\n\nUsing the UbiArt Framework to create a watercolor world of wonder, Child of Light definitely succeeds in being something lovely to look at; indeed, this is what first drew me to the game. The music is very lovely as well (even touching at times) and adds to the child-like, fairy-tale theming of the game and story. However, it is in this fairy-tale presentation that I believe the game makes its biggest misstep: rhyming.\n\nBear with me and allow me to elaborate: I know it seems silly that something so innocuous could mar a good game. When first beginning my journey through Lemuria the rhyming came off as quite charming. The spoken narration for the cut-scenes, all written in rhyme, made it feel like a tale being told to a sleepy-eyed child and was not unwelcome in the slightest. As the game wore on, though, and the repeated reading of rhymes continued (some conversations turning bizarre just to tag a rhyme on the end), I found myself completely apathetic towards Aurora and her friends. Every line of dialogue attempts to rhyme with no consistent rhyming scheme throughout, which resulted in all interactions becoming a sort of poetic muddle, preventing any sort of personalities for the characters to shine through past their singular motivations. It’s possible that if each character spoke in a different rhyming scheme then making all dialogue rhyme in some way or another would have been successful; there’s plenty of great literature written entirely in rhyme. As it stands, though, the inconsistent schemes just make the dialogue a chore to read, as one dialogue set will rhyme one way but the next will buck the previous set’s scheme for something else. Near the game’s end, I found myself avoiding side-quests, ignoring potential new party members, and just trying to get to the game’s conclusion so that I could be done with it.\n\nAll of which is incredibly disappointing because the game is perfectly functional. The combat is a decent, turn-based affair with a few little tweaks to the long-standing formula that provides additional interest and strategy: nothing to write home about but completely adequate. The same can be said of the Oculi crafting system, which allows you to create additional stat-boosting accessories for your party. These coupled with the aforementioned charming visuals and lovely music could have created a perfectly enjoyable experience but without engaging dialogue to breathe personality into the characters, world, and story, these factors all end up becoming window-dressing to an unfortunately bland experience.\n\nI really wanted to like Child of Light, too, but in the end I don’t feel that I can recommend it. For all its charms it ends up feeling without its own voice or personality, which left me feeling regrettably unfulfilled.","May 17","false","14.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

I can't recommend it in good conscience however.\n\nGameplay: The combat feels like a classic JRPG but with some real-time elements that allow you to control a secondary character (or let someone else use the mouse to do so). This guy can collect healing objects for you, or even slow down your enemies on the timeline which is incredibly useful and adds a new dynamic to trying to interrupt your enemies. Overall I enjoyed the classic combat. My one major gripe is that you only ever can have 2 of your party members out at a time, which seems absurd to me. Especially since your enemies routinely have 3.\n\nArt: You can't say enough about the art style. It's got a brilliant storybook feel that is woven throughout the story as well. The color palette and style is bold and refreshing. Animation leaves a lot to be desired however, as they all look more like paper cutouts hanging from strings.\n\nStory/Writing: This is what ruins the game for me. The story is hopelessly childish and unoriginal, which leaves me wondering what the target audience is. I do realize that this matches the visual style, but there must be ways to achieve a story that is appealing to adults while maintaining the whimsical visuals. Things like Trine 2 or Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons did this wonderfully. Overall the story was sickeningly saccharine. In contrast, Brothers started out extremely fanciful, but quick got dark and serious in it's themes. They're both coming-of-age tales, but Brothers pulled it off in a much more brilliant and emotional way (and without words, yet!). In Child of Light, you'll never care about any of the characters. Speaking of words, I must say a few about the poetry. I feel as if the poetry could have saved the hokey story. However, the poetry was dreadful. The writers made no attempt to compose with any meter or rhythm, but instead stuck stubbornly to their A-B-A-B rhyme scheme regardless of the cadence of the sentences. Shakespeare is rolling in his grave. I love great poetry when it has a solid rhythm and bounce to it (See Penny Arcade's Twisp and Catsby stuff!), but this sounded more like a junior high student writing poetry for the first time. Even the rhymes were a stretch from time to time, and left you gagging or saying "oh come on, really?!".\n\nIn conclusion, I give this a "NO" with a very heavy heart. I wanted to like it so bad. There were parts of it I really enjoyed. But I found myself rushing from battle to battle in order to enjoy the combat, while the story left me wanting. I don't mind a good kid's story. But this wasn't just a kid's story, it was downright childish and lame. If you think the beautiful art and great combat can redeem an ignorable story, then maybe give this a try. But for me, it wasn't worth the 10 hours.","July 11, 2014","false","10.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

It reminds me a lot of older stories and fairy tales that i was told as a kid.\nGameplay-wise, this is what you'd get if you crossed an indie developed puzzle-platformer like Limbo, with a game like (the old and good) final fantasy games. The combat feels great and the interupt mechanic is a nice touch.\nThe game's music is understated and adds a great childlike atmosphere to the environment.\nOverall i'd say i'm going to enjoy the rest of the game if it continues along this same path.\nI could comment on the same day DLC, which is obviously a ubisoft cashgrab and takes away a bit of the magic of this game if you think about it too much. So i don't think about it too much!

The trailer looked *amazing* and the reviews looked positive too. I was hoping this would be a beautiful game I could lose myself in. Unfortunately that was not the case.\n\nThe story of the game is about a princess who falls into a dream-world which she must explore and escape. Accordingly, the movements of the character are very dream-like and slow...contrary to the trailer, which showed her moving at a "normal" video game pace. Thus, trying to play this game was almost painful...it's like one of those dreams where you're trying to run but your feet are bogged down like you're trying to swim in a pool full of syrup. Not a pleasant gameplay experience at all.\n\nI still tried to stick it out though, until I got to the combat part. I guess I'm just not used to puzzle-related combat styles in games, but, it just wasn't very fun to try to figure out. If you're used to games like that, then this won't be a problem. But it wasn't enjoyable for me at all.\n\nThe good parts about this game are the music and the graphics. The music is haunting and beautiful, and the graphics are styled to look like a moving watercolor painting you can explore...which is an awesome concept that is stunningly executed in this game. So since that part of the game is so awesome, I really wish the gameplay for this game hadn't been so hard to use. Because if you can't play the game, it doesn't matter how pretty it is to look at and listen to. Unless you just watch playthroughs of it on YouTube. Which is a possibility I guess.","November 28, 2015","false","2.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

As for UPlay itself, I've never had an issue with it, but I know some people have, so if UPlay concerns you, you might want to err on the side of caution.\n\nOverall, I definitely don't regret buying this, and again, for $15, it really is a steal.","May 2, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Some allies are timid and fearful while others are strong, yet outcasted. The story really blends everything together well and made me want keep going just so I could see what would happen next. The art style is beautiful, all the characters are flawlessly designed for the setting they're placed within like paintings on a canvas. A lot went behind this game, and I personally believe it paid off. The story's like a page-turner. Sometimes it gets a little slow, sometimes it speeds through and puts the characters in a terrible perdicament, and there're those moments where it's just right-those moments where you lose sense of that fact that it's a game, it feels more like a work of art (totally not referring to the combat, referring to a scene later in the game.).

I adore the art style, the character designs, and how the environments make it feel like I'm traveling through the pages of a beautifully illustrated fairytale similar to the ones I used to read when I was a child.\n\nThe combat in the game was alright, but I found myself wanting to avoid as much as possible as I progressed. I didn't find it all that fun, probably because I never felt like my character was progressing in any significant way. The skill tree wasn't very exciting (I would always forget to assign points because I didn't care), and using oculi in place of traditional equipment was disappointing, especially when having to switch them around frequently depending on what I was fighting.\n\nMy biggest complaint with Child of Light, however, was the dialogue. I appreciate what they were trying to do, but I found it very difficult to invest myself in the characters or the story because the rhyming made it hard for me to follow what was going on. It was far too distracting, and eventually I stopped trying to decipher the silliness and button mashed through all the talking.\n\nI wanted to love this game and there are things I do love about it. The soundtrack is wonderful, and obviously it's a joy to look at and explore. I just feel that the most important aspects of this game were the ones that let me down the most.\n\nAlso, the Uplay requirement to play is lame.","May 28, 2014","false","9.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WideAndNerdy/recommended/256290/","WideAndNerdy","Wide And Nerdy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WideAndNerdy/","177 products in account","What an enchanting game.\n\nIt feels like a fairy tale with rpg elements. Like a well illustrated children's storybook come to life in video game form. RPG combat system is classic with a few updates. A lot of the tactical element of the game centers around altering how quickly you or your enemies can attack. If you can attack your enemy when their initiative meter gets into the red zone, you can interrupt them potentially setting them back an entire turn. And you have multiple options for affecting that timing.\n\nWhile your attacks are turn based, you have a fairy companion controlled separately by the mouse who can heal you, or slow down your enemies and operates in real time.  Out of combat this same companion can interact with objects on the map that Aurora can't reach in a variety of ways allowing two people to play, one operating Aurora with the keyboard and the other controlling the fairy with the mouse\n\nThe trailers do a pretty good job of letting you know what you're in for and the beauty and grandeur of it all holds up throughout the game. Its proof that you can have a beautiful game without demanding that your video card spit out the maximum number of polygons and photorealistic textures and next gen lighting effects. As shown here, with some actual art direction, you can do so much more with so much less.\n\nThe story is a basic coming of age tale combined with a heroes journey. Young Princess Aurora seemingly dies in bed only to wake up in a strange new land. Able to see haunting visions of her own father falling ill from grief as he mourns her passing, she must explore her new world and try to find her way home while making friends and enemies along the way.\n\nOne annoying thing was the decision to write the game in rhyming couplets.

However, the turn-based RPG combat felt trite and out of place given the rest of the game experience.  It was also disappointing that grinding through these combat encounters was frequently the only means of story progression.  The artistry of the world is no mean feat, but the game play was not particularly unique or innovative and the story lost much of its thematic power through experience grinds and interruptions announcing Uplay unlock/ achievement events.\n\nHad I noticed this required a continuously-connected Uplay account, I simply would not have made the purchase.  I like the game, but I just don't play it because of the hassle involved.  Logging into both Steam and Uplay back to back, and being unable to access a single-player game for which I have already paid whenever the internet is wonky, is absolute rubbish.  I am disappointed that Steam is offering games with this type of DRM and promoting them with sales.","December 30, 2014","false","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Like a well illustrated children's storybook come to life in video game form. RPG combat system is classic with a few updates. A lot of the tactical element of the game centers around altering how quickly you or your enemies can attack. If you can attack your enemy when their initiative meter gets into the red zone, you can interrupt them potentially setting them back an entire turn. And you have multiple options for affecting that timing.\n\nWhile your attacks are turn based, you have a fairy companion controlled separately by the mouse who can heal you, or slow down your enemies and operates in real time.  Out of combat this same companion can interact with objects on the map that Aurora can't reach in a variety of ways allowing two people to play, one operating Aurora with the keyboard and the other controlling the fairy with the mouse\n\nThe trailers do a pretty good job of letting you know what you're in for and the beauty and grandeur of it all holds up throughout the game. Its proof that you can have a beautiful game without demanding that your video card spit out the maximum number of polygons and photorealistic textures and next gen lighting effects. As shown here, with some actual art direction, you can do so much more with so much less.\n\nThe story is a basic coming of age tale combined with a heroes journey. Young Princess Aurora seemingly dies in bed only to wake up in a strange new land.

To answer the question: why all this happened? ...\nHowever, the silence itself finds us through the art of artists and musicians. Good video game, of course, can be considered a real art. After all, it is intended to bring the light of peace and joy, at the same time, it must be clear and accessible.\n\nHonestly, I did not play the last five years. But the "Child of Light" - this is not the case: the music has brought me to this game. I was looking for some compositions in the social network, and suddenly stumbled upon the soundtrack of this unique game.\nI was so carried away by the fabulous world of Lemuria that almost design my own art for this game.\n\nFortunately, many have already written a wide variety of game- play and reviews on the game world. But my heart can not be silent, seeing such beauty as the Child of Light. This music, these poetry, it is the Kingdom of Light ... Excuse me, but then I can not keep silent! Especially when there is a bright catharsis: with every victory in Lemuria the weather changes.\n\nWhat I have ever learned from the Queen of Light? She gave me the meaning of life, as I was looking for it last two years of study at the university. Already I tried to find it with someone 's help. And I found it!\nAfter the final scenes I was definitely clear why to live: I just put myself in the place of Aurora, and Lemuria in place of the world in which I am. "I'm not afraid of the threat of sleep" - as Aurora would told in my place. And I just somehow wilted ...\nCourage, here's what you need to overcome your difficulties in life. It would seem that this conclusion is trivial. But as well as it's beautifully illustrated and you offered to play, with the courage to pass all tests in Lemuria and come out the winner. In the first place, the winner of your fears. And when you see a little girl turns out to be more courageous than you, you want to be at least as she is.\n\nThank you all for your attention\n\n(original: http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/child-of-light/user-reviews?sort-by=date&num_items=100)","October 4, 2014","true","66.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Reasonable amount of content for $15. Fairly strategic turn-based battles for a jRPG-style active combat system (deeper than simply mashing A/X to get through one tedious grind after the next).\n\nIf you're not manly enough to play a fairy tale game about a little girl, then I don't even know what to say to you bro.\n\nP.S.
