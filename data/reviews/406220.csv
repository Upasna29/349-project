Mechanically the game is sound but there is a plethora of small bugs that I'm sure will be resolved before the game is released.\n\nGameplay video of first level\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHeTuZvPG80\nNote: Opening sequence was not laggy at all in game, not sure why screen capture had issues with it.","December 6, 2015","true","2.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game has the feel of a N64 platformer like Mario 64 or or even Conker's. You can tell that the environement design is still being activly developed but the world is already very lush with lots of vegetation that leaves very little edge geometry in view which gives the game a very organic aesthetic. A couple other polished elements I have enjoyed is the cinegraphic quality of the camera and also the soundtrack. The combination of the two keep you engaged and even the sparser environments have a directed feel. I'll be keeping an eye on this game as it's being developed. Excited to play the final product!","October 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I saw this had come out of early access, and im usually hesitant about e.a. but this was cheap and reminded me of SuperMario64 or Zelda64. It plays well, works on my desktop and chromebook (which is amazing) and is great on Linux. I do expect more levels and some more polish in the graphics/texture area however.\n\nStill, it works on a chromebook Intel Celeron 2955U Dual-core 1.40 GHz Perfectly.\n\nIntel CPU Specs:\nGraphics Base Frequency	200 MHz\nGraphics Max Dynamic Frequency	1 GHz\n\n*EDIT: I also appreciate that the Dev is responding to customers here and on reddit. Keep it up!","October 29, 2015","true","5.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","4"

This is what happens when an artist also programs.","December 7, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
