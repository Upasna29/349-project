Traditionally with World War II games, I picked Germany (my homeland) as who I want to play as. Instead of being evil, I hightened my reputation with neighboring countries, gave aid to countries in need, and was just being plain friendly. Then I realized that in order to make best friends with other countries, I needed their same goverment. Since I was trying to be buddies with France, I decided to go for Democracy. The only way I could think of changing my goverment was to declare war on them and immediately ask for peace by changing goverment fourm.\n\nThis was a DISASTER. France chose to decline in a millisecond. Instead of the Nazis blitzkrieging the French, the French blitzkrieged ME. After losing, I was libberated into a COMMUNIST country from the USSR who recently took Poland due to greed. I fell out of my chair laughing now since I had the support of the communists from the East, and the Italians from the South. France fell in 3 turns after I was liberated. Eventually I grew strong enough to fight back the Soviets all the way to Leningrad just like real World War 2, until they demolished me with aircraft.\n\nThe Americans were coming from the West while this happened. I had an amazing defence on the boarder of Germany and France, and when the Allies saw this, the United States of America declared war on the Allies. I was crying by this point. America has ruined the plan for all the Allies to defeat Nazi Germany, and I retook annexed France under my wing.\n\nWhile Americans were fighting British men in Normany (where the American men were suppose to fight the Nazis), I was marching into Moscow with my swastika flag. Eventually I took over Italy, and the rest of my European allies.\n\nI must say; America avoided the Cold war by reenacting the Revolutionary war of 1775-1783 in 1945. 10/10 will play as America next time to create World War III = The United States of America against The United Kingdom against The USSR.","June 13, 2015","true","367.7"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","90","66","73","44","0"

It is not as in depth as concurrence games like Hearts of Iron, but this makes the game very Casual friendly without losing its charme for core players like me.\n\nYou can play as a nation of the given scenario time, by standard between 1936 and 1944 (so around World War II obviously). That obviously includes nations like the Soviet Union, the USA and Nazi Germany, but also stuff like Liberia, Bhutan and Guatemala. Great variety of nations. The weaker a nation is, the harder it gets for the player. (You can also set the difficulty out of 7 different difficulties to make enemy AIs more aggressive and well thinking in battle and allied AIs more cowardly and bad thinking in battle.)\n\nOne of the big upsides of the game is the real in depth Map Editor, that lets you change special properties of the map like the size of army and the exact position of cities, but also basic properties like which region belongs to which nation and creating new cities, resources, nations etc. The only thing negative is that the Editor targets towards more casual players. Changing flags and emblems of nation, as well as the relation and the behavior of AIs is only able to be changed by going into Editor .xml files and changing the codes. It lets you create stuff like WWI or Modern World or completely fantastic scenarios, but you cannot change the Planet itself sadly. Id love to play in the world of Dungeons & Dragons, WarCraft, etc., but sadly it is not given.\n\nThe BIGGEST upside is the Multiplayer of the game. It is really fun, but first off is the community pretty small, so bring some friends to play MP. Also, you mostly need a LAN device to find the servers, Id recommend playing on a LAN party or using Hamachi or better Tunngle (better networks, server and better stabilized).\n\n\nOver all a pretty great game, even though the expansion to the Gold version, as well as the also pretty good second part of the franchise, is missing on Steam.","November 25, 2013","true","275.2"," 44 of 48 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","44","48","0","2"

Diplomacy is simple and combat is relatively easy to learn.\n\nOne thing I will mention though, is that the world market is your best friend. if you play as anyone but the U.S USSR or Germany (I'm not sure about the U.K or China) then you will become dependent to the world market. Surprisingly, the same goes to self-sufficient countries if you want to keep a fairly steady income.\n\nThat's all I'm going to mention about the game because if you download custom scenarios (which I HIGHLY recommend) then the gameplay, research, resource consumption, world market, etc will change depending on the scenario.\n\nFor an example, I downloaded a scenario that let me played as the Holy Roman Empire in 1936, I fought the Nazis, conquered Europe, and fought the USSR and the U.K as a pro-Fascist SuperPower. Yes, Hitler was beaten by Julius Caesar.\n\nI definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get into Grand Strategy games. This is a good place to start with it's cheap price and its simple gameplay mechanics.","January 19, 2015","true","260.4"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","87","33","38","10","7"

Has different campaign starts incase you don't want to spend a lot of time playing.\n- First campaign starts from 1936 and is mostly economic based up until 1939 when the war starts and then ends in 1945. It also involves a lot about the Spanish Civil War and lets you ask, or change/repeat history, whether Republican Spain would win or if Nationalist Spain wins and whether Nationalist Spain joins the Axis beyond political support or if Republican Spain joins the Allies, or vice versa.\n- Second campaign starts shortly before the war, in 1938, showing the rise of Germany and their moves in Czechoslovakia and the Rhineland. Ends in 1945.\n- Third campaign starts at the brink of the war, 1939, with the invasion of Poland and sorrounding countries. Ends in 1945.\n- Fourth campaign starts in 1941 with the entry of America into the war after Pearl Harbor. Ends in 1945. Also involves the invasion of the Soviet Union(Eastern Front). Ends in 1945. Also has the battle in Africa.\n- Last campaign starts in 1944 and involves the invasion of France by the hands America, Britian and Canada(Operation Overlord/D-Day). Also involves the final stages of the Pacific War and the end of the war. Ends in 1945.\n*Has other historically correct events(unless you are the country that would've caused that event, in that case it is your choice if you follow history), such as the civil war in China with Communist China and Nationalist China, economic problems in America, Japan's crazy expansion, etc.\n*Easy way to make your own scenarios.\n*Lets you do what you always wondered and see what happens. Play as Germany and avoid a war with the Soviet's and see if you can conquer all of non-Soviet Europe. See what happens as Japan if you had not declared war on America. See what happens if, as the Soviet's, you make a move against Germany first. SEE WHAT HAPPENS!\n*Area that was formally Allied is given back to the former country when conquered by an Allied army. Ie. Normandy is given back to France after America wins the battle in Normandy.\n*Countries are never defeated until the whole alliance is destroyed.\n*Turn based instead of real time(might be a con for some, but it makes it easier for planning purposes and reviewing mistakes quickly.)\n*Almost no lag.\n*Great mod support/custom scenario sharing support.\n\nCons:\n*Area that is occupied is given to the country that fought first, not the country that contributed to the battle the most.\n*Hard to recover from major losses in an area.\n*No way to have production to reinforce in areas that you conquered back for a country you are Allied. Ie. America can't build stuff in a French factory in a region that they conquered for France.\n\nA very fun game!\n\n8/10 for strategy.\n9/10 for fun.\n10/10 for length.\n7/10 for occupation system/conquering system.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\nCategory:\nFive star+ game!\nGreat game\nDecent game\nBuy on a sale\nNot that bad\nPretty bad\nHorrible, do not buy!","May 12, 2015","true","33.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themrsir/recommended/6250/","themrsir","Mr.Sir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themrsir/","190 products in account","When I first got the game for $1.24 on sale, I was shocked at how good the game actually is.\n\nFor starters, the in game tutorial is relatively good. It teaches the core and advanced concepts of the game, without being too confusing or too long.\n\nYou can play as any nation in the world, and lead your nation towards world domination, without being forced to play the game historically. The AI also doesn't completely act historical either. In one game, the UK declared war on Russia, when Russia invaded Poland.\n\nThe game doesn't end at a specific time, while it does say that it has a set amount of max turns, you can continue on and  play indefinitely.\n\nThe map is easy to navigate, the economy of the game is easy to understand, there are overview windows that display everything your cities and mines are producing so you don’t have to hunt them down individually, and there is an easy to understand tech tree that even my nephew could operate efficiently. In fact, I often play this game with my young nephew and he is able to fully comprehend and play the game (which is a true testament as to how easy to understand the basic concepts are and the controls of the game are.)\n\nHowever, the game is not that easy to win. The AI will take full advantage of its navy, air force, and land armies to efficiently defend themselves, flank your armies, invade your homeland when you lest expect it, and even nuke you if you're not too careful.\n\nAnother plus, is that the multiplayer in this game doesn’t have lag or syncing issues.\n\nThe game also runs well on older computers as well, I got it to run rather well on an old 2003 XP laptop of mine.\n\nThe game also comes with an scenario editor which is easy to use and adds lots of replay value.\n\nIn essence, this game is somewhat similar to the Hearts of Iron games, except that it’s more simplistic and turn-based.\n\nIn all, I would highly recommend this game to anyone seeking a sandbox turn-based WW2 strategy game. The game's low price is also a nice plus. However, if you are looking for an extremely in depth realistic game of WW2, I would suggest looking elsewhere.","October 24, 2015","true","38.7"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","0"

The unit organization is easy to get the hang of, dividing, combining, and renaming armies are quite intuitive.  Supply levels are limited to one type, Arms, which helps you focus strategically instead of trying to micromanage many different kinds of supplies for your armies.\n\nTrading is as complicated as you want it to be.  You can just put in trade requests, or you can micromanage the trades as more resources come into the market.  However, trades will be handed off to other parties automatically, which is a benefit if you don't want to pay particular attention to trading.  Although if you don't watch it, you'll find yourself trading with a nation you didn't want to, because they took over some of your 'contracts' so to speak.\n\nImproving your infrastructure is easy and involves upgrading your roads, agricultural improvements, and reducing or expanding your mine output.  It keeps it out of your way, and you get easy updates on progress.  This is the same as choosing production, it's easy, and there aren't so many options you can get lost.\n\nAll of this is a boon to you, because it makes it easier to focus on your strategy and tactics, which to be fair aren't incredibly in depth, but enough that you can benefits for cutting off enemy army supplies (combat penalties), and you can blitz behind combat to disrupt enemy production.  Air units can be assigned to support a battle, or you can target reinforcements, producing cities, attack enemy fleets, provide air cover, they are a help but not overbalanced.  Combat is a bit abstract with the computer AI sometimes splitting up a huge number of units into small groups, it can be hard to maintain a cohesive front, but generally they will try to overcome your largest troop concentration by refocusing their units, so it isn't uncontrollable.\n\nHistorically the game tries to be accurate, with some events coded into the game, but you can have an immense impact on outcomes, even if you play a smaller nation.  I've had crazy match-ups where Japan allies with America to fight the German and Soviet menace.  You can stall the Nazi menace, or you can join it and help out, you can preempt the entire war and launch an unprovoked attack on the Germans with America, or try flip the world on its head by trying to become an Argentinian Axis super power.  The depth and fluidity of the diplomacy system is also simple, perhaps more simple than it should be, but it works well with the rest of the mechanics.\n\nIn short, the game is unbeatable at this price, and even if it cost more it's literally pennies per hour of play, and if you get bored of the included scenarios there are a vast amount of user created ones to choose from.  Did I mention the game includes a map/scenario editor?  It does, and if you wanted to create the Drakon world of S.M. Stirling, go ahead.","December 2, 2015","true","277.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

Everything plays out independently. No scripted historical events.\n\nYou can play starting in different time-frames, but at its heart, the game is a giant "WW2 sandbox" game. **NOTE: Although game "scenarios" have an "end-date", GAME IS ENDLESS. You can keep playing. You can adjust Scenario setttings to customize.\n\nSome aspects remind me of:\nSuperpower 2 (RTS game) you can wage war on any nation, make treaties, do whatever you want on a 3D Google-Earth like map.\nSupreme Ruler 2020 (RTS game) is like that but on flat 3D map, and more complicated, in that you can build unique, individual structures on each territory you control.\n\nMaking History is sort of like a fusion of both, you don't quite have "buildings" on each territory, rather just cities and oil wells mostly on some, but you have all the tools needed to manage each individual territory. Boost production of Goods in Alaska, upgrade farms in Florida, improve infrastructure in New York. Etc.\n\nBiggest downside to this is that it's USELESS, and the interface/menu system is cumbersome and confusing. BUT THAT'S OK. The game is actually WAY more simple than you think.\n\nThe biggest problem most people will have with this game is simply "overthinking" the game\n\nWHY?\n\nI played as the USA starting around 1935 or 1936, and spent 10 years of game time, actually BALANCING my budget, selling resources to warring alliances, and making a profit; trying to balance trade, etc. HOWEVER, I couldn't figure out how the computer was producing massive amounts of tanks, ships, troops, etc. Not only were the computer players producing them fast, the computer was producing them in large numbers.\n\nThere was no way I could product as fast without destroying my economy.\nHow could the computer balance it's economy and do this?\n\nThe answer: IT DIDN'T!\n\nYES, the computer nations all went into MAJOR debt.\nLike a few other strategy games, you can go "into debt". If you reach zero, you then go into the red.\nAnd NO, your assets don't start getting magically "sold off" like in certain other games.\nNo, you still have everything, you just owe a lot of money......to SOMEONE. Who?\n\nWHO CARES!\n\nSO, when you get this game, FORGET about managing the economy, it's all a waste of time.\nIn this game, when you go into "debt", it only lowers the effectiveness of your units and a few things, but I found it rather unnoticeable.\n\nALL YOU HAVE TO DO:\nSet all of your areas to maximize production.\nAs for what to produce: set about 90% of them to upgrade industry. A city's industry is rated by a simple point system. A city worth 20 industry points, is usually "Light Industry". If you set production to whatever "Industry" option it has, after X number of turns, it will gain a point. Turns can go fast, so before you know it, it might become "Heavy Industry" and later to "Advanced" (Advanced can build units others can't, like Advanced tanks, nuke bombers, super-carriers, etc).\n\nWHY DO THIS?\nBecause the higher it's industry point rating, the FASTER you can produce units.\nYou'll need to set the rest to produce Research and Transport Capacity (if not enough Transport Capacity points, you won't be able to move all your units overseas at once, they'll have to 'wait for the next ride').\n\nThat's about it. You'll be spamming out units in no time, and sending them into the grinder of an endless World War.\n\nYou will go into massive debt, but it doesn't affect gameplay all that much at all.\nI was like $149 billion or trillion in debt by the end of my game. NO BIG DEAL.\nThat's too bad, but I guess maybe the developers found the economic system too restricting on enjoying the game.\n\nThat was the problem Supreme Ruler 2020 had, the economy system was made by people who didn't know how economies work. They tried to make it the way they "envisioned" only to have it cripple the game (not to mention all the ridiculous click-fest with logistics) that detracted from enjoying the game. Yikes. Making History keeps it simple and let's you focus on gameplay.\n\nDIPLOMACY:\nVery, very limited. It's basically you can join an alliance, leave an alliance, or try to get another country to join in an alliance with you. The computer players will leave/join alliances all the time. Like "1984", you'll be at war with mortal enemy "Eurasia" for a long time, only until one day, to now be at peace with them, and at war with new mortal enemy "East Asia", the next day.\nThis aspect of the game can actually turn out to be pretty fun at times, watching nations for "super alliances" and then stab each other in the back. I wish there were more diplomacy options, but this is a war game after all. HAHAHAH.\n\nTerritories/provinces can also break off and become part of a new nation.\nYou can even grant independence to conquered areas and make them an alliance, you'll see new nations formed frequently. You'll see Nazi Germany maybe take over Ireland and form a Nazi Ireland. Or Soviets take over India and form Communist India.\nThere are competing ideologies in the game that are visible and those with similar ideologies will favor relations with each other over others.\n\nCONTROL:\nControlling armies is EASY. You just click on a unit, and tell it where to go. Sort of like the Europa Universalis games. Only thing, sometimes, seems like units not moving but it's really they need time to cross out of large territory and enter next one. In those EU games, you'll see a meter or bar that shows progress but no in this one. Not a big deal, just a cosmetic thing.\nYou can also stack and split units, so no problem there.\n\nNO NEED to load units on ships or anything. When you tell them to go overseas, they are automatically converted into a "ship" fleet unit. Of course, they are weak. Best to clear the way or have ships patrolling the zones they must go through to stop enemy raiders.\n\nEDITOR:\nThe game comes with an editor so you can make your own mod/world, edit unit stats, edit countries, anything. Can be a bit cumbersome to put together. People have made some online you can download through developer's site. I haven't tried any though.\n\nCONS:\n-The economic system, while totally useless, the menus/navigating suck. You won't use it much anyways, but finding out it's useless after wasting so much time, was frustrating "You mean I don't have to manage any of this, I can go into trillions of dollar in debt and still fight on just fine?!" I hear the "Gold" version of this game, makes the menus easier.\n\n-Nukes! You can build ICBM and mobile-nuke units, HOWEVER, they fight like regular units, that only do major damage; but they are weak and get destroyed easily. STRATEGIC NUKE BOMBERS are the only "real" nuke units. You can direct them to nuke a city. If it succeeds, the city is permanently destroyed. It will just be ruins without any production ability.\n\n-Subs can't be set to auto-defend an area. If an enemy surface ship enters water area you have a surface ship in, they automatically fight. If you have a sub, they don't fight. You have to manually order them, which enables enemies to sail right by. FAIL!\n\n-Loading game, you have to remember to reselect your nation. You can load your saved game, play as other nation. By default, the nation you saved game playing as should already be selected.\n\nIf you're looking for some "historically accurate" WW2 game, you can forget about it.\nIt's MAKING HISTORY: you make your own history---ITS FUN TO DO!\nThe game goes on for however long it takes for you to reach your goal.\nI conquered the entire world around 1957. I had modern supercarriers and jet fighters by that time, 638 warships, like 1300 armored divisions.\n\nVery rewarding game.","October 10, 2015","true","89.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","1"

At first I thought that the only difference is the lack of some campaign scenarios - mainly the one that starts at 1933 and gives you so much time to develop them unstoppable armies! But after I played one of the shorter ones I came to some conclusions:\n\nthe color palettes are a bit off and not so smooth on my eyes - easily changed in the Gold version\nthe infrastructure is VERY slow to develop - really 72 turns to upgrade one level? And I thought Gold taking 17 turns was slow.\nHUGE maintenance costs! Why spend 1/5th of the campaign in upgrading a slot if in the end it will cost half your GDP to maintain? No such problem in Gold.\nat first I thought "Why does research cost so little points? Now I can pump Heavy tanks before everyone else!" - yeah but no - research is compleatly RNG based so even at full IPU those 25 research poins can take 100+ turns to make...\nall units have only one combat "value" which makes gameplay blunt as it doesn't matter what armies you build. In Gold each unit has Attack and Defense - this for instance makes infantry very hard to deal with and while tanks have huge attack power they are probably the first to fall in battle due to low defense.\na lot of other nitpicks that I could point out but they aren't that gamebreaking.\nWhat I am trying to get at is this - there are a lot of balance issues with the game but chances are unless you've played the Gold version, you might not notice some at all and thats good. Just letting you know there is a better version out there that is  currently not on Steam. That being said I still think this series is amazing.\n\n5/10\n\n8/10 for Making History: The Calm & the Storm Gold Edition\n\nEdit: Gold is LIVE on Steam!

Of course there are no real time battles to speak of but that does make the game more calculating in the fact that you don't really control the outcomes of battles.\n\nPositives:\n\nMany times you will fight your own world war II fighting for power and struggling for dominance! The A.I. is great with unrelenting force they will plow through an opening in your defenses and quickly consolodate their forces if you attak.\nOn a player VS COMP map you will quickly realize how aggresive the A.I is. You can no longer declare war on all the weaker nations and exspect the world powers to not respond. You then will have to face down pretty much anyone who is not allied with you for the desperate resource grabbing to keep your war machine up.\nIn this way the game makes it's greatest sucess at a slower paced game with a good amount of tension.\n\nNegatives: There is a ♥♥♥♥ing lot of them\n\nThe game of course has it's flaws and should not be overlooked. Me being the man I am could not handle mainstreaming WWII as germany or the U.S. so I liked to play as smaller nations who can barely hold their own. All to quickly you will realize this is impossible as the major players like Germany and the U.S. have WAY too much under their belt from the get go and will trample you if you dare attack anyone they like.\nThe game also gets repetitive. Fast. If you like WWII games than you will find this game able to last you a long time but that does not change the fact that A.I. have limitations and will work together to fight the player being as superior as you are rather than the German Facists who are right at their doorstep.\n\nThe diplomacy as with pretty much any stratagy game is underdeveloped and lacks any real options.\nThe trade seems unfair, almost designed so you have to give up on something to get anything (which is realistic, but does not help the gameplay) you almost can never have enough goods or especially arms to get you anywhere. AND GOD FORBID you have a large army and try to produce arms for it. Your resources (most notably your oil) will go down so damn fast that you can't hold it up for more that 10 turns.\n\nGames are over relatively quickly in this game(we are talking 2-3 hours max) and don't even have a "turn limit off" or a "Conquest" game mode. Though the game does help itself by allowing you to keep playing indefinately even after the game has ended. So a "kinda" conquest mode\n\nYou are gonna wan't to play with other players. Preferably people you know so you can set up rules and have an actually fun time. (randoms don't bring the thrill of fighting your friends.)\n\nAlso while you do struggle sometimes. Once you get a hold of this game it can be pretty easy to play so I would recommend turning that default difficulty up a notch.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nThis game is worth buying for five dollars but no more. I would actually recommend you buy one of the newer Making Historys as I have heard/read that they have adressed many of these issues.\nStill when I picked up this game it was less than a dollar. (like 78 cents) and that was a steal for this game so if you a money grubber like me. Wait for the sale to happen again or just pay the damn five dollars I mean I payed over 9 dollars in copies for my friends to play with me because they are struggling hard right now.\n\nBut I repeat For FIVE DOLLARS this game is well worth it. So pick it up now and relive WWII while you still got the motivation in you.\nOFF TO THE BATTLEFIELD!!!","May 24, 2014","true","66.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When you are brand new to this type of game you will find it difficult as it is pretty hard to tell whether you are doing well or not since you are constantly having shortages of most resources. The game is enjoyable as you slowly take land when you play as the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany. However in saying that, the game didn't really strike chords with me as I just couldn't really grasp it. When you try to improve your economy rather than going on a warpath (Mind you making your country economically sound before war is probably the first thing to do) is really hard to understand. I went online to see if I could improve my skills but I just hit a wall.\n\nThe game is somewhat fun but I personally think it will only be a hit with a few strategic enthusiasts.\n\n6.5/10","March 26","false","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Most of them are either too limiting or too complicated for me. This one has the perfect recipe of simplicity and very complex design. Here's a short story based on one of my games:\n\nThe U.S. sat back as Germany was taking over Europe, they knew it would happen but weren't yet ready to fight back, it wasn't an immediate danger to them anyway. Finally after years of research they developed nuclear weaponry and ICBMs. They were ready to take down Germany.\nA message was sent the the UK asking for permission to use their land to launch the nukes from to finally help put an end to this war, but the requested was rejected and met with a declaration of war. So the U.S. nuked London then Germany invited the U.S. into their alliance. The U.S. sent hundreds of tanks straight into the UK and took over then basically sat back and watched as Germany took over the rest of Europe with Italy's help.\n\nThere is a lesson here, always give the U.S. permission to launch nukes off your territory. :D","December 1, 2015","true","66.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is definitely one of the best games I own on Steam for Grand Strategy. I have had many adventures in this such as playing as America and carving a path through Europe destroying everything in my way and ruling the world in 1946 or playing as Great Britain and capturing Spain, France and parts of Germany in the late 30s. The replayability is huge simply because ANYTHING can happen. The game does encourage you to follow History but you are able to do whatever you want. Playing as Germany for example, befriend France and Great Britain and tackle the Red Menace or my favorite play as America and never getting involved in the war but selling arms to both sides to fuel the conflict the possibilities are endless.\n\n\nThere is one issue however and unfortunately it is gamebreaking. After you start it up a few times it will tell you it's missing a key. There are some fixes to this but none worked for me and I contacted Muzzy Lane directly. They gave me a key to redeem on their website and I was sorted. The fixes do work for some people so I advise giving it a try before contacted the Devs first.  That is why I have only played for 4-5 hours on Steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mjpc88/recommended/6250/","mjpc88","[22ndVA]Dubayoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mjpc88/","425 products in account","The watered down Hearts of Iron model that emulates Axis and Allies is admirable, but the broken diplomacy and logistics mechanics ruin the game. Communist China can be liberated by Japan to become fascist. Countries will declare war on you even if buffer states are in the way. You can't test factories to see how long they'll take to produce something else without actually resetting the original production process in case you don't like how long your option would take. This is especially awful with gearing. If you produce the same item back to back, you get a production discount, but that discount disappears from testing.\n\nIf you want to ally with someone, but another member of your alliance disapproves, you're screwed. Alliances only come in the way of coalitions. You can't end up with complicated situations like what happened with Finland or Poland in real life between the Western allies and the Soviets. You also can't end up with complicated situations like how Germany and Japan signed alternating neutrality pacts with the Soviets while the other one was fighting it. Latin America often screws things up because of this too. Don't be surprised if Argentina or Brazil get you into trouble.\n\nThis is especially awful when trying to liberate countries too. If you and another country like America and Britain invade someone like France, you can't liberate your territories on your own if you don't capture the capital. Transferring becomes possible only after you annex territories instead of simply occupying them, and you can't annex until a war is over. Some countries like Germany won't surrender until completely conquered, so you're stuck until the very end of the war. Furthermore, you have to feed and supply them based on penalized farming and factories that can't produce 100% food or goods like if they were liberated. This can be a serious drain on your economy.\n\nThe opposite situation also applies in case you and someone like Germany and Italy invade France. The computer is very reluctant to transfer territories even if you're in a strongarm position. If Italy grabs some wealthy or connecting territories you want while allied, then you can't tell him to give them to you because the AI's so stubborn. This is especially important when fortifying the Atlantic Wall to prevent the D-Day counterattack. Italy can leave major gaps in your line. Also, you can technically sign peace treaties that force countries to change ideology (like how Vichy France became fascist, or how post-war West Germany became democratic), but this rarely ever works. The computer forces other computer countries to change ideology all the time, but it will never listen to you.\n\nOh... and don't get me started on transport capacity either when trying to ferry troops across oceans and seas. There's no way at all to tell if you have not enough or too much transport capacity. It's a guessing game the whole way through. The same thing goes for figuring out how strong your relationship needs to be with another country to directly buy or sell resources so you don't have to gamble with free trade over time. Aid never works either. The United States won't help Britain defend against the blitz... not that Germany will even try it. It hardly ever tries to take Africa, and Italy always fails miserably. Britain never retakes the Middle East either. Iraq and Iran always remain independent. Heck, it usually takes South Africa to liberate Ethiopia...\n\n...and don't even try to invade China as Japan. The computer always does it, but it knows how much TC it needs.\n\nThere are just major issues with this game. It doesn't really work unless you want to play as the Germans or Russians to conquer the world, and don't want to ally the Japanese in the process since they'll make issues for you with overlapping British, French, Dutch, and American Pacific colonies.

This verbal abuse is fueled by an excessive consumption of alcohol. George being an associate History professor in a New Carthage university where Martha's father is the President adds an extra dimension to their relationship. Late one Saturday evening after a faculty mixer, Martha invites Nick and Honey, an ambitious young Biology professor new to the university and his mousy wife, over for a nightcap. As the evening progresses, Nick and Honey, plied with more alcohol, get caught up in George and Martha's games of needing to hurt each other and everyone around them. The ultimate abuse comes in the form of talk of George and Martha's unseen sixteen year old son, whose birthday is the following day.\n\nReview paid for by: Nabisco","May 3, 2013","true","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

I proceeded to buy the game as it was very cheap (And still is) and was immediately thrown into the shoes of Stalin and had to fight off Nazi Germany alongside the U.S.A and Britain.\n\nIf you're a history lover or a stratedgy lover then this is definitely the game for you as this little cheap and relitively unknown game ranks highly in my top games of all time.\n\nDuring one playthrough (The one I mentioned before) I had at least 20 hours of gameplay and ended up ending the game in 1979 when Europe was dominated by the U.S.S.R and the U.S.A and it had reached a massive stalemate in the Cold War where the U.S.A had a far superior military force which I (The U.S.S.R) could not match, without the use of nuclear weapons. Instead I had proceeded to go to war with Britain (Somehow the U.S.A didn't intervene) although this war went nowhere, apart from Russia capturing most of Britain's colonies in Asia and Africa. Britain resisted every attempt for a landing on British soil, so I ended the war with London being nuked, causing Britain to surrender.\n\n9/10 - Would dictate again.","April 16, 2014","true","59.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Its diplomatic model is obtuse, and unable to actually reflect events of the period (when one person in an alliance is at war, it's all in, so you can't have Italy's late entry or Japan being part of the Axis but not at war), the combat model is reasonable enough - simple but effective - but production is a mess (it's hard to tell, but it looks like you need the same amount of consumer goods whether you're at war or not), and the UI gets pretty fiddly.  On top that, the starting force set-ups are incredibly ahistorical (Germany starts with a larger army than UK and France combined, in 1936!).  It's too complicated to be accessible, and too simple (and ahistorical) to draw in enthusiasts of the period.","November 15, 2014","false","2.7"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","10","23","0","0"

I bought the game becuase it's strategy and at the time of writing this, it was on sale. I did not expect this game to be this good. Even if you pay the full five dollars you will still get alot of good fun out of this game because it far outweighs the value of the price tag. Spoole, if you read this, choose this game for 1 Dollar 1 Hour.

Dislike not having the sway of a changing in hand Government. Would like to see the ability to sway government to desired policy ie. Pumping money into propaganda to turn say Mother Russia into democratic Capatalist from communism and still remain in control without changing into NPC faction. One thing this game lacks is a check box when in control of a territory to have a supply kill switch. population control ie. no food  = starvation decrease population. China needs vast amounts of food. Just some ideas for anyone that understands how to create mods.\n","November 21, 2015","true","88.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
