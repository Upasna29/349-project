Very unique. But it is not for everyone.\n\nIf you like unusual, ugly, trippy, mindf**king, and creepy games like LSD: Dream Emulator, then this game is for you. If not, immediately look elsewhere.\n\nAnyway, this game has a lot of unique and creative ideas you often don't find in other games. You take photos of people and things around the village to find information and secrets about everything going on in the area. You end up finding and being in situations where you will say "WHAT THE HECK" to youself and develop uneasy feelings about everything. The atmosphere, espeically the busted and ugly graphics, was made to portray uneasiness and creepiness. It works really well for this game, because you will be taking pictures of people and things without permission which obviously makes you a creeper to others in the game.\n\nOverall, a good low budget game with a nice story made for fans who like extremely creepy and trippy stuff.\n\n7.0 out of 10","January 25","true","8.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

But it's so eerie, and the way the camera allows you to shape the narrative, and your perspective, is super neat. Honestly felt myself being drawn in until the very end. (I am writing this review mere minutes after finishing it, heh, it just deserves a recommendation so much.) It's supposedly based on some real places, people, folklore, and events that I'm definitely going to look into later. If you're looking for a spooky and unique experience, check out 1,000 Heads Among the Trees!\n\nEDIT: Just wanna acknowledge that a lot of people criticize the execution of this game... And I'll admit it's certainly not perfect. But if you can appreciate something for atmosphere, and if you are willing to compromise having any linear, cut and dry story in favor of a narrative shaped by exploration and personal perspective, then you should be able to enjoy this game.","May 9","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You find yourself in the South American town of Cachiche, Peru and using a local Brujo as a guide (Brujo means something like Shaman or male witch) you explore this extremely trippy town. The graphics are not super slick BUT the way the graphics are works perfectly with the story. The colors, the feel of the game, all of the way the game is designed,  mimics my own experience South of the border, though I didnt meet any male witches with motorcycles, unfortunately ;) I enjoed that feeling and I am amazed at how weel the game was able to trap and capture such ephemeral feelings of being a stranger in a strange land. I had no issues with game play, no stuttering, no walking through walls, sound works perfectly, no problems, nada. The game runs smoothly and apparently has different endings depending (I believe) on where you go, who you speak to, etc... I definitely recommend this game for those who like out of the box games which are creative and follow an intriguing storyline. 9/10","January 15","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Just overpriced and not for everyone. It gives you the freedom to roam around a creepy atmospheric perusian town at night searching for ghosts. With its out of tune bizzare cords that play and strange happenings that happen it makes it a joy to explore the town. It's ominous and near the end I actually did not want to keep playing, because I jsut knew something terrifying was gonna happen. I definently reccomend this game on a sale and if you like creepy games that dont hold your hand throughout the whole story.","April 24","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
