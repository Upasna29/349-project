Hopefully the devs will have a online coop implemented relatively soon.","April 22, 2015","true","2.1"," 34 of 55 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","34","55","5","0"

It creates moves like "quadruple jump" and also situations where you have to stack your characters in particular color order to navigate passed obstacles!\n\nThis is a great example of how a co-op game should be!","February 14","true","1.1"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

So I'd been chomping at the bit since I heard about the game last December.  And Kalimba did not disappoint!  Some notes:\n\n* stacking is harder than it looks... you need a ledge or a hole or something to do it\n* more platform-y than puzzle-y\n* difficult, but not extremely so (as some reviews implied)\n* did not cause any existential marriage crises (as some reviews warned)\n* got very exciting at some points\n* similar feel to ibb&obb, but we liked Kalimba much better\n* visual style is very nice\n* lots of jokes that are ... somewhat funny\n\nThe scoring system is up to 70 points for getting all the goodies, minus 1 for each death.  The goodies are kept even when you die.  So you can get a pretty good score without being amazing, but it's quite hard to get all 70 points (and a golden totem).\n\nThe game is VERY short.  We completed all 20 co-op levels (so including dark void DLC) in 3 hours.  We didn't get 70 points in all the levels, and I'd say there's about a 50-50 chance that we care enough to go back.  Many of the levels introduced interesting gamplay mechanics, but by the end thing started to feel same-y.\n\nSo if you want to play a co-op puzzle platformer and you and your partner are both decent at platformers, then get this game!","May 3, 2015","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The sound, art and gameplay are all fantastic and really sets this game apart from other puzzle-platformers. The co-op is is a mix of coordination, frustration and fun which will test even the best of friendships.

The meta hoebear was kinda funny and cool, the story was intruiging enough, and the graphics looked nice. The first few levels took some brain tugging, but nothing overly complex. When the game introduced changeable gravity the game went from recommend to not. If you are using the keyboard you are forced to use left control as the gravity switcher. It might seem fine, but when you have to make twitchy moves it becomes impossible because you cannot use the right arrow and control at the same time. If the devs added in changeable controls I would return to the game. For now I'll let it sit in the library.","June 8, 2015","false","2.8"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

I enjoy the game, the little bit that I've played I think the mechanics are fun, and the gameplay is challenging.\n\nThat said, I think that it's simply inconceivable in the year 2015 to not have online co-op as an option.  I've heard people say, "it's just not possible to play this over the internet, the amount of communication the players need to have simply makes it impossible to play online."  I think that's just a crock of bologna, team speak, Skype, Mumble, Vent and any number of other VOIP services mean that you can have just as much communication over the web as you can with somebody sitting in the same room.\n\nI think this game definitely has that nostalgic feel to it, but for a modern age, like an evolved Mario or Kirby but I just can't believe it doesn't have online co-op.","April 26, 2015","false","2.2"," 6 of 27 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","6","27","0","1"

I didn't try improving my scores, but the ranking system that puts deaths and collectibles in a tug of war is really smart. Great art and audio. Hoe Bear as a story teller is a little out of place, but I still enjoy the silliness in the writing.\n\nOverall it's a great game that ends before it outstays its welcome. The DLC adds some cool mechanics and is a little harder, but it made me sad to see what becomes of the characters that I enjoyed pre-DLC.","May 2, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
