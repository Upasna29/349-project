Simple trolls wearing sumo diapers - then you have very specific tastes, and while this game does provide those things, you should probably lower your standards in general for your own wellbeing.\nYou lovable nut.","July 7, 2015","true","21.6"," 175 of 183 people (96%) found this review helpful 162 people found this review funny","96","175","183","162","1"

You'll journey trough decaying underground world filled with dark ritual, bloodthirsty enemies and eldritch horrors.\nPatience, experimentation and careful exploration are often rewarded, and also quite often -required- in a way that is rarely seen in modern games: Arx offers little to no hand holding to players during their journey through its sprawling, interconnected dungeons - thorough exploration and paying attention to clues and readables are keys to making any sort of progress!\nGame isn't without flaws tho: magic system, while original and also quite impressive in a sheer number of offered spells and their possible effects, is also somewhat clunky, and spellcasting is often unresponsive. Controls & interface in general will take some time to get used to.\nWhile game offers to player a freedom to develop his character in many possible directions, some skills are definitely far more useful than others, and some playstyles are far less developed than others. Stealth system for example is quite unrefined, and while it is sometimes useful and at some points borderline required to sneak (say early encounters with dreaded Ylside warriors), stealth tends to be rather useless and unsatisfying.\nThere is quite a bit of different types of fun-to-use melee weapons, each with their own pros and cons. Ranged combat on the other hand, while quite useful at times, is made unnecessarily monotonous by the fact that the player is offered all of -two- bows, second one being pretty much unreachable on first playthrough without any outside help.\nStill, I'd say this game's assorted shortcomings are -very much- worth dealing with, and are far, FAR outweighed by its many qualities.\n\nPretty much recommended to anyone with some patience and willingness to deal with game's flaws and idiosyncrasies.\n\nAlso, i highly recommend using Arx Libertatis: it offers additional bug fixes and eliminates issues with modern hardware.","April 11, 2015","true","42.8"," 104 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","104","110","0","2"

It's a relatively obscure RPG title that gives a fairly interesting setting and good mechanics.\n\nThe game is good overall, but it's definitely rough around the edges.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe game is pretty immersive, with full first person and complete view of limbs and equipment. There are plenty of things to loot, plenty of things to kill. The game is also very atmospheric: lots of dank caves with dark ambience playing. The RPG elements are mostly good, but there's not much character interaction, no real dialogue trees. I have a lot of fun exploring dungeons in the game, they can go pretty deep and pretty wide. There are lots of immersive touches, like having to drag things manually into the inventory, to manually drawing runes to cast spells, to even staking zombies to make sure they stay dead. It helps make the game feel alive.\n_____\n\nCONS:\n\nThe game barely conveys any information to the player; I've had to rely on walkthroughs extensively. The journal is worthless, it tells nothing about current tasks or reminders of where to go. If important details from dialogue are missed, they can't be found again. Navigation is nightmarish as there are no clear paths to get to locations, everything is located on separate underground levels. The game also is unbalanced in terms of combat and specialization. Playing as a thief or as just a warrior is suicidal, as a certain kind of enemy late-game cannot be easily killed with brute force. I had to restart my game to play as a sort of battlemage build, and now everything is easier.\n\n_____\n\nIt's a pretty mixed bag overall. If one likes RPGs with somewhat original settings, compelling mechanics, plenty of immersion, and plenty of loot, then this game is good if one can look past the glaring flaws.","November 9, 2013","true","32.6"," 77 of 80 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","77","80","0","2"

Each spell consists of several rune letters. In order to cast a spell, you need to literally draw the runes on the screen with your mouse. In theory, it seems innovative and sounds like a lot of fun. However, it's not practical. You really need to be very accurate in drawing the runes; otherwise, you'll fail to cast your spells. It's extremely hard to do it in combat, as being under pressure (and battered by monsters), you often feel unable to focus on drawing, and usually fail to draw the runes accurately enough to be able to cast successfully. Luckily, you can pre-cast a few spells, but even pre-casting can sometimes be quite laborious. I would sometimes spend literally minutes trying to cast some spells consisting of the more difficult runes. For me, this was the most irritating part of the game.\n- Some aspects of the game seem to be a little unbalanced, e.g. Ylsides are extremely fast and strong, and they kill you within seconds - you can meet them early in the game, but you won't really be able to deal with them successfully until very late in the game; also, towards the end of the game, you may run out of life potions - you won't be able to buy them or find any plants to make them on your own\n- There are a few bugs and glitches here and there...\n- NPCs and monsters have a tendency to get caught in between various objects, like parts of walls, doors, etc. They simply get stuck and can't move. Well, that's how I killed a few Ylsides...\n- When saving, once I gave a name to a save file, I couldn't change it later\n- It's a 2002 game, so don't expect visuals like in Skyrim...\n\n\nAll things considered, I experienced a lot more fun than irritation with this game. Therefore, in my opinion, the game is worth playing.","July 20, 2014","true","74.2"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","0"

If you dont mind the slightly dated graphics I highly recommend you try it out.\n\nIf you go find Arx Libertatis, its a 'mod' for the game, it'll use the game files that you download through Steam, but optimize the game for use on newer machines. Unfortunately it didnt count me as playing on Steam so my game time counter didnt go up.\n\nInitally I was a lil skeptical of the onscreen gestural magic stuff, I've never been good at drawing symbols with a mouse but the game lets you precast three spells to hotkeys so you can instant cast later which is awesome. Melee is basic but effective: hold mouse button, gem glows, more it glows the more damage you do, release mouse to strike.\n\nAnyways sound is decent, graphics are dated but not ugly, theres a combine/crafting system so you can make things like a fishing pole from a piece of wood and rope, and theres potion brewing. You might need a paper and pen to keep track of everything, the journal isn't very helpful.\n\nIn closing definitely worth getting, especially at $5.","July 3, 2014","true","0.1"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/1700/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Arx Fatalis is the 2002 brainchild of Arkane Studios, a studio that went on to make Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, and Dishonoured. Notably, the game was intended to be Ultima: Underworld III, but the studio was unable to obtain the license. Even without it, this has been hailed as the spiritual successor to Ultima: Underworld, and rightfully so.\n\nIt's "inspirations" are as evident as they are positive. The right-click menu overlay, popular in its early 2000s peers, once again makes it return and proving that it never gets old. Arx Fatalis handles it a tad differently to others, keeping the overlay mostly bereft except for inventory and controlling the bulk through separate windows brought up via the journal.\n\nWhile manipulating the environment never gets old, the overlay itself does get clunky compared System Shock 2 or Morrowind. From inventories that give you separate windows when upgraded, instead of just making the existing window bigger, to useless, nigh unreadable maps, to the journal system that is Morrowind's, without all those pesky "search" functions.\n\nArx Fatalis boasts an "intelligent story", which is laughable. You start as the amnesiac named Am Shaegar, find out your purpose is to save the world, and then save the world. Along the way you bear witness to some incredibly hammy voice-acting, which falls directly into "so bad it's good" tier.\n\nThe worldbuilding itself is less hilariously trite. While the generic fantasy races stay generic fantasy races, the premise of being forced to live inside one big cavern system lends itself to some interesting towns and details - the giant pumps that flood the levels with air, for example. But Arx Fatalis hails to an era where the story wasn't the focal point of RPGs, pre-Infinity Engine.\n\nKing Lunshire's one-dimensional antics and cults that just evil cults only provide the background for the real draw: dungeon delving.\n\nThe game boasts being able to take care of enemies in a variety of ways. This is a lie. The game is based around a single playstyle - spellsword.\n\nDEX skills are useless and will get you killed\nStealth attacks cap out at 1.5 times the damage of a regular hit\nThe gesture system only recognizes perfectly drawn signs\nParticles of your runes fly off while running\nYour mana regen is incredibly slow\nThere's barely any bloody potions\nYou may be able to fireball or stealth a goblin to death, but try pulling that on a Ylside warrior and watch your dangly bits get plastered to the ceiling. Your magic will always play second fiddle to your sword, and DEX doesn't get a fiddle at all.\n\nIt's therefore a shame that the swordplay is so limited. Arx Fatalis falls into the traditional aRPG trap of having the majority of the combat be incredibly simple and boring. You take out your weapon. You charge up your weapon. You hit things with your weapon. There's several different animations but they change nothing. Footsies that amount to kiting. No real movesets, no real variety, and even the speed of combat is deplorably slow.\n\nIt fails basic decisions/time game design, a common problem with these games. Buffs aside, you will largely be doing the same exact 3-step sequence from beginning to end.\n\nThankfully the incredibly hard-hitting enemies combined with limited resources in the midst of battle, especially when up against a Ylside or a Lich, keeps these battles engaging to the end. They never become a chore. The payoff of lobbed limbs and exploding enemies is a bonus.\n\nThe dungeons themselves are fantastic. Far from open-world, these areas are distinctly level based and are flooded with hidden secrets - which unlike the barren and uninteresting landscapes of open world games, have withstood the test of time.\n\nThe rest of the game's elements are particularly notable. There's some sidequests, but the triggers are arbitrary and you'll most likely just luck into them. The puzzles you encounter within the dungeons themselves can quickly get tedious, and rely on searching the area for items or buttons which are hidden in annoying locations. Occasionally with physics, and Fatalis' physics system isn't as great as its item manipulation system.\n\nBut it wouldn't be a true dungeon delver without puzzles, would it?\n\nArx Fatalis is a relic, and its a relic in the best possible way. Hailing back to the best of Looking Glass' work and Ultima Underworld itself, for every clunky mechanic there's another aspect that counters it to make it work.\n\nIf you're looking for an oppressive dungeon-delving game with brilliantly designed levels and inventory mechanics which don't treat you liked a fool, then I couldn't recommend Arx Fatalis more.","August 28, 2015","true","23.5"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","0"

With stronger resources this game could have been very special indeed. For an old game (2002), the graphics are pretty good and sound in some instances quite amazing, the game engine has aged well. I played the game of Steam and in Windows 7 and it was more or less playable apart from some memory crashes - I learned to save often using all the save slots - you need to do this too, especially when you move between levels. It is best to play the game without any background noise such as the TV/ music or radio - believe that. Not only will you get immersed in the game world, beautifully crafted by the designers, you won't miss key information said aloud by your character and then never repeated!\n\nIt's a first person RPG/adventure set in a world where the sun has died so all races of the world live in a huge underground complex - the city is called Arx.\n\nArx Fatalis = fatal fortress (Latin)\n\nThe game does involve combat, magic and sneaking options. But most of the game requires exploring, adventuring, some puzzles (simple and fiendish) to solve, a lot of traversing to and fro.\n\nYou begin the game in a prison cell and yep, you guessed right, no memory of who you are! Wow, not seen that in a video game before. There follows an escape from prison and a gradual understanding of where you are and of your destiny. You escape the prison and then move onwards to different levels of the underground world, such as mining caves, spooky crypts, ice cavern (dragon) and a strange snake level!  It takes a while to learn the mechanics of the game but you give it a chance as the rewards will be many! Above all read and print off the manual so you have it with you. Yes ladies and gentlemen, this game was produced in the days where manuals actually were required reading and gave hints on how to traverse the game. Believe me it will answer about 75% of your questions.\n\nYour character has the normal ST,INT,DEX etc stats as well as skills to develop such as magic, technical skill, intuition. Every time you level up these can be increased. Combat is similar to that found in Morrowind where I often found myself moving in and out of combat and swinging whatever weapon I was using at the time. Not great but ok. The magic system is something else, it is rune based and you need to draw patterns on screen with your mouse. This is pretty amazing and at the beginning you learn a new PC gaming skill - let's face it - that is pretty unique. Runes can be found or purchased and your journal will update to show the new spells you can cast. Oh - you reckon it would be pretty damn impossible to cast a fireball as a giant evil looking spider is looking to bite your head off? READ IMPORTANT - you can pre-save three magic spells! Read the manual properly for goodness sake - just do it.\n\nYour journal shows your character stats, armour, inventory, magic book of spells and runes, map and some key information about the game interface and quests you need to complete. I stress "some". As an assistant in following the game story - the journal is next to useless. Exploration is encouraged and the game engine allows you to do some innovative stuff. The map is pretty useless too. Use a fishing rod to catch raw fish and then cook them next to a flame. Combine water with flour to create dough and then bake to create bread. I think you can combine it with apple to make apple pie. Oh - you need to eat and your character will moan when he is hungry. Apparently hunger was pretty common in earlier versions of this game but I think the latter patches made this less acute. Saying that, I did go through a stage where I was baking and cooking stuff a lot! Later in the game I stopped hoarding food and just munched down anything I found.\n\nYour inventory is grid based and cannot be sorted, despite what some have said. You can stack some items and expand the size later in the game. This could be better as you spend too much time on inventory management. On the first play through you end up hoarding. As you learn all the tricks and want to do another play through, it will be less problematic.\n\nThe storyline is quite interesting, you have no say on what needs to be done and there are no dialogue options. At certain points in the story a cut scene will update you. There a lot of hidden items and locations in the game and exploration is encouraged. The world is beautifully put together and there are some real unique places and characters to interact with. It is quite complex and therefore some things are not explained properly and you will need to do some internet research to help you progress. Some tips:\n\nBuy the key ring and combine all found keys with it.\nLearn how to pre cast spells - especially fireball.\nRead the manual and print it off.\nLearn how to make potions - especially heal. Learn it. The castle in the human city has an alchemist which allows you to distil potions.\nDon't worry about cash - I ended up with about £35k.\nSome magic rings will disappear from your inventory after a while, these have a 12/20 or something. Ring of Regeneration.\nRead the 'Races of Arx' book before going to find the dragon.\nFind the activate portal spell in game or online and write it down in the manual - for some reason this spell does not show in your spell book.\nYour character needs decent magic to progress end game due to very difficult melee warriors that will polish you off in two whacks.\nDon't worry about hoarding food - just eat stuff as and when you find it.\nSave often.\nShops are not always open, progress the story line and come back.\nCheck the keyboard control options to ensure you don't waste all your healing potions when trying to crawl or sneak!\n\nThere are some negatives. If you don't READ THE MANUAL, expect some frustrations with the game engine. The great magic system is limited as not all the spells are equally useful and I tended to play the whole game with fireball. However, you need to have decent magic to complete the game, do not go all out as a fighter or thief. Not everything is spoon fed to you, ultimately you can get where you need to go just by adventuring but sometimes a specific "go there" would be appreciated. There are only about 10 levels which you seem to traverse back and forward a lot, learn how to use the portals or this can be frustrating. The game world is complex and many things can be interacted with - this is also a downfall as often you need to make assumptions about how things work together.\n\nSummary - really is a great and unique game if you like RPG or first person dungeon adventure. World is quite amazing. Some difficulty with the game engine which most can be sorted by READING THE MANUAL. 40 hours+ on first play through and a few side quests not completed. Repetitive towards the end as it suffers from lack of additional quests and locations which would allow greater use of spells and your character.\n\nHighly recommended to those looking for Ultima Underworld 3","August 18, 2014","true","44.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

It's the same case with Arx Fatalis developed by Arkane. You will fell the same spark of genius  present years later in Dishonored.

Remember to play with the Libertatis mod, and do a little research before playing so as not to make a characer build which makes it VERY hard to progress later in game (suffice to say, you shouldn't make a pure fighter build). One of very few design flaws. And congrats to anyone who completes the game and uncovers all its secrets without resorting to Wiki for help!","January 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

And with good reason, it's one of the best.\nBut at the same time, another game came out by Arcane Studios that was shadowed by the success of Morrowind, a cult gem if you will of classic 3D PC gaming now all but virtuall forgotten save for a few souls who sought this title. What is Arx Fatalis? Is it good? Pros and Cons? Here's the run down.\nArx Fatalis is a first person semi-linear dungeon crawler where you play the role of Am Shaegar, a fantasy John Doe who wakes to find himself naked in a goblin prison in a world where the sun has died and the surviving peoples habitate in underground fortress cities and mines. The story follows Am Shaegar as he seeks to reclaim his memory, but along the way gets tossed into a series of events that could mean the end of the peoples of Arx and even the world.\nWhile the story is strong in the beginning, by the middle act the it becomes predictable and there aren't any big plot twists or holy hell I didn't see that coming moments, but many of the characters and races of creatures of encounter and/or fight make that journey from start to finish interesting.\nBecause this game is well over 10 years old, it hasn't aged well in terms of graphics. Even Morrowind, however, suffers the same issue, so don't take this as a con persay. However, I've found that the Steam version is a tad glitchy with its sounds or even graphics, whether that is an error on my end or not I can't be sure.\nCombat in this game is fun but takes a bit of time to get used to since depth in this world is a bit strange feeling when compared to modern first person games. There are dozens of weapons to find, enchant and utilize to bring death to the menagerie of baddies laid before you.\nPuzzles in this game are much like classic D&D puzzles or even old PC adventure games, which means they range from no ♥♥♥♥ easy to what the ♥♥♥♥ hard on the first playthrough. The magic system is also unique and I wished that Arcane had taken the time to re-explore that in later titles because the concept of drawing magic spells to cast them on the screen is quite fun, though a nightmare in the heat of combat.\nDifficulty can be...well, all over the board. Some enemies are unfairly overpowered even when you are higher level and certain spells and items that make fighting them easier aren't made clear in the game itself and are discovered through trial and error or game FAQs.\nPros: There are some horror elements and classic RPG elements that make this game feel like a classic. It's not difficult to pick up and get into, the characters and world is quite interesting, and the sound design is haunting (I seriously made a recording years ago of just background sounds in this game to use for Table Top role playing). The magic system takes getting used to along with combat, but once is mastered can make it hard to go back to other games of that time.\nCons: The game is sadly glitchy, the graphics did not age well and can lead to some headaches and eye strain during the first few minutes of play. Combat ranges from easy to unbeatable, puzzles aren't really spelled out, the map system needs work, and the story gets weak by the middle of the game.\nAll in all I rank this a 3 out of 5, its a game from my youth that I loved that nostalgia draws me back to for fond memories and aggrivating flashbacks of unkillable bosses. Its well worth the price here on steam and there are patches and mods all over the internet that fix some of these complaints. I'd like to see an HD revamp or even remake of this game, so fingers crossed.","December 2, 2013","true","11.5"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

The game relies heavily on puzzle and problem solving, which I found refreshing over its action oriented counterparts.  Not only that, some encounters are downright difficult, but the feeling of conquering these challenges is reward enough.  Additionally there is a fun rune drawing system to spell casting that puts an interesting spin on spell combat.\n\nArx hearkens back to the old days of first person dungeon crawlers which I found to be a blast of nostalgia.  Back in the ol' days (Read early 90's PC play), a lot of first person RPGs took place entirely either in a dungeon or underground complex, or indoors in some way (probably due to the fact you didn't have to render much). Arx also has it's share of secret doors and buttons hidden in the underground walls not dissimilar to what you'd expect during that era.\n\nIf you're going to play it on a modern PC system, you should probably download Arx Liberatis, a fan made mod that adapts the game to modern systems.  I had found that the game was almost unplayable for me until I installed the mod.\n\nYou can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com","July 26, 2015","true","0.4"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Because this is the closest we're ever going to get to an Ultima Underworld 3. It was originally designed to be a sequel, but the dev's couldn't get hold of the official license from EA, so they just filed off all the serial numbers and called it Arx Fatalis. Make no mistake, though - this is Ultima Underworld in all but name.\n\nThe story of Arx Fatalis sets you in a dungeon world where no one lives on the surface since the Sun was snuffed out some years ago. From there you begin as the classic prisoner arc type with no memory, set to escape from your goblin captors, for game-play It has physics similar to Morrowind but superior combat and graphics and an interesting spellcasting system.\n\nOverall, this game is worth buying if you like games like Morrowind and Gothic. However. If you played Morrowind and want more of that, play Arx Fatalis. After that, you may want to look at Deus Ex.\n\nIMO Arx Fatalis is up there with Deus Ex and System Shock 2 as one of the best FPS-RPG hybrids ever made.","September 5, 2013","true",""," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

Feels a lot like a smaller-scale TES:Morrowind. There are only a few problems with it, one being the fact that overall, the game is pretty small (at least as far as I can tell, having not yet beat it; they elude to the possibility that there are more large areas you can go to, but I don't yet know if you can or not), and another being that the game feels somewhat linear, though you're free to go wherever you want, so long as you've come far enough along in the main quest. It has some cool features with it, most notably that you cast spells by writing the gestures onto the screen with the mouse. It's pretty nifty, I really like it. The setting is also pretty unique. Basically, you've got a standard fantasy world. However, the sun dies and the surface is plunged into eternal winter. The sentient races unite and spend the five years leading up to the loss of the sun moving their civilizations underground. It turns the whole thing into a subterranean dungeon crawl RPG, which I really respect in a game. I'd recommend anyone play it who like first person RPGs. However, do note that some newer systems will have problems playing it. I personally have found the game playable only through the Arx Libertatis fan mod. If it doesn't work for you or there are general issues with it, try the aforementioned mod, it might get the game working for you.","June 17, 2013","true","0.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Arx Fatalis has been in my top ten favourite games since release.\n\nSome of the highlights:\n---------------------------\n- Logical, somewhat realistic inventory crafting & recipes. Experimentation is a must!\n- An unsurpassed magic system; Logical combinations of words have different effects.\n- More atmosphere than you can shake a stick at! A truly claustrophobic underground world.\n- A 'hardcore' mentality in an easy to pick up and play game; no hand-holding, thought required!\n- Some of the puzzles are FANTASTIC.\n- Lots of varied locations, items and secrets to discover.\n\n\nSome of the low points:\n--------------------------\n- It's an OLD game. Without the Arx Libertatis mod (link below) it's actually unplayable, in a very literal sense.\n- Wasn't the best looking game when it released, hasn't changed. Not UGLY, but by no means pretty.\n- The melee combat is CLUNKY. It's a chore to fight tough enemies at times if you're a sword & board player.\n- The story is typical of games of the period, and riddled with cliché.\n\n\nWhile from an outside glance it would seem practically dead and unsupported, there is a hard-working team at http://wiki.arx-libertatis.org that have been patching the game since 2011, with the most recent Dev version being\nreleased on their site in Dec 2015!

Luckily, I got a free and simple mod called Arx Liberatis, and now it runs fun.  However, my steam account still only says I’ve played 20 minutes, while in reality I’ve lost many a fond hour crawling around in here.\n\nArx Fatalitis is a very old school dungeon crawler.  Despite being over a decade old, it looks ‘not bad’, and boasts a very immersive and claustrophobic atmosphere that harkens back to the early 90s era of PC roleplaying games.  It feels very, how should I say, ‘beardy’, in that it is not action-packed (combat is very clunky too) but instead you have use logic and reason to solve problems.  It is a slow paced game, but that slow pace is just brilliant.  You actually feel drawn into the subterranean world of Arx and invested in its existence as you mince down musty mines and goblin fortresses.  There’s a fair amount of camp too, especially in the dialogue, but again that camp suits the game brilliantly.  My favourite is a goblin chef with a sleazy French accent.\n\nHowever, let it also be said that Arx is not a game which holds your hand.  You always have a clear objective, but it is not always easy to find out how to accomplish it.  Also, the game is packed with secrets and optional content, but it will take a careful and thoughtful eye to notice most of it.\n\nAs for criticisms, well, the only one that really stood out was that the combat (after playing Skyrim especially) is chunkier than clunky clunk-dom.  This makes it challenging, sure, but I miss the fluidity and responsiveness of Skyrim.  Second, the maps down really tell you were the exits lead to; if I didn’t play the game for a few days I’d be hopelessly lost and couldn’t remember how to get back to some places I’d been to before.\n\nAll in all, for the paltry £2 I paid for this, Arx Fatalitis is brilliant game, the kind we don’t really see anymore.  If you like old school PC rpgs and don’t mind the clunky combat, give it a go.\n","January 16, 2015","true","0.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

The game takes place in a world that might have once been a traditional fantasy setting, but the death of the planet's sun led the various races of the world to move into various underground cave systems, with Arx being the one that the game takes place in. The open world is somewhat like a dungeon crawler, and while it may seem like a small world at first you may be surprised as you unravel it and unlock its various depths and passages. It makes up for its size by being very compact, without the filler that most modern RPGs have. There are also various civilizations to deal with, with the humans living on the top level and various other races living deeper in the caves. Arx is full of secrets and side quests, and for the most part you're free to look for them at any time. The story is fairly simple, but it never chains you to it, instead opting to just leave you to go through things at your own pace.\n\nGameplay-wise, things are pretty similar to Arcane's later games. You can specialize in stealth, combat, or magic, along with other skills like the ability to identify enchated weapons and armor. The magic system is one that you'll either love or hate; you learn spells by learning runes found on stones throughout the world and combining them into spells by drawing the runes on your screen with the mouse, and when it works it's a really cool system, but the rune detection sometimes refuses to cooperate, so you'll probably want to keep your three pre-casted spell slots full in case of combat. There are lots of item crafting mechanics you can use, and they're all presented in a more interactive way than most games' menus, like how cooking food requires you to light a fire with a spell and drop your food items into the fire until it finishes cooking, which is pretty fun in a way that's hard to describe.\n\nIt's hard to describe exactly what it is about Arx Fatalis that makes it so great, because it's a game that's made great by the various moments and sidequests that make up the game instead of by the actual core mechanics and if I listed all of my favorite parts of the game here it would just be spoiling things. But everything about it comes together so well that the only reason I wouldn't recommend it is if you aren't very good with older control schemes. Even though it's old, there's a fan patch called Arx Libertatis that fixes things up to run on modern machines, and with the game's current $5 price I think it's a steal. It's an immersive and unique game that has a kind of magic to it that even Arcane's own later games haven't quite managed to capture.","May 9","true","24.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

Though, a similar chemical reaction ensues when listening to a classical tune, both offering different euphoric feelings and ideas.\n\nI could say the same about Arx Fatalis..no, no coulds..IT IS a breath of fresh air from days gone by. In my younger years when I was installing Gothic 2, I noticed a demo game on the finalization of the install, it was distracting sight, filled with doubts and hesitation for the naive me. While there are many ideas of marketing a game, I have to thank JoWooD for their straightforward offer of giving me a demo game that not only it would annoy me, but it would also bolster some of my idyllic love for the gaming experience.\n\nIn my Gothic review, I explain how deep my bond became with the series, and ironically, the game that was a demo in the former's install, would bolster even further my sense of creation of worlds and sights undescribable.\n\nSupposedly, a medieval world(prolly high fantasy, before it's fall) and especially, a kingdom, were "blessed" by the glorious fall of the sun from the majestic. Such, the eternal winter came over all souls, forcing them into retrat in the underground mines, dug deeply under the earth. A world trapped beneath the very rock of the earth, a world torn asunder by rivaling kingdoms of Men, goblins and trolls alike. A world that cuddled itself in cheap booze, fishing,sculpting,  small talk in a grim tavern A world haunted by the eerie moan of the cold winds of the abyssal dark sky on the surface from which it travelled through all the ducts of Arx.\n\nAnd in this underground kingdom rose a bloody cult, shrouded by secrecy, divine sacrifices and bloodied sharp tools with a little tint of ceremonial caves. This cult drew the attention of the celestial guardians that oversaw the balance of all worlds. Concerned with the safety of Arx and all neighbouring kingdoms, they sent YOU to investigate this rising blight. Be warned though, a grim world awaits you, of tired torches, gorging dark halls and secrets long forgotten. Be steafdast and do not linger, the gears of war and despair are turning for this world and you may not be able to stop if it's too late..","May 28, 2013","true","20.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

First, download the patch Arx Libertatis in order to make this game compatable and fix virtually all the bugs in the game. Don't be fooled by the amount of hours Steam says I played because I easily put over 60 hrs into the Arx Libertatis mod. That said, this game is amazing! You are thrust into this immersive and highly detailed world and have to survive while uncovering a sinister plot. This game's story, characters, and atmosphere are superb. The clunky controls do little to hinder the fun I had with this game. It is a game where you actually have to figure things out and discover hidden secrets and riddles. The magic system is so unique and very thematic. In order to cast a spell, you draw on the screen the symbols of runes you have aquired. So many different possibilites can arise out of a combat scenario and the interaction between yourself, objects, and the world is like no other game. If you want to cook food (and you have to so you dont starve), then simply put some raw food next to fire and wait until its cooked. The voice acting is superb and the interesting and creative world is definatly worth exploring. I highly recommend this game. The combat and controls take a little getting used to but once you jump that hurdle you unlock a charming game that you won't want to put down.","October 30, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In order to cast a spell, you have to learn runes, and then draw the rune in the air using the mouse. There is an option to precast 3 spells that can later be cast at the press of a key for combat or cast on the fly so you don't have to stop and draw in the middle of battle to draw.\nYou can also mix items together to make new things, drop food on a campfire to cook it, ect. Its definately from an era before the "bug budget cookie cutter dumbed down RPGS" that exist now days. For only 5$, you cant go wrong. I woulda happily twice that or more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flametrooper/recommended/1700/","Flametrooper","Jade.Wu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flametrooper/","190 products in account","ARX LIBERTATIS WAS USED - Thus game time was not counted by steam. My playthrough was ~22hrs. Arx Libertatis gets the game running on nearly all systems, I suggest it if you can't run the game normally.\nArx Fatalis was created by ArKane Studios who would eventually bring the world titles such as Dark Messiah of Might & Magic (one of my favorite games) and more recently Dishonored 1 and 2 through Bethesda publishing.\n\nThe setting for the game is one of the most interesting I've seen in an RPG that is nearly untouched by the actual game. The premise is that the sun for the world has been extinguished and the surface is now uninhabitable. Anyone who goes to the surface would freeze instantly type of deal. The humans (with the help of naga-creatures) along with other races fled to the underground and through tunnels the population of the world continues to survive (Metro 2033 anyone?). Arx Fatalis takes place in Arx, one of what's considered to be 'safer' areas. This was disappointing since it was more tame setting than I wanted compared to the Travelers guild and how they're in a daily life or death struggle continuing through tunnels that are riddled with monsters.\n\nThe crux of the matter on this game is that it's hard for me to pick a side on recommending it. I'm half-heartedly going with a No Recommendation despite thinking the game isn't that bad. There just wasn't enough to push me over to wanting to replay the game or encourage someone else to go through it.\n\nTo explain, the combat (the main portion of what this game will consist of) is pretty garbage (TES style). You're forced into either building as a hybrid or into a mage only and while you can pull off the warrior build it's highly inefficient along with the worse builds of rogue or archer. The spellcasting in the game is an amazing concept that not even the game was able to do properly. You must create the runes in the air manually in a correct combination to cast the spell. Anyone who hasn't played would think it hard to do in combat BUT the player can have up to THREE precast spells. This means mages can play with the runes until they get the three spells they want and easily murder any opponent with probably only two of the spells used. Fighting with melee weapons is a chore in comparison, as swinging wildly does next to no damage. The player must 'hold' the weapon until the gauge is full and then release to deal impactful damage (~5s per swing). While this won't seem apparent initially, when the player reaches the Ylsids that run slightly faster and can swing 3 times as fast, it'll spell your doom.\nAs a new player this was especially annoying since the runes recieved early on were practically useless, and a useful spell isn't learned until later in the game which encouraged me to stay mostly melee instead of a focus on spellcraft which ends up the far better of the two.\n\nNow to me what is the real dilemma I have with the game. MECHANICS.\nThis game is a perfect example of the once and done feature. They place mechanics that exist in the game for the sole purpose of one point and then abandon the feature forever. This is excrutiating as a new player and people who played this perviously looking back with fond memories need to understand what I'm talking about. Mostly this is due a lack of both not showing and not telling what the player should do.\nJust uh.. Spoilers from here on out\n\n===SPOILERS===\nThere's a section in the game where a monster chases you upon entering the dwarf area, as you run away slamming on doors you'll cross a lava section and then find a dwarf with a key, power stone and meat. You'll probably grab the key and powerstone then run back in a panic to open the door with the monster on your heels down a corridor. If you run to the right you'll instantly game over. If you're too slow in any of the above sections, also instant game over. You then run into an empty-ish room with a ladder and hop up with glee. But now you're stuck.\nHere's the solution: You were supposed to grab that meat (which looked identical to Rat Meat i.e. nonimportant unless you mindlessly loot), run into the room and use the power stone on the blank looking box that powers the stomper above you and lure the monster underneath to get squished.\nLiterally WHAT. Like okay if the game had shown the power crystals earlier, it would be fair. If it had shown the stomper rising up from the ground, also fair game. But the fact of the matter was the whole section was like playing that stupid Train Minigame in Mario Party of RIGHT OR LEFT. Oh wrong way! Off the cliff you go!\nThis is the whole game in bringing up new concepts to the player.\n===The wine into the dough was the only one DONE RIGHT. It showed the goblin cook time and time again bringing pies to the king, if you found his diary it said he was allergic to wine, and then also finding all the wine next to the dough in the kitchen.\n===The magic lever that appeared when the monster was chasing you again? BAD.\n===Temple of Illusions? MIXED (mostly the stupid reveal on the switches; the crystal ball with the switches where you had to compare shadows in each room which would have been fine had the switches made a 'failure' sound if you messed up.)\n===Levitating into the Ice Caves? Dumb as all hell\nThe funniest thing is that in the ice caves the player character actually kind of gives advice on knocking down a stalactite to proceed forward while in all the other situations has no info to offer.\n===Crypt (pickaxing the graves out of nowhere, rune slabs, stupid sun puzzle. The hint was terrible and the way the puzzle was positioned throws everyone off, rune slabs couldve been removed since it was used in the same puzzle in the same format but only existed to torture anyone who somehow missed a single slab.)\nAlso kind of randomly; gold was relatively worthless. Best armor and weapon obtained free of charge.\n\nBut it's not as though the game was entirely misdirected\nCooking food was neat, spellcasting (despite precast ruining everything) was a good concept, and the whole staking the vampire ghouls in the crypt was a nice inclusion you wouldn't see in most games. (Plus the setting)\nFor the time when the game came out I could see why most people would love this game.\nPersonally I don't think the game aged well, and new players would certainly have more than one problem with it.\n\nIf this game released modernly not even the most hardcore would try defending it. It would be riddled with 'this makes no sense' posts but communities exist which give older games a free pass.","May 9","false","0.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

I Have completed the game. The time is due to using the arx libertatis patch without which the game is unplayable. But steam does not count time when using it ... I have spent about 20 hours on it.\n\nI cannot recommend it to others despite its many good points such as,\n\n- Excellent atmosphere\n- Interesting setting\n- Good basic game play\n\nThe problem is, that even with the well made fan patch Arts Libertatis it suffers from an amazing amount of annoyances and half-broken/half-working mechanics, examples,\n\n- The magic system is drawing of runes on the screen. The problem is that the game has miserable recognition of what you draw and even after your 20th spell cast, you'll often have to retry 2, 3, 4 or 10 times.\n- You can lose or sell quest objects and they have no tags, yep, sell or drop items, discover 2 mins before that you needed them for final door to last boss (not a joke, keep your akbaa stones).\n- You have to suffer through an amazing amount of half messed up content, including tricky map, bad quest log, endless corridors for no reason, one weapon for ranged, yep, one, bad as in really bad stealth, and amazing overpowered magic (hello fireball on anything) except when it is totally underpowered (want to cast non-precast spell in combat, ooh we are sorry, please redraw your runes while getting wailed at), aand in quick order, stuck mobs, stuck bosses, puzzles that decide to ignore you (ooh mithril goes into that 1cm area and everywhere else it results in a throw, funny...)\n\nEssentially it is for all nostalgi people have for it a game that sort of never made it out of a late beta and frankly it shows. If you are fanatical, slogging through it might be worth it. But though I am a pretty hard core RPG fan, it came up short when I had completed it and thought if it had been worth it.\n\nGrab something else on your wanted list instead of this.","August 27, 2015","false","0.1"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","24","46","5","1"

The magic system was really unique at the time (the magic runes are drawn in the air with mouse grestures, and new combinations unlock new spells). The crafting system, although kind of limited, makes sense because you're typically creating each ingredient seperate from one another as opposed to finding them all in the environment (take some flour and water to make dough, then take dough, a rolling pin, and some fruit to make a pie, for example). Like Dishonored your choices are determined by the actions you take throughout the game as well.\n\nIt has some annoying quirks on modern systems despite the most recent patch, so I highly recommend downloading Arx Libertatis to play it, though.","October 22, 2013","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game doesnt hold your hand. It requires you to think, and be intuitive. The spell casting was some of the most unique of its kind during those days (you draw the spell symbols in the air with the mouse).\n\nAnyway, this is a great, old school, first person, elder scrolls like rpg. Its slow paced and very detailed. If you have little to no patience, dont get this game.\n\nOne last thing. You REALLY need the free open source mod called Arx Libertatis to play this. Yes, it will run on steam, but expect REALLY long load times, framerate issues, and many other buggy things due to trying to run such an old game on modern machines. The ARx Libertatis mod basically fixes these thing, allowing it to run smooth and fast, as well as fixing tons of bug and improving the visuals. Dont play far without this mod, because it doesnt seem to work with non-mod game saves (at least from what I can tell). Best to just get it and play with it from the start.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/1700/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","Good old open world RPG dungeon crawling that feels like Ultima Underworld. The locales and story reflect this sort of atmosphere. There's a lot of stuff to do, some cool abilities to fool around with, and quests that will make the player explore almost every nook and cranny in the game. The sidequests are fun, and don't feel overly compulsory. There are a lot of interesting little puzzles peppered throughout as well, which excellently showcase the model and texture creativity allowed with the game's engine.\n\nThree complaints:\n\n1 - It's very buggy. The game crashes when I wander into the path of an NPC, which happens at least every 10 minutes. Transparent textures render as pitch-black voids. Quests can be broken. Objects and characters can get pushed through objects. Enemies can get stuck on thin air, and this was usually how I ended up beating bosses.\n\n2 - Artificial difficulty. This is not a term I typically use, but I'll make an exception here, because this game undeniably has it. The magic system is an example. I understand the need to have some kind of complex output for magic, given just how useful it is, but drawing out signs with the mouse is like doing so in Microsoft Paint. Even when I know how to do it, it takes, like, 5 tries before I create perfect shapes with the exact angles and straight lines. Meanwhile, the enemies can pinch 'em out in a matter of one or two seconds, but the enemies themselves are a different story. This is one of those games where "difficult enemy" means, that guy hits hard and has a lot of health. There's nothing wrong with strong bad guys, but making this the basis of difficulty for every boss and upper-level enemy in the game is just lazy. There is no strategy, just run in a circle until I manage to draw a perfect spell, turn around, fire it, rinse and repeat. Or, I suppose another option is to quickload until my opponent spawns in stuck and I can take my sweet time.\n\n3 - A lack of explanation. This partially works to the game's benefit, making for quests that actually feel rewarding and puzzles that feel challenging, unlike certain games (coughSkyrimcough), but this stops being fun when the game takes too many liberties with this approach. I can deal with a spell in my quest log instead of my spellbook. What I can't deal with is having certain dialogues and cutscenes postponed simply, say,  because I haven't talked to a specific NPC, despite the fact that I already had the information I needed from reading a book, but no, I have to talk this person and hear what I already know, because it will trigger the next dialogue sequence with another character I had already gone to visit in an unfruitful attempt to advance the quest! This sort of situation is where the discrepancy happens, where the player is caught between the limited information provided by the quest log, and what action needs to be taken to progress. It results in a lot of pointless running around and wasted time.\n\nOverall, I have somewhat positive feelings for the game. It's by no means perfect, but may have both the gameplay and atmosphere to appeal to more seasoned RPG players, specifically those who don't mind a few hiccups.","December 9, 2015","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The Steam version is for the most part glitch free, but the graphics have not aged well. They are from a time when for some reason, brown/green was the it thing, and poor skinning over polygon frames. The UI is still ok, and the game itself has numerous glitches that may be game stoppers for some... well many... anyone who who has played a game since 2008; I still find this to be a fantastic retro game. The gameplay is  much like exactly like Morrowind, but with a far more linear storyline, and fewer sidequests. I would go into long detail about the game itself, but it would be pointless; if you like Morrowind, and want to play a game where you can be a Mage, Warrior, or Ranger, then get Arx Fatalis. Personally, I think its worth the 5 bucks, but overall the game was not groundbreaking when it came out, and its not in retrospec a staple RPG.\nThat said, the good things about the game are this: Its sword and sorcery, its fairly fast paced, its not too short or too long, and its gererally a fun time killer... until you hit a glitch or bug.","April 27, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And you have to be able to do that to finish the game. Bumping in to people 30% of the time doees the same, or going up stairs... despite the crash worthyness of it I got a number of hours enjoyment from it and it is a very many layered game experience. Most of the puzzles are fun and interesting... a few are just pointless where it's overly laborious lever puzzles or click every pixel on an area until you get the thing you can't see and wouldn't know was there without a walkthrough. Mostly I didn't need to resort to them but when I did it was pretty much always a... you what?!!! how would you find that??!! There are a lot of different endings/options and side quests and the play is varied. The magic was an interesting idea but badly executed, you draw the magic symbols, however the character recognition is APPALLING combat casting even if you are really practiced is a joke. Additionally many of the damage spells are just a bit rubbish, however the range of options are good and you can use them in a lot of ways. Another way the game suffers is it's rules on stealth, I played a high stealth 80+ and magic. Despite having invisibility cast on myself and high stealth AND being hid in the shadows (and stationary) I still get a 'look it's him!' followed by being chopped to gobbets... Not very well done, which is a shame because the game has a lot of scope for it. I spent many happy hours creeping around casting extinguish spells on torches so I could terrorise monsters from the shadows but it only tended to work well on one hit kill monsters because despite hitting someone at range from a dark shadow in the back they automatically know exactly where you are and home in! Ducking behind a wall while your arrow was in flight would 'sometimes' allow you to avoid detection... Anyway, in a nutshell lots of interesting things to do and things to kill, quite a few frustrating gameplay things and buggy as anything but still very playable to the point where I'd be tempted to try again with a straightforward choppy character and see if the 'enchant' bug was just for this character which suggests it's a fun enough game to overlook the flaws. However as an aside I'd look up how to do some of the basics as the game provides sod all help on how to do even basic things i.e. how to pick a lock, how to combine items, how to move a stack of objects etc. etc. it's lack of instruction was apparently a 'gameplay' thing including rules on hunger... or rather no rules or indication you just have to eat food every so often or it's 'bad' but no food meter or indicator if you're keeping up with it or not... aaaaanyway yeah, but still fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/1700/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","Despite the clunkiness of the old-school controls, the premise of Arx Fatalis had me fairly interested: the sun has died and the various races have somewhat put aside old grudges in a mutual effort to convert the old dwarven mines into a habitable  environment. As such the entire game (as far as I know at least) takes place in winding tunnels between subterranian fortresses.\n\nThe first few hours were also interesting in that outside of fighting your way out of the goblin prison you start in, the game was remarkably murder-free for a fantasy RPG, with most of your efforts being aimed at trading favors for favors in the hopes of unconvering your lost memories, the only combat being defending yourself from rats and oversized spiders in the tunnels between settlements.\n\nHowever, shortly after you find out who you are and by extention the main plot of the game, this changes and for me ruined my interest in continuing to play. Not because of the murder, mind - I'm used to the notion that walking down the street in a videogame without ending a dozen thinking feeling lives is nigh impossible, and I would hope AF still keeps a nice middle ground - but because the game's combat controls are just that terrible.\n\nArx Fatalis, as mentioned earlier, takes place almost entirely in claustrophobic cave tunnels, and your melee controls are essentially limited to light attack or holding the button down for a heavy attack. No blocking, and no dodging to speak of besides walking briskly backwards in the hopes you don't back into a wall (and you will, because the entire game is tight winding tunnels).\n\nAnd the magic controls are even worse, going for the admittedly fairly unique method of casting spells by tracing runes in the air, the sort of idea that would be tailor made for motion controls if they existed when this game was published, but since they don't you're forced to try drawing them with only a rough visual guide using your mouse. Good luck trying to scribble out a three- or four-rune spell while holding down the Ctrl key while being attacked by two or three goons. In all likelihood you'll be punched to death while desperately trying to get "Yok" to register.\n\nArkane Studios, the team behind Dishonored, were also responsible for this game and it kind of shows with the intriguing worldbuilding, but it also shows how much they've grown with practice since this. If you somehow can handle the awful controls I'm sure the story is interesting, but personally I can't recommend such a nearly-unplayable mess.","September 27, 2015","false","8.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Much less openworld then Morrowind or Gothic, but its fun magic system, many secrets and mechanics makes it unique. I so wish someone would make a sequel, although its gritty graphics and animations also adds to the charm for oldschool gamers like me. However I must warn you, that the Arx Libertatis patch is a must have for this game, else it is left with serious, game breaking bugs.","August 2, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first person perspective and the claustophobic environments (the whole game is set underground) give the game a unique atmosphere. The magic system is awesome - although trying to frantically draw the proper shape in the middle of a fight can be tiresome some times, but on the other hand just learning about a new shape pays for every such moment :-). Arx Fatalis is supposedly a spiritual successor to Ultima Underworld, although personally i can't judge that. Note that the game can be a bit buggy at times, but nothing unfixable - or unavoidable if you don't stress the engine too much like jumping around in very close areas :-P.","December 9, 2010","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even with the modifications to the graphics and mechanics the game is still not fun. I understand it's an older game but other games released around the same time such as Morrowind (despite its flaws) had a much more polished look and controls.\n\nThe controls where outdated even for its time. You switch between standard first person mode and a mouse mode where you can move around objects. When trying to place or interact with objects it will take several atttempts. The on screen spell casting fails frequently no matter perfectly you move your mouse.\n\nThe environment is that of a poorly constructed network of mazes and it looks like it was left unfinished. It feels less like a world to explore and more like you got lost on a construction site with half finished buildings.\n\nBeyond the interesting story there isn't much of a reason to play this game. I could go on about the bugs but it's not worth my time. Save yourself the few dollars and go a tub or icecream or something.","June 3","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
