This is personified in Intake with its super simple yet challenging, pill popping gameplay. Intake takes some practice to master; it's a true test of your reflexes & mouse control skills. Music (although limited) keeps the adrenaline pumping & the graphics look great!\n\nHard not to become hooked as you hunt for your perfect run to Level 100. Very addictive :)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=193390647 { No Commentary - Straight Gameplay! }\n\nHere is some gameplay footage without any hype so you can make up your own mind if its something you might like. More fun in playing than spectating though :)\n\nBe sure to adjust your mouse cursor speed to get the maximum control and highest scores! If your cursor is too fast (or slow) by default the game becomes crazy hard and is not enjoyable.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","November 10, 2013","true","7.7"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"

Booms. Coin-up look and feel. Excellent game.\n\n\nIntake it's a rare gem, every single part of it in harmony with the rest, making this game an instant thumbs up. Gameplay is excellent, either you use keyboard or mouse: simple controls for quick, non-stop action. Graphics are sharp and bright colored and the interface is, for a lack of a better word in my limited vocabulary, classy. Sound effects are great and contribute to generate a really immersive experience.\n\nAnd the game's soundtrack it's glorious, making the game unique and memorable. The coin-up theme it's another plus, even more if you used to play arcade machines with the level of addictiveness and replayability that this game has. Let me tell it on more concrete terms: this game it's a good purchase for ten bucks (even if you can get it for one).\n\nThat's high praise coming from me. Well done Cipher Prime, I hope you keep making awesome games in the future.","November 9, 2014","true","5.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

Cipher Prime has always had great music in all their other games (Auditorium, Pulse, and Splice come to mind) but this is, to my knowledge, the first dubstep-centric game which they have done, and the tracks are fantastic. Plus, everyone knows that dubstep is the sound Transformers make when they are making little Transformers.\nSound effects are likewise well done and fit well with the music, so much so that listening to the soundtrack alone feels like something is missing.\nThe gameplay is simplistic and easy to comprehend, yet rewarding. You use your mouse to shoot pills, which fall from the ceiling in two colors. Your spacebar (or second mouse button) switches the color of your laser, and the game records your ongoing combo.\nThere are plenty of unlocks (new tracks and pill color combinations) and powerups to keep the game fresh through multiple playthroughs.\nIncludes both local and global scoreboards, as well as Achievements. One of those achievements is called “Double Rainbow.” Don’t throw your money at the screen so hard, you might break it.\nHas the classic “Winners Don’t Do Drugs” splash screen which took me back to my days in the arcade playing Street Fighter II.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIf you’re not a fan of dubstep/techno, you will probably not enjoy this game.\nBeing a throwback to the days of arcade games where the only objective was a higher score, there is little replay value for those who prefer storylines or need some sort of ending.\nThe game can be a little unforgiving at first, with only two or three mistakes resulting in a Game Over.\nCan you play it while the children are awake?:\n\nSure, though it won’t make any sense to them. No real violence to speak of. You may\nwant to keep your child away if they are epileptic, though the game has no specific\nwarning about this.\n\nWhile I’m picking nits…\n\nMake sure you have a good headset or earbuds to play this game with. I found it\nenjoyable both on my Turtle Beach headset and my Beats earbuds. Also, I personally\nthink Cipher Prime is an underrated studio which deserves support so they can continue\nmaking games. They just successfully kickstarted Auditorium Duet, so I am not the only\none who feels this way. Cipher Prime makes fantastic casual indie games and amazing\nmusic. Their games are money well spent no matter which one you buy.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?:\n\nI’m not sure there is any “completing it.” Remember, arcade style. I have put a couple\nof hours into it and certainly came away satisfied. Also, the soundtrack made it to my\niPod for working out.\n\nRecommended Purchase Price:\n\n$8.99 (which is the current sale price on Steam through Nov 12,). If you miss the sale,\nanother dollar to enjoy this game isn’t going to kill you.\n\nor\n\n90% of current retail value of $9.99\n\nReviewer:\n\nRod Kimble\n\nhttp://www.gamersglance.com","December 3, 2013","true","0.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"

There is a color switch system.\n- Pills come in two colors, shoot the pills of the same color or switch colors anytime)\n- Black flashbang pills to avoid\nThe gameplay has a few more subtle points: explosions push away nearby pills, pills can collide together, etc.\nAfter every short level, you get rewarded with a circle of bonus coins you have to hit quickly. CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK !\n\nTo break the monotony every once in a while,, you get a special level with one difficulty setting pushed much higher, like much more pills onscreen ("flood" levels), or less pills onscreen with a much faster falling speed.\nThis is 100% skill based and feels like a nice mouse aiming / reaction time skill test.\nI think the game is entirely procedural/randomized. It just gets harder until you eventually lose.\n\nThere are some bonuses here and them (items, unlockable) which you should have all unlocked in a few hours hours. Hopefully they do not distract too much from the gameplay (just like the special levels, they help break the monotony).\n\nAbout the graphics: they do their job. Pretty but the readibility is good, which is absolutely necessary for a fast-paced game like this. There are some nice hommages to arcade some will catch :) With some tweaks to difficulty and items, this would sure make an excellent arcade game. If arcades still existed.

If it's insanely cheap, yes. It's worth playing.\n\nI really like the first song. I've now unlocked all but one other songs and I like none of them. That's definitely a dealbreaker.\n\nThe main issue, though, is the mouse acceleration. You can adjust it, but I cannot for the life of me get it right, and there seems to be no way to actually turn it off. But perhaps you can edit an .ini file or something. Do you really want to though?\n\nIt's basically a game where you click falling pills that are one of two colors, interspersed with "challenge" levels of varying impossibility. Seriously, I have no idea how you're supposed to click pills falling at 100 kph.\n\nIt's fun for a while. The basic gameplay is good - fairly enjoyable and addictive. But when you lose because a challenge level is just impossible or poorly-explained, or, far more frustrating, because the mouse does not do what you tell it, the charm wears off, bit by mouse-accelerating bit.\n\nI couldn't find this on Google Play, so I'm confused by this game, because it feels like it's made for mobile.

Swap the color of your pointer to shoot pills of the same color. You're immune to capsules of your current color, but if one of the wrong color passes the bottom of the screen, you lose. It's a pretty amusing gimmick, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. Difficulty balance probably could have been handled better, but honestly it might have been hard to stay interested otherwise.\n\nAt first Intake seems addictive, but it's really just a placebo.

The twist is that you must flip your gun between the two colours, to match whatever it is you're shooting.\n\nSuper easy to learn, and it starts out fairly easy, but then the intensity ramps up and it's quite a workout.  Playing well rewards you with "mg" which is the in-game currency, to unlock power-ups, more lives, different themes and music.  It's an exceptionally well polished game that lasts between 2 and 5 minutes per round, and if you like fast-paced arcade games, you're probably going to love Intake!","January 26, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

'Intake' is a fast paced, highly addictive, musically-driven score attack that tests your reflexes as you struggle to save a body from certain death as pills fall from the throat of it's seemingly unhappy owner. I'm not really sure why this person is trying to end their life, perhaps they recently lost their job, or maybe they're going through a nasty divorce, or maybe'Starbucks' was just out of their favorite blend of coffee; nevertheless, it's up to us to save them.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely simple, which goes for most great games of this genre. Snap your mouse back and forth and destroy the falling pills with the coordinating colors before enough fall past you, and you die. The more pills you destroy in a row, the bigger the bonus, and the more rounds you get through, the more intense the gameplay becomes as the game throws combinations of "attacks" at you. 'Intake' takes the things that made 'Tetris' memorable and builds upon them, so you know it's good. And combining these characteristics along with the fast-paced soundtrack and upgrade system makes this game well worth the price.","March 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

But those 10 minutes are going to bring you far! One thing i recommend is taking breaks often as its fast phased, intense, and requires a steady yet fast hand aswell as eyes.\n\nIts challenging and its a lovely feature to add milestones on the waves such as 0-25-50-100 which means if you ever should get past level 25 you woulndt have to work all the way back up, you can go to the settings and make it start at level 25 :)\n\nThe lack of music tracks is what brings it a little down in grade as you only got 1 song and 2 unlockable songs, which are about 30 secs long and then repeated :/ I find my self just slapping one of my own songs on in a browser or media player and play the game W/o music ^^\n\nThe tricky parts comes in evading flashbangs (placebo) and changing colors so your crosshair's color matches the pill you want to bring to an end, as if a yellow pill falls you want to right click or press spacebar to change to the yellow color. There is 2 colors changing each round, and you can unlock a harder difficulty by unlocking 3 colors or more.\n\nThe game is enjoyable, playable and most of all replayable :)! but as i said, the major thing that drags it down is the lack of music :(\n\n8/10!","November 10, 2013","true","6.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Would probably be better as a .99 game on a tablet. Maybe that's where it came from... but I don't play tablet/phone games, so I don't know.

You click on things, while making sure your cursor is one of two colors.  I'm all for saturated, blinding VFX in the name of flavor and style, but... that's all the game has going for it.  Might as well be a screensaver.  In fact, is kind of is when the AI is playing in the menu screen.  I can't believe I have to buy (with in-game currency) my way out of that ear-bleedingly awful song.\n\nThe only relation this has to Dr. Mario is the pill theme, which is literally just there for EXTREME EDGE.  You could literally replace the pills with fruit and it would be no different except for the forced amounts of edge.\n\nAlso, why can't I just have my mouse use its normal Windows sensitivity?

Likely.\n\nTo be honest, you should get what this game is about just from the video and screenshots. Perhaps, exactly what's going on make sort of confuse you, so I'll elaborate. Intake is an drug/rave/club referencing arcade action title requiring the player to "stay alive" by destroying pills that are floating down the screen. At any given time, the pills will be of one or two colors in which will add to your combo if the game screen is in the right color. The default controls are as simple as can be: Mouse to aim, left click to shoot,  right click to swap color (besides mouse aim, you can rebind the keys in the launcher, which may actually improve performance for you for keyboard keys). If you click a pill in the wrong color, it will be destroyed, but any combo you had will be lost. You want to destroy pills before they hit the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom and your screen is the wrong color, you will lose a life. The mechanic is reminescent of Ikaruga and eXceed 2nd: Vampire Rex.\n\nWhat makes the game interesting enough to bother playing with, besides it's simple, yet addicting (no pun intended) mechanics is it's art direction. From it's sharp, modern rave club color pallete and interface to its dubstep music and clean, non-intrusive sound profile, Intake leaves you immersed in a exciting experiene.\n\nAs you clear pills, you will meet the goal of completing the level, which turns all pills on the screen into colorless tablets which can be gathered for extra Mg (Milligrams, points basically) as well as enabling an arc of tablets which can be collected for points. After earning enough Mg, next time you loose, you can buy upgrades including more music, more color pallets, invicibility bigger pills and extra lives, which will probably be the most important upgrade. Higher levels get harder as pills fall down faster, more pills spawn and black pills called Flashbangs that will stun you and temporarily blind you to pills. Eventually events occur such as a massive flood of pills or a small comet-like attack of extremely fast moving pills.\n\nIntake is extremely fun and addicting. Unfortunately, the game gets a little too hard for my skill level around the high 20's/early thirties, which is a shame because I really enjoy the game. I can see myself maybe improving a bit, but I'm not quite sure I can reach the skill level needed to go much beyond game leve 31 or so. That said, beyond the fact that I only had one track when I played (I unlocked another, but for some reason I still had the same song) I can recommend this game to basically anybody that is into arcade style games and isn't epileptic. The drug and party theme will put off the conservative and parental types, but it doesn't necessarily romanticise the use of drugs and instead is more of a theme for gameplay, much like Dr. Mario.","December 25, 2013","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The graphics are pretty awesome for a game of its size, and the constant dubstep in the background will keep you alive.  I highly recommend this game.

The game is designed to push you into a zen mode where the response to changing pill colours and powerup types is instantenous and reflexive, almost purely involuntary. The blasting electronica / dubstep, the colour variations, the gameplay premise and the "challenge levels" are a testament to that. It's like Tetris' younger brother - only instead of having you think up a solution to how to fit in the next piece as fast as possible, it requires you to make the split-second decision of whether to change your colour beam and in what order to destroy the incoming pills.\n\nTotally worth it.

Too bad the developers didn't bother to change the aspect ratio, to at least look pretty on a big screen, but then again, who knows, maybe they will.\nThe gameplay however, is quite enjoyable. At first I feared it would become repetitive quickly, but as it progressed, it test your speed more and more. Be warned though: this game was meant for mobile devices, where you do not move a mouse, but simply hit the screen. Later levels get impossibly hard, since you could normally play with, say, two thumbs, while here, we only have one mouse.\nIf you are a completist, do not buy this. You probably won't get past the second half of the game, which is impossible to follow with just a mouse. If you play on a tablet, say a Surface Pro or something, this of course won't be a problem.\nIf, like me, you're a sucker for fancy flashing graphics and fast paced gameplay, and don't care about getting 100% completion if you can get a few hours of fun out of it, go for it!","December 2, 2013","true","4.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","3"

I grabbed it awhile back before it was on Steam and loved it - how excited was I when a few months later I noticed I could activate it in my library!\n\nIt's a sleeper hit, unknown gem, whatever adjective pair you want to use to describe it is applicable.  It's well polished, addictive, and fast paced - like the best Shmups (might be why I'm so drawn to it).\n\nThe premise is simple: click on pills to make them explode.  Two colors come down at once, right click to swap between colors, build combos, and set high scores.\n\nIn execution, it gets tricky: the music is blaring, your palms are sweating, and the pills keep coming.  You click and click and click but the waves keep coming down.\n\nIt's intensely fun with superb sound design.  Speaking of which, make sure you have some solid headphones.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you had little cheapo earbuds in while you played this.  The best experience is engrossed with your nose an inch from the monitor and the EDM soundtrack and high-quality sound effects bursting your eardrums.\n\nThe visuals are really nice too.  Nothing too complex, a few particle effects and some color shadings but the game pulls it together into a great, color popping aesthetic.\n\nAs for settings options, for an indie game this guy is packed full of them.  Full featured color-blind modes, "gartnervision", which gives background to the landscape mode the game is set in, a full suite of upgrades to unlock and turn on and master, even different game modes and challenges including a "No Nonsense" mode which cuts out bonus levels and keeps you in the heat of things longer and at a faster pace.  You can really tell with the available settings, options, and unlocks that the developers really cared about this game and took the time to polish all the edges - even the flavor text for your power ups has funny little quips that fit the theme of the game.\n\nDon't miss this one.  I'd recommend it for just about any gamer with a love for pulse-pounding action, especially if you want something to pick up for short period of time play...if you can put it down.\n\n-Be Aggressive.\n\nP.S. - the quality of the soundtracks in the game is very high - the review video on Steam doesn't do it justice.  You'll see what I mean the first time you load it up or you can compare it to the HQ video on their webiste: http://playintake.com/\n\nYou can also check out the soundtrack at their store page: http://music.cipherprime.com/album/intake-ost\n(Hint: if you like the music, you'll love the game - the songs are even better with explosions)","May 28, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quick, colorful, and extremely arcade-like. You're gathering points here, not trying to save the world. Intake embraces the dubstep/club plus drug culture. Maybe it doesn't, since you're 'shooting' the drugs.\n\nEither way, it's a nice little puzzle game.\n\n","June 8, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunatsely there's no option to have the game render in a more vertical-orientated resolution for those of us with vertical monitors in our setup or with our main monitor having a good enough stand to be turned vertically easily. Instead the window hogs up unessecary horizontal space that's just a blur of the game action.

I grabbed it awhile back before it was on Steam and loved it - how excited was I when a few months later I noticed I could activate it in my library!\n\nIt's a sleeper hit, unknown gem, whatever adjective pair you want to use to describe it is applicable.  It's well polished, addictive, and fast paced - like the best Shmups (might be why I'm so drawn to it).\n\nThe premise is simple: click on pills to make them explode.  Two colors come down at once, right click to swap between colors, build combos, and set high scores.\n\nIn execution, it gets tricky: the music is blaring, your palms are sweating, and the pills keep coming.  You click and click and click but the waves keep coming down.\n\nIt's intensely fun with superb sound design.  Speaking of which, make sure you have some solid headphones.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you had little cheapo earbuds in while you played this.  The best experience is engrossed with your nose an inch from the monitor and the EDM soundtrack and high-quality sound effects bursting your eardrums.\n\nThe visuals are really nice too.  Nothing too complex, a few particle effects and some color shadings but the game pulls it together into a great, color popping aesthetic.\n\nAs for settings options, for an indie game this guy is packed full of them.  Full featured color-blind modes, "gartnervision", which gives background to the landscape mode the game is set in, a full suite of upgrades to unlock and turn on and master, even different game modes and challenges including a "No Nonsense" mode which cuts out bonus levels and keeps you in the heat of things longer and at a faster pace.  You can really tell with the available settings, options, and unlocks that the developers really cared about this game and took the time to polish all the edges - even the flavor text for your power ups has funny little quips that fit the theme of the game.\n\nDon't miss this one.  I'd recommend it for just about any gamer with a love for pulse-pounding action, especially if you want something to pick up for short period of time play...if you can put it down.\n\n-Be Aggressive.\n\nP.S. - the quality of the soundtracks in the game is very high - the review video on Steam doesn't do it justice.  You'll see what I mean the first time you load it up or you can compare it to the HQ video on their webiste: http://playintake.com/\n\nYou can also check out the soundtrack at their store page: http://music.cipherprime.com/album/intake-ost\n(Hint: if you like the music, you'll love the game - the songs are even better with explosions)","May 28, 2014","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The bass drops are sick and in sync with what's happening in gameplay, the colors and graphics are fantastic, and the in-game "Drug Store" makes upgrades and personalized experiences worth it!\n\n"Addicting" in every way possible!","November 15, 2013","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(pills)\n\nAn upgrade tree to spend your hard earned mg (currency) on makes it sort of a roguelike. Definitely would recommend.","May 26, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wanted to see what kind of people wouldn't like this game. those 24 (at the tiem of this post) bad reviews were mostly "too quick", "bad music" and "not worth $10". It's been a while, but I dont think I payed $10 for thsi game, which would be fine if I did, i love it. But it is a great game; simple to learn but hard to master. I highly recommend it.","June 27, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the player does is click on coloured pills to the beat of the background music.\n\nLENGTH / REPLAY VALUE = 5\nIndividual games are rather short but this game is addictive, like the pills.\n\nGRAPHICS = 7\nInteresting art style, although the game is letterboxed (with a background to fill the screen)\n\nFRAME RATE = 10 (60+ FPS)\nThe average gamer should have no frame rate issues. There is no frame-rate cap.\n\nCONTROLS = 10\nThe controls are simple but in faster moments, they can get confusing - Leading to hilarious moments where your sitting their slapping yourself for pressing space to switch colours 1 second too early.\n\nVALUE FOR MONEY = 3\nI think that US$10 is too much for what's basically a glorified mobile game.\n\nMUSIC = 5\nAre there any more songs other than that "Be Aggressive" song? Because that song gets annnoying quickly.\n\nDLC / FREEMIUM / PAY2WIN = N/A\nThere is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DLC or Microtransactions.\n\nASSET FLIPPING = N/A\nI couldn't see any uncredited, undisclosed misappropriated assets\n\nOVERALL = 6/10\nThis game is recommended if you can pick this up during a sale or in a Humble Bundle.","July 16, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is fun especially with the soundtrack and fantastic visuals although very challenging. Intake is a fun game however the game can get repetitive very quickly, but for a small price, you will enjoy a game about taking drugs and freaking out\n\nDon't do drugs kids!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","April 28","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
