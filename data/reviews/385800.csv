"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roserin/recommended/385800/","Roserin","❤Roserin❤MissTaxi❤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Roserin/","978 products in account","Nekopara Vol. 0 is the prequel to the events that occur in Nekopara Vol. 1.\n\nStoryThe story is pretty much outlined in the description on the steam store.\n"The eldest daughter of the Minaduki household and their 6 catgirls go to wake up their master; prepare breakfast; clean up the house; go out on a walk; make dinner; take a bath; sleep together; et cetera, et cetera. "\nSadly it outlines the majority of what this visual novel has to offer, which can be a bit of a spoiler, but the interactions and personality of the catgirls does offer some light comedy. Their differing personalities, as well as their curuiosity, does lead to them to sometimes being more troublesome than helpful. This being said, the visual novel is a bit short, and can be fully read in about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on your reading speed.\n\nNotable features-As you all may have noticed, there is a hand on the top right of the screen while playing the game, pressing it engages in a petting "minigame". This minigame pauses the game's dialogue, allowing you to pet the characters on screen. This is not limited to the catgirls, you can even pet shigure. The petting feature goes a bit further, making the characters react differently; based on where you choose to pet them.\n-Trading cards with more cute backgrounds and emoticons.\n-Artwork is similar to that of its predecessor, having some scenes played out in their adorable chibi form, and many other scenes in their normal form. Art is a bit more lewd, as it has a shower scene with shigure as well as the catgirls.(use your imagination)\n\nVerdict 7/10\n\nAt the time of this review, there is a small typo, in which Maple asks Coconut if she is sure she can finish all the food she wanted, but refers to her as cinnamon.\n\nIF you enjoyed this review, please feel free to follow our curator here.","August 17, 2015","true","137.2"," 371 of 405 people (92%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","92","371","405","50","19"

I reckon my boyfriend would have some concern if he saw me spending much longer ogling at animated cat girls bosoms bouncing around at the slightest movement, so the length suited it quite well.\nI am aware there is a sequel/sequels, however the higher price tag for these titles (Even if they were longer in story etc) wouldn't be justifiable for me simply because of lack of depth to the story itself. I would therefore advise only buying the heavier priced sequels if they are on sale, or if you have a particular craving for catgirl ecchi.","October 10, 2015","true","3.7"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","92","49","53","13","2"

Their first title was World End Economica episode.01, released in June 2014. Sekai Project has used the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter to fund many of their projects. In November 2014, they launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund an English release of the visual novel Clannad. The campaign exceeded its goal of US$140,000 and ended up raising over US$500,000.[3] In July 2015, Sekai Project announced that they would be localizing manga in addition to video games, starting with Gate.[4]\nSekai Project has stated that they are interested in localising games into languages other than English in future. The German translator Marcel Weyers, who has already translated a number of visual novels into German, has voiced interest in translating titles by Sekai Project and is supposedly in talks with the company.[5][6]\nSince Steam does not typically allow adult games to be sold on their platform,[7] Sekai Project releases their adult titles through their partner company Denpasoft. For titles like The Fruit of Grisaia, an all ages version is available on Steam, while the uncut adult version is sold directly through the Denpasoft website.[8 Nekopara is a visual novel series, so the majority of the gameplay consists of the player reading the game's story. Nekopara does not offer choices to the player throughout gameplay, and the player has no influence over the story. The games are fully voiced (except for the protagonist) and use a system called "E-mote" that allows the in-game characters to be animated, instead of stationary sprites.[2] Nekopara Vol. 0 added a new feature where the player can click on characters in-game, to "pet" them. The characters will react in different ways depending on where the player pets them Vol .0 The eldest daughter of the Minazuki household and their 6 catgirls go to wake up their master; prepare breakfast; clean up the house; go out on a walk; make dinner; take a bath; sleep together; et cetera, et cetera.Enjoy a page from the leisurely, daily lives of Shigure and the Minazuki household's catgirls! The story starts as Shigure wakes up Chocola and Vanilla and proceeds to wake up Kashou. As they enter his room, he was nowhere to be found and Shigure assumes he left to practice his baking.\n\nMy opinion :\n\nNEKOPARA Vol. 0 and very short but very interesting with a decent history of the game nekopara Vol .1 shoed you spend a good time in the company band character coughs a more interest than the other games when your mechanical remains simple but effective there is not much to say about his there is not much to say about his title-penny follow the story and little kawaii Foley .Fat has NEKOPARA Vol. 0 or even any visual novel courtyard basic Japanese . I'm just disappointed that we did not make interactive choices draws one can learn .\n\nThème :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhS6NbMAh4s\n\nConclusion :\nI recommend this game for the simple fact that it's still a good visual novel and serte and yard but do not ask you to spend all your money in there also make steam nekopara profile that are not bad but that costs quite expensive for a badge . I really advice you and Party 2 and scheduled for February 20","January 5","true","006.1"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","26","34","3","0"

My friend decided that he should get this game for me to play. I was like "oh hell no, this is some weeaboo trash ♥♥♥♥", not only was I right but I was so right that I got a tumor in my brain. As I started to play through this game I realized the potential I had, that potienal I used to perform seppeku. I guess there is just some 40 year old men that like to get off to this stuff. Since I found out there are some easy achievements I just blew by the game but I came by one particular scene that caught my eye, the bathing scene. At that point I knew that I had hit hell, or beyond if possible. I hit that special place in hell that Jared from Subway had managed to find his way to. If you are considering buying this game ask yourself this "do you want be exposed to nude 12 year old animated japanese girls?, do you have absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing life and instead of finding a girlfriend you want to spend the rest of your miserable life jacking off to nude japanese anime girls?" if your answer to both of those is yes then you probably should buy this game, and reevaluate your life. 6.9/10 would go back and watch that bathing scene again","August 31, 2015","true","0.6"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","73","27","37","31","0"

Episodes are different - some of them I find boring but some are quite fun ^_^ However, do not expect too much - it is a merely fan-disk to Nekopara Vol. 1. But unlike Vol.1 this game doesn't focus solely on Chocola and Vanilla and seems to not have any problems with Windows 8 compatibility.\nSo you definitely should get this game if:\n1. you are a fan of Nekopara series or into nekos*\n2. you like anyone of the presented heroines*\n3. you want anime cards/backgrounds\n\n*This game also has an interesting feature to pet nekos and play with their tummy and breasts. Quite relaxing thing... I mean petting! ^_^"\n\nP.S. Nice fact: the game costs only 2.99$ while 4 cards you get can be easily sold for about 4-8$.

What's so great about Nekopara is the engine it's made in, you are not being presented the story with static images of the characters, the characters are animated. You see them blinking, talking and walking in and out of the screen, that alone makes it much better experience and allows you to feel more for the characters. Followed by a nice soundtrack, it's the same OST from vol.1 and the music sometimes jumps from the "sad/emotional" to "happy/energetic" weirdly and too often IMO but it's not a major issue. The drawings are yet again top notch and high quality, both the backgrounds and the characters themselves. Voice acting is 10/10 as well and only adds up to the overall atmosphere the game presents you.\n\nThere's no real gameplay, you just read through it, no multiple endings or choises. Nothing like that. But to be fair I didn't even expect it to be here I hope to see something like that in Vol.2. There's not much on the story department neither, you just follow an ordinary day for a family that has way too many catgrils which can take care of any excitement any day of the year it seems. I've had quite a few laughs out of this and that's all I could ask for.\n\nAll in all, this is a great VN to get you started with the nekopara franchise. You'll get to see just how much love the devs put into this, it continues to be one of the best VN series out there. If you like what you see here, I'd advise you to get vol.1, there's a nice little story there, it lasts longer and gets more emotional.\nIf you are into visual novels OR looking to get into them, I'd really recommend this one. It's lovely, it's cute and yes even a bit lewd. A nice little package of "what more could I possibly want?" here. I know what, I want more Nekopara!","August 17, 2015","true","1.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/recommended/385800/","manicado","Meownic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manicado/","271 products in account","Nekopara! A day in the life of a catgirl (or well, several!). Nekopara Volume 0 was developed by NEKO WORKs and published by Sekai Project on the 17th August 2015. There are currently three games to the series – Volume 0, 1 and 2.\n\nNekopara Volume 0 was released after Volume 1 but the game is set before the events of Volume 1. Volume 0 is set in a third person perspective, meaning you personally have very little interaction in terms of the story input. You can however pet the girls which is quite adorable.\n\nPositives:\nMusic – The music to the main menu and game is really enjoyable. It’s quite upbeat and I feel it goes very well with the game.\nPrice – The price of this game is very low, at £1.99 it is not much money at all to invest.\nNeko Paradise – If you love Cat girls, you won’t be left disappointed. They are however a bit silly but that adds to the cuteness of it all.\nOptimisation – The game is heavily customisable. You can change the font of the text, speed of the text, languages, window size and the most amusing “chest bounciness”.\nSave slots – There are a huge amount of save slots, I’ve found in previous VN’s the number of save slots have been pretty low, Nekopara however provides a huge amount.\nArtstyle – The artstyle to the game is really good, very sharp with bright radiant colours. There are also a few slides where the game turns chibi and the result is very adorable.\nPetting – this is more of a side amusement, you can pet the girls whenever you feel like.\n\nNegatives:\nLength – The length of the game is really short and will see you completing it in around 1 hour and 30 minutes (well probably quicker than that because I move really slow)\nThird person perspective – There was times in which I wish I could’ve been a person in the story and be able to participate and make choices and choose favourites. Unfortunately this game takes more of a viewers point where you can’t make changes what so ever.\nCensorship – The game has certain parts (Ehehehe) censored. I am against censorship because I believe it ruins artistic freedom. Although I do agree that the game should be restricted to adults only.\nLoss of facial expressions – When they are angry, if you pet them suddenly they lose their angry facial expressions which can leave it looking a bit derpy.\nNo choices – Any choices in the game would be great but unfortunately you have none.\n\n\nVolume 0 is the first ever Nekopara game I have played and it felt more like a taster because of the price and the length of the game. I did however enjoy the game because it was filled with nekos and silliness. This game may not be for everyone, especially due to it being AO and culturally different. I am looking forward to playing Volume 1 after this game because I feel the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and for the price of this game, it’s definitely worth checking out to see if you do enjoy it because if you do, you have another two nekopara games to check!\n\nScore: Buy now","February 29","true","2.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","0"

The soundtrack in this novel includes quite a few songs from the soundtrack of Volume 1, which is comforting and also familiar, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel they simply renovated it and brought in a few changes to the OST, while also keeping true to the style.\n\nPros:\nYou can pet your cats.\nYou can make your cats boobs bounce.\nGreat writing that will keep you involved.\nFamiliar and comforting soundtrack.\nMany of the CGs include all of the cats, and it's in true Sayori style.\n\nNeutral:\nShort length, which is really helpful for staying involved but it can also be a bit of a shame that it ends so quickly.\n\nCons:\nI can't really think of any major cons, actually, maybe it's just because I've known of Chocola and Vanilla since 2010 so anything involving them is something I absolutely adore.","August 17, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Each character has a very adorable voice to speak to you as they move about in a 3D motion. It's also nice to be able to pat them on the head and show affeciton to them.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe game helps people kinda feel a connection to the characters with a smart move of adding the 3D effects, interation options and also having their cheery voices talk to you allat the same time!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI recommend this game to people who would like to see what NEKOPARA Vol.1 would be like to play, Please keep in note that the game can become NSFW in some parts! So if you like anime girls, nekomimis, and being loved by both anime girls who are nekomimis then go right ahead and play this adorable game!\n-MWS","October 21, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Most people think these games are for nerds who have no real life experience with people, but they are WRONG! Playing this game gave me the courage to go out to the local 7-11 and ask the sales associate where the condoms are. This game gave me the courage and the belief that I too will one day lay my fair lady down in bed, and do the deed.\n\nWe will start a family, and name our child Cinnamon, we will also have 4 cats, and a honda civic. Our child will grow up watching Naruto, and for halloween she will go as the dinosaur they call Zard. She will get bullied at first as a young child, but within time we will show her that there is more to life than a 9-5 job. There are flowers, fedoras, and okcupid. Love is real, and one day we will all be lucky to experience it with the one we dream about.\n\nThis game. This game has changed my life. If I could, I would review this game infinite out of 10, but alas, I am unable to, so instead, I will have to give it the top score limit that society has allowed us, 10... out of 10.\n\n\nIf you love this game, and other games, be sure to join this steam group -> http://steamcommunity.com/groups/metamemes .\n\nThere is place for all of us to rejoice about the good life without the worry of bullies.

It's (literally) Nekopara, but better than the first one.\n\nFull review:\nIf you've come here before having read volume 1, you messed up. Read volume 1 first, or alternatively, my review of it.\n\nNow, if you have read volume 1, you know exactly what to expect. If you just want to finish reading what you started, you probably won't be able to follow to well, but thanks nonetheless.\n\nAs far as the story goes, I found this one a tad more interesting than its predecessor, although the fact that it only covers a single day chronologically means that you're going to be reading for an hour and then idling for trading cards for the next 10 like I did. It's still the same deal, catgirls and not much happening, but we get a bit more backstory on the other catgirls and Shigure, which is welcome in my eyes. Kashou being basically a non-factor in this game was also a nice addition. I don't really like that guy.\n\nThe story is one reason I'd recommend this and volume 1, but there are two much more significant factors that influence this preference.\n\nFirstly, Neko Works has really stepped up their game engine since the last installment. There's now a feature to pet the catgirls at any time, as long as their sprite is on the screen, and they even have three different reactions depending on where you pat them. This is a pretty neat toy which adds to the main selling point of the game - the cutesiness.\n\nAlso, the option to display dialogue from two languages, which was a little bugged in volume 1, if I recall correctly, now works more or less fine. Although it cuts off a little on some of the longer lines, it's definitely workable. This feature is great for people looking to practice Japanese, especially considering the game isn't too long and doesn't use particularly difficult language.\n\nAs for the English translation, I was (surprisingly) rather impressed. If it was done by the same guy as the first game, you did good, friend. There's still a fair bit of room for work, but considering this is a Sekai Project release, the fact that it's up to scratch is an improvement. There was one mistake in the English dialogue - writing Cinnamon instead of Coconut - which isn't really anything major, but it rustled my jimmies nonetheless. It would be nice if it got patched but I don't really care any more since I'm never going to play the game again anyway.\n\nThe other thing that led me to hitting the recommend button on this game was its price. Volume 1 was a little pricey considering how much you got out of it, but this volume, costing as much as a cup of coffee, is marketed at a much more reasonable price point, and I really don't have a reason not to recommend it.","December 12, 2015","true","11.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game is very short, in fact, you could finish the entire game before you even get a card drop. The achievements are pretty easy to 100% too. (PETTING SIMULATOR! Check my guide) Nekopara Vol. 0 is more of an intro for the actual game. (Nekopara Vol. 1) as the steam store description say, this is just a fandisc. The story portrays how the six cats and their master's little sister live an average day. That's pretty much it.\n\nRatings[ + ] Boobs physics! (Yes, top of the list)\n[ + ] Very good art with smooth animations included.\n[ + ] Despite it having a really short story, the visual novel itself has a well-built foundation. (gallery, cozy settings, petting feature etc.)\n[ + ] Steam add-ons (Achievements, and Cards)\n[ = ] Very short. It is a prequel I know, but it could still use some improvement especially since this is being sold as different game.\n[ - ] Lack of plot. The story has no depth.

"\nSadly it outlines the majority of what this visual novel has to offer, which can be a bit of a spoiler, but the interactions and personality of the catgirls does offer some light comedy. Their differing personalities, as well as their curuiosity, does lead to them to sometimes being more troublesome than helpful. This being said, the visual novel is a bit short, and can be fully read in about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on your reading speed.\n\nNotable features\n-As you all may have noticed, there is a hand on the top right of the screen while playing the game, pressing it engages in a petting "minigame". This minigame pauses the game's dialogue, allowing you to pet the characters on screen. This is not limited to the catgirls, you can even pet shigure. The petting feature goes a bit further, making the characters react differently; based on where you choose to pet them.\n-Trading cards with more cute backgrounds and emoticons.\n-Artwork is similar to that of its predecessor, having some scenes played out in their adorable chibi form, and many other scenes in their normal form. Art is a bit more lewd, as it has a shower scene with shigure as well as the catgirls.(use your imagination)\n\nVerdict 7/10\n\nAt the time of this review, there is a small typo, in which Maple asks Coconut if she is sure she can finish all the food she wanted, but refers to her as cinnamon.\n","September 12, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This takes place before Vol. 1, before Kashou moved to open the bakery. There's no real central plot, it's just showcasing an average day in the Minaduki's house.\n\nYou might of noticed it's only 3 dollars. Real cheap, but that means it's very short. I read the whole thing in less than an hour, so keep that in mind.\n\nAnything I said in my review of Vol. 1 basically applies here. It's cute, silly, lighthearted fun with all the characters performing their daily activites they would normally do; make food, going out, etc etc. Chocola and Vanilla aren't really the main stars anymore as all 6 of the catgirls share the spotlight now, making sure they all have their moments within the story, along with Shigure from time to time. Kashou isn't even in the story, so he's not focused on at all. While it may seemed pretty cramped to try to focus on 6 characters, you really do get to see the personalities of all the catgirls shine in one way or another, and you really get a feel for them more, certainly more than you saw in Vol. 1 (Besides Chocola and Vanilla, they kind of took a backseat) Basically, it's still got the nice writing and tone that the last one had, if you liked Vol. 1, you'll feel right at home here.\n\nThere's no real difference in the animation or music department, it's all the same from Vol. 1, but luckily it's still fully animated and voice acted in Japanese just like the last one.\n\nThere's a petting mode. You can pet anyone you like at (almost) anytime. So that's good.\n\n\nSo overall, Vol. 0 is a really short but sweet experience that gives you more to read if you wanted to have more Nekopara. If you haven't played Vol. 1 yet, go pick this up first since it's cheaper and you can get an idea of all the characters and how they are.\n\n7/10","August 17, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Nekopara does not offer choices to the player throughout gameplay, and the player has no influence over the story. The games are fully voiced (except for the protagonist) and use a system called "E-mote" that allows the in-game characters to be animated, instead of stationary sprites. Nekopara Vol. 0 added a new feature where the player can click on characters in-game, to "pet" them. The characters will react in different ways depending on where the player pets them.\n\nThis is what Wikipedia told me...","March 15","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, my playtime is up at something around 7-8 hours, as I ended up having to leave it open to get card drops, which I found quite annoying.\n\nAside from that, the game itself is much of the same if you've played Nekopara 1; there appears to be no ~naughty~ patch, though there is some fanservice, albeit not explicit, but the game is just a day in the life of the catgirls. It's very much the kind of thing that interested me about Nekopara to start with, cute catgirls with excessively bouncy boobs.\n\nWorth it if that's what you're into.","May 3","true","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Indeed, however, this game IS still a Prologue, so one is able to do nothing but take a slight glance at what lies ahead, and from what one can see, the Writing seems pretty high-quality, each scenario is orchestrated pretty good, comedic moments are a plenty there isn't a out-of-place situation thoughout.\n\nGraphicsTwo words. Chest bounciness.\nWell I'm screwed since i can't afford to make it so lacking, gratefully, this game's art direction is probably its strongest point besides the Cast and the 50un67r4ck.\nFirst of all, in a era of brown-grayish down-to-earth ultra-realistic games for the edgy casual masses, this game barges into the building with a extremely colourful plus anime-like aesthetic and stands proudly as a nice change of pace.\nAmazingly detailed, not to mention all your Cast is dynamic and fully animated (2D), even for a mere Prologue, this game goes all out with the graphic capability, Chest Bounciness withstanding~\n\nSoundtrackGoddam, this Soundtrack, man.\nIt doesn't have the "Gr8 Soundtrax" tag, and I will never understand why (Maybe because 2 weeaboo, needs more casual), quite frankly, this game's tunes have stuck to my head so often that im quite happy they remain for the Sequels, even for a Prologue, the music covers so many situations that its quite well-rounded, without losing quality.\n\nDurationI've been using the word Prologue a lot during the last Categories, have I?\nIs because I'm a terrible writter and to excentuate the fact that this is a PROLOGUE. aka, Short little look to the true Volumes, because of this, the game itself is pretty short, shouldn't take more than one hour (If you don't spend 20 minutes laughing like a absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥ that is), but I find it perfect for a "Demo" game, 30 minutes should be enough for one to dictate if they in or they out.\n\ntl;drFor Prologue standards, it does mostly everything it should do, and pretty dam well at that, only particularly lacking area would be the Story, but the game promises so much on the other areas that it quickly becomes a ant-sized hitch.\nI personally think is worth checking this one out, it is unlikely you like Nekos, but is even more unlikely for you to like Nekos and don't want to check/disliked what this game offers, because honestly, you will be missing a pretty spectacular Opening.\n\nIn consequence, i shall rate this game...\nBath Scene/10","May 25","true","2.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

My favorite part is be able to pet the catgirls in this version, which sadly appears you can't do in the next game. Doesn't really matter though, because the games are still cute anyway.\n\nThere isn't much to tell about the game other than its a visual novel about catgirls.

My class rated this game quite hugely in love if you know what i mean, we were screaming and in the middle of the act the teacher came in and stopped us, he could hear the soft moans from the game and he said "Mause please turn off the game".

It is mostly a short story with a little "hands on" gameplay featuring cats and their owner as Japanese Anime Girls all cuddly and cute. It is a nice change if you just want something a little different to do and don't want to interact much. So sit back and enjoy the nice story. It's inexpensive and you do get all the "perks" with Achievements and Trading cards for those who collect 'em. This is a three part story . . .so far.

This story takes place when Main guy still lived at home and therefore coexisted with his harem of cat girls. Main Male doesn’t even really exist Vol 0 . He appears at one point and is often the topic of discussion, but never exerts himself as a protagonist. Well, the cats and younger sister. She might as well be part of the harem though as her brother complex is played up once again for amusement and for some creepy as hell.\n\nIf all you’re looking to do for 45 minutes is watch cutesy cat girls to goof off, then you’re in for a great time. However, if you’re looking to learn much of anything more about the cast or Main past you’ll be sorely disappointed. Then again, it’s worth recalling that the original visual novel was fairly simple too. It’s just unfortunate to see how vapid this release turned out. As with before, this is still a visual novel that offers the player no choices at any point. There is one ending and everyone receives it if they read through to completion. You’ll find achievements to collect, though they are related mostly to petting each character. The “pet” mechanic is kinder cute and doesn’t actually impact the progression.\n\nI would recommeded play vol 1 if you enjoyed so much or just want learn more about Cat girls, mystery main guy back story ect....","March 29","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slashley/recommended/385800/","Slashley","Slashley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slashley/","126 products in account","tl;dr; version: This is an extremely short (30-120 minutes) Nekopara game. Little is different from before.\n\nLong version: Nothing has really been removed or changed from my Vol1 review, so keep those points in mind:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Slashley/recommended/333600\nI'm not going to copypaste it here as this is a very small game.\n\nBut some things have been added:\n+ Petting system. Whenever the E-Mote system is active, you can pet the girls who are on the screen with a button on the topright. The girls react to three places, head, stomach... and breasts. Because why not, I suppose.\n- The petting system is slightly lazy at this point. All the girls react about the same way. The only noticeable difference is petting Cinnamon's breasts... while everyone else fidgets nervously (or I guess you could call that bouncing nervously?), Cinnamon instead pushes her prided chest towards you. Ah, true PLOT.\n+ The petting system works in various stances. For example, it works in Azuki's normal stance and in her famous "ever vigilant boobie grabber" stance. Also in Cinnamon's normal and daydreaming stance. Oh, and I noticed that you can't pet Shigure's chest while she's in her sideways stance, holding her hand up. Since she's covering her chest with her hand. Is that good or bad...?\n- The petting system, sadly, does NOT return the girls back into their previous expression. They're always left with a smile from the petting. This... is a bit odd if someone is in a bad mood, you pet her and then advance the text and BAM. Her next line instantly teleports her smile into a frown again.\n... if they were to actually use that as a route choosing mechanic in Vol. 2, then that'd be amazing, though. Like getting on Cinnamon route would require you to pet her when she is upset (calm her títs... if you know what I'm saying, har har har!) instead of the dull VN standard "talk to Cinnamon / don't talk to Cinnamon" dialog box. Welp, so far Nekopara games haven't had choices of any sort in them so... probably won't happen.\n+ Advanced Settings now has a new option: Frame Rate Setting: Maximum / 60 FPS (default) / 30 FPS / 15 FPS. Changing this setting requires a restart of the game to take effect.\nMaximum gives me 250-350 FPS on my computer, the game uses about 40% of my CPU in this mode.\n60 FPS takes about 10% of my CPU, just like Vol. 1 did. It should be noted that the FPS seems to be jumping between 78-88, just like Vol. 1 did. Either the FPS locking is really slack or Steam's FPS counter lies.\nAt 15 FPS, the game runs at a stable 37 FPS. Again, either Steam's FPS counter lies or the FPS lock is sloppy. Unsurprisingly, the game looks and feels absolutely dreadful on this setting. If somebody wants to play this game on a brick, it may be a helpful setting however.\n- Thanks to the "Maximum" setting, it is now easy to test the multi-threading support... and it doesn't work. Even when it's churning 300+ FPS and set to use 4 cores, it'll only use two cores. Even if I set it to use a single core (default), it uses two cores. Even if I set it to auto, the game uses two cores.\n\nSo yeah. More Nekopara. It's a really small game, but also 3/10th of the price of Nekopara. If you didn't like Nekopara, then you won't this time either. If you did like it however... then I can heartily recommend Vol. 0 as well.","August 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then this game is for you.\n\nEdit because i want too do a good review\n\nOk this VN is based of a series of Sayori's doujin circle group but this is a "Fan Disc" of the series and ive been asked by a few freinds what "Fan Disc" is so im here too tell you.\nA Fan Disc is a like what OVA's are too anime series. There a little somthing extra too the series that wasnt part of the initial VN release. Sometimes a Fan Disc is done just for a "route" of one or more of the girls/guys of the series that wasnt part of the initial VN series.This Fan Disc shows all of the Nekopara cast more and shows a new part od the "E-Mote" system that now includes petting the Nekopara cast. This meaning you can look forward too those things getting part in the sequel.... yes theres gonna be a part 2 of the Nekopara series in the next few weeks.","December 14, 2015","true","261.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My class rated this game quite hugely in love if you know what i mean, we were screaming and in the middle of the act the teacher came in and stopped us, he could hear the soft moans from the game and he said "Mause please turn off the game".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRyDesigns/recommended/385800/","TheRyDesigns","TheRyDesigns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRyDesigns/","750 products in account","Ahhhh. NEKO WORKs return with another installment of their Nekopara (Cat Paradise) series. First and foremost, I’d like to say that this game is a filler game for fans of the first game to satisfy the players until Nekopara Vol. 2 comes out in December 2015! Also, this review might be shorter than my usual reviews because I’m going to touch up on A LOT on my Nekopara Vol. 1 review. Now I’m going to start off with the first thing most people see and look at when there’s a new game out on Steam, it’s the price. This VN is worth much more than it’s currently priced at on Steam. At $2.99, you get a few hours worth of the moe goodness that is Nekopara. With some new added features, this game is definitely a must-buy for Nekopara and Visual Novel fans.\n\nStarting off, there is 1 major new feature implemented in this volume of the Nekopara series and that is the ability to pet them. You can pet them in 3 locations to get different reactions and expressions using their “e-mote” system which I talked about on my previous review. Those reactions and expressions are for me to know and for you to find out. With this volume being a prequel to the original first game, you get some backstory on the location of your character (Kashou) of where he lived as well as how he lived at his old family house. With Nekopara Vol.1 you only got to know 2 of all the catgirls which were Chocola and Vanilla, in this VN though, you get to know the other catgirls from the way they talk to the their personalities. Each catgirl is unique in their own way with their own struggles, insecurities and pleasures in life.\n\nI only got about 1.5 hours of game time from what Steam tells me. I finished the game from beginning to end with a plethora of emotions ranging from happiness to frustration to sadness throughout my entire playthrough. The main storyline of this prequel is that Kashou (you) are gone for the day and you see what the catgirls and your sister do when you’re away. Featuring 15 scenes or “episodes” going from your sister and the 6 catgirls waking you up, prepare breakfast, clean the house, go on a walk, make dinner, take a bath and eventually sleep together. Lastly, I want to add that this game is for all ages and there is no “hidden” content like the previous game except the bath scene which covers the important bits with the magical mist that appears in most ecchi anime.That’s pretty much all there is to this. Again, for $2.99; you are getting your entire money’s worth AND MORE! If you haven’t already bought this, go right now, stop reading and enjoy the cute nekos that you can pet!\n\nTL;DR: Cute nekos return and this time you can pet them! All for $2.99!\nYou can also check this review out on my blog and review site Here[www.tacotaku.com]","August 21, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Upon purchase, he gifted it to me. I was confused and surprised at the sight in my inbox. It certainly didn't seem like my brand of litter (did you catch that pun?), however, I thought to myself, "It's the thought that counts."\n\nImmediately this game triggered me so super hard! I screeched and pounded my fists against my body and attempted to shove blunt objects directly into my ♥♥♥♥. But I kept playing, I couldn't let my dear friend down. I wouldn't disappoint him. After several minutes, it dawned on me, I wanted to harm a living thing. Quickly I jerked my head to where my cat was sleeping. I tried to restrain myself, but as the game kept playing, my impulses got stronger. By the time the characters in the game were making dinner, I was vigorously chasing my cat, Hootie, around the room. "HOOOT!! COME HERE YOU DEMENTED BUBBLEGUM BUTT!!" I howled, and boy, were my arms flailing like an inflatable tube-man.\n\nEventually he tired out, and while my eyes and ears and urethra were all spewing blood and mucus (believe me, blood was everywhere) I fought through the discomfort and force fed him an entire 24 pack of root beer and then shook him until he inflated, and then exploded. By this time the game was practically over. I promptly closed the game and then told my friend about my experience. I was like a bull seeing red, but he offered an explaination for his gift.\n\n"It was a prank, dude." He said. That changed everything! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! GOT ME.\n\nGame made me kill my cat.","January 24","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You get to spend a day with all the girls from morning til bedtime. The game does a good job showcasing the characters and kind of humour and fanservice you can expect from the main games.\n\nIt's a short and cute story, like an anime episode, a filler one but fun nonetheless.\n\nFew notes to sum up:\n- The art and voice acting is amazing, best JPVN on Steam\n- Don't expect any 18+ material, mild fanservice is present\n- No dating sim mechanics are present, it's really just a character showcase/ad for the base games.\n- Moe over nine thousand","January 30","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm satisfied and it was an amusing experience. I felt like I was fully into that universe and that I was WITH the characters experiencing their day with them.

You're just a disembodied third party this time around. Not that one can ever compain about being given the option to pet catgirls.\n\nIf you played the first Nekopara, this is an equally cute abeit short prequel. It's about 1.5 hours long, or less if you don't like to pet catgirls (you monster). Let's be honest, if you played the first game and liked it you're really only reading this if you're concered about the length so my work here is done.

But the only problem i have is that it is short and doesnt give us enough character development like in Nekopara Vol.1.The good thing about this game is that it gives us more depth into the side characters of Nekopara like Shigure and the other cat girls.

I'm satisfied and it was an amusing experience. I felt like I was fully into that universe and that I was WITH the characters experiencing their day with them. If you're looking for a low price, yet high quality visual novel, this is for you!\n\nWith that said, I'm on my way to put Nekopara Volume 1 on my wishlist!","January 29","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was very, very mistaken.\n\nUpon opening the game I was immediately transported into Heaven with the godly soundtrack I was given. The harmonics, the rhythm, everything about it left me in awe. The graphics featured on the main menu were astounding works of art, and the greatest in the animé and mango genre without a doubt.\n\nThe game itself indulged me in its story with it's beautiful narrative and extremely well-thought out storyline. I really felt involed as a character in this game, which is very hard to achieve. Further in the game I was also shown the beauty of the blessed human body, which made thank this game for giving me insight into what life is all about.\n\nUpon finishing the game I reflected upon life and what it means to live it. This piece of art has turned me to Islam, the Religion of Peace in which I am currently learning the ways of the world God created.\n\nThank you Nekopara for making the world a better place, one person at a time.","December 24, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Smile because it happened." ~ Theodor Seuss Geisel.\n\nWhat can I say about Nekopara that hasn't already been said about LoL, WoW or GTA? This game is a masterpiece in every aspect!\n\nStory:\nNekopara tells the thrilling story of Kashou and his struggles in adolescence. After moving away from home to open his own confection shop he is faced with the cruel reality of the world of work and the challenge to find himself. Fortunately he got several cat girls to assist him in this insane quest.\nYou really need to pay attention to experience it all, small details may have you puzzled over the overall plot. I recommend playing through it several times.\n10/10\n\nSound:\nThe music in this game is astounding and rivals the likes of Madonna or Michael Jackson. The background music is crafted with various instruments to create the most pumping beats you will ever hear. A lot of piano and violin is used in perfect sync for melodies which will have you downloading the whole OST just to listen to it over and over again.\nThe voice actors are extremely talented and the emotions they portray are very realistic. From teary solemn to absolute bliss, each voice actor displays a wide array of voice dynamics, and they're a pleasure to listen to.\n10/10\n\nControls:\nThe controls for this game feel very natural, even beginners should have no problem grasping them. The variety of input options is amazing, there are even some buttons with hidden functions. Pressing "P" for example creates some intense moments you won't forget for the rest of your life!\n10/10\n\nGraphics:\nNekopara offers some of the best graphics of all video games. The characters are so eye-dazzling that you might think they are real! The chest bouncyness slider in the options helps to create super realistic physics which will be a benchmark for all future games.\n10/10\n\nOverall\nWe can be proud mankind was able to create this outstanding masterpiece. What a time to be alive.\n10/10","February 17","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You "p"lay as a startu"p" cafe owner joined by two catgirls. The story is a slice of life revolving around these three main characters with a few cameos from your sister and the rest of the catgirl bunch. The character develo"p"ment and voice acting are well done.\n\nNEKOPARA Vol. 0 is a fandisc, essentially an extra for those who wanted a little bit more NEKOPARA. Vol. 0 is a "p"rologue to Vol. 1, showing you an ordinary day in the Minaduki household. Vol. 0 is very short (~30 min to an hour).\n\nFrom a VN stand"p"oint, NEKOPARA utilizes great animations and a full voice cast (besides yourself). The layout is clean and a few game features, such as: re"p"eat voice dialogue, CG/scene/movie viewer, text s"p"eed, menu o"p"acity etc., sets this VN above other generic "p"ieces. Vol. 0 adds a new "Pet" feature, a mode that can be activated any time by clicking the button at the to"p" right. Overall a fun game but one that should only be bought after enjoying Vol. 1.\n\nHint: the frequency of "p"'s in this review is the approximate amount of times you should press "p" while playing.\n\n==== Score ====Good\n- 7/10","November 11, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This story is about Shigure and the Minadzuki Catgirls. While the original mainly was just about Chocola and Vanilla, all six of them have equal screen time this go around. This one is a comedic slice of life story that revolves around a single day in the Minadzuki household and the various antics that Shigure and the catgirls get up to. It's an all ages story with no eros, with the sole exception of a lightly censored bathtime service scene. It was fun to revisit the familiar characters and their personalities while getting to know the other four catgirls more since they had more minor roles last time. It's a fairly short story, 1-2 hours tops, but for a mere 2.99$ I'd say it's a reasonable price. If you're looking to have an hour or so of fun with some cute catgirls doing cat stuff and watching Shigure's hardcore brocon...*cough* I mean wholesome little sister love, you won't regret picking this up.","August 17, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story takes place across a single day, and every situation, no matter how simple it appears at first, spirals out of control. Every character in the household is a ticking bomb, who desperately needs the help of everyone else to not self destruct. A few times they’re brought to the brink of dissolution, only to be pulled back in the last second by one of them.\n\nIn Vol. 1 we saw the brother try to escape the household, only to have everyone follow him to his bakery. In Vol 0 we learn why. The second he left, their reality must have degenerated into unlivable conditions. They might have tried to respect his decision to live alone, but that simply didn’t work. Self preservation instincts kicked in, and they followed him. This is an essential addition for understanding the gritty reality of living with cat girls. It includes a petting mode for total immersion.","August 18, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was perusing the steam store for a cheap game, becasue...well you know why. We are all in this boat together, hate life, buy game to distract, have constant reminders ingame about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ we are and how we should just stop playing and either A.) Focus more in dead end job and get our ♥♥♥♥ together and move on to better deals, B.) Get a job and move out or maybe even secret answer C.) Move out AGAIN. (Nekopara is not a game that provides choices like this, mind you.) It's an addiction, numbing ourselves like this, however, nekopara will show you what a real addiction is like. You will quickly find yourself lockedin in a rook, blinds down, earbuds in, stepping back every few texts of dialogue asking yourseld "Why am I doing this to myself?"\n\nI digress. Apologies for the ramble.\n\nI was very low on cash however all my basic needs and bills were covered. I had such a low ammount of cash it was like I didnt even have anything so it didn't make a diffrence if I spent it. $5.99, $9.99, $12.99! The range goes on, but there it was. $2.99. I quickly look at the title...Neko...Para.\n\nThe shock set in quick out weighed all logic. I check again and notice it wasnt even on sale...it's real price...was $2.99.\nI purchased it quickly and it downloaded quickly as well. I was concerned that it downloaded so quick, but I was still far more concerned as to why it needed my age before I could view it on the steam page.\n\nThere I was. looking at the main menu loosing my mind, loosing my ♥♥♥♥ing mind as to the fact that this actually exists, and that I just gave all my money to have it. I was so shocked and so determined to see it for myself that I forgot to ask myself "Do I really want to experiance this?"\n\nThe datail. The DETAIL! Oh my gods, the detail! They put so much effort into this! They put so much money into this! Then they speak. After playing this, and every single released volume of this game I can no longer hear a japanese woman speak without feeling that horrible tingle in my body and the hollowness of my legs, my fight or flight instinct sparked from severe cringe. I love to cringe, it used to be a fun hobby...but now...\n\nIt's become a study of phycology\n\nIf you are are actually into this genera, get it.\nIf it isnt for you...get it anyway.

Disclaimer: I haven't gone through vol.1 yet, so I was fresh into NEKOPARA with vol.0.\n\nIn NEKOPARA vol.0, you join the catgirls of the Minaduki household for a day in their life. You'll join them while they cook, eat, order out, go out, bathe, and sleep. They're not sure what's going on with their Master lately either, but they proceed with their daily lives as normal.\n\nThe game contains no "adult" scenes, though there is a section where you join them for a bath (as an observerer, they don't actually interact with you during the entire VN). The text is generally clean, although there are some more slightly adult lines said on occasion. You can also pet the girls (including the non-catgirl, Shigure), and adjust how certain things behave with a slider in the menu.\n\nIt's well priced for the length, which is around an hour. There are no introductions to the character though, so you're likely better not starting with this title if you're starting the series.","August 19, 2015","true","3.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhantomEcho/recommended/385800/","PhantomEcho","Wolfthorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhantomEcho/","48 products in account","Well, I am not proud of having NekoPara in my steam library, and I am not proud of the fact that the game is permanently recorded onto my profile. It's the equivalent of getting a tattoo of a cowboy riding a flaming bowl of potato salad in space on your forehead. You initially think it's an awesome idea, but then you wake up naked, face-first in a ditch on the side of a road in the scorching hot Mojave desert, and you realize that you were sh♣♣ wasted, and you also realize that a Mexican midget named Pablo took one of your kidneys with a rusty hacksaw. At least this would have applied to me if I had actually bought it myself (then again, being gifted the game by a guy named Sanic R is equally as shameful, especially when this guy has a strange thing for potato salad). Anyways, on to the actual review (don't ask what that was about). Where do I begin?\n\nAh yes, The "Story" Let me start this off by saying that visual novels are meant to be interactive experiences that tell a story that can deeply engage it's audience into a world entirely different from theirs and spark a sense of various emotions, whether it'd be fear, joy, despair, excitement and many other emotions that words would not be able to do justice. NekoPara doesn't do any of this. At all. The closest it can get to interaction is giving you the ability to break the fourth-wall by awkwardly stopping time in the novel to pet the catgirls. As far as the story goes, this visual novel revolves around the lives of our catgirl family and their daily routines as individuals (why are they catgirls again, and why do we have a family of catgirls to begin with?). The most you can expect them to do is eat, sleep, do chores, etc. That's it. Really. This is all you're getting out of this visual novel for $2.99, and of course unnecessary bath scenes and chest bounciness physics are included for you perverts out there, and it's obvious that the "nudity" tag brought you here. To sum this section up, this isn't a story-driven experience, but more of a stalking on catgirls' everyday lives simulator (and technically a petting simulator as well).\n\nThe VisualsI'm not gonna lie, viewing this through an art critic's perspective, these are some of the best visuals I have seen in a long time in the anime visual novel category, especially considering the fact that it's an indie visual novel. There certainly is massive attention to detail in the characters and the backgrounds. In fact, this is practically on par with many non-indie anime visual novels, not to mention that the visual novel uses E-mote, which allows the characters to actually move around and make proper facial expressions and lip sync, and the usage of E-mote is rather unheard of in the indie section of anime visual novels since most indie novels awkwardly move the characters like paper dolls, pretending to make several gestures (again, why are they catgirls?).\n\nThe VoicesIt has voice acting. Another thing that is unheard of in the indie section of anime visual novels. How is the quality of the acting you may ask? Again, I won't lie, the voice acting is rather good. It's extremely authentic for what it is. In fact, I would say that it's a bit too authentic... I can't tell if the voice actresses were passionately reading the script, or indulging themselves in rather... naughty affairs and just happen to be recorded in the process. I'm surprised that anyone would be able to voice such characters, given the ridiculous and rather... perverted nature of this novel. It kinda scares me in fact (seriously, why are they catgirls?).\n\nThe CharactersAs you expect, they're your average happy-go-luck anime catgirls, and they partake in rather childish, but cute, antics. It's a cliche in fact, not that it's necessarily a bad thing thing. However, the innocence of these characters vanishes as soon as they involve themselves in mature actions. I may be mostly referring to the events that occurred in the chapter 1 novel, but such actions can't be disregarded so easily since they are the same characters after all. In fact, the NekoPara characters are now on par with hentai characters. Both groups have no shame. Of course I'm pointing this out since a handful of you would rather not own something that isn't work-safe, so I'd be saving you from an awkward explanation to your employer and quite possibly your mother (but then again, this statement also may serve to encourage a handful of you to throw your money at the screen).  (FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHY ARE THEY EVEN CATGIRLS?! WHAT, ARE THEY SIMPLY A SPECIES THAT HAS CO-EXISTED WITH HUMANS SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME? WERE THEY CREATED THROUGH SCIENCE BY CROSSING CATS WITH GIRLS? ARE THEY THE RESULT OF HORRIFIC MUTATION FROM NUCLEAR RADIATION? DID SOME GUY JUST SEE A CAT, AND PROCEED T- you know what, I'm not gonna finish that sentence. Gotta keep this review E rated (for the most part). IT MAKES NO SENSE! IN FACT, WHY DO YOU EVEN LIVE WITH AN ENTIRE FAMILY OF CATGIRLS?! WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?!).\n\nFinal VerdictOverall, I wouldn't recommend this visual novel for the fact that it's extremely short, it is lacking of any form of story, and it is capable of destroying your social life and leaving you unemployed (I'll let you decide whether or not that particular statement should be taken seriously). The only real appeal of this game is to use it as a joke gift to potentially torture and/or traumatize your friends (if they're nuns that is), or to get easy steam trading cards by simply clicking your way through effortlessly.","December 26, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","3","5","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/385800/","BluePaw","BluePaw 🐾","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/","164 products in account","Sigh... this was gifted to me by one of two possible friends just to torment me. It's hard to decline a gift from a friend who has financial troubles and not let her feel like she wasted her money for nothing... despite I gave warnings ahead of time I would decline it... the guilt was too much to possibly bare.\n\n1st ReadThis was hell... utter hell. Usually don't find VN's that all interesting, mainly Anime ones (looking at you Sakura series), as I'm not much of a reader but a doer, if that makes any sense to you. That being said: To me usually VN's =/= Game as there's little to no interactive to be done by the reader, even if it's choice, but to read a story. To The Moon is a fine line between the two and I enjoyed it very much.\n\nHere's what I gathered from this game... btw I read this before Vol 1, which was also gifted by same friend.\n\nCharacters: Unique in their own way, yet they all have their moments of putting the dunce cap on, like the air freshener scene. Shigure however creeps me the hell out... someone is overly obsessive for their sibling.\nWriting: I noticed a few Spelling mistakes along with grammar in terms of missing words... but seemed alright.\nMusic: Most of it just didn't seem fitting or out of place... one track sounds like a gameshow for pete sake!\n[s]Voice: HAD IT TURNED OFF THE WHOLE TIME, LOOK FOR ANOTHER REVIEW ABOUT THIS![/s]\nStory: Will admit it was funny in it's weird "uguu" way... but a lot of it was cliche anime tropes...\nAnimation: Half the time it looks like their doing a shuffle. The 2D art looking 3D made me have very little motion sickness, which adds up more as I read to the point I had to stop and call it a day before continuing...\n\nGuess I can't deny it's alright... overall didn't enjoy it, but again I'm not a VN person and I'm picky when it comes to Anime media. If you're an Anime fanatic like most people on steam I keep running into, you may like this... otherwise wait for a sale and enjoy torture.\n\nNow to suffer Vol. 1... send fish, gonna need it.\n\n2nd ReadDecided to give this a second read aftering finishing Vol 1 as I felt I was misjudging it and being harsh...\n\nI turned the voices on this time and it really helped to give you the context of the tone when reading it along with any sounds that plays, and bring out more laughs. It was funny most of the time, with a few awkward bits with how the characters moved to give you context of what they were doing (VN's and their limited animation). Nothing much else to say other than I enjoyed it more than my first read.\n\nRead this after Vol 1 though, despite this is more of a prequel.\n\nUpdate: Wrote a review for Vol 1: http://steamcommunity.com/id/BluePaw/recommended/333600","December 30, 2015","true","5.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"
