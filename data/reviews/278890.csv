"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MateusDrake/recommended/278890/","MateusDrake","Mateus Drake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MateusDrake/","469 products in account","What is this?An unforgiving, 2D side-scroller platformer.        The Best:The feeling of accomplishment after successfully completing the game, or at least netting a few nice items by dumb luck or careful potion use before your almost always imminent death.                Love Nintendo Hard platformers?This game is for you...        The Worst:Being born the son of a Peasant when your choice of father was "Great Guy". The swirling arrow icon that resets your progress on said random fatherhood mode without any warning. And, of course, dying. Specially right next to the final boss.\nScores                Personal:        75/100        I had a great time playing this game. Quite challenging, yes, but I found in it a great way to kill time, specially when internet was MIA.                Overall:        60/100        It's a short game, relies mostly on replay value that comes with randomized items and classes. Its main objective is to unlock five stars on "Great Guy" mode. Really recommended to great fans of unforgiving 2D side-scrollers that enjoy being kept on their toes (any second can be your last and throw all your progress on that run away). This game has no narrative, it's pure gameplay. Quite straightforward, brutal yet fun and addicting gameplay.\nVisuals, Sound Design & GameplayVisuals:Everything is just so cute... On this land where everything and everyone is out to get you. And they will. Time and time again.\nCharming, albeit a little bit bland, colorful 2D graphics. Its visual cues are functional, every object and enemy is able to convey what it's able to do, and how you should react.\nThe levels are quite well crafted, too, specially regarding secrets and different paths. They're not all that obvious, making you feel somewhat clever for finding new things on your first few runs.\n(C'mon, even the bloodthirsty butcher looks cute)\n\nVisuals: 8/10\nThe art style is cute, a contradiction in regard to the game brutal difficulty. Yet, it works, and gives that feel that Villager "I will murder you and devour your soul" face gives over at Smash Bros.\n\nSound Design:It works. The music complements the game well, although I judged it a bit forgettable at first, it grew on me, and I've come to think it matches the tone of the game seamlessly.\nThe sound effects also work fine, adding to the readability of the graphics.\n\nSound Design: 6/10\nIt's good. It's also quite bland and nothing out of the extraordinary, mind you, but it adds to the charm of the game.\n\nGameplay:Its main source of inspiration seems to be Ghouls'n Goblins.\nThe core mechanics of old school platformers is present. You also have a button for each of the characters arms, letting you use one weapon on each hand (I recommend keeping a melee and a ranged one equipped, if available). You can equip three pieces of armor. You can store a few items on your inventory. You can also pickup eggs, which you lose when you're hit and can use to spawn birds that protect you and kill enemies.\n\nEvery piece of equipment has a limited number of uses, so you will be managing your resources, trying not to waste anything or else you will be pretty much defenseless. Items can be found on certain (fixed) locations, and can also drop randomly from enemies.\n\nPotions can be used to restore durability and give special traits to items. Weapons will have their kill potential increased, with bonus such as extended reach or piercing trough enemies. Armor will activate additional effects when you're hit, like spawning fireballs. Helmets will also change the birds you can summon by using eggs into another species, for varying effects.\n\nThe weapons are: Swords, lances (that really drives the point home on Ghouls'n Goblins as inspiration), magic staves and boomerangs, each with its variations and uses. Pretty much all of them are fun to use.\n\nThe items you're able to acquire at the very start of the run depends on "who your father was", you can select it from a few choices or go with "Great Guy" for his profession, which will randomize it. Each time you beat the game with "great guy" for a father, you will collect a white star besides this option, making the game even harder for each star present. If there's a goal on this game besides just having a successful run, it's unlocking "5 stars Great Guy" mode, and then beating it. There are 3 all around classes (Paladin, King and Lancer), 2 pretty different, which translates in unique runs, albeit requiring more strategy and awareness (Shepherd and Alchemist), and Peasant, which transforms the game in one hit kill mode, removing armor spawns and adding difficulty to whoever is masochist enough to try and beat this game with the extra challenge. The classes "Great guy" gives you depending on your difficulty, with the last 3 ones only appearing after clearing this mode a few times.\n\nThe levels are linear and the items spawned are fixed. The enemies are randomized, although lightly. Each level, you will see the same enemies every run, although varying in number and spawning locations.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nIt's straightforward, yet complex enough to be interesting. It gets repetitive, and you might get tired of it before you unlock those 5 stars, but controlling your character is fun.\nIts challenging nature gives you that cozy feeling when you succeed.\n\nController highly recommended, but not required.\n\nAchievements:As a somewhat recent addition, this game received achievements.\nI didn't actually play after that update, but by looking at the descriptions, I can see pretty much all of them are doable, except for the one that requires you to beat the game with a Peasant as your father...\nJust by playing the game you will unlock most of the, but seems quite hard to 100% it.\n\nPricing:It's quite cheap, and gets discounts every once in a while. Also, as of today, it's been featured on five different bundles, which is great.\n\nIt's worth full price if you're a fan of the genre and believes you're going to get a few hours of fun out of this title every once in a while.\nIf you have any interest in the genre, you should at least get it while it's on sale.\n\nOpinion Piece:I like this game. I have the feeling I liked it more than I should, it has its flaws, its limitations and, well, its bugs (Items can be duplicated or simply disappear, for instance). But I like it. It has its charm, its moments and is a great game to play when you've got time to kill for whatever reason. You can just pickup and play a few runs, no strings attached, no need to keep sessions long.\n\nMainly playing this in offline mode, I think Steam doesn't have a perfect grasp on how many hours I actually played.\n\nRecommendation (TL;DR):If you like old school 2D Side-scrollers, specially for the challenge the NES-era packed, well, you're in for a few hours of running, jumping, dying, crying tears of despair, fury and joy. This game deserves the title of Nintendo Hard, and if you like that, it deserves a place in your library.\nIt's a neat little game to play while your internet isn't working, or you're on a matchmaking queue on another game, etc.\n\nWhen you get the hang of it, getting to know patterns, spawn points and strategies, the fun comes from successfully beating the game with different items and overcoming difficult odds. That gets old after a while, but you can put the game down and pick it up to play again whenever you're bored. It's also funny to see other people struggling with it.","January 24, 2015","true","10.4"," 102 of 124 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","102","124","4","5"

Ghosts & Goblins?  Wizards and Warriors?  Cave Story?  I wanna be the guy?  Angvik is an indie platformer that provides some of the gaming goodness that all of the above games contained, but brings with it a couple of nice twists to it's gameplay mechanics.  I had the pleasure of playing this game quite a bit before it made it's way to Steam and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Angvik is more than the sum of it's parts.  The best way to describe the gameplay would be to say that it's a mashup of many other platformers.  Angvik does however implement it's mechanics in a unique way that feels slightly different from any other game, while boasting it's own unique 8 or 16 bit style.  It's not exactly a "metroidvania" styled game, but it does have loot drops and a plethora of items for players to discover and play around with, which isn't bad considering it's not an RPG but rather a full on sidescrolling platformer.  The most important part of any platformer is how well it controls and responds.  Thankfully, Angvik has fairly user friendly controls that are responsive.\n\nPlayers will choose from a number of different character classes right at the beginning of the game.  These character classes change the gameplay immensely and particularly in the early game.  You have your choice of a King, a Lancer, a Shepherd, a Paladin, an Alchemist, a Peasant, or a "Great Guy".  Depending on who you choose, you'll start off with different weapons, armors, and items, some of which are very silly, but also very fun to play with.  You have a bird companion who also helps you during your travels by collecting and hatching eggs that will spawn other birds who will shield you and attack enemies for you.\n\nThe graphics and sound don't immediately look like much but the characters and enemies are quite amusing to look at up close.  There's certainly a retro vibe to it all, but if you appreciate older NES, SNES, Genesis, and early PC platformers, then you'll have no problem with Angvik's dated graphic style.  The music isn't extremely memorable, but it does provide a filler for the gameplay.  Thankfully the music isn't annoying either.\n\nThe options menu is a little lackluster, but at least it provides a way to play the game in either windowed or full screen mode.     Other options are minimal but you can rebind the controls to your liking and (thankfully) Angvik comes with Gamepad and Controller support which I feel improves the gameplay for those who are not as comfortable playing a platformer with their keyboard alone.  On the other hand, the keyboard controls work just fine, so there are no complaints either way.\n\n--  The Good  --\n\n- Classic Platforming gameplay (see above)\n- Gameplay that will remind you of other great classics (but not a clone)\n- Responsive controls using either Keyboard or Gamepad\n- Multiple classes with unique gameplay styles\n- Lots of replay value due to classes and loot drops\n- Excellent price!  You're actually getting a lot of bang for your buck!\n\n--  The Bad  (or so-so)  --\n\n- Dated graphics\n- Gameplay that will remind you of other great classics (some people don't actually like that sort of thing)\n- Minimal options and settings can be off-putting to some gamers.\n\nI definitely recommend Angvik for anyone who enjoys their platformers.  You really can't beat the amount of gameplay you're getting at this price of admission.","February 24, 2014","true","3.7"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","39","51","0","1"

After multiple fails and over 2 hours of gameplay I felt seriously frustrated, but still I was NOT able to stop playing it. There's 6 starting classes (It's called "your father was" - King, Lancer, Sheperd, Paladin, Bottler and Peasant) but after a short time you'll lose starting items, so at al there's no diffirence which one you'll pick at the beggining. You can summon birds and they will help you fight with enemies on your way. You can also collect and use oils to improve your attack abilities or just to repair your armor/weapons. Every item you have can be destroyed by using it (weapon) or when you take hits (armor). Each map has time limit and your character gets older very fast, so you can't just stand and waste seconds. You can't block incoming attacks, so the only one way to avoid is jumping like there's no tomorrow "mario-like-jumps". At all timing is a key and everytime you start game again your run will be better than before.\nFrom graphic side game is fine - you'll not find a fireworks in here but everything is aesthetically made and will not hurt your eyes. Sounds are fine too - after 2 hours I still do not turned music off.\nA game not for a long time and not for everyone, but with fair price adjusted to what it offers.","May 30, 2014","true","2.5"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","30","36","0","0"

That's normal. There's a 'great guy' option when choosing your character that starts at one star difficulty and randomizes your character (and the map to some extent in later difficulties). When you beat it two star unlocks, and so on. Birds can be hatched from eggs dropped by all sorts of enemies (Like monkeys!) and the type of bird depends on what hat you're wearing, and weapons and armor can be changed with 'oils.' The classes were simple, a few being more interesting than others. The king is the most OP with full armor and a sword, the bottler has oils and no weapons, and the peasant doesn't get any armor drops throughout the whole game. There are a few more, too.\n\nI didn't really experience any bugs, but sometimes as shepard my sheep would somehow appear in the ground instead of the air and couldn't move.... which was interesting.\n\nOverall, good platformer with relentless enemies and solid gameplay.

It starts by getting the basics of platforming right, and follows with an inventory system that takes some thought and practice to master. The atmosphere created by the music and graphics is very relaxing, even though the game can be challenging at times. I really appriciated the creatively drawn enemies and items. My only issue is that each time you die you have to play through from the first level again, which can be repetitive since there is little variation from game to game and it becomes a basic excercise pretty quickly. There's not much replay value for the same reason, that only some enemy spawns and items are randomized. But overall, I would recommend this game for the price. It creates a great atmosphere and has solid platforming with an interesting twist, just don't expect a long experience or great replayability.","March 7, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've just completed the game completely, from start to finish. It took me about 3 or 4 hours to do all together. That's including my rage quitting and deaths and all that. Failed runs, etc.\n\nThe game is a great deal of fun, and highly addiction. There are a few bugs or maybe minor glitches. One of which has to do with getting caught on certain "ramp" surfaces as you walk. Simple, just jump . It's not really consistant with any interaction from what I've seen, and it's fairly rare.\n\nThe boss fight at the end is somewhat challenging. Just know that if you don't have armor in the slightest or at least a decent weapon then you're almost certainly going to lose unless you're particularly good at this sort of thing. I won't spoil it for you, but just know the game ends with a boss fight.\n\nThat being said, the game ended rather lacklusterly for me. I was hoping there would be more, perhaps an unlockable or somewhat, but it doesn't seem to be so. It's simple "you won!" and then the credits. The only other thing it seems is that there are higher "difficulties" as shown by how many stars are under the "Great Guy" sort of "Class" thing. I have two stars now, and giving a quick run through the first level, it seems that the amount of enemies that are in a given level are increased, thus making it more difficult. So it still has some replayability to it. That being said, the game itself is a whopping 2 dollars, so what can you expect, right? The game could easily sell for 5 dollars, though. It is fantastic.\n\nThere are plenty of unique weapons, and the "oils" system is wonderful, though some seem to be fairly useless. The bird system I figured out is not useless. There are some enemies that are just total pains in the ♥♥♥, but so long as you don't agro them they won't move, or some of them don't move much at all. That's when you whip out your bird eggs and hope they hit, which they usually will.\n\nAlso, a neat little feature is the subtle aging of your character as you progress through each level as a sort of "timer". At some point, though I didn't count it specifically, it will show you a prompt which says you're getting old and you better hurry up! I thought this was pretty cool.\n\n9/10.\n\n-----------------------------------------Previous Review----------------------------------------------\n\nAngvik is a pretty decent time killer. It's challenging, from what I've played of it. I've gotten to the second level, after about 30 minutes of failing repeatedly! You're going to die a LOT. The combat is fluid and simple, but still hard as hell. There's a variety of different enemies, weapons, and classes. Classes, however, seem to be more or less for your starting items. You can't go wrong with the King class.\n\nComplaints? Well, a few. It just throws you into the game giving you no idea of what exactly to do, aside from a few little things. The bird system I don't want to say is useless, but it's useless if they don't tell you what it's actually for. From what I see it seems to be some kind of temporary orbiting attack bird that kills any enemies it touches. At least, I think that's what it does if it were to actually touch an enemy! However, I'm probably just awful at aiming it/timing it. It could be interesting.\n\nThey don't tell you what exactly the point of the game is, how many levels, or what certain items such as armor and weapons do. You have to find out the hard way, which I almost like. I found out that the king's armor can reflect ranged attacks, which is cool.\n\nFor the low low price of whatever it says up there I would definitely get this game - as I already did on a whim. It's a good game for casual people, and if you like RPG's like this and semi-rogue likes (Not procedurally generated, but still one life idea) you'll have a lot of fun. It's fairly addicting - while still being quite possible to rage quit from dying so often!\n\nI'd give it a 7.5/10. -2.5 for the issues I stated earlier.","February 24, 2014","true","5.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Basically mario but if you wall into a trap or get hit you die and lose all progress and start from scratch. Doesn't that sound like fun (*facepalm*)?! I guess the "replay" value is that you can pick different classes to start, but they only differ in what their armor looks like and their starting weapon. The lancer sucks and throws his weapon away with each hit. Also weapons just break after 2 hits. Oh yeah I forgot how much sense it makes that after slashing 2 people with a sword, the sword would suddenly not work anymore, as if they weren't made to slash things....herp derp. You basically don't use weapons since they break right away and just have to hop on people. There are random things like eggs and oils but they aren't explained at all, and the oil I got seemed to actually be a negative thing, but since you basically never get weapons again it doesn't matter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swegmeisterjimmy/recommended/278890/","swegmeisterjimmy","Sonny Joce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swegmeisterjimmy/","199 products in account","This game is kind of fun, but it has some aspects that do make it slighltly difficult to enjoy. For gamers with less than average skill levels (like me) who die alot, the lack of save points made it hard to advance and finish the game, although it is short. As I died and restarted at the first level (as i did often) it became quite boring as the exact same levels kept coming and coming. It became quite monotonous and this was a large turn off for me, and I believe this game would be better with randomized levels, with themes just like in the current version. I believe that there should have been items for your chosen class scattered throughout the game. Each class come with it's unique items, and these items (I believe) should dictate how you play through the game, but as weapons break and armour is destroyed, you quickly become a stock, weak and vulnerable man and any of the classes can end up this way irreversibly. If your character could find weapons and armour based on the class you picked around levels and become the powerful fighter he was at the start, it would further encourage you to learn the class and take advantage of it's strengths and weaknesses. The game has a very nice feel with it's platforming action and comical visuals and although there are many good things in the game, here is alot the developers could have improved on.","July 14, 2014","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'd say wait till it goes on sale again because $3.00 is a little much for what's there. The melody in the background is great when you're feeling stressed and matches with the theme in the game. I always felt like the bad guy because your character interupts the mostly peaceful world, but their all against you so I don't feel that bad. There is an upgrade system incorperated with oils (black oil is the best). Though it's no Mario, it is a good distraction if you need to keep your hands busy while paying attention to something else. There is little completionist value, but a good little game nonetheless. The game has enough variety to keep you playing until you win and if nothing else, you'll play to see what different weapons/armor you can get. As for the controls, I haven't really have a problem, but a controller might be needed for some players but platformers like super meatboy are far superior, so either spend the money for a mild, lightened platformer or save for the better games.","August 12, 2014","true","28.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can see the love put in this game. The game is quite short, but not very easy.  Don't expect to get tens of hours of excitement from this game. It needs a little different viewpoint. I would consider this game as a piece of video game art, in some sense. Though this is not an "art game" like some other abstract or beautiful scenery games, it is art in the context of video games. This is hard to explain, sorry, but you have to play it to understand what I mean. If you like classic platformers done with style and love, you will like this game also.\n\nAngvik is nice counterbalance to any hectic platformer, here the atmosphere is calm and somehow relaxing, even though the game isn't easy. The weapons and armors are fun and bring a little variety to the game. You can choose from 6 starting classes, each of which has different starting gear. There is also to choose randomly, each time completed this way the game gets a bit harder (I suppose from the achievement implications, I have yet only beaten it once). So there is definitely replay value in here if you will decide to go for every achievement. Due to it's calming atmosphere it is nice to come back to it sometimes and try to beat it with a different "great guy as your father" (or class, if you prefer).\n\n3€ is not much, but grab this definitely when on sale if you like the sorts of thing I described.\n\nI also recommend to try Alastair John Jack's other great platformer, Arvoesine (which is freeware).","May 13, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Other reviewers compare it to Dark Souls because it's so difficult, but it's honestly nothing like Dark Souls at all. It's really just an unforgiving platform game where you have to get through the whole game without dying. Enemies drop items which you can pick up (or your bird friend picks up) and they either A) add 1 HP for you, or b) give you a weapon. If you're fully armed then the bird puts it in it's napsack and rearms you when you lose your items. It's kind of cool, but really frustrating as your first encounters with stuff will probably lead to your death, in which case you go all the way back to start 100% of the time. From what I understand there are no save points in this game at all. I've made it 8-9 screens through the game after 20 minutes. So yeah, kind of neat, it's only $3, but why so freaking hard for no reason other than to be the frustratingly kind of difficult? Instead of the challenging kind of difficult like Dark Souls is.

The "game" in all takes about 10 minutes to beat once you understand how it works, and replay value is very low. The only things that change are what character you play and what enemies get generated in each level. Hitting enemies is frustrating; thrown weapons often skim enemies without killing them, and stomping heads is difficult given varying enemy traits - s♥♥♥♥♥dic movements, rapid ranged attacks that are hard to dodge, slim enemy hitboxes, A lot of times, avoiding enemies entirely is the best option, which is incredibly unfortunate given killing enemies is about the only thing to do.

Firstly I agree it's quite good game, there are many qualities which make it unique and enjoyable. Some examples would be:\n\n- it's a platform game, but with very unique lands, yes they may look like other games (for me they looked a bit like Kirby's Epic Yarn maps..) but they have very different "monsters" and obstacals which I have not seen used before.\n- The characters are very cute\n- The music is okay..\n- The price is good, I would have actually paid a little more for this\n\nSo the game does have it's "pros" but I have not recommended it for these reasons:\n\n- The screen moves with the avatar- which you would expect, but it's a bit fast and jolty, after a while it actually made my eyes/brain hurt xD\n- The controls are really confusing. At the start it does not tell you what any of the controls are (they aren't the normal W,D,S and A) so you have to try and navigate your way to the options menu- and then change them. But I think there are too many options, for example the character can hold two weapons at a time which do different things- you also need two different keys to use them... but which ones do you choose?! You will forever be trying to find which keys you are confortable using and positioning them close enough together so you don't have to use the whole key board!\n- There really needs to be check points. When you die you literally restart the game and choose a new avatar and lose any new potions/weapons/armour you find.\n- Dying is very easy, which I guess makes this game a little challenging- there's nothing wrong with that. It's just when you can lose all your armour- that does not protect you anyway- then die.. and restart.. It's just a bit annoying..\n- Finally some of the characters throw their weapon (usually misses target) and then you have to walk and find it.... there could easily be more monsters ready to kill you that second and you will not have a weapon...\n\nI can just about carry on playing.\nAs I said "there's not much to it" it's just very simple.\n\n5/10 would die every 2 seconds again..\n\nALSO! this game reminds me of "ghouls 'n' ghosts" (1988) Same idea of losing armour?","August 10, 2014","false","1.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

No Armour Mode (Peasant preset) is available for players looking for a challenge.\n- Has continued developer support.\n\nCons:\n- The jerky camera that follows the player is an annoying hindrance; the camera is tolerable in window mode.\n- The game has a barebones tutorial and provides little information on system mechanics (equipment presets, properties of power-ups, oil, eggs, etc).\n- Game is choppy, especially fullscreen and when there's a lot happening on screen. A crisper option was added to better performance but it seems to have the opposite effect.\n- Sometimes enemy projectiles become stuck or throwing weapons disappear off-screen.\n\nNeutral Points:\n- Single health and life gives the game moderate difficulty; deaths will occur but the game becomes easier as you play.\n- The different equipment pre-sets allow players to tailor their character but don't add replay value due to on-site procurement and enchanting.\n- The game's art is clean and expressive but the animation, level-design, enemies, and music is rather bland and uninspired.\n- The game is short (6 stages) with little replay value and an underwhelming boss fight. However, the game's length is justified by it's very low pricepoint.\n- Enemy interaction with the stage is iffy; sometimes enemies don't detect gaps and run across them several times before falling.\n- You shouldn't need to equip keys to open a door.","May 14, 2014","false","3.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

If you die once in the game, you must start from the beginning - No save points what so ever. The main difference between runs is that you can choose your starting gear but that breaks quickly and from there on you are essentially at the mercy of the games drops and your platforming/dodging skills. The levels can become very repetitive and are rather uninspired in terms of both artistic value and level design. This game is certainly challenging like Dark Souls, and some people might find enjoyment in that but for the average person - you may have more frustration than actual fun.\n\nP.S.

The world of Angvik is kind of similar to the world of Super Ghouls and Ghosts; everything that moves (except your helpful bird buddies) will kill you, or at least cause you to shed a protective layer of armour. Oh, and some stationary things will kill you too.\n\nI'm sure this will get infuriating eventually, but honestly everything is just so darn charming and adorable that I don't mind the endless death so much. You kill your adorable enemies and get items, sometimes weapons, sometimes armour, sometimes other stuff, sometimes eggs, and you give the eggs to your bird friend and your bird friend shouts "bird!" Or "egg!" Then the egg hatches into another bird, which will get killed so that you can live for another ten seconds or so. Then the next plant or fish or menacing coral thing touches you and your clothes pop off and you die. And this nice soothing music plays and it's all quite lovely really.","March 9, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Make your way through each level, picking up loot from chests and fallen baddies, with a few secrets here and there. Even has weapon modification by way of potion additives. The weapons deteriorate from use, and your character ages from beginning to the end of each level, eventually dying if you don't complete the level in time (age resets at the start of new levels). Short, but sweet, and the increasing difficulty of the play+ gives a reason to keep coming back. A much better investment than a cup of coffee! Built with the Construct 2 game engine!\n\nI was using an XBox 360 wireless controller during play, and I noticed that there were a few instances where I'd land on a platform and just start unintentionall moving. This caused problems when precision was key, but it didn't happen often at all.

It was nice. You can be so many diffrent things, with armor, weapons and the birds you find. The potions are cool too. But this game is really, REALLY hard. If you die you have to start from the very begining of this long game and then you have to use the weird controls to pick your "father" all over again. It would be nice if it could remember which "father" you selected last and when you died it started off with that one highlighted and ready for you to press the s button on to select it. Being an amateur programmer who will probably never be as good at programming a Alastair john Jack is, it would be pretty simple to implement this. Maybe not now after so much has been done to this game already, but yeah. But I actually really like this game and it is beautiful in audio, visuals and creativiy. I love the style and entire games of Alastair John Jack but this game is really just too difficult. I know it would make the game really easy with checkpoints but right now it is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/literaryvideogames/recommended/278890/","literaryvideogames","Literary Video Games","http://steamcommunity.com/id/literaryvideogames/","23 products in account","Angvik, the 2D action platformer from Alastair John Jack, is a bit like Dark Souls and a bit like Angry Birds. Although this combination sounds ridiculous, allow me to recount my first run: after spending two minutes spewing fluffy sheep from my pink staff, my character came into contact with some kind of monkey-dog and exploded into a (rather dainty) pile of bones.  This strange mashing of hardcore gaming and casual visuals allows Angvik to stake out an identity in a relatively crowded market.\n\nWhile the cute art style deserves attention, Angvik shines brightest through its punishing gameplay.  Don't expect to button-mash your way through combat—instead, prepare for several deaths as you slowly learn enemy patterns.  Admittedly, many games require this type of memorization.  Angvik, however, also requires the player to be very adaptable.  Because nearly all of the game's weapons break after three or four successful attacks, players must constantly shift their offensive and defensive strategies.  Close combat, for instance, isn't necessary with a boomerang—but you'll have to change things up after you switch out the boomerang for a sword that shoots fireballs.  And when you fail, a frequent occurrence, don't expect to load up a save game: you'll be starting from the beginning on each playthrough.\n\nAdding to the difficulty is a subtle timer measured by the player's age.  As you progress throughout each of the five stages, your character grows older (demonstrated by his whitening hair) until he collapses dead.  With only one 'hurry up' warning, this mechanic occasionally caught me off-guard.  That said, it fits well and adds another level of difficulty to the game...even if I don't understand how I can be an old man at the end of the first stage and a teenager at the start of the next.\n\nWhile the first two mechanics boil down to a durability counter and a timer, the last two are more interesting.  Oils, found by killing enemies and opening chests, are used to transform items.  Green oil turns a paladin's cross into a wooden boomerang, and black oil shifts a stick into a powerful great-sword.  These oils inject a small amount of strategy and experimentation into what is otherwise a very straightforward platformer. Lastly, the player picks up eggs that can be converted into weaponized birds.  I think that's pretty self-explanatory.\n\nAs much as I've praised Angvik, I found the game lacking in several areas.  The UI is frustrating—as far as I can tell, you cannot find statistics on equipped armor.  (Yet, for some reason, information is available on unused armor.)  Secondly, the game has a fair amount of bugs.  My computer, according to the developer's website, is perfectly capable of running Angvik; yet the game lags after I play for a few minutes, and it occasionally crashes.  On a more neutral note, the music is decidedly mediocre: it fits, but it doesn't add much to the game.\n\nMy biggest issue with Angvik is the way the developer forced it to become a classic arcade experience.  Despite possessing some roguelike elements in random enemy and weapon generation, this game lacks randomly generated levels.  The result is a contradictory experience: sure, the player needs to adapt on the fly, but at the same time the easiest path to success involves memorizing the layout of the world.  The preset map has other disadvantages as well: secrets lose their secrecy because, once discovered, they remain in the same spot on each subsequent playthrough.  Ultimately, Angvik boils down to one big pattern—and while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it does feel outdated.\n\nI had a lot of fun the first few times I booted up Angvik, and I may play it a few more times after I publish this review.  That said, this game offers little replayability in the face of true roguelikes.  There's a lot to like about Angvik, and I enjoyed it in the short run.  In the long run, however, I'd rather play something else.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 7.2/10\nThis review was written for Literary Video Games.
