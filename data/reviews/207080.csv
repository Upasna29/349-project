What makes this so much more special is that it's all coming from indie developers (indie = independent).\n\nVideo games today are becoming arguably less interesting, unique or fun. A prominent example would be the Call of Duty series. This is often due to corporations or big companies pressuring developers to not take risks, to follow a formula or to indulge in what has been termed "shady game practices". I'm talking about controversial DLC or downloadable content (now associated with small content cut from the main game and sold for a large price afterwards), lack of support after a title's release, paid reviews, and more. Go back roughly 2 decades and there was a time when: developers were always seeking to create unique experiences for all platforms, there was never any hesitation to release free additional expansion packs and the consumer base weren't treated like buffoons and were engaged with directly.\n\nIndie games or indie developers are essentially a revival of that golden age of gaming. It's true, the indie scene have been around even in the early 1990s but due to advancing technology, growing expectations and an increasingly competitive market (consoles, PCs and other gaming platforms) -- small teams have become big teams and these teams have since sought companies that will fund their large projects. Viewed initially by many as a good thing, it's attributed to what the majority now term a "gradual decline in game ingenuity". Indie is the response to that.\n\nSo that's what Indie Game The Movie is all about. It showcases what it means to be indie and some of the big names behind the indie rebirth in the late 2000s. Braid; Super Meat Boy; Fez. Video games which are now extremely recognizable but only because of how different they were to what else was being offered to gamers at the time. "Different" comes at a cost though. Risk. The teams behind these 3 video games contained groups as big as 5 people or as small as just 2. Not only was their life sacrificed but money, wellbeing and in most cases, time, that could have been spent looking for a job elsewhere (that wasn't dominated by well-known series and developers).\n\nYou will personally see the payoff in making something that's your own and that you can share; despite how impossible it may seem at first or the light at the end of the tunnel appearing dimmer than ever. This is especially true with Fez. Fez took 5 long years and a large chunk is spent on Phil Fish. Sympathy, disappointment and joy is what I felt when I saw the development journey or rather, development hell, of Fez. At the same time, Fish is also tackling the ongoing stigma against video games and hoping to prove it wrong. For example: video games are often viewed as a lower form of entertainment and that they can't express ideas and concepts as well as any other medium.\n\nIncredibly, all 3 indie games later go on to be some of the most critically-acclaimed video games of all time. You may never have heard of them before or never realized that something like Minecraft or Amnesia was made with very little manpower but after this experience: you will hopefully begin to respect and appreciate this great twist in the gaming industry. I've always supported indie games and my expectations are time and time again blown away due to the chances taken by the amazing people behind these typically ambitious projects. Being indie was something that was initially laughed at or not taken as seriously as it should've been, and Indie Game The Movie goes to great lengths to make you believe and feel like you're a part of the indie scene.\n\nThat's why Indie Game The Movie is so good. I've never witnessed anything like it before, let alone for something video game-related. It's professionally made, has a great soundtrack and if you buy the Steam version: has tons of extras, additional commentary (from the developers themselves) and a hidden video game! If you do like Indie Game The Movie: buy the DLC "Special Edition DLC". It focuses on more lesser known indies and also follows up the 3 main indie game teams after Indie Game The Movie was finished in production.\n\nIf you're even remotely interested in the gaming industry and want to know what it's like to be indie -- get this now. The $10 price tag is perfect and shouldn't be a barrier for anyone. I'm giving this documentary a score of 8.5/10.","October 1, 2014","true","5.4"," 76 of 93 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","76","93","0","11"

Jonathan Blow seems to be the most normal of the bunch, although it's hard to tell, because the documentary basically forgets about him during the second half.  The film was an interesting watch, to be sure, but I would have liked to see more about how the games were actually developed.

It really gets in deep into these developers and you really get to know them (or at least it feels that way). Its great being able to have a name, a face and a personality to games that we know and love. They’ve been a hit, affected people and I’m glad these guys got some recognition for their hard work and everything they put into it. It’s something I would like to see more of.\n\nThe thing with indie games is that unlike AAA titles, they have personality. They weren’t factory made just to make money. Most of the time it’s an idea that grew into something that became a part of them.\n\nHearing their side to the story, being able to support these people morally and financially (I’m guessing they get a cut from this) is nice. Some people might not think Steam is the platform for this kind of thing but it’s unusual and I like it!\n\nIf you want to look a bit further into indie games and their developers as a whole, this is a definite watch. Not only is this movie a great inspiration to normal everyday people like myself, but I imagine it’s a nice push in the right direction for other people that are looking or wanting to be in game development.\n\nI watched this movie a long time ago, I only just now listened (and/or watched, in ways) the commentary tracks. They have one by the directors and one by Team Meat (who are honestly my favourite part of this movie) and they are both nice to listen to. It’s nice additional content to the movie. The directors are informative and you see things a little more from behind the cameras. Whereas Team Meat are just plain funny as f***.\n\nAchievement wise, this is an easy 100%. Although there is a little hidden mini-game which you get an achievement for which was a tad bit frustrating. Only because I don’t actually know enough indie games off by heart to be able to do it. There was a lot of trial and error for me!\n\nAll in all this is an awesome and inspiring movie and I think it’s definitely worth a watch.\n\n\nTL;DR: Good movie, good commentary and easy an 100%.

This film features Team Meat members: Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes, Phil Fish: creator of Fez and Jonathan Blow: artist behind Braid. All four struggle through the hardships of creating a game. They ponder about why they're going through with this, some of them are losing financually and their social lives are slowly crumbling away as they dedicate all of their time to making these games.\n\nThe movie has many deep, emotional moments where you can almost feel the loss that these artists are going through. One in particular even states that he will follow through with suicide if he cannot finish his game; he has sacrificed too much of his life to continue with that big a failure... We feel you bros ;'o\n\n$10 for an amazing film with really high critical acclaim?? Heck, I'd pay $30 for this masterpiece anyday!

Like, you sit down, expecting something cool video gaming stuff like AVGN or GCCX. But you won't get that. You get ordinary guys talking about their own games, their inspiration, stuff like this. It all feels like a segment from a making of movie. Is it worth watching this? No, absolutely not. Maybe with the commentaries? No chance in hell. The extras? Lacking and sub-par.

Davis Guggenheim’s 'It Might Get Loud' would want you grab for your guitar if you were making a band and Julian Schnabel’s 'Basquiat' would want you to go and paint a couple of paintings if you were an artist. Unfortunately this magic doesn’t work with Indie Movie. It has the right people in it, the ones who made it, but the camera hasn’t caputerd the right moments. You’ll get first hand footage from guys who have made some of the most relevant games of our age and yet they don’t seem to have anything to say.\nComing back to the inspirational aspect of such movies: (minor spoiler ahead!) if one guy is asked what he’d have done if his game weren’t successful, he says he would have killed himself. How sad is that? What happened to the ‘We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up’ attitude?\nAnd what’s with going about insulting other developers, bringing out specific examples and calling them ‘♥♥♥♥’? That felt immature to say the least.\nSo, the movie suffers greatly from the lack of relevant footage. There was not enough of what I would have wanted to see and there was stuff that I would have left out. Didn’t gain much from seeing this, spare an hour and a half and go play a good game.","February 22, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Indie Game: The Movie contains coarse language, Viewer discretion is advised. Indie Game: The Movie contains love, violence and sadness.\nI give this Movie game review 9 out of 10 because it only talks about 3 games with their creators.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/207080/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","The struggling artist is a trope that we're all familiar with, but most of us don't associate it with video game developers. That is pretty understandable because until 2009 or so the only games we saw were big-budget games being put out by large corporations. With the indie game scene exploding in the last few years, it became much more obvious that there were people making games purely out of passion; people who put their financial stability and reputations on the line to create something beautiful. And that's art.\n\nEnter Indie Game: The Movie, a documentary that sets out to tell a few of these developers' stories. It focuses on Jonathan Blow (Braid), Phil Fish (Fez), and Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes (Super Meat Boy). In the case of Fez and Super Meat Boy, they interview the developers at several important points during the creation of their games. Fez faced a very long development and legal issues that drained Fish. McMillen and Refenes had to crunch to get Super Meat Boy out in time for an Xbox promotion. For all of them, the failure of their games would mean they would probably be finished with game development. Braid was already out by the time the movie was filmed, so Blow mostly talked about what is important to him about independent development. It wasn't nearly as emotionally intense as the other developers' stories, but it helped to frame them.\n\nEven the music was indie game related. Most of it was by Jim Guthrie, and a lot of it was taken straight from Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery. Being that I listen to that soundtrack on a fairly regular basis, it was pretty cool to hear them using the music in such an effecting way.\n\nI was hoping that Indie Game: The Movie would be the kind of documentary I could show my parents to convince them that game development is an art form, but I'm not sure it would work for that. The best audience are definitely gamers; those of us who are already invested in the indie scene will get a lot out of the movie, and gamers who have previously only been exposed to AAA games could be encouraged to expand their horizons. Obviously all three games that were featured have been successful and are very well-known, but during the credits they show many other indie games; even I hadn't heard of most of them, and you can bet I will be looking into them.\n\nThis movie is definitely worth a look for anyone who is remotely interested in video games.","March 20, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is a movie. Yeah, a movie on steam, ikr, but that's it. (That said there could be a mini game hidden somewhere in it... just sayin'...)\nIt follows some indie game creators: Team Meat (Super meat boy), Phil Fish (FEZ), and Jonathan Blow (Braid), during the important moments of their game developement and release.\n\nThe real core of that movie is the relation between these persons and their games. The way they identify themselves to these games, the way their games are basicly their life. Some of these guys go through big buisness issues (I'll try not to spoil), and are even talking about committing suicide or killing someone if they can't manage to release their game or create games anymore !\n\nThat's where you realise how Indie games are magic compared to "big companies games". They're made as a form of art and expression by a few peaple, whereas well... bigger games are made to reach the most peaple possible, that's that simple. Tommy Refenes and Phil Fish even talk about the way Modern Warfare is ♥♥♥♥ and modern Japaneese games aren't what they used to be.\nEach one of the games presented in the movie are highly original: all the video game references and the gameplay of super meat boy, the crazy 2D / 3D thing of FEZ... etc. These guys didn't spend years of their life for nothing.\n\nThe DLC really worth it too, many awesome docs are included into it (the way Ed McMillen reacts to internet trolls, the way the Super meat boy level designer got hacked, some zooms on other Team meat games that look almost even more original than their 2 must known games.. etc). But try not to watch everything in a row, cause they re-use the same ♥♥♥♥ing music everytime and it gets quickly annoying.\n\nIf you like indie games, honestly, watch that movie, its absolutly awesome.","March 3, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Braid, Super Meat Boy, and Fez are not only my favorite video games, but to me they represent a new wave of honesty and purity in a thriving, endlessly growing art form. To see the stories behind the creators of such masterpieces so magnificently fleshed out in this documentary feels like a stroke of good luck on my part and a stroke of genius on Blinkworks part. Their heartfelt DIY production efforts and polished storytelling abilities display a side of new media that has yet to be grasped much at all by the mainstream. The games, the film, and the stories within are all perfect expressions of how the journey of true creators can at times be heartwrenching and painfully human.

This is a movie. Yeah, a movie on steam, ikr, but that's it. (That said there could be a mini game hidden somewhere in it... just sayin'...)\nIt follows some indie game creators: Team Meat (Super meat boy), Phil Fish (FEZ), and Jonathan Blow (Braid), during the important moments of their game developement and release.\n\nThe real core of that movie is the relation between these persons and their games. The way they identify themselves to these games, the way their games are basicly their life. Some of these guys go through big buisness issues (I'll try not to spoil), and are even talking about committing suicide or killing someone if they can't manage to release their game or create games anymore !\n\nThat's where you realise how Indie games are magic compared to "big companies games". They're made as a form of art and expression by a few peaple, whereas well... bigger games are made to reach the most peaple possible, that's that simple. Tommy Refenes and Phil Fish even talk about the way Modern Warfare is ♥♥♥♥ and modern Japaneese games aren't what they used to be.\nEach one of the games presented in the movie are highly original: all the video game references and the gameplay of super meat boy, the crazy 2D / 3D thing of FEZ... etc. These guys didn't spend years of their life for nothing.\n\nThe DLC really worth it too, many awesome docs are included into it (the way Ed McMillen reacts to internet trolls, the way the Super meat boy level designer got hacked, some zooms on other Team meat games that look almost even more original than their 2 must known games.. etc). But try not to watch everything in a row, cause they re-use the same ♥♥♥♥ing music everytime and it gets quickly annoying.\n\nIf you like indie games, honestly, watch that movie, its absolutly awesome.","March 3, 2014","true","4.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This is a rough career path even if it can be personally rewarding. Think about the successful and the damaging behaviours you see in this film, and consider your own approaches to getting your projects done (for example).\n\n- For the love of goodness, can you PLEASE review what 'Code Freeze' means!!!

The documentary is amazing and causes so many different emotions while watching it - personally, I got goose bumps, I laughed, I cried, and I smiled. Watching this documentary really lets viewers feel a connection with the developers, and understand the pros and cons of what they do. Thought the final outcome may be rewarding because they made something of their own which they can relate to but they also sacrifice a lot to do so. To all the indie producers: Good job and keep producing great games! No matter how much I – we gamers may swear at you while we play, the experience and emotions are fun and entertaining.\n\nDisclosure: I may be a bit biased in this review as I love indie games and have helped out a friend with his indie game company but there is a lot of stress, grief and hurdles while producing a game which this documentary portrays quite well. I commend anyone who does it this, as well as recommend to anyone who is aspired to produce a game to do it and never give up – the rewards are worth it.\n\nGame on! ❤","December 30, 2013","true","2.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Indie Game: The Movie is a documentary about 4 of the most famous and successful Indie game designers, and their stories about how they began and where they are today. Their stories are of hard struggles that hindered them and drove them into depression, and how they continued to create their games even when they were on the brink of complete failure and bankruptcy.\nAll 4 stories are linked in the fact that, they all went through good times and bad times. But the main point that was seen in all stories was that these game designers are just one or to people. They kept saying that even if you don't belong to a major company or corporation, that if you put you're mind and entire being into it, you can create something that a lot of people will enjoy and love.\n\nThis documentary was very powerful, Tommy Refenes said that you give up you're life to follow this dream, this passion. And if failure is you're reward then, all that time spent creating and developing a game was all for nothing.\n\nIt's amazing to see and hear from these famous developer just where they started and how they got to where they are today. This is a marvalous documentary and I recommend it. Watch it.","February 8, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

We follow Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes of Team Meat through uncertain times during the development of Super Meat Boy. From the insane three month crunch to finish their project to Microsoft's careless handling of their release, it's a harrowing journey.  We also follow Polytron's Phil Fish and the drama spiral that surrounds him.  He struggles to release Fez, his passion project in development for nearly 5 years, despite a bevy of roadblocks.  Like him or hate him the film provides an honest look at the personal difficulties and pressures that affected the game's turbulent development. Fish seems open and vulnerable here, far separated from the man making headlines for inane, egotistical comments.  There are also interviews with other indie developers, such as Jonathan Blow (Braid) who provides some unique insight into the indie movement and how developers try to connect meaningfully with their audience.\n\nExtras:\nThe extras include a couple of mini-featurettes showing details of the film's production, trailers, a few interviews with other indie developers, and a Super Meat Boy featurette.  But by far the greatest extras are the two commentary tracks.  The developer's commentary provides lots of interesting technical information about the film, behind-the-scenes exclusives, funny anecdotes, and more.  It adds a ton of new information worthy of a second viewing.  The second commentary is done by Edmund and Tommy from Team Meat and it is absolutely hilarious as they riff and joke with each other while watching themselves on-screen.  It is highly entertaining and especially great to see their sense of humor come out despite the somewhat dark and depressing nature of the film.\n\nSpecial Edition:\nThe special edition adds epilogues for the featured developers to see where they are now.  There are also featurettes showcasing some of the criticisms they have received, such as Phil's infamous commentary on Japanese games, and featurettes on Braid, Edmund's other games, and a number of other indie games like Spelunky.  There's over 100 minutes of extra content as well as a hidden game to play.  Team Meat returns with their hilarious commentary on all the new footage and it is just as entertaining as before.  This edition adds Steam achievements and trading cards.\n\nLimited Edition Blu-Ray Box Set:\nOnly available directly from the IGTM website. This includes everything above, a Steam key for IGTM + Special Edition on Steam, a bunch of physical extras, and an exclusive bonus disc. The extra disc adds about 2 more hours of content, including the entire GDC interview panel. There is also a director Q&A from a film screening and a featurette where the directors explain how the movie was made. Finally, there are 8 new developer interviews, including a lengthy discussion with Edmund McMillen about The Binding of Isaac.","August 1, 2013","true","26.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

If there were other documentaries like this, Indie Game: The Movie would be pretty mediocre in comparison. I didn't really learn anything, it was more like watching a really long Nike commercial about overcoming your demons or something basic like that. Also, Phil Fish comes off as a massive ♥♥♥♥ which has caused the gaming hivemind to hate him simply because of how he was portrayed in this film (I'm sure most people would behave this way if they were extremely stressed and became borderline suicidal).

And it all came back to me, the joyful depression it brings after you're done watching it. It's really well directed, writing and camera work are on point. The movie itself is about the life of an independent developer, covering all the anxiety, worries and the fear of failing at your task during the development of a game that makes a big part of you, only because you care that much.\n\nThis film features quite a few indie devs who care a lot about their games, but mostly it's about these guys: Edmund McMillen (whom I am a huge fanboy of, I really love his work), Tommy Refenes (a talented programmer who took a huge part in creation of Super Meat Boy), Jonathan Blow (creator of one of the most successful indie games "Braid"), Phil Fish (creator of Fez, who's known for being kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I can still like him enough) and various other cool people. The film follows trough their everyday lives, childhoods and their work on videogames, capturing a lot of interesting, funny and sad moments.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie I would highly recommend it to you, if you are somewhat interested in indie scene, creative people or videogames in general. It does a really great job on sharing the experience of being a game dev, and can even be really inspiring.

It has tons of happy, sad, dramatic, intense, satisfying and frustrating scenes. This movie will really just take you out of your seat and make you want to develop a video game. This movie isn't just about game designing, it's about depression and what indie developers suffer to make a good game for your entertainment. Whether it be supporters, life threats, depression or pressure, Indie Game: The Movie makes it feel real for the watcher.\n\nIt's all shot in 1080p HD and is great to watch on a monitor/tv in Big Picture mode. Focus is great and the art is just smooth and free-flowing. It's truly amazing that they could capture others' story from the begging to end on these video games being developed and I think this is a great movie for everyone because even though these people may have made just 'video games' that people just look at and think 'what a waste of money and time' it actually tells the story that games are a form of art and not just something you spend cash on and end up playing. The fact everyone of these developers say that they feel an ownership of games and they feel games express them in a way it just shows that these people work harder than most people do in a lifetime.\n\nGo and buy this movie.

The extra content paid for is pretty much commentary, extras, and a "Where's Waldo" style game; It may not be considered a "deal" if extra money is being paid for a free movie, but you can consider it as a way to support everyone involved in the movie, as well as the games the creators of the documentary wanted to include but didn't. That said, the movie is the most emotional documentary about independently developed video games.\n\nYou get to see part of the daily lives of independent game developers and their work lives, which means viewing, at the time, relatively no-name people with hardly a dollar to their name working months to years without any payment, crafting story, audio, visual, gameplay, debugging, and (because they're male) BEARDS! You also see the heartbreaking drama of program builds that won't run properly or all the self-doubt and the UNGODLY amounts of trolling they receive. Everyone's emotions are genuine, and despite the eloquency of Jonathan Blow or the rougher-than-sandpaper scenes of Phil Fish, these aren't scripted events. The movie can bring you to tears and have you cheering for games you may or may not already own.\n\nAs for the added commentary tracks, you get to listen to the director's commentary (or rather the production team's) and listen to them point out some neat factoids, as well as Team Meat. Just. Team Meat. If you bought the bundle for cheap, then the money is more than worth their commentary. The movie overall becomes a comedy, and at times, they're surprised to see scenes in the movie they don't remember being filmed. As caustic as their comments can be, they do so in a somewhat sibling-like jest for their fellow developers. The extra scenes get interesting because, well, Team Meat! They get commentary OVER that stuff as well!\n\nTo point some scenes out in the movie, the directors know how to film dramatic scenes that feel emotional. The positions of the cameras at times tell stories without the faces, such as the awkward foot section that shows the developers' wear over those months. Slice-of-life moments are sprinkled here and there to let the audience further explore the developers' lives, and shots of other games, whether or not they're specifically worked on in the movie, help change the visual pacing of the movie. In terms of audio, there is actually one part early on during Team Meat's commentary track where they rub up against the mic. There are no do-overs with commentary tracks since you're listening to the commenters (Team Meat in this instance) discussing the movie as they're watching it. No re-dos. No Takebacks. The directors have the decency to edit out monetary figures being thrown around though in these tracks, so it's not a simple record-and-paste job.\n\nOh, and if you're going for achievements, Indie Movie: The Game: The Movie is a nice way to learn up on some other indie games that aren't necessarily as popular, but it's not entertaining enough as a game. It does its job though in teaching you different games, but because it's in one artist's style, it may get confusing to see the art. Look up some of those games though, because a few are free and not necessarily a platformer.","June 21, 2014","true","58.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The extra content paid for is pretty much commentary, extras, and a "Where's Waldo" style game; It may not be considered a "deal" if extra money is being paid for a free movie, but you can consider it as a way to support everyone involved in the movie, as well as the games the creators of the documentary wanted to include but didn't. That said, the movie is the most emotional documentary about independently developed video games.\n\nYou get to see part of the daily lives of independent game developers and their work lives, which means viewing, at the time, relatively no-name people with hardly a dollar to their name working months to years without any payment, crafting story, audio, visual, gameplay, debugging, and (because they're male) BEARDS! You also see the heartbreaking drama of program builds that won't run properly or all the self-doubt and the UNGODLY amounts of trolling they receive. Everyone's emotions are genuine, and despite the eloquency of Jonathan Blow or the rougher-than-sandpaper scenes of Phil Fish, these aren't scripted events. The movie can bring you to tears and have you cheering for games you may or may not already own.\n\nAs for the added commentary tracks, you get to listen to the director's commentary (or rather the production team's) and listen to them point out some neat factoids, as well as Team Meat. Just. Team Meat. If you bought the bundle for cheap, then the money is more than worth their commentary. The movie overall becomes a comedy, and at times, they're surprised to see scenes in the movie they don't remember being filmed. As caustic as their comments can be, they do so in a somewhat sibling-like jest for their fellow developers. The extra scenes get interesting because, well, Team Meat! They get commentary OVER that stuff as well!\n\nTo point some scenes out in the movie, the directors know how to film dramatic scenes that feel emotional. The positions of the cameras at times tell stories without the faces, such as the awkward foot section that shows the developers' wear over those months. Slice-of-life moments are sprinkled here and there to let the audience further explore the developers' lives, and shots of other games, whether or not they're specifically worked on in the movie, help change the visual pacing of the movie. In terms of audio, there is actually one part early on during Team Meat's commentary track where they rub up against the mic. There are no do-overs with commentary tracks since you're listening to the commenters (Team Meat in this instance) discussing the movie as they're watching it. No re-dos. No Takebacks. The directors have the decency to edit out monetary figures being thrown around though in these tracks, so it's not a simple record-and-paste job.\n\nOh, and if you're going for achievements, Indie Movie: The Game: The Movie is a nice way to learn up on some other indie games that aren't necessarily as popular, but it's not entertaining enough as a game. It does its job though in teaching you different games, but because it's in one artist's style, it may get confusing to see the art. Look up some of those games though, because a few are free and not necessarily a platformer.","June 21, 2014","true","58.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has tons of happy, sad, dramatic, intense, satisfying and frustrating scenes. This movie will really just take you out of your seat and make you want to develop a video game. This movie isn't just about game designing, it's about depression and what indie developers suffer to make a good game for your entertainment. Whether it be supporters, life threats, depression or pressure, Indie Game: The Movie makes it feel real for the watcher.\n\nIt's all shot in 1080p HD and is great to watch on a monitor/tv in Big Picture mode. Focus is great and the art is just smooth and free-flowing. It's truly amazing that they could capture others' story from the begging to end on these video games being developed and I think this is a great movie for everyone because even though these people may have made just 'video games' that people just look at and think 'what a waste of money and time' it actually tells the story that games are a form of art and not just something you spend cash on and end up playing. The fact everyone of these developers say that they feel an ownership of games and they feel games express them in a way it just shows that these people work harder than most people do in a lifetime.\n\nGo and buy this movie. It's fantastic.\nIt's worth it. And the DLC.","November 23, 2014","true","37.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Ever since the release of Braid, one of the first commercial and financially successful games, there's been a crazy amount of new indie games and developers.\n\nBut what drives these developers, and at what cost ? Indie Game The Movie shows just that. Indie developers shouldn't be compared to big studio companies. It would be easy to do that, but it would also be unfair to these people. These developers all show that it requires an incredible amount of dedication, passion and - sometimes - even isolation to work on their game - AND finish it. It's not just about the money; these games are something personal.

Yes, this is a movie on Steam, but that oddness in no way makes it any less worthwhile and actual is rather a good thing as it makes it easily accessible to the millions that use the service.\n\nThough other games and developers are touched upon, Indie Game is by and large the story of three of the most acclaimed and outspoken indie developers of the last decade: Phil Fish (Fez), Jonathan Blow (Braid), and Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes of Team Meat (Super Meat Boy). Through the years leading up to the release of their respective games, Lisanne Pajot and James Swirsky's film offer a look behind the curtain at the trials and tribulations of independant game creation, and provides a welcome perspective to what at times can seem nothing but praise and accolades with little thought given to just how much work was required for these games to see the light of day.\n\nWhat it does best though is show that these are just normal people doing what they love, and at the same time make it incredibly easy to relate to them. Given their often brass and controversial outward statements (Phil Fish perhaps most among them), it actually came somewhat as a shock to see them in a more personal light away from the press, while learning their stories which were both engaging and even heartwarming having grown up with similar experiences. It's no understatement to say my opinion of them as both creators and persons was drastically changed, and I feel those so quick to anger at what they may have said in the past really ought to take the time to watch this first.\n\nWhether you are a gamer or not (though I'm guessing you are, given where this is posted), Indie Game: The Movie deserves your attention. It's a fascinating look at indie game development and those involved with it, not to mention fantastically edited and accompanied by a great score by indie favorite Jim Guthrie. It won't take much of your time, but could very well completely change your outlook on this medium we all enjoy so much.","November 27, 2013","true","1.8"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

The film follows three indie game developers at different stages of their game development.\n\nThe documentary gives viewers an insight into the indie game scene in North America, as well as the various difficulties faced by indie developers who finance the development of their games from their own pocket.\n\nJonathan Blow's Braid was already a major success by the time the film was made, Team Meat's Super Meat Boy was soon to be released on Xbox Live Arcade, and the anticipated Fez was still not yet complete. We learn a little of the backgrounds, dreams, fears and motivations of these people.\n\nCommentary by Team Meat and the directors, beautiful music.

It follows 3 sets of game developers, one approaching the release of their game, one still in the middle of development, and one after his game has released. It provides an objective, unbiased picture of it's subjects.\n\nThe title, however, is misleading. The movie purports to explore independent game development, and it does give the viewer enough context to understand the environment. Ultimately, this is not the focus of the movie. This is a movie about art and artists, particularly those who are good at making art but not at presenting it or reacting to what they've made. It shows how important emotional management is in the act of making art, before, during, and especially after the art itself is done.\n\nThat's not to say indie game development as a business is not worth exploring, but ultimately I think this movie choosing to be a character piece works to its benefit. I would and do recommend this to any artist I know, in any field--the lessons it teaches about creativity and introspection is applicable to any field, not just game development, and that is why it is such a good movie.","February 13, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Here is my new review, after watching the movie numerous times.\n\nIndie Game the Movie is a great movie. But it isn't amazing nor is it as heartfelt as it's made out to think. Let's start with the  PROS AND CONS\n\nPros:\n-With the exception of Phil Fish (Who was a total wreck in this movie), the main subjects in this movie were all likeable to a capacity.\n-Great presentation, espicially with something with a not as large budget of about 200k.\n-It's soundtrack is probably the best in any documentary I've watched.\n-The Steam version includes a bonus minigame, achievements, and it's DLC includes special features.\n-It's special features are also willy neato.\n-It's Video Player isn't bad at all and it's serviceble.\n\nCons:\n-The movie dragged on too long with boring bits. When Phil Fish talks about his childhood, it's later in the movie. When Tommy talked about his childhood, it was earlier. It's all split up and the reason why something about their childhood and their story with video games seems a bit boring to watch is because it isn't placed that well in the movie.\n-The scrappy underdog narrative of the movie (Defined by Super Bunnyhop) is while good for what it is isn't necessarily an ideal hook for the movie. It presents the other con above and some of the most awkward scenes in the movie is when it's clear that these guys probably aren't interesting to follow around.\n\n*REVIEW IN PROGRESS*","December 19, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It's a documentary about indie game developers.\n\nIt gives you a tremendous insight into how games are made and the frustration and sacrifice that indie game developers go through.\n\nMany could get good, well paying jobs in major game companies but instead they followed the unbeaten path and went for their  their passion instead of money and prestige. Some were living in poverty before their game was released. One even said, he hated the idea that he wouldn't have the freedom of doing what he wants if he had worked for some major game company.\n\nindie game developers are truly an inspiration to us all.","June 22, 2013","true","3.4"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","5","0","1"

I know Indie Gaming (r) is in vogue right now, but this is an affront to that prestigious pantheon of games (stretching back through the ages to Braid). No gameplay to speak of whatsoever; I thought this would be like The Walking Dead, with QTEs and moral choices and that, but you literally don't have to press a button to progress - in fact, the only major command you have STOPS THE STORY ENTIRELY!  The narrative can be applauded for jumping about a bit, and they've created some entertaining characters, but it's handling of mutliple characters is no better than Donkey Kong 64s. It is linear, and I was offered no choices in the direction it went; the only significant decision I made that affected the rest of the narrative was to switch the game off. I for one am outraged that I got this for pennies off a Humble Bundle. This only gets 8/10.","December 17, 2013","false","3.9"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","10","26","0","0"

Because it's really worth it, see the expression and feelings from the Dev's, the work hard, the process. It makes you stop to think "hey wait, it was really that hard and lot of efort for it?" and yea that is.\n\nGood job to the director and the team to follow and give a chance to the indie dev's express themselves.

Maybe not "better" than traditional art...looking at most non-interactive art is passive and mental and can lead to an emotional experience. But there are moments in some games where you hit all those descriptive adjectives and through the tactile manipulation of your character you achieve an amazing sense of accomplishment as well.\n\nThis movie tells the story of a few independent developers and the emotional experience each went through trying to get their game published. It's much more than a "gaming" movie...it's really nothing more than people pursuing their dreams and allowing all of us to share in them. It's really a great little movie about a few little great games and the souls who built them.\n\nPersonal note: I've done a little of this in my past making levels for a game my son started and I have to say on a really small scale, I completely understand what these guys went through.","June 13, 2012","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They all too often fall prey to the tropes of the genre, feeling either too clinical or too emotional for the viewer to glean any information from them. Indie Game: The Movie falls into the latter camp. This does not detract from the film, though, as it is a film that is fundamentally about emotion. It is a glimpse into the mind of the troubled artists behind the games that we love. It is a sincere, and successful, attempt to give the viewer a glimpse into the mind of a designer and an understanding of what it means to be an artist. The love and dedication that one has for their work, the way in which the designers see their games as their own babies, the way these people’s work not only fills their lives but becomes them; all covered in the movie. This is one of my favorite documentaries, and even one of my favorite films, of all times. It is unblinking in it’s portrayal of the torture and suffering a creator of games, or any other medium, subjects themselves to so that their work can be subjected to the masses.","December 30, 2013","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically it's the story behind the guys that made Braid, Super Meat Boy, and Fez, and recounts all the trials and tribulations that these developers had to go through for making their games into a reality.\n\nA lot of what they said (especially Ed's scenes) really struck me in the heart, because you can really tell they are pouring their heart and soul into their games, but it's just that you don't really have a clearer view than what you see in this documentary as it's recording them as they first released their games, not knowing if it was going to be a flop or passable or the next big thing.\n\nWhat a lot of people don't see past this documentary is to fathom just the sheer amount of indie developers that didn't make it in the industry, to the point where you have never even heard of some of their titles.

The title is a little misleading as this film doesn't actually focus on the creative process involved in coming up with an idea, fleshing it out, then developing that idea, with all the hiccups and walls along the way. Instead IGTM is more of a documentary on the game-makers themselves and what drove them to become game developers, neuroses and all. Then, they address what it's like preparing to release a finished product to the anticipating public - only to be beset upon by technical and/or social problems from all sides with all the stresses that come with. It's emotionally harrowing just to watch, let alone be actively involved in.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the camerawork and audio is really great, the perspectives of the three different developers all synergise really well; and Team Meat's audio commentary track is just hilarious to listen to.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend forking out the money to buy this.

Indie Game: The Movie goes into detail about several Indie Titles(featuring Super Meat Boy, Fez, and Braid) that have gotten a lot of hype in popularity in the past year, the developers' struggling and touching development recorded. They got misunderstood, they got ignored, but finally they succeed. I cried for countless times.\n\nIndie Game: The movie is not a video game, but it's about video games, it's about being artistic and doing your own thing, about failure and success, about living your dreams. This film would give motivation to a dead man.\n\n+ Much inspirational\n+ Nice footage\n+ Strong connection with gamers\n+ Authentic, subtle record of indie devs","August 6, 2013","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though programming is not my current profession it truly shaped me as an individual and how I approach life in general. The grind in hopes of payoff, the life you sacrifice due to the almost addictive culture of being decent. Perhaps this doesn't make since but this film truly captured a pure moment of nostalgia for me. Not seeking to be the best but just good enough to produce something many people will like and a passion which very few can relate to. If you like video games or feel passionate about anything in life I believe this film is for you. If there is one thing I would have liked to see more of is the personal issues which can become road blocks while you are pursuing something.

The title is a little misleading as this film doesn't actually focus on the creative process involved in coming up with an idea, fleshing it out, then developing that idea, with all the hiccups and walls along the way. Instead IGTM is more of a documentary on the game-makers themselves and what drove them to become game developers, neuroses and all. Then, they address what it's like preparing to release a finished product to the anticipating public - only to be beset upon by technical and/or social problems from all sides with all the stresses that come with. It's emotionally harrowing just to watch, let alone be actively involved in.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the camerawork and audio is really great, the perspectives of the three different developers all synergise really well; and Team Meat's audio commentary track is just hilarious to listen to.\n\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend forking out the money to buy this.

I'm a huge fan of both documentaries and indie gaming so when this became availible as part of the Humble Bundle it had me reaching for the ol' bankcard before I'd even seen the other games included. I've always been interested into the development aspect behind games but hadn't really researched it in any depth and aside from the childhood dreams of one day making games for a living I really didn't know much about development. This movie interviews some of the most prominent people in the Indie Game movement there's the creator of Braid, the creators of Super Meat Boy and the creator of the long awaited title Fez. It shows the sheer turmoil these men put themselves through in-terms of working ludicrously long hours trying to create the next build of their game or even just trying to squash bugs that have been putting their stress levels at all an all time high for months.

They all too often fall prey to the tropes of the genre, feeling either too clinical or too emotional for the viewer to glean any information from them. Indie Game: The Movie falls into the latter camp. This does not detract from the film, though, as it is a film that is fundamentally about emotion. It is a glimpse into the mind of the troubled artists behind the games that we love. It is a sincere, and successful, attempt to give the viewer a glimpse into the mind of a designer and an understanding of what it means to be an artist. The love and dedication that one has for their work, the way in which the designers see their games as their own babies, the way these people’s work not only fills their lives but becomes them; all covered in the movie. This is one of my favorite documentaries, and even one of my favorite films, of all times. It is unblinking in it’s portrayal of the torture and suffering a creator of games, or any other medium, subjects themselves to so that their work can be subjected to the masses.","December 30, 2013","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe not "better" than traditional art...looking at most non-interactive art is passive and mental and can lead to an emotional experience. But there are moments in some games where you hit all those descriptive adjectives and through the tactile manipulation of your character you achieve an amazing sense of accomplishment as well.\n\nThis movie tells the story of a few independent developers and the emotional experience each went through trying to get their game published. It's much more than a "gaming" movie...it's really nothing more than people pursuing their dreams and allowing all of us to share in them. It's really a great little movie about a few little great games and the souls who built them.\n\nPersonal note: I've done a little of this in my past making levels for a game my son started and I have to say on a really small scale, I completely understand what these guys went through.","June 13, 2012","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically it's the story behind the guys that made Braid, Super Meat Boy, and Fez, and recounts all the trials and tribulations that these developers had to go through for making their games into a reality.\n\nA lot of what they said (especially Ed's scenes) really struck me in the heart, because you can really tell they are pouring their heart and soul into their games, but it's just that you don't really have a clearer view than what you see in this documentary as it's recording them as they first released their games, not knowing if it was going to be a flop or passable or the next big thing.\n\nWhat a lot of people don't see past this documentary is to fathom just the sheer amount of indie developers that didn't make it in the industry, to the point where you have never even heard of some of their titles.  As someone who does eventually want to make their own game, no matter how big or how small I'm planning it to be, this documentary really showed me a glimpse of how much sacrifice you need to gamble on making a game.","January 20, 2013","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"

I'm a huge fan of both documentaries and indie gaming so when this became availible as part of the Humble Bundle it had me reaching for the ol' bankcard before I'd even seen the other games included. I've always been interested into the development aspect behind games but hadn't really researched it in any depth and aside from the childhood dreams of one day making games for a living I really didn't know much about development. This movie interviews some of the most prominent people in the Indie Game movement there's the creator of Braid, the creators of Super Meat Boy and the creator of the long awaited title Fez. It shows the sheer turmoil these men put themselves through in-terms of working ludicrously long hours trying to create the next build of their game or even just trying to squash bugs that have been putting their stress levels at all an all time high for months. This documentary had me totally captivated from start to finish and I highly recommend you give it a watch.","January 12, 2013","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They all too often fall prey to the tropes of the genre, feeling either too clinical or too emotional for the viewer to glean any information from them. Indie Game: The Movie falls into the latter camp. This does not detract from the film, though, as it is a film that is fundamentally about emotion. It is a glimpse into the mind of the troubled artists behind the games that we love. It is a sincere, and successful, attempt to give the viewer a glimpse into the mind of a designer and an understanding of what it means to be an artist. The love and dedication that one has for their work, the way in which the designers see their games as their own babies, the way these people’s work not only fills their lives but becomes them; all covered in the movie. This is one of my favorite documentaries, and even one of my favorite films, of all times. It is unblinking in it’s portrayal of the torture and suffering a creator of games, or any other medium, subjects themselves to so that their work can be subjected to the masses.","December 30, 2013","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It mostly wears its biases on its sleeves and lets the viewer come to their own conclusion as to the validity of its subjects' attitudes, which is definitely a plus. It's very easy to perceive it, perhaps, as too twee or saccarine, and it can get a bit pretentious in moments, but it's finely edited and if you have an interest in the people who make videogames, you'll enjoy this, at least in a "see how the sausage is made" kind of way. Even if you hate the people this film is seemingly about, it seems disingenuous to me to dismiss the craft of the product due to a distaste of the subjects.\n\nAs a plus, Boston's favourite son Jonathan Holmes is in it and he is a sexy boy.","August 11, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I've actually watched it - and I'm not a bit disappointed. A little insight from the world of indie dev's will be helpful for those who are in for game development and interesting for those who like to play games. The only thing that bothers me after finishing it is the fact that in this movie were presented devs, who sacrificed everything, who spent 24/7 on making the game. I understand that this is the shortest way to success but it would have been better if there was at least one example of the developer, who actually made cool game living the normal life. But it's just my personal opinion, the movie is great all the same.\n\nThere were funny moments, there were moments that made me sad. Of course there were moments that made me think - about game development, about the direction I'm heading in this sphere, about life itself. I guess, this movie was quite an informative one, which I highly recommend to everyone.\n\nPS. Oh and Indie Game: The Movie: The Game! There is guide on Steam, which helps you finish this game in a few minutes - and it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ broken! So I wanted to cheat (shame on me!) - and I failed, so I had to complete this game myself. And gods it was challenging - and it was so cool to succeed. So I recommend, if this guide is fixed - don't use it! Finish the game by yourself! It brings a lot of satisfaction (yeah, and quite a lot of frustration :D).","June 22, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
