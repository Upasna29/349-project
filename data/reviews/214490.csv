"http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendoom/recommended/214490/","legendoom","Legendoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/legendoom/","202 products in account","If there’s one game this year that I absolutely must give my faithfulness award to, it’s probably Alien: Isolation. I’m honestly having trouble thinking of a team of developers who clearly love the source material of their game and want to pay it an honest respect *more* than the developers behind Isolation at Creative Assembly. So much so that absolutely nothing is misplaced, although a few things are mishandled. Everything in Isolation is almost perfectly sculpted and placed to the point where you never have your immersion broken or get taken out of the story, and it’s crystal clear that Creative Assembly wanted to paint Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger’s original vision in a way that did it honor. And they have.\n\nThe largest parts of that immersion can be boiled down to three features: graphic design, audio, and mechanics. Graphically, the game is absolutely stunning. Isolation aims to recreate Scott’s original style in the first Alien of “low fi sci fi”, and does it with perfection. Analog computers and cameras and voice recorders and huge, bulky spacesuits with 80’s GUIs. Believe me when I say that this is by far and away the most accurate and stellar portrayal of Alien in any other medium ever made. Second, the sound design: also, absolutely fantastic. Isolation uses the original score from the movie combined with eerie, high-tone background music that’s contrasted against it, and creates a mix of something that both astounds and terribly unnerves you at the same time. And finally, the mechanics, which, while they are a bit simplistic, lend themselves to the scenery that much more. There’s a lot of button pushing and primordial hacking and lever pulling in Isolation, which does wear thin after a while considering the standard formula is “get to location X” while avoiding everything in your way, but fortunately, this is circumvented by Isolation’s greatest strength: it’s fear factor.\n\nIt’s been said that the best horror games have you just as terrified when something isn’t happening as when something is happening. Silent Hill 2 understood this. Amnesia: TDD understood this. And I’m glad to say Isolation does as well. The sound of the Alien crawling in the vents above you is constant, as well as the subliminal noises and creaks and bangs that keep your skin crawling, making you never aware when the Alien will drop down. And when it is on the screen, it’s fantastic. Creative Assembly have designed Giger’s Alien (there’s only one in this game) with virtually no scripting and mostly organic AI, creating the effective illusion that this is a real, breathing predator that searches rooms and doubles back and reacts to sound. It’s genuinely terrifying when you’re hiding in a locker, barely a metre away from the beast, knowing that if it turns right, it might hear you breathing or your motion tracker beeping, rip off the locker door and end you.\n\nThat being said, with a lack of scripting comes some annoying and downright frustrating moments.The Alien can sometimes spend three or four minutes searching the room you’re hiding in and leaving you no chance to get away before it leaves, and other times it may just drop out of a vent right in front of you and leave you no chance to escape. And given that Isolation’s style of hacking and even saving requires you to leave yourself vulnerable for a few seconds (which, to be fair, does add to the horror factor), the game can be very unfair with how quickly and without warning you can be killed. This is both the greatest strength and weakness of the game: *NOTHING* you do is not potentially dangerous in some way. Sprinting down a hallway, using a save point, hacking a door, building an item... everything opens you up to a horrible death, and while that is incredibly atmospheric and nerve-wracking, at least a few times during your playthrough, you'll probably face a very unfair end. And the horror factor does tend to drain in the second half, when you're given a reliable method of defense against the Alien that keeps it at bay, and there's always someone talking in your ear, in contrast to the first half, where you're almost entirely alone and you have only molotovs to slow the Alien down, which are hard to craft, minimal and difficult to aim. So I feel the game could have benefitted by giving us fewer methods to defend ourselves.\n\nAll that said, Isolation’s core is a solid, terrifying experience of a tride and true survival horror. It flies its colours well, and executes its design almost perfectly. There are some issues with the story what with it being very, very long, and the fact that you seem to have won multiple times before the game yanks the rug out from underneath you and tells you there’s a few more hours to go could be seen as annoying by some (though for me, I felt the game is paced and spread out enough that it was negligible). However, I felt that even getting to a save point in this game was a minor victory, and it makes the terrifying moments shine as bright as a star. Isolation’s concept is fantastic, its execution solid and its atmosphere astounding.\n\nFor any Alien fan, for any survival horror connoisseur, and for any curious gamer that has enough money to reupholster their computer chair, this is a must-buy.\n\nMy Rating: 9/10","October 6, 2014","true","39.2"," 1,606 of 1,740 people (92%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","92","606","1","18","29"

Alien: Isolation attempts to change that by going the route of Amnesia: The Dark Descent, by  not  giving you pulse rifles or smart guns, and making the Xenomorph  not  die from small-arms fire. In other words, in this game your best friend is silence and the nearest table or locker. If this sounds like your kind of horror survival game, read on.\n\nCampaign The events of the game take place fifteen years after the events of the first Alien movie, and you play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, the protagonist from the aforementioned movie. Amanda is working as an engineer in the sector where the Nostromo – the ship her mother was traveling with – went missing, and when approached by a Weyland-Yutani employee – Samuels – who informs her that its flight recorder has been found, she quickly accepts his offer to come along and recover it.\n\nThis takes you to Sevastopol, the space station housing the only trace Amanda has of her mother, and where she will play a deadly cat and mouse game with the same terrors that tormented her mother.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound Alien: Isolation is a stealth game that revolves around your ability to calmly assess the situation and take the best course of action to deal with the problem at hand in a manner that won't catch the attention of the Xenomorph. If you go into this game with a twitchy trigger finger and hopes of bumrushing it to the end, you're gonna have a bad time. Most of your time in the game will be spent hiding in lockers and under tables, clutching your motion tracker close and hoping that the Xenomorph didn't hear or see you.\n\nA Xenomorph that, by the way, has no set paths or routes, instead going wherever it pleases, whenever it pleases, but usually drawn in by noises, which only adds to the terror this creature will instill in you. The game includes a crafting system which allows you to craft items to distract your enemies with, but it is in no way required. Over-reliance on your distraction tools can even be disadvantageous.\n\nAnd if you want to battle your friends in who can score the highest, there's Survivor Mode. This pits you against the Xenomorph in a small area from which you need to escape, and you'll earn points depending on how many optional objectives you completed and the time you took to escape, which then get uploaded to the Leaderboards. The Xenomorph is extremely aggressive in this mode, and you too need to be more daring and aggressive to counter the timer.\n\nVisually, the game is absolutely gorgeous, and you owe it to yourself to play it on the highest settings. From beads of sweat on the foreheads of survivors to the best looking fire effects I have seen to date, it is truly a feast for the eyes.\n\nThe sounds are phenomenal across the board, and you really  should   need   a good sound system for this game, certainly with surround capabilities, and preferably headphones. Listening for the Xenomorph is far more reliable – and terrifying – than your motion tracker.\n\nFlaws The unpredictability of the Xenomorph can in certain areas mean you get stuck in lockers for long periods of time, especially on higher difficulty levels. You eventually learn to outmaneuver it, but before you do that it can feel like a Locker Simulator.\nAnother flaw, if you want to call it that, is that while the environments are beautifully crafted you won't have much time to appreciate them due to the omnipresent Xenomorph and other enemies.\n\nIn conclusion Alien Isolation  recaptures the feeling of the originial Alien movie exceptionally well, complete with the entire station interior looking like that found on the Nostromo, from the doors to beds to the computers. The feeling of isolation and vulnerability are ever-present and you will be tip-toeing through the levels and duck under the nearest table when you hear the signature noises from the ventilation shafts. If you've never known terror in a video game, this game will change that.\n\n\nRated 9/10 - This is what a survival horror should be like.","June 21, 2015","true","19.0"," 320 of 330 people (97%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","97","320","330","19","8"

The "Pucker Factor" is off the charts insane!  The music alone can drive you crazy with apprehension.  It gets so intense that I have to stop playing just get get back into a relaxed frame of mind.

As a game it is an incredibly stressful experience, quite possibly the most nerve-shredding I have yet experienced in my thirty odd years of gaming. It's also a pure master-class in adrenalin pumping terror that plays its audience like a violin and from the very moment you set foot on the doomed space station, the Sevastopol, you are thrust into a never-ending nightmare that is heightened to a fever pitch thanks to some incredibly polished production values that recreate a visually impressive playground that matches the set design of the original 1979 sci-fi horror classic to the tee, coupled with an equally impressive audio soundtrack that brings the stations every creak and groan to life with a thundering bass. Pure dread will be drilled into your bones turning your blood ice-cold when you finally hear the Xenomorph for the first time using the vents and ducts as her mode of transport and the sounds the Alien emits when nearby is blood-curdling. Alien: Isolation is hands down one of the most visually and aurally impressive games of 2014.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346710776\nAlien: Isolation's opening segments are utterly fantastic. They are slow, deliberate and methodical, building tension like a slowly tightening vice. For starters you won't actually encounter a Xenomorph for the first two or three hours of game-play whilst you explore the vessel completing seemingly mundane tasks and the wait before you get your first glimpse of the lethal and savage predator on-board is excruciating as each and every slow step you take, takes you deeper and deeper into the bowels of the Sevastopol and closer to an unmitigated terror that when unleashed will wreck havoc on your nerves. Be prepared because you are going to need nerves of steel when the Xenomorph is finally let loose to begin her hunt.\n\nAlien: Isolation cetainly knows how to fill its players with a keen sense of dread. To put it bluntly - the experience of playing Alien: Isolation is like being strapped into the worlds longest roller-coaster ride. The pacing in Alien: Isolation is one of its biggest strengths. Creative Assembly seem to have realized that less is more when it comes to scaring you so don't expect to be continuously hounded by the Alien. The Xenomorph tends to come and go during your explorations and is often missing for long stretches of game-time. Framing the game in such a way was a very smart move by Creative Assembly. Rather than have you continuously playing hide and seek with the monster, which would have had the reverse effect of diminishing the terror, these bursts of flight or fight are made even more impressive because of the nature of them being so unscripted.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=347149567\nAnd speaking of unscripted - I found the Alien A.I. incredible. No two deaths or experiences where ever the same as the A.I adapts to your playstyle. Apart from a few scripted events the Alien A.I. is pretty much left to its own devices and generally comes rushing towards any noise no matter where you may be. This is not a game to be blazed through or you will die repeatedly. There are a lot of sequences where the ships alarm system gets triggered and they are terrifying in their own right because you know the inevitable is going to happened as your fear gives rise to complete panic as you rush about to trying to move out of confined and well lit spaces into the shadows, under tables and into cabinet spaces as you hear the thundering movement of the beast in the corridors and vents above you zoning in on the sound of the triggered alarm.\n\nThis level of uncertainty to each encounter only makes each engagement more terrifying than the last as you can never quite predict when your next confrontation with her is going to take place. You will need to be on guard and ready at all times and for the most part playing Alien: Isolation is like walking a tightrope that is constantly threatening to split apart because of the constant threats thrown your way in the form of other human NPCS who are just as jittery and scared as you are, fighting for their own survival. You will also encounter many droids, called Worker Joes, that seem to have taken on a menacing life of their own.\n\nWhile we are at it we may as well discuss the elephant standing in the room and get it out of the way once and for all. Alien: Isolation is nothing like Colonial Marines (that Alien wreck of a game that left fans infuriated). This is the beast in all of its full and terrifying glory as envisioned all those years ago by Ridley Scott and H.R Giger in the original 1979 film version. Alien: Isolation is truly the best thing to hit the Alien franchise since Alien itself.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=347123041\nThe game is not perfect, however, and the plodding middle-section where your biggest threat is the androids is bit of a tiresome chore to get through. It's an incredibly lengthy portion with muddled objectives and a maze-like map that confounds more than it enlightens. Throughout this section your map is pretty much useless in detailing a path to your objective and some of the objectives are incredibly obscure and not very well explained. This was my least favorite part of an otherwise stellar game and it really felt more like padding than anything else.\n\nAlien: Isolation is the game Alien fans have been waiting eons for and it does not disappoint. Creative Assembly have done an amazing job because they have crafted a tense and terrifying adventure that encapsulates the entire experience of the original film even if it falters somewhat in the middle. As a life-long Alien fan, Alien: Isolation does more than pay lip-service to its fans - it gives those fans an out-of-this-world experience that delivers on almost all of its promises and is an experience you won't be forgetting anytime soon. Alien: Isolation, if you don't own it already, should be bought and played immediately or if you are a bit strapped for cash placed at the top of your wishlist, in fact I would even advocate begging (something I normally never do) for a copy from family and friends alike if you are in a tight bind.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","November 29, 2014","true","37.6"," 768 of 881 people (87%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","87","768","881","82","39"

The parts of this review I edit will be in bold.\n\n2 hard, 2 sp00ki and 2 long. -11/10-IGN\n\nSeriously though, boys and girls, this is it. This is the alien game we have always wanted and so much more. You really need to play for yourself to REALLY know whether you'll like it or not, but here's my Pros/cons so far:\n\nPros:\n\n-Atmosphere. It's tense, tight and  always having you check your corners. This is how an Alien game should be made, you NEVER fell safe, and I for one sigh with pleasure when I see another survivor, friendly or not, because either way it's them or the Alien, and I'd prefer them.\nThere's a couple of jump scares, some effective and some not, but the game in whole isn't going for that "scary ♥♥♥♥ your pants" theme, it's more "edge of your seat extreme tense intensifies".\n\n-The graphics. Are they amazing? No, but they are not bad, at all. They are pretty good, and the "70's" feel the devs were going for works and fits perfect in the world the dev team created. Film grain is set o max as a defult, but I prefer it without it on.\nThe further into the game I got, the more I liked the graphics and the better the seemed. The whole 70's Alien theme they were going for really is amazing, and they nailed it perfectly.\n\n-Controls. They feel great, they are responsive and so far from what i've played, it's never felt as though i've died because of poor controls.\nI've seen people complaining about the UI, but i honestly think it is fine, and the only reason I'd see them complaing about it would be if they were using a game pad. keyboard and mouse works nice with the menus.\n\n-Optimization. I'm playing with everything on ULTRA and i'm getting a very easy 65+ fps.\nSpecs\nIntel i3 duel core (with quad hyperthreading)\nRadeon 7700 HD series (4gb VRAM)\n8gb ram\n\nNot a very powerful computer, and this game STILL runs great.\n\n-The Alien- Ho-ly ♥♥♥♥. Looks amazing, sounds amazing, moves amazing, is amazing.\n\n-Audio. Not much to say. Sounds really good, the original score reworked to fit the game sounds amazing, the ambiet sounds are great. Just all round good job.\nThere are times when the soundtrack is a little loud and you can't hear the alien, but it doesn't worry me since the soundtrack really is just that good.\n\n-The story. i haven't finished it yet, but from what i've played so far it's pretty good, don't really want to give any spoilers.\nSince I just finished and I still think it's pretty good the whole way through, although once you get the flamethower it sometimes makes you feel that you're a lot more powerful then you actually are. That can be a good or a bad thing, but it just seems like the game starts to forget what it's about.\n\n-Content. There's a lot in here so far. Besides the main story which is apparently 15 hours long, there's the extremely difficult survival mode and for those who preordered theres the DLC's. It's nice. I like.\n\n-The lighting. Yes, the lighting needs it's own point. The lighting is seriously gorgeous, and captures the nature of the game, dark and gritty, with flickering/swaying lights.\n\nCons:\n\n-Bugs. Yes, there are bugs like always. Although i'm sure the will eventually be ironed you, there are some pretty stupid ones that you'd think they would notice before release. So far i've seen the transit trams take me to my destination, not let me out for a solid 5 seconds, even though the door is open. I've also seen a gun floating in the air. Nothing game breaking though.I found a couple of serious issues, such as constant crashes(to the desktop), more common when I go to load without actually dying(if I wanted to redo an objective in a different way) the game would just crash.\n\n-The Alien. Hear me out. Although the alien is a sick ♥♥♥♥,  eventually it does lose it's 'mojo' once you figure out it's basic routine. Hear sound/see movement, hide from it for a bit, it'll go away repeat, but don't let this fool you, the mother ♥♥♥♥er never stops you from sitting back in your chair.\n\n-Now this, THIS is what really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. The ENDING(NO SPOILERS). ♥♥♥♥ you CA, ♥♥♥♥ you SEGA, ♥♥♥♥ you CA. Biggest sequal/DLC bait I have ever seen. It isn't AS big of a deal for me since I have the DLC pass, so if they DO decide to continue with the story in DLC, I guess i'll have access to it, but what about those who didn't have the money for the pass you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? It really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nJust a couple of things about the game I see a lot of people complaing about:\n-No, they Alien does NOT cheat. Besides the fact it can seeyou, hear you AND as far as I know SMELL you, the closer you are to the alien, the more likley you are to be caught.\n\n-The Alien does seems to teleport to you at times (for instance you might hear it jump into a vent, you get out of your hiding spot then it randomly sees you). This might be an issue, but i honeslt y think there is a reason for that, and that reason is answered near the end of the game (I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't finished the game, so at the end of this review i'll put why I think this is after three lines of **).\n\n-THE ALIEN CAN HEAR YOUR MOTION TRACKER.\n\n-As far as i'm concerned the alien can also hear you getting in and out of vents/closets/cabnets.\n\n-♥♥♥♥ the ending\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.\n\nSPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT\n*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\n\nThe fact that there is more than one alien on board could be the reason for this, although it still doesn't make that much sense, but it's just a thought.","October 6, 2014","true","32.1"," 598 of 687 people (87%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","87","598","687","22","30"

Everything looked like it had been dreamt up by someone in the 70s trying to predict what the future would look like and for old fans like me, it worked perfectly, even down to the addition of a slight film grain (which could be turned off).\n\nThe game itself was terrifying, with the alien AI being brutally good at stalking you, and although there are a few places it feels too scripted, the general feeling you get is one of facing a supremely good predator who is learning your movements just as much as you are trying to learn his.\n\nThe game could probably have been a little shorter and still been great, but in general I recommend this game without hesitation to any horror game fans, or any old timers who remember the original Alien movie with fondness (or terror).\n\nHere is my full video review, but be warned, it contains some spoilers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLyxtFoG0bU","January 1, 2015","true","30.7"," 229 of 240 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","229","240","8","4"

But the premise of being there, personally facing one of cinemas greatest creatures seemed just terrifying and not much else.\n\nIn a funny turn of events I got to see ALIENS (1986) on the big screen and on that very same weekend the Humble Store offered A:I for a low-low price and being all hyped from the movie and Sigourney Weavers kickass performance, my curiosity got me registered on the Sevastopol space station.\n\nLet me just say that I am very positively surprised how much I actually enjoyed A:I. Basically, you play hide and seek with the xenomorph, gradually building up an arsenal of tools for distraction and destruction as well as uncovering a lame plot about corporations willing to end hundreds of lifes for profit. Seriously, the plot is just a megamix of every idea the original two movies had and you can sense the plottwists hours before they happen.\n\nGameplay consists of finding safe and secure areas, checking out waypoints and avoiding any actions that draw attention to your position.  A:I demands both patience AND nerves of steel. It is also a game about choices and deadly consequences should you choose poorly. In order to help you make those decisions, Creative Assembly gave you a bunch of tools - like the motion tracker and an excellent map. However, your most important asset for survival are your ears. Up to this point, I haven't played a game that put so much emphasis on its sound as a means of navigation and well, deciding what to do next. The xenomorph makes a lot of distinct noises that allow you to "read" the current situation (like: is it even there, is it currently in the vents, is it busy murdering other people or is it actively hunting you). You may be just running back and forth between checkpoints, restoring power and opening doors - but it sure feels intense. And they managed to do that without artificially crippling your actions - so, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to take control out of the players hands and make matters more "EXCITING!" by making them more awkward to handle.\n\nAnother reason why A:I works better than other games of this genre that I have tried, is the fact that you know A LOT about your surroundings and most of the imminent dangers in them. In fact, I love the level design for the most part - it strikes the perfect ballance between being linear but allowing you a couple of different tactical options and routes to take. Mind you, there are exceptions to this and later levels have a tendency to introduce choke points where you are forced to encounter hostiles - but the first half was really great. In fact, all levels do a splendid job of conveying that you are being inside the bowels of a massive, man-made, mechanical mega-structure floating in space. All areas feel like real places that had a purpose before they were abandoned (or... shall we say... redecorated by certain creatures) - there are floor markings and signs helping you navigate and further turning Sevastopol into a place that makes sense, becomes believable.\n\nWhat really sets A:I apart from the competetion (and is ultimately the reason why I got it in the first place) is its license and the way that license was used. A:I is all about atmosphere and looks as well as sounds fantastic - Creative Assembly did a near flawless job of recreating the ALIEN universe aesthetic of retro-futurstic spaceship corridors, computer terminals and heavy machinery. Some of the corridors look so great, you can almost feel the damp air, the heat of fires, and the frizzle of electric sparks on your skin. Now you combine the insane artdirection with the awesome sounddesign and you got your current benchmark for every upcoming science fiction game. All those rumbling sounds, sirens, shutters and alarms - they really make Sevastopol feel alive. As much as people praise (and fear) the xenomorph, for me the real star of the game is the space station itself.\n\nTalking about fear, I actually didn't find the game to be as frightening as everyone makes it out to be. In fact, I was more afraid of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Working Joes (because harming them makes either a lot of noise or isn't very healthy, and it gets worse when they start wearing hazmat-suits). I think the game is rather light on jumpscares and shockvalue - if you pay attention and move cautiously. This might be different on harder difficulties - but then again, it "just" insta-kills you even more  - so, what is there to be afraid of? And this doesn't mean this game isn't exciting or intense -  it is the thrill of getting caught instead of being paralyzed with fear.\n\nFinally, there are a bunch of issues I have with the game that need to be mentioned as well.\nFirst of all: the anti-aliasing in A:I sucks. I am talking PS2-era jaggies here - not cool. Also, the lighting did wonders on the levels - but did not really work too well on the Alien itself, it looks kinda flat - even though the model seems to be pretty detailed - you just never see much of that quality.\n\nOccasionally I had a bunch of clipping issues - the worst was when the alien suddenly clipped into me while I was hiding under a desk, making the ai go berserk and immediatly kill me. There were a bunch of other weird occurences, mostly when Androids were around - if they spotted me and the Alien was around, the xeno would never calm down and suddenly know exactly where I was, almost like androids and alien shared the same info. What made matters worse was that I wanted to open a vent security door (from inside the vent) and all enemies "knew" exactly where I was (even though that was impossible) - they just couldn't get to me because of that security door, but once it was open the alien took a  dive straight into the vent, three times in a row. In the end I snuck through the "harder part" of that area without encountering either Alien or Android. Weird and annoying.\n\nAt times the controls are a bit finnicky, running (with the Alien in hot pursuit) into an elevator, I died because despite the control buttons being in the center of my screen, the button prompt didn't show up because I wasn't properly looking at them - same goes for some vents, standing exactly in front of them won't do - you gotta look at 'em right.\n\nNeedless to say, A:I is a game with tons of potential for frustration as you will be playing a couple of areas a few times before you figure out how to best tackle them. Wether or not you will enjoy it depends mostly on your admiration for the Alien-IP. It is definitely a good game and is quite a departure from the stuff I usually play - and seeing how I am quite happy that I actually did play (and finish) it, says a lot about its quality. It's a unique experience and does wonders with the license - reason enough for me to recommend it, even to all those people that normally would not touch a game like this.","March 21, 2015","true","21.4"," 285 of 309 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","285","309","7","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/214490/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2492 products in account","Edit: Updated with Crew Expendable and Last Survivor DLC thoughts. DLC at the very bottom.\n\nBarring something amazing coming within the next 2 months, I have no hesitation in naming Alien: Isolation as my game of the year right now. It's an incredible experience that I will remember for a long time to come and it very much deserves to be included in the "Alien" canon. Every single survivor horror game will be compared to this until its bested. While I have a lot of love for the great games in the Resident Evil franchise and some other survival horror classics, this game is a totally different experience than all of them.\n\nI want to preface this review by stating that before playing this game, you owe it to yourself and the creators of this wonderful game to watch the Ridley Scott directed 1979 classic, "Alien" that this game is inspired by and is essentially, a sequel to. I had seen the film multiple times, but watched it again 2 days before this game launched. I am glad that I did. There is a lot of fantastic detail that you will miss and may not even get if you don't have the film at least a little fresh in your mind. I can't understand why anyone would play this before watching it really. From minor things such as musical cues to much larger things that I won't mention. Watch the film, then play the game. You'll be glad you did and it will greatly enhance your experience.\n\nTo sum it up simply, Alien Isolation is in my view the greatest survival horror game of its ilk ever created. It's extremely challenging on low difficulties and it creates a feeling of tension that I have never experienced before in a game. Creative Assembly have created their magnum opus. You feel as Amanda Ripley feels. You feel the sense of dread and foreboding. That said, this is not a game that everyone will enjoy. Many people play games to have fun and don't take things too seriously. That's perfectly fine. The biggest standout of this game is how it takes the gamer to places they don't get to go too often in games. A very dark and scary place that tests your skill in every respect. It really is a "different kind" of fun.\n\nTechnologically, the game shines. The graphics are tip top with great use of particle effects and some of the best fire I've ever seen in a game. I have what I would consider to be a "mid-range" rig and I was able to Ultra everything and not once experienced any sort of dip in performance. Level design makes you feel that you're in this place that you have no idea how to get out of. Vents are terrifyingly claustrophobic at times. The sound is insane in respect to how much it adds to the game. "Thump, thump, thump". You will hear this. You will fear this. The attention to detail is borderline masochistic in how everything from a label to the Alien itself will have you shaking your head in awe. Even the music is composed and constructed in a way to help add to the tension.\n\nIf I have one tip for this game: SAVE IT EVERY TIME YOU SEE A SAVE POINT. Autosaves are only at the beginning of missions and missions tend to be long.\n\nHere's a TL:DR Pros/cons list and some basic stats.\n\nAt the time of this review, I have logged 15.1 hours at about 40% on normal difficulty and 60% on easy. I have played and completed only the main story. I have played none of the DLC or challenge maps at all....yet.\n\nPros\n\n+ This game is the "Alien" story's "Batman Begins". Great writing/storytelling and voice acting.\n+ Exceptionally challenging. Easy difficulty is not easy. The game does not hold your hand at all.\n+  The attention to detail at literally every single point in the game world is astonishing.  The art direction is Oscar-worthy.\n+ This game has the best sound in video game history. The sound of the Alien hunting you is a sound you won't forget.\n+ The score borrows aspects from the film and also has its own flavor. It works incredibly well. The musical cues that you recognize from the film fit perfectly.\n+ A very nice length to the story mode. 15 hours for a game like this is not something that you see often these days.\n+ Creates a feeling of tension and helplessness that I have never experienced playing a video game before.\n+ The Alien's AI is unpredictable and constantly changes. Forces you to vary how you approach a situation. If he gets you once, be sure to change your tactic.\n\nCons\n\n- As outstanding as it looks, facial animations rendered in-game are poor.\n- There are some mechanics that are more frustrating than fun.\n- Some cheap jump scares, mostly near the end of the game.\n- A few immersion killing enemy placements  that will cause immediate deaths.\n- Many false endings. You'll think you're done, but you're not.\n- Story mode does not have a lot of replayability. There are 3 skill levels.  Its absolutely not the kind of game I want to jump back in and play again immediately though.\n- The difficulty lets up a bit in the middle third of the game and while I was relieved a bit, I found the best parts to be when they were the most tension filled. Endgame (last 2-3 hours) are non-stop.\n- The map is horrible. Probably by design. It encourages you to find the path without the map.\n\nNeedless to say, I am blown away by this game. It also has added to my appreciation of the film and I am extremely excited to play the "Crew Expendable" DLC soon, which is probably going to feel like a whole new game. I will review that and append this review once I have completed it.\n\nRating: 10/10 - No hyperbole. This game is pitch perfect and exactly the type of game I was hoping it would be.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCREW EXPENDABLE & LAST SURVIVOR DLC\n\nBoth of these DLCs allow you to play two key scenes of the original film in a game form. As with Isolation, the attention to detail is tantamount to perfection. The digital re-creation of both the actors (+ they recorded new dialogue) as well as the Nostromo itself is astonishing and really the big star of the DLC. This is a bit unfortunate.\n\nI was initially excited upon the announcement that we'd get to play this as the original film is a long-time favorite. However, rather than provide the gamer with a chance to "change" something from the original film (aside from a character selection in Crew Expendable), the gameplay depth is a bit shallow.  Basically both DLCs allow you to play through two key scenes from the film. Crew Expendable allows you to make a minor change in choosing between Ripley, Dallas or Parker, (Last Survivor is only Ripley) but the end is always the same. The objectives are always the same. My feeling on this DLC is that if the 1979 film was a game, these two slices would serve as perfect demos to the gameplay. However, knowing the story and film so well, they didnt do much for me as they're basically just scenes from the film with Isolation gameplay mechanics. I was also disappointed that "Last Survivor" felt unfinished, as the final showdown with the Alien on board the escape shuttle was not included yet the dramatic intent would lead someone whose not seen the film to think the end provided was the real ending. No Jonesy either.\n\nKudos to the designers and programmers for the stellar work. Kudos to the actors too. However, if this DLC is your main reason for buying the game, I cant suggest it at all. Isolation should be the reason.\n\nTotal gametime with 3 playthroughs of the DLC on normal difficulty (2 different characters on Crew Expendable + 1 play of Last Survivor) totaled around an hour or so. Its short, but definitely worth a look if you enjoy the film and an interesting way to re-live a film but no surprises.\n\nLet me be clear as well, that my feelings on the DLCs gameplay depth have absolutely no bearing on my feelings towards Isolation.","October 10, 2014","true","16.1"," 288 of 316 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","288","316","3","11"

As a long time gamer, I can tell you that no other game has pulled the atmosphere of the original quite like this one.\n\nI've been playing on the hard setting and yes, doing so means a lot of deaths but for me, it's  almost a right of passage.  A homage to the movie responsible for my childhood nightmares.  You play as a vulnerable character, which I find refreshing and one with whom we can relate.  I mean sure, I'd love to imagine myself as an ***-kicking hero if faced with such a situation but truth be told, most of us would simply cower under a desk such as Amada Ripley and I have been doing the past 5 mins.\n\nThe game is reminiscent of titles such as Outlast and Amnesia but you are not completely defenceless and that's a welcome change.  Add to that a dash of classics such as System Shock 2, Bio Shock... and you'll get the idea.  I've read somewhere that this isn't a survival horror game but more of a survival simulator.  I can attest to how that statement rings true -the save system can be brutal and the game itself is not for the faint of heart.  As such, every inch of the station that you explore feels like a victory onto itself, not to mention finding the next save station.  This is survival horror/stealth at its finest.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic, kodos to Creative Assembly for making the alien's a.i. so unrelenting.  This is how H.R. Giger's creation should be embodied.  You really get the feeling of being hunted by the "perfect organism".\n\nPC otimization are top notch here, FOV slider and all\n\nAs for the DLCs; I have the Ripley edition (all dlc so far) and it's more fanservice than anything else.  Not a bad thing for guys such as myself who loved th first movie but better left for us diehard fans.  The meat is in the base game.\n\nSo "In space, no one can hear you scream" huh?

Know what to expect. The trailers for this game suggested to me that you would be stuck on a ship with the alien and have to play smart and stealthily and it'd be around 8 hours long. I do not like to spoil myself by reading reviews and previews so I didn't know that most of this game is spent on an enormous space-station and I took 25 hours to beat this game. It's not built like an indie survival-horror title like I thought it would be, but instead like a triple-A title, for better and for worse. I would have liked a more well-paced game with a satisfying intro, climax, and conclusion, and not the drawn-out marathon we got instead, but that said, this game can be enjoyed as long as you know that and adjust accordingly.\n\n2. Soak in the game's atmosphere. Read everything, look at everything, and loot everything you can. The sound and music work is astounding and adds to the tension and fear rather than takes away from it like in Resident Evil 4. In RE4, whenever an enemy or enemies spawned somewhere in the vicinity, the same music would play until it or they all died. Thus, when there was no music playing, you knew you were safe. However, in A:I, the same effect kind of happens, but the Alien can pop up at any time with no warning, and only then the music will slowly ramp up and get louder the closer it gets to you. The same philosophy from RE4 is kind of there but it is far more subtle and dynamic. Great job Creative Assembly.\n\n3. Take your time. One of the reasons why IGN and Gamespot found this game frustrating is because reviewers only have a limited time-window in which they can complete and review a game.\n\nYour goal while playing this game should not be to 'beat it' but to enjoy it. If the game is frustrating you, stop playing it, and come back to it later. You will try new ways to get past an area, and be more level-headed. 'Professional' reviewers don't necessarily have this luxury because they're on a time-crunch; give them some slack.\n\nIf you make 'beating' the game your goal, you will not enjoy it because it's very long for the type of game it is, and the game keeps pulling the carrot-on-a-stick further back each time you think you can bite it.\n\n4. Temper your expectations. Although this game looks very realistic and as believable as future space can be, it's still a videogame. The AI is still handled in a traditional way with set paths, with the twist of randomization thrown in. The Alien won't exactly behave like the Alien in the movie(s). It may throw you off and break you out of your immersive bubble when you see the Alien patrolling on its hind legs like a human, and run around desks when it should be jumping on top of the desk and coming straight for you. Just realize that is hard to program and give the developers some slack.\n\n5. Don't be too conservative when crafting. The game is fairly generous with crafting materials. Save before you go to a difficult area, try a different strategy, and if it doesn't work, reload your save and try something else. Be patient, and have fun coming up with new strategies.\n\nAs a summation, enjoy the game, soak it all in, take your time, and embrace the challenge. This game was designed to be challenging, even on Easy. Instead of getting frustrated, open your mind, think differently, and use the tools the developers have given you to achieve your goal.\n\nThank you for reading, and have a great day.","October 28, 2014","true","30.0"," 177 of 185 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","177","185","3","3"

Only really remembering the original Aliens movie well (the rest that came afterwards were crap really but entertaining in their own rights) but having watched all of them, they all to some degree had the common storyline thread that these Xeno's are extremely hard to kill creatures evolved to survive almost anything hence the need to nuke them from orbit etc or send in a stupidly arrogant cannon fodder strike team deliberately using them to lure the creatures onto another vessel for the company for profitable reasons.\nThis game is an updated version of Ellen Ripley's experience in the original movie lived through her daughter in every way quite literally. Also it's a straight PS4 and Xbone port there is 0% difference graphics wise in the PC version but here's to the hope that a hi-res texture pack is made available, I won't cry if it isn't it would be nice though. The tension in the gameplay design and atmosphere generated throughout the 18 levels was immense and has made more than a few players 'go emo' and or curl up in foetal position after having died repeatedly perhaps because they have forgotten just what the nature of the Xeno is.\nIf you remember the original movie this creature is near perfection in it's evolution from it's parasitic to adult form only being easily vulnerable in it's pod and parasite (face sucker) forms. The immediate priority once Ellen Ripley has this realisation is to never allow the situation for contact between her and the Xeno to occur and it's the same scenario for her daughter Amanda. I can't or don't think it fair to anyone thinking to pick this game up to go into game detail storyline wise so I'll try to provide some kind of useful insight to what to expect from this game.\nExtreme difficulty factor in surviving due to zero overpowered weapons available on the station.\nRelentless searches for raw materials to craft items to aid in survival only device crafting.\nYou can't run around like a total no stealth noob firing weapons and not draw attention to yourself.\nThe only opponents you can kill are feral human survivors and rogue security forces on the station that if are armed will shoot you almost on site (not all survivors have gone feral either) and cheap and nasty psychotic Weyland Yutani knock-offs even harder to kill than the feral humans called 'Working Joe's'\nNext-gen console only level graphics with 0% improvement through the in-game options. (I'm yet to test using NVidia control panel settings to tweak for any visual gains will try though and edit accordingly)\nA lot of calm collected thinking required in avoiding but also preparation to be hunted down and killed by the Xeno if you don't. You need plan 'B's' or it's restart from the last checkpoint time.I'm going to play through on easy setting next play through(s) lol to see if I can\nFind all 10 Nostromo logs.\nContact my team and escape Comms without being attacked by an android.\nComplete "The Quarantine" without being killed by the Alien.\nNavigate Reactor Maintenance without dying.\nComplete the game without killing any humans.\nComplete the game without dying.  All the 'without dying' achievements are do-able by hitting pause and restarting from the last checkpoint save. 'Complete the game without killing any humans' is easy as you can always draw attention cleverly to an area with armed people either letting them stupidly shoot at you taking cover of course or tossing a noise maker into their area for similar effect then waiting the required time for Xeno to show up and dispatch them for you always 'admiring it's purity' while it does so lol.\nTo round out, from a coding/port and hardware perspective I didn't have one crash during my 41hrs to complete this game. As mentioned it is a straight out PS4/XBone port with 0% visual gain on the PC version so far, so you could buy it on console if you had a next-gen one and trade/sell it when done. I also had zero lag or noticeable frame drops on my bucket PC which I can provide more detail if you are hesitant due to system considerations of your own.\nI haven't played any of the available DLC yet but definitely will do so when time permits and update the review accordingly. I can see myself purchasing the season pass for sure and can say if you are simply holding back on buying due to price vs perceived value then hold for Xmas sale.\nLate edit\nOculus Rift DK2 is now usable!

From the dark atmosphere,aesthetic of the ship, xenomorph enemy,  and the music. The game finally   pleasing the fans who questions to themselves "Will there ever be that one good Alien game?"  This is it.\n\nGame completed - First time hard 21 hours straight.\nDeath count -127 deaths total.\n\nAlien Isolation is a first-person horror survival game that put players into the shoes of Amanda Ripley, who is seeking out closure for her mother's ship disappearance. She has received tips that the black box recording to the Nostromo is aboard the Sevastopol station.  Only when arriving did she discovered that there are chaos and anarchy among the crew, Killer synthetics, and an Alien drone that sneaked aboard.\n\nThe main storyline to the game was really decent. Most of the lore can be found in the audio logs and terminals found throughout the game which tells what was happening on the ship  written exceptionally well.\nThe graphics and art absolutely capture references to the Alien's franchise. Sevastopol space station itself shows resemblance to the Nostromo in its exterior and interior design because the ships were built during the same time. There are terminals that give players the nostalgic feel of the Alien movie with some modern implementation of aesthetics.   The Xenomorph is magnificent to see itself from head to tail as it moves around knocking objects over.The effects in the game  on the ship  captures the immersive  atmosphere and drive players with the fogging, lightning and fire. The facial animations is  done well except for certain portions  which lacks work.\n\nThe sound and music in this game  surround sounds is fantastic. There will be   eerie sounds throughout the ship as the xenomorphs makes it the way all over the area  along with music that kicks in just at the right times, synthetics eeriely stalks the hallways talking to themselves and humans talking among each other. The sounds will make players turn a head to look all around while music comes in at times and put players at the edge of their feet giving the notion that something bad is about to happen. The voice acting in the game itself though is done well.\nThe controls are really done well on the keyboard with the layout which  are also bindable. Players are able to lean from the sides, back , and above objects to observe the where about of enemies. Running is a dangerous feature that should be used mindfully because enemies hears your steps.\n\nThe game play itself is more stealth playwhere unlike its previous titles, the alien in this game  cannot be killed by the weapons available. It is played cat and mouse style to escape and accomplish objectives. Most of the traveling to areas of the ship is done via transits hub in the game. Some of the maps in the game are corridor areas but there are decently sized open spaces also with multiple paths and vents to crawl around.\n\nthe weapons Players will be armed with are a wrench to open doors and melee, stun baton, revolver, shotgun, Flamethrower that can scare away the aliens, and a bolt gun which is the most powerful gun to kill synthetics and  humans. Along with weapons, players are also able to  craft  by collecting  certain materials. Players can craft objects such as flares, noisemaker, smoke bombs. Flash bangs, e.m.p mine, Molotov, pipe bombs, and medkits. Which can be found around the ship and on enemies. Each items serve a valuable purpose of surviving against foes, and each should be used sparingly. Choosing to use any of these crafted items on enemies  must be made with care because using them can be dangerous at times since they can hurt the player or call enemies.\n\nThere are also other items such as The modified motion tracker which is important to detect locations of xenomorphs and other dangers. When looking at the tracker player loses focus around them.This feature was brilliant and adds an immersion in awareness. There are also the  upgradable gases torches to unseal certain panels on doors, and an access tuner to hack into computers. The hacking aspect is actually quite entertaining  with its puzzles while the torches are motion qte and the coded door inputs are done with the keyboard. Everything that is done in this game from reloading bullets, saving, or even crafting will put players in danger if done in the open. There is never a moment of truly feeling safe, keeping an eye out on what is going on is important and adds a great depth of immersion. Saving is done with a machine in the game with only 2 saveslots where players can load a recent or previous save on death and the station takes time to recharge so save carefully.\n\nThe enemies in the game are crazed synthetics working joe, humans who have lost trust among each other,and Xenomorph alien. Enemy Ai in the game is great and unpredictable at times but not every time.Sometimes they have a set paths and vents  but other times they show up in random corners and locations.How they react and what they learn from player's behavior are quite astonishing, especially on hard difficulty. They will seek players out, pull them up vents, ambush around corners, pull you out of tables, hear sounds, or even investigate certain areas repeatedly. One example is using the noisemaker repeatedly and watching in fear as the alien realizes the trick before and dashes down the hallway in rage seeking out the player or gunshots will make them come out.  When hiding in lockers, etc. one must lean back and hold breathe in order to survive an encounter. Hiding in the same places too many times will prompt check from the enemy. There is also hiding under tables crouching around objects to obscure  line of sight on enemies is some of the best ways to stealth. There are also override door controls to lock doors and  panels in the game that players can divert power from certain systems to thwart enemies such as turning on speakers, lightning and alarms to get away.\n\nAlong with the Main storyline game play, there are dlcs that replay certain events in Ellen Ripleys Alien encounters and a 	 survivor mode. No multiplayer except score rank survivor.\nIn short as an Alien fan I've found this game amazingly well done and truly does some justice for the franchise unlike what I've played and rage on before cough colonial marines.  Amanda Characteristic, however, didn't really fully immerse me to being scared because of how brave she was at times throughout the game, I found myself adrenaline pumped  and questioning how aliens have consistently found me. Until I discovered that they were learning my awesome habits. I was being pulled from , under tables, closets, and found around certain corners making me shout in anger at times WTF! This game was a bit difficult, and I made it to the end with a sliver of life left and barely anything in my inventory.  Play this game on hard to truly see the beauty of the game. This game will last you 17 hours + at least if you explore and stealth your way.\n\nPros\n- The graphics, artwork, and immersive atmosphere\n- Music and eerie sounds to the jump scares to  terrify players.\n- Enemy seeks out players, learns from what they do, Ai is decently done\n- Great research and work on the Alien franchise from the devs\n- The writings in the terminals and audio logs are really well done.\n- An Alien game that does the franchise some justice\nCons\n- Backtracking on the same area of the map can be a bit tedious at times.\n-Bad animations on some of the monitor work\n- No mutliplayer except scoreboard survivor mode, replay value drops after a few run through, lack of end content\n- Game is not intended to be for the fustrated, Pick easy mode if you are having a hard time.\n\nVideo Review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FESmpJLBmME&list=PL6GtmLrh3QgEyyl6_Jn08_pqwQFi9E3Vp\nYt/Twitch - Kenuty\nCurators follow - Stream or look at my profile and support!","October 8, 2014","true","25.2"," 355 of 418 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","355","418","5","16"

Well, actually stuck in a space station with humans (how boring), synthetic androids (bloody hard to kill) and your one and unique little black pet with his/her double extendable set of teeth and a very sharp and pointy tail.\n\nThis game is seriously creepy from the start and really true to the Alien movie franchise, especially the first one. I personally like the 1980 monitors on the space station.\n\nYou play Amanda Ripley and your quest is to find out what happened to your mother. You will end up on a station call Sevastopol, where your trouble will begin.\n\nEssentially, this is more a stealth type of game rather than action (shooting) and make sure you know where you can hide. You will eventually find a gun but the ammunitions do not come in abundance, so really look after them. During your journey, you will be able to collect items like scraps, ethanol, sensors etc. With it you will be able to craft well needed objects like Molotov, Pipe bomb, Noise maker, Medipack and others.\n\nGreat graphics, splendid audio which empower the fabulous and scary atmosphere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/recommended/214490/","Duskspark","Duskspark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/","484 products in account","Alien: Isolation\nPersonal rating: definately worth it if you're an Alien-fan.\nTraditional rating: 8/10\n\nThe Pros:\n· The most intelligent Alien AI to date. With there being only one Alien (and some hostile humans and Working Joe androids), you'll face this Xenomorph quite a lot durning your 14 hour campaign. The Alien will hunt for you relying on smell, sound and sight, and it'll learn from its previous encounters with you.\n· A fantastic combination of stealth and survival-horror. Hearing the Alien hiss as its tail nearly reaches for you under the table is incredibly terrifying, and using your tools and crafted items to lure it away is equally satisfying. Every encounter with the Alien, humans or Working Joes requires you to rely on different approaches and manage to keep the lengthy story varied and interresting.\n· Lots of single player content to keep fans entertained and immersed. Apart from the long campaign, there are a couple of other game modes that will have you completing smaller missions or just surviving for as long as possible against the Alien. With the addition of fan-favorite playable characters, there's a lot to see and do in Alien: Isolation before you've actually seen and done it all.\n\nThe Cons:\n· It's definately not for everyone. The Alien can't be killed and the more action-packed sequences are few and far between. Most of the time you'll be hiding from the Alien, going from point A to point B, collecting what needs to be collected and trying to keep the Alien at bay by scaring it off with fire. I found out for myself that the tense moments really last and linger, and not getting a breather every once in a while can be a downside for some.\n\nThe Visuals & Audio:\n· In terms of visuals and sound, Alien: Isolation is top notch. Seeing flames lick the walls and puffs of steam escaping through pipes is just as immersive as hearing the Alien's heavy feet storming towards your position as it hisses in anger. This is truly next-gen.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n­· Alien: Isolation is definately worth it if you're an Alien-fan. People that aren't into stealth or survival-horror might not find as much of a thrill ride as us Alien-fans do though, so I'd recommend those people to wait for a small sale, but come on... who doesn't get terrified by aliens and space?!","October 8, 2014","true","11.7"," 227 of 262 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","227","262","2","14"

I was sitting next to the transit gate, all crouched up, just like the pre-release videos and inteviews taught me to do, waiting in a big dark room for my transit to arrive.\n\nI knew that there's no way the Alien will suddenly drop down and attack me there. "It's too soon", I told myeself, but then the music kicks in, the transit takes its sweet time and Ripley starts whispering "Come on", so I started feeling doubt; Maybe the Alien will come anyway? Maybe I'm not as safe as I thought? The transit did eventually come, the Alien didn't appear and I moved on to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants in a whole new section of the game.\n\nThis is where Alien Isolation truly shines: it makes you feel like you're being hunted even when you aren't.\n\nThis game was all that was promised - and more. It is the most fun (in quite the terrifying sense) I had with an Alien related game since Rebellion's AvP from back in 1999, and the best survival horror experience since System Shock 2 (we'll get back to that game later). This game is so good in so many ways it made me forgive it for not having any type of multiplayer.\n\nSo what makes this game earn this much praise out of me right off the bat?\n\nLet's start with the visuals: The game is gorgeous. I'm not a big graphics guy and usually the aesthetic aspect of games takes a back seat for me, but the effort that was put into the environments is part of what makes this game amazing. It plays very well with light and darkness and makes great use of the low tech Sci-Fi feel of the original Alien from 1979.\nAdd to that the amazing sound effects of the game, and you get a sense of total immersion: The station looks very believable with trash, magazinges and games laying around the place, completely selling the notion that people lived here not too long ago. The random pipes that can be frequently found around the station resemble the Alien's dome head in dark areas, while the ventilation shaft and air leak sounds resembe its hisses, adding even more to the scare factor.\n\nThe design of the Working Joes is also good and fits into a horror game perfectly. Them being an inferior synthetic design by a failing corporation sells their looks quite well.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself: It seems as though the developers of Creative Assemby took everything that was great in System Shock 2 and implemented it in the Alien universe. You arrive  on a station where something has gone horribly wrong and are now trying to figure out what is going on. You learn about the characters and the events that took place on the Sevastopol through notes and Audio Logs, which add a lot of depth to the storyline. Creative Assemby invested a lot of effort in creating the Seegson corporation and making it fit as a part of the Alien universe alongside Weyland-Yutani, and it shows. To the point where by the end of the game you can't even remember what the Alien universe was like without Seegson.\n\nThe progression of the game is quite linear, but the game does give you many options for exploration (not an easy thing to do with a homicidal Alien on your tail). It even features backtracking elements that were prominent in in System Shock 2, making you feel like you're truly running around on a space station and not just moving from one scene to the next.\n\nYou have three main enemies to watch out for during the game: Humans, Working Joes and the Alien itself. There's a fourth enemy as well that reveals itself to you in the late game, which I will not discuss due to spoilers. Humans and Working Joes are quite dumb and are usually easy to deal with. Some of them will attack you, while others will leave you be. It will be up to you to discover their intentions, which adds to the sense of fear during the game.\n\nThe Alien, being the main star of the game, is quite fearsome. Once it finally reveals itself to you, it does not disappoint. It is big, fast, clever and can spot you from a good distance if you cross its line of sight. If the Alien sees (and sometimes hears) you - you're dead. No way to outrun it. While being extra big and extra loud in this game compared to its past incarnations, do not understimate the Alien's ability to sneak up on you. It has killed me from behind, dragged me into vents and even flat out dropped down right on my face more times than I could count. This makes the Alien a menace even when you finally get a Flamethrower.\n\nThe hacking ability - another element that seems as if it was taken right out of System Shock 2 - is a rather simple test of mental and reactionary challenges. The trick is that you're never safe while performing them. You'll be surprised how hard (and dangerous) it becomes to complete something as simple as a shape matching challenge while hearing the Alien's footsteps thumping in the background.\n\nThe save system of the game is quite nice as well. You can only save the game in special checkpoints that look like payphones. Those checkpoints take time to save and also warn you when hostiles are nearby. The game will have you praying to reach an area with one of those payphones around and to be able to save safely. Yes, you can die while saving. Yes, the Alien managed to get me this way as well.\n\nEvery other action you take - opening doors; cutting through barriers; accessing terminals; activating generators - are all designed to slow you down and make you feel vulnerable. Instead of just interacting with a door by pressing E, for example, you'll be required to hit a series of key combinations. Different doors and levers require different key combinations.\nIn short, the gameplay goes through a lot of trouble to convey that every action you take, even as trivial as opening a door, comes with a cost.\n\nAs good as this game is, it does have a few issues that, while minor, can't be ignored:\n\nThe first is the Human/Working Joe AI. While their AI is not horrible, the huge difference between their AI and the Alien's impressive AI breaks immersion at times.\n\nThe second is the Working Joes during the late game. Missions 11-13 in particular. The Working Joes are scary and interesting in the early game, when you're low on weapons and supplies, but in the late game they become nothing more than a hassle. During missions 11-13 the Alien threat is temporarily removed and the game lets you know it, so the missions turn into Joe hunting missions where you can just go to town on them with the strongest guns in your arsenal.\n\nThe third is the lip sync in this game. While the voice acting is, at the most part, impressive, it doesn't seem to sync very well with the lip movements of the characters.\n\nThe fourth is the controls option in the menu. For some reason, it shows gamepad keys to me while I use keyboard/mouse.\n\nOverall though, this game is a must in any Alien fan's game library. If you're looking for a game that brings back honor (and horror) to the Alien franchise; if you're looking for a survival horror experience that's based more on atmosphere, immersion and a sense of helplessnes than on jump-scares and scripted events; if the idea of playing a game of cat and mouse with an unkillable foe equipped with an impressive AI speaks to you - you will love Alien: Isolation.","October 30, 2014","true","126.2"," 113 of 121 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","113","121","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/214490/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I’m not sure I’ve ever played a game that’s taken me on the sort of rollercoaster of conflicting opinions as Alien: Isolation did.\n\nIts a collection of parts that rarely if ever align in quality, full of as many impressive moments as staggeringly poor design decisions that at times made me question if I should even bother continuing. Taken as a whole I couldn’t call it much more than a mess, but it’s a mess just redeeming enough to be worth struggling through for the parts that shine. When Isolation gets on a roll the experience developer Creative Assembly wanted to create shows through and the result is something incredible. The problem is whether it’s worth sticking around to see them.\n\nThe introduction to the space station “Sevestopol” acts as the placement of the carrot on the stick in front of you, starting with a literal bang as it introduces you to what will become the glue that holds the fragile experience together: the astounding atmosphere and world building. Sevestopol is such a consistently successful and fully realized environment that I could possibly make a case for playing the game based on it alone. The signs of a city gone to hell, systems in disarray, echoes of things you’d probably prefer not to see, eerily uplifting messages broadcasting over the loudspeakers; the sense of place is almost unequaled and is enough to propel you through the world before you’re even given a reason to want or need to. It’s as terrifyingly unknown as it is compelling for the very same reason, almost as if the station (which acts as essentially a small city) is whispering in your ear about what could be around the next corner, and the curiosity is too much to resist.\n\nAnd that’s definitely a good thing, as when Isolation is trying to create an incentive to keep moving with its narrative things get a little...messy. Set 15 years after Alien (and though I would assume it’s a given, you should absolutely watch at least Alien and Aliens before you play Isolation) Ripley’s daughter, Amanda, is contacted with a message containing the possible whereabouts of her believed dead mother, which then leads to Sevestopol, which leads to everyone’s worlds falling apart around them as they realize what they’re up against.\n\nIsolation’s biggest narrative disability is a disinterest or fear of ever branching out past what we already know about Alien to create its own identity. Amanda exists as a blank slate to send out into situations that often make far less sense than anybody seems to want to admit. She’s a catalyst to delivering you to areas designed for the sole purpose of playing to nostalgia and fanservice but having very little substance tying them together. As cool as it is to see so many iconic moments from a franchise I love faithfully recreated in interactive form, there came a point rather early on where the novelty wore off and I was ready to see what Isolation could do on its own.\n\nWhatever it might have been doesn’t show up, moving on like an excited child wanting to show you their favorite toys but having little more to say about them than “remember this? Yeah, I loved it too!”. Perhaps this would be alright in a shorter game, but Isolation drags on for so unbelievably long and retreads the same notes so many times that I became numb to its enthusiasm and just wanted to be out of a world that had begun to stress me out. There are at least three major scenes during the game where it could have ended and provided just as much (or little, in this case) closure as the actual ending, and part of me thinks it would have been better off for it even if it meant cutting some of the more interesting sections out.\n\nIt’s a little hard to say that and mean it fully though, as without a doubt the biggest cause for the extended playtime was how much of it I spent dying and repeating the same areas. For as much a horror game as it looks like from the outside, Isolation is far easier to relate to very traditional stealth games. You are (up until a point) completely helpless and forced to utilize tables and lockers to hide from enemies that can often kill you the second you’re spotted.\n\nIsolation’s stealth mechanics are intentionally intended to be very simple  and cause you to feel vulnerable, and in that they work exceptionally well. The game excels at creating tension and keeping it for as long as it can, causing me to hold my breath as often as my character as I prayed an enemy would walk past. As I said at the start, when Isolation works it’s absolutely brilliant and had me quickly forgetting about all the problems I have with it until they come back in screaming and firmly laying claim to something I was almost forcing myself to enjoy much of the time.\n\nThese problems are manifested as Isolation’s firm conviction to punish the player as often and with as much severity as it can possibly muster without completely crashing the game. Its design is often trial and error in nature, but complicated by the unpredictable enemy AI. The alien is your biggest threat, and the most persistent one, and by its very design it’s intended to be able to kill you very fast and be extremely hard to avoid. Vents and air ducts cover the entire ship and within them the alien has the ability to appear almost anywhere at anytime, save a handful of immersion breaking scripted sequences. One the one hand the almost random movements of the alien keep you on your toes and conscious of hiding spots, but on the other it makes death almost always feel cheap and unavoidable.\n\nWith how terrible Isolation is at explaining its mechanics, your objectives, how to get to them, or well, pretty much anything related to not being devoured by a Xenomorph, to make the act of learning these for yourself so precarious and full of repetition is a giant impairment on the experience. Compiling and then recompiling the issue again is possibly the most egregious save system of any game I’ve played in the last few years. No autosave, no checkpoints, just you and manual save stations placed sometimes 30-45 minutes apart to which you will be moved back to at every one of your many, many deaths. I doubt I could think of a game that so little respects the player’s time as it tests their patience, and was almost enough for me to quit the game and never look back.\n\nAnd it hurts more than you know to write that, largely because Isolation comes so close to getting it right and falls so far when it fails. The parts that function as intended are commendable and for me, made it worth putting myself through copious amount of duress to see them, but I’m not sure if I could make that call for anyone else. Isolation is an Alien game made by Alien fans for Alien fans, and looking back on it I guess that was enough for me. It has the makings of the game the franchise deserves and shows us why that would be so amazing, if only we can find a way to blow the troublesome bits out the airlock.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","November 28, 2014","true","18.7"," 182 of 233 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","182","233","4","32"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatorium/recommended/214490/","Predatorium","Lake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Predatorium/","76 products in account","This game will stick on your mind after you've completed it. I haven't played such a nightmarish experience in a long time. And that's a good thing. When you think the nightmare is over you are thrown into another one. It took me 22 hours to get through the campaign on hard. The difficulty is perfectly balanced. As long as you take your time and proceed carefully you should be fine most of the time.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of you sneaking, staying quiet, hacking, crafting items to distract enemies or impair them. The further you proceed on your different missions you will find upgrades for your tools that will allow you to access areas you earlier couldn't. You will also get your hands on upgrades for your make shift weapons. Lethal weapons will eventually become part of your inventory but it's recommended to avoid using them but the further you get in the game the more lethal situations will become and they will come in handy. You can backtrack if you want to, or explore areas that are not part of the current mission. If you do you might find secret audio logs, items and easter eggs. So the game never feels very linear but instead quite free which I haven't seen since early days of Resident Evil. Of course there's always imminent danger that waits for you to make a mistake. It's even more similar in the way that you have to save your game at save stations, but don't worry, you don't need an ink ribbon. However, the game doesn't pause when you save and it takes a while for the station to load up. Nor does the game pause when you bring up your inventory and crafting system, which is reminiscent of Dead Space.\n\nThe story is good and quite straight forward, and it does contain twists and turns that did make me jump with excitement and surprise. However I wish that the conclusion would have been more satisfying. The voice acting is solid but the lipsyncing is quite poor. Especially when it's in-game and not a cut-scene.\n\nThe game itself is very well built. At no time did I experience any performance loss, crashes or game glitches that interfered with the gameplay. During my long playthrough I only noticed one or two oddity not even worth mentioning. I played the game on ultra settings and the visuals are very impressive when it comes to lights and shadows. There so many details in the environment in this game that it's amazing. At a closer inspection though, some low-res textures can be found but overall an incredible looking game.\nThe sound design is perfect, it re-creates and expand upon all the sounds and music from the movie Alien that it makes you feel like you really are in that universe.\nThe physics are great with your body reacting to everything around you in the environment, you might for example accidentally kick something on the floor and cause a loud noise or tip over furniture etc.\n\nThe option menu is well fleshed out with many different visual settings, including FOV.\n\nThe different mechanics like crafting, hacking, using tools and weapons is very intuitive. For example when entering a passcode you use your numpad, or when re-loading a weapon you must hold R to reload a full magazine, if you just press R once it will only load one bullet for example. Computer interfaces requires you to use your keyboard to navigate, like if there are no mouses which add to the push button feel of the 70s.\n\nI was worried that the alien's "AI" would fail and break the game, but I'm glad to have been proven wrong. Not at any time did I see the alien glitch out or do something stupid. It really is a ruthless killer that requires your respect. The same goes for the humans and the androids. The humans work together as teams and if they are hostile you better avoid them or distract them to get to where you need to go. The androids are lethal if they catch you, they can't run but they do walk steadily towards you like a terminator.\n\nConclusion: While it does borrow a lot from other games in the terms of gameplay mechanics, this survival horror game combines old school gameplay with an extremely impressive, dynamic enemy, incredible visual and sound design and a thrilling story in full blown Alien spirit. It's a truly unique experience. If you are a fan, don't miss out on Amanda Ripley's struggle for survival and quest to find the truth..","October 9, 2014","true","97.4"," 91 of 103 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","91","103","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxOfS2D/recommended/214490/","MaxOfS2D","MaxOfS2D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxOfS2D/","370 products in account","This is the first Alien game that does everything (or almost everything) right, that gives justice to the universe seen in the original 1979 movie. It's a must-play.\n\nYou're the daughter of Ellen Ripley, fifteen years after the event of the first movie. The very basic summary of the premise is that you're trying to get assigned to jobs close to where your mother was last seen; you're looking for traces of her. The story isn't the likes of modern Hollywood movies and that's a good thing; something overly dramatic or with a big scale would have not worked at all.\n\nThe first thing you're going to notice here is the technical presentation. It's nearly flawless. It's the first movie come to life, with its imperfect retro-futuristic technology that runs on magnetic tapes and cartridges. The space station is GORGEOUS. You'll find yourself jaw agape when looking out of a window, towards the stars, the gas giant, the sun, the rest of the station. It's amazing. And it runs really well, too; I could max out the settings at 2560x1440 on a GeForce 670 and achieve nearly-constant 60fps (or more, as I am using a GSync monitor). Its only big problem is the lack of effective anti-aliasing; temporal SMAA 2x helps, but it's not doing miracles.\n\nAnd while we're at it: the audio direction of this game should win many awards, and then we should invent new audio awards just so it can win them. It's really good. Get a headset.\n\nEventually you first come face-to-face with the Alien. And this is when the paranoïa settles in. It's wholly unpredictable; you'll often hear the creature around you, in the ceilings, in the walls. There are other ennemies around the station (creepy androids that have gone haywire and forgot about their "do no harm to human life" directive, and other humans), and you will have to work around them... and you will constantly be faced with the choice of whether to deal with them directly, at the risk of causing enough noise to attract the Alien.\n\nOne of the main tools of the game is the motion tracker. It will allow you to get a general idea of other presences around you (most notably the Alien). However, something the game doesn't explicitly tell you is that it draws attention to you, with its faint noises and beeps being enough to reveal you in a few cases. You won't want to use it if you're hiding in a locker and the Alien is looking for you in the room.\n\nYou can craft a variety of devices and tools to help you deal with opponents (noisemakers, pipe bombs, molotovs, EMP mines...) by finding blueprints and loot which are usually not too far off the main road. There are weapons in this game; you have a melee attack, you'll find two guns and, eventually, a flamethrower, which is a get-out-of-jail-free card against the Alien. Ammo is scarce for everything, and Androids are hard to deal with (they generally require half of your total ammo, and can't be melee'd unless stunned).\n\nYou have room for emergent gameplay tactics, such as drawing the attention of the Alien to other hostile humans instead of you, and slide past the whole bunch unnoticed. It's pretty fun to try and come up with solutions (the classic one being "throw a distraction the opposite way you're trying to go to"), but there are a few factors to stealth that Alien: Isolation does differently to other games of the genre. You can't just expect to hide in a dark corner and survive; you have to keep moving at the right times, out of the lines of sight of ennemies, or when they're busy with something else. This is of utmost importance with the Alien, as its senses are heightened, and it will hear you very easily.\n\nSo yeah, the game is scary. And there are very few "automatic" checkpoints, so you'll find yourself burning with desire to find a save point. This is what primarily creates tension in the game; you don't want to have to redo that scary part again. It's a bit of an "artificial" way to do it, but it works! However, I dislike how it paces the game in a way where your next goal, story-wise, is overshadowed by "oh god i have to find the next save point please please please please where is it".\n\nI should talk about a few other things that the game, in my opinion, fails to do right.\n\nFirst, the alien is actually not *that* unpredictable; it's scripted to appear in a handful of moments. Most of which are right before save points. So you'll be prepared to throw a molotov at its face on your next attempt. There are also a few other moments where it *feels* like the Alien is scripted to show up on your motion tracker, lurking around you, but not actually coming out to hunt you until the point where you have to backtrack through an area to go somewhere else and it's inconvenient for you. Overall, its presence does not feel really systemized, though.\n\nSecond, there are some puzzles where the solution is really oddly placed or designed. The prime example I have in mind is a moment where you have to escape from a fire, on a time limit (draining health). The center of the room is on fire, the back of the room isn't, and there are doors there. Your first instinct is to go back there and look for the exit, but it took me a good three minutes (and 2 medkits) before I realized the ladder to escape was actually right above the fire at the center. The game has a few other moments like that in which what you're supposed to do is weirdly placed in relation to what you just did beforehand.\n\nThird, on a technical point, there are a few bugs, all of which have to do with other NPCs and cutscenes. I've had three cases where an in-gameplay cutscene was supposed to play with NPCs, but they just stood there motionless, and even a save reload would not fix it. These bugs, however, didn't impede my progress in any way.\n\nThe game is far longer than you will come to expect; a few times I was thinking "okay, this is the end", but it kept going. Not in a hamstrung, forced way (except for one case where you're like "oh COME ON"). Total playtime was ~16h30.\n\nOverall, this is a game that understands the 1979 movie, its universe, its aesthetics, why it was good, and which transposes its qualities in a game in a nearly flawless way. It attempts to tune down the "video gameisms" and doesn't always succeed, but the attempt alone is enough to set it way apart your run-of-the-mile AAA title. I'm wholeheartedly recommending it.","October 12, 2014","true","19.9"," 84 of 93 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","84","93","0","4"

The audio experience is truly outstanding and some of the best I've head in any game for some time, with a cleverly adapted OST and plenty of signature film sound-bites (that all made me smile) and background depth that alone creates an environment that is aurally terrifying.\n\nOccasionally a mood change in the audio ambience and soundtrack can be heard when moving from room to room or crouching in an odd corner, as the sound does not always crossfade smoothly, but instead abruptly changes like a bad edit in a film and will happen again the moment you return to the previous room. It's minor, but with so much care and quality to the audio, it is obvious. However, I still can not get enough of the audio and honestly wished more games crafted audio with this much detail and depth \d[]^__^]b/\n\n○ Visual - The spacecraft's interior looks and feels (visual textures) are as believable as it can be with Dynamic Lighting and truly life-like environmental effects. The physics of loose objects 'overreact' a little walked into and random saw a couple smaller objects hovering mid-air and only fell to the ground when walked into, but did not otherwise affect the game in anyway. If there's one thing I'd change about this brilliant game though, it's the NPC's movements. They all (standard game and even the 'DLC: Crew Expendable') move noticeably false and all give a characterless feeling, breaking the games depth and realism. If wasn't for the excellent voice-over acting, I wouldn't blame anyone for wanting to skip through the cut-scenes, but NPC in-game interaction obviously can't be skipped, which then (in-game) suffers from the occasional off-sync dialogue too. There is an obvious lack not just good, but working Anti Alias filters and is noticeable at 1080p and above. Most solid objects and backdrops are fine, but anything that is not fixed suffers from bad (games console toy-like) hard edge flickering and breaks the fear factor a little, as it's the type of game where you react to every micro movement on-screen, but if the edge of a box in the distance continuously makes you freeze in a cold sweat and moments later you see that it's just bad Anti Alias, you begin to play a little carefree, typically blaming the games actual background mechanics (built for game console toys). Currently, no matter what Anti Alias mode you use, it's not visually that noticeable. Hopefully an official update (or SweetFX if you prefer) will soon allow for a more aggressive Anti Alias filter, because for this sort of game really needs it. For the rest, all the usual visual settings are available to tweak where required and even on my old set-up it never dropped below 75fps with all settings maximised playing at a standard 1080p and at 1600p plays smoothly above 60fps too without a glitch. As my set-up is rather old though, it struggled to stay above 50fps in 2160p, which is not acceptable and I almost feel sorry for games console toy gamers ...almost {}¬__¬}\n\n○ FOV - The default is 47% which is more suitable for VR HMD's (if it ever officially happens), but does and allow up to 75% (and unofficially higher too), but setting it this high does actually feel too open and visually incorrect, so for once the default works best here or around 47-55%.\n\n○ Passive Stereo 3D - Works fine and looks pretty good once tweaked to your preference (Alt F5/F6) even though it's not officially available through Nvidia's 3D Experience configuration panel (yet), but can still be set manually like most games on Windows 8/8.1, especially via an LG (driver unlocked) TV's and practically any decent Passive Stereo 3D projector, which I highly recommend too ()3__D)\n\n○ Key Binding - Fully customisable and accepts multi-buttoned trackball/mouse controllers, Wii Nun-chucks and Logitech's G13 controller too. However, only 'one key' can be bound to each function, so no multi-HiD's options. The only option I'd request to be included for 'Key Binding' is to be able to turn off on-screen prompts in-game, because once you mastered the layout (which is easy enough and thankfully changeable too) you can retain the brilliant minimalist HUD and it's pure in the moment feel with minimal distractions.\n\n○ VR HMD - Oculus Rift DK2 'unofficially' works and is even more scream-out-loud terrifying \()3__D)/\n\nI've questioned Creative Assembly or Sega numerous times on their 'official' Oculus Rift support for home usage at various London gaming shows and publicly on Google+ but nothing, however, do the following to unofficially enable Rift DK2 functionality:\n\nIn ENGINE_SETTINGS.XML change to:\n<Setting name=”Stereo Mode”>\n<Quality name=”Rift” precedence=”4″/>\n</Setting>\n(<Setting name=”Stereo Mode”>\n<Quality name=”Rift” precedence=”4″/>\n</Setting>)\nIn BENCHMARK_TEMPLATE.TXT change to\nStereo Mode=Rift'\nSet the Oculus Rift DK2 to Extended mode and Pause Service. In-game re-calibrate orientation using Left and Right Tab  keys \[]3__D]/\n▂▁\n\n○ Update - 6th Oct - No sign of Jonesy's siblings ...yet?! =^. .^=\n○ Update - 7th Oct - Included further details on the Anti Alias issues {}◘__◘}\n○ Update - 8th Oct - Oculus Rift DK2 unofficially works ...start your screaming \[]3__D]/\n○ Update - 9th Oct - Included a brief intro []^__^]\n▂▁\n\n○ 2/3 - An outstanding game crafted with such detail and passion for both audio and visual, with an obvious love and respect of the Alien/s film franchise (mainly the brilliant Creative Assembly correcting some of Sega's past terrible gaming products on the franchise) creating an equal extension to the original Alien (1979) film, mirroring every memorable interior, exterior and character design (DLC: Crew Expendable), yet brilliantly a unique, new, heart thumping and interactive gaming experience all within the Alien world like never ever seen before. Believe it or not, we finally have a game that is equal to the film it's based upon and has survival sci-fi horror written in smeared blood all of it.\n\nI'm still on edge of giving it (my highest) '3/3', as the game itself is near perfection, unfortunately 'only' near though, mainly because of piffling technical issues, such as; a minor camera sync-glitch when tilting (Ctrl Key), slightly awkward controls (until remapped yourself), minor random abrupt audio changes, rigid NPC movements, NPC Android Ai's are actually better than the NPC human Ai's, off-sync dialogue in-game (with vertical synchronization enabled), slightly over compressed cut-scenes (noticeable block noise, colour noise and pre-rendered at a low resolution), no 'official' Oculus Rift (DK2) support and though the cut-scene contents are engaging enough, they look 'obviously' more suited to match in-game low visual quality for games console toys ...why 'they' still do this I will never understand?!

It also happens to be the best game of 2014 thus far (that is until 'Duck Dynasty' snatches that victory away). "But why should I believe you Spirit?" That's a good ♥♥♥♥ing point. Don't believe me. Play it yourself. I urge you. If you buy ONE game this year, make it this one.\n\nSo what's the setting? It's been 15 years since Ellen Ripley was elected Biggest ♥♥♥♥♥ of the Universe and, in true Master Chief style, has chosen to wait in deep space until humanity and James Cameron needs her again. But she's left behind a daughter, Amanda. And Amanda is a lot like her mother - intelligent, tenacious, scrappy, and a bit of a xenophobe. Her mother's fate has weighed heavily on her... until now. The interstellar black box of the Nostromo has reappeared and Weyand-Yutani has graciously offered her a spot on the Torren's manifest to find out what happened once and for all.\n\nAmanda and the motley crew arrives at the Sevastopol - a virtually defunct space station - where the audio log is waiting to be retrieved. Something else is waiting in the dark and cramped bowels of the Sevastopol, however. She stalks her prey quietly, relentlessly. She is utterly remorseless. She's as black as the space she occupies, serpentine and perfect in her design. She serves one god, a god we all answer to at one point or another - and she serves it well. Yes, she heard you knock over that can. And yes, she saw that closet door slam shut. And yes, she's staring through the slits, clicking and hissing. Feel free to squint your eyes tightly shut. The last thing you'll hear is that iconic, shrill scream.\n\nThe name of the game is atmospheric survival horror. There's the brief tutorial mission that explains stealth mechanics, crafting, and if-you-must combat. Then you'll explore the eerie, spacey haunted house. You'll find retro computers with logs, emails, and audio clips. You'll find graffiti, corpses, and malfunctioning androids. And eventually you'll find a few survivors - though they're survivors for a reason. It's generally wise to avoid these gun happy bands and keep moving... where there are warm, sweating bodies cursing in futility, there's something far worse observing from the shadows.\n\nThis title is kind of like Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Dead Space got stapled together and jettisoned into the void. As always your companions will hunker down somewhere and send you out into the labyrinth... to access medical supplies, sandwiches, and the like. You'll grumble and curse quietly to yourself, ducking in and out of offices, crawling under gurneys and desks, knowing that at any point your Minotaur might show up. Sometimes the alien makes a lot of fanfare - twirling out of a vent like an upside down stripper one week from retirement. Other times she'll just drool in said vent, waiting for you to foolishly walk under it - like... like a stripper who's two weeks from retirement.\n\nYou'll gather scrap and items to craft noise makers, Molotovs, and medkits to help you on your journey - none of which will provide much comfort. Because that creature can't be stopped. Sure, you can dissuade her for a minute. But she'll be back. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥. And when you're crouched under a gurney in medical and that tail slaps wetly on the floor in front of you you'd better put your tracker away... because she WILL see the light and hear the beeps. And she will pop her head in to say hello.\n\nYou will be tense. You will be freaked out. There are several AWESOME reasons. ONE: few-and-far-between save points. Knowing you'll have to go back and suffer being hunted again will put you on edge. TWO: helpless. You are helpless, particularly at the beginning. If the alien grabs you, you are dead. And you will not go quietly into that good night. THREE: clever girl. She's smart. She's unpredictable. She hears you. She smells you. And you bet she'll see you if you aren't creeping and crawling your way through the level. And even if you take every precaution, every safe step, you STILL may come face to face with her. And then you're dead.\n\nDo you have to be a fan of the franchise? It helps, sure, but it isn't necessary (WATCH THE MOVIES FOR ME THOUGH). This is beautifully designed, beautifully paced, and beautifully terrifying. This is the Alien game we've been waiting for since 1979. This is redemption.

I bought the deluxe edition of this game on steam, which includes the season pass. From what I can see it gives you the other pre order DLC for this game, so that's Crew Expendable and Last Survivor.\n\nRight now that's get down to the actual game here shall we.\n\nThis game has done exactly what it was supposed to do, bring honor back to the Alien franchise. So during my playtime I had been taking in that epic atmosphere that this game creates. It feels like a real Alien experience, closely resembling the first film in how it creates that intense environment. The way it uses the music, lighting and atmosphere to create that suspense, a feeling of anxiety.\n\nThe story is so-so, I mean don't get me wrong..it's a great story with a great setting and background, however it just doesn't keep me glued to it, it also went on longer than you would expect and no, that's not always a good thing. The characters are also so-so, of course Amanda is probably the strongest out of the lot however Samuels and Nina seem to come across as rather..blank, but don't get me wrong, they are still great to have around. Now the most interesting thing about this game is..of course..the Alien, I well designed A.I that is just brilliant at creating that anxiety, I mean it's movements and how it reacts is so erratic, they really did create the perfect organism.\n\nRight well the game itself runs very well on PC, now I don't really have much experience with PC games at release but I can say that this game runs as smooth as butter.\n\nSettings wise it does give the user a range of choices to suit your liking, for instance film grain. For my experience I decided to turn off film grain as I wanted my experience to be more immersive. Now there are many other options to fiddle around with for instance Motion Blur, Particles, Depth of field, Chromatic Aberration, Planar Reflections and all the usual things you'd expect on a PC game. Now I've had no trouble playing this game so far, everything is maxed out, mostly.\n\nI'm going to be honest and say I am very impressed with this game, it fulfilled all my expectations. I was totally immersed in what was going on, and next to Shadow Of Mordor this is one of the more suprising games of the year. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of thr Alien series, in fact it's a must have, even if you're not an Alien fan or have no experience with the series I would still recommend buying it, it's a great and fun game full suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nSo don't be afraid to purchase this game because trust me, it's nothing like Alien Colonial Marines.\n\nHow will you survive?","October 6, 2014","true","16.4"," 147 of 202 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","147","202","0","1"

But the moment I saw the presentation on the creation of Alien: Isolation at EGX Rezzed '14, I was instantly hooked and somehow KNEW this will be good.\n\nAlien: Isolation is a natural and faithful extension of the original Alien universe in a way that movies would never be able to portray. It's crazy that it took 35 years for a video game to pay proper tribute to one of the best movies ever made. Creative Assembly really embraced Alien and it's showing every second.\n\nThere's not much to be said that others haven't: The art direction is outstanding, the visuals feel truly "next gen", the music draws from the original soundtrack, the sound effects are haunting, and the Alien really is the perfect organism.\n\nI've also played the experimental VR mode with the Oculus Rift DK2. The sensation of presence I've felt was just astounding, especially while being hunted. Instead of pushing buttons when hiding behind a corner, I literally stood up and leaned my head. It was a bit too much virtual reality for me; my heart is pounding, my hands are sweaty and my pants are soiled.\n\nThank you CA for such a wonderful experience and restoring (the) Alien to it's former glory!","October 11, 2014","true","20.0"," 67 of 80 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","67","80","0","3"

You got the opportunity to join a mission which could give you leads what happend with Ellen Ripley. Therefore your are flying with a small team to Sevastepol a space-station in the orbit of the gas giant KG348. As far you arrived there you realize that something on the station went horribly wrong. People are missing and rumours about a alien lifeform are spreading around. The rest is up to you, don't want to spoiler everything.\n\n\nGameplay\nWell I think the standarf for horror/stealth AAA titles. You can walk,run,crouch to move and peek around corners by holding CTRL+Direction Buttons. Helpful if you want to keep your cover and peek if the way is clear.\n\nGraphics\nIn Vanilla acceptebale but after tweaking the game files and building a ReShade preset you do not want to play in Vanilla anymore. The developers keept this old movie look which is pretty cool and nostalgic.\n\nAtmosphere / Sound\nThe big plus of the game! Alien Isolation is one of the games I enjoyes the most while playing it. It kinda feels like you were ported into another Alien movie. The old computers for example look and even sound like the ones from the movies. You can also hear something anytime. Rumbling vents, scratches, steps you will never feel alone and if it#s only the air ventilation working nearby. Then the music which keep you tense while moving around Sevastepol.. in the one minute quiet in the other literally screaming into your ear that you should hide.\n\n\nPersonal opinion\n\nOne of the best games I have played so far.

Buy it. Play it. Experience it. Even those who aren't familiar with the Alien franchise will enjoy this game. It's tense,  interesting, and very, very scary. However, the best thing about Alien: Isolation is how masterfully the Sevastopol was created. It's incredibly immersive, and fans of the original Alien are going to feel right at home. Yes, the game is (very) long. This is good. Horror games are usually too short and can sometimes be finished in one sitting. Alien: Isolation uses its time wisely, allowing the anxiety and fear to build. There's a rich story to unfold, not just a quick scare.\n\nSomething to note is that this game has many, sometimes long, periods where not much happens. These are not boring. They give the player a chance to explore and the game a chance to build tension/suspense. The times that you do face the Alien are heart-stopping. This game doesn't just throw a jump scare at you and consider its job done. You will sometimes have to contend with the Alien for long, drawn out periods of time as it stalks and searches for you. I could feel myself sweating every second. Alien: Isolation is what the Alien franchise has desperately needed, game-wise, for a long time. 9/10.\n\nP.S. It's also very refreshing to play a female protagonist, which is sadly still a rare feat in gaming. Amanda is a strong, defiant, well-rounded and independent heroine who's more than capable of fending for herself. She's a survivor. Well done, CA.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/recommended/214490/","rock1m1","Rock1m1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rock1m1/","149 products in account","Reviewer's note: I have played this game from start to finish , comprising over 35 hours, on a different account. Hence the steam playtime will not reflect such stat.\n\nAlso note this is a condensed form the review, as steam review word length prevented me from posting my full length review. For those interested for a in-depth review of this game, you can check it out here: http://headbangers-helm.blogspot.com/2014/10/alien-isolation-review.html\n\nBefore we begin, a word of warning: This game is not for the faint of heart. I have been a fan of the horror genre all my life, read many books, watched tons of films, but none managed to pull my fear strings as hard as Alien: Isolation.\n\nSo with that out of the way, let me tell you why this review is different compared to all the reviews I have done before. I wrote fragments of my impressions and thoughts on a notepad as a played through the game and used them as the basis of my review. It breathes more life into the review in a sense. Hope everyone finds it interesting!\n\nThis game, Alien: Isolation, is based on the late 70’s cult classic sci-fi horror flick: Alien. There have been numerous games based on the franchise, but only by name, which is pretty much the case for all movie licensed games sadly. However, Isolation is a different beast entirely. Where previous Alien games used the license just as a name to cover a lackluster game, this however is the most faithful recreation of the Alien universe or any film to game for that matter. It flawlessly manages to capture the very essence of the Alien franchise while harnessing the power of this interactive medium to further suck you into Ridley Scott’s sci-fi nightmare beyond the proficiency of films.\n\nYou play as Amanda Ripley, the descendant of Ellen Ripley. Amanda has been working for a mega corporation called Weyland-Yutani for a while now. Her main purpose for working with them was because the corporation had ties with the disappearance of her mother some 15 years ago. She finally gets a break which hopefully will shed some light to the answers she is looking for.\n\nGameplay\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, there is just one important thing the game emphasis more than anything else: is to Survive. All the impressive sound and visual design aren't just there for the sake of immersion, finally, they actually serve as very important gameplay systems. You need to keep your senses in full capacity because of the all the different kinds of dangers that are lurking all around the space station. Because of the desperate situation, many of the people over there who managed to keep themselves alive formed various groups in order to work together and try to survive. Unfortunately, that means they tend to keep it to themselves and will consider anyone outside of their group hostile, like yourself. It is suicide to go head to head against them if they outnumber you, so you need to carefully plan out what you are going to do. Will you take them on all by yourself? Will you try to sneak past them with the help of your gadgets and wits? Or will you take the help of the Alien by throwing a noise bomb which as expected emits a lot of noise for the Alien to swoop down from above and kill everything in the vicinity. You can also manipulate the machines in the station to give you an edge by hacking into the systems. The hacking mini-games are fun very well grounded to the world design around you.\n\nThen there are creepy androids or better known as Working Joe. They are basically a very simple version of synthetic humans in the Alien universe. Now, you never can trust robots no matter how friendly they appear to be at first, the same rule applies here. Some of the Joes are malfunctioning which is causing them to savagely kill any human that is not obeying the exaggerated rules planted into their head. What is even worse, they robots don’t go down easily and can take some serious punishment before it kneels over and dies with the same hollow look as if nothing happened. Yes, the Joes are perhaps the creepiest thing you will encounter in the game, more so than the Alien I felt. Something about their dead emotions, their stern attitude and the way they look at you with those dead eyes and talk in equally empty voice is very unsettling!\n\nGoing further up the top of the food chain we have, the Alien: it is unbeatable, unkillable and once it sees you there is a very good chance you are dead. So it is very important to make sure such a situation never even happens in the first place. In order to do that, you need to stay hidden as much as you can. Ripley is an engineer and just like her mom, a true survivor who can make the best out of the given situations. She can hide in lockers; hack terminals to alter some of the security systems around the space station to make new escape routes; use her extensive engineering skills to craft tools and gadgets like flash bang, Molotov cocktail, etc. to give her a better fighting chance and make it through. Despite all this help, it does not make your time any easier with the Alien lurking about, because the thing is…you are never safely hidden.\n\nYou are constantly being haunted most of the game by this vicious, hideous, merciless creature. That is 20 hours of constant tension and that is not even the only thing you need to worry about, the environment is very unpredictable and changes in hostile ways as the story progresses. So take a deep breath and hope you won’t break while you playing.\n\nVisual Presentation\n\nThe presentation can be summarized in one word: outstanding! The gorgeous lighting effects are some of the best I've seen and most effectively utilized like a horror game should. The way lights reflect when you point your flashlight around metal constructs like ventilation shafts, and further reflects back and radiates by bouncing off the surrounding metal plates, an effect called radiosity, is very hard to pull off in video games. This further gets complicated very easily when the surrounding surfaces where the light bounces off each other is made up of different materials, as different materials absorb light in different ways thus radiates differently. As you can you imagine, it is very computationally expensive to calculate such variables and thus many game out there do their best to fake this effect. However, the smart folks at Creative Assembly wouldn’t settle for anything less than realistic. They managed to find ways to achieve realistic light scattering and reflecting without bogging down hardware using a very impressive engine they made in-house for the game.\n\nSound\n\nAccording to science, even though visual memory is the most prominent form of memory, it is the memory that is recorded through sound that evokes the most powerful of emotions. So for a horror game, audio is incredibly important, if not more than the visuals. Well then, lucky for us, Creative Assembly completely nailed it here. This game has probably the most advanced sound design I've heard in gaming. It is there not just to create the hollow atmosphere, but it is probably the best tool at your disposal to survive. With you being inside of an aluminum shell, every sound is more pronounced than it normally is. The sound of thudding metal of something big and hulking by the vents and ceiling right on top of you can be very scary, but at the same time it gives you the opportunity to hear you're foes and make decisions: which is to either fight or flee (just flee when the sound is too heavy!).\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is amazing to think a lifelong RTS developer like Creative Assembly managed to make a survival horror game in the truest of the definition. I would like to end by saying that I loved every bit of my time at Sevastopol. I would love to return to it again but…definitely not anytime soon!","April 23, 2015","true","7.6"," 60 of 74 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","60","74","4","8"

You find out very soon that the Alien is the slightest threat you are facing, what more, sometimes the Alien may comes handy in some situations if you know how and when to lurk him (her? it?) into the centre of bunch of human enemies.\n\nAnyway, here comes the PROS:\n+ absolutely astonishing graphics and atmosphere, the feel of original Alien movie is in every corner\n+ outstanding music and audio.

(surprise surprise)\n\nThis game is beautiful. The sound and music are also on point. It's a very immersive environment that explores more of the Alien universe lore. I remembered watching the movie Aliens and wanting them to expand on Ripley's daughters life while she was in cryo-sleep. Decent crafting, and enough gadgets and weapons to get you by. Please note, this is not a run and gun first person shooter like the millenials keep wanting reskinned versions to play. This is more like Outlast or Prenumbra set in the Alien universe. Do not run in shooting everywhere or you will die. It's a survival game, not a hop around firing rocket launchers game.\n\nNow the bad. I can't stress enough, I got it yesterday, and was having fun with it the first few hours. However, I began noticing things. CA boasted that the alien possessed super duper state of the art artificial AI, (sound like another game they released last year?) but the alien actually spawns and teleports around the map near your vicinity. I've found myself hiding from him in a locker, and he just roams around the room, or the halls outside so you eventually have to get out of the locker and let him get you so you can reload your save and try again, and after reloading he's nowhere to be found.\n\nThere was one point where I was moving down a corridor, and there were 3 open ceiling vents above, and you can tell where he's at because you see a stream of drool dripping down onto the floor. I skirted around said vent so he couldn't grabe me, and guess what? The rain of drool immediately appeared in the 2nd, and then 3rd vent after that. These vents were not connected to each other, so how did he immediatly appear in the next one? If he knew where I was, why didn't he just drop down and kill me? (You can't outrun him if he sees you) Again, his "A.I." doesn't seem intelligent, just random spawning and cheap kills.\n\nI've watched him spot me from down the hall, run after me, and I made it into a room and hid in the locker.  He was RIGHT behind me at this point but once the locker door closed, he just turned and walked out.\n\nI've seen him walk past a human NPC that wasn't even sneaking and continue searching for me while I was hiding under a desk. Neither him nor the NPC acknoweledge one anothers presence.\n\nI have rarely felt like I've been outsmarted by this sophisticated A.I.. It mainly feels random and cheap when he finds me.\n\nThe human enemy A.I. is just a series of talking to each other and patrolling a set path while having predator like vision that can spot you crouching in the dark from 100 meters away and snipe you with a pistol somehow.\n\nA challenging game doesn't bother me, but I'm 34 and been a gamer for 29 years ever since my parents bought me my first NES. I can tell the difference between a challenging game and just random good/bad luck.\n\nOverall, the lore so far seems good, and the visuals are stunning, but I really wish modern game developers would focus on gameplay as opposed to flashy graphics to hold the attention of ritalin addled kids.\n\nIt's worth getting, but I'd wait until it's 20-30 dollars because I don't think it will be worth more than a 1 time playthrough.\n","October 13, 2014","false","18.6"," 424 of 662 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","424","662","9","25"

An answer, I have. Read on…\n\nI don’t like doing technical reviews. If you are looking for a technical one, there’s more in-depth and professional reviews on the web and here on Steam. Consider this a recommendation or a “personal evaluation”, if you'd like.\n\nAlso, I’m a big fan of Alien and Aliens, possibly one of the first films I ever watched as a child (bad parenting, I guess). Therefore, I maybe a little biased in my views. I pre-ordered the god-awful Aliens: Derp Marines on a whim just because I love the classic so much. Same story for Alien: Isolation, except this time I literally had no expectations. I had no expectations because Derp Marines was so bad it made me delete the “expectation” process from my brain. Yes, I had no expectations for Isolation, but I knew I wasn’t going to be disappointed.\n\nWith that being said, here’s why I think Isolation is so good and disappoint-proof:\n\nAuthenticity… (Did I spell that right?). Isolation is authentic. I repeated that word a 100 times over by now to everyone who’s ever asked me what I think of Alien: Isolation. The devs have put a lot of visible effort into this game to make it feel, look and sound just like the brilliant 1979 sci-fi film. Hell, they even brought the old crew to do some VA for Isolation, including Sigourney Weaver. Damn it was good hearing her do Ripley again…\n\ndrools…\ndrools some more.\nDone.\n\nEverything is so lovingly crafted to maintain that authenticity throughout the entire game. So much so that at times you will get nostalgic, as if you’ve “been there, done that”. Nothing has been left out, no corners were cut. The Alien, environments, lighting, effects, ultra-realistic futuristic DOS and CRT monitors – all of it. A fantastic recreation of the classic that captures the very essence of Ridley Scots gem to the point where you’d think he directed it.\n\nIt’s picture-perfect.\n\nWhy did they bother, you ask? Good question. Here’s a cookie.\n\nDevs know their audience. They’re not making CoD or Battlefield. They’re not making another Slenderman clone. They’re making the game many of us have wanted for decades. What we all knew could be done but no one was brave enough to do. CA took up the challenge, and boy, did they do a bang up job. By doing so they managed to keep the game terrifying, engaging, immersive, and what I would like to call “personal”. You are hunted by a nigh indestructible enemy, and you will die. Many times.\n\nIt’s about survival. It’s about instinct.\n\nYea, but like why?\n\nAlready answered that question. Pay attention.\n\nIGNorant rated this 5.9 so it must suck! Right?\n\nNo, it’s just one opinion. Those who have negative views on Isolation make some good points. However, it’s nothing that I personally see as a major flaw or anything that could distract you from what the game does very well.\n\nSigh… some technicality follows: There’s a good level of suspense early on in the game. You will meet your demise, but it will take time. It might feel sluggish a bit -you’re left wondering when the Alien’s showing up? I found myself lost quite a few times looking for that switch yada yada. Game doesn’t really hold your hand and tell you everything you need to know. And you aren’t really exactly always totally alone. Honestly, I can understand why some wouldn’t like how the game starts off. To top it off, the A.I does some pretty dumb and idiotic things. Gives me the creeps. All of this can lead to frustration, unfortunately.\n\nFinally, the devs added a really nice twist to saving your game. Needless to say I’ve never been this afraid of having to save my game (damn you CA. Damn you!!!).\n\nImportant Q: Can you make babies with the Alien?\n\nNo, you cannot. Why would you want to anyway, you freak.\n\nTl;dr\n\nI think Alein is a pretty cool guy. Eh kills people and doesn’t afraid of anything.\n\nDoesn't afraid of anything indeed.","October 17, 2014","true","32.7"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","50","61","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/recommended/214490/","InnerConflict","InnerConflict","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/","291 products in account","Alien: Isolation is a First Person Stealth Action Survival Horror Adventure game developed by Creative Assembly who previously only made Strategy games. Of course everyone was going to doubt that the game could be successful especially with SEGA as publisher, but OH BOY I NEVER HAD SUCH A IMMERSION TENSION JOYRIDE OF UNBELIEVABLE STEALTH SURVIVAL FUN. To put it simply: The best Alien game ever made to date. We are going in depth about the weaknessess and strengths of this game.\n\n\nStory:\n\nQuite simple: You play as Amanda Ripley, a Weyland Yutani Engineer/Technician who got contacted by Samuels, a Weyland Yutani Android, for helping him retrieving a black box from the Nostromo, the ship of Amandas Mum, the infamous Ellen Ripley. Amanda of course desperately searching for her since years, agrees and both head together with a crew and ship called Torrens, towards the destination: Sevastopol Station. Where not everything seems to be as it seems... Alien of course. The story develops further on and everything else would be a small spoiler, so we stay with just the summary.\n\n\nHumans & Androids, Gameplay Basics, etc:\n\nOf course as a heavily stealth focused survival horror game the AI of the alien, androids and humans (three main enemy types you will encounter) is important. Let´s begin with the humans and androids. Humans and androids have good hearing senses and can spot you quite fast from far if not hiding behind some object. Be careful. Their field of view is limited to a small front angle but within that angle they spot moving targets very quickly. Humans mostly carry weapons and use them with quite an accuracy, so be careful if starting a shootout. It´s more wise to distract them with flares or other gadgets. Androids are tricked or killed or stealthed the same way. They simply respond slower and react different. You craft gadgets by your own like noisemaker, flashbangs, etc. You find scrap and components on your way through the station which you use for crafting. Easy way to take care of androids: Later on you get even on medium difficulty enough shotgun ammo to just go face to face with an android and shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, one hit kill in the face, as long as no alien is in the proximity it´s the best method. Androids don´t use weapons.\n\n\nThe Alien AI:\n\nIt has a lack of eyes. Thing is, the alien has no real eyes, it uses sensoral techniques to sense its environment, meaning you could actually stand in front of one if it were dumb enough to not sense that you are not a human. But your heart rythm, warmth and other things indicate you are its target. Makes it harder to sense you when behind cover but it´s still possible if its sensors sense you strong enough and it notices you. The sensor has to detect something directly while other senses scan the environment with less sensitive efficiency. It´s not the perfect organism, but its an extremely dangerous animal that uses certain abilities of its host trademarks. Humans: walking up straight, full adult; dogs & cats, four legged and dumber, etc. More on lore on wiki. The behavior of the alien AI is adopting meaning it learns. You drag your attention across the whole room twice, it´s definitely going to be waiting for you the third time if it knows you use that route often. Its routing behavior compared to androids or humans is very aggressive and never set, so be thankful if it doesn´t see you quickly hiding somewhere even if you were uncovered for a sec. The alien crawls in the vents most of the time, if it comes down it never looks your way and if it does, due to it´s temporarily blindness that moment, lets you often but not always give enough time to hide. It works like this: You enter a new area, you can explore a bit, make sure you memorize hiding spots, it comes down, you hide. You wait till it goes back into the vents and you can continue, but be careful it´s unpredictable, it can come down anytime, depending on its mood it can come down immediately after climbing up too. You can hide in lockers, small shifting units, under tables, everything really works, even simply cowering behind crates.\n\n\nSaving Points aka Checkpoints:\n\nThere are no autosaves. You can only save at save stations which take some time so the alien can still attack you while saving, it actually never happened for me, you really have to be a loud dork in order to make it attack you during saving. There are always enough save points so don´t worry about dark souls like progress loss. Save points are often designed to be reused during backtracking for new objectives.\n\n\nBacktracking, Level Design, Balancing, Objectives:\n\nThe reason I didn´t found the backtracking annoying was because you are always send to new areas and objectives, you only backtrack through once played areas because they are on the way for the elevator or ladder which you need to use in order to get to the new area. Stealth works on it and the game simply works. Level Design was done in a excellent job. Always alternative ways or hiding spots and tables and just a very good amount of levels designed simply to work for stealth or action. Balancing simply works too, you always find enough stuff for crafting, you always find the stuff you want in order to craft something special. You always find enough ammo in areas where you are able to shoot or fight and you always have enough hiding spots for 100% stealthing also called ghosting if you should run out of ammo against androids or humans once. Still be careful with ammo and especially gadgets and mines/bombs/molotovs. They are simply too useful in order to waste em on humans or the alien. Androids can really be ♥♥♥♥♥es in this game.\n\n\nAtmosphere, Variety of Levels, Game Length, Graphics, Port Report (Optimization), etc.:\n\nLike mentioned earlier you always go into new areas, later on in the game you will go to the reactor and other really incredible awesome places, walks outside the station and a nostalgia dripping derelict mission. I really loved how every new level felt unqiue and satisfying and they really pulled it off to drag the player into a 100% immersion tube. Just sucking away at the atmosphere and incredible lighting. The graphics overall are beautiful and fantastic! Only a few low res textures here and there but you don´t notice them anyway. It´s a really great port! I checked it and my R9 280X always was 60fps+ sometimes rampaging at 180fps! It had a usage of 99% all the time, my Xeon E3 1230 v3´s cores were all from 25 to 50% and the RAM was about 3,7GB high. Incredible low usage of VRAM! Only about 700MB at the beginning to max 1GB at huge scenes. This game is playable with cards like a 9800gtx or maybe even older, of course a 9800gtx only has 512MB VRAM so it depends on your settings. The game looks fantastic even on lowest settings! Only shadows should stay at medium if possible and lighting should be turned on, or else you might experience a major atmopshere loss. There´s a typical lack of anti aliasing options, so you will always have to fight with edges, it´s endurable with FXAA or any forced edge detected filter but, I wished they would have implemented good old MSAA. Downsampling, yup... seems like many have problems with it, but who knows... I personally don´t try that out. The game is about 20 to 24 Hrs long easily. Maybe 18. Last of Us length to Thief 2014 length. You really get a lot for your money. Occulus Rift supported by rewriting a file.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nExcept for the AI misbehaviors here and there, the backtracking and the often use of pull this or that lever, everything works, everything is fun and it gave me a really great time onboard the Sevastopol. Easily 9/10 if played by core gamers with brains. Some stealth like bakas and wonder why they die.","October 31, 2014","true","23.6"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","37","41","0","2"

A stealth game done so perfect with such a dreadfull atmoshphere and at the same time a huge amazing space station that is very detailed . The controls are spot on and for the first time in ages i can truly say if you die in this game it is your own fault that is how smooth the control and level desighn and A.I.  work together  . As a huge fan from the original not the lame AvsP movies this story is dead on with the mytho of the the alien/Ripley story line . If you like stealth , horror , or just well put together games this is a must but i will tell you if you are one of the run and gun crowd and cant stand still then stay away this is a true stealth game . Sam fisher cant even come close to this depth and style of stealth .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IvanDankov/recommended/214490/","IvanDankov","Ivan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IvanDankov/","547 products in account","I have to say that I simply can not recommed this game because I don't have any words or breath for it.\n\nIt is SO good! Literally SOOOO GOOD! 'Sega' and 'Creative Assembly' took all the best pieces from the original movie - sounds, characters, THE Alien of course and something in between stealth and action and turned into a game. What we got is just what we (Alien movie/game fans) were waiting for and deserved after years and years of badly made Alien adaptions (e.g. 'Aliens Colonial Marines').\nAfter less than a year it costs -75% less on Steam wich is also a good way to have alot of people playing it and support/see their work.\n\nThe game takes place between the very first Alien movie and the (in my opinion) even better second part.\nYou slip into the role of 'Amanda Ripley' (daughter of 'Ellen Ripley' – main protagonist in the Alien movies)  and holy smokes it has never been more awesome playing a female main character like that since 'Tomb Raider'. Shes overall just so perfect fitting for a "prequel" of Alien 2 and develops over time until the very end which was quiet a surprising one to me.\nAmanda found out that there is a possibility that her mother is still alive and is now tracking down the signal searching for the truth ...first you encounter human enemies, later on Hiwis and then finally....THE ALIEN!\nIt became rare to avoid enemies in shooters these days and being afraid of them.. (Slender was NOT scary) but it could be just lurking around every corner ready to kill you and once it spotted you - will follow you almost anywhere!\nIt surely is frustrating at times but once you succeded it feels so satisfying..\n\nThe main focus on the game is more causing the Alien to retreat or aviod it rather than rush the main tasks and go back home and thats what i love about it.\nI also have to admit that i mostly hate modern survival games since its all about crafting ..but in this game is so perfectly implemented that you can't do anything but love it. With a wide range of useful stuff (medic-kits, smoke grenades, emp-mines etc.) and also guns (Pumpgun, Flamethrower, Revolver and so on) you are more or less ready for action..\n\nThe graphics are just astonishing and work on Ultra setting just fine for me (Using a 660ti for this game) especially the lightning takes my breath away everytime.\nThe gameplay is sometimes fast and hasty, sometimes slow and tactical and overall the best I could imagine for this game.\nNot matter what difficulty you chose - you die - ALOT! thats where i ragequitted multiple times and finished the game just now but I regret, not doing it earlier, it's so great once you are through and I'll peek into the DLC Missions and Challenges but the basic version of this game should be more than enough for anyone who wants the real Alien feeling in a video game.\n\nAchievments are more or less unlocked by completing story Missions or collecting stuff, but the references to the movies are worth it. The metascore of 81/100 is something you should ignore. You should rely on the 93% positive reviews on the Steam Storepage (out of over 10.000) they are there for a reason.\n\nDo I need to say more?\nIf you are an alien fan since its very beginning ... why are you even reading this.\nIf you are new to the series you should get it on a sale for ~12 bucks. With over 20 hours of gameplay its definately one of the most story and gameplay-rich games of recent years.","July 17, 2015","true","18.8"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","38","45","6","0"

While I don't necessarily think it's the scariest game out there, it's very atmospheric and is a very enjoyable experience.\n\nThe game's character is the daughter of Ripley from the movie Alien 1. While on a mission to find the whereabouts of her mother, she finds herself stranded on a decaying space station filled with the horrors caused by the murderous alien on board.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is gorgeous. You are put in a first person perspective which makes the experience very immersive. The graphics, music, and sound effects give it the feel as if it is part of the original movie. There are even sound clips from the movie that I recognize, intermingled with the new voice acting. There are tons of small details in the environment to be appreciated and it's the small details that really give it a great look.\n\nThe story is quite well-developed. There are a few cut scenes but it's not overbearing. There are numerous voice recordings scattered around that leave tidbits of story.\n\nApart from the look and feel of the game, the game mechanics are great and they make the game challenging. Simply put, this game has done a lot of things right that other horror games did wrong. Let me try to list a few things:\n\nWhile there are weapons, ammo is limited and they seem very ineffective on hard mode. This keeps the game's spirit as a survival horror game and not another action game with horror elements like half-life or bioshock. The stealth mechanics are essential and you will simply get killed if you make too much noise. This includes running and even using your motion detector!\n\nThe alien is pretty unpredictable and its very sensitive to noise. In games such as outlast or amnesia, you could eventually figure out the path the AI is taking and avoid it quite easily. This game is harder in difficulty, which really adds to the experience. Not to mention, the alien can open up lockers!\n\nThe maps are not linear and there's many spots to explore. The game forces you to scavenge for parts, since items such as medkits and smoke grenades must be crafted. You also have a limited battery on your flashlight. This is a great game mechanic that was neglected in games like Amnesia 2.\n\nThere are other little interesting mechanics that add to the experience. You can only save the game at save points which adds to the danger when you are trying to sneak around an enemy. When hacking the security systems, you must solve a simple puzzle but time is not paused. It's possible for enemies to sneak up on you while you are interacting with the simple puzzles.\n\nAlien: Isolation has just about everything I expect in a horror game. Great immersive atmosphere, detailed story, solid and challenging gameplay elements add to the experience.","August 16, 2015","true","34.1"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","26","27","4","0"

The Xenomorph is terrifying, and can get you anytime. While you play, time flies. I spent 30 minutes to get a keycard and get back because the Xeno's AI is unpredictable. However this is not a minus here. Although the Alien always wanders near you, it can't pinpoint your location, except if you make too much noise. But there is no place, where you can feel yourself completely safe. I hid in a locker, but it sensed my breath, and killed me. And on top of that the Xeno is not the only thing you should fear about. There are "malfunctioning" androids, known as Working Joes. They can't instakill you, but they are more than the Xeno. Okay, enough about the enemies. I can run the game on 1440x900 Ultra with an i3-4130K GTX 660 and 8 GB RAM, which is a pretty middle category PC today. I couldn't notice any framedrops, so it's well optimized. The graphics are breathtaking, especially the machines, and rooms from the Alien movies. The devs got access to a lot of data from 20th Century Fox, so they used most of them. And there is a little film grain effect, which makes it even more retro. As for bugs: I found a few, but if you don't try to go into a cutscene room while crouching, and looking into the other direction, the script should work :P\n\nVerdict: Amazing game for Alien and horror fans.

This is it!\n\nGood things:\n\n+Graphics + sound = authentic atmosphere. Really good, to the point that one feels he's in that corp-forsaken station.\n\n+Creature is fantastic - movement, sounds, reactions. AI is not abnormally smart, nor entirely predictable, solid for this type of game.\n\n+Game makes you feel quite uncomfortable, sometimes frustrated, often scared and rarely alleviated as you reach the save point. After reaching one, you still want to see what's behind next corner.\n\n+Interesting approach to weapons and ammunition. They feel like most rudimentary things put together to be at least somewhat efficient in dealing with threats, against the Alien they are junk though. Yet useful against other types of poential foes if used correctly. Ammunition is scarce, Ripley isn't a great shot either (exactly how it should be).\n\n+Different approaches to situations is always a bonus. Not a Deus Ex, but mostly provides player with options.\n\n\nWeak parts:\n\n-Sub-par facial animation. Too bad, at our age it could have been better as models themselves are great.\n\n-Too many upgrades for tools and quite rare uses for each of them (welding torch, hacking device). Every new upgrade unlocks only several doors. 3 upgrades for each craftable item is an overkill. Feels like they had nothing else to put character development wise and decided to make it up with upgrades for items.\n\n-Practically no interaction with other humans except for direct combat or evasion. This could have had more layers.\n\n-Inconsistency in human stealth segments. Often human AI sees you way too well to the point that stealth is not even an option.\n\n\nPolarizing aspects:\n\n+/- Difficult on easy, due to specifics of combat and checkpoints being your own saves and beginning of an episode.\n\n+/- Game is quite long, important aspect for a game with such impressive discomfort factor. If one enjoys the atmosphere, stealth and punishing difficulty - it's a treat. If not - frustartion will arise. Others call it a problem with pacing, to which I do not agree as the pace is exactly the same from start to finish with small differences in specific parts (meeting Alien for the first time, having to survive without weapons, going at it in the end).\n\n+/- Backtracking. I enjoy it when I like the game. But the important part is that you don't have to do it if you're not going for 100% collectible run. And if you are, then you should enjoy the game based on that decision.\n\nFor an Alien fan = must play (full price acceptable).\nFor a survival horror fan = definite check (full price acceptable but better to wait for some discount).\nTo a stealth game fan = recommended check (wait for a discount).\nRest approach at your own discretion, this is not a game for the meek.\n\n\nUPDATED 21/12/14 info below:\n\nDidn't want to write regarding DLCs from the start and generally wait it out a bit. I can say that they are well done with only some noticable reusage of previous location parts, generally adding quite a few new tilesets and having their own unique level designs. Locations presented here are the ones which we as players cannot visit in original game due to different story occurances.\n\nFor those who are willing to compete for times and scores or experience story of other characters on the station, Survivor DLC is a proving ground of skill, wits and luck. For those who wish to enjoy a story perspective it is as rewarding as nothing is pushing on player to go for the scores/time. Perspective of Ransome and Lingard + upcoming characters is adding much appreciated level of richness to the story happening on Sevastopole.\n\nNostromo and Crew Expendable DLCs are really well done as they take exact moments from the Alien movie (last minutes of Ellen's escape to Narcissus and Dallas's decision to go to vents after Alien) with albeit slight additions and capitalize on them masterfully. In Crew Expendable player has the right to choose between characters and see canon version of ending (in case of Nostromo) or delve into speculation of what might have happened/or did happen if someone else would go after the Alien (Crew Expendable). Voice acting is fantastic with most of the original actors reprising their roles with additional audio logs providing even more insight. It's a treat for a fan to relive the same moments yourself.\n\nI managed to replay game quite a few times and new additions like Novice and Nightmare difficulties make the experience even better suited for all types of players. I must say I love to come back to it and enjoy the atmosphere, design and tension on a regular basis.\n\nAfter that I wholeheartedly and honestly change my score for Alien Isolation up to 9/10.","October 19, 2014","true","180.5"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","4"

Creative Assembly, I have to applause you! You guys did it.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is amazing; the machines, lighting, architecture, etc. Everything's awesome! I also recommend you to play with some decent sound system, the audio is spooky and very reminiscent to the Alien films.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty good as well. The control mechanics are simple and easy to remember; the crafting system is really helpful, and it actually makes sense, since you're an engineer. The enemies act in unexpected ways and often offer quite a challenge. You have lots of places to hide. Learn how to use them with caution.\n\nAlas, I can't contribute with the story at this stage of the review (I will update later). But, so far, the secret of trying to discover the whereabouts of your mother, as the legend Ripley, seems pretty interesting.\n\nConcluding (update coming soon), this game is a must have for any Alien or horror fan. It's scary, it has incredible graphics and sound effects, the enemies' A.I. is unpredictable and actually works here. Well, what are you waiting for?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxeel/recommended/214490/","dxeel","-P|T- DxeeL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxeel/","234 products in account","Personal review of : Alien Isolation. First of all, I've got to commend Creative Assembly for this superb release. Honestly, a studio that's never tackled a FPS game, completely blew all my expectations for this game. I was worried, you see, just like you I got burned hard by A:CM and Gearbox. I swore never to buy a gearbox game again, but after all the trailers, all the hype and the talk, I went into this game expecting to be dissapointed. What I was though was massively impressed. Oh where do I even begin? First of all let's get this out of the way, Alien Isolation feels like a true next-gen game (except for the mo-cap). Graphics are amazing. Lighting, volumetric smoke, the enviroments really feel crafted by hand, all of them. Everything is "fluid" in the sense of an Aliens game. The level design works against you, long dismal corridors serve to alienate(no pun intented) the player, while it servs a greater purpose to the Alien. The technophobia and aesthetics of the 70's sci-fi vision of the world is nailed so perfect on so many levels. Graphics, sound, setting, mood, atmosphere. It's all here. Story wise it falls a bit short, Amanda as a character doesn't quite reach her peak IMO.Instead it feels more like a streched cat&mouse chase. She starts off innocently enough seeking closure after the disappearance of her mother. What ensues afterwards is a long strech of corridors, backtracking, fixing the station etc. The point is that the story feels a bit secondary compared to the meat of the game. Sneaking and surviving. Which are pretty well made, except for a lack of actual indication as to how "visible" you are, but I personally embrace this choice, since it makes it less video-game-y and more of an experience. Dodging, sneaking and outsmarting the Alien reflect how well you react in these situations. There is just so much depth to the game, it's amazing how few bugs I've actually encountered during my playtime (It's twice the amount on steam, I pirated before I bought it). Anyways, you can stealth through the entire game, with the exception of a few forced android fights. Stealth works fine, combat is a bit shallow, the NPC survivors are kinda dumb, the focus being on the xeno. Other areas pin you against other enemies, but generally speaking if you are patient enough you can stealth almost 90% of the game (I did it on the hardest difficulty without any human casualites). To wrap up this review, I highly recommend Alien:Isolation to pretty much all fans of the licence and fans of the horror genre, AI so advanced in a horror game is trully a blessing, the god damn Alien reacts to your motion detector's sounds for pete's sake and since you can never learn the "pattern" of the Alien. Crafting and salvaging are also a big part of the game, but yet again it comes to your personal preference (which stuff to use), the only useful items I can think about are the noisemakers, health kits and molotovs.\nThe Good:Superbe graphics\nGood voice acting\nPlays&Feels like a next-gen experience\nXeno AI is the best seen so far in any game\nPlenty of respect and love for the source material, best use of Alien material in a videogame\nDLC's offer up so many new maps & a few new modes, Good to sink in some extra hours\nOne of the best optimized games of 2014\nMassive game ( up to 15-25 hours on a first playthrough)\nSeegson's role in the game is the best deviation from the tired old storyline\nCrafting and salvaging parts encourage exploration\nAudio logs recorded with the original staff from Alien 1979The bad:Amanda as a character and the overall story are kinda average\nSUBJECTIVE: Game is reusing plenty of enviroments, since backtracking is a huge part of it, might dissapoint some people\nHuman AI is a bit lackluster\nForced combat sections in a primarily stealth focused game\nFrom time to time you'll suffer some "unfair" deaths on part of the Alien's unpredictable AI\nSequel bait ending\n\nIt gets a personal rating of 9/10, story was weaker, backtracking hurt a bit but overall it's a massively enjoyable experience. Alien's fans will love this, probably the best adaptation ever.  P.S. The DLC's for this game are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.","October 27, 2015","true","16.0"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","4"

It also happens to be one of the most engaging and immersive horror games ever made, as well as a fantastic sci-fi experience with an immense amount of detail to draw you into this nightmarish scenario. The Alien itself is rightly the centrepiece and star of a game which delivers it in a form that is equal parts intelligient, disturbing and challenging. It not only seems to think for itself but comes across as a truly frightening and intimidating enemy. One you cannot kill or outrun. You can only evade and outmsart it.\n\nGameplay is largely composed of simplistic mechanics and stealth but their simplicity only goes miles towards keeping the game approachable but also surpirsingly complex in its design. With minimal hud or menus you are left to fully immerse yourself in the world, with a variety of options to see you through some of the most terrifying levels ever concieved of in a game. Even the save game mechanic is a brilliant and effective example of making a simple device do a lot of work for the experience. Some may find it frustrating at times, with the unpredictable AI seeming to put you in unbeatable situations. Those who succeed and progress will realise that only their own ingenuity will see them through, managing a careful balance of educated guesses and risk taking.\n\nThe atmosphere and worldbuilding too are of astounding quality that echo the successes of other greats in the genre like Bioshock or its ancestor System Shock 2. All of this is helped by excellent sound design and a wonderful score largely but appropriately borrowed from the original film. Its story turns out to be a surprising strength as well, with mostly rounded characters and a fine protagonist in Amanda Ripley. Her human drama at the heart of the plot ties the whole nightmare together without ever feeling forced or cheap. A lull at the beginning of the third act threatens to drag the experience down but before it can become tedious its right back into the terror for some of the finest sections of the game.\n\nAll in all a masterful game. Not without flaws but due to its fine craftsmanship and daring ambition, it delivers something unique for both fans of the Alien series and those of horror videogames. A rare achievement in gaming and one that deserves to be played. IF you have the nerves for it.","October 12, 2014","true","49.3"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","0"

Its Amnesia like game on Alien universe and it is even better. Main protagonist Amanda Ripley try to find out what happend with her mother  Ellen L. Ripley.Few years after Nostromo incident. She travel to space station Sevastopol which have Nostromo black box. Things get hairy pretty quick and it is done remarkable.\n\n+ Lighting yes on horror game is very important and here is just great\n+ Nice detailed world based on Alien "future" vision from the movie\n+ Not scrypted Alien . Yes its true he actually learn from your moves . So some tricks might stop working after few uses. It forces  you to think up front where to hide. Alien is cheassy one he can even search room, leave it and just run back to it to make sure you are not here. Very sensitive to noise on higher difficulty can even her you montion tracker ;) In short if you repeat game maybe main story and items will be same. But  Alien him self is always diffrent on every encounter.\n+Hardcore sneak simulator i mean it. Ofc you have weapons gadgets and stuff you actually can run but is worst idea to run you will see ;)\n+Not everyone is hostile listen to people before show your face to not be suprised/let down.\n+Nostromo Logs collectables with orginal  Alien cast\n+High replayability value\n+Good sound and optimalization\n+So good details and ost from movie makes you feel like in one actually.\n\n-Sometimes Alien can be frustrating not often still sometimes you can hang around quite a while before even move.\n-Alien movie Mission play as E. Ripley destroy Nostromo and run to crio pod on DLC .\n- A bit too much working joes (robots) yes it made game harder along with Alien around still is bit too much.\n- Ending points to next game and still nothing about it. Shame  a real waste.\n\nIts really hard to hook up on something on this game. If you are disapointed after Colonial Marines or new AvP this game is what you are looking for. Especailly if you are Alien or Amnesia games fan. I highly recommand this game to everyone.   Take your time on Sevastopol station.","December 29, 2015","true","40.6"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","21","22","4","2"

The game was unforgivingly difficult, and I loved every second of it. It's a magnificent survival horror game, and it captures the tense and deperate atmosphere of the orignal Alien movie flawlessly. Scrounging in a panic for supplies to build just one more noisemaker to distract the Alien again when I might need it, or desperately looking for flamethrower fuel to hold him at bay just one more time for when (and I mean when) he eventually spots me again...\n\n9.5/10. This game was damn near perfect.\n\nI should mention I went through the game on Hard my first playthrough, which I've noticed was far more challenging than my friend's experience who went through the game on Normal for Xbox One. He was able to blast through enemies with abandon, and didn't suffer for it. For me, getting hit twice at most killed me and gunfire drew the Alien to my loaction. If you're worried about the game's difficulty being too high, you can play on a lower difficulty and have a much easier time of it. You can also change the game's difficulty mid-game if need be, so don't be afraid to go hard and play the game the way it was meant to be played. You can always drop down to completely the great story later if it's too much of a challenge.","December 13, 2014","true","28.1"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"

For the most part at least. The game is quite good at building suspense, thanks to its good visuals and absolutely top notch sound effects, backed up by excellent soundtrack (consisting of both original compositions and familiarly sounding excerpts from film's score) and mostly well done scripting.\n\nThe AI is good, with occasional hiccup here and there (mostly xenomorphs failing to navigate some tight spots, but that does not happen often), and weapon mechanics are... functional, though it is certainly not an action FPS. The crafting mechanic is a bit shallow, though it adds a bit to the tactical aspect of the game. I also enjoyed the story and many references to original filmography (though I understand that non-fans will not appreciate much of the material in the game), as well as the overall freshness of the gameplay.\n\nOn the other hand the game tends to be very heavy handed with QTEs at times, and some action animations are well overdone - it annoyed me when Ripley, chased by an Alien, tried calmly and carefully put away the door block after disarming it, with no way to hasten her actions. Xenomorph AI can also provide many cheap deaths, with aliens seemingly travelling at the speed of light between vent exits. Some cutscenes carry a bit too much Classic Videogame ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t(TM) for my taste, and there were at least two instances in the campaign where I really didn't understand the hell was I doing (maybe I haven't listened well enough, who knows) and at least two baffling occurences.\n\nAs for the technicals, well, the game runs well even on my GT 740M equipped notebook, so it's quite well optimised. Unfourtunately, on my main AMD-based rig this game gave me a lot of trouble. I got messed up models and animations, missing special effects, broken text ingame, unexplained framerate drops, and worst of all a horrible memory leak that stalked me during my playthrough like a hungry xenomorph. And mind you, it's a fairly solid rig (i might put it somewhere in my profile for reference). All this in an AMD-branded game! Those issues must be ironed out with a patch and/or driver update from interested parties, and soon, before main wave of DLCs hit. So much for "gaming evolved", eh?\n\nOverall - this is a well done take on the universe first presented to us in 1979. It expands on it, but does not break it, and fans will find a lot to enjoy (and a few little things to argue about) here. Others may complain about dragged on sequences in the last third of the game and often frustrating AI behaviour. I have enjoyed it and, while it's by no means a perfect organism, should it be patched and should the DLC's provide gameplay worth their price, it will be probably the best non-crossover Alien game so far.\n\nLast word. I can't lie to you about your chances while playing on the hardest difficulty, but... you have my sympathies.","October 21, 2014","true","33.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","2"

The first 5 hours of this game were some of the best I'd experienced in a game, but after 25 hours, I was ready to quit.\n\nEverything about the game looks and sounds amazing, making the player feel as though they are really there.\n\nThe alien that hunts you is not fully scripted, but AI controlled and unpredictable. Players must hide or use makeshift implements to distract it.  While this is sometimes great, it becomes frustrating when you die over and over.  The first death is shocking and scary.  The tenth is just tedious.  A lot of it comes down to poor level design.  The Nostromo DLC missions, and some places in the main game, like the escape pod sequence, are outstanding.  Too many other places are way too cramped or lack the ability to maneuver effectively.\n\nMany sequences in the game involve these very creepy and uncanny androids that have turned hostile.  Despite the great visual design, encounters with these things often turned into a Benny Hill sequence of running around a table a dozen times as they chased me.\n\nThere's a thin line between a horror experience being tense and being frustrating, and this game frequently breaks it.  The presence of constant save stations broke the immersion, and are a sign that the designers intended players to die frequently, which as I've said saps games of tension.  Amnesia: The Dark Descent handled things much better, through the use of checkpoints to ease players dieing too often.\n\nThe game needed more quiet moments, perhaps filled in with some puzzle elements (Ripley is supposed to be an engineer, so an organic way to implement this could be her fixing various parts of the station).  The game is also way too long.  There felt like there were 2 or even three moments when the game was going to end, but it kept going, long after the gameplay had shown all it had to offer.\n\nThe worst offender, though, was that we simply encounter the alien way, way too much.  After a certain point, the player is so accustomed to the creature, and has had the time to figure out all the gamey ways to get around it, that it's no longer scary.  That's why the most effective horror movies or games show the monster only sparingly, so that the player is not familiar with it.\n\nI do look forward to a sequel to this game, and I think with a few tweaks, like a more intricate level design and a more sparing use of the alien, it could be a remarkable experience.","June 24, 2015","false","25.9"," 193 of 325 people (59%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","59","193","325","11","14"

Did it see me? Let me hide.  It's coming close (pause) ok it's gone. NOPE I'M DEAD!\nThe Game (Sh!t Your Pants Delux Addition)\n\nThis game is what I have been waiting for. This is an Alien game that is about hiding and stealth, over running and gunning. You need to out stealth the Alien and everything else that breathes.\n\nSo how well is the stealth done?\nIt is done well but there is one or two things that could be worked on.\n\nThe Good:\nYou can rehide if found\nThere is mulitiple ways to distract enemies\nYou make enemies fight each other\nMotiontracking is done well (And adds to atmosphere very well with the classic tracking sound!)\nNot all hiding spots are not equal\nWeapons are scarce\nCrafting allows you to build what you need\nDetection not based off of lighting. Sight lines and sound are very inportant!\nYou can peak around corners\n\nThe Bad:\nThe A.I.  can be unbalaced sometimes. It can very from you can walk right past NPCs, to them walking right up to where you are hiding and shoving their hand up your @ss to making a puppit out of you. But this rarely happens.\n\nThings other than stealth:\nThis is a game that should be played with headphones for full effect of sh!t your pants horror.\n\nThe voice acting is over all good but can seem forced at times. ( I only noitce the force in the begining of the game)\n\nThe terminals are a good way to get backstory because if you don't care you can just skip over them. You get all the plot you need from the cutscenes.\n\nThe maps are well designed the attion to detail is fantastic. There is always a path through and if you can't find one you can make one with distractions.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is very well done. Nothing gets the heart pumping and the poo flowing than your Motiontracker going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, when the Alien run over your head in the vents. (Example below)\n\nAfter sneaking into a room and hiding under a table to plan my next move, I noticed motiontracker was going crazy.\nAt this point all the humans in the area decided to have a rave and the Alien was invited. Feeling alittle awkward (because I wasn't invited) I stayed under the table. Then the Alien arrived with a sparkle in this teeth and a hunger in his tummy, but someone forgot to bring snacks. At this point the Alien killed the humans and drop the bodies in front of me. When this happend I promptly sh!t myself. With his job done he retuned to the vents and slept.\n\nThis was awesome! It made me feel like a protagonist in a horror movie! That body drop was classic! Plus the Alien and humans just did this with no help from me.\n\nIt can also get really tense when you are hacking and the Alien stomping around behind you.\n\n11/10\n(Would sh!t pants again)\n\nGeneral gameplay tips:\nStay out of lockers and half lockers (I've died more in these than any where else)\nWith "Working Joes" if you can't loot them they aren't dead!\nIn the begining of the game save your flares you'll need them for the first stealth section.\nIf you can't find the Alien on the motiontracker look at the vents on the ceiling If ♥♥♥♥ is driping out, it's right there.\nWith the lean it dosen't make you invisible. If you lean for too long you will get seen.\n\nThat is stuff I have noticed.","October 6, 2014","true","21.9"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","26","33","0","0"

Man screams, obviously.\n\nAlien: Isolation is the very definition of Survival Horror drawing it's influences from one of the best survival horror movies in the history of cinema - Alien. Creative Assembly (a studio best known for Total War games) has managed to create one of the most atmospheric immersive game world's I've ever experienced.\nEven if you've never seen the Alien movie, this game will draw you right into the it's world with some of the best lighting and soundtracks I've ever experienced in a game. It's even more of a bonus if you have seen the movies, as you'll be drawn into a world that seems familiar... perhaps too familiar, as I found myself totally drawn into the game yelling out 'NOOOO!' whenever I was attacked by Alan, the French sexpest Xenomorph.\n\nIn fact the entire mythos of the Alien haunts you throughout the game, with the level of expectation and suspense building up almost constantly.\nThe OST ques and motiffs drawn from the original Jerry Goldsmith OST, only the music is static it's dynamic and swells and ebbs with the action. There were times when the music was pounding causing fear and panic, and the Alien wasn't even on the screen. If this game doesn't win an award for it's OST and Sound Design than I'll be lost for words.\n\nThere are some issues with the game, such as the pacing. I felt as though a few chapters stretched the game out longer than it needed, even if they were designed to allow you to rest and regain composure after some hectic momenets. Yet, I don't feel it ruined the game.\nI'm trying to avoid going into too much detail as I don't want to ruin the game, as ultimately this is a game best experienced; played in the dark with headphones on with the screen a foot away from your vision. Go in blind and enjoy.\n\nIn short - an amazing experience for Alien fans and perhaps one of the true great Alien games available today. It really captures the essence to the Alien movie in both spirit and gentle nods. Might be a frustrating experience for some, who don't understand the aura around the creature stalking you.","October 13, 2014","true","22.7"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

It is my personal game of the year, at least.\n\nThe atmosphere soaks you up right from the start to the end. The graphics are REALLY outstanding..like one of the best your average nerd eyes were ever flattered with . Those lightning effects especially. Alien Isolation's AI is, aside from a few minor bugs, the best I've ever came across. You don't need to be a diehard ALIEN-fan to enjoy this experience.\n\nWe all remember the comparatively mediocre Colonial Marines. This game is what all Alien-fans waited for so long and makes up for everything the predecessor messed up.

I neither can recommend it nor can't recommend it. But I really want to let you know what I thought about this game when I finished it.\n\nAlien: Isolation started really strong for me. What I saw in the trailers and first gameplays made me feel like I have to play this game really bad. A Alien game with survival elements? That HAS to be good. So I thought at least.\nThe first hours with this game began and everything they made wrong in the last Alien: Colonial Marines where made better or are even fixed. Graphics are brilliant, the story in the first hours was very thrilling and even the survival part started to get interesting with more materials you are able to collect and crafted items which will help you to get through your journey.\n\nBut thats all about it. The missions you get while continuing the game become more or less the same. Go to that place X - turn on the generator/press that button/get that item/code/keycard - go to the place X back - find out you need a something else and go to place Y. After a while it really gets annyoing if you have to walk back through the whole section just to obtain something you need to progress. Everytime you think you're finally at the destination something happens and you have to accomplish something else first. That might be the sense behind that game - while you are also chased by that Alien - but after 5 hours it really IS repetitive and feels like artificially extended.\n\nApropos Alien. Yes. You're getting chased by ONE Alien, thats not killable and will be more and more aggressive in the lategame. Thats not bad at all to have the feeling you always need to hide or run away, right? The problem with this Alien is that it will kill you instantly on sight. You can't run away anymore if you don't have a molotov or the flamethrower with enough ammo to scare it away. Near the end it just appears again and over again in situations where you can't really hide or wait too long till it will go up the vents again. I am patient but not patient enough to wait on one place 5 mins with the hope it will disappear again. It also reacts to sounds/noises, e.g. fighting/shooting/running. After you first encounter that thing you really have to sneak or slowly walk 80% of the game. It slows down the progress but won't be a big deal if you're patient enough.\n\nThe next point I really didn't like was the fact, that you can't gather all materials which are lying around in the area. You always have a limit for every material you will find. Some are limited to 3 per material, some to 9 per material. That makes the crafting part really difficult. You don't know when you will find the next sensor or the next cable. That made me stack up and just craft items when I really need them. I always left a lot of materials behind through that and this destroy the whole crafting element.\n\nLet's cut a long story short:\n\nThis game is neither good nor bad in my opinion but I will tend to NOT RECOMMEND it. I can't really describe how the fun I had turned into boredom, hate and in the end even a rage-uninstall.  I just want to let you know that this game isn't worth it's whole price and you should only get it when you're very very patient and have no problem with repetitive elements.\n\nAll in all:\n\n6.0/10.0","August 1, 2015","false","16.2"," 98 of 162 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","98","162","3","1"

The game really does have good graphics without being too demanding of your PC but lip sync does leave much to be desired. As a game it has done a great job of keeping suspense without losing its Alien feel even though I haven't encountered the Alien after playing the game for 1+/- hours. I still feel as though it is following me wherever I go and it may jump out at any moment but it doesnt, making me feel safe, but I am sure that when I least expect it, it will show itself.\n\nThe crafting system is really easy to use by clicking the materials needed to create the item then clicking a button to create it so you review what items you are using and won't accidentally create an item and lose a material you needed for something else.\nThe missions I have played so far are easy but a bit unclear as where to go, you have to check your map a bit too often but that may play a role in the game later. So it may be a bit hard for a person who doesn't play this type of game too often.\n\n(Tangable Review, may change over the course of playthrough).

It was meant as taking a break from development and maybe get inspired by.\n\nAt first I wasn't sure if my computer could run it, but here came the first surprise:\nThe game runs incredibly smooth whilst looking amazing. I haven't actually checked the my fps, but it felt like a solid 60 all the time, even at times with lots of particles, light effects and other stuff going on.\n\nThe attention to detail in the game is also amazing. The game took me about 16 hours to finish, and in that time I have taken a total of 638 screenshots. That means that on average I took one screenshot per 40 seconds.  The detail varies from smoke particles coming out of every door that opens, to lights that turn on when you enter a room.\n\nThe level design is also very clever and well done.\nAs a level designer when I saw this room: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=324571575\nI just stopped and looked in awe for about a minute. There is so much detail, but the lighting immediately shows where you have to go, the windows very nicely remind you that you're in space as well. The big sign still shows signs of a better past.\n\nThe gameplay is solid too, I'm personally not good at stealth games, but I still managed to beat the game on normal. The game is lengthy, but I feel that the pacing is pretty good. New things get brought in regularly, and generally after some very tense missions you'll have a bit of time to cool down again.\n\nA last thing that simply must be praised in this game is the sound design. Man oh man, the sound really, really gets you on edge. The first bit of the game there's not really anything to be actually scared of, but the music really keeps you sharp and scared.\n\nAll in all an amazing game, I'm already ready to vote this game my game of the year.\nThis game has inspired me more than any other game I've played. There's so much good stuff here I want to learn from and use in anything I work on in the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonSKennedy/recommended/214490/","NeonSKennedy","NeonSKennedy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NeonSKennedy/","629 products in account","Alien: Isolation is a very atmospheric game, with all the dim lights, steam, and busted pipes that should be expected. The gameplay could be described as a first person version of The Last of Us. You collect all these little pieces of junk used to craft items such as flares/flashbangs/medkits. You'll sneak around, killing unsuspecting looters, then you'll try and avoid the Alien, who reacts to sounds and is very much like a Clicker. You can throw flares just like bottles to create a distraction. One of my favorite ways to deal with hostiles is to throw a noisemaker so that the alien comes running, and takes them out for me. Things get very tense when you realize that you haven't save for almost 20 minutes and you're trying your hardest to stay alive. Running is a great way to get yourself killed because running is as loud as gunshots for whatever reason, I guess Ripley is wearing some squeaking clown boots. This is why I cannot compare it to Outlast, because in Outlast, you can ALWAYS run, you can outrun enemies and speed through the game. Here, in Alien: Isolation, that will not work. Running will attract the Alien and he is MUCH faster than you, so you have to think before you run in this game. Death is really frustrating, considering that the Alien could come from anywhere, sometimes he will grab you from a vent above, so it takes determination to get through the game, because you will die! A lot! Sometimes you can go through vents or floor panels that have blinky lights on them, some of which is required to go through in order to progress. And hallelujah! There is absolutely no annoying jump scares!\n\nLots of graphic options to select, but the game is very optimized and really should just be cranked all the way up. There is also a FOV slider!\n\nThere's no jump button, so you gotta walk around a pile of rubble instead of jumping over it.\n\nI'd say this is worthy of an 8.5/10","October 6, 2014","true","36.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","21","27","0","0"

The building of tension leading up to your first encounter with the Xenomorph is perfectly paced, and when you are finally pitted against it, having to work yourself through the maze of the Sevastopol station while listening to the Alien stalk you through air ducts is the closest youll ever come to living the movie. Even checking email on terminals is nerve-racking as at any moment it can pounce up behind you and skewer you with its tail like a shish-kebab.\n\nYet still, it all falls apart in the latter half as you are tasked with the same rote "puzzles" over an over again. Get to Point B. To do so, unlock this keypad with the code that sits in the terminal right next to it. Pull this lever. Turn this crank. Flip this switch. Hack this terminal. I sh*t you not when I tell you that most "boss fights" in this game consist of pulling levers and turning cranks. Yes, Amanda is a mechanic, I get it, But so was Clark in Dead space and his tasks weren't nearly as mind gratingly repetitive.\n\nThis is a LONG game. On average a play through will take 20h and you will enjoy about 10 of them. In the last half the game is reduced to a poor man's action game, the threat of the Alien reduced to a nuisance thanks to flame throwers. Similarly, synths are quickly dispatched with head-shots by boltgun or shotgun and humans are more effectively dealt with by clobbering with a wrench than any other weapon. None of the combat is tuned enough to be actual fun, much like the instructions to flip the next switch. Perhaps by design, as this is meant to be a stealth game but in the final third act the game does not seem to know whether it wants you to stealth it or shoot it by shoving weapons and ammo into your hands.\n\nBuy it in a sale or bundle, but know that this is really only recommendable for hardcore fans of the movies (which I am) and even so, its a stretch. More frustrating than fearsome, it feels too much like an opportunity wasted after such a great opening and initial half.\n\n6/10, tampering by Weyland-Yutani suspected.","January 8","false","22.2"," 79 of 131 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","79","131","8","12"

This is when I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nWell would you look at that. A game that carries the sole name Alien that actually lives up to what the original film did all those years ago. This is the best ALIEN game of all time without a single doubt in my mind\n\nAlien Isolation a game developed by Creative Assembly who were known for releasing the latest iteration of Total War in a horrendous state that nearly killed anything good surrounding that name\nWhy are you reading this review then? BUY THE GAME! No I’m serious, buy it now if you are a Alien or a fan of any stealth games like outlast or amnesia. So um buy the game?\nIf you are still reading then I would assume it’s because you would like to know what the game is and what I find good and bad in the game, with a recommendation of buy now, wait for a sale or skip completely\n\nYou take the role of Amanda Ripley the daughter of the female protagonist Ellen Ripley from Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection (But those last two movies never existed did they?)  15 years after the events of Alien that the flight recorder of the Nostromo who Ellen Ripley had previously been on has been found and a Weyland Yutani Executive Android by the name of Samuels has asked you if you would like to take the journey to the main location of the game called the Sevastopol station. Unfortunately being an Alien game these sort of things never stay easy.\nUpon arriving at the station you are told to back away and leave, ignoring the advice the station has relayed to you, you take the plunge and enter the station, this is where the proper game begins and I’ll stop here for any spoiler’s story wise.\n\nThis is where I have to briefly speak about one of the best parts of Alien Isolation which is the sound design and the atmosphere. These are two of the many things that the game completely succeeds and excels in. The sound of everything from the iconic motion tracker to the hissing of the alien and even to a degree the screams of her victims is exhilarating to hear. The sound will always keep you on your toe thanks to the extra effort Creative Assembly put into the game by having the original sound from original movie recorded and placed into the game which makes everything you see and do a treat. The atmosphere also needs a mention here, thanks to the brilliant lighting and placement of shadows everything feels ripped right out of an old horror movie and this does the game true justice as well. I could go on forever about the sound and atmosphere but I’ll leave it there\n\nThe next point I’ll make is the graphics. While they are not the best we have ever seen they do help create the mood and atmosphere of the game terrifically. This is done by the way the game uses Alien Low Sci fi. In which everything you see and interact with comes in mind from the original way we all imagined the future back when the Original Alien was released. The Low Sci fi is a particular high point as you see all those iconic ways people had imagined the future through lounges and spaceships, to suits and even hallways. This game simply has it all\n\nThis then brings me to the main part of the game, the enemy and the stealth. Now this is quite a varied opinion as I feel the Ai in this game for the Alien at least is by far some of the best AI I have ever encountered. The Alien is dynamic and it feels as if you are actually facing off against the Alien from the movie. This is an achievement in itself and its great knowing that its such a good game. So what about the other Ai? To be honest they are average, the humans range from dumb to amazing and the androids also unfortunately fare the same, that does not stop them from being scary though (shivers). The Androids act like robots as you would expect and as they chase you yelling “running is a safety hazard” and “I need to speak with you” Its funny and creepy at the same time.\n\nThe stealth in this game is very similar to the game outlast which funny enough came out not too long ago. You can walk and run as well as enter lockers to avoid detection, however you can’t open and close doors but you can activate a lockdown system which temporally locks the door, but they didn’t lock the vent above you mwahaha. Anyways to assist you with being stealthy you get a selection of tools that you can craft like a noise maker which attracts the enemy to a specific spot while for instance a Molotov will not only keep the alien away but set the humans and androids on fire as well. All these go on the mix with weapons such as the pistol, the shotgun, as well as the iconic flamethrower with one more which I shall not name.\n\nNow this brings me to the last point the collectables. Yes that’s right I need to talk about these because they have some of the best collectibles in any game ever, while some of the most boring and average ones yes. So firstly the bad ones, these involve having IDs for the games missing people, but with no story apart from a picture these just plainly suck. However the next set more then make up for it. So during the game you will get tools which can allow you to access locations that you previously couldn't explore such as a gas room for example. With these new tools you can go back and access them, these usually contain the Nostromo Logs which are voiced by the original cast members of Alien which provides extra juicy background information for the game which makes it a joy to listen to them all speaking again, including you ash!\n\nSo what does all this do in the end? Well we get a game which has an iconic setting that just begs to be explored Metroidvania style with fantastic collectibles for the most part. The smart and on your tail Alien that is relentless as well as creepy and a serviceable story which explores the gap we didn’t know much about\n\nSo my score for Alien Isolation is a Recommendation","April 28, 2015","true","22.4"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","7"

If you're a fan of the original film you'll find yourself in love with the way the game looks and feels. They got it right. No, they got it perfect. Lighting, steam and sounds that echo back to the 1979 classic and you get to live it. For me I was excited, we've seen enough games in the universe that follow the action side of Aliens but nothing quite like the horror and dread of the first film. You have it here. So far the best part for me was the pre-order Nostromo DLC; I was like a kid on Christmas when I played as Ripley on the Nostromo running through all of the steam-filled halls as the ship was about to explode. The nostalgia got me something fierce.\n\nAs for the main game, I've put about 4+ hours into it so far and I'm liking it. Everything feels like Alien, 1970's sci-fi with tube TVs which need to be tuned, bulky objects and tools turned weapons. Sevastopol feels warn out and lived in, and you're stuck in the aftermath of the events that took place prior to your arrival. It feels believable and it's interesting to explore and wonder how everything went to hell. There's also a certain beauty to it, colorful lights keep things interesting for the eyes but it's still bleak, objects are strewn about and some will rattle your nerves as you accidently kick physics enabled cans which rattle down hallways leaving you wondering "Did anything hear that?"\n\nSevastopol feels a lot like Dead Space 2's Sprawl station, if you've happened to play it you'll feel it's a bit familiar. The inhabitants of Sevastopol come in three flavors: humans, androids and the Alien. Encounters with humans tend to be Mexican stand-offs, allowing you to leave them be or having you try and take them out though several times I tried getting around a group and they opened fire on me regardless. The androids are properly creepy but are slow, only coming after you with a power-walk like pace and you can outrun and hide from them with ease but they take a beating to go down. As for the Alien, well, you're screwed. You can't outrun it and you'll have to use your tools and they environment to sneak by, only later will you get a flamethrower that will temporarily ward it off. You can build med-kits, pipebombs and noisemakers and there's also lockpicking mini-games, power panels and computer terminals to interact with. Don't worry, the mini-game isn't annoying a you'd probably think. One point in the game, which was a highlight for me, I was trapped in a room at the end of a hallway, the Alien was on patrol right outside coming to the room. I hit the emergency override on the door to keep it closed and used the Rewire panel in the room to trigger an alarm at the end of the hall to grab the Alien's attention. He ran to the end of the hall and I made my escape. It's really rewarding when you come out of encounters unscathed but when you don't, there's the biggest flaw the game has.\n\nThat same encounter didn't go so well the first time and cost me 20 minutes of gameplay. The saves weren't that far apart but they took place during an Alien encounter, so you have to be slow and methodical least you want to reload your game. The game uses save stations, there's no quick-save or checkpoints (unless it's the beginning of a mission), so from my initial save I spent 20 minutes creeping around, looting boxes and corpses for materials only to have it wiped away by an omnipotent Alien. That's one thing I hate about the Alien encounters, because there's only one and it's the star of the show they've made it so it's always a threat when it's around. That's good, but it's feels almost scripted and not natural. That encounter I talked about was essentially two large areas with halls and rooms to explore, you had to go from area A to area B and back through area A. How it went down was the Alien showed up in area A, I made it through to area B without making a sound but as soon as I made it there the Alien showed up and patrolled area B and never went back until I did. Because of this this small section took up a lot of time and at the very end, without making my presence known the Alien B-lined it for me and killed me, at this point I didn't have the flamethrower so I was as good as dead. Good show. Load save.\n\nTechnically I haven't had any issues, my GTX 780 is pushing 120 frames easy and has never dipped though if you turn off V-Sync you'll notice a lot of screen tearing during the prerendered cutscenes which there's a decent amount of. It's pretty annoying.\n\nUltimately it's hard to not recommend the game but I'm a total fan of the film, if you are too you probably already have it. Currently I'm 5 hours in and apparently that's a quarter of the way there, so there's a lot of value here. The DLC is great as well but if you've missed the boat for it you'll have to get the season pass and there's no release date for the Nostromo stuff yet. If you're on the edge and enjoy horror titles with a sci-fi flavor you'll enjoy Alien Isolation.","October 6, 2014","true","46.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","1"

Set around 15 years after the original film, it puts us in the shoes of Ellen Ripley's daughter, Amanda, seeking closure about her mother destiny's after she learns the Nostromo flight recorder was recovered.\n\nThis is practically my first experience with the Alien franchise, as I'll have to admit I've never seen an Alien film in its entirety, only parts of them (that's something I should fix ASAP); although I do know the plot of the first film. And I must say that if you're in the same situation as me, then this is a great opportunity to get into the franchise. The aesthethic is retro-futuristic; it seems they aimed to recapture the feeling of the original film, and they did a fantastic job; Sevastopol is an amazing space station, full of areas to explore, and to hide. As far as the soundtrack goes, it's excellent. It really sets the tone of tension during several moments.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, this isn't a run and gun. And this isn't a "hide in a corner and wait until the enemy goes away/learn the movement patters" stealth game. No, this is a stealth game about movement, survival, and adaptation. This game will punish you if you stick to the same tactics; the Alien will learn, and so you must learn as well. It's not just about hiding in a corner, it's about outsmarting a much stronger and faster enemy. And even then, the Alien isn't the only threat; there are other people on the station, who will do anything to survive; and then there's the Working Joes, those unsettling androids, who might not look like much of a threat with their slow movement, but can really take you by surprise.\n\nAt times, it might seem there are huge difficulty spikes, but this is not true; it's part of the challenge. Sometimes you'll find yourself stuck in an area, getting spotted and dying time and time again, and then, when you go back again, you'll find it wasn't as difficult as you originally thought; that happened to me several times. It's all about paying attention to your surroundings, and making the best use of the tools you have available.\n\nThe story, as I mentioned in the first paragraph, is about Amanda looking to get some closure on her mother's fate. When going to the station that was holding the Nostromo flight recorder, things aren't as smooth as they should, and soon you're trapped in this huge station with an Alien on your back. I don't want to give any more details, as something that adds to the experience are the surprises you'll find aboard Sevastopol.\n\nWell, I don't think there's much more to add. I could write a thousand more words, but I don't feel I would make this game any justice. It's just something that you need to experience by yourself.","January 2","true","21.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","3"

The lighting in the game is perfect and the Alien AI lets just say it's super smart. The first time I encountered it was in a vent of all places right before I was actually supposed to see it for the first time. Knowhere is safe no matter where you hide. I've died so many times from getting pulled out of lockers and storage cabinets just when I thought it would leave. However I figured out later on that you can hold your breath and lean to the back of the cabinet or locker if it senses you. You have to be really quick though and you can't be leaning back already which is most likely the reason I died so many times.\n\nThe Alien itself looks exactly like in the movie and is very unpredictable. You can hear it crawling through the vents above you. You never know when or which one it will come down from. It will hear you running, walking, or if you bump into things so you spend the majority of the game crouching and looking where you walk. If it sees you you can either scare it away with fire which will ♥♥♥♥ it off or it was nice knowing ya. It can't be killed. The sound effects and music are brilliant. They play just at the right moment and keep the atmosphere of the game tense.\n\nAside from the Alien itself there are other dangers like Androids and other humans. The humans are not much of a problem because you only have to lure the Alien to them (you probably know what happens next), but the Androids on the other hand are a problem because the Alien is not interested in them. Also the only time you can save in the game are at "Save Stations." When you die you'll start next the last one you were at. This can be frustrating because in some parts of the game you won't run into another save station for a good while. This along with backtracking through the same areas you've already been through in the second half of the game is quite rage inducing.\n\nFor this being Creative Assembly's first take on the survival horror genre I think they nailed it. They really did the movie honor and it seems they truly cared about the content that went into the game. This is the game that Aliens Colonial Marines wishes it was.","October 11, 2014","true","17.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/214490/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","There’s been hundreds of games inspired by the Alien movies. Going all the way back to Alien Breed on the Amiga, to more recent titles like System Shock and Dead Space. This means a ton of novelty value is lost in Alien Isolation before you even start it. Almost everything in the game will remind you not just of the movies, but the mountain of things it inspired.\n\nDespite all this I was pleasantly surprised by how effective this game is. At times it can feel like any other space horror game you’ve played before. But when the stars align it’s like you’re on the set of the movie. You’re transported to something that feels wholly owned by the game and movie alone. It’s thanks to a herculean effort by Creative Assembly to make sure that everything looks, sounds and feels exactly like it should, down to the smallest details. Like even the lens flares look just like they did in Alien. It had a distinctive style thanks to the lenses they used. All the big things, and the smaller subliminal things are here to make it feel just right. This is better than I ever dared hope an Alien game would ever be. Much of it is thanks to it being released today. It’s built with state of the art tech, on top of everything we’ve learned from horror and stealth games over the past 20 years. It’s of its time, in a good way.\n\nWhat hit me 10+ hours into the game was that while this has collectibles and achievements like any other AAA production, it doesn’t shove them in your face like I’m used to. The developers obviously took things like “tone” and “atmosphere” seriously. It’s a videogame, but it doesn’t feel the need to shove that in your face. It’s the subtle touches that achieve this feeling. Like how the waypoint arrow is part of the motion tracker, instead of having a dot in the game world. And how the mini-game interfaces look like designs that belong in the world. They’ve sacrificed just a bit of usability across the board for the sake of immersion. As a whole this pays off, even if it opens them up to players nitpicking every detail as being just a bit more of a pain in the ♥♥♥ than they’re used to. It’s about the big picture!\n\nAs a whole the game looks amazing. But there’s little issues here and there that prevent it from being perfect. The character models look good, in stills. The second they start talking they look more like mannequins than people. The animations can also flip out, with the alien making sudden sharp turns that take you out of the moment. Similarly the audio is outstanding, but with glaring issues here and there. At some sections of the map the audio disappears. Like you’ve wandered out of the sound and music propagation zones. It’s a rare problem, but it stands out, especially since it most of the time is one of the best sounding games of all time.\n\nThe greatest failing of the game is the story. The characters are all flat, and devoid of anything interesting at all. They’re inoffensive, but bland. You play Amanda Ripley, and while she does a lot of talking, she failed to create a firm image in my head of her character. Her motivation in the entire game fits in a single sentence and don’t deviate from that. She doesn’t have an arc, so you don’t feel like you get to go on a journey with her, where you end up somewhere different on the other side.\n\nThe story feels more like a series of objectives instead of an actual story. You don’t feel like it’s going anywhere, which makes it impossible to guess when it’s going to end. I’ve heard complaints that it “goes on forever”, and that’s a failing with the story. The actual process of playing it is fine! The environments and challenges keep things fresh all the way to the end. But because the story is vague about where it’s going and what you’re trying to achieve you can’t intuitively sense where you are in the story. On paper it has threads and subplots like any story should. But they’re all weak, and fail to make an impression. It feels diffuse. The story isn’t complete ♥♥♥♥, just a jumbled mess. Which I guess is a degree of ♥♥♥♥, just not on the absolute bottom end of the scale.\n\nAs with anything I can live with bad elements if the good outweighs it. And thankfully there’s a lot to like about Alien Isolation that makes it a no-brainer recommendation. The setting is super strong, it manages to come up with new scares even in later parts of the game, and most importantly it feels right. There were parts in the game where I experienced a level of stress I haven’t felt since the scariest parts of Amnesia. When Alien Isolation fires on all cylinders it’s the most effective “being chased by a murderer” simulator I can imagine ever being made. At those moments all the issues fade into the background and don’t matter so much anymore.","October 18, 2014","true","17.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","3"

(https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=324612199) Most of the models and textures are also amazing, I can't think of any specific examples but some smaller unimportant textures can be a crappy resolution but overall the graphics are fantastic.\n\nAtmosphere\nAs all horror games should have, Alien: Isolation has an amazing atmosphere, you have the classic pitch black rooms with a flickering light as the only source of light and well lit rooms. You can often see out of a window and see the true size of Sevastopol station. You can be a fairly dark area and have your motion sensor bleeping to inform you of the incoming Alien or the cold narration of the Working Joe's as you murder them and they just keep coming towards you. The game is very immersive with a fairly minimal HUD on the most difficulties. Overall an amazing aspect of the game.\n\nDifficulty\nThe difficulties are..\nNovice\nEasy\nMedium\nHard\nNightmare\nFor the most part they're self explanatory, novice is very easy and from there they get slightly harder with reduced items, harder hitting enemies and a smarter deadlier Alien. The only significant step up is Nightmare mode.. Nightmare mode is extremely difficult, here are the changes:\n\n- The motion tracker is broken\n--Distorted Signal (goes offline for a few seconds every 2 seconds)\n--Gives unreliable information\n\n- Authentic Flamethrower\n--Fuel burns faster (so you run out bloody fast)\n--Fuel is rare\n\n- Reduced Resources\n--No ammo drops from enemies\n--Fewer items to scavenge\n\n- Less game feedback\n--No health bar\n--No ammo counter\n--No flashlight indicator\n\n- More Dangerous Enemies\n--Androids are ~1 hit = RIP\n--Survivors will detect you easier and will often 1 hit you\n\n- More hostile environment\n--Map system offline\n--Harder hacking\n\n- Ultimate alien\n--More aggressive\n--Adapts faster\n--NO SECOND CHANCES\n\nIn nightmare mode you actually find yourself struggling to do an easy area on another difficulty eg. facehugger sections, since you have such little ammo. You also have to rely much more on stealth abilities and using the environment to your advantage. Getting caught by an android means certain death - which in the synthetic area where your weapons are removed is extremely difficult since you can't use the EMP bomb to stun them. During my playthrough I only ever had one stun baton so use that sparingly.\n\nStory Overview - Spoilers from here on in\nYou play as Amanda Ripley-McClaren, daughter of Ellen Ripley from the Alien film franchise. (Watch the first Alien film, for one it's a bloody good film and secondly, it's a little bit relevant to this game.. If you haven't seen it then prepare for a few spoilers..) Amanda was just ten years old when her mother disappeared following the loss of the Nostromo in deep space.\n\nNow for a quick refresher of what happened in the Alien film.. In 2122 the US Commercial starship Nostromo was summoned to LV-426, a desolate planetoid, where an unknown warning signal was being broadcast from The Derelict (The port prong on The Derelict measure 161.6 meters in length and the starboard prong 174.3 meters. The craft is 116.6 meters wide and 61.0 meters wide between the starboard and port prongs. Not essential to known, but a fun little fact.) - The company behind sending the USCSS Nostromo was Weyland-Yutani. The Nostromo's crew, including Ellen Ripley, investigate LV-426 to discover the remains of the ships pilot (An Engineer or 'Space Jockey' - which is a whole other topic, look into that for yourself) and also a large chamber filled with hundreds of egg like objects. One of the eggs open and a Face Hugger latches onto the face of a member of the crew, rendering him unconscious - the other members of the crew then proceed to break quarantine to bring him back aboard the Nostromo. The Facehugger cannot be removed once it has attached itself to its victim as it has acidic blood, preventing it from being cut off and any attempt to remove it with force causes it to tighten its grip around the victims neck. The facehugger supplies the victim with oxygen to keep them alive as it implants an egg, hence the victim becomes the host of a perfect killing machine. Once the egg is implanted the facehugger detaches and runs away, dying off. The crewman wakes up, seemingly fine, shortly after the Alien bursts out of his chest (chestburster phase) and runs off, it rapidly grows to ~8ft and begins murdering the crew. Ripley activates the self destruct sequence on the Nostromo and escapes to be put in hypersleep for 57 years, here Aliens begins.\n\nIn 2137 the flight recorder unit of the USCSS Nostromo was recovered and taken to Sevastopol Station, Ripley was informed of this by a Synthetic (I don't know if this is a spoiler, it isn't mentioned early game and theres no huge reveal, they're just like "he's a synth, but he isn't killing you, so have fun." Unless I'm stupid and missed something..) called Samuels, who is under the employ of Weyland-Yutani, Ripley is employed as an Engineer in the sector where the Nostromo was lost as she wanted answered to what had happened to her Mother. Ripley joined Samuels and the small Weyland-Yutani team being sent to recover the recorder from Sevastopol Station. Ripley and the team travel to Sevastopol on board Captain Verlaine's privately owned ship, The Torrens. When the arrived they discovered that communications with the station where scrambled and hence needed to board the station, with the docking facilities damaged Ripley, Samuels and Taylor, the Weyland-Yutani lawyer, attempted a spacewalk to the station but following an explosion and some falling space debris this failed and Ripley was separated from the other two.\n\nAfter some exploring you'll find the Maintenance Jack and then you'll meet a very friendly man called Axel, who is here as a tutorial as sorts - teaching you what a vent is, what a flash light is, what getting shot at is and what getting stabbed in the chest by an Alien looks like in a very beautiful cut scene looks like. When you eventually reach the Lorenz SysTech Spire you gain the .375 Revolver and the Security Access Tuner - the hacking tool of the game. From here the real game starts with frequent Alien attacks and various attacks by people and synthetics -you'll know when the Working Joe's become a hostile threat following the scene where it brutally murders another survivor called Hughes. However, not all Working Joe's are hostile, so be careful with which ones you attack.\n\nWeapons/Items/Inventory/Crafting\nWhat separates Alien Isolation from the other various Survival Horror games is the way it handles weapons(/items), generally the way these games work is they make you powerless so that hiding is the only option, but in Alien: Isolation you are given a vast array of weapons with a variety of different uses.\n\nStory Items\nMaintenance Jack\nMotion Detector\nAccess Tuner\nPlasma Torch + Upgrades\nWeapons\n.375 Revolver\nShotgun\nFlamethrower\nBolt Gun\nItems\nFlare\nNoisemaker\nSmoke Bomb\nFlashbang\nEMP Mine\nMolotov\nPipe Bomb\nMedkit\nStun Baton\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hit the word cap for reviews, so for the full review click here[pastebin.com]","June 3","true","49.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

But this is quite an easy statement for me to make, seeing as I’m such a fan of the first and second films. I really feel that this game redeemed the horrible Alien Colonial Marines even though it’s a significantly different genre. As a standalone game, Alien Isolation is a solid game.\n\nI love the game world, the eerie Sevastopol space station. The developers have put a lot of effort into creating a genuine retro-sci fi environment, with immaculate sound design to back it up. I was fully immersed while playing. The Alien and homicidal androids only added to this immersion thanks to brilliant animation work, and sophisticated AI. Open ended level design and brilliant realistic effects kept me wanting to explore and use my various gadgets/weapons.\n\nThe story is solid as well. All of the characters felt like different people, and it felt like a true continuation of the first film. There were many twists and moments where I was genuinely surprised. In my opinion, the game was a bit too long, and didn't need some sections, but it was great value for money. Rarely have I seen survival horror games with this much bang for your buck.\n\nThis felt like a complete experience from start to finish. Any fan of the first film will probably already own it, but even if you don’t know anything about it, this is a game you should not miss (unless horror isn't your thing). It’s stressful at times, but equally as rewarding.\n","October 14, 2014","true","22.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","3"

This of course results in an enormous amount of expectations in any new release, although high hopes have curtailed by the more recent failed creations of Alien games as well as movies.\n\nThis is where Alien: Isolation enters the equation, trying to clean up the mess by simply taking the franchise back to its roots . Gone are the times, when players could exterminate dozens of the species -which after all claims to be the perfect organism-within a matter of seconds. The audience is once more confronted by a truly deadly foe, treacherous synthetics and next to no means of effective personal defense. The IP has gone full circle, it would seem.\n\nTaking on the role of Amanda Ripley, you embark on your journey to recover the Nostromo’s flight recorder, and therefore the fate of your mother Ellen Ripley. This recovery operation leads you to the Sevastopol, a space station ready to be scraped for resources due to the corporate downfall of Weyland Yutani’s perhaps biggest competitor in space age technology.\n\n\nSound/VisualsThe universe created in 1979 is captivated in this game near perfect. The sounds as well as the visual design feel right out of the Alien movie, taking you back into the future how it was imagined in the 80’s. In a way it’s almost crazy how natural a green on black monitor feels in a space station set in 2137.\n\n\nGameplayThe general feel of the game can only be described as amazingly involving. Besides the map screen every action you take will not interrupt the game. Saving, inventory management, opening sealed doors with your laser cutter, crafting – everything is done while the game itself goes on. This also includes checking emails and voice recordings on the stations computer terminals. So if you’re trying to get every tidbit of background story like me, you’re in for some pretty tense situations. All of these actions demand for Ripley’s full attention, therefore limiting your view to the terminal, door or whatever you’re interacting with at giving moment, leaving you vulnerable from several angles.\n\nThe alien itself seems smart enough for the job and will hunt you fairly effective – given you keep the noise down. If you don’t, you’re dead in a matter of seconds. Through the progress of the game it will also adapt to the way you deal with it. For instance it will start to recognize the sound of your motion tracker if used near it. Too many noisemaker grenades and it will try to work out from where you threw it instead of inspecting the noise. If flames are your solution in fighting back it will recognize the weapon in your hand and try to charge and wound you instead of going into the vents immediately. By being this smart and deadly the alien has finally regained all the terror it lost in the previous installment of the franchise, leaving you scared and vulnerable in the dark corners of the Sevastopol. It has you fighting the instinct to just run in fear and instead carefully sneak away from it painfully slowly. And dear god you, if you ever cross paths with it in the confined spaces of the vast ventilation system.\n\nBy far the most intense moments are the early stage of the game, when you are equipped with barely anything, not even a motion tracker. Progressing through the game, you will be able to craft new ways of dealing with your enemy, but except for one item, you will never have the feeling of having an edge over the alien. This one item however changes the pace of the game so much, that I personally think including it was a mistake. It is the iconic flame thrower, and as long as you have fuel for it you can pretty much scare the alien away every time you encounter it, therefore introducing a feeling of safety which counteracts the game’s biggest strength – your vulnerability.\n\nOverall the game has a nice pace with enough alien stalking to keep the feeling of a permanent threat alive but also short passages when the action shifts away from the alien, giving you time to sort of relax and bolster up your courage for the alien encounters ahead of you.\n\nI’d recommend this game to anyone that wants to feel just as much fear as he felt when watching Alien for the first time in his childhood.","October 21, 2014","true","16.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

So much detail went into the look and feel of this game to thrust you into the Alien universe. I found myself holding my breath, gasping in surprise and fright during many points in the game. Alien: Isolation is a prime example of survival horror done right. The alien AI is amazing.. and persistent. Don't expect to make it through the game without dying. If you can.. bravo! Probably took you ALOT of time creeping and hiding most of the game. Which is awesome. This game ISN'T about guns blazing and running into the fray. It's about subterfuge, misdirection and lots of sneaking and hiding.\n\nThat's all the good (and there is LOTS of it). Now for the "bad" (if you can call it that).\n\nThere are many tight spots that can be infuriating. I can see why there is an achievement for 100 deaths to the alien. But everyone plays differently and some may find better ways out of sticky situations. I ran into some spots where I went through each type of crafted item trying to find a way to avoid an alien to re-power up a generator. Tried different routes. Different tactics. Hiding in vents. Using distractions. Ballsy hide and seek. Lots of reloads. Eventually.. luck won out. That's not necessarily a bad thing at all... like I said.. infuriating. But I did get to see Amanda dying about 7 different ways :P\n\nThe only real "bad" complaint would be the ending. It just felt rushed. Abrupt. Incomplete almost. If you follow the Aliens universe, we know Amanda's outcome from the Aliens (#2) movie.. so I don't know if the ending was just a little bit of a disappointment due to all the stress I went through most of the game and feeling a little denied that sweet release of a conclusive ending. Here's hoping for Alien: Isolation 2!\n\n================\nGraphics: 10  - Beautiful and faithful Alien universe recreation.\n\nSound/Music: 9 - Appropriate and necessary effects. Light on music for good reasons and tense when needed.\n\nGameplay: 9 - The controls took a little getting used to at the beginning. Nothing wrong with it tho. Especially when I played with Xbox360 controller.\n\nStory: 8/9 - The core story is actually AMAZING. My lower score here is that there's a few plot holes and couple deus ex machinas. Some parts of the story felt unresolved or brushed off since you spend most of your time in survival mode. To the point you don't care about some of the people along the way, which is sad. There's ALOT of lore in the game already and I felt sorry for some of the little "air time" given to some of the bit players along the way.\n================\nOVERALL SCORE: 9","July 27, 2015","true","36.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","2"

Play it to see it.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI will get the negatives out of the way.\n\nThere are several climactic moments in the game when you think the game is about to end, yet it doesn't. That doesn't mean I wanted the game to end necessarily, it's just that the amount of these climaxes diminished their effect gradually. Nonetheless, I have enjoyed them all.\n\nIt DID get tedious in the last 3-4 hours having to flip the switches and having to start the power there and there, having to look for key cards and having to constantly check the map to plot the route and then subsequently plan the escape route.

I was able to save most of them until my weapons were temporarily taken away.\n\nThe first 4-5 hours were kind of frustrating, insofar as hiding from the alien goes, but as soon as you figure out the amount of seconds you get on average when the radar blip moves away and as soon as you learn to differentiate when the alien is above you in the vent or on the other side of the door and as soon as you learn that sneaking constantly with the radar up is not really necessary and then you start getting a handle on this cat and mouse fight. Things get a LOT easier once you get the flamethrower about 6 hours in. Even on hard mode I never once came close to running out of flamethrower fluid. It does not kill the alien but small bursts of it do scare him away long enough for you to either find a way out, flip a switch, use a blow torch or what have you.\n\nClunky combat does get in the way at first but I have learned to deal with it. After a while it really was not a big deal.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs for the positives - too many too name, I am sure I will keep editing this review when more of them come to mind.\n\nWell, for starters, this is by far the best game by movie adaptation that I can think of. After I beat the game I have popped my blu ray version of the first Alien and could not believe just how accurate the game design is to that of the movie.\n\nI loved the graphics. They were pristine, crisp, shiny, realistic, polished. The smoke, the view of the cosmos, the creepy android design, the level design were all great. Lighting could use some work though.\n\nThe foes are tough to kill. Almost each one required a planned and careful approach.\n\nThe flashback scene to the distress beacon almost brought tears to my eyes. It was beautiful. It was nerve-racking. I have immediately started googling away for Prometheus 2.\n\nThe exploration requires thought and planning. Backtracking makes sense. The crafting will make encounters easier and the upgrades may yield access to new areas but that means that you may deal with the alien or other foes for a longer time instead of proceeding to the main objective.\n\nI liked playing as the protagonist. I really did like Ripley Jr.. She has her own inner thoughts, she has a body with legs (although I never saw her cast a shadow, nor did I see anyone else cast any shadows), she takes a while to run, to hide, to climb, she can hold her breath, she does get scared and startled, she does express her feelings constantly - that really doesn't happen in most games that are driven by silent protagonists. Creative Assembly learned plenty from Outlast (insofar as the realistic first person "human" control goes). She does not really grow as a character though. In the end we still know very little about her.\n\nThe game is long, like very long. If you play this game from start to finish by fully immersing yourself at night without playing any other game in the meantime then you are guaranteed to have a blast.\n\nWe really don't get nearly enough of amazing titles like this.\n","December 9, 2014","true","43.9"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","2"

I never felt safe no matter what. If i was on the computer terminal , I was nowhere near safe. If I tried to save the game, I kept looking right and left to make sure it was clear. But then again, who knows, you might have an alien tentacle pierced through your chest.\n\nAmanda Ripley has gone through way worse ♥♥♥♥ than her mother did, that I can be sure of, first hand experience. The developers do so well to recreate the old film's atmosphere by putting the player's in the shoes of the actual survivor. You are not safe.  You have to look behind your back every once in a while. You have to hide. You have to survive!\n\nSome complain about it's length but I think the length for a triple A game like this is done right. I've played 22 hours on Hard on the main campaign and it has been very challenging for me. While the DLC doesn't offer long content, it definitely satisfies your sadistic needs of being controlled by fear.\n\nIf you want the maximum experience, play this game with headphones on in a dark room, just like you would with other horror games. Only this time, the environment (and of course the alien) makes you jump.","October 6, 2014","true","38.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

I could see the revolver, I could kick it around, but I could not pick it up. Being a survival game, you would think my character would do just this, but no, it had to lay here, because I hadn't "discovered the gun yet". If they didn't want me to have a gun at this stage of the game, then don't give me mobs with guns.\nAbout 20 minutes later, I found a gun on a table that I was allowed to pick up....\n\nEventually you do encounter the Alien, and after that, it will never leave your side ever again. Like a crazy ex girlfriend. You're on a station with a lot of survivors. Everything from people sitting and sulking in a corner, to more heavily armed ones. However, mr. Alien only wants to follow Riply wherever she goes. It doesn't matter if you take trains, elevators, space shuttles, it's always there when the game loads.\n\nAnd this leads to the repetetivess of the game. Which basically boils down to:\n- Walk into new area\n- If alien drops down, crouch behind chair, wait for alien to go back into his ventilation shaft.\n- Continue walking\n- Repeat steps 2, 3 for as many times as it takes to get to your destination.\n- If alien sees you, and you do not have flamethrower, esc-load game. If you have flamethrower, do a couple of bursts to make the alien go back into his vent\n- Don't walk under vents, even if you are positive you spotted the alien 50m behind you 1 second ago, it can most certainly be in that vent right now.\n\n\nThere will be some areas where you have the alien and humans at the same time, however the alien will never actively hunt the other humans, unless it tries to find you, and runs into one of them.\n\nIf you are in an area where the alien is scripted out, it will of course never appear.\n\nIf you run into androids, and the alien is not around, just ignore them and outrun them for the most part.\n\nIn this sense the game is very very linear, and absolutely everything you do is scripted down to the smallest thing. The alien will either be there, and never leave. Or not be there, and never appear. It never "roams" the station. Either it's there, and you have to deal with it constantly, or it's never there.\n\n\nAs i mentioned above, the game can also be divided into pre and post flamethrower. Before the flamethrower, you're at the mercy of the alien. And especially in the med-bay map, you will have to come to terms with dying a lot. Just save as often as humanly possible, and esc-load if you are spotted.\nAfter the flame-thrower, just make the alien go back to his vent with flames, or if it's very obvious it's going away soon, just crouch behind a chair for a short while.\n\n\n*ending spoiler*\n\n\n\nAt the end of this game, I must say that beating at this game for 15 hours, left me feeling rather empty with the ending. Finally the station is coming apart, and I enter the ship again. Only to be faced with yet another alien, and just airlocked back into space where the game ends... I guess it's getting ready for a sequel, but for me, I wanted at least some sort of cutscene, some sort of conclusion. However, what I got was a few seconds of headlights.\n\n\n\nFinally I will say that, even though this game could have been so much better, if I were to give it a 1-10 rating, it would be approximately 4. It's not horrible, it's not completely broken, it's just wasted potential imo, and even though it frustrated me a lot, I still played it though. Something I wouldn't do if it was completely horrible :p","May 17, 2015","false","15.5"," 285 of 513 people (56%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","56","285","513","25","24"

Steam tells me that I have about 88 hours clocked on this game and I have completed all 50 of the achievements, so I should be able to write this with a fairly expansive overview.\n\nFans of survival horror are likely to enjoy this, but the people really in for a treat are fans of the original 1979 Ridley Scott film 'Alien'. On a visual level, this game is simply gorgeous. Every grimy aspect of the film's 'truckers in deep space' art and set design is faithfully recreated in painstaking detail. The retro fonts on the computers, the bulbous tubes and wires of the corridors, the flickering lights, the seeping mist from every crevice. It is stunning to behold for your first hour or so of gameplay before you are gripped with terror.\n\nLikewise, the sound design is impeccable. Monitor beeps, the sounds of doors opening and closing, echoes through the long corridors; these all combine to create a truly claustrophobic atmosphere. Many other aspects of the sound design are made to sound similar to the soon familiar sounds of the Alien creature itself, making you wonder if you simply are hearing things or about to have a sharp tail jam through your torso from behind you. Add this to the fact that Jerry Goldsmith's original haunting orchestral score is put to good use, and you have one bloody terrifying atmosphere.\n\nAnother big plus for the game is the Alien itself. It is actually scary once again, after a long period of simply being cannon fodder in more recent films and games like 'Aliens: Colonial Marines'. Much has been made of the Alien's AI, and this works massively in the game's favour. The unpredictablilty of the Alien makes a huge case for replayability and it never truly stops being terrifying. Even when you don't SEE the Alien, it is never truly out of your mind. You hear it rustling in the vents. Whilst creeping down a corridor, you notice with terror the slowly dripping saliva of the Alien from an overhead duct, waiting to pounce on you. The easier diifficulties go fairly gentle on the player, but hard difficulty is where this AI is shown at its best. Nowhere is truly safe and you genuinely feel as if you are being hunted.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws. The story, whilst still being gripping enough, will not come with any real suprises to fans familiar with the franchise. The game is also just a tad too long to fully sustain the neccessary terror for its material. It's the equivalent of if the original film had been 3 hours rather than 2; the audience would begin to shift a little in their seats, rather than being truly terrified for a solid entirety.\n\nRegardless of that however, this game has a unique sense of dread about it and is in many ways the game which Alien fans have been pining for. A fitting tribute to the horrors of the original film and scary in its own right and its own medium.\n","November 8, 2014","true","88.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of Alien/Aliens, and so far nobody has gotten it right in terms of how an Alien game should feel. Dead Space got close, but since it is merely inspired by Alien and not directly in the franchise, it didn't fill the need for a solid Alien video game experience. Alien: Isolation has nailed it. Never before have I felt so vulnerable in a game, so uncertain as to whether I really could keep it together enough to make it to the next checkpoint without mishap. From start to finish, I feared the Xenomorph and its keen, unpredictable intelligence. However, like Ripley in the first Alien film, my fear was soon balanced by the will to do what needed to be done, whatever the risk. I didn't become less afraid, but I did become more skillful at eluding it as time went on. However, when the creature outsmarted me or did something unexpected, that same vulnerable fear returned right up to the end credits. I strongly recommend this game. It's the best Alien experience created since the release of the first two films and stays true to what we love about them from start to finish.","October 31, 2014","true","22.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/recommended/214490/","rust_decay","raZe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rust_decay/","394 products in account","It's common knowledge that games based on movies are usually subpar. Most of the time, they are a mere afterthought and treated like just another merchandise item. Like a t-shirt or an action figure, more often than not, the movie game is mass-produced without love or dedication, severely hindered by budget and time restraints, usually selling through name recognition alone. Good ones are hard to find.\nIt doesn't really help that creating a game based on a popular movie seems even more difficult than simply trying to make a good game. The movie game will not only be judged by how great it plays, but also by how true it stays to the source material. Luckily, Alien: Isolation excels in that regard, making it one of the rare games living up to its movie license. However, when it comes to its merits as a game, finding words of praise seems slightly more difficult.\n\nAlien: Isolation follows the premise of pretty much every Alien movie in existence: A dimly lit space ship or space station,  a female character named "Ripley" and an eyeless beast with a phallic-shaped head mercilessly hunting her, relying on its speed or the moment of surprise in order to kill.\n\nEssentially, the player is as powerless as any human from the movie. Even though the game is first person, it is not necessarily a first person shooter. There are weapons, but even if ammo wasn't hard to come by, the guns either don't work on the alien or, in case of the flamethrower, they only scare it off momentarily. Outrunning the xenomorph is not an option since it is much faster than the player and running will attract its attention almost every time. Your best bet is to avoid the creature entirely or distract it so you can sneak by. Thankfully, Alien: Isolation's Ripley is an engineer with plenty of tools at her disposal. She can craft items that produce loud noises as a means of distraction, hack modules to use her environment to her advantage and even if worst comes to worst, she can always hide in a locker, provided that she's able to reach it unseen. When you break it down, Alien: Isolation is a glorified game of hide and seek.\n\nAn early concern was that the xenomorph would behave too forgiving, that its game counterpart wouldn't hunt as mercilessly as the source material suggests. To put that particular concern to rest: It is not the case. Quite the contrary, in fact. Even though the alien may appear sluggish sometimes, it's a formidable hunter and killer. Especially early in the game, attracting the xeno's attention is almost a guaranteed game over. The creature will spot you hidden under desks, in lockers, will pull you out of vent shafts or drop down on you from above. The flamethrower helps evening things out a bit, but you still have to be on your toes. There are very few brightly lit areas in the game and spotting the xeno in this constant near-darkness just in time is often difficult enough. The creature's in-game depiction does its movie counterpart justice. Maybe even a bit too much.\n\nAlien: Isolation is a horror game that creates tension by keeping the player as helpless as possible while letting him face an enemy that plays on some of the most basic human fears. The alien is supposed to be powerful and frightening and certainly acts that way in the game, but it loses much of its scare after dying to it too many times. Even when it's not actively looking for you, the xenomorph is constantly stalking you. Making your way through the station's system of narrow corridors, you can hear it moving in the vent shafts above you, never knowing when it will drop down and come for you. Or the alien will turn around and check out the same area three times in a row. When you're expected to look for a specific item in a new area, there's simply no time to scout the place or even read a short e-mail because the creature might attack again any moment. Sometimes mere 10 seconds lie between each attack. Some reviewers have described the alien's behavior as "unpredictable". I would call it "erratic".\nIt's incredibly unnerving and while the effect may be desired to some degree, it gets in the way of the actual game. As a player, you will most likely have the urge to explore or to learn more about the game's setting. Unfortunately, that kind of pressure is applied to you with almost everything you do. The alien is absolutely relentless, constantly harassing you, always lurking only a few steps away, so you will often opt to not explore at all.\n\nWhich is a shame because the environments practically scream to be explored. The art design is fantastic and has the movie's retro-future look down to a tee. Everything looks blocky and plastic; thick cables, flickering lights as well as CRTs are everywhere. Any fan would be pleased.\n\nThat is exactly what the game boils down to. Alien: Isolation is a fan pleaser that replicates some of the most defining aspects of the movie, sometimes by blatantly revisiting a location or a situation depicted in the film. It's fan wank, but it's highly potent fan wank and most likely what you expect from a game bearing the name "Alien", for better or worse. There's also a good game in here that blends well mechanically with the atmosphere it aims to create, although it might leave you frustrated at several occasions.","October 12, 2014","true","25.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","11"

After a while, it got even darker outside, and I was getting sick of watching cats get brutally murdered and rats explode, so I told him we should play Alien: Isolation. He was reluctant, refusing to play every time I asked. But after some convincing, he agreed to play.\n\nHe got the hang of the controls pretty quick, we were at the part where you get the Security Tuner and then have to get the Data Cell. I showed him the basics, and eventually we were able to get the Data Cell with little effort. But he heard what sounded like clicking, and I told him it was something in the room we were in, and he kept shouting, "NOPE, NOPE, NOPE! IT'S THE ALIEN!" After trying to calm him down, I gave up and just moved on with the game. Then the station was on lockdown. We calmly found a door that we now had access to thanks to the newly powered Security Tuner, and eventually, we found the button to stop the alarms.\n\nWe cheered and with no hesitation, hit that button and listened to the alarms turn off. Now we had to get back to the elevator we needed to go to to move on with the story. But, before we could even plan our way back, we heard noises. We saw what looked like goo on the ceiling, dripping down. The Sevastopol was always trying to scare us with these types of things. Alien: Isolation was actually pretty good at building suspense.\n\nBut then we realized that the Alien was coming down from the vent right in front of us.\n\n\n\nAlien: Isolation is so terrifying I couldn't help review it now. I reluctantly bought this game, due to me not having much of an interest in horror games and also the fact that Alien: Colonial Marines was a complete failure. To add on to that, I have seen the Alien movies and liked them, but I'm not a hardcore fan compared to other people who have played this game. But why did I still buy this game? That remains a mystery, but I don't even care anymore. I lost hope for 2014 after Destiny was considered a failure, but this game may have just made up for that.\n\nGraphics\nAlthough the graphics are gorgeous, I would prefer talking about what makes Alien: Isolation (besides you-know-who) so terrifying: The atmosphere. You have little help, there's a murderous alien on the loose, and you have to survive it in an abandoned space station. Everything fits with the mood perfectly, and flawlessly recreates what the movies were like. Plus, I like the 80's touch to the technology, which (again) flawlessly recreates the movies. It's easy to imagine what it's Sevastopol was like before the Alien attacked, which makes the space station even more nerve-racking. The writing on the wall makes the game mysterious and also give you a crave for lore, which I will discuss later on. The atmosphere is intense and suspense-building. Heck, I think it even makes Bioshock look bad!\n\nGameplay\nThe game is heavily relies on stealth to get around. Plus, with the Alien and more chasing you around, the game is very difficult. But it makes the experience even more dark, terrifying, and amazing. I did underrestimate the game a little, because I played Five Nights at Freddy's beforehand and wasn't impressed with the whole fear factor of the game. I regret that. Alien: Isolation has made me cower in fear to the mere appearance of the Alien. Speaking of which, the AI for the Alien has to be the best I've seen in years. It isn't cheap and how it'll instantly know if you're there, and it's definitely not dumb. Try and sprint around, I dare you. I haven't died to it yet, but I know I will soon, and when I do, I will scream uncontrollably and break my headphones, computer, and everything else near me. And I already know the death sequences because I watched many videos before playing, and every single time I watch them die, I jump and quickly stop the video. And although it does use the overused "you are defenseless" concept, it does arm you with a few weapons to defend yourself from others, but the Alien can't be killed and you'll have to try and flee/hide from it. One problem I had with the gameplay though is that there is too much backtracking. Every game has it's share of it, but Alien: Isolation took it a step too far and now I moan out of boredom when I notice I have to backtrack. But still, I haven't had this much fun with stealth since Metal Gear Solid 3. so that's a feat.\n\nStory\nThe story overall is somewhat interesting, but what makes it so good as the lore. Although the story mostly is "Get off the Sevastopol with your crew" and Amanda Ripley seems a bit one-dimensional for a protagonist, again, the lore is what makes the story so interesting. Read up on the terminals to learn about what happened to the Sevastopol, and from what I've read so far, curiosity is killing me as to what happens next. Not much else to say here, but if you want a game with an outstanding story, don't buy it unless you like lore.\n\nAudio\nThe audio is key to making Alien: Isolation this horrifying and scary. Like I stated in the story, "But he heard what sounded like clicking, and I told him it was something in the room we were in, and he kept shouting, 'NOPE, NOPE, NOPE! IT'S THE ALIEN!'" and he also paused the game after every little bit of sound. The game will strike fear into your heart right when you hear a bang from a vent or clicking from whatever. Although the voice actors lack emotion when they talk, the sound effects and "music" set the mood. The random chords, the repeated pangs and bangs from the vent... Now do I get an excuse for the nightmares I've had from this terrifying masterpiece?\n\nReplayability\nThere isn't much replayabilty, but that's fine. The game is about 14 hours from what I've seen, and there's also a "Survivor Mode", which I want to try out sometime. It's hard to get in more detail than that with the replayability, unfortunately.\n\nVerdict\nAlien: Isolation will give you nightmares, heart attacks, and the assumption the Alien is crawling in a vent inside your home. But who cares? The game is well worth it, and is one of the best of the year. Pick this up if you love horror games or the Alien series, you'll be satisisfied, no doubt!\n\nGraphics- 10/10\nGameplay- 8.5/10\nStory- 7.0/10\nAudio- 9.5/10\nReplayability- 5.0/10\n\n**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**\n\n.:9.3/10:.\n\n+Brilliant Alien AI\n+Outstanding sound effects\n+Lots of lore\n+Immersive (and scary) atmosphere\n+Great stealth gameplay\n+The Alien is extremely scary\n\n-One dimensional voice acting and characters\n-Too much backtracking","January 3, 2015","true","7.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

Played the game during nightime only with headphones on, pitch black room, solo. Played through it in two long sittings. I'll play the rest of the content and update accordingly.\n\nPros\n\n1) Incredible atmosphere\n\n2) Stunning sound design and visuals faithfull to the source material; manage to capture the film's essence down to the core. That is due to both the impeccable art design and the astonishing gfx.\n\n3) Tech is not only impressive but scales incredibly well on low-end machines. Managed to run the game at a respectable 40+ fps on a laptop with a gt740m, i7-3630qm, 4gb ram with most settings maxed at native res. Played through the game on my main system (gtx670 jetstream 2gb vram, 3770k, 8 gb ram @ 2133 mhz) with everything maxed out at 80+ fps at all times. The game felt very fluid while looking breathtaking.\n\n4) Gameplay offers freedom to tackle encounters as you see fit; you can stealth and try to distract opponents, try to "muscle" your way through certain points, fight back or flee .\n\n5) Crafting and salvaging materials manages to cement that sense of gameplay freedom allthewhile separating this title\nfrom standard gameplay conventions found in the genre.\n\n6) While the alien is undoubtably the main attraction, all the other hazards that you have to face manage to be\nequally menacing and disturbing for their own reasons without them feeling "tacked-on" or out of place.\n\n7) The game manages to be very intense without relying on scripted events or jumpscares.\n\n8) Another triumph, in my book at least, was how the game made me undergo the same transformation that Ripley's character went through in the original film. From feeling terrorized and helpless to feeling empowered and determined while maintaining the predator-prey relationship all the way through. Even when i had all the right tools at my disposal due to my exploring and frugal use of equipment, i was always on my toes and facing danger always felt like playing with fire.\n\n9) While the Alien certainly felt like it had a certain bias towards me it did not ignore other stimuli\nand responded accordingly in different situations making the eco-system in the Sevastopol believable.\n\n10) The dynamic environment adds tons to the game's thick, opressive and suffocating atmosphere with visual and aural feedback accompanying your each and every move. Unwanted noise is created with your every step; doors and vents open automatically from a believable distance. A distance that would make sense for use under normal circumstances becomes a liability and a trap under the conditions that you have to face. Your surroundings are always a factor and may prove to be either an ally or a foe. This dynamism adds perpective and manages to offer full body awareness, immersing me completely in the protaginist's role.\n\n11) Voice over is spot on and true to the spirit of the source material.\n\n12) Map design is incredible with complex levels strewn with shortcuts that can be accessed straightaway or\nby the use of upgraded tools that you find through the game. The "metroidvania" aspect of unlocking certain\nsegments with upgrades is present and you are free to revisit areas, within narrative constraints,  disregarding your main objective if you choose to.\n\n13) Exploration comes at a price. You can either focus on the main objective and do the barely minimum to advance or\nchoose to snoop arround searching for info or materials/equipment at the cost of putting yourself at an even greater risk.\n\n14) The excellent design choice for your character to not be invulnerable while interacting with terminals or even when saving the game gives this constant sense of tension and dread.\n\nCons\n\n1) Epilogue (ch 18) feels too conventional and in contrast to what the rest of the game manages to achieve.\n\n2) Shadow aliasing adds "noise" to otherwise immaculately crafted visuals.\n\n3) Cutscenes, while very detailed felt choppy.\n\n4) Lipsync is off. Not hilariously bad but noticeable.\n\nNeutral\n\nThe game is lengthy. Chapters 15-18 felt like the equivalent of an "extended director's cut" film.\n\nAll in all, best Alien game i've played. Undoubtedly one of the best in the Alien(s) franchise and certainly one of the GOTY for me.","October 14, 2014","true","21.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","5"

I am replaying it now, to evaluate if it's going to be #1 or just among the top 5.\n\nAs most are aware, some reviewers have given the game lower scores and critizise its length (20h), repetition, save system and backtracking. Which is funny, because many of them play the same strategy games, the same FPS, on the same maps, and play the same MMO over and over, for hundreds of hours for years. And are used to respawning far away. They also complain they died a hundred times. On my first playthrough, I died 4 times. Once from a vent above (not paying attention to the drool), once in a cabinet (not leaning back/holding breath), once while opening a door without checking the motion sensor first (it was just right outside) and once by bad luck (it dropped down right in front of me while I had Synths after me).\n\nSo, for a 10/10 score (or enjoying the game immensely), you need to approach the game correctly. Running around with your gun out is not the way to go. Running ever is not the way to go. Playing in a lit room with only stereo sound during the day with kids and wife around (or siblings/mother) should be forbidden. It's a "first person stealth horror/survival game". I would describe it as a "first person stealth horror/survival STRATEGY game". You need to savour every moment still alive. Play slowly, one level at a time, even if it takes an hour. Save as often as you can (if you dare).\n\nYou also need a good sound setup, no other game have relied on surround sound as much as Alien Isolation. If you can't hear the true direction of sounds (as you often will be in the dark), you will die. If you don't pay 100% attention to the game at all times, you will die. If you rush it, you will die. If you get confident, you will die.\n\nWhat you need.\n- One very dark room.\n- Peace and quiet for at least an hour.\n- Surround sound.\n- Patience.\n- Nerves.\n\nIf you treat the game right, it will give in return,","October 21, 2014","true","239.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

If you like Alien and Alien 3 movies, you'll like this game.  Isolation uses a lot of original sound effects and parts of OST from the first movie.  The game also looks good and runs surprisingly well on older hardware.  I use GTX 570, 8GM of RAM, 3-year old i7 and the game runs at 60FPS on ultra.  Gamepad fully supported and I prefer using it over usual keyboard and mouse because you can perform smooth peaking around the corners.  In case of PC there is no middle ground, your character peaks or she doesn't.

R. Giger's world of Alien!\n\n(No excuses for TLDR, this is an indepth and well worded review of the game)\n\n(With only a few hours of gametime, I personally was scepticle to review this game, however I would like to upon the great enjoyment I'm having so far.)\n\nFirstly, it's clear to say this is definitely a more thrilling and money-worthy game than Aliens: Colonial Marines. The game promises the real fear and intensity of facing the incredible and ferocious Xenomorph and portrays the alien in a much more darkening light. Most previous games that feature the Xeno's are all about killing masses of them whilst not really being that scary. Alien: Isolation turns this around and instead of gunning these creatures down - you're really wanting to stay as far away from them as possible.\n\nThe gameplay evens out nicely, whilst it's not too challenging, it's also not a walk in the park. There are different routes around specific areas, a plethora or opportunities and items to accumilate or interact with along your way. You can make items such as the Smoke Bomb, or Noise Maker to use as a distraction - but make haste - for your decisions will surely need to be quick, careful and precise. There are weapons in this game too, however, they way you want to use them is entirely upon you - just be catious, guns make noise... and noise attracts unwanted attention...\n\nThe atmosphere is well done. Whilst arguably it may not be 100% perfect, it's definitley as good as the orginal Alien movie and suits well to the game. You'll find a lot of dark areas that will make you reluctant to traverse through as well as noises, such as engines or the humming and odd beeping of machines that may make you stop and listen. The atmosphere can often trick you into thinking there's something around, sometimes it's not the case but... be cautious!\n\nOther than just the game itself, there's some great and nifty little features. The map and menu systems are nicely done, with the poor quality of 80's styled computers, paying real homage to the original Alien film. There are collectables too which gives you more reason to have a good explore around and keep an eye out for items you can use as well as these collectibles. There are many interactable objects that can be rather fascinating and you can even use to your ability to aid you in the environment you're in.\n\nNone the less, this is definitely a game that most fans of the Alien saga should check out and even try. There's an amazing amount of detail and it's clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into this game, especially so with the help and insight of the original movie cast. Fans will be immersed into this incredible and gripping game and it's fantastic ways and familiarities to the classic film back in the day.\n\nI recommend this game to fans alike as well as people who enjoy a good immersive horror survival! - 8/10","October 6, 2014","true","12.8"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

Even the small hiss of the alien makes me stop in real life and then the reaction carries on to the game. It sends fear through me at all times! The alien is very smart and is really not the type of AI to be messed with. This truly is the Alien game we have always wanted. The enviornment of the game suits the Alien more than it suits us so I really felt that I was trespassing on it's territory the entire time and I had to choose every action wisely. Even the slight bump against the wall of your player can get you killed. Never have I felt so scared in a video and there is nothing better than for it to feature the classic Alien from the movies. Well done SEGA and CA you really have done it this time!\n\n(Update)  Now that ive p-layed more into the campaign and survivor mode ive realised that this really is an amazing game. It makes you lean round every corner your passing in-game by physically doing it in real life lol! Although I agree with most people about the lip sync on characters but that dosen't stop me from continuing this game.

Those of you that are old enough to remember are probably hitting up youtube for a refresher right about now....\nThis is less of a review and more of a testament. A simple 33 year old gamer bearing witness to arguably the most immersive video game ever created. If you are an ALIEN/ALIENS or even and ALIEN 3 fan as I am then you owe it to yourself to play this.\n\nFew games cause the anxiety this game produces. The sound of that Alien stomping around or your motion tracker suddenly springing to life when you thought you were alone is enough to make anyones nerves shred. The sound design is the BEST, not doubt about it. Not since Dead Space has the enviroment been so fear compelling as to what I was hearing around me.\n\nGraphically, well.... You might never see another game with this much detail, love and devotion put into it. The developer clearly used every bit of the ALIEN license and created something to behold. I find myself getting lost in the ship just looking around. From the floors reflections and the gleam off of the '70s scifi' computers to the basic look of the Alien. EVERYTHING is polished and well thought out. If your computer can run it youll have nothing but a 60 FPS locked with never a dip. I have been floored by some of what I see outside of the windows and down some halls. It really is a work of art.\n\nThe tension is palatable with Alien Islolation. Even saving the game is stressful for you must wait 5 seconds for the 'system to boot'. Leaving you totally open to attack. Aside from the Alien you will contend with other people, some good, most bad. Most looking to kill you or even try and eat you. (from what I have heard while crawling through the duct system.) Also the freakiest Androids you've seen. Their dead stare and bizarre rantings coupled with enormus power and a lack of compassion really make for a lesson in futility if you come up against more than one.\n\nSo in short, if you like feeling out numbered, vulnerable and almost helpless against a tyraid of monsters from all corners of a massive space station. Get. This.Game. This is probably MY personal Game of the Year. I will remember and probably replay this in years to come.","November 2, 2014","true","21.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","2"

Now I'm digging into it to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nThis game is likely the only game in the licensed Alien game lineup that accurately portrays the vision of the film; the first (and best) film, released in 1979. It creates an enveloping abmience, with its music, sounds and visuals, along with the story. I haven't yet finished the game but I am pretty far in - chapter 11.\n\nWhat I will say is that this game ramps up in a solid way - there are some parts that annoyed me with the Alien AI being almost *too* knowning but perhaps that is better than it being too easy.\n\nSome parts of the game are reminding me a bit of Bioshock in outerspace, which is not a bad thing, but just a vibe I'm getting at this stage in the game.\n\nOverall a really solid experience. Not as tense as Outlast or Amnesia, which is a nice change of pace.

It is fun, it is a different experience from loading the shotgun and blasting creatures apart *BUT* after awhile it does get a little tiresome constantly creeping, hiding, and repeating. So, my word of advice is experiment. You are gonna die no ifs ands or buts about it so don't obsess over making it through unscathed cause it ain't happenin'! So, to spice it up, try things you are unsure about. I tried sneaking up on the Alien, which can be done, although sometimes he pulls a crazy Ivan and turns right into your face and then it's game over, man... game over. Another time I saw the Alien crawling over some tanks and I shot the tanks and they exploded blowing him accross the room and he jumped up and flew up a vent a stayed away for probably 30 seconds or so, which in this game is an eternity. And lastly, take the game in small bites. I found that after playing for a few hours one day that I was tiring of the game and its paces so it's best to play maybe a level a day or so, and come back to it later to avoid fatigue. I have invested 14 hours so far and am on level 5! But, I die alot and play around in the environment a lot too, looking for hidden knick knacks and what not. I wonder now that this type of game has been successfully made how long will it be before we see a similar game with a Jason or Michael or Freddy filling the role of the Alien and hunting down accross wooded levels, and dark houses on city streets and abandoned schools?

The Sevastopol is designed with such high attention to detail, it's simply ridiculous. You can tell developers love the alien franchise because they nailed it perfectly. I've explored each corner of that huge space station and trust me I'll do it again in my next playthrough.\n\n[You're becoming hysterical]\n\nFear. It's present throughout the entire game thanks to amazing atmosphere, lighting effects, sound and of course the main star of this show - the Alien. This creature is unpredictable, it can go anywhere, it can randomly start running in any direction, it can hear you miles away and it will punish you for every single mistake you'll make. This makes the game so tense that I found myself crawling all the way through because I was afraid to walk, let alone run! The Xenomorph can catch you off guard anywhere, at any given time. On top of that, unlike many other horror games, in which the main baddy is a pushover (you can run away from him), the Alien Isolation's main "antagonist" is lethal.\n\n[You can't outrun the Alien]\n\nYou don't have an enormous arsenal, but it's enough to deal with working joes and scare off the alien. You'll use molotovs, flashbangs, emp grenades, flares, flamethrower, pistol, shotgun and some other things. You can't kill the Alien but this is a good thing to me.\n\n[You're testing my patience]\n\nSince my review is not fresh and I've heard a lot of opinions and reviews, I gotta mention that people dislike backtracking, because in the later stages of the game you will come back where you've already been in the beginning but please don't get mislead, because you will get an equipment which allows you to get to the sections which were sealed off and you won't spend too much time going through the same areas at all.\n\n[Are you quite finished?]\n\nThe story in this game is just... good. It probably could've been better but I personally don't mind it this way, I accept it. The only thing I kinda disliked is the cliffhanger ending. I don't mind the fact they let you know, Alien will have a sequel, but I also want a proper closure to the game.\n\n[The verdict]\n\nI'm a huge fan of the alien movies, games and their universe that I can't help but to rate it a 9.5/10.\nIt's an excellent game and a great opening to hopefully another great alien game series.","September 5, 2015","true","17.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Sega finally managing to get someone do the franchise justice? The world can still pleasantly surprise us, it seems.\n\nThis is a brilliant game based on the first Alien film and when I say based, I mean it brilliantly pays homage to it. While it doesn't take place on the Nostromo, in fact it takes place 15 years after the destruction of the ship, it recreates the look of that late 70's/early 80's sci-fi technology perfectly with the lovingly crafted enviroments that are joy to explore. That game also succeeds in making the Alien horrifying, at least for the initial encounters. As the game progressed, I found myself becoming increasingly jaded and less scared. However, it almost seems like that the developers anticipated this reaction and fit it into the narrative. You are given ways to deal with the creature and other threats futher into the game, so you will have more straightforward options than just hiding. It's like you follow the main character's, Amanda's growth as she learns to deal with the problems instead of running from them. The story is fairly well paced. It spends time to build suspense, as a proper horror story should. After a particularly terrifying section you are usually given few more peaceful sections to calm down before it amps up the horror again. The familiar tropes of the Alien films are respected. It felt like it dragged on at some parts, but in the hindsight I don't think it was too long. Took me about 15 hours to finish it on hard.\n\nThe controls are pretty good. Slight clunkiness maybe, but it fits the horror theme as well as the zeerust look of the enviroment. Amanda is no space marine trained to fast draw and aim her weapon in an instant. One minor annoyance is that sometimes the things you are supposed to interact with can be hard to find. It may be the kind of keyboard or screen that was part of the scenery in the previous areas and now is an object to interact with. Our game conditioned brains have trouble dealing with that especially when simultaneously trying to hide from the black horror of our nightmares that will instantly kill us if it sees us.","October 22, 2015","true","16.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

(I've not looked for a way to rebind though actually)\n\nPerformance 9/10 As I haven't really tried on max graphics as of yet and only playing with high at the moment and performance will vary between systems.\n\nThis review is as of 6/10/14","October 6, 2014","true","24.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Takes place on Sevastapol Station a place torn apart by aliens and synthetic androids, much like the city its named after in Crimea being torn apart by Russians or Ukrainans, though which side are the evil aliens, hmmmm....\n\nThe interiors feel like their right out of the movie with incredible attention to detail to the smallest things from the food trays to the walls and sounds.  Aliens Colonial Marines practically destroyed the reputation of Aliens in Gaming, but this game shows when your in space noone can hear you scream.  The graphics are amazing, its one of the first games that really gets the look right, everything is highly detailed, EVERYTHING!\n\nThis game is Sigourney Weaver approved, because its a story that makes sense, unlike Aliens Colonial Marines which was a COD clone in space.  Read more here: http://www.polygon.com/2014/10/7/6936885/sigourney-weaver-alien-isolation\n\nThings that kept it from a 10/10\n-The audio is just as annoying as horror movies in the theater.  At times the game is quiet then with no warning the game will blow your speakers making your ears bleed.  Theres no way to fix this so the dialog audio and the SCREECHING super loud audio are equal.  So you just play missing most of the dialog at times.\n-Suffers from the same problem as DOOM, no flashlight on any of the guns.... at least when they reboot this or maybe as DLC they can sell a Duct Tape mod like DOOM BFG had.\n-The Map sucks, probably the worst map ever made.\n-the biggest reason:  LENS FLARE!  Looks like it was put into the game by an 12 year old making an edgy image using photoshop or adobe premier.  Lens flare isnt created by just lights flashing, look out the window at night at cars or windows they dont create lens flare, that is from the refraction of light through glass.  Without looking through glass or someother translucent substance the only way to see lens flare with the naked eye is if you squint your eyes real hard until they water can humans even remotely see lens flare with the naked eye.  Hollywood been goofing with this too lately ever since it got added to their post production suites, so its kinda meh, but is annoying with no way to turn it off.\n\nRating 9/10  Value:  $24.99\n*Would be higher if it included all the DLC and stuff.  Without the DLC its just an Alien Avoidance simulator.","January 6, 2015","true","35.2"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

Everything is almost perfect about it. the 80s style atmosphere, the story, the suspense, the characters. We know the story, blah,blah,blah! Amanda goes to find the whereabouts of her mother when things go wrong. Suddenly you're trying to survive from other survivors to maddening androids that wanna talk about saftey while choking the life out of you. And the Alien. I must say, CA did awesome on the alien. It stalks you, it scares you, it helps you when you are in a fight with other survivors by killing them all then coming back after you. The music matches the suspense as you hide in a locker or storage bin as the alien looms closer to you. What i love about it the most is how it reacts to you when you pull out the flamethrower. It runs full speed then raises it's arm and hissing in defiance as you taunt it by firing at it. Now people say the alien is OP because its faster than you, has better senses than the humans/ androids, and cannot be killed. It is a perfect organism as Ash explained. Plus, you're a civilian engineer, not a marine, not Ellen Ripley, and not a Predator. And perhaps the guns at that time wasn't able to handle a xenomorph(remember Aliens took place 57 years after Alien).\n\nThe Crew Expendable DLC is nice, but short. You can pick Dallas, Parker, or Ripley. I guess Lambert was out because you would probably hear her complain all over the place. Ash is still a ♥♥♥♥ in the game. The airshaft part is scary because you hear the sounds of the alien coming at you but you don't know where and when, along with Lambert giving you the directions and panicking.\n\nThe only complaint is no multiplayer. I would have loved to see that. I mean like 3 people trying to escape and 1 person playing as the alien trying to kill the other 3. as for the 3 people: 1 could be a tracker, holding the tracking device to see where the alien is gonna come. Another can be the bruiser or assault, having guns and such to fight off other survivors or andriods. And the engineer, the person that can hack/break through the doors equipped with the flamethrower and craft stuff to give to the other 3 survivors. That is just my idea.\n\nI highly recommend it to alien fans and survivor horror fans. Personally, ignore the negativity that say its overhyped or bad, whatever. We have not had a good Aliens game since AVP 2 and that was 12 years ago(well there was that one for DS. Pretty neat game.).  Aliens:Colonial Marines wasn't only a giant disappointment, but a insult to every alien fan. Im very curious about the other dlcs. will we play as newt as she try to survives against the aliens in lv-426? A what if scenario where amanda and ellen ripley meet? Or a dlc where we play as the alien itself?","October 6, 2014","true","21.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

The first couple of hours have been like walking around the original films sets. Yes, the visuals are that good for the environments. As for the star of the show, the Xenomorph? Well, brutal is the word I'd use to describe it. It can access any part of the map you can and more you can't. It can lunge from ceiling vents and drag you in when your not paying attention to your surroundings and it's fast. It will kill you. A lot. All while looking amazing.\nParts of the game have literally had me breathless with the care CA have taken to craft this game and make it fit into the series lore. One section about midway in particular was one of the best experiences I've ever had in a videogame.\nI've finished the game now and have experienced none of the fatigue the few negative reviews speak of. In fact by playing in short bursts over the course of a week I was actually left wanting more. If you're a fan of the series or first film in particular, take your time, soak in the atmosphere and take in the amazing replication of the world of the movie.

I loved the story, the characters, and hid in fear from the alien.  Its well done and a unique mix of stealth and action, but I felt it leaned a lot of stealthy attempts to get past the alien, failing, and retrying - over and over again. :(  The lack of save points was a real challenge too. It definitely had a level of difficulty I wasn't expecting!  But it was all totally rewarding and worthwhile.  For some parts I had to turn the difficulty way down, which made it a bit more enjoyable as the alien wasn't completely on my butt the whole time.\n\nThe big pros are the story.  It just felt like a fell written sequel and I loved the characters, especially the female characters who were three dimensional instead of game stereotype bimbos or damsels.\n\nMy only real complaint is that a lot of the missions end with false endings.  You think you can finally leave and then something happens that leads you into the next mission.  It got kinda tiresome.  I guess it added drama but after the 5th time, it was just expected.","January 25, 2015","true","25.5"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

On the one hand I think that they have masterfully caught the atmosphere and feeling of the first Alien movie completely and just walking around and feeling that you actually are in that world is amazing to say the least. The environments are gorgeous late 70's sci-fi with analog computers and claustrophobic hallways. I absolutely loved it. But on the other hand, the gameplay gets really tedious really fast and I easily spent the last 6 hours of the game being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at it not ending. To say that it overstays its welcome is a massive understatement and it ended up being almost 3 times as long as I feel it should have been. I completed the game in little over 17 hours and of those 17 hours I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3. Then the Alien showed up.\n\nI know it's kinda weird to say this but the Alien actually ruined the game experience for me. When it first shows up it's fricking amazing, awful, horrible all those things you want to feel when playing a horror game, but that quickly took a turn for the worse when the damn thing won't ever leave you alone again. After it is first introduced, you can't take two steps without the damn thing jumping out of a vent between you and where you need to go fetch something to open a door somewhere and quite frankly, that's not scary. It's tedious, dull and serves no other purpose than to make you sit in a damn locker for 10 minutes while it circles the table infront of it. Being pretty much completely unable to progress due to it blocking your path at every single turn sucked the joy and fear right out of the game and left some kind of boring as hell hide and seek game. And once I pained myself through all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because I wanted to see how the story would unfold, I did enjoy that part, and finally got to what I thought was the end after 7-8 hours and thought to myself that okay, it wasn't THAT bad, the game promptly slapped me in the face and pointed to the remaining HALF of the damn thing. Seriously. It. Never. Ends. And that is not a good thing.\n\nAt the halfway mark, you're pretty much space Rambo with the entire arsenal you've managed to scrape together which completely strips away any notion of vulnerability you might have had earlier and you can just go and blast your way through any and all things that stand between you and your current objective, and correct me if I'm wrong, but that is not how a horror game should behave.\n\nIn the end I spent the final 4 hours of the game being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at it for not ending when it had so many opportunities to do so. It just wasn't any fun. But I'm unfortunately a completionist and I was going to see the ending, despite how bad the actual game was at that point.\n\nSo finally, do I recommend the game? Both yes and no. If you like the Alien movies and want to experience that great atmosphere in a game then yes, you should check this out and play the first 4 hours. But if you want an actually good game then no, you should not play this because the gameplay behind the awesome setting is boring, uninspired and downright tedious. As an overall experience I cannot recommend this.","June 6, 2015","false","18.2"," 115 of 207 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","115","207","10","8"

If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!\n\nGeneral GameplayAlien: Isolation is a stealth-based horror game.  In trying to work your way through the game's objectives, it forces you to balance running away from enemies with trying not to attract the alien by making so much noise.\n\nFrom the beginning, this game plays with light and shadow to make the environment very tense.  For HoH gamers, the game adds to tension with sounds designed to make you question how safe you are.\n\nThere are slightly creative solutions for getting past evil robots and other challenges, but once they see you, the AI gets a little weird and they just hang out for you to come out of hiding.\n\nWhether deaf, hoh, or hearing, if you are a fan of psychological horror, this game will definitely deliver.\n\nRated 7 because of occasionally silly AI and occasional lack of clarity of mission objectives.  (This crosses the line a little between "the gamer can figure it out" and "we just won't help you at all")\n\nDeaf/hoh gamers, be sure to read below.\n\nReplayability\nA:I seems like a relatively scripted game, so it is may be very similar from one play to the next.  Still, it is challenging enough as it is, so may be worth the challenge on a second game at a higher difficulty.\n\nGeneral Accessibility\nAccessibility Options\n- You CAN edit options before going in to the game.\n- Gamers with mobility issues can rebind keys to accomodate needs.  "Peek" and "Reload" must be held rather than toggled, so keep that in mind.\n- HoH gamers can change sound effects volume and music volume separately.\n\nSubtitles & Captions\nPros:\n- Subtitles are easy to read and in good position on the lower part of the screen.\n- For HoH gamers, voice memos and tapes have subtitles and a timer to indicate when the recording is done playing.\n\nCons:\n- This game only offers subtitles, NOT captions.\n- Subtitles do not indicate who is talking.\n\n** Deaf gamers: no captions makes this game more challenging.  The stealth aspect means you must completely avoid bad guys, robots, and the alien.  It IS playable, but you may die a few times from not seeing something at first.**\n\nRated 7/10 for lack of captions vs subtitles.  This is significant since game relies on situational awareness.\n\nChatting/Communicating\nSingle player game; no chatting.\n\n---\nVisit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf","March 29, 2015","true","6.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

The game is seen from the perspective of Amanda Ripley who is daughter to the films protagonist Ellen Ripley, in searching for her she is transferred to the Sevastopol Space Station to find it in ruins and the station to be in chaos.\n\nThe Story holds up well, it has a lot of backstory to be found in the terminals and computers though because of the Nature of the game finding them all is easier said than done because the Alien can attack you at anytime. The later game story takes a small dive but the game always keeps you in suspense with a great musical score and tense gameplay, the ending itself maybe left to interpretation and some will like it and some will dislike it.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay of Alien Isolation is a first person horror survival game (Just take you pick from this market as it’s almost overflowing now.) but the game has its own unique twist in the name, Alien, the perfect organism. The game has you slowly creeping around a beautifully rendered and true to the film style ship and avoid dangers like Humans, androids and of course the Alien itself. Your goal is to never fight unless needed and always hide though that is easier said than done. You can collect weapons but all are useless against the Alien other than scaring it away a bit, Android’s will be your worst nightmare and on Hard difficulty Humans can one shot kill you, so, yeah stay hidden.\n\nWhilst this style of game seems very overdone right now Alien Isolation is able to rise above them all in terms of terror, graphics and gameplay having its own feet to stand on that I found very surprising but welcomed with open arms.\n\nGraphics and Sound:\nWhen I first played Alien Isolation at a convention I was instantly blown away by the graphical fidelity and the detailed crafted areas in the game this has happily transferred to the main game and looks amazing. The designed is lifted straight from the 1979 retro Sci-Fi themes and it felt like I was walking around the film set at the time. It boasts beautifully rendered 3D objects all the way down to the small buttons on the ship, amazing particle effects such as fire, next level lighting that really is the cream filling of this game is the lighting and an intense and personalised music track that is dynamic to what is happening in the game adding to the terrifying atmospheric vibe of the game.\nI had to graphical glitches or slowdowns when playing this game in 2K on my system, running at over 80/100fps it ran smoothly and looked amazing.\n\nI’ve only got a few issues with this game. It does feel like the last 3 hours or so are dragged out, I found myself running about a lot and when the game makes you walk in non atmospheric areas Ripley walks very slow and nothing to do. I also encountered a few Alien glitches when it would just lay on the floor and join me in the elevator but they were rare and comedic so added to enjoyment rather than dwindled it however the end game was a minor let down and this is where the game loses a point, very slow sluggish end with no real satisfactory ditch for survival or heroic bravery.\n\nPro’s:\n-	Amazingly rendered levels with top notch lighting and music to match the pace and suspense of the game\n-	As a horror game it sets out on what it does best, making you ♥♥♥♥ yourself\n-	Well voice acted with a nice backstory to the game\n\nCons:\n-	Repetitive gameplay (mostly apparently in the last hours of the game)\n-	Occasional bugs with the tracking device making me go around in circles\n-	Save system won’t be for everyone’s taste\n\nI give this game a 9/10.\nNearly perfect, the pacing is just way off in area’s and the gameplay does get repetitive but I’m hard pressed not to claim it’s one of the prettiest games I have ever seen and as a huge fan of the Alien franchise it feels good to finally find a true game worthy to have the name Alien on it.\n\n- Dean","October 13, 2014","true","13.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It really nails the atmosphere. A lot of people are going to complain about forced stealth sections against an enemy that isn't the Alien, but let's be fair here. There's a certain desperation and fear that other humans can give.

Think System shock 2 meets Alien meets Amnesia. The Alien is one of the greatest foes I have ever faced in all my years of gaming. It truly is the perfect organism and the perfect killing machine. Alien: Isolation by far the best alien game. Nothing will scare you the same way Alien: Isolation will scare you like no game ever will. Challenging, Deep, Complex, Intresting and Terrifying.

I love all the movies. I have, until now been disappointed with all of the games, save for AvP2 which had engrossing multiplayer.\n\nThis is an extremely good game. The fact that it's a movie based game for a franchise that typically releases ♥♥♥♥ games, is incredible.\n\nIt's a stealth game. It is ENTIRELY a stealth game. You have non-stealth options, but they're not the smartest. You need to be patient with everything you do. The stealth aspect trumps the horror aspect even. It's more stealth than survival horror. You can sneak through everything undetected if you're methodical and careful.\n\nThe atmosphere of the first film is nailed perfectly, and the mechanics are fun and interesting.\n\nThe minuses for me include character dialog animations, which with the characters looking as good as they do basically look like sock puppets when they speak, which is extremely unusual and slightly immersion breaking. Additionally, encounters with humans are not particularly interesting, though they are tense.\n\nThe best part of the game is the AI and how it operates via senses and learns (yes, learns) what you are doing to counter it.\n\nExample: in an early encounter with the alien I threw a smoke bomb, and it ran to investigate, letting me escape down a hall and lock a door.\n\nIn the next encounter I tried the same thing, and it turned to the smoke but did not investigate. Ditto for the third.\n\nBy the fourth time I did this, it decided,  "Okay, smoke bombs are not where food is, so I am going to look around elsewhere." This forced me to change up my tactics by dropping smoke bombs on myself. Great emergent gameplay, that.","October 6, 2014","true","33.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

This is a gorgeous looking game with very well considered gameplay, environment, character design, sound design and such. I have to give particular praise to the lighting engine, it's absolutely perfect. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by the voice acting or the facial animations but at this point the rest of the game outshines those petty flaws so incandescently as to render them null. This is an extremely tense game, I often found myself terrified at the androids, never mind the alien. I've not really noticed this "adaptive AI" that people talk about but the Alien is quite tricky. Extremely perceptive and always seems to notice the slightest sight or sound, it makes for one terrifying experience every time you encounter it. The story was also praiseworthy, it really captures what a survival horror is about, never too grandiose. The attention to detail here is beyond staggering. The gameplay elements like saving, crafting, minigames, the scattered computers, even the UI capture the 70's feel CA were going for in respect for the original Alien. It's as faithful as any diehard fan (of which I am not) could ever hope for (I imagine). It's a hell of a ride which will leave you with a considerably elevated heart rate, shakes and satisfaction when you finally evade that pesky Alien. Fan or not of the original movie, this is one game you absolutely must get, since I took the time to get out of my locker, hold my breath and write this review.

It honestly made me cry that after the ♥♥♥♥ I called a gem at one point, we could make such an utter masterpiece of the survival horror genre.

It just is so nerve racking that it makes you remeber the glory days of survival horror. The story of it is also on par with the movie, no easy feat I think, and finally the fact that they reunited the cast for the DLC was a dream come true for any die hard fan of the series.

I was sceptic at first, but once I started playing the game all my doubts went away.\n\nCreative Assembly did a fantastic job in carrying the tension of the first Alien film into the game: the audio and visuals are practically perfect, they capture the feeling of the first Alien film like no game before. This becomes more apparent if you watch the film before playing the game, you can really notice the attention and care to the details. The decision of having only one Alien stalking you throughout the whole game (like in Alien) was the best they could make. Trying to avoid the alien at all costs is one of the most rewarding experiences, it makes you feel so tense and terrified (also thanks to the save system, which uses save stations disseminated throughout the levels).\n\nThere are number of ways to deal with the alien (I won't say any :p), but the important facts to abide to are: keep moving, don't sprint, don't hide in the lockers forever. Most of the comments of people frustrated by the alien are consequences of not following those facts. So don't be depressed if the alien keeps catching you, you just have to understand how to play the game properly. ;D\n\nThis game should be played by anyone, it's not the best game ever, but it's a game that plays uniquely in its genre, it feels really different.\n\nPlay on hard, be smart, and enjoy!","October 18, 2014","true","17.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

I was so afraid that it was going to bomb, and that I was going to be severely disappointed.\nMy fears were for naught.\n\nIsolation is terrifying, without the crutch that is constant jump scares that so many horror games like to rely on. The horror in Isolation is purely in its brilliant atmosphere and the ambiance. (Believe me, there is nothing more unsettling than walking along a dark and quiet corridor and hearing the distant banging of the Xenomorph making its way through the ventilation shafts.)\n\nThe Alien itself is also incredible. Not only does it look amazing and is animated well, it’s smart. I swear its AI is some of the best I’ve seen in any game I’ve played. It felt as though a Xenomorph was plucked straight from the universe of Alien and dropped right into the game. If you encounter it, and you get its attention, there’s no running or hiding from it. You can scare it away with the flamethrower later on, but it only stays away for a short period before coming back. It is fast, and it is deadly. It will catch you. It doesn’t help the motion tracker (the most reliable method of tracking the Alien’s position) is purposefully not 100% accurate, making relying on it solely to figure out where the Xeno is a poor life choice.\n\nIsolation is also a true survival horror. You can fight back, yes; but ammo is painfully scarce and enemies (such as the endlessly unsettling Working Joes) absorb a lot of bullets before they go down. It is always better to creep past or craft a diversion item to distract the enemies than go in guns blazing, believe me. Plus the noise will attract the Alien, and you don’t want that.\nThe only complaint that I have is that the save stations felt a little sporadically placed at times, but really, it was only in a few areas, so it isn’t very relevant.\n\nEDIT: I can't believe I published this without talking about the Working Joes in more detail.\nThe Working Joes are Androids, but nothing like the ones we know from the Alien movies (Ash and Bishop). They are primitive and more like basic drones than intelligent robots, programmed with basic orders and functions. Automatonophobics beware: they are more visually akin to walking mannequins than the fully humanoid androids you're used to from the franchise.\nAnd holy crap are they ever terrifying, even when they're peaceful. Their unnervingly monotonous voices and scripted dialogue (things such as "You are becoming hysterical", "You always know a Working Joe" and "I am going to catch you") make them all that more unsettling. To make it worse they're tough, too; as I said, it takes a lot of shots to take them down, and most of the time it's better if you just ran or hid instead of fighting back.\n\ntldr;\n\nPros:\nLoyal to the source material, if you are a fan of Alien you will love it.\nGenuine survival horror\nScary without Jumpscares\nAmazing atmosphere and ambiance\n\nCons:\nSporadic save points in a few areas, may get frustrating quickly if you mess up and die a lot, and the repeated lost progress can get disconcerting.\nAlien AI is very intelligent, making the game more difficult as a result, which, again, can be frustrating at times.\n\nOverall rating: 9/10\nIf you love survival horror, GET THIS GAME!","January 1, 2015","true","11.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

Alien is my all-time favorite film and Creative Assembly have done an astonishing job of crafting a game faithful to its aesthetic.  This sort of thing never happens.  Still wary of reports I hear that it comes undone toward the end, but I'm still hopeful, and even if it somehow goes down the tubes during the last few hours these first few have been very fulfilling and I don't see any reason to think that's going to change in the foreseeable hours to come...!  Very, very happy with this.\n\nedit: Having now played ten or eleven hours of the game I would say that it continues to impress.

I like the game (as you can tell from the thumbs up), BUTT, there is a lot of s*^t I got annoyed about and really really hated in this game.  And instead of doing pros and cons like I normally do I'll list them all at once.\n\nREVIEW TIME:\n\nPro = Story/time length: The story in this is simple, you're Ellen Ripley's daughter, Amanda, and Sevastapol station is said to have a recorder of her mother and what had really happened with the Nostromo.  That's the main plot of the game, and then of course the alien walking around.  The game is LONG too, it's like 18 hours or so, and that's a LOT compared to other games that are like half of that, if that.\n\nPro = Atmosphere: The tension in this game is amazing, especially since I immerse myself in games, unlike half the t#$ts that play horror games that just speed through it without a single care in the world.  It's tense, you don't feel safe at all throughout the whole game, and that's hard to achieve in a lot of games.\n\nPro/con = Detail: There is a huge variety of detail in the maps and people you interact with, but there is one thing I don't like, well 2 actually.  The main one is the lip syncing can be atrocious sometimes, I mean it's not as bad as Sonic Adventure or anything but it isn't as amazing as something like GTA.  The other thing I don't like is that sometimes the characters tone/voice seems odd/offputting in some instances, where they sound weird or don't fit their emotion.\n\nPro = Fluff text: It's everywhere, mainly in terminals though, and there is a lot to read.  It's quite amazing how much detail into the story these guys put into the game and as well as the station itself.\n\nCon = You always know a working Joe!: God f*%k these guys, I hate them and everything they stand for.  I played on the Hard difficulty right? And it takes like 2 whole clips of a revolver to just kill one of them, not to mention they take away a decent ammount of health when they F*%KING CHOKE YOU AND IT TAKES FOREVER TO PULL AWAY.  On top of that the alien won't attack them so you can't rely on the alien to at least assist your a$$ with it.\n\nPro/con = Crafted items: I like the fact you can craft stuff, I really do, but I also wish they would've gave the player a bit of a push to USE them.  See in games like this I tend to horde a lot of the stuff I find, and making me use stuff I have is really hard to do, unless i'm full of whatever item it is.  Not only that I hardly ever used any of the stuff that I crafted except for something like a molly or a pipe bomb.  As I've said if they gave you a big push to USE them I migh've actually BOTHERED to USE THEM.\n\nCon = Stealth: The stealth in this game is abysmal, it mainly acts like Payday's, and that's the worse kind, basically even if you think you're hiddin you really aren't.  It goes based off of wherever the enemies head is looking at as well as can you see their head, if you can see their head when you're hiding that means that they can see you, meaning if you think you're hidden you really actually aren't hidden at all, and you can get caught most of the time from it because of that fact.\n\nPro/Con = Save states: I like how they made the game have save states, but that's not to say that's all that nice.  See you have to get the player to move ahead regardless of if they want to or not, and if you're far from a save station or went really ahead and died you then have to go through all of that bull s*%t again.  Yeah sure auto saves or saving whenever you want might have plauged the horror genre a bit and even some other games, but trust me, doing all of the same s*^t you've done for hours gets extremely annoying.  There was one point I died like 15 times at one point after doing like half a hour or more of work each and I just went "F%*K IT!" and rage quit so hard....actually that might have been when I got rid of this game.  But still, a so*%ing checkpoint system wouldn't kill ya Creative Assembly.\n\nPro/Major Con: The Alien and his AI: Don't get me wrong I love the way the alien acts but there is a HUGE GLARING PROBLEM I hate with it, and it's what got me really angry at this game.  "Oh the Alien has Unpredictable AI!" Pffffft, my a$$ he does, he has what I call the "Leash" effect, which is where he won't stray too far from the player, making it incredibly annoying to do anything, and that's the biggest problem I have with this game.  You know all of those terminals and such laying around? I barely bothered to go after any of them, unless it was a requirement, and that's a huge red flag to me cause I love reading fluff text and seeing what's really been going on in the station and game itself.  But with the alien constantly on me I barely even gave a s*%t over any of the terminals or even go to other rooms and collect what was in them.  So much for un-f%$king-predictable, he just wonders around you to whole time and sometimes goes over to you.  But I did find a mod that fixed this stupid problem, it's litterally called "Unpredictable Alien" and the alien actually IS NOW, he'll go around the ENTIRE MAP and pop up whenever, and even look around farther from you or closer sometimes, giving you time to look at the terminals and explore rooms sometimes if you think you have enough time, and this is SO MUCH BETTER, now I can actually look at everything and read the dialogue.  The last thing I hate about the alien is that you can get caught out of god damn nowhere, most of my deaths before I modded this game I was killed because he just charged after me when I didn't run, pull of a shot, or anything of that nature, seriously that is such BS most of the time.\n\nConclusion: I give it a 7/10, if you mod it it's much better, but that's what I think the base game is worth, get it when it's cheaper I say.","August 15, 2015","true","20.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Then I decided to pre-purchase this game around 1 week before release and I really have to say it was all worth it.\n\nThe graphics of this game are simply awesome, I thought "Can my PC even run this game on low settings due to the fact that my graphic card is just 1 above the minimum and ages beneath the recommended one, but my thoughts were definitely wrong. The game is optimized very well so that I was always able to run it on medium/high settings with shaders etc. turned on medium up to high without having a single lag. So being a little bit over the minimum should make you being able to run it pretty good.\n\nAnother important point is the story, of course.\nSo to be quite honest, I haven't watched the "Alien" movies but I was always kind of interested in space stuff, was a bit curious.\nThe game has had a lot of moments where I thought "Wow" because the story has a good background and is very very interesting even for people that have not seen the movies.\n\nThe gameplay has always been very very exciting and dramatic, the incredibly awesome sound and light effects just improved that. I have played the game with a controller and I have never had a single problem with shooting/running away precisely so don`t be afraid of using one.\nSo the game has a lot of very shocking and exciting moments and I definitely don`t regret that I have bought the game and I have enjoyed every second I played even if I didn't make some missions at the first or even after the 5th try but I have always been patient and thought "Give it another try, other people are able to do it so I can do it as well".\n\nSo all in all it is an awesome game that has alot of exciting and wow- moments with an awesome atmosphere and incredibly good light and sound effects and I can only RECOMMEND this game to anyone who's a bit into space stuff and/or has or hasn't watched the movies so almost everyone.\nBig YES from my side.","October 29, 2014","true","29.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I have all the movies and can't count anymore how many times I've watched them. This appeared to be the first really good Alien game. And it definitely could be. The first few hours I loved it. But then the game slipped extremely close past perfection right into my "games, I will never finish"-corner.\n\n-Spoiler-\nHow the game should be imo:\nThe Alien appears. You manage to not get noticed. You hide for some time. After a while the Alien goes away to search other areas of the space station. You have some time to do your stuff. After a while it comes back (maybe sooner, maybe later, maybe much later) and you need to hide again.\n\nHow it actually is:\nThe Alien appears. You manage to not get noticed. You hide for some time. The Alien will lurk around the same, small area, making its rounds forever. When you leave your hiding place, you need to rush to the next one, as the Alien will walk by just a few seconds later. If you stay in the hideout, it will find you eventually. Every time it walks by, you have a random chance that it inspects the hideout. Then you need to hold your breath and lean back, where you have another random chance to not get caugt.\nIt's all about exact timing and luck. It's much too random and there is not enough room to make this whole thing interesting.\nThe worst thing is that the game never gives you a hint what the "proper way" is. I often had no idea what i'm supposed to do. When I managed to escapte the Alien, it felt mostly like mere luck, or that the ai had some glitch.\n\nThe game builds up a solid atmosphere in the first hours. But as soon as you encounter the Alien for the first time, it will never leave your side ever again. There are many survivors on the station, yet it's focused only on you. It attacks other people only if it's part of the story or if they stay directly in its line towards you.\n\nIt seems that it can smell or hear you from miles away somehow. But when it has found the general area where you are, it suddenly can't smell or hear you anymore, even from a few feet away. Yet it seems to know for sure that you are somewhere around. No matter how silent you were before. And it won't leave the area until you leave.\n\nIt's completely scripted. The Alien never freely walks around the station. It's always where you are.\nThere are 2 states.\nFirst you can only hear it. (it never comes out, no matter how long you wait)\nThen it comes out at a specific point. (and never goes away).\n\nIt could be one of my favourite games. It's extremely close to the first movie. The graphics are great. The atmosphere is intense. The sound effects are one of the best i've heard. I like the Idea that there are also other dangers, such as desperate survivors or malfunctioning androids.\nBut the Alien is way over the top.\nIt suddenly changes - what has started as an exciting horror/surival-Adventure - into an annoying hide & seek orgy.\n-Spoiler end-\n\nHaving to repeat 5, 10 and 20 minute parts over and over (even if you use the save points as much as possible) is no fun anymore at some point. A game should be a challenge. You need to fail sometimes to keep a game interesting. But there is a thin line between fun and frustration. For me it has exceeded this line greatly.\n\nJust my point of view. It could be a 10/10 game for you.","August 23, 2015","false","7.6"," 68 of 121 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","68","121","6","4"

So honest to the source material, they even made sure every physical item in the game could be duplicated as props with materials available in 1978.\n\nThis is definitely one of my favourite games of all time.

An incredible journey and a spectacular tribute to the original Alien (1979) movie.\nI can easily say that this is the scariest game I have ever played and lately I have played a lot of scary horror games like Penumbra, Amnesia and Outlast for example. But this one beats all of those, I never felt so relieved for completing a game, and not because it was getting boring, it was just that scary.\n\nThis game is set 15 years after Ridley Scott’s original Alien movie, and in it you get to play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley. She is an engineer for the mega corporation Weyland-Yutani. She gets embarks on a journey that gets her on the Sevastapol Station when she found out that the flight recorder of her mother’s lost ship, the Nostromo is being held there. Unfortunately when she gets on the mysteriously abandoned space-city, rapidly she notices that something has gone terribly wrong.\n\nHow awesome Sevastapol is. The art design and the attention to detail in this game excels in the videogame industry. Even more when there are so many things so thoroughly recreated to match Ridley Scott’s vision in the first Alien movie. A lot of fan service in this game, a great tribute to the Alien series. The graphics are also top notch, specially the lightning which is one of the best I have ever seen in a game. The broken doors, lights flickering and steam from broken pipes, all those little details make up for this horrifying atmosphere. Menus are also slick, easy to navigate and straight to the point, as the hud. You also have a good amount of in-game video settings to tweak.\n\nThe sound design is also brilliantly done, amazingly good. It borrows a lot of the familiar sounds from the original movie and has a vital role in the stealth mechanic. I played this with headphones (I advise you to play with them too) and I could hear every little detail vital to my survival with them. You can even track the Alien just by hearing its steps, giving a huge sense of tension and immersion to the game. Soundtrack is also pretty amazing, it gets the vibe of the original Alien movie.\n\nIn the matter of gameplay its not formidable, but pretty damn good nevertheless. The Alien AI really shines in this game. Its behavior is unpredictable, far from being scripted. Its very impressive and really gives you the feel of being hunted. You really have to get a strategy on how to deceive the alien and be extremely cautious because he can get you when you less expect it.\nYou also face other enemies like some survivor groups still in the space station, as some androids called "Working Joes", which are amazingly bland enemies when in comparison with the Alien. For me one of the only downsides in this game are the encounters with the androids, they get pretty lame and repetitive after a while.\nThe game also has a crafting system that lets you build multiple items from EMP mines, smoke bombs, molotovs and plenty other cool stuff and you also have some nice weapons.\n\nThe longevity is pretty good too, I completed it in about 15 hours, I did not played it in a rush, neither went to explore every corner of the game. Unfortunately the last quarter of the game is a little bit weaker than the rest of the game, still good though, but not as good as the remaining of the journey through Sevastapol Station.\nI also found the difficulty spot on, not too hard, neither too easy, it gave me a good challenge, and made me think about my decisions carefully since the game has manual saves (played on medium).\nControls are also good, I played the game with a keyboard + mouse and never had any issues.\n\nThe story is the "Achilles heel" of this game, unfortunately it is very disappointing. At first you get curious about how the story will develop but soon enough you discover that the story in this game is nothing than just a way of getting you from place to place. The weak characters and bland voice acting also do not help the story. It has some good moments though, but as an whole it is pretty weak.\n\nPerformance wise it is almost excellent. I played with a mix of medium and max settings and the game performed flawlessly in my laptop around the 50-60 fps mark.\n\nSummary\nPros:\nIncredible recreation of the original Alien movie feel\nAmazing atmosphere and graphics\nIncredible sound design\nTense and scary encounters with the Alien\nManual saves\nGood lengthCons:\nWeak story\nNon-alien encounters feel repetitiveMy personal score: 9.0\n\nIf you like the Alien franchise do not think twice, get this amazing game. In case you love stealth games and/or horror games get this one too because you will have a blast playing it. The incredible atmosphere will make you fall in love with this game at first sight. It really deserves to be bought in order to reward the developers for the amazing job and risk they took with this game.","June 1, 2015","true","15.1"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","21","33","4","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/214490/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Isolation sports a single player campaign that takes more than 15 hours to accomplish. The campaign can take even longer if you are willing to find all collectibles throughout Sevastopol station where the journey takes you. Now, the game does have some backtracking that some may find tedious - this 15 hour or so long mission does slow down a bit (especially towards the end). It is, in my opinion, not necessarily a problem.\n\nYou take control of Amanda (Ripley's daughter) who sets out to get hold of the Nostromo's flight recorder which is said to have been found and taken to Sevastopol. Naturally, problems ensue upon arrival and sooner than expected you find yourself on a station with the desperate need to escape - especially after encountering the xenomorph for the first time as Amanda and her crew finally know what they are dealing with.\n\nThe story has some interesting characters as well as some twists. Several articles popped up on the internet detailing some of story elements and its plot holes. Personally, I found every bit of Amanda's story engaging including the somewhat cliffhanger-esque ending.\n\nNow, let's talk about the gameplay. It is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G! And scary as hell! You can't just run around as you wish as the alien is on you in a matter of seconds. You will hide in lockers but the xenomorph will get you many times. Still, practice makes perfect, right? I like how it reacts to the noises you make. Also, hiding in a locker does not always prove to be a sanctuary - you need to lean back if it starts sniffing about. You even have to hold your breath for a while. Also, turning on your motion tracker can easily give your position away.\n\nThe alien cannot be killed. You do have firearms at your disposal but leave those for the thieving humans and malfunctioning androids. Fire, while it does not kill the xenomorph either, has its positive effects. Whether it be your flamethrower or recently crafted molotov it does scare the creature away. But not for long, mind you! The fun part: the alien and an android in the same, confined space. Just listen to what the latter has to say to the former! It is simply hilarious!\n\nNow, the game has stunning visuals. The fire effects are - in my opinion - the best of all the effects I have seen to date! You do some space walking, too, and the rays / lights / flying debris all have their jaw-dropping effect. Expectation, naturally, was for the xenomorph effects to be accurate and make no mistake the developer guys delivered! Coupled with the excellent sound effects the game can truly be terrifying at times. For me, in this genre, Outlast has the 1st place but Isolation barely missed the same spot!\n\nI was very satisfied with what Creative Assembly / SEGA accomplished here. Perhaps one of the reasons was my distaste for the latest Aliens vs Predator game or (and this is a more obvious example due to its xeno only nature) the atrocious Aliens-based Colonial Marines. Or simply the guys did a wonderful job and delivered the best alien experience in video game history to date! And let's not forget I have yet to check the game on hard difficulty setting and also look at its Survival mode!\n\nThis is CorvusCorax, one of the Isolation players, signing off.\n\nPS: I usually do not like DLC contents especially if they are short. Please let me know which of the available 4 are worth purchasing and why. At this point I find it expensive to pay the discounted value (cca 13 euros) for the season pass which is exactly the value I got the base game for.","March 30, 2015","true","48.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","14","20","2","6"

Meaning that it's being looked at taking the books, comics, movies, etc. into account, as the game was made under the Fox license.\n\nI am VERY impressed by the design of the game. They fulfilled all my exceptions of the Lo-fi sci-fi environment they promised.\nThey have this filter on the game by default that subtly adds that static effect you'd get on an old CRT monitor and/or an old CRT TV. It hits the nostalgia VERY well. It holds the modern graphics, modern physics, and modern mechanics while giving it a very nice classical feel to it.\nExploring the entryway you see a handheld that looks like an old SNES controller with a screen on it. It's managed to encapsulate the whole 70's vision of the future VERY well. They hit it spot on by designing everything only in a manner that could be replicated on set of the original Alien movie.\nThere's the loading bar when you use a terminal, and many other things that were accepted in the late 70's/early 80's that were just accepted as part of the territory, which adds to the ambiance even more. The Xenomorph is a standard Xenomorph drone, and the AI behind it was phenominal.\n\nNow for the only issue I see with the game. The lore and justification behind it. Yes, CA said they wanted to base the alien off of the original Alien movie, and yes they did say they wanted only one.  Therein lies the problem. You, as Ripley's daughter arrive on the space station Sevastopol after the Xenomorph has been onboard for quite some time. Even the original Nostromo Xenomorph took Dallas and Brett's body into the air shafts to create more Xenomorphs, as is customary for the Drone caste to do.\n\nIn the absence of a Queen, a Drone possesses the ability to create a complete reproductive life cycle that did not require a Queen to lay more Eggs. Rather, the Drone would cocoon a victim in its Hive, and the victim would subsequently be changed by unknown means into a new Egg containing a Facehugger. Footage of this process was shot for Alien, although it was later removed from the final print of the film. The sequence was, however, included in the novelization of the film, and the movie footage was subsequently reintegrated in the 2003 Director's Cut. Note that this is Alien, not Aliens. Meaning that the reproductive cycle is outlined in the original film, that the game should be based upon.\n\nThe entire process  would only take a few days at absolute most, meaning that there SHOULD be more Xenomorphs on the station, as they're a very hive oriented species, with reproduction being very high on the list of priorities. They should also be extrordinarily flammable and should be able to be killed by fire at the very least, although ultimately I do think the Xenomorph should be able to be killed anyways in the game. I see why CA did what they did, and they said what they want, but the Alien fan in me has a hard time following their attempted rationalization when so much of the pre-established source material, even the original Alien film, speaks against it. They used aspects of the Alien, but they ignored alot of what makes it THE Alien, and that's the only part of the game where they really fell short.\n\nThe game is fantastic, as an Alien game, it's better than most. For nerds like myself who love the entirety of the lore, there are some moments where CA sacrificed continuity for gameplay, which ultimately comes down to your own preferences. I could see why they did it, and the resulting gameplay is utterly astounding. With Dan Abnett onboard, I think they could have gone farther than they did. I don't feel that this is the ultimate Alien game, or that it's the best we'll get, but it's definitely a step in the right direction. Creative assembly made an astounding game, with solid gameplay, which resulted in an utterly superior survival horror experience. It was a shakey ride as far as the lore went, so that's the only area I can truly deduct a point from.\n\nOverall, this game is a 9/10. I'll be playing it again and don't regret buying it.","October 7, 2014","true","5.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Three hours in on the hardest difficulty and I can definitely say that the immersion never is broken, I can sit all day and play this game and still feel the tension and the anxiety. You can hear the Alien stalking you all throughout the beginning, little hisses and metallic clanks and he crawls above you. You hide in a locker but if you make the slightest noise, be it from your motion tracker or your breath, the Alien will rip off the door. The Androids seem invincible, you shoot them over and over again, they catch your melee attacks. This game is probably one of the most atmospheric and terrifying game I've ever played, it rivals Outlast and Amneisa: TDD, and even some of the older Silent Hill games.

It is, surely one of the best games of 2014 and possibly the best horror game i've played in a long time.\nThe story is simple, but very functional and even interesting at times, because it involves the story and cast of the original one (just a little of, mind you) because this a story about Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, of the Nostromo crew in the original Alien movie. It is a sequel to the first alien, and you can play it like that, but its more an homage, a love letter to the horror, the atmosphere, and the classic design by HR Giger of the original creature, the unknown terror that lurks in the guts of this gigantic space station, the Sevastopol. And like it's name, all the game reeks of industrial futuristic design, lots of metal, steam, dark passages, strange noises, and a few surprises along the way...\n\nMany people had praised the game for it's quality, graphics, sound, artificial intelligence for the creature, the game itself, the excellent design of all things and objects in game, the horror, the intensity of the experience, even playing on easier modes...but i think they are overlooking something else. There is something else to this game i think... something that's resonating with many people of different ages, different backgrounds and tastes in gaming...\n\nI've played games, consoles and pc, for many many years (since the 90s) and alltough it has been said already about video games as an art form, and being the new medium for telling stories, there was (there is) still some kind of stigma of video games being not at all a serious medium, like movies and cinema, a stigma of being...well, mostly for kids, and teens, maybe young adults MAYBE but not really for adults.... You know , like, if you have 40 years or more and you play games it is kind of inmature... (And i think that kind of thinking is completely wrong)\n\nWell, playing this game, i've been scared to death (many times) and the game was difficult, the game was scary, not at all like any game i've played...and yes..it's not for every one...it is not for people that don't like this genre, it is more for adults that wants to play (And experience) an alien story, but more than that, a Sci Fi Horror story, real sci fi, real horror, and it doesn't make any apologies for that.. i think it is one of the first of its kind , and more importantly, it shows that YOU CAN HAVE many different genres in gaming, many different kinds of stories, and public, for different kinds of games (not just the 4 or 5 types of games that are going around these days)\n\nEven more, this game has raised the bar so high in terms of what to expect of a horror game, true horror, that i think, this is one of those few games, that believe or not, will change all the games (of it's genre) that come after it, because, just simply because, every other horror game from now one will be compared to this one... maybe it is not so clear at this point still, but i think time will show more and more what i mean...for better and for worse also (many space horror games will follow, that try to copy/emulate the success of alien isolation with silly results. But also, i think..i hope, this will show that you can make good quality games, with focus placed in story, atmosphere, design, all in service to tell different kinds of stories, experiment and reach for the different ways of expression in this art form that we love.","August 23, 2015","true","129.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattFiler/recommended/214490/","MattFiler","MattFiler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MattFiler/","77 products in account","From start to finish, the atmosphere of this game is superb, the set design is very detailed and interesting which helps to make the experience have some decent replay value which is good for a horror/survival game. Collectibles (some of which in this game are very worth looking out for) and achievements also invite you to play multiple times if you're interested in those.\n\nTalking of replay value, the AI of the Xenomorph works on a random path meaning that it is different every time you replay sections which sometimes happens often, due to Alien/synthetic/human related deaths. The randomness of the AI really helps to push the game along and keep you playing. It can be so scary sometimes because there is no way of predicting what he will do next. All my time in-game and modding, I still get scared when the Alien drops down!\n\nI love the idea of the save stations. It's a controversial game mechanic for some, but it makes the game a lot more challenging and really gives you a sense of achievement when you spot one lurking at the end of the corridor. The worst feeling in the world is being killed as you save though, so make sure to stay quiet!\n\nI previously had this game on the Xbox 360 and have just played through on the Xbox One as well. The console experience of this game was great but the graphics were significantly reduced. One thing worth noting between the next-gen console and PC versions is that there are some differences in the game, worryingly with the next-gen console version getting some more in-game animated screens and interactive objects than the PC version. From a technical point of view, this is due to the fact that The Creative Assembly exported the final PC build incorrectly. It's set in the same optimisation group as previous-gen consoles meaning that these in-game effects that next-gen consoles get are disabled (even though the graphics options are better on PC). Not exactly a deal-beaker, especially how cheap the game is on Steam in the sales, but worth mentioning. Also worth mentioning that this issue is Windows only.\n\nI love this game (not only do I have my Steam hour count but I've also played through on Xbox One, Xbox 360 and have done hundreds of hours of modding), although it's not all praise. The game, as everything does, has its downsides.\n\nThe synthetics are really frustrating at times and can almost ruin the atmosphere, they increase the difficulty so high at points that it takes your focus away from the stealth element since you are forced to sprint away from them, but sometimes this can then end in death by the Xenomorph. I wouldn't say that the game is ever too hard, things are pretty well balanced, but there are definitely some areas that seem unfair.\n\nAlongside this, talking of other AIs, the humans can be quite useless sometimes. They seem to infinitely shoot towards your location even if you are hidden behind something that the bullets cannot penetrate through, their speech also seems to be very limited if you're around them for a while - I heard them repeat the same thing numerous times which really takes you out of the game. There are a nice range of animations for the humans though and some areas of the game give the humans some interesting dialogue (mission 7 for example) which really can help to build the game world.\n\nThere are some things that can be a bit immersion-breaking. For example, when you kill humans they drop their weapons however you can't pick them up. You do get weapons later in the game, but early on in mission 3 you have the opportunity to kill humans but you can't take their weapons. It's not a massive deal but it can be frustrating if you're in a bad situation.\n\nSomething that a lot of reviewers have complained about is the revising of areas multiple times. I never really found this to be a problem myself as when you revisit areas in the campaign, they're normally slightly different. You can choose to backtrack to get collectibles, but that's optional and you're not forced to.\n\nSome level design problems can be found in-game like joins between models leaving gaps into space, but this is not a major issue and I've only spotted two or three in-game when purposefully looking for them. Although some levels can be repetitive in the models and designs, this is acceptable due to the setting and the detail is really quite awesome.\n\nIf they do make a sequel to this game (please!), hopefully they will explain the ending. I kinda like how it's open to your own interpretation at the end of Isolation but I think after such a long campaign centering on Amanda getting closure, it should really have been handled better.\n\nMoaning over, this game is definitely worth a play - but you should have some kind of understanding of the Alien/Aliens films to get the connection between Amanda and Ellen for some emotional scenes to pay off. It's not needed, but definitely helps for some plot aspects.\n\n9/10 - would most definitely of been a 10 if we had official mod tools!\n\nTL;DR: Very good game, definitely worth a purchase if you enjoy survival horror, sci-fi or Alien.","December 2, 2014","true","176.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The story is interesting, the characters for the most part quite engaging and of course the "creature of unknown origin" is terrifying.\n\nGameplay mostly consists of "Fix the thing" which then breaks so it becomes "fix the other thing" which also breaks so it becomes "fix the third thing", from which you hop from vent to vent or cupboard to cupboard. The pacing therefore was a little slower than I prefer, but it absolutely works regardless and it does help build and deliver tension. Cowering in a crawl space with an alien snorting right in front of you as it searches for you is un-nerving!\n\nI got the game on considerable discount (75% off) and it was more than worth the price I paid for it. It's a good stealth game whether you like Alien or not (I'm no huge fan of the films but I like them). Sevastopol (the space station you are on) is a pile of junk but its a nice place to explore. Once you get the hang of constructing items and using them (ie distractions) the gameplay is good fun. It takes a while before you get any of the interesting weapons but they certainly add a bit of flavour in the later stages of the game.\n\nThere are plenty of surprises, nothing is "on rails" and the sound effects are wonderfully mixed in. A few missions away from the space station provide a nice change of pace. I wasn't so satisfied with the ending, but that doesn't  taint the overall experience.\n\nRecommended, especially if it's on sale. I'm yet to try survivor mode as I can't see much replay value in the story mode, but am glad I bought it and played it.\n\n+ Excellent atmosphere\n+ Scary alien!\n+ Awesome sound effects\n\n- Back & forth objectives a bit tiresome\n- Some secondary characters deserve to die\n- Epic finalé let down by a somewhat copout outro sequence\n\n7/10","May 20","true","25.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You must do what you need to survive, this includes crafting gear, hacking terminals, fighting other humans and hiding from the Alien itself.\n\nWhere do I start with Alien: Isolation? From the very start of the game, Creative Assembly makes players feel like they are, really aboard on the USCSS Torrens. The production quality if this game is really astounding as every door, window, floor, wall and everything inside of the ship has that genuine feeling of a ship you'd see in the set of an H.R Giger movie.\n\nWhat I really like about Alien: Isolation is that the game doesn't throw hundreds of xenomorphs at you like Aliens: Colonial Marines or Aliens vs Predator did. Instead, the game puts you in a more intimate situation where you are alone with one creature, it's hard to kill so it's easier to hide in a ventilation shaft and hope that you'll find a way to outsmart it.\n\nThe story is what you would expect from an Aliens plot, you go somewhere, things go wrong, then you come face to face with it and from then on you're both scavenging and running. It's typical but it's great that they've finally captured that feeling 100% in a game. There are no surprises really, if you're a fan of the Aliens movies then you'll know what to expect.\n\nPros  Immersive environment, interact with almost everything\nQuality story and characters throughout\nThe Xenomorph model is paintakingly detailed\nFull controller support\nCons Transporters take too long to wait for and ride on\nFrom time to time the Alien may glitch\nNo Steam Trading Cards or Badges\nLimited locale because you're on a space station, everything looks industrial. Might get boring to look at after awhile.\nFinal thoughts:\nIf you have ever considered yourself a fan of the Aliens franchise, if you were disappointed with Aliens: Colonial Marines, if you love Survival Horror games - then you owe it to yourself to try this game out. Creative Assembly and Sega did it right, this game is enough to satisfy anyone who falls under the 3 catagories I just mentioned.\n\nRating (9.1 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 19","true","5.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

I like how they developed it in general. The Alien franchise always was a cult hit, giving the feeling of being alone and lost in space, with a horror stalking the corners of your world. This is one of the few games that truly succeeds in my opinion to deliver an authentic, heart in mouth experience, playing as Ripley in a situation that descends further and further into horror.\n\nIt will take you some time to complete, and gives you the option to do some exploring on the side. I liked looking along the walls for all the extra detail and thought that went into the design, such as the graffiti, posters, food and objects lying around, and dark shadowed areas that make you think twice before venturing into them. Your character is not the kind of character who will going around kicking skulls and taking names. This isn't a game where you can shoot your way through everything. It's a game where you need to be quiet at the right points, run at the right moments, crawl through those creepy bloodstained vents, and stop making stupid decisions that will otherwise get you killed every other second. Because you will die. A lot.\n\nThe missions have the tension needed to make you feel anywhere you go could be dangerous. Every closet you see, you wonder when you'll be back there to hide in it later. The pacing is slow for me at the start, though it does pick up later. The storyline is great to follow, helping you to get drawn in and like the characters and the sequence of events that progress from bad to worse. I won't reveal what exactly happens here because you should play it yourself ... unless you found Alien a scary film. Then maybe not.\n\nI will say that you can assume everyone else around you except yourself is expendable. Try not to get too attached to them.\n\nI don't like the crafting UI so much, it seems a little clunky for me. The music/sounds is always a big thing for horror games as they add to the fear factor, and it fits in just right to give you the feeling you are indeed isolated in space. You ideally to play it with a headset to get the full immersion and atmosphere the game delivers. It's not quite the same with speakers.\n\nPros\n\nStoryline\nMusic/Atmosphere\nCreepy stations, people, and of course, the alien ...\n\nCons\n\nCan get motion sickness from some of the movement\nPrice\n\nTL;DR\n\nOverall Verdict\nI think everybody should try this game, with a spare set of pants next to them in case things happen. You will get sucked into this game, you will get scared and you will hide in closets.\nAnd probably not want to come out of them again.\nI will say though I think the price is a little bit too expensive, so I would recommend waiting until it's on sale. Otherwise it's something that belongs proudly in your steam library.\n\n\nWant to read more of my reviews?

I purposefully kept my expectations low after the disaster that was Aliens: Colonial Marines but this game is *infinitely* better than I could have imagined.\n\nPerhaps what I love most about this game is how it treats you like an adult - you bought a survival horror game and you're damn well gonna get it, good and hard. If you die, it's back to the last manual save station. If you make too much noise, you're gonna get caught. If you get shot at, you've got about 7 more seconds to live because they *will* kill you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fenixp/recommended/214490/","Fenixp","Fenixp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fenixp/","536 products in account","Let me start off with a small history lesson: I have seen the first Alien movie in 2002 or so, and I really liked it. Coincidentally, this was one year after I got my first gaming computer and was actually getting into videogames in a big way. The first thing I thought was "This would make for an amazing videogame!"\n\nBut a shining beacon of hope appeared in the distance as I have discovered that there indeed is a game which is considered good from Alien universe (sort of), Aliens vs Predator by Rebellion. So I got that. And while it was scary enough as a Marine, Alien wasn't this constant, ever present threat which was to be feared - Aliens were just common monsters, which would give you a scare, but weren't really all that difficult to defeat. I liked the game, sure, but something just wasn't quite there. It reminded me of the second movie far more than it did of the first, and the fact that I seemed to move at warp speed didn't help either. Since then, two more Aliens vs Predator games got released, and shortly after those, Aliens: Colonial Marines came out. And finally, 12 years in which I have revisited the original movie a few times and every time hoped for a proper Alien game to exist, one came out. And it is nearly all I hoped it would be.\n\nAlien: Isolation throws everything you would traditionally do when returning to a movie that old out of the window and executes everything with a beautiful attention to detail, replicating everything from visual design, sounds of the original, music, hell, the game even got the original cast of the fist movie on board to do voice acting. The game doesn't try to modernize, it doesn't try to make the game 'more believable' for a 21st century consumer - nah, it just says ♥♥♥♥ that, converts everything we could see in the original movie into in-game assets and ends up being that much more thrilling, nostalgic and believable for it. It's a game made by fans of the movie, for fans of the movie, a huge love letter to everything the original is.\n\nI could probably start talking about the game tho, right? Yeah, I should do that. So, you're playing as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley. Ellen Ripley has been considered lost for 15 years, and Amanda has been informed about black box of Nostromo finding its way to Sevastopol space station. Soon after arriving on station, she finds that everything has gone to hell, surviving people are fighting for remaining resources, androids kill on sight for trespassing, and on top of that, there is talk of some creature murdering people.\n\nThe game is mostly a stealth-based survival horror, with very few tools to defend yourself with (and while you get more of those as you progress trough the game, you very rarely get to have enough ammo), so you're left to a motion tracker and your wit to stay alive. The game gives you many tools for distracting your enemies, be it humans, androids or the Alien. You can craft items, some of which can cause direct damage, others which can serve to distract. Some levels have conveniently placed 'rewire boxes', which allow you to turn off cameras, open doors or cause distractions in various parts of a level. You can hide in lockers, vents or just low spaces like under desks or beds. These elements, and parts of the game where you need to get around humanoid opponents, mostly reminded me of games similar to Outlast or Amnesia. Individual areas tend to be open enough to allow for a decent amount of ways to get around various obstacles, and the level design itself is quite beautiful, varied and clever to keep you interested. All in all, when you're up against more traditional threats, Alien: Isolation is a good stealth game, and a decent shooter in the rare occassions you choose to approach it that way. When you explore the station, it also very rarely happens that you'd get locked out of a section of it, and so you can go back to most places you've already been - and there's even a reason to do so as more equipment you gain will open up more secret areas for you.\n\nHowever, all of this changes after the Alien makes its first appearance. Suddenly, you're not just worrying about the traditional opponents. There's always the threat of the Alien, lurking above you, making its way trough ventilation ducts of the entire station. If you run too fast - you may attract the Alien. If you hit a wall with your maintenance jack, it might distract your opponents, but it might also attract the Alien. If you fire your gun, you don't just fire your gun - you may attract the Alien. (that also applies to human opposition tho - while the Alien ignores androids, when someone shoots at you and the Alien is nearby, it will jump out of airduct and start working its way trough any human it sees. Including you of course.)\n\nThe creature's AI is good enough to differenciate it from all other opponents, to make it a constant threat and to make you nervous about it, as you see a green dot on your movement tracker, circling around you somewhere above. Those are the calm bits of the game tho - when it emerges and you can see it, everything gets a lot worse as, most of the time, it only takes the Alien to notice you once for you to pretty much instantly die. Oh, and it can kill you from the vents if you miss the dribbling ooze or are foolish enough to take a look what exactly is it dribbling from. All of these aspects are frustrating, yes, along with the fact that the Alien is a lot more perceptive than the other opponents, you are going to die a lot and the only way to save your game is at fixed save stations (which are placed fairly close to each other so it's not that bad), but all of this successfully leads to one end - not cheapening the creature. Alien is terrifying, it's constantly there, stalking you, trying to pinpoint your exact location and to kill you. You'll feel that most of encounters with it are close, and that you are always one wrong step from dying. While it is, in reality, a lot more forgiving than that, the feeling of paranoia is always there, scratching at the back of your head.\n\nAll of this is backed up by a decent storyline and solid writing, with fantastic music, graphic and sound design. While some bits of the game feel a bit padded, it generally manages to make you feel like its always quite fresh (I don't want to spoil anything so I'm not going to reveal how exactly), and while the game is quite long, it feels captivating enough to make me finish it. The game takes good care to pace itself properly - the first time you even get to see the alien is about 1,5 hours into it\n\nAll in all, Alien: Isolation is the best survival horror game I have played in a very long time, possibly since Dead Space, and this time, it places emphasis on the 'survival' bit. It's beautifully put together, very well crafted and it's such an innovative gaming experience that I'm pondering on making it my GOTY of 2014. Well worth your money, well worth playing.","January 10, 2015","true","28.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

I have to say after the Aliens Colonial Marines "saga" I was not expecting much from this game at all, we have had it all before, a dev blustering on about their amazing aliens game only to discover it was a steaming pile of dog crap... yeah we know the story...\n\nThis game in a nut shell is not any of those negative things.  Creative assembly have done the series justice with this amazing game, and it is amazing, the graphics look good and the music score is second to none its  really amazing how the music and sounds thicken the atmosphere so much that it can have you nervous and your heart pounding in your chest before the alien has even appeared, you genuinely feel in danger the entire time and it can get quite unnerving at time which for an Alien game is perfect.\n\nThe Alien creature is just absurdly good... it stalks you for most of the game and even when it isn't on the same level as you, you can hear it scratching and clattering around the ducting searching and listening for its next victim, you will find yourself skulking from locker to wall to under a bed or behind a table praying that it doesn't see you for if it does?  Game over man... Game over.\n\nA wide range of tools are available however to aid you in surviving, throwing flares and various crafted items to confuse and distract your would be killer into giving you a few more precious seconds to grab that key card or punch in that door code before it realises where you are.\n\nI won't go into many details about the various levels however they explore a wide range of the Alien universe and you get a taste of everything with this game... it is never the same from mission to mission and it mixes it up just enough to keep you nervous and paranoid of the next calamity to be headed your way.\n\nThe game is single player only so fans of coop or other multi player games might not find what they want here, however for single player story rich fans like myself this game was fantastic, and as well as being fantastic it is BIG, I clocked in 18 hours on my first play through and to be honest I wasn't exploring as much as I wanted because I was just to paranoid the alien was going to catch me.  Lots of replay value here between the survivor modes and just the sheer fun of playing through again, or hunting for collectables missed in a previous run etc. it will keep you coming back for more.\n\nThe only thing that was a negative for me, is that I would have liked a little more interaction with some off the other characters in the game, they are not in it for much and as much as I wouldn't have wanted escort missions (it simply wouldn't have worked with that alien running around) it would have been great to at least interact with them more further than required static cut scenes.\n\nMy rating of this game is 9.5/10 I love it that much, and I hope any future DLC we get is of equal quality.  I also hope SEGA let this team create further Alien games because the love they have for the franchise is oozing from ever single bulkhead in this game.","October 12, 2014","true","71.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/recommended/214490/","freelancer799","Freelancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/","1054 products in account","The Alien franchise has long been a fan favorite but not very often has it translated to games all that well. There are a few outliers however most of the Alien games have been atrocious and just didn’t bring the feel of the movies to the games, looking at you Colonial Marines. This is pretty strange because in the instance of the first two movies, Alien and Aliens, you have two vastly different movies; one horror and one action. You would think that developers could pull off one of the two. However besides AVP (1, 2 and 2009) this really hasn’t been done. Alien Isolation however attempts to bring the feel of the first movie in which Amanda Ripley is trying to survive on the ship without truly being able to kill the Alien.\nAlien Isolation takes what made the first movie great and made it into a game. It is a Survival Horror game with a few shooter elements. Now this isn’t to say you can shoot and kill the Alien, oh no, this only angers said Alien (unless you are using fire). The shooter elements are mainly meant for the synthetics and the other scavenging humans on the station. Being as it is, this game being a survival horror, the objective is to get to where you need to go and not be caught by the Xenomorph (woo Alien terminology), synthetics and humans. You have various tools at your disposal that allow you to accomplish this including flares and noisemakers but for the most part the best way to avoid detection is to be careful and time your movements well while crouch walking. I think my biggest problem with this gameplay is that all this ends up being is just slow careful timing to avoid detection. Now Monolith threw a little wrench in this plan because they made the Xenomorph’s AI a little random. It never takes the same path and can return a second later after it left the room you are in. It can decide to stay in the vents and wait for you to pass one where it can grab you, wait to hear something or it could stay on the ground and search room to room and each locker inside. Church, our other reviewer, found that the Alien found him far too often despite him being completely quiet. However every instance of it finding me was thanks to my own fault; making noise or being too close to the front of the locker (you can move around in a locker and hold your breath too). The beautiful thing with the Alien’s random behavior is your path has to always change to your goal. I’ve had instances where I had to take several vents instead of the hallways just to avoid him but I’ve also had instances where he would get me inside the vents as well which means the motion tracker you get is your best friend.\n\nNow I mentioned earlier that you have different devices (including your fireball magic) that you have access to in order to help you out. Most of these items including the Molotov, Noisemaker, Medkits, EMP bomb and others can be crafted by materials you find throughout the game however you can only hold so many. On top of that you gain five weapons that can help kill the humans and synthetics or ward off/anger the Alien. You eventually get the revolver, shotgun, stun baton, bolt gun (this is REALLY effective versus synthetics) and the flamethrower which is extremely effective scaring the Xenomorph off. With these weapons however there comes problems with using them. If you use one of the projectile weapons within ear range of the Alien, it will come to attack whatever made that sound. If you end up using the Molotov or Flamethrower too much then the Alien will be less frightened of it and will tackle you as it flees causing half damage.\n\nIn Alien Isolation you play as Amanda Ripley, Ellen Ripley’s daughter. It is set about 15 years after the events of Alien where Amanda is working with Weyland-Yutani in the hopes of finding out more about what happened to her mom. During all this a station called Sevastopol got in hold of the Nostromo’s (Ellen Ripley’s ship) flight recorder and Weyland-Yutani send Nina Taylor and Amanda Ripley to go get it from them. When they get there they noticed something is very wrong with the station. While doing a cable walk in space to get to the station there ends up being an explosion which separates Ripley from the two others that were with her. As she makes her way through the ship she ends up discovering that there is some sort of creature on board that is killing people and on top of that the Synthetics are killing humans and the humans are killing everyone else in order to survive. As it turns out a ship called the Anesidora was the ship that found the Nostromo’s flight recorder but while following the ship’s flight path they come to LV-426 which had the Alien eggs on the crashed ship. While investigating the ship one of the crew of the Anesidora gets attacked by a facehugger and it hatches on Sevastopol while getting medical aid. All during the game Ripley is trying to get into contact with the ship she was brought on in order to escape the station while trying to discover what happened to the Nostromo and Sevastopol. One of the best things about this story is the pacing and how fluid the game is. Not once do you feel like you are repeating things and the slow flow of the story is very much like how it was in the original movie. In Alien (film) you don’t even seen the Xenomorph until an hour or so into the film and the same could be said about the game as I didn’t encounter it until about an hour or two into it.\n\nNow the graphics in this game are incredible but what really makes the graphics is the aesthetics or how close this game replicates the feel of the original movie. The hallways, the motion tracker, the rooms, doors, the station, even the Xenomorph itself are to the letter of the original movies and for fans of the series you’ll be in nostalgia overload. The game despite releasing in 2014 has the exact sense of being an old 80’s Sci-Fi. On top of that the set pieces are all beautiful and so well done. Alien isolation also has some of the best fire I’ve ever seen in a game which is quite impressive; that flamethrower is so satisfying. The particle effects are also incredible in that the lights will blink through the smoke and look incredible.\nOn top of the graphics this is probably the best sound effects I’ve ever heard in a game. Now any game that claims to be a survival horror needs to have great sound effects but every little sound in this game are so well done. Monolith matched the sound effects from the original movies so well that I felt like at times I was just watching the movies instead of playing (this doesn’t mean that the framerate was a “cinematic” 30 fps). The siren sounds, motion tracker, the Alien’s sounds and even the synthetics dying all sound amazing and Monolith should really be given a lot of credit for how well they did in this respect. Even the music does well to replicate the movies. It has that edgy feel where the music will suddenly get louder or it will play those quick reverberating notes that you hear all too often in Alien and Aliens.\nNow screenshots can’t really illustrate how well they did so here is a video of me playing a bit; WARNING the first 10 seconds have spoilers:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI3qJ_eEVHg\n\nOverall this game is an incredible homage to the Alien franchise and is up there for best game so far this year. The gameplay is quite solid albeit sometimes random and frustrating. The flow of the story and events is great and doesn’t feel like you have to do any minute tasks. The graphics and aesthetics are so well done and the sound and music is some of the best I’ve ever heard in a game. My only real complaint is that despite the game being fun I can’t really play it over again without knowing exactly what is going to happen. There are small DLC that expand the game further and the survival mode is a fun test of skills but the main campaign can really only be played once.\n\nFinal Score: 8.8","October 15, 2014","true","22.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I just finished my first playthrough, took me around 20 hours, and it was a rewarding experience. You can tell there was a lot of work put into the game, from game mechanics, level design, graphics, sounds, everything up to the smallest detail. The alien looks and behaves perfectly, every time i restarted he was in a different place which adds value to what your next move will be.\n\nI know people have been giving this game all kinds or reviews, saying its too long and repetitive, the aliens moves being predictable etc. but i found none of those things to be entirely accurate. The missions need to create the environment where you will be alone for a while to experience the atmosphere fitting of the alien hunting you. Also the alien was everything but predictable, you can even get killed from the ceiling vent without seeing him. And certain levels will simply leave you speechless.\n\nPositive:\n- breathtaking graphics and level design\n- great music and soundeffects\n- inteligent alien that actually provokes the feel of insecurity and helplessness wherever you go\n- the game perfectly balances tension in different parts of the game so you arent just being chased all the time\n- challenging game difficulty forcing you to use different methods and think twice before you make your move\n- a lot of eastereggs and awesome scenes that remind you of the original Alien film\n- game lenght, yes i definitely wouldnt want this to last just 2-3 hours, dont know why people complain about this\n\nNegative:\n- disappointing ending for my taste, hopefully there will be a DLC to continue the story\n- the price! (50 euro)\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you ever wondered whether there will be a game that can restore the dignity of Alien based games after that horrendous A:CM, wait no longer. This is the game for you, and if youre an Alien fan its a must have.

Just like basically every review has stated the design is right out of the 70's futurism aesthetic. It looks so much like it was designed in the same world as the Nostromo it's not even funny. The lighting is probably the best part of it. Whether it's a dark area that's only punctuated by the light from some monitors or an area with a swinging bulb (or even better, the Alien coming out of a ceiling vent and knocking a lighting fixture with its tail). Creative Assembly's use of lighting is simply remarkable.\n\nGameplay wise I'm reminded of a cross between Thief (the original) and System Shock 2. Like SS2 the Sevastopol is the primary character you interact with. Most of the time you're simply there; nothing but you, the station and the various terminals, speakers and stuff around you. When you do come across other people (or androids) most of the time it's time to hide and avoid them. There are some characters that you come across that aren't going to simply kill you but they're the exception.\n\nStealth is old-school. There's no light crystal, no indicator where enemies are on the map, no sound-level indicator. It's all eyes-up and ears-open. And it works. Being aware of where your enemies are, listening for their conversations, footsteps and other telltale signs of their presence is how you stay out of sight. Human and android enemies appear to have a fixed patrol route (at least the ones that move) so by observing them from a place of safety you can plot out an avoidance scheme. You also have some tools that you can build to help you. Noisemakers will draw enemies that hear them over, flares might (haven't really tried) draw attention and there are a few weapons as well if you really need to get into a fight. Ripley can only take a few hits (and healing takes time) so it's far better to avoid fighting whenever you can.\n\nInteracting with the various systems on the station also take time. It's about two seconds from when you first trigger the interaction to when you can actually use the system. It also takes a couple of seconds from when you stop interacting with the system until you're back in control and able to move. I've seen complaints about that but that's what really makes being aware of your enemies important. If you can't simply hop onto a rewire terminal to trigger an alarm in an area of the map that you're not in so it will draw the enemies away it makes you consider if that's the best strategy.\n\nSaving is another area that I've seen complaints. The game autosaves at each level start but there are no other autosaves. To save you have to find a terminal, insert your ID card, wait three seconds for the card to be read and then you can save. These terminals are frequent but not everywhere. You can save at any time you come across a terminal but you're not going to be given terminals for every room or corridor. This forces you to keep aware and ready to react. Usually I'm not keen on limiting saving (saving usually should be controlled by the player with autosaves occurring when the developer feels like it) but in this case the save system is so integrated with the game that it feels like it would cheapen the difficulty of the stealth by allowing the player to save anywhere. Instead I find myself always asking "Is it worth it to head into a risky situation that I don't have to in the hope of finding something useful?" as well as planning my way through the maps with the locations of save terminals influencing that path.\n\nAs for the Alien... it's a mixed bag. It appears that the Alien can be in one of three modes regarding the map area you're in: not present, stalking or active. When the Alien's not present you basically have free roam (presuming no human or other enemies are present) and noise isn't an issue. I cannot state for certain that there's no risk of the Alien showing up if you make a lot of noise but I've been in one firefight (well, I was shooting and the android was dying.) and never heard the telltale signs that the Alien was approaching.\n\nWhen the Alien is stalking it's in the walls/vents/ceiling. You hear it moving around and it will take up sentry at certain places (like ceiling vents) and attack anything that moves near it. They provide enough indications that the Alien is present that it doesn't seem unfair if you walk into it's trap. Again, I can't state unequivocally that it won't come out if you make a lot of noise, but I haven't had it do so.\n\nWhen the Alien is active it's in the map with you, moving around and hunting. Unlike the humans it doesn't have a set patrol route, though it does appear to have preferred locations. In one area there's a large central room with doors on two ends and windows on the sides. The Alien liked to stay around that room, presumably, because it could see pretty much every part of the area. Hiding isn't win-mode either. If the Alien sees you hide: you're dead. If it sees you go into a room and then doesn't see you in the room it will begin searching potential hiding spots. There's no guarantee that it will find you (and there's a breath-hold mechanic that helps you avoid detection) but I still had a couple of times where it found me with no real indication as to what gave me away.\n\nSneaking past the Alien is an exercise in patience, timing, distraction strategy and pathing. Finding the shortest path between your goals will often help you avoid the Alien by simply not being exposed very much. Sometimes this means not exploring very much, using vents or avoiding redundant paths (like corridor loops). A well timed (and aimed) noisemaker has so far been the most useful in getting past the Alien when it's hunting around a choke point but you can only carry three (and only enough resources to make three more at any given time) so care must be taken when choosing to use one.\n\nUltimately the biggest problem with the Alien (so far) is that it's only ever in one of those three modes. It simply doesn't make much sense for the Alien to come running (entering active mode) for some sounds and not others or to respond to a triggered noise, search the area and not find anything and then not head off looking for elsewhere. It takes a lot of the tension out of the game once you realize that if you see the Alien you know that you're simply going to have to avoid it. If the Alien had the potential to show up at any noise and leave at any time (i.e. model it's behavior as always stalking the entire station) then the tension would easily stay high. As it is, it doesn't feel much more tense (most of the time) than any given level in the original Thief. You're tense because you know that if you make a mistake you'll be squished but not because you don't know when the Alien might appear.\n\nUltimately the Alien's AI does make the game flawed. I don't think it's as bad as some of the reviews stated though. I paid $40 for it and am not regretting it. I don't think I'd regret it at $50 either. I do hope it sells enough that Creative Assembly can take a stab at a sequel. I think they've got all of the components right except for the Alien. Repeating everything that's good and focusing on improving the Alien could make a sequel as much a refinement as Thief 2 was over Thief.\n\n9/10","October 14, 2014","true","38.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

But don't let it sway you from what I'm about to say just because I love Aliens. As of now I've got 4 Hours under my belt for this game. I'm only on level three. And I'm horrified. I literally shake when I hear the Alien crawling around in the vents. Prime example. Gotta distract the Alien to advance. I think ill shoot the pistol. Grab its attention, bypass and be home free. I shoot, I hide in a locker. The alien climbs out of the vent closest to me (by the way the animations are so god damn nice its borderline life like) and I stay there for 10 minutes crying because I can't hear it anymore but I know its close. So I decide to get out where I fumble with the reload, start putting the rounds into the cylinder of the pistol when I hear this huge thud behind me and its hiss, not even a meter away from me. I stay still for like 10 seconds when I slowly turn around and then it pounced. Creating this truly terrifying animation where I had to pause the game and revert save as it was too much. This is the first game to have ever made me feel this scared in all of my life and has truly set the bar for new horror games.\n\nCA have made a beautiful organism which it truly deserved, as said before, it could have just pounced and got it over with. But instead, it knew it had me, so it was basically just toying with its food. That's what really scared me. The fact that in the 10 seconds I was just praying for it to get it over with, it didn't. It just decided for me to either run or to turn to look at it. CA have made this creature have a fantastic AI which is fantastic\n\nThe game just oozes atmosphere. You don't even see the Alien for 2 levels. Its only till the end of the 2nd mid 3rd you actually see it. But I was still jumping at every hissing pipe, vent noises. Anything which could have been the alien.\n\nBottom line is. This game is truly a great example of what gaming can make you feel. CA have done a brilliant job and this is what should have been made first. Not Aliens: CM\n\nBravo CA you have done a brilliant job.","October 9, 2014","true","7.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rigpardy/recommended/214490/","rigpardy","Rig Pardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rigpardy/","287 products in account","It's terrible...ly close to beeing the best Alien game I have ever played.\n\nAfter Colonial Marines I kinda gave up hope that there will be a single decent game of the Alien franchise coming out, ever. But... After the first few trailers rose, and the focus on developing a game in a way so it carries the spirit of the first (and my favourite) Alien (1979) movie inside, proving it to be a terrifying experience aboard a space station, where no one can hear you scream.\n\nAnd indeed, SEGA, or Creative Assembly, to be more precise, delivered. Alien: Isolation takes the formula of current Indie-Horror games, mostly referred to as Closet Simulators, as there is no way to defend yourself other than to run away and hide, and turns it into a diverse gameplaysetting, set in one of the oldest Sci-Fi Franchises there is. At first, I thought this would become like Amnesia, only with an Alien, but instead, it actually had more gameplay than just puzzle solving and hiding.\n\nIn AI, you can craft utilities that you can use to distract the alien, humans, or synthetics in order to progress. You even get 4 Weapons + Melee weapon to use against your foes, while fighting the alien is a bad idea in general, but blowing some hostile survivors or pesky synthetics a big load of lead into their head is actually quite fun. Especially when you use the utilities to first distract them, then get from behind and smash their skull.\n\nCombat is really diverse in this game, as there are 3 types of enemies. The humans and synthetics are pretty alike, whereas the humans use long-range guns and pumpguns, and the working Joes rather get up close and personal. Often you need to change tactics when battling one, after fighting the others, as an upfront smash to the head will do nothing against synthetics, except for you getting killed.\nThe alien on the other hand... You CAN shoot it, but only the pumpgun has some sort of effect, which makes the alien hesitate for a moment before charging at you. Using the flame thrower, or a molotov though makes the alien retreat into an air duct for a short period of time, enough for you to escape and find a safe place to hide.\n\nThe story is okay, it sure has some twists and turns you could've predicted beforehand, but it lives up to it's movie counterpart, the original Alien movie, but I don't like to spoil anything here.\n\nVisually this game is impressive. It runs smooth, has lots of lighting effects, very crystal clear textures and models, as well as decent shaders. The only thing you might criticise is the lack of proper Anti-Aliasing. It features FXAA and SMAA up to SMAA 2TX, but it really only does mostly nothing. You might want to use forced AA, or even try Downsampling for this game instead.\n\nThe Sound design is really good! Awesome so to say, most of the sounds at terminals, ships or similar stations are close to the soundsets of the original Alien, especially using a terminal gives you this good ol' classy 70s Style vibe. Especially the sounds of the Alien impressed me. Hearing it stomp around near you really terrifies you, when you can't see it right there, or the way it hisses when it's stalking you, waiting for a chance to grab you from above.\nSame goes for the Soundtrack. I even recognized Tracks, or parts of ambient tracks that were taken from the Original movie (or remade for this game), which really emphasized the passion the devs had for the first Alien movie.\n\nIn conclusion: Alien Isolation is the Alien game I wished for so lang. It takes the terror and desperation of the original movie, puts modern survival horror and stealth into the mix and stirs it right up, adding fan-service here and there and presents itself in front of you, terrifying, yet irresistable and addicting. This game is the best Horror-Survival I've played since two generations. Great Job CA, you exceeded my expectations.\n\n9/10","October 13, 2014","true","29.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/otakud/recommended/214490/","otakud","OtakuD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/otakud/","621 products in account","Alien: Isolation was the best survival "horror" game I've played since Dead Space, why the horror in quotes you may ask? While the xenomorph certainly is scary and menacing at the start, you will slowly start to learn each and every piece of it's arsenal and how to manipulate it to your advantage. This knowledge will diminish the scare factor to a certain degree but that is not to say that you won't be on the edge of your seat, you certainly will, though I do feel the survival aspects are far stronger here. That being said the game does a good job at mixing things up throughout, keeping you busy even when the alien isn't around and always keeping you in the dark as to what will happen next.\n\nThe plot is possibly not it's strongest point but still plays out in a way which feels parallel to the original Alien movie, but always making sure that you feel like a part of the action. One scene in particular was so nostalgic that I just had to explore every inch of it, and exploring a 3D replica with such high detail was a sheer delight. That attention to detail carries through to almost every aspect of the game as well, each set piece is oozing with atmosphere and feels so masterfully crafted that you could be forgiven for thinking Ridley Scott constructed it himself, and I guess in a way he did since so much respect was clearly given to the source material.\n\nDealing with the complaints of the games "length" I would have to say that, while it may have benefited from a slight trim, I didn't feel it ruined the experience at all. Often a lull is necessary to help the sense of dread reestablish itself, in this case I think we will know more once we see the sequel. Overall the time I had with Alien: Isolation was out of this world, and I certainly recommend it to any fan of the Alien universe.","October 14, 2014","true","28.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/berserk-smurf/recommended/214490/","berserk-smurf","Berserk Smurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/berserk-smurf/","199 products in account","Alien: Isolation is atmospheric, beautifully crafted, challenging, and paced like the film Alien, with the long slow build-up, the exciting baptism of fire, levelling up to a stressful, tense atmosphere of peril that you almost just want to escape, all the way to the end. From my perspective as a big fan of Alien, I cannot recommend it enough.\n\n\nI'd recommend any enthusiastic fan of the franchise to buy this game, even if you might have trouble doing the full 15 hours of the campaign, it is worth it to experience the incredible realisation of Ridley's universe - there has never been a game that does so as faithfully. I recommend playing the game on hard - it will punish you for your audacity, and areas will take time to get through, but this is the difficulty setting that places you in the richly "on-edge" mindset of watching the film for the first time.\n\nThere is a checkpoint/savepoint system, and for me personally this is usually a big negative point - but it is worked into the game mechanics so well as to add to the general tension-bed atmos - if you (like me) consider save points a thing of misery and evil that work contrary to enjoyment, you might not need to worry so much in this game - you can be killed while you use one, making them a potentially risky action that improves, yes *improves* gameplay, as bizarre as it sounds.\n\nThe experience does its job well, so far. Soundscape, environment, narrative, and antagonist all seem to be competently done and come together to put you in the world of an Alien story. Even what seems like the weaker things the game (for instance, Working Joes) actually work quite well in reality. This is probably the best Alien game, and to give you an idea of where to place it, it is at least as good as the classic AvP outing - I know, it's difficult to believe until you play it. It's reminiscent of very old games in its gameplay, like ancient cat and mouse games, or being chased by a grue through several dungeons - consequently while it won't win awards for complexity the basis is sound and enjoyable.\n\nAn important caveat is that I expect the tense stealth/crafting gameplay gets boring towards the end for most people, but there isn't much you can do about that, it is a 15-35 hour long survival horror, it's a triumph of good design to get you past 10 hours in this genre. I would honestly say that if you only lasted 6 or 7 hours and are an Alien fan, you would get more than your money's worth just walking in this incredible, beautiful, sumptuous immersion in Ridley's universe - the experience of getting headphones on and walking down the corridors of that world for a few hours, that's something that's hard to put a price on, and for once as fans we catch a break, because it is actually as special as it should be.\n\n\n\nIt is nothing like A:CM. It is not much like AvP 2010 except for the few moments of shock/apprehension that game does kind of OK. Isolation does both (shock and apprehension) masterfully.\n\nIn terms of quality and atmosphere, Isolation has more in common with the decent old Aliens versus Predator gameplay on PC/Atari Jaguar, DooM III, System Shock and the first F.E.A.R. game, if someone dropped you in them without any way of credibly fighting - and the creature is as close to Ridley Scott's Alien as it is possible to get, no closer than I thought it possible to get, in a game where full frontal views of the Alien are going to happen all of the time. Left to try and survive that eight foot terror with little more than duck tape and prayers, it seems about as "scary" as you could want a game to be.","October 8, 2014","true","34.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Terrifying.\n\nThese are just some of the words to describe this fantastic game. If you are a fan of the Alien films you owe it to yourself to play......no, EXPERIENCE this game. That's right, you don't just merely play this game, you experience it. Right from the onset, you can feel the love and dedication that was put into this game by the people at Creative Assembly. They are huge fans of the Alien franchise, and it shows. As I played through it, there were times I actually teared up a bit because this is the Alien game I've always wanted since I was a kid. I had always dreamed about a game like the first Alien movie where you get to feel what Ellen Ripley felt and the fear that she experienced in the Nostromo. Well this game IS that game. (Hell, if you buy the DLC "Last Survivor" you actually get to be Ellen Ripley and replay the first movie's climax! It's well worth the $3.99, believe me.)\n\nI gotta warn you though, this game will terrify you. It is a genuinely scary game. Not just because of the alien itself, but also because of the androids (which have gone crazy) that are scattered about the space station you are on. Some people I've talked to have even said that the androids scared them more than the alien, and I can definitely see why.\n\nSo thank you Creative Assembly for making this game. It was a pleasure to play. Never in my life had I ever had so much fun being so scared. For me, this was the game of the year for 2014. If this game was an apology for the travesty that was "Aliens: Colonial Marines" then it is one hell of an apology!\n\nI should also mention that this game is amazingly optimized for the PC. My computer is ancient (i3-2100, GTX 650 Ti Boost, 6 gigs of RAM, 1440 x 900 monitor) and this game ran perfectly on it on mostly all the highest graphical settings with a solid 60 FPS all the way through.

And smart!\n☺Huge amount of Weapons which you will collect throughout the game\n☺Complete crafting system\n☺Sound track is understated and atmostpheric. Think DeadSpace 1, but with drums.\n☺Fantastic graphics. GREAT PORT.\n\nThe Bad ☹The Alien's behavior can sometimes feel more preternatural than through evolution, and borders on              omniscience at times.\n☹Bit too much focus on combat and gun play. Though all of it's solid. Working Joes get repetitive.\n☹Somewhat unfair Save system which will become a chore quickly.\n\nWorth Noting Tough for new players who havn't understoof the fundamental rule: RESPECT THE ALIEN!\nThis thing will not tolerate you running around, and trampling around its toes. This go's for everyone else on the station. The alien is hunting whatever is finds, not just you. You can use this to your advantage.\nComing into contact with the Xenomorph is instant death, and a trip back to the loading screen. Dont let it see you.\n\nStory is pretty good. The absurd attention to detail in terms of the references to the Alien franchise as a whole is insane. Creative Assembly have crafted a loveletter to the Alien community who appriciate this attention to detail. I myself am not one of those people, but I can appriciate the fantastic art assets, aesthetics, and the design and posing of the Alien itself is masterfully done.\n\nThe Graphics are very solid. Lighting effects all work realistically. Sparks and the glow of emergency lights all create great atmosphere. The Alien looks fantasic. Cant say enough about how cool it is. The game is an obvious port from current gen consoles. There is barely any difference from the Xbox pne/PS4 to the PC, which some may find dissapointing. The up side is that this is a really reeeeally good port. It will run on virtually anything. I've testing this on a gtx 780 and a 550 ti, and the latter can easilly mantain 60 fps, if you're willing to start switching through menus and tweaking a few things.\n\nThe length of the game is also something that should be adressed. This game is LOOONNNG. Most will have no issue with this as they will see it as more for their money. However it could be argued it slowly starts to outstay it's welcome around 2/3's of the way through. I'd average the normal players playthrough would be around 20 hours long, and this is without dying a huge amount. This game will go on, and on, and on.\n\nUnlike some other horror games which Isolation seems to have taken tips from, such as Outlast and Amnesia; there is quite a lot of combat in this game. The main enemys that you will face, apart from the constant threat of the Alien, are Automaton androids called 'Working Joes'. These little buggers will head right for you and attempt to break you in two if it can get it's hands on you. There are also survivors around the station. Most of them are hostile and will attempt to blow you away if they see you.\nCombat starts off great. As most of the time you will not be able to fight the things set against you, and will be forced to hide. Half way through the game you will be given certain weapons that can keep the Alien at bay, if not kill it untirely.\nWorking Joe's can be killed early, but most weapons are ineffective. Joe's will soak up bullets, blows, and just about anything. Kinda like the Terminator.\n\n\nThe Verdict\nPersonal Rating:  Essential buy to Stealth and horror fans alike\nTraditional Rating: 9/10","January 18, 2015","true","19.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/214490/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Warning: this review contains spoilers for a movie that was released 35 years ago!\n\nAlien: Isolation is set on the space station Sevastopol 15 years after the events of the film Alien. You play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, the protagonist of the aforementioned film. A search party is sent out to the Sevastopol with Amanda on board after word gets out that the flight recorder from the Nostromo (her mother’s ship) has been located aboard. On their approach to the space station, Amanda is separated from her crew and you must investigate the Sevastopol on your lonesome in an effort to both finish your mission and find your team.\n\nThe Sevastopol Station is rich with atmosphere and based heavily on the design of the first Alien movie. The crippled station will lurch and rumble, suffering through collisions and system malfunctions. Aesthetics from the movie are preserved with a retro sci-fi design and padded walls. You may walk down a corridor, enveloped by flashing lights and klaxon alarms, only to react at the faintest sound or shadow. Or you may admire the reflections on the floor before receiving a telltale blip from your motion tracker. The atmosphere is perfect for the Alien threat and the retro design is a refreshing change from the sterile modern approach to sci-fi. The chunky keyboards, phone receivers, distorted CRT monitors, and blinking coloured lights should look dated, but it has quite the opposite effect. This is a tactile, practical, and convincing science-fiction world, with machines and environments that are functional and utilitarian, rather than overtly futuristic. You almost feel like you can reach out and touch it. As a result, in terms of consistency, vision, and thoughtful design, it’s the most visually striking game world since Deus Ex: Human Revolution.\n\nBut a sci-fi corridor, no matter how pretty it is, isn’t much without something horrifying to chase you down it. So it’s a good thing that Isolation is the first game—and it’s amazing it’s taken this long—to make H.R. Giger’s alien every bit as formidable and intimidating as it is in the films. In Alien, Ripley asks Ash how they can kill the creature that burst from Kane’s chest aboard the Nostromo, and he replies, gravely, “You can’t.” This, unlike the dumb drones you blasted your way through in Colonial Marines, is also true of Sevastopol’s alien. It’s a merciless, unstoppable force. “A perfect organism.” You can shoot it, but it’ll just get angry and pounce at you. You can burn it, but that’ll only scare it away for a few seconds. Isolation’s magic lies in the fact that you have to outsmart its single alien rather than kill it. This turns what could have easily been yet another FPS with xenomorphs into a thrilling, drawn-out game of cat-and-mouse with the scariest cat imaginable. It’s a deft blend of stealth and survival horror that, thanks to dynamic AI and clever, systemic design, is much more than the sum of its parts.\n\nYou'll know when the alien is near. As you creep through the station, you hear it above and below you, behind the walls, under the floor. You're relatively safe when it's hidden away like this, but you never know what vent, crack, or hole in the ceiling it'll suddenly emerge from. It arrives with a beastly hiss—a sound that becomes your cue to hide or run. Then you hear the pounding of its footsteps as it wanders the corridors, hunting for its prey. It's a massive, heavy thing that towers over Ripley, and if it sees her it lunges with a shriek, killing her instantly in a grisly, cinematic death sequence.\n\nThe alien is an almost constant threat, but there are other dangers on Sevastopol. Malfunctioning androids called Working Joes wander the station, brutally killing any humans they come across. Their rubbery, emotionless faces and glowing eyes are genuinely unnerving, and sneaking through groups of them is as nerve-racking as facing the alien. Get too close and they'll grab you, draining your health until you manage to break free. You can kill them, but they take a lot of resources to bring down, making stealth the best option. They're a lot slower than the alien, but every bit as deadly. Then there are other survivors. You'll run into them less often than the alien and the synthetics, and they're a lot easier to kill, but they usually work in groups. They won't shoot on sight, and will give you a few seconds to back away if you wander into their territory, but it doesn't take much to send them into a frenzy of gunfire. Luckily, if they shoot at you, the noise will attract the alien and it'll kill them all. This is often the best way to get past human enemies: provoke them, then wait for the bloodbath.\n\nWhichever enemy you're up against, sneaking is always the key to survival. You'll pick up a shotgun, a revolver, and a few other weapons as you progress through the station, but they're more of a curse than a blessing. For one, they're only really effective against humans. It takes a dozen headshots with the revolver to drop a Working Joe, and the alien is essentially bulletproof. But the biggest problem is that, the instant you fire any weapon, the alien will come rushing to your location and slaughter you. The motion tracker, a series staple, will give you a rough idea of where enemies are, but they'll be drawn to its bleeps if you're too close.\n\nThe good news is that Sevastopol isn't short of places to hide. There are lockers and cabinets to cower in, vents to escape through, and desks to crouch under. You'll spend much of the game creeping silently and methodically between objectives. This might sound dull on paper, but the presence of the alien makes almost every moment exhilaratingly tense. Encounters with the alien are not scripted. Its behaviour is unpredictable, and the impressive, reactive AI creates the illusion that it's an intelligent creature. You really feel like you're being hunted as it moves from room to room, tracking your movements, sniffing you out. But as smart as it is, there are ways to exploit and confuse it. You can easily throw a noisemaker at a group of humans, and the alien will come out of hiding and slaughter them all, clearing your path for you once it leaves. Ripley had a strangely intimate relationship with the aliens she faces in the films, and I felt the same thing happening to me in Isolation.\n\nBut now for the weak link. The story is disappointing, retelling a familiar yarn we've already heard countless times in the Alien universe: sinister corporations, murderous androids, rogue AI, and others I can't talk about because of spoilers. The good thing about this is that it lets you relive classic Alien moments and experience them from a more visceral perspective. The bad is that it feels derivative, never taking the opportunity to make its own mark on the mythology. Really, though, the story is just a means of getting you from place to place, and in that sense it doesn't matter that it's lightweight. It's ultimately the journey and the moment-to-moment experiences that define the game, not the overall narrative.\n\nIt's ridiculous that it took the developers of a historical RTS to finally create an authentic Alien game, but The Creative Assembly have managed it. They've succeeded where countless others have failed by treating Giger's monster with the reverence it deserves: as something to be feared and respected, not faced head-on with a pulse rifle.

When you enter you soon realise that there is an Alien aboard which is killing everyone. You have to try to escape or trap the Alien while figering out what happend.\n\n+ The grathics are great. They look amazing and give a great atmosphere thoughout the game. Not one point did the game look rushed, you can really tell the the developers really enjoyed working on the game. One small problem would be the anti aliasing which could be better. You probaby wont notice.\n\n+ The storys a very creative and diffrent, the first half feels and works great but towards the end it can get tiresome. The main reason why would be becasue you have to backtrack more than once which leaves you feeling like you want to see more of the ship.\n\n+ The controls are spot on and I have no problem with them, if you did then you can change the keys to your liking or you can play with a controller as they have supported them.\n\n+ Music in Alien: Isolation is perfect since they remastered the original soundtrack from the movie Alien. Because of this the game feels alot like the film with fans will love.\n\n+ The difficulty is how most games should be. Not many save points which means you really dont want to die and the game is always challanging.\n\n+ The AI is the best I have ever seen in any game, well for the Alien. The Alien learns your tactics and roams freely which means you can never predict what/were the Alien is. This is great since the game will always feel diffrent every time you play. The humans are good but not as good as the Alien.\n\n+ length of the game is around 15 hours, but is can be alot more depending on how you play. If you run around and dont look around your surroundings you will finish alot quicker than if you looked around and walked slowly. Really depends on how you play games.\n\n+ Threre are some replayability to be had such as achievements and timed missions which are fun. There is some DLC you could buy if you want to play more missions.\n\n+ The voice acting is fits well and they even voiced actors from the movie which is great. It makes you feel like your playing a Alien game.\n\n- The only downside if a few tiny things... These are Story backtracking, anti aliasing and the game models/lip syncing is bad. They are very tiny to added up together they could have been fixed in development. They hardly do anything to the game which is good.\n\nOverall I think that Alien: Isolation is an amazing horror game which is taken back to it's roots. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes horror, Aliens. I rate Alien: Isolation 9 out of 10!","January 13, 2015","true","26.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pornstorestiffi/recommended/214490/","pornstorestiffi","Meier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pornstorestiffi/","403 products in account","Warning, these are my personal opinions on the game. And in this case they are very negative opinions. If you read this and love the game, keep loving the game. I do not hold that against you. It is an Alien game most will love.\n\nI had high hopes for it, and maybe thats why im left here with more negative things to say about it than i have positive.\n\nThe beginning of the game is very slow, the first hour is basically a slow build up learning you the controls and the mechanics of the game, of which there aren’t very many. The control mappings are fine on both keyboard and controller. However the feel of motion is sluggish, sort of like you are moving through molasses, even your run feels kind of awkward and too slow.\n\nYou will be represented with a space station to walk around, where you will carry out many tedious tasks. Which often revolve around the same things, like powering up sub-systems, finding a keycard, finding a new tool that will let you open a new set of doors, and a ton of backtracking. In Between those segments, you pretty much play a hide and seek game, combined with a walking simulator.\n\nYou will come across other humans in that time, but it usually always ends in a gunfight if they spot you. As it seems no one are interested in working together or just letting you walk by with no hassle. You do have the option to bypass or let the Alien sort them out.\n\nThen there are the androids, which are equally as hostile and are best bypassed altogether if possible, as it takes a metric snot ton of bullets to take them out. And don't even try to wrench them they will grab you each time, unless you manage to sneak up on them and get some good shots in. Again androids best avoided.\n\nAnd finally there is the Alien(s), the center piece or at least it should have been.  I thought it would have a big impact on the game. I was kind of wrong about that one. It doesn't really add any tension to the game, at least it didn’t for me. Maybe because it showed up so much, seeing it over and over makes you accustomed to it and unafraid of it. Plus you will know what to expect and what to do each time.\n\nIt really added an annoyance in the fact that it would make me have to wait to carry out my mission to an extent it actually added a comical value too, the AI on it is kind of stupid. Sometimes it would actually see me, but it will be stuck in its hide in vent animation, and wouldn’t be able to break that cycle.\n\nThen there is the issue of even though you will be crouching most of this game, the Alien oddly have the ability to just keep on you at all times, even though you left it in another room like 2 meters back, it will and can emerge just as you enter a new room like all the way in the back of the next room. This even happen when you transit from one part of the station to another. Like it has its own personal teleportation device, or maybe its just psychic?\n\nThe save system is just like the one found in say Dead Space. Though in Dead Space it actually worked without any issues. Here it seems to only serve the purpose of adding additional down time for more opportunities to get attacked and to interrupt your save. You can literally die before you manage to save, as there is no backing out of the save animation.\n\nTo save you need to find a save station, wait for the terminal to light up 3 lights, which takes around 5 seconds. And then you can hit the save button. It feels very archaic, and i get why some people are frustrated with it. Especially if they have lost 30 minutes of play time and have to backtrack. While in the meantime the Alien AI can completely hump you over again. I know that the game would lose difficulty if you could just quick save, but it's kind of appalling that you can get a cut scene and you would think that the game automatically would save your game after the cut scene ends. But it doesn’t. I’m actually still not sure when the game saves by it self.\n\nThis is a game you either love or loathe. I count myself as a big Alien fan, love the movies and i have watched them so many times. That doesn't mean that i have to give this game a pass though. It has flaws, and for me it has a lot of them.\n\nOn a positive note, the graphics are really awesome. They nailed the look of the movies, down to the smallest details. Sound design is for the most part really good aswell. There is a few minor things like not all voice actors are very good, and that the motion tracker is not using the iconic sound from the movies. But overall in the sound and graphics department its pretty damn solid. It is a bit of a shame though that really good set pieces only happen when you are over halfway through the game. There are some really striking locations near the end of the game.\n\nI would only recommend this if you wouldn’t mind any of the negative things i have listed above and a few random deaths on top of that.\n\nSelf proclaimed Alien elitists will be happy with anything, i mean those people love Alien: Colonial Marines and find no faults with it. So if you are one of those go for it, nothing will change your view on it in the first place.\n\nBottom line for me, i regret buying it. And i regret writing all this nonsense.\n","October 11, 2014","false","15.0"," 208 of 391 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","208","391","5","21"

This catches the time of the first movie with its 1979 Sci-fi look, and the music is always nailing it at all times.  The atmosphere is the most impressive I have ever seen in an Alien game, and is the best so far hands down.  I've played horror games before, and because of the predictable AI I felt that there was no challange even on the toughest difficulty.  Since the Xenomorph has a none scripted, unpredictable AI I felt like I have found my match, I hid under a desk, it went by, and once I got out, it had turned around and therefore I was in its sights and I got mauled.  Though you may still be a little unsure about this game because of IGN, Gamespot, or other reviewers who reviewed it very badly, just to let you know, this is a very, very good game.  The IGN reviewer as I remember said to have the game on it's easiest difficulty.  Well don't go by his word, as he probably thought that this was a CoD game, and I think that the reviewer on Gamespot got kind of confused and thought it was a straight on action game. (although it can be but there's a huge risk of getting nomed by the alien)  But I implore you all to do the game on the hardest difficulty, because this came from Gary Napper (lead designer) that the meat of the game is learning what the alien is capable of, and that is true.  The levels are extremely well made, and you (and even the alien, other people, and androids) have multiple routes to take.  I've never been so scared by a game like this in a long, long time, and if it can get my heart racing, then it is a great, true horror game.  So if you want the crap scared out of you, then Alien: Isolation is the best one you can get. And another thing, this is around 15 hours or more to complete, so you'll be scared longer than any other game which is great.  If this review has helped you decide to buy this game and you enjoyed it, then leave a thumbs up.  Thank you for reading, and stay safe from getting your skull chewed on by the alien, Peace.","October 8, 2014","true","4.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Fans of Alien will be delighted at the look, feel and sound of the game, because Creative Assembly have nailed it.\n\nMe, I'm not hugely into my horror games, but I do love my xenomorphs. This game scares me. It scares me like the Hammer Haunts from the original Thief scared me when I was a child. Thje xenomorph is animated beautifully, and I swear it really learns your tactics. You simply can't keep hiding in cupbords, it'll get wise to your act and just rip them open. It's cunning, it's too fast to outrun, and it just can't be hurt by any of the weapons you get. At best you can scare it off for a few seconds with a flamethrower, or distract it with a jury-rigged decoy. It's the best depiction of a xenomorph in any game yet. The Working Joe synths are just the creepiest things, with their dead rubber faces and glowing eyes and unfriendly corporate soundbites that sound really threatening. They might be scarier than the xenomorph.\n\nThe mechanics are't terribly innovative, if you've played most survival horror games. You creep, you run, you hide in vents or lockers or under tables, nothing fancy, but all done smoothly and with crisp response and feedback. The crafting system is basic, but that's a good thing because the crafting menu doesn't pause the game, and you really don't want to be distracted by complex recepies. It's perfectly servicable.\n\nBest xenomorph game since AvP, and that was more based off Aliens and its endless swarm stuff. There's only one Alien in this, and it's hunting you, and you can't kill it. This is very much the xenomorph from the Nostromo.\n\nExcellent game, hugely atmospheric and immersive, and bloody scary when it wants to be, which is most of the time. You should get it.","October 8, 2014","true","14.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/recommended/214490/","LordWeh","Lord Weh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/","344 products in account","Alien: Isolation sticks closer to the first film of the Alien franchise; the xenomorph is a slick and fearsome monster, and you have to crawl your way across a giant spacestation hoping it never finds you.\n\nThe stealth mechanics are simple but intuitive, the presence of 'lean' buttons show the game's focus on stealth over combat. You spend the majority of the game armed with nothing more powerful than a small, ineffective pistol and a wrench, rummaging through desks and shelves for supplies to cobble together distractions and equipment to help keep you alive. There are a variety of enemies you must (try not to) face; bands of desperate humans who are scavenging supplies themselves and trying to survive on the failing station, the station's servitor synthetics that have malfunctioned in the deadliest way, and the titular alien, who stalks the decks of Sevastopol Station.\n\nI should admit straight up that I had to switch the game down to Novice difficulty to complete it, to the game's credit. The enemies feel alert and threatening, on the standard settings they hunt you down if you slip up, and the xenomorph simply kills you in a split second. Whilst many stealth-based games give you a feeling of empowerment from the shadows (Thief / Splinter Cell / Dishonored), Alien: Isolation leaves you shaking inside lockers and under desks, not daring to check your motion tracker in case the sound alerts your foes.\n\nThe story is very much what you'd expect from an Alien game that focuses on stealth. I can't say I was particularly surprised or shocked at any moment, but the narrative was still engaging enough that I was pulled through the game and wanted to know the resolution. The game is perhaps a little overlong, with sometimes random obstacles popping up to extend some sections; once you have a keycard for a door, the power suddenly goes and you must sneak back across the map to restart the power to use the key, for example, but the mechanics of play work so well these don't feel terrible.\n\nEarly into my playthrough I likened the game to System Shock 2, although whilst System Shock 2 gradually gave you more and more access to the ship, Alien: Isolation is content to put you into small sandboxes. There are moments where it could be possible to go somewhere you're not required and backtrack a little, but I never backtracked much personally. You do visit most areas a couple of times as required by the plot. Generally you're moved into small to medium-sized sandboxes with an objective, you pick a path to it, then problems and monsters get in the way and you have to adapt. Also, if you die and reload, it moves the enemies around so you don't know where they are, which is terrifying!\n\nThe save system keeps the tension high, you cannot save where you like, but must punch a card into an 'emergency station' in order to save progress. This takes about 8 seconds or so, overwrites your previous save, and you are immobile whilst doing so. If you've not seen one of these save points for a while you feel all the more invested in being careful, and then the motion tracker starts to beep...\nSome dislike this save system but I felt it worked effectively, mechanically adding an interesting twist to keep tension high.\n\nI feel that the aesthetics of the game really deserve a strong mention, the game gets a thumbs up for the visual style alone. This game is more faithful to the style of the original film than some of the sequels and Prometheus. This is a future as imagined in the 80's, and the flickering film grain on the intro screen says it all. There are VHS tracking lines on communication videos, chromatic abberation pops up all over the place, even the 'sets' of the levels are full of tickertape printers and punch-card computers, the aesthetic design is nothing short of amazing. Sound also plays a key factor, several elements scream 'Alien' and these are doubly effective as you sneak about, with rising orchestral sounds adding to the tension. The sound of xenomorph itself is terrifying (and yes, whilst the alien in the films is slick and stealthy, the heavy padding of the xenomorph here sells it as a heavy and monstrous engine of destruction as you quiver under a desk).\n\nOverall, an awesome game that sticks to the vision of the original film, a little overlong with a fairly predictable story, but a worthwhile experience none-the-less if you have the nerves for it.","January 21, 2015","true","22.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

I've never been too fond of the horror genre yet I was able to complete this game in an exciting 25 hours.\nThis game is very much related to the films, you play as Amanda Ripley (Ellen Ripley's daughter). You start off on The Torrens. After finding out that a flight recorder left by Amanda's mum is on another ship nearby called Sevastapol, Amanda feels the need to find out what happened to her.\nEllen Ripley was on a ship called the Nostromo years ago, and Amanda's 'space buddies' join her to find out about the ship, presumably knowing that there was an unknown species (duh alien) on the Nostromo.\nUnsuprisingly, you find out that there are aliens breeding and feeding on Sevestapol.\n\nThroughout the game you continuously complete intense missions, helping you find out more and more about Amanda's mum, yet somehow it quickly turns into a survival/stealth game in which you attempt to stop the 'one' alien.\nThis game heavily requires patience as you stealth past androids, armed humans and the alien.\n\nI give this game a solid 9/10 due to its beautiful graphics, atmosphere and ablility to make a game interesting and fun for a whole 20 hours at least.\nThe remaining 10% goes to the game becoming slightly predictable and the occasional glitch of an alien seeing you when it shouldn't kind of thing.\n\nIf anyone asks me to recommend them a game, I would most definitely recommend this game.","July 26, 2015","true","38.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

What it really is, is the most accomplished and sophisticated of the first person horror games released so far.\n\nI'm a big fan of Penumbra: Overture and Black Plague, I very much enjoyed Amnesia too. They came along when first person and adventure games were becoming quite stale, so I'll always be very fond of them. I played them with relish and love them for incepting a whole genre, essentially. But they were far from flawless. Likewise the Bioshock franchise, which has many positive qualities, also lacks somewhat. It fails to recreate the sense of tension System Shock 2 had, and it also fails to create a realistic sense of place in its game levels. Atmospheric as Rapture is, it only vaguely felt like a city, and much more specifically like a dungeon for you to kill people in.\n\nThe reason these games are relevant to this review is because Alien: Isolation recreates them mechanically almost blow for blow. A crafting system not unlike that found in Bioshock exists here, but it's far stripped back, Being lean and always useful but never overpowering you or giving you a too great sense of confidence, in contrast to Bioshocks items and abilities systems which always were, quite frankly, bloated. I initially ignored the system, as I do most crafting systems, be cause they usually ARE ignorable distractions from playing the main game. But here, medpacks, molotovs, noisemakers and all kinds of other junk you can make save you a world of trouble, and you quickly learn to pay attention to the little side areas that contain treasure troves of crafting materials and ammo.\n\nFurther, Alien: Isolation is imbued with an aesthetic sense far finer than its inspirations. Dialogue and story, especially at the crucial opening act of the game, are subtle, well measured, realistic and feel quite human. Most commendable is Amanda Ripley herself, who functions perfectly as the voice of the player. She never just accepts the bizarrely violent  world on board the station as the half-mute protagonists of Bioshock usually do, and demands explanations from word go. Such a feature is crucial because it allows the player to accept the in-universe situation as an emotional one, not just one with mechanical obstacles and story as pretense for it.\n\nThis subtle, detail oriented mentality extends to the visuals of the game. Art direction is not just slavishly devoted to the design patterns used for the environments in the original Alien, but also to creating a sense of humanity. Environments are scaled to human use, stuffed with normal human rubbish (candy bars, cokes, pens, papers, the fodder of workstations) and their layouts are logical in the sense of their utility first (a medical centre is planned out just like a medical centre should be), not in the service of gameplay, a mistake both Bioshock and the Frictional games make.\n\nAnd that's the secret to Alien: Isolation. I enjoyed this game immensely. Not because it showed me something new, but because it showed how taking something that's already popular and done well, then adding the extra 10% of love and thought, creates much more than just 10% more fun, it can give a game a reason to be remembered for being more than just "the best of the three good games amongst dozens of mediocrity that were produced for X movie franchise".","January 7, 2015","true","22.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Environments are scaled to human use, stuffed with normal human rubbish (candy bars, cokes, pens, papers, the fodder of workstations) and their layouts are logical in the sense of their utility first (a medical centre is planned out just like a medical centre should be), not in the service of gameplay, a mistake both Bioshock and the Frictional games make.\n\nAnd that's the secret to Alien: Isolation. I enjoyed this game immensely. Not because it showed me something new, but because it showed how taking something that's already popular and done well, then adding the extra 10% of love and thought, creates much more than just 10% more fun, it can give a game a reason to be remembered for being more than just "the best of the three good games amongst dozens of mediocrity that were produced for X movie franchise".","January 7, 2015","true","22.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

As a fan of the first two Alien films, this game was amazing to play.\n\n+Recreates the setting of the first film to a tee.\n+Challenging survival horror stealth gameplay (best played on Hard, trust me)\n+Surprisingly smart alien A.I. that adapts to your playstyle\n+Scary without relying on jump scares like so many others in the genre. Fear is built up naturally and the constant threat of the alien builds great tension.\n+Well paced, with down time to break up the alien parts\n+Working Joes are an interesting take on Alien synthetics and deserve to be canon\n+Graphically stunning. Lighting is amazing.\n+Sound design is some of the best I’ve experienced. Headphones are a must.\n+Amazing fan service (not the XXX kind), one scene in particular being breathtaking\n+Long campaign that gives your money’s worth (almost 30 hours on hardest difficulty)\n+DLC is good and fair\n-Story is not its strong point.\n-Anti-aliasing is pretty bad for some reason\n-Some deaths were predictable. Even though it’s an Alien game, too many people died.\n-Flamethrower felt overpowered towards the end as ammo was too common\n-Horribly unsatisfying ending\n\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like to be on a spaceship and hide from a xenomorph? Well, Alien: Isolation serves as the perfect simulator for that. I was very hyped for this game when it came out and I am so thankful that Isolation delivered. This game is perfect for me as I love both stealth games and the Alien series. Contrasting from most modern AAA games, Isolation refuses any handholding and instead requires you to learn on your own. One of my most memorable moments was when I sat in a locker with my motion tracker out, hiding from the Xenomorph. It walked in front of the locker, then suddenly pried open the door and devoured me. At that moment I realized that the xeno could hear the tracker, and I ended up relying on the tracker far less throughout the game, to a point where it almost felt as a burden to pull out that beeping machine. As someone who is often cynical towards things that claim to be “scary”, I can honestly that Alien: Isolation is definitely scary. This is no mainstream pretender like Slender or Paranormal Activity, this is legitimately scary. Isolation is a kind of stealth game where you are almost never safe. In the early game, I relied heavily on moving through vents because, foolishly, I thought it was safe. The A.I. must have picked up on this as it started to check by vents more frequently. Eventually it started moving in the vents itself, and hearing those footsteps while in those cramped metal pathways was horrifying. Unlike so many other stealth titles where enemies feel preprogrammed, the xenomorph in Isolation feels like a living breathing enemy out to get you. Its paths don’t feel scripted but also don’t feel random, making all of its movements seem like they have purpose, and that purpose is obvious. It truly feels like it is out to get you, as opposed to the standard stealth foe that walks in distinct lines and has obvious cones of vision. If you’re into that kind of thing, Isolation offers the average stealth gameplay through the Working Joes, robots that are going haywire System Shock style and are also out to get you. I liked the addition of these as it kept the game feeling familiar and gave a good change of pace from the difficult xenomorph sections. Even with all that stealth, Isolation understands that hiding from enemies can be tiresome, so there are down time sections where you simply walk around to do basic tasks. That may seem boring but it actually functions as a good refresher so that the game isn’t just all tension all the time. With all of my compliments to Isolation’s gameplay and horror, I do have gripes with its story. Amanda Ripley is a great character in her own right, and any concerns of her being a lazy ripoff of Ellen were thrown away. However, her relationships with her teammates are not explored much and frankly most of the people outside of Amanda feel boring. When a key person dies and I don’t feel much, then you know your game did a poor job at creating characters. My greatest complaint goes towards the game’s ending. If you know Alien lore, then you know what happens to Ellen (go rewatch Aliens if you want to know). After the many hours I put into getting away from the xenomorph, I was hoping to finally find some peace and quiet for Ellen Ripley, but unfortunately the game gives us a somewhat ambiguous and unsatisfying ending to such a long story. There lies another issue: the game felt too long. I know, that might sound strange in a medium where games are often scolded for being too short. Isolation on the other hand is one of the few examples of games that dragged on too long. The story is filled with many “oh wait” moments, where you think your struggle against the xeno is finished only to find that it is still a threat. While this is in line with the franchise’s fashion, it can get tiresome especially with how long the game turned out to be. While I prefer a game to be too long than too short, the Isolation developers tried a bit too hard in putting things into their game. I appreciate the efforts they put into making this game but they did overdo themselves a bit.\n\nWow, this turned out to be a pretty lengthy review but that's because I have so much to say about this wonderful game. At the end of the day, this is a game that was evidently made by Alien fans for Alien fans. Even if you aren’t big on the franchise, buy this game if you enjoy stealth gameplay or are just wanting a good scare.","July 11, 2015","true","45.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phenom820/recommended/214490/","phenom820","Fjurg van der Ploeg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phenom820/","141 products in account","I honestly can't believe how much I find myself intrigued by this game. Truthfully, it recreates the 1979 Alien scenery beautifully and the developers also wraps this gorgeous lollipop with another sugar coating just to make sure, by having some great, innovative and fun elements.\nThe first few things that I noticed instantly that I absolutely adored:\nThe environment, the overall high-quality textures and the precise attention-to-detail. There are so many things that makes you believe that you're back in time. I know I was born 1996 and therefore cannot know how it exactly was back then, but judging by the movies and pictures, it's kind of obvious to me that Creative Assembly indeed did their homework here. They made me wanting to explore Sevastopol, they make me want to go through the story and listen to the Archive Logs, Nostromo Logs, etc. Well worth a strong 9/10 in this department\n\nThe feeling of fear and despair. What I noticed after playing through this game was that the Xenomorph truly is invincible. The question ultimately lands on one's hands, asking whether or not you're willing to pay the ultimate price to defeat God. Speaking of an ultimate price, I want to have a say about the ending in this review, and I'll come to this opinion later on. With this point - to sum it up - I was trying to get across to you of the feelings you get when playing this game. You will fear enemies (esp. the Alien itself) and you will "need to change pants after a session of Alien: Isolation", so to speak. This, my dear fellows, is an indication of a great, great game; the ability to rouse the player and pump you full of emotion(s). It deserves nothing but a 10/10 here\n\nThe combinations of the equipment and the surroundings. This was pretty cool, actually. A few times during the game, you had to evade both hostile humans as well as the Xenomorph in a stealthy manner. But instead of just throwing a rock here and then moving on-type of gameplay, you can use your equipment and engineering-background (Amanda Ripley is an engineer) to create more adventurous situations: you can, for example, when you see a group of humans, use the noisemaker to cause the Alien to kill the scavengers and give you the opportunity to explore the area you once was not able to. And this is just one example. You can use molotovs to cause the Alien's interest in you to recess. So I loved this part, to be honest. I think that a fair 7/10 is due\nThese are titanic positives, and most certainly enough for me to say "Purchase this game. It's worth it." but there are a few things that I found to be missed opportunities, downfalls or just plain and simple bad choices from the creators.\nProbably my biggest irritation with this game: why is Sevastopol portrayed like the behemoth of a space station that it is, yet there are barely any "good people" or more places to fully explore? Why are there no quests? This is a big thing that I wish to see in Alien: Isolation 2, I guess.. quests. If a game is big enough (like this game actually is!!!) you can add quests and a lot more people/groups/locations. When you've finished the prologue you can actually skip the missions and go exploring, with the Xenomorph on your tail, naturally, but yet there are no side-missions to complete. See it this way: It's sort of like Fallout 4 but without the ability to complete missions or interact with people. If Creative Assembly takes this approach to the sequel, they'll create a great game that you could easily spend hundreds of hours within. Have it made into a survival horror with some RPG elements. I understand that it's Alien and it NEEDS to stay true to its origins and roots, but this would truly be interesting.\n\nThe story is fantastic, but I wish I could do more than just "do this/that for us and then come back"-sort of thing. There were some missions that were stellar and let us actually do some interesting things, but there was a great proportion of "dull" missions as well. This is something to remember, especially considering that this game is single-player only. Yes, it's supposed to be related to Alien, but it's still a game and you're allowed to have some room for creativity.\n\nThe DLC's are rather dull. It's like a time trial and nothing else. It lets you play as one of the crew members from the original Alien movie, which is absolutely fun, don't get me wrong, but there's no real meat on the bone, if you catch my drift. It's not more Alien: Isolation, but just a puny "something small on the side"-type of DLC. It's definitely worth it on a sale if you're a hardcore fan of the movie franchise but it's nothing I would buy for myself knowing I wanted to play more Alien because of the story.\n\nDiversity of various things. When you need light, you start generators. When you need to move an object electronically, you pull a lever. When you need to hack a terminal, you play a mini-game. Please, for the sequel, take this criticism and spend more time on it. I want further ways of being involved in the game. Can't I just shoot at the thing and open X or use my engineering skills to alter electronic-circuits to access information Y? This would be amazing and truly a fresh breath of air. But then again, implementing is a whole other story.\n\nLast but not least.. the ending. This is not really a negative gameplay point, but I still want to mention it. !THERE ARE NO SPOILERS! I feel as if the ending opened a new set of questions, rather than answering the ones created during the actual playthrough. Did Amanda truly get closure? What happened to her - does the ending indicate something deeper? Is Weyland-Yutani reacting in a certain way? Etc., etc. I feel as if it's unfinished but still finished in the sense that they're planning for a sequel coming soon. It would not surprise me and I will pre-order it as soon as it becomes possible.\n\nCONCLUSIONIs there really a perfect game? Not truly. If there was, wouldn't it be relative? Yes, it would. And thus perfection is what the fans of the Alien-universe will receive. I am a fan of stealthy games and especially horror games (and movies) and since you can't truly use action and stupid Call of Duty-tactics through this game, I was very much pleased - if you're this type of person as well - you will also be pleased, I'm sure of it.\n\nYes, it has some limitations, but there is one person who reviewed this game here on Steam who said it wonderfully: this game is not really a game - it's an experience. And that is spot on. It's an experience no other game can truly deliver. It's scarier than anything I've played and I feared for Amanda's life as if it was my own; It's difficult and the AI does not disappoint (besides occasional natural bugs, of course). Do I recommend it? I do. Do I reommend it during a sale? I most certainly do.","February 9","true","14.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Rather than modernising the setting, Isolation takes the player back to that late-70s early-80s Scifi setting with fantastic attention to detail. Everything looks utterly faithful to the source material and on the whole the environments are very engaging, encouraging exploration and immersion.\n\nSound is also fantastic in this game, especially the sound effects. Every single sound you hear is great and couldn't really be done any better in this setting. Audio factors into gameplay, with subtle audio cues betraying the presence of an enemy. The sound and music really helps the immersion, especially when you consider how great the voice acting is too. The sound and the graphics make Isolation one immersive and atmospheric game.\n\nThe gameplay of Isolation is comparable to the Penumbra series, asking the player to navigate various environments solving all kinds of objectives whilst avoiding death from some various hazards and opponents. True to the name, Alien: Isolation features a single Xenomorph and it is utterly unkillable. The player can craft or find some distractions and even weapons, but flames and bullets will only scare your fearsome foe away temporarily. The alien will return. It always returns! Like most horror games the experience is much more tense if the fear of death is heightened, so I highly reccomend players put Isolation on hard difficulty.\n\nAlthough I haven't beaten the game yet, reviewers claim the game is very long with IGN hilariously claiming it's TOO long. On top of this the game has a 'Survival' mode that puts you in a smaller map with a single objective to be completed against even more difficult enemies. More missions will no doubt be released as DLC.\n\nThe Verdict: A fantastic atmospheric horror game and a glorious return to form for Aliens videogames.","October 6, 2014","true","13.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

"Wow... Not even seen an alien yet" and wouldnt you know it... That is when he appears.\n\nUnfolding his sleak frame and appearing to be a true killer you finally get to meet the star of the game.   The AI is exceptional with him reacting to sounds very quickly.  He also likes to stalk you a bit... much the same way a predator in nature would stalk you this AI does the same.   Chosing at times the path you do not really expect him to take and doing so damn fast.\n\nHaving a ton of fun and would say that this is definately a MUST HAVE title for any fan of Aliens.\n\nJust make sure you bring a change of underwear.","October 14, 2014","true","17.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I grew up loving the Alien movies and this game was an awesome homage and add on to the story of the original.\nAlthough this game scored higher postive review scores than negative ones, I was confused about some of the gamer complaints....."It's too hard. I have to hide all the time. " I'm not sure what mode they played it on, but I played it on normal and had a f****** blast! This is by far the best "Alien" game out of the many disasters and the only one people should play.\n\nPROS:\n*GORGEOUS graphics and attention to detail (I wondered around for hours just reading posted notes attached to desks)\n*Amanda Riply is a fantastic lead character, who for once said MANY of the things I was thinking when I have played similar "fix-and-fetch" quests. For example: "Why is this ship a piece of ♥♥♥♥?" "WHy don't you go fix the power reactor?" "Why are you all so worthless at fixing ANYTHING?!" I chuckled several times.\n*The gadgets you can make are pretty cool and not just "balls-to-the-walls" machine guns and grenande launchers. You have to rely on stealth.\n*The Working Joe androids were scarier than the Alien itself. The little things they mutter to themselves and to others are f****** creepy.\n*The DLC "Crew Expendable" and "Lone Survivor" are great because they allow you to play actual characters from the original Alien story. These are short, but sweet.\n\nCONS:\nAlthough I probably loved everything about this game there was one CON that I agreed with when reading the other gamer/critic reviews.\nThe game play is consistent and the story line awesome, but it reaches a  point around hour 16 when you REALLY think the game is going to wrap up and finish and then........it continues for another four hours. This is not necessarily a bad thing because you are having fun, but it needs to be trimmed down. Not only that, I found the final four hours of the entire game to be the only times I became frustrated.","January 1, 2015","true","24.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Heart pounding! Even before I saw the Alien for the first time, the music score alone had me in a panic thinking the creature was right behind me as I waited for an elevator. And when I finally saw the creature I was wishing to be back on the level before I saw it. Panic would set in as you would hide from this creature as it stalked you. The telltail THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! of its footsteps as it roamed the halls looking for its next victim. THAT DARN HISSING AND GROWLING IT WOULD MAKE! And as you hide from it, sometimes with very little cover, your heart will start pumping and that fight or flight feeling will come over you. And then ..... It STOPS RIGHT NEXT TO YOU AS IF TO TURN AND OUNCE ON YOU! and you think it's  GAME OVER MAN GAME OVER! then it walks off.....Leaving you catching your breath. Oh and did I mention I'm not far along in this game? LOL I highly recommend playing this game in the dark by yourself.

Lives up to everything promised. Clearly this team actually does love and cherrish the source material. I have absolutely no regrets about preordering. Only problems were some occasional model clipping, but thats to be expected in any game. The game ran almost perfectly. I did have some crashes and bugs, but that was only related to one specific enemy. I do not wish to say which specific enemy caused these bugs because spoilers, but it wasnt the Xenomorph, Androids, or the Humans. I was quite surprised at the number of weapons in the game, shotgun and pistol to name a few. The Xenomorph is smart and can't die, but on easy difficulty becomes more of a minor inconvience once you get your hand on the flamethrower. I wish I could give it a rating higher than 10/10, but sadly thats impossible, no matter how many other reviewers say 11/10.","October 6, 2014","true","14.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostWriterBF4/recommended/214490/","GhostWriterBF4","GhostWriter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GhostWriterBF4/","103 products in account","Gameplay:You may hear about the fact that the second half of the game has some "issues", but I did not find this to be as bad as others may lead you to believe.\n\nThe build up to the first enemy encounter is done very well. It doesn't just throw you into the action (which would make you too comfortable with the enemies). Up to Mission 10, your encounters with the alien will be reminiscent of Amnesia. You won't have very effective deterrents and you will need to hide a lot. Sometimes the Alien will pin down your location and begin to take a relatively repetitive pattern. In these situations you need to use a Pipe Bomb, Noisemaker, Molotov and possibly the Flare to disrupt it and escape.\n\nA lot of the complaints you will hear come from Missions 11 and 12. At this point you will already have the Flamethrower and you will receive an excessive amount of supplies while fighting the relatively easy to beat Working Joes. I don't agree with people's complaints here. These missions make you begin to feel comfortable and make you let your guard down. (Personally, I thought it was nice to take a sort of intermission and enjoy the atmosphere for a few levels.) Then in Mission #13 you are thrown into an area with Raincoat Working Joes (invulnerable to everything except the Shotgun and Bolt Gun). This brings the difficulty level back up, but it's arguably less intense because they do not insta-kill.\n\nFor the last five Missions of the game, you will be thrown back into the intense Alien Survival Horror gameplay, but this time you will really need the items you collected through the last few levels. This last segment of the game is a blend of Survival Horror and Action. It fits well at this point due to the amount of different enemies you have to deal with.\n\nI honestly enjoyed the change of pace after Missions 3 - 10. The Survival Horror style gameplay, admittedly, can get long and tedious. I don't mind the game stepping back from that style at times (rather than trying to be absolutely 100% non-stop Amnesia, which would have been increasingly repetitive for a game of this length).\n\nThose who want more of that Survival Horror style gameplay should look at the Corporate Lockdown, Safe Haven, and Lost Contact DLC.\n\nIn summary, you should expect (in this order):\n2 Missions of simply eerie atmosphere.\n6 Missions with a healthy amount of Survival Horror.\n1 Mission of back story that Alien fans should enjoy.\n3 Missions of respite from the Survival Horror, replaced with Action elements.\n5 Missions of Survival Horror, but with some Action blended in due to an excess of items (depending on how much you have collected through the game) and more enemies.\n\n\nGraphics:They do not disappoint. Particle effects, lighting, and textures all looked great. My only complaint is some of the 3rd person character animations looked a bit “uncomfortable”.\n\nThere are several .ini edits that can be done to enhance Shadow Maps, Planar Reflections (floor), and Level of Detail. See here[forums.alienisolation.com] and here.\n\nLength:It took me about 26 hours to beat on Hard.\n\nAtmosphere:This game has all the creepiness and retro-futuristic feel of  Alien, but with the added uncertainty of a large derelict space-station built and run by an off-brand corporation. Great attention to detail was taken to make everything, including the UI, have an authentic Alien Franchise feel to it.\n\nOptimization:The game ran constantly well above 60FPS on Max Settings (with enhanced Shadows, Reflections and LOD. See "Graphics") on a GTX 970 G1 and i5 4690K @ 4.4ghz. I had no frame drops or any noticeable performance problems.\n\nOther thoughts:The voice acting done for Amanda Ripley was wonderfully done. You can hear the fear, sarcasm, and bravery in her voice depending on the circumstance. At points where events get very intense, the panic in her voice is noticeable and authentic.\n\nSimilar to Bioshock, there are recordings scattered around through the levels. Many of these add to the story at just the right time, but some of them are just filler.\n\nThe majority of the game has a “wild ride” style story (survival through non-stop adversity and such), but I found the ending to be weak. It is reminiscent to the ending of  the film “All is Lost”, except not executed nearly as well.\n\nThe music has complements the game well, playing dynamically at just the right times. It ranges from high-tension strings, to space synth scores.\n\nFinal Verdict:I thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish. The gameplay does change as the game progresses, but I found it to be for the better. The theme and atmosphere of the game are executed well.\n\nI give it a 9/10\n\nBug Notes:Slow animations after cut-scenes.\nSolution: Wait for about 30 seconds and it should return to normal.\nFlamethrower  constantly play a "sloshing" noise after reloading.\nSolution: ADS usually fixes it.\nSignificantly longer load times than usual.\nSolution: Load a previous save. This only happened to me once. I believe this to be a save corruption issue.","September 9, 2015","true","26.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

Although you can choose many different paths/options, the story sticks to a script.

The story without going into details, is set between Alien, and Aliens as you take the helm as Ellen Ripley's daughter, Amanda as she is now searching for clues as to the whereabouts of her mother.....\n\nPros     Story works well as a whole.\nVery well optimised, lighting and the graphics look amazing, SLI friendly.\nAlien's AI has that "Oh you clever girl" moments, I recommend your first playthough on hard, with a headset.\nSynthetics are downright creepy.\nAn array of weapons and homemade gadgets to utilize.\nStealth works effectively, the Motion Tracker™ will troll you from time to time.....\nMini-hacking games are immersive, keeps you on edge.\nSoundtrack throughout is brilliant, especially the ending credits.\nDecent campaign, 20 somethin' hrs on hard for 1st playthrough.Cons     Checkpoints and save points can be unforgiving on occasions.\nThe game's antialising is a little poor, although Sweet FX can remedy this.\nThe Alien kills you outright if seen, can be fustrating at times....\nThe Flamethower overshadows much of the game's craftable gadgets.\nVoice/lip syncing issues which breaks immersion alittle.\nEnd Thoughts\nWith the few problems this game has with checkpoint/save pacing and other little annoying issues, it doesn't out weigh the pros, which it's got to be the best Aliens game in quite a while...And lets face it, it's alot less nausea inducing hiding in lockers than it is playing as an Alien in AvP, so you can trade from feeling sick to sh*tting yourself in this game, it's a win-win!

Lightning, textures - just everything so neat designed and the whole game looks like a movie.\nBut it doesn't only look like a movie, it also SOUNDS like one. The soundtrack is top notch and really fuels up the atmosphere of the game.\nThe STORY and GAMEPLAY are going well hand in hand, and everything just fits. Its all about surviving in a lethal surrounding. Although most of the objectives are just "Go from A to B and do C", but the game covers that up pretty good - simply because it lives of its great atmosphere.\n\nMy PERSONAL OPINION on this game is that every genre-fan should have it in their librarys. Is it a good horror game? Yes - although you get used to the all-time present threat, its still a nonending thrill throughout the whole game. Is it a good game overall? Definitely yes! It looks, sounds and feels great, tells a good story and throws you into memorable experience. Unfortunatelly it doesn't completly live up to my rule of thumb - 1 gamehour per 1$ spend. For 50$ you get about 15 hours on the first playthrough and about 10 more hours for achievment-hunters and on top of that a survival gamemode which adds even more replay-value.\nOne more thing that really bothered me: In the beginning of the game you get so many great looking cutscenes, which i really enjoyed, but later on in the game there are almost no cutscenes. Whould've been rad to see some of the emotions on Ripley's face, not only hear them in her voice - shame.","January 25","true","27.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I'm very lucky that I was convinced by a random internet commenter to give it a second chance, and that my white-knuckled, pontificating rage at a particular early level (the Medical Ward) was not an uncommon reaction to that questionably-designed section of the game. The dissatisfaction I felt when I realized your main antagonist, the eponymous alien, is designed to stay within a certain radius of you when you crawl a football field away from it in total silence made me feel smart and sophisticated as a long-time survival horror buff, but when I returned to see the game through, I came to the paradigm-shattering conclusion that sometimes current, and major, design studios can still get things extremely right.\n\nOn that first go, I quickly surmised that the plot is mostly phoned-in. And to a degree, I stand by that--the whole thing isn't much more than a sure-to-please rehash of the first Alien movie, but it does serve as a wealth of opportunity to internalize that film's impact by enabling you to live and breathe the carnivorous, soaring agony of having the odds stacked so high against you. Like Ellen Ripley, you might find yourself staring down the acid-drizzling xenomorph in the room, moving as slow as you can to your objective, humming quietly to keep yourself cool. It takes a lot of nerve and a fair bit of cunning to stay alive.\n\nI don't want to get too psychoanalytical when talking about this game (though it does strike me as a powerful duplication of the Silent Hill 3 package--in which a woman has to navigate an openly hostile male-dominated environment and is hunted, relentlessly, by psychosexual terror and betrayed by just about everyone [there, I said it]), but the effort that went into generating this specific flavor of all-out dread is simply marvellous to see these days.\n\nThe atmosphere. My god, it's a thing of beauty. I never expected anyone to let me crawl around inside and rewire the hissing, crackling retrofuturist systems of a doomed space colony as envisioned in the late 1970s. Pipes are bursting, analogue computers are clacking and spinning reels of tape, and you can hear the station's skeleton moan as it falls from orbit around a looming gas giant. That vibe trickles all the way down to the oily, decaying, blue-collar details of the hellscape that you traverse, and you get a very tactile feel for these environments and the engineering obstacles you encounter--you click both mouse buttons to clamp onto a bolt with your maintenance jack, then hold down the corresponding WASD key to break the bolt loose. Your security tuner sings a little chiptune melody while it warms up, and you can damn-near feel that the thing is a mostly-hollow hunk of low-memory plastic when you hear its buttons and notched dial click as you hack through a door. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -love- the attention given to the gadgetry.\n\nThe gameplay is like a linear Metroid Prime-via-Amnesia-♥♥♥-Bioshock, but the experience borders on exhaustingly tense most of that time thanks to its near-constant cat-and-mouse dynamic. You're being hunted, and you sure don't get a lot of down-time from this anarchic safari. Exploration is encouraged, but only if you've got the stomach to put up with something banging around inside the air ducts above and below nearly every step of the way. I was very happy bypassing most of the collectible lore, and closing those damn elevator doors behind me. Fast.\n\nDespite my grown-up impatience with its overarching familiarity, with its too-rote tropes (psychotic panic-babble scribbled on walls does not interactive storytelling make) and manipulative scripted events, I was able to get absolutely lost in it the further I went. With luck, an emergent gameplay moment will occasionally surpise the ♥♥♥♥ right out of you. Once, while hiding from the alien as it dropped into a hallway outside an operating room, I looked over to find a random NPC crouched behind a turned-over table, shaking and thumbing his revolver, every bit as desperate as I was to stay out of sight. I had a chance to either knock him out and save his life, or keep him conscious to serve as a live distraction so I could slip away. That was when I really learned what this game is, and I felt extremely grateful I had reneged on writing it off.","January 22","true","20.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You have to adapt and change to outsmart it.\nSeegson Working Joe's are a brilliant addition to the story and are believable rudimentary androids.\nHorrifying footsteps, screeches and noise in the vents really makes you crap your pants.\nLong campaign. You get your money's worth.\nCons:Experienced one bugged save file late in the campaign meant I had to restore a previous save. Hopefully not a regular occurrence for others.\nSomewhat linear storyline. Although you can choose many different paths/options, the story sticks to a script.

I was really surprised that its creators are Creative Assembly that make Total War games. First (?) attempt at stealth horror and such terrific success.\n\nStory, characters, acting, everything is top notch. It's too bad these developers aren't making System Shock 3 right now, they would make a masterpiece. This is basically a System Shock like game, but one of the enemies you encounter is unkillable. Remove this, and you'll get a perfect System Shock sequel, a 'thinking man's shooter' instead of a horror game, like 'Aliens' was an action movie after 'Alien' horror. Anyway, if you like System Shock classics, you'll enjoy this one - loads of hacking, engineering, system overrides, audio logs, androids, complex levels - but with a scary arch-enemy that is almost always on your toes so you have little time to enjoy all this stuff. Oh well.\n\nIt is scary, so be prepared. It is even more scary in Stereo 3D, but looks really great. If you have nVidia 3D Vision setup, install the patch from HelixMod website that improves the quality of stereo. And if you play on a passive 3D TV like me, make sure to install the monitor driver ovverride to play in proper 1920x1080x60 mode instead of 24 fps (google 'pasive 3dtv edid override').","March 12","true","26.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

I am VERY GLAD that I chose to give it a chance!\n\nAlien Isolation stays true to the source by capturing and adapting every detail (big and small) from the movie. From the eerie soundtrack and sound effects, down to the 1980s computer terminals. To say that I was impressed by the game’s environment would be an understatement. While the art and sound helps set the right atmosphere, the game also has a wonderful story that made me want to keep playing just to find out what’s going to happen next…. No matter how scared I was, I kept pushing forward.  And on that note, the true icing on the cake is the masterfully terrifying AI that was bestowed on the Alien creature that is hunting you down on the station. It is very unpredictable, to such a degree that I would spend 5-10 minutes hiding in a locker still wondering whether or not it’s safe to come out. I played the game on medium difficulty, I am sure on Hard the AI is even more intense. Definitely adds a whole new level of terror to the horror FPS genre.\n\nIn conclusion, if you love nearly flat-lining while playing a video game, Alien Isolation won’t disappoint you. And if you love Alien and you ever wanted to know what it would feel like to try and outsmart a Xenomorph, this game captures that experience wonderfully! I was scared all throughout, and I enjoyed every second of it.\n\n10/10","January 4, 2015","true","22.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The harder difficulties caused me some problems however, the game could become very difficult at times that forced me to lower the difficulty settings but that in itself isn't a problem, the Alien universe is unforgiving after all.

The atmosphere has been masterly crafted to resemble the original Alien movies. The story is well written, save for some tedious bits towards the end (see issues list below). I won't repeat it here as much has been written about it elsewhere already. In general, the story is gripping, understandable and not too convoluted in contrast to too many titles nowadays which try to unnecessarily outsmart the player/viewer. Some twists and turns are there as should, but nothing too wild. Stays within the realm of "could happen", as a good scifi piece should.\n\nVisually the game is among the best I have ever seen. You probably can't do a much better job with today's technology. The environment looks almost as good as on film. Objects are modelled in high detail, with style that always stays true to the film. Some areas are cozy, some cold, and often I just found myself looking around, letting it all sink in. Lighting stood out to me as particularly impressive, really adding to the authenticity of the world.\n\nCharacter models are very good but not perfect, still a long way to overcome the uncanny valley. Interaction with NPCs also left room for improvement. I would have liked to see more lively friendly NPCs in particular. The sense of being stranded in a space station with a hideous monster was not apparent in their behaviour.\n\nAudio is top notch. From the station's creepy sounds of decay to the alien's growls and hisses, the soundscape together with beautiful visuals truly create an immersive universe. Voice acting is good and casting Sigourney Weaver to voice the original Ripley is a nice touch.\n\nGameplay at its core is a pretty standard first person adventure: collect / craft items, collect keycards to access closed areas, power up/down this or that system to advance. Using tools and operating control panels in the game requires different button sequences and combinations, adding to the illusion that you are actually operating a more complicated instrument and not just pushing buttons. To avoid the alien and other threats you need to sneak around quietly, hide in closets and pay attention to the motion tracker to keep you safe. You can craft weapons and distractions (EMP grenades, noisemakers, etc.) to help you on your way.\n\nDuring the story there is some going back and forth between areas you have already visited, but I only found that positive as it contributed to the feeling of being closed in the space station with no way out. The game is also semi-open in the sense that it allows you to visit some areas that are not directly on your path, i.e. it is not a strict tunnel run.\n\nGameplay and design is mostly great, but I did encounter some issues. Here's a non-exhaustive list:\n- The first WTF moment was in one of the early missions where you encounter hostiles for the first time. They are armed, so when you knock them out their revolver drops on the ground. So you are alone in a hostile environment, with a revolver at your feet. You know it's real because you can kick it around. You would surely like to pick it up. But nope, you can't. You can kick it around, but can't pick it up. At the end of the day, a very small detail but this kind of stuff should never end up in a game of this caliber.\n- Pulling away from computer terminals etc. takes too long. Designers rather chose to show pretty animations instead of letting the player snap out immediately, e.g. to knock out that android who's just about to strangle you. Unrealistic and annoying.\n- Jump scares. Personally, I don't find them scary, only annoying when used in excess. For me, creating a truly scary atmosphere needs to be a long process, a steady build-up of tension using subtle tools of design and storytelling. Luckily the designers did well in that department, so jump scares are not the only tool they used to keep you on your toes. Again, a small dent in otherwise shining armor.\n- Sometimes the alien felt a bit too psychic. Many completely unavoidable deaths.\n- Unmarked doors in mission 11. Some open, some don't, can't really know without bumping into them. Some event triggers in this mission were too fiddly.\n- The alien derelict mission was a bit of a filler. Maybe a cutscene would have done it instead?\n- The map is sometimes confusing since it doesn't indicate clearly on which floor your goal is.\n- The ending of the game drags for way too long. Some of the twists that prolong the game for yet another 15 mins felt artificial.\n\nAnyway, the positives FAR outweigh the negatives. Never before has a movie universe been turned into a game this well. Bought it on sale for -50%, but on hindsight would not have regretted paying full price either. If you love scifi and adventure, get this game. Highly recommended.","January 1, 2015","true","22.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Despite some minor frustrations in the beginning with not having any idea where I was supposed to go and a fairly slow plot, the game starts picking up tremendously with the introduction of the Alien about an hour or two in.  The alien is absolutely terrifying and a certain experience with the Alien hive terrified me more than any game has before.\n\n\nPros:\n- Gorgeous Graphics\n- Great Stealth Mechanics\n- Interesting craftable items (though I didn't use them that much)\n- Interesting and mysterious plot\n- Satisfyingly scary\n- True to the movie Alien\n\nCons:\n- A few minor glitches (the alien can clip through some things and items can float in the air)\n- Really long campaign (took me about 24 hours to complete the game)\n- There are a lot of mini-games which I mostly found fun but some were kinda stupid\n- Lag (my computer laged slightly during the a fairly short reactor sequence)\n- The Androids (Super fricking annoying)\n\nOver all if you're a fan of sci-fi horror, and especialy if you love the Alien series, and can get over the few cons get this game.  I'm not a big fan of survival horror and I still enjoyed this game immensely.  9/10\n","January 1, 2015","true","26.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The amount of detail that went into this title is beautiful, they really captured the atmosphere that made Alien what it was in the movies. Toss in the Alien, some low-budget malfunctioning androids and a bunch of edgy civilians, make ammunition and high powered weaponry scarce and you've got some serious challenges ahead of you. The game itself recommends you play on hard and there's a good reason why, it's a survival horror. What you need to bare in mind here is you are mostly helpless and the sooner you realize you're not going to take everyone out head on, the sooner you're going to set yourself up to appreciate every tense moment this game throws at you and there will be alot seeing as the Alien will stalk you through every inch of the Sevastopol station. The way in which TCA made a singular alien such a huge threat this time around was a smart move, you will respect the damn thing. It's agile and incredibly aggressive, the worst thing you can possibly do while navigating is run, it's a death sentence, and just because you hid in a locker or escaped into a vent doesn't mean you're safe. Believe me when I tell you that this ♥♥♥♥er can catch you out ANYWHERE. The game paced itself perfectly, the graphics were amazing, showing off one hell of a lighting system that just made the atmosphere top notch, the music was on que with the movies, just about every aspect of this game was done right and true to the movies. It's a game that deserves the title of best game of 2014, easily.","October 13, 2014","true","26.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well, it should have had.\nBut over time you find out, that the station has seen its best times. And now it is sold. Sold to a company, which has of course economic interests. This interest is on the station, and it's not the shops or the people.\nWhile you explore the station, you soon realize there is something wrong. The communication is interrupted, people are hiding and are afraid. People are vanishing, Androids behave strange, the station's main computer locks everthing down... to protect. To protect you? No...\n\nThe game is about finding all that out. And it's fun. Enjoy the nice views of inside and outside the station, as the graphics is very nice and shows a lot of passion for details. What you see is very close to the interior of the Nostromo you know from the first Alien movie. The game has so many parallels to the movie, it is awesome to experience those details. Also the sound is great, melody and sound effects... you will recognize them again and again from the movie.\n\nThere are gamers, who say the game isn't scary. Well, one the one hand you should let get yourself into the atmosphere of the game, as it is much more fun. On the other hand, even if you get used to the frightning atmosphere, the game will stay thrilling over the whole story. Hiding is key.\nAnd the game is not unfair at any time. You just have to learn to recognize the signs. Listen to the sounds, spot hiding places, cause distraction, trust the motion tracker and the direction to the objective (it is from where you stand, and will lead you around obstacles)... then you always have a chance to survive.\n\nNevertheless the game is not perfect. It has some issues, like different keybinding than shown on screen (at least in the german version), stepless leaning only possible with controller (I used keyboard and mouse all the time), tracker mislead one or two times (path was on a different level). But these are all minor issues imho. The game is very well playable on PC with keyboard and mouse, the only real negative aspect... it's not available for Linux (yet?) ;)\n\nFor fans of the Alien franchise this game is a must have of course. It is quite different to all those shooters. But it is also a recommended game for sci-fi fans, survival-horror fans and fans of games where you must not rush through the levels. Because running will make noise, and noise will reveal your position. There are a lot of different dangers, which are seeking for you.","December 1, 2014","true","20.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Reminded me alot of the first Dead Space game (but even more scary  - I quess mainly because its first person).\nThe low-fi sci-fi / retro look is a gift for every fan of the alien movie(s) and done very well, very nice design.\nSo if you don't have the computer to play on ultra settings, I recommend getting it for consoles. During the cutscenes it felt like watching an ALIEN movie.\nWhen combining stealth and action tactics, its very intense. For example I used stealth to bypass an human patrol and reach an generator. Once I pushed the button, I ran away from the androids and the alien and then sneaked up to the human patrol blocking the pass to the exit. My motion tracker told me the alien was coming up behind me (because I was sprinting/running away from it) so I decided to use my gun to shoot some crew members (patrol) while the alien would deal with the rest of them as I just ran through guns blazing to get to the exit before the alien catches me - very close but it worked :)\nSince they added androids and hostile crew members, the gameplay brings some changes as it would be pretty repetitive with just the alien. (Altho if you want that, I quess you can play the Nostromo DLC)\n\nNegative:\nThe AI isn't good at all. Human enemies are pretty stupid. I walked up to two guys and hit one with the hammer (loud melee fight) and the other guy standing right in front of that fight (facing the other way) didn't notice anything.\nStanding inside of >OPEN< vents, enemies passing by never noticed me so far.\n\nThe alien AI seemed pretty random, but not intelligent at all. Like: yes, you don't know what it's gonna do next - BUT not like it will actually do something, that makes sense. More like scripted random, not intelligent random :D\nThe alien will always be in the area around you. Yes they said that it could smell you and so be on the hunt for you, but that's not true. It's just SCRIPTED to be nearby. Like, even if it's just heading into the opposite direction of yours and you move on, it will suddenly be teleported into an vent exit nearby. So it's not hunting, just being teleported nearby by scripts. It would also often double and triple check a room instead of checking the other surrounding rooms.\nSo at those parts it turns from being scary to just being annoying - unless you have the flamethrower ;-)\n\nBut atleast it's random, so if you can forgive the very basic AI and live with the scripted stuff, it's still a damn good alien game.","October 8, 2014","true","20.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The AI might seem annoying at first, but I really learned to appreciate it.\n\nThe graphics are ♥♥♥♥ing crazy, game played smooth and everything was clean. There were many times where I would stop and just stare and the surroundings. The lighting was top notch, really complimented and added to the atmosphere.\n\nThe music and sounds were very well done. The voice acting was superb. My favorite was the thumping from the alien crawling along the vents above me.\n\nI finished the game in 18 hours, I'm not sure if this is typical. I do like to explore and really get into the game. But those were 18 hours of bliss... though maybe not the space suit parts. Those parts were honestly kind of boring, however they were short. I also haven't touched the dlc, which I actually want to play.\n\nI got this on sale, but I would've paid full price for this.","August 6, 2015","true","18.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well, it should have had.\nBut over time you find out, that the station has seen its best times. And now it is sold. Sold to a company, which has of course economic interests. This interest is on the station, and it's not the shops or the people.\nWhile you explore the station, you soon realize there is something wrong. The communication is interrupted, people are hiding and are afraid. People are vanishing, Androids behave strange, the station's main computer locks everthing down... to protect. To protect you? No...\n\nThe game is about finding all that out. And it's fun. Enjoy the nice views of inside and outside the station, as the graphics is very nice and shows a lot of passion for details. What you see is very close to the interior of the Nostromo you know from the first Alien movie. The game has so many parallels to the movie, it is awesome to experience those details. Also the sound is great, melody and sound effects... you will recognize them again and again from the movie.\n\nThere are gamers, who say the game isn't scary. Well, one the one hand you should let get yourself into the atmosphere of the game, as it is much more fun. On the other hand, even if you get used to the frightning atmosphere, the game will stay thrilling over the whole story. Hiding is key.\nAnd the game is not unfair at any time. You just have to learn to recognize the signs. Listen to the sounds, spot hiding places, cause distraction, trust the motion tracker and the direction to the objective (it is from where you stand, and will lead you around obstacles)... then you always have a chance to survive.\n\nNevertheless the game is not perfect. It has some issues, like different keybinding than shown on screen (at least in the german version), stepless leaning only possible with controller (I used keyboard and mouse all the time), tracker mislead one or two times (path was on a different level). But these are all minor issues imho. The game is very well playable on PC with keyboard and mouse, the only real negative aspect... it's not available for Linux (yet?) ;)\n\nFor fans of the Alien franchise this game is a must have of course. It is quite different to all those shooters. But it is also a recommended game for sci-fi fans, survival-horror fans and fans of games where you must not rush through the levels. Because running will make noise, and noise will reveal your position. There are a lot of different dangers, which are seeking for you.","December 1, 2014","true","20.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I completed it in two sittings.\n\nIt took me a few attempts to figure out how things worked in the game, especially line of sight and sound. Once you understand how the different enemy types react to specific stimuli, it becomes rather easy, at least on Medium difficulty. However, this is one of those Metroidvania FPS games where you revisit certain locations of the game multiple times with new tools--and I LOVE that.\n\nThis game nails the atmosphere. Sound effects, music, voice acting--all stellar. I highly recommend using surround sound, even if it's virtual.\n\nThere are some trial and error moments in the game, but they are few and far between. Those usually set you back a few minutes and can cause some frustration, but it's as simple as learning basic traversal patterns.\n\nAs a horror game, this is one of the best. Nothing comes quite close to holding your breath in a locker while the Alien stares into it, or hiding under a table as its tail slithers by. And nothing is quite as heart-pounding as hearing it scream as it spots you, and you make a mad dash around corners looking for a hiding spot. WHEW!\n\nThere are set pieces which made me pause and take numerous screenshots. This is a work of art! I will one day (maybe soon) go back into it and play on Nightmare difficulty, but because this game is so long (around 20 hours if you take your time and explore and find collectibles), it may have to wait a bit.\n\nPLAY THIS GAME!","January 6, 2015","true","53.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've never known what this franchise was, what the culture was behind it, and I had never even come close to having a peaking interest in the Alien universe. This fiendishly addictive hellhole of a game has shown me how wrong I was in not looking into the series.\n\nStep into the shoes of Ripley. Amanda Ripley. Struggle onward against seemingly impossible odds, and if you're anything like me, you'll almost feel as though you ARE Ripley. With a relatively slow paced style of play, along with a hearty helping of Storyline, You will step into Sevestopol station. As you traverse this wreckage of something that once was, your goal becomes clear. Survive.\n\nProbably the most thrilling aspect of this game is that if it catches hold of you, which it certainly should, All of Amandas feats and Failures will feel connected to you. as if you'd been there the whole time, catching breaths to avoid detection, frantically searching for a clue as to where it might be. And all of Amandas Failures, will be yours too. her feelings, her thoughts, everything feels as though you, are the one going through the incident. Every emergency station you succesfully trigger will be a wonderful accomplishment, and Amandas yearning to figure out the whereabouts of Ellen Ripley drives you forward.\n\nFor newcomers, the story doesn't feel as though you need to see the movie. everything is very nice and clean. It's obvious that Amanda, nor anyone else has encountered anything going on. So don't feel out of the loop if you haven't either (i.e me). With all of this said, take notice that this isn't like more modern games. checkpoints, ammo, and survivablity chances are all heavily in the hands of the player. you won't progress unless you make an effort to do so, and if you don't, you'll die trying.\n\nAlthough "end" is a little lengthy, this title is absolutely worth the time. The retro sci-fi enviornment is wonderfully crafted, and brought back memories of another title held high by myself and others, Bioshock.\n\nIn short, Alien: Isolation is a lovingly crafted piece of work, with a compelling storyline and incredibly immersive world. By the end I was balled up, shaking in my wee little booties, along with tissues that I had been forced to grab after several moments in the game left me bawling uncontrollably, whether that be from sadness, sympathy, or fear.","October 11, 2014","true","16.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Oh and the sound design may be the best I have seen (or rather heard) in a game to this day.\n\nSecond, it is damn TENSE! Not terrifying, but I still had a few jumpscares, and they were NOT SCRIPTED. You really feel like the beast is chasing you, and every move you make can alert it. The progression through the levels is also very well done. The parts where you have to avoid androids can be a bit annoying though.\n\nFinally, the story is cool. You quicky empathize with Amanda, trying to find "closure" about her mother's disappearance. All the franchise themes (inhumane corporations, humane synthetics, what happens to people when they are in survivor mode, etc...) are well exploited, even if we'd have wished for a bit more... innovation?\n\nSo if you are an alien fan, its a must have. I may even try some of the DLC's, because the main game was well worth the money, but I WANT MORE!","April 16, 2015","true","29.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GalileanMoon/recommended/214490/","GalileanMoon","Callisto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GalileanMoon/","84 products in account","Get this game. It's incredible. Even though I think the ending and final 2 hours were a bit lackluster, the rest of the game more than makes up for it. The music is great, the graphics are very good, and it's also a great PC port. The story is good as a standalone game for players who don't know alot about the Alien franchise, but it's even better for fans of it, as it's filled with references and audio logs recorded by the original cast of Alien.\n\nI beat the game at hard difficulty, which I recommend. It's a great challenge and I got a bit frustrated at times but I never wanted to lower the difficulty.\n\nThe thing I love most about this game is how unscripted the encounters are and how much cool stuff can happen. Some of the best parts of the game is when human enemies are in the same area as the alien and the alien is hunting you both. You do things like purposefully get the other humans to see you so that they will start shooting, so that the alien will hear the gunfire and take them out for you.\n\nOnce I was sneaking around this area going into every room scavening for supplies (this game nails survival-horror scavenging and making you feel like every bullet counts) and as I exited the room an enemy human was at the door. I panicked, pulled out my revolver and shot him 2 times in the chest. Knowing the alien heard me, I ran as fast as I could back into the room to hide in a locker. The split second I closed the locker door the alien dropped down from the vent in the ceiling and he eventually wandered away. Moments like this are totally unscripted and they are my favorite part of the game.\n\nThis game also has native Oculus Rift support. You have to go into the game's files to access it, but it was put in there by the developers, so I consider it native. I had the chance to try it at my friend's house and it was undescribable. I was totally and completely immersed in the game, and I was convinced I was actually there. I didn't actually get to the part where the alien starts appearing (about 1 hour in), but I imagine it's terrifying. The game itself without the Rift is more intense and stressful than it is scary, but I'm sure it'd go full pants-crapping mode in the Rift. It's also one of the only full-sized games to natively support the Rift at the moment. The Rift support isn't perfect, there's lots of clipping during scripted events, and that's why I imagine it's hidden in the files but it's still absolutely worth it if you have a Rift. Looking out the window into space in the beginning part of the game is jaw-dropping. Just try to not have a heart attack while playing.\n\nI rate games from how much I enjoy them, and even though this game has a few problems, like the ending and final hours, it didn't affect the enjoyment of the game at all for me.

Also, I've never played a game quite like it. I suppose you could say it is similar to Amnesia, but the AI is greatly smarter in this, it LEARNS FROM YOUR ACTIONS! And not only do you have to deal with the Alien, there are humans and synthetics to watch out for.\n\nI genuinely feel this game has gives the movie justice and is a potential GOTY.\n\n10/10\n\nPS.

It feels a lot like the movie, the music is great, the setting is great. There's an excellent mood in general and it is scary. The most scary game I've played.\n\nThe alien is unseen for a long time. I've played for 5 hours and only been killed by it once, seen it three times maybe. But you die a lot if you are not careful, the alien isn't the only thing trying to kill you. The save points aren't as automatic as I sometimes thought, so you have to save a lot, using the save points scattered around the place.\n\nSometimes you have to try the same thing over and over again and that can become frustrating after a while and detract from the experience.\n\nGraphicswise it's beautiful, some elements look old-fashioned, like some of the space junk that can be seen through windows because of the cartoonish way it loops, but that's the only negative commet so far.\n\nTechnically:\nPerformance is astonishing, I'm running 60FPS while both streaming via OBS and Shadowplay recording. My CPU is an ancient i7 860 moderately overclocked to around 3,4. GPU is a GTX 770 and I've got 16gb of ram.

Despite some notable shortcomings.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Initial missions where you are getting acquainted with the station and Alien missions are the highlight of the game.\n+ Alien is very unpredictable and cannot be killed, so you have to use tools you craft or find to distract it. Or better yet - try to sneak around without making any noise. The sense of dread is ever present. Its AI however is nothing innovative despite what reviews tell you, however it works.\n+ No autosave, no save-anytime. There are emergency phone stations, that are admittedly well spread across Sevastopol - and that's the only way it happens. DO NOT ignore ANY possibility to save the game!\n+ Retrofuturistic art is outstanding. Most of the decorations are direct copies from the Alien movie and the station crafted with them is very memorable. The well done lighting only adds to the atmosphere.\n+ Sound is great. Motion tracker (which is the most important tool in the game and looking canonically badass at that) provides only vague clues to where enemies are, so you have to use your own ears too. Besides enemies hear noise too - which itself can be used as a tool. Even hitting the wall with a maintenance jack can work as a distraction.\n+ Alien is not the only enemy, initial human/android sections are pretty creepy too. But only at first (see below).\n+ Very adequately administered backtracking which I like since it always comes with some new stuff accessible here and there and adds to the sense that you indeed move around the station, instead of following a straight pass like other Alien-universe games.\n\nCons:\n\n- Lategame missions that serve little purpose but to artificially extend the gametime. They are filled with androids and humans and some parts of them force you into a dull shooty combat. This alone delivers a huge hit to an otherwise interesting and fun game.\n- Last missions are extremely scripted and linear, but despite that the game ends abruptly (still worth completing it however).\n- Plot is rather weak and is full of cliches and predictable twists collected from across Alien movies.\n- Being multiplatform for PS3/X360 forces the game to have small areas and makes loading screens another enemy.\n\nAlso to me it's better at being Bioshock (which it clearly tried to copy) in many ways than Bioshock itself.","April 8, 2015","true","33.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Not a bad thing, but that's the point of keeping this game realistically difficult. Not because of the sheer amount of enemies swarming the motion tracker, but because you have to navigate from one checkpoint to another while avoiding the Alien and hostiles. And running makes enough noise to stop you dead in your tracks the moment the Alien storms towards your direction.\n\nAfter playing it for a while, you'll understand that shooting doesn't make you invulnerable. And to top if off, you need loads of PATIENCE and TIME. Because, expect to die from the simplest mistakes such as attracting the Alien and failing to subdue enemies in time or a combination of both. Saving comes from save booths, not like "Press key to save progress". This adds to the difficulty. Mess a step and you'll have to start back from the last checkpoint.\n\nSeriously, buy this game if you want to immerse yourself in a survival horror like no other.

All hell has broken lose on Sevastopol and now you face danger and terror at every turn, and at the center of it all, the Xenomorph.\n\nAlien Isolation looks long and hard at Alien, and decides what built up suspense for that film was not the terrifying action moments, it was the slow-burning tension, and this game perfectly replicates that. The game paces itself phenomenally, electing to not even show the Alien until potentially an hour and half into the game, letting you get on edge, excited, anxious even.\n\nThen when it comes, you wish you could go back to before in a heartbeat. The Alien is a cunning creature, learning your behavioral patterns and adapting to your strategies. Just because you could distract it with a noisemaker one time, doesn't gurantee that it will fall for the trick again. The terror is very real, and you truly feel as though you are being relentlessly hunted, with the chase only given up at chance times. You carefully think out your every move, you wait for it to leave and ponder if it will quickly run back, you watch in horror as it stalks your room, creeping towards the closet you reside in. Any noise you make can be heard, and likewise with everyone else. Just because you're being careful doesn't mean someone else in the area is, and the Alien will gladly come for them, sweeping you up as a bonus. The AI that Creative Assembly has constructed in this game is one of the most intelligent and adaptive programs to date.\n\nAs you wander Sevastopol, you sometimes get glances out of windows, giving you unparalleled splendor to be seen in the wide, expansive views of space, brought together with the hand down, phenomenal lighting effects. While graphics are very servicable, the game truly shines visually with it's dynamic lighting. Swinging lights on the ceiling bounce back and forth, illuminating different locations, while shadows are crisp and fluid. The models themselves have great facial construction, and the Alien is the best we've seen in years.\n\nThe game has so many little details added for atmosphere, it truly feels like you're on the set for Alien. Little Drinking Birds sit on desks, common utilites are exactly like in the films, and there is an obvious 1979 Future feel to the world. Computers take time to boot up, save stations require you to wait for the activation lights, and small maintenance minigames look and feel exactly like the film.\n\nThe game, while mostly linear, has a sort of Metroidvania feel to it despite you getting everything in order. Most of the time, items you recieve start out weak, but you find upgrades to them, allowing you to access new places and find new secrets. Going off the beaten path can reward you with crafting parts, blueprints, audiologs, and logs from the Nostromo itself.\n\nThe game allows you total stealth freedom, giving you numerous craftable devices, different paths to an objective, and dynamic hostiles, which interact with eachother in different ways. You can craft different devices like noisemakers, EMPs, Molotovs, and Pipe bombs, and employ them how you see fit. Missions feel dynamic, and while most have a certain reach a point, activate a thing, return, layout to them, the game keeps it fresh with scripted events, new paths unveiling, and different enemies.\n\nThe Alien however, remains the star of the show, but finds himself put to the side for some time to allow for greater world building and pacing. The game isn't afraid of missions dedicated to immersion, with one putting you on LV-426, the planet from Alien and Aliens. It's a complete love letter to the fans, with audio logs recorded by all the original actors (Minus Ian Holm, but you wouldn't think listening to the impersonator). The game spends a period of time without the Alien, most have complained, but what it really does is desenstise you to danger, so when the Alien returns, you get to relive all that introductary fear again. So much attention to world detail really pays off, and objects/locations/style of construction are all near identical to what you see in the film.\n\nAll this tension is complemented by the fantastic and dynamic score, rising in excitement when you are spotted, flaring at moments of action, and incurring deep feelings of dread.\n\nEverything in the game just works so well with eachother, the game truly feels like an authentic experience. This is an unbelieveably high reccomendation for any Alien fans, and horror fans will find themselves completely enthralled with the experience. People not into horror games as well will most certainly find plenty to love about the horror hit of 2014.\n\nAs a final note, major credit is due to Creative Assembly, who until this point made turn based warfare games, for absolutely nailing everything about the horror genre, first person genre, and Alien universe on their first try.","November 14, 2015","true","94.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","6"

That said, my review might feel a bit bias, especially considering the Alien franchise never really had a game that could match up to it's awesomeness.\n\nFrom the moment you step into Sevastapol, your life gains a whole new meaning, which is to make sure you've enough underwear to last through the game.\n\nThe controls are pretty simple, and the UI is minimal, which leaves you with a lot more space to enjoy the beautiful and incredibly well designed space and station. It's impossible for anyone that has seen Alien not to feel the nostalgia and the eventual goosebumps, as you walk around the station with Ripley, while death stares you from above, and the mesmerizing soundtrack does its best to activate your paranoid personality. From the constant noises around the vents, to the sound of its movement, the xenomorph poses a threat everyone, unless you hide under a bed, or inside a locker, just to have him, well, it, come close and sniff you well enough to feel your essence and grip you close, close enough for its, let's call it inner mouth, to kiss you, if you know what I mean.\n\nThat said, and considering you're still reading this, Alien: Isolation is probably the game you have been waiting for. You, a horror fan, a suspense fan, and above all, an Alien fan.\n\nI can't really go further without spoiling all the "fun", but I can guarantee an incredible journey, which will, possibly, wake you up at night, screaming for help.\n\nGraphics: 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nAI: 8/10\nStory: 9/10\nOverall: 9.5/10","March 2, 2015","true","26.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The attention to art design and sound is second to none.  The Sevastopol - the arena in which the narrative plays out - provides multiple opportunities for the player to discover expositional background which fleshes out the events prior to the player's arrival.\n\nUnfortunately, and yes, I'm afraid this is the rub - the experience is ruined by what is some truly excruciatingly poor game design and some truly dire AI.\n\nThe problem is the way in which Creative Assembly has decided the alien isn't just a formidable killing machine - it's also psychic and tracks the player throughout a vast complex with the single-minded dedication of the shark from Jaws 4: The Revenge.\n\nThis has the net effect of turning what could be a tense game of cat and mouse into a frustrating, annoying wait for the alien killing machine to go away.  Which it never does.  Ever.\n\nThis - on its own - is a gameplay killer, but the developer's insistence on disempowering the player to the point of lunacy completely removes any incentive to progress.\n\nLet's count up the ways in which the alien has the advantage over the player:\n\n1)  Fast - much faster than the player when they're running.\n2)  Any attempt to run gives the Alien a lock on your location.  See point 1 - "Fast"\n3)  Invincible - the Alien cannot be killed or injured\n4)  Alien rubber bands inside a 40 foot radius from the player - it never leaves unless scripted to do so.\n5)  Hyper senses mean it can spot you when humans and androids cannot\n6)  Traverses through vents in the ceilings which the player cannot\n7)  Any attempt by the player to use vents results in broadcasting a ping to the Alien which then investigates the vents.\n\nOh, and the best bit.\n\n8)  Line of sight killer - if it sees you, you're dead.\n\n\nThe player's advantages:\n\nA) Motion tracker with an extremely limited range.\nB) You can hide in floor vents which the alien doesn't appear to have worked out.\n\nAlien: Isolation is a victim of exceptionally lazy game design.  Creative Assembly were so focused on terrifying the player, that they forgot to give the player the means to survive effectively.  Far too much of the player's progress is dependent upon luck or sheer dogged persistence in the face of highly random events.  The player spends far too much time listening to the motion tracker and has no opportunity whatsoever to engage with the world.  It's a tragic mis-step which completely undermines all the creative effort which has gone into the rest of the game.\n\nThe worst part is that this game has such potential.  It serves as an object lesson in the absolute necessity for someone who understands game design to participate in the process.\n\nGameplay is a cascade of feedback loops.  The primary loops are:\n\n1)  Moment to moment gameplay.  This is the primary loop which comprises the player action/feedback cycle which powers most of the game.  In Alien: Isolation this is limited to watching/listening to the motion tracker and diving under tables or into lockers.  It absolutely CRIPPLES the gameplay experience.\n\n2)  Short term strategising - Typically this is scenario-based planning which allows the player to size up a situation and construct a strategy to deal with the scenario.  The reward feedback is a more effective and easier execution of the primary loop in response to their planning.\n\nAlien: Isolation allows none of this.  No strategising is available because the only game loop is the "run and hide" cycle.\n\n3)  Medium term resource planning - This is where players make medium-term decisions in regard to the allocation of resources.  Typically it's choosing abilities, powers or artifacts which allow the player more options to influence the world.  Strategy involves delaying expenditure to "save up" for more powerful abilities or artefacts.\n\nAlien: Isolation makes a vague attempt at doing this with the ability to construct artefacts but the strategic imperatives for each artefact hark back the run and hide cycle and do little to enable the player's strategic choices.\n\nUltimately, this is a wonderfully realised world with incredibly disappointing gameplay which cripples the experience.\n\nNot recommended.","October 9, 2014","false","13.1"," 214 of 416 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","214","416","3","19"

An Alien you can make blood, but dont get killed? A bite to unrealistics. There should be more aliens that if you killed one, another one after a time his place and run away from gunfire and get seriously damage from headshots and other things and fly or die. The game is a most time running game, you go find a little new area do something, next area and later you get on a new area, the levels arent big, only if you need to crouch its a bit fare and boring (more if you need to replay a way thx bad save point system again and again to regain more game time). So most is crouching areas again maybe with other enemy type in it, but its not really interesting. The details are mostly the same, a bit more objectives would be great and more areas and enemy types (Alien Dogs or maybe real dogs or weapons (laser, air pression, plasma or something). Sometimes i think how far must people run to a toilette? That my Nightmare mode because i think i only see some in the medical rooms. A great station with many rooms but most you cant get in. Sad and disappointing. DLC are for me not interesting (no Achievements) and i test one and get killed 10 times by the alien with no clou what to do. Yeah smart (right, left, alien, dead). The 50 Achievements are good, but there could be more, kill 5 or 10 with pyroblaster or shock 10 or shock 10 Androids or get Achievements for 10,20,30,40 personal cards or for killing 25,50,75 by an Alien to make them more interesting. Trading Cards missing complete. But after all the game makes fun on hard you hope beeing save and then it find you in your hide out and you need to go back a long crouching way because bad save game spots. Strengths and weakness together. Easy modus is fine but could have more changes from the hard mode. For casual players to find the way without the map will be hard, maybe sometimes frustrating. The letters and voice mails you can find are nice but mostly with less or no new details and sometimes it feel to much the same a bit. Chances unused. Because they game could be much more.  I am sad that i can only give 89 % (because top atmosphere if you play the game pitch black (as dark as possible and on nightmare mode), for the full price 77 % and thx the first dlc ruined me the 2nd DLC i give for all 73 %, so get a discount and hopefully enjoy it.

It's clearly a labour of love on the developers part, with faithfully recreated scenery, environments, and audio that harken back to the original movies, and is masterfully tuned to keep the player on the edge of their seat.\n\nThe gameplay manages to avoid complete railroading, frequently providing the player with multiple solutions and rewarding exploration beyond simply following quest dots, and far from being 20-30 hours (For the genre and age, Isolation is remarkably long!) of hiding from aliens the game evolves with it's protagonist, becoming increasingly open and free-roaming in nature.\n\nMy only gripe came early in the game, as survival strategy around the alien especially, is often highly counter intuitive, and attempting to follow the normal conventions of video game stealth was consistently getting me killed, it was only when out of frustration I started playing silly bugger with the alien, the mechanics crystallised for me, and the gameplay really clicked. Some small changes in map layout would've helped a new player develop the correct skills sooner.\n\nOverall, for me, Alien: Isolation may well be the game that finally displaces System Shock 2 as my favourite sci-fi survival horror of all time, and that's not a title I give away lightly.","January 4, 2015","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Though at this point I feel the titular alien is a bit too familair to be properly frightening or haunting, they do manage to make encounters with it amazingly tense, constantly struggling to avoid its notice or distract or drive it off temporarily.\n\nIf that was all the game was, it'd end up being a bit miserable, but it paces itself well with other hazards aboard the station. For once, QTEs are used wisely to ramp up the tension (by making throwing switches or opening doors take extra time you don't necessarily have) and the command prompts mirror the actual actions being performed. The crafting system is decent and item caps encourage you to make use of and craft items accordingly. The difficulty is actually a bit hard on normal difficulty - encounters with the alien will inevitably result in a game over screen and at times mounting frustration. It's something you have to cope and get used to - you will die, and the same relies on save points and checkpoints. Though generally save points are scattered liberally enough to keep this from being an issue, at times encounters with the alien can be overlong and result in annoyance at being bounced back to the start of a long sequence. The environments, though, are a fascinating reproduction of the movies from the 70s and 80s, right down to command-line, ASCII-style computer interfaces and glowing lights on consoles with no particular purpose.\n\nOverall, it stands out as one of the best survival horror games in years. Things inevitably get much worse for Ripley's circumstands, and it gives you a terrific amount of choice (stealth, combat, gadgets) when it comes to overcoming many obstacles. It suffers from the story beats being a little too familiar for those familiar with the franchise, but thankfully never descends into pure cliche. The story is actually surprisingly long, which many will find satisfying, but I felt like it was a bit overlong. Still, it's an amazing effort for a freshman developer in the genre, and I felt like I had to steel myself every time I dove in. Absolutely worth if you enjoy survival horror or want to see what happens the rare time the Alien franchise is handled as maturely and intelligently as can be managed for a creature with a mouth inside a mouth.","December 28, 2014","true","22.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The motion tracker is also a great tool, but it can be heard by actors so make sure your not using it near the enemy tracking you, Specially not in lockers.\n\nCONS - the lack of save locations means if you die you will lose alot of progress, while on some level it adds to the stress it will frustrate you.\n\nConfussed -  They didn't make the androids and enemy to the Aliens.\n* You can't get weapons off a person you killed, you can take there ammo but not their weapon  this is a really weird design choice.\n\nThis game is very challenging and will test your patience and zeal.  Its not perfect but it takes the original movie and honors it,  the detail is spot on, the sound effects are just like watching the movie.  the visuals and graphics are amazing on ultra high.\nP.S  Your gonna hate the med labs, its brutal best tips.\n* The Actors have no set paths its all random, and thier actions will be based on the enviroment.\n* if your hiding in the locker * HOLD your BREATH, LEAN back this will reduce the risk of being seen or heard.\n* IF you get frustrated Stop and take a break.  SAVE - SAVE - SAVE (you will die alot).\n* Androids are slow and can't climb in vents, and you can run away.\n* I Think the alien sees like a T-REX, its vison is based off movement at a distance, while sometimes i thought i was toast and it walked by and other times i fell its all good and bam, you hear that screech(Thump, Thump, thump) dead.\n\nThis is not like the Aliens movie but the original Alien movie, no flashy guns. no massive battle, its a stealth game, hide runs and live. stay fight and die.","October 26, 2014","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The atmosphere and sound design are unparalled and the attention to detail displays a level of understanding and polish that is rarely seen in the genre. This is the best game based on the Alien franchise to date and one of the finest survival horror games I have ever played. This is one of those rare times when a game has completely lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe core gameplay revolves around using stealth and redirection to avoid dangerous encounters. You will often travel through ventilation shafts and air ducts, and may find yourself hiding under tables or inside lockers and containers to avoid detection. You will need to remember to lean back and hold your breath if you don't want to be snatched out of your hiding spot! Being hunted by an unrelenting and dangerous alien isn't the only source of terror in Alien: Isolation; you will encounter hostile androids and humans that can be equally as frightening. To assist in your survival on Sevastopol, you can scavenge for resources to craft items like flares, flash bangs, smoke bombs, noise makers, EMP mines and other tools, which are useful for creating distractions or to disable your enemies. While revolvers, blunt objects and other weapons are available, these should be used as a last resort. The enemies are no push-over.\n\nThe story primarily unfolds through cinematic cutscenes and character interactions, but is supplemented with information and lore from audio recordings and computer terminals that are scattered throughout Sevastopol. Alien: Isolation does a fantastic job of building tension and fear with direction and design that pays great homage and rivals Ridely Scott's original 1979 film, "Alien". For fans of the Alien franchise, this is a no brainer, and for everyone else, it is an experience that rivals the best the genre has to offer.","October 11, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got this game for free for buying a new AMD graphics card. I'm so glad I played this game.\n\nPlaying Alien: Isolation is a truly terrifying experience. This is a very serious and dark game and it's definitely not a game to play if you just want to have fun. I played it in hard difficulty mode and that is the best way to play it. Your heart races through and skips a beat at every alien encounter. There are moments when I squirmed, jumped on my bed, closed my eyes and coiled. The alien crushes your hopes every time you think you made it through a mission. The alien is intelligent and unpredictable. You cannot kill it with your weapons. You have to avoid it by hiding under tables, crawling through vents etc. You can know where it is by using a radar-like tracker. But if it's close to you, it will hear the beep from the tracker and spot you and kill you in a gruesome manner.\n\nThe alien is not the only enemy on board the space station of Sevastopol. Just when you've escaped from the alien, you'd come across an android whose program has been changed to eliminate all life forms. At times I've felt I'd rather deal with the invincible alien than these androids that are extremely hard to kill. And then there are other human survivors who shoot at anyone they see for no reason. Every single enemy is so difficult to defeat that you'd very rarely use your weapons and rely on stealth instead.\n\nThe game starts very slowly. You won't even see the alien for the first 3 hours. The game also moves at a slow pace and picks up pace towards the end. So I think many people may not like this game until they've put about 12-15 hours into it. I'd recommend this game for anyone who liked the original Alien movie and are looking for a serious horror game to play.\n\nPros:\n- Gameplay experience - it's a huge plus for the game\n- Represents accurately the situation a desperate and desolate space station\n- The horrifying encounters with the alien\n- Sound : You'll be crapping bricks at every time a door opens, or a generator powers on, or when you turn on a switch wondering if the alien heard that. There are sounds that let you know when the alien comes down to floor from the vents or going back to the vents. They help you plan your strategy of escape\n- Music : There isn't music at a lot of places which builds up the suspense. And then suddenly there is loud dramatic music that would make your palms sweat in fear leaving you running and hiding just out of the fear\n\nCons:\n- Slow pace initially and a little bit longer story\n- Though the space station is huge, this is not an open world game. There are no side missions. The main story is the only mission you have\n- Eventhough you play as Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley from the movie, the story doesn't have much connection with Ellen and you feel the protagonist can be anyone else","January 3, 2015","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The most important thing to understand about this new entry into the series is it's radical shift in game-play design from those of which were, by an large, iterations on the same game-play first experienced in Doom. And it was with no surprise that the franchise was going to take this well trodden path as the sequel to the original film in the series was John Carmack's main inspiration in developing Doom.\n\nBy diagnosing the main problem with one of videogame's most popular genres The Creative Assembly have opted to make the player feel as vulnerable as possible in order to instil a genuine sense of dread and tension throughout the game. The game doesn't allow players to horde backpacks full of guns and ammo but instead forces you to use any meager gadget you can concoct in order to distract your enemies as opposed to mowing them down with little cost to your resources or safety. There are guns introduced later in the game and surprise surprise here in lies one of the games strange inconsistencies with the Alien cannon and potential flaws in it's game-play.\n\nAfter a slow burn introduction to the Sevastopol Station, a crumbling space port in it's last stages of being decommissioned, the game starts out incredibly reminiscent of Bioshock allowing the player to venture in at their own pace discovering computers containing personal logs by Sevastopol inhabitants and audio recordings that help to organically deliver the narrative element of the game. Once further into the Sevastopol, and the main elements have been introduced, the game-play really takes off with the Alien and other enemies all working together to create a wonderfully organic emergent gameplay style that is never scripted and always seems unique throughout repeat playthroughs. And repeat playthroughs of individual missions will become commonplace to even the most seasoned and skilled players as The Creative Assembly have done something truly amazing with the AI of it's titular enemy by designing it to work with heightened sensors that enable it to respond dynamically to sound and situations as opposed to being moved on predetermined paths with basic AI programming. In short this game is ♥♥♥♥ING HARD!\n\nThe look and feel of the game is stunning, albeit it with a minimal amount of dodgy cut-scenes, poor human facial animations and shader aliasing problems, as the lighting and graphical fidelity convinces you that you are in the world of Alien, one of cinemas most stunning and meticulously designed films. The Alien's design and animations are far beyond anything I've seen in any game and it's clear where Sega have really channeled their money opting, with minor cost to less vital parts of the game, to really bring the Alien to life.\n\nHowever there are some problems with the game, although minimal, and these are down in large part to the second half of this massive game. When I say massive I can tell you it must have taken me over 25 hours to complete the game on Normal difficulty on a very exploratory play-through and once the game reached the 15 hour mark for me, which would have been an ample length for a game of this kind the Alien "goes on vacation", for the third quarter of the game, leaving you pining for it's return. Once the game finds itself without an Alien you are left to contend with the station's second most deadly entity, the Androids, who prove to be somewhat less fulfilling. The game also chooses to ignore some vital elements of the Alien's life cycle introduced by James Cameron in the second movie which I feel are to it's detriment.\n\nOn the whole Alien: Isolation is one of the most tense and claustrophobic horror stealth games I've ever experienced and I heartily recommend to it to any and all that have even the slightest interest in horror and sci-fi. Well done CA the Alien is finally back in town!","October 14, 2014","true","44.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KorbenD/recommended/214490/","KorbenD",">f7> KorbenD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KorbenD/","530 products in account","There have been a large number of games based on the Alien franchise over the years.\n\nAtari 2600 (actually a better version of Pac Man than Atari's official one)\nThree versions of Aliens for the C64 and other PCs of the '80s, with only the Activision release having any real success.\nSeveral Alien 3 games, and also several Aliens vs. Predator releases.\n\nBut back in 1984, Argus released Alien for the C64.  It wasn't a platformer.  It wasn't a first person shooter (which hadn't even been invented at the time).  It wasn't even a puzzle game really.  What it managed to do, with the most rudimentary graphics, interface, and sound, was be scary.\n\nIn the game you chose various members of the Nostromo crew and had to search the ship to either kill the alien without damaging the ship too much, blast it out the airlock, or if there are 3 or fewer crewmembers remaining, set the autodestruct, catch the cat and escape on the shuttle.  Of course the alien is moving from room to room as well, and encountering it opened an animated screen showing the monster with loud sound effects.\n\nI've played basically every game based on the franchise, and the only one that ever got the tone of Alien was that little C64 game.  The rest of the games took their cues from Aliens and made the creatures easily killable cannon fodder.  The games might have been exciting and less fun than they should have been, but the developers seemed to think the subject matter was enough to work.  "Let's take a mediocre shooter and put aliens and predators in it!"  None of the games have been scary.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAlien: Isolation had a lot of hype before its release.  So did Aliens: Colonial Marines, and we know how that one turned out.  Like ACM, AI had some great preview videos.  It had people who had played the demo raving about it.  But there was still the expectation from a lot of people that when the final game came out, it would fall on its face like ACM did.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nAlien: Isolation is by far the best single player game I've played in years.  The story is well thought out and meshes well with the film.  It basically ends up being a 12-18 hour long horror movie.  However, I don't think that everything with Alien in the name requires a character named Ripley.  They could have easily written this with any generic new character and lost almost nothing except a small emotional part nearing the end.\n\nThe graphics engine is well optimized for its setting, with the gloomy corridors, harsh single point lighting, smoke and fire well represented.  The flamethrower effect is probably the best I've seen in any game.  It also runs well on fairly low end video cards, but keep in mind DirectX 11 is the minimum supported.  On the two cards I tried (GeForce GTX 680 and 980 at 1920x1080 144hz vsync on) there were no instances of stuttering or slowdown that I could see.  The art direction followed the design of Alien slavishly and it works.  Like the set of the Nostromo, the interiors of Sevestapol station look functional, lived-in, and real.\n\nLoad times were good, with levels changing in about 5-7 seconds.  The save system may drive some people nuts, but the relative rarity of the save points, coupled with the fact that it takes several seconds to save with you being vulnerable the whole time, adds even more tension to the game.\n\nThe alien itself.  It's BIG.  Like really big.  I'm not sure how they did it, but in a lot of games it's hard to get a sense of scale when you see something in the game environment, but they absolutely nailed it.  It's about 8-9 feet tall in the game, which is fairly close to the height of the original actor in the suit.  Bolaji Badejo was 7'2", and the head of the costume added another foot.  It's also smart.  If you move something, bump into things, open doors, it will notice.  If you keep hiding in an area, it will start to examine the area more closely.  If you hide in lockers a lot, it will start checking them.\n\nLockers.\n\nYou will see a lot of the inside of lockers.\n\nThe human and android AI isn't quite as good, with some glitches, but nothing game breaking.  If someone shoots at you, hide.  Not just from the person shooting, but what that sound inevitably attacts . . .\n\nNow, sound.  The sound design on this game is nothing short of amazing.  I'm not sure if there are awards for sound design and editing in games, but if there is the team on this game deserve every one of them.  The creaks and groans of the damaged space station are incredibly immersive.  The movement of the alien through the vents and its footsteps when it's walking around are suitably creepy.

When you play this game, you really feel like you're in the Alien universe. The audio and music really impressed me, due to keeping the mood steady and having you feel paranoid when nothing is happening... until it happens. After playing for almost 10 hours, I haven't grown tired of the scenery nor the game's setting. Really nice seeing a game hold up strong with just this concept.\n\nSince this is based on the PC version... the graphics are stunning. Some gameplay actually feels like you're in a cutscene, but really you're in control of the character during this. Particular segments are even breath taking if I dare say, which is of course, later in the game. The overall lighting and attention to detail is much appreciated in this game. Even looking at the character models, the Alien's design or other features were golden. That, and the environment never gets old so you'll remain immersed. There is some back tracking, but not to much where it becomes noticable.\n\nMechanics: The design of this game was very well thought out. While you can 'fight' off enemies, it's far wiser to stick with stealth. Any noise you make from kicking something over, to slamming the locker to hard, or activating anything shall in fact cause chances of the Alien coming in from the vents or drawing unwanted attention. The Motion Scanner is perhaps the most vital tool since it helps locate where living organisms are at. You can also craft items to help you in tight spots such as the Noise Maker or Flashbang. The game can be experienced in multiple ways in depending on how you use this tools to your advantage. Did I forget to mention that the game really punishes you for carelessly causing noises or wasting materials? Because it sure does and feels like a good challenge. Try going in the vents yourself while the Alien's crawling around... you might want to check your map for other alternatives.\n\nWhat I love about the game's core is that it truly feels like you're trying to survive. Don't expect to walk around blasting through anyone, especially the Alien. You are required to think ahead, plan where you'll wonder about, and be careful again in making noises. There's segments where you must hack doors and devices in order to continue onward, and at any moment... you can die. There's never a safe point, even when actually saving your game. The emergancy phone (aka to save your progress) will warn you if enemies are nearby.\n\nOh and even though you're not friends with the Alien, let's just say you can use the creature to your advantage in getting through certain situations such as heavily guarded areas by crazy survivors. One toss of, say, a flashbang or causing them to shoot at you will instantly alert the Alien to spring out and waste them away. It's really fun to see.\n\nAI: Honestly, the humans are a bit weak in terms of AI along with the voice acting. Besides the main character Ripley, who acts realistic when either facing a tough call, or getting emotional- everyone else kind of brings you out of the immersion. First off, the other survivors feel like they're reading off a script. Sometimes, they will stand still and not fire at you despite recently doing so for some reason. There are even occassions that the people will suddenly stare at you despite you're running at them with a wrench. I haven't ran into anyone else who has given me a reason to care about them.\n\nThe androids in the game have been done correctly. Simple, emotionless machines that talk civil but are frightning all the same. They don't chase the player by sprinting, but somehow manage to cause tension to rise regardless. Unlike the humans, you can't simply take them down with gunning them or wacking them, as they shall brush it off and assault you. This is where the beauty of the mechanics comes in as you use tools to delay or destroy them for good. Also, they look very devious and voiced perfectly to fit their role.\n\n... Now, what about the actual threat? The Alien?\n\nCannot lie to you guys, it's one of the most SMARTEST AI's that I have seen yet. Literally acts like an actual animal, traveling in the vents and coming out at random. When I say random, I mean it can actually come out whenever it wants from either hearing noise or noticing movement beneath it. But it doesn't just wander mindlessly, it'll actually hunt for you in ways you couldn't imagine. Hiding isn't even the best solution at times, for the Xenomorph will pick up your tactics and crush any hopes you had. The Alien also isn't out just for you... it will take down any survivors that are with you or against you in this terrifying journey. The Alien alone has brought fear in me that no other Aliens has done before in the previous games... especially Colonial Marines *cough* Trying to outrun the Alien or fight it shall result in an immediate death so plan carefully. It's not easy at all tricking this AI.\n\nStory: There is an actual plot in this, with terminals and recorders for you to look up. There's a lot of hidden context here and there, and only if you're brave enough to travel in optional rooms will you uncover the truth behind the events. Personally, it's worth investigating because some details are important for you to grasp at exactly why there's an Xenomorph here and why the people 'behave' in certain situations. I won't spoil it for you, but once you get far enough in the game... it'll surprise you how deep the plot actually is.\n\nThe main focus, however... involves Ripley trying to find out what happened to her mother 15 years ago. Of course, things go for the worse on the ship they were inspecting so now Ripley must survive and escape the ship while helping her crew mates pull through the challenges.\n\nDLC: Personally, I have not obtained it. Might purchase it after I beat the game, but for me it's a bit pricey so I shall wait to see. I apologize for not having a review on that (yet).\n\nTO LONG, DIDN'T READ:\nFantastic game, bringing back what you love about horror games. It doesn't require jump scares at all to strike fear into you... it's about the music, atmosphere, and how well the AI plays out to play the cards right. And boy, the Alien does certainly that above all else. The game faces problems like the humans being pretty bad at voice acting, lacking in good AI control, and just not worth investing in emotionally. Luckily, the main attraction which is the Alien is worth every penny spent on this game. At times, you might feel cheated by some cheap death, but it's certainly worth experiencing in my opinion. I adored how every action you took held a consequence, and even playing safe could be more risky than taking chances.\n\nDo note that it's not everyone's cup of tea. The pacing can be slow depending on how stealthy you are, and depending on the difficulty you place the game on- can make people very frustrated. However, the game does it's job highly well in scaring the player without cheap methods or feeling short lived. The game is scary, it feels exactly how an Alien game should be played and most importantly... it is my favorite horror game as to this day.

From the minute the game starts you can see the passion Creative Assembly has for the franchise, and it continues throughout the length of the game which to my surprise was much longer than I thought it would be. Everything from the visuals to the sound design are top notch, this is truly one of the best looking PC games to date. The Alien AI is almost a treat to go up against as you never really know what it is going to do next, so the feel of being hunted is real. If you have any interest in the genre and the subject matter then you owe it to yourself to check this game out, don't listen to the few negative reviews out there and make an opinion on the game for yourself.

The most important thing to understand about this new entry into the series is it's radical shift in game-play design from those of which were, by an large, iterations on the same game-play first experienced in Doom. And it was with no surprise that the franchise was going to take this well trodden path as the sequel to the original film in the series was John Carmack's main inspiration in developing Doom.\n\nBy diagnosing the main problem with one of videogame's most popular genres The Creative Assembly have opted to make the player feel as vulnerable as possible in order to instil a genuine sense of dread and tension throughout the game. The game doesn't allow players to horde backpacks full of guns and ammo but instead forces you to use any meager gadget you can concoct in order to distract your enemies as opposed to mowing them down with little cost to your resources or safety. There are guns introduced later in the game and surprise surprise here in lies one of the games strange inconsistencies with the Alien cannon and potential flaws in it's game-play.\n\nAfter a slow burn introduction to the Sevastopol Station, a crumbling space port in it's last stages of being decommissioned, the game starts out incredibly reminiscent of Bioshock allowing the player to venture in at their own pace discovering computers containing personal logs by Sevastopol inhabitants and audio recordings that help to organically deliver the narrative element of the game. Once further into the Sevastopol, and the main elements have been introduced, the game-play really takes off with the Alien and other enemies all working together to create a wonderfully organic emergent gameplay style that is never scripted and always seems unique throughout repeat playthroughs. And repeat playthroughs of individual missions will become commonplace to even the most seasoned and skilled players as The Creative Assembly have done something truly amazing with the AI of it's titular enemy by designing it to work with heightened sensors that enable it to respond dynamically to sound and situations as opposed to being moved on predetermined paths with basic AI programming. In short this game is ♥♥♥♥ING HARD!\n\nThe look and feel of the game is stunning, albeit it with a minimal amount of dodgy cut-scenes, poor human facial animations and shader aliasing problems, as the lighting and graphical fidelity convinces you that you are in the world of Alien, one of cinemas most stunning and meticulously designed films. The Alien's design and animations are far beyond anything I've seen in any game and it's clear where Sega have really channeled their money opting, with minor cost to less vital parts of the game, to really bring the Alien to life.\n\nHowever there are some problems with the game, although minimal, and these are down in large part to the second half of this massive game. When I say massive I can tell you it must have taken me over 25 hours to complete the game on Normal difficulty on a very exploratory play-through and once the game reached the 15 hour mark for me, which would have been an ample length for a game of this kind the Alien "goes on vacation", for the third quarter of the game, leaving you pining for it's return. Once the game finds itself without an Alien you are left to contend with the station's second most deadly entity, the Androids, who prove to be somewhat less fulfilling. The game also chooses to ignore some vital elements of the Alien's life cycle introduced by James Cameron in the second movie which I feel are to it's detriment.\n\nOn the whole Alien: Isolation is one of the most tense and claustrophobic horror stealth games I've ever experienced and I heartily recommend to it to any and all that have even the slightest interest in horror and sci-fi. Well done CA the Alien is finally back in town!","October 14, 2014","true","44.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KorbenD/recommended/214490/","KorbenD",">f7> KorbenD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KorbenD/","530 products in account","There have been a large number of games based on the Alien franchise over the years.\n\nAtari 2600 (actually a better version of Pac Man than Atari's official one)\nThree versions of Aliens for the C64 and other PCs of the '80s, with only the Activision release having any real success.\nSeveral Alien 3 games, and also several Aliens vs. Predator releases.\n\nBut back in 1984, Argus released Alien for the C64.  It wasn't a platformer.  It wasn't a first person shooter (which hadn't even been invented at the time).  It wasn't even a puzzle game really.  What it managed to do, with the most rudimentary graphics, interface, and sound, was be scary.\n\nIn the game you chose various members of the Nostromo crew and had to search the ship to either kill the alien without damaging the ship too much, blast it out the airlock, or if there are 3 or fewer crewmembers remaining, set the autodestruct, catch the cat and escape on the shuttle.  Of course the alien is moving from room to room as well, and encountering it opened an animated screen showing the monster with loud sound effects.\n\nI've played basically every game based on the franchise, and the only one that ever got the tone of Alien was that little C64 game.  The rest of the games took their cues from Aliens and made the creatures easily killable cannon fodder.  The games might have been exciting and less fun than they should have been, but the developers seemed to think the subject matter was enough to work.  "Let's take a mediocre shooter and put aliens and predators in it!"  None of the games have been scary.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAlien: Isolation had a lot of hype before its release.  So did Aliens: Colonial Marines, and we know how that one turned out.  Like ACM, AI had some great preview videos.  It had people who had played the demo raving about it.  But there was still the expectation from a lot of people that when the final game came out, it would fall on its face like ACM did.\n\nIt didn't.\n\nAlien: Isolation is by far the best single player game I've played in years.  The story is well thought out and meshes well with the film.  It basically ends up being a 12-18 hour long horror movie.  However, I don't think that everything with Alien in the name requires a character named Ripley.  They could have easily written this with any generic new character and lost almost nothing except a small emotional part nearing the end.\n\nThe graphics engine is well optimized for its setting, with the gloomy corridors, harsh single point lighting, smoke and fire well represented.  The flamethrower effect is probably the best I've seen in any game.  It also runs well on fairly low end video cards, but keep in mind DirectX 11 is the minimum supported.  On the two cards I tried (GeForce GTX 680 and 980 at 1920x1080 144hz vsync on) there were no instances of stuttering or slowdown that I could see.  The art direction followed the design of Alien slavishly and it works.  Like the set of the Nostromo, the interiors of Sevestapol station look functional, lived-in, and real.\n\nLoad times were good, with levels changing in about 5-7 seconds.  The save system may drive some people nuts, but the relative rarity of the save points, coupled with the fact that it takes several seconds to save with you being vulnerable the whole time, adds even more tension to the game.\n\nThe alien itself.  It's BIG.  Like really big.  I'm not sure how they did it, but in a lot of games it's hard to get a sense of scale when you see something in the game environment, but they absolutely nailed it.  It's about 8-9 feet tall in the game, which is fairly close to the height of the original actor in the suit.  Bolaji Badejo was 7'2", and the head of the costume added another foot.  It's also smart.  If you move something, bump into things, open doors, it will notice.  If you keep hiding in an area, it will start to examine the area more closely.  If you hide in lockers a lot, it will start checking them.\n\nLockers.\n\nYou will see a lot of the inside of lockers.\n\nThe human and android AI isn't quite as good, with some glitches, but nothing game breaking.  If someone shoots at you, hide.  Not just from the person shooting, but what that sound inevitably attacts . . .\n\nNow, sound.  The sound design on this game is nothing short of amazing.  I'm not sure if there are awards for sound design and editing in games, but if there is the team on this game deserve every one of them.  The creaks and groans of the damaged space station are incredibly immersive.  The movement of the alien through the vents and its footsteps when it's walking around are suitably creepy.  It also has a number of vocalizations that can clue you in on its mood.  The muted sounds in space owe a debt to Gravity.  Basically, if nothing is touching your suit, you don't hear it.  The other sounds, sirens, klaxons, doors, keyboards, welder, etc. are all spot on.  This game absolutely screams for a 5.1 or 7.1 system.\n\nVery highly recommended.","October 12, 2014","true","42.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gerafin/recommended/214490/","gerafin","Firewall Jackson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gerafin/","534 products in account","Over the years, the "Alien" franchise expanded from its claustrophobic horror roots into a sprawling canon, that somehow birthed monstrosities such as Aliens: Colonial Marines and Prometheus. Alien: Isolation positions itself as a direct sequel to the original film, both in tone and in the story arc. Ellen Ripley's daughter, Amanda, is led to a space station where information about her mother's disappearance is located. She then has to survive the same kind of horror that made the original movie so enduring.\n\nAlien: Isolation took me nearly a month to play through. This is somewhat startling because it only lasted 18 hours, and I really savored every one of those hours. Most games glue your butt to the seat by throwing out every aspect that isn't 'fun,' and hours generally evaporate in a haze of feel-good empowerment. Isolation, on the other hand, is not concerned with 'fun' but with providing a tense, exciting, and terrifying experience. I'm glad that Creative Assembly was given the chance to wield AAA funding in this indie-championed genre of survival horror, because they really did pull it off.\n\nIsolation so perfectly explores the feeling of being hunted by a terrifying space monster that it can be difficult to play, especially for long periods of time. The experience isn't just intense, or scary, but actually mentally draining. There is little to alleviate this tension, so if you're easily spooked or looking for a game to relax with, this is not a good choice. There were definitely days where I was just not up the task of evading the titular Alien, but I always looked forward to my next foray into Sevastopol.\n\nThe game does a good job at dragging you through the terror by exquisitely pacing every aspect of the design. You reach each save point just as your will to carry on is fading, and each game save emboldens you to continue just a little farther, to see what's next. As each mechanic begins to feel repetitive, they introduce something to mix it up. Just as getting eaten by the Alien begins to feel routine, they introduce a flamethrower that can scare it away for a short while, changing the dynamic from a black-and-white 'if you're seen, you're dead' into a tense game of conserving very limited fuel. You are gradually introduced to a variety of craftable items that change the way you solve problems, but never provide you with much power. The crafting system is very simple and feels kind of unnecessary, but it definitely adds to the atmosphere to be scavenging random bits from the environment to tape into makeshift items.\n\nThe gameplay generally consists of activating consoles, supplying power to things, finding keycards and passcodes, and getting from point A to point B without dying. It's a dull formula, but Isolation does its best to plaster over this traditional skeleton with an arsenal of clever design tricks. Amanda Ripley is (conveniently) an engineer, which lends credence to the game's conceit that progress can always be made by messing with Sevastopol's machinery. The levers you have to pull, the buttons you have to mash, and the terminals you have to interact with are satisfying objectives. Instead of just hitting E and watching a light change color, interacting with objects sometimes takes multiple button presses and involves satisfyingly mechanical noises and Ripley's hands performing full animations.\n\nMost objectives tied into the overall story well, and I only occasionally felt frustrated by tasks that seemed like busywork. The obstacles to be overcome between objectives are constantly in flux. The type of enemies present, the composition and relationship between them, and the environment are switched up frequently to provide interesting challenges. Even the simple corridor, that dull staple of games immemorial, becomes a terrifying expanse of unbroken sight lines with nowhere to hide.\n\nBy far the most interesting challenge is the Alien itself. While there are other dangerous entities on Sevastopol, the Alien is the smartest and most deadly. It is almost always a threat, as well, prowling through the ventilation system and wandering corridors, always close but not usually on-screen. This is something that movies figured out a long time ago, but games struggle to implement: monsters are scarier if you don't see a lot of them. When you see the Alien, it is in glimpses as you peek to see if it's still in the room, or as it stalks past your hiding spot as you hold your breath. You hear it and almost feel its presence, and it overshadows everything you do; but you don't spend a lot of time staring at it, giving your brain time to compartmentalize and understand this threat. They could have shortened its kill animations, as well, because these definitely begin to lose their edge and actually provide relief from the constant tension for their duration.\n\nThe game can be frustrating if you try to play it slowly. The Alien is exploring the area independently from you, not hovering over your shoulder, so you can (and should) generally move quickly from room to room. Crouch-walking and moving slowly increases the number of encounters you're going to have with the Alien, and actually makes the game far more difficult. It's easier and more satisfying to move quickly, but cautiously, and try to be ready to hide at a moment's notice. You'll quickly find a rhythm that works, but you have to break out of the habits that other stealth-oriented games have instilled in you. Hiding is not a 'visible/hidden' spectrum, but is completely logical and takes into account everything from whether the object you're holding is generating light or making noise, whether you're always hiding in the same place, how dark it is, and how much of you is exposed. For example, crouching under a desk isn't going to work if the Alien is across the room from you and can see under the desk from where it's standing. However, it works great if the Alien's right next to the desk because it can't see under the desk from that vantage point. It's logical, but it doesn't feel very game-y. It feels much more like you are playing against a human opponent, so I would get a rush of satisfaction when I outwitted the Alien that I usually only feel in multiplayer games.\n\nThe game is quite a looker, as well - it borrows heavily from the visual design of the films, which are still a sort of gold standard for sci-fi corridors. It's a perfectly done "70s future" lavishly implemented with excellent lighting and an eye for detail.\n\nAlien: Isolation crafts a near-perfect Alien experience. The tension and thrill of the experience is maintained right up through a terrific third act full of surprises. It's a game that breaks the rules with style and confidence, and really deserves to be played.","January 19, 2015","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I got this game for free for buying a new AMD graphics card. I'm so glad I played this game.\n\nPlaying Alien: Isolation is a truly terrifying experience. This is a very serious and dark game and it's definitely not a game to play if you just want to have fun. I played it in hard difficulty mode and that is the best way to play it. Your heart races through and skips a beat at every alien encounter. There are moments when I squirmed, jumped on my bed, closed my eyes and coiled. The alien crushes your hopes every time you think you made it through a mission. The alien is intelligent and unpredictable. You cannot kill it with your weapons. You have to avoid it by hiding under tables, crawling through vents etc. You can know where it is by using a radar-like tracker. But if it's close to you, it will hear the beep from the tracker and spot you and kill you in a gruesome manner.\n\nThe alien is not the only enemy on board the space station of Sevastopol. Just when you've escaped from the alien, you'd come across an android whose program has been changed to eliminate all life forms. At times I've felt I'd rather deal with the invincible alien than these androids that are extremely hard to kill. And then there are other human survivors who shoot at anyone they see for no reason. Every single enemy is so difficult to defeat that you'd very rarely use your weapons and rely on stealth instead.\n\nThe game starts very slowly. You won't even see the alien for the first 3 hours. The game also moves at a slow pace and picks up pace towards the end. So I think many people may not like this game until they've put about 12-15 hours into it. I'd recommend this game for anyone who liked the original Alien movie and are looking for a serious horror game to play.\n\nPros:\n- Gameplay experience - it's a huge plus for the game\n- Represents accurately the situation a desperate and desolate space station\n- The horrifying encounters with the alien\n- Sound : You'll be crapping bricks at every time a door opens, or a generator powers on, or when you turn on a switch wondering if the alien heard that. There are sounds that let you know when the alien comes down to floor from the vents or going back to the vents. They help you plan your strategy of escape\n- Music : There isn't music at a lot of places which builds up the suspense. And then suddenly there is loud dramatic music that would make your palms sweat in fear leaving you running and hiding just out of the fear\n\nCons:\n- Slow pace initially and a little bit longer story\n- Though the space station is huge, this is not an open world game. There are no side missions. The main story is the only mission you have\n- Eventhough you play as Amanda Ripley, the daughter of Ellen Ripley from the movie, the story doesn't have much connection with Ellen and you feel the protagonist can be anyone else","January 3, 2015","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The most important thing to understand about this new entry into the series is it's radical shift in game-play design from those of which were, by an large, iterations on the same game-play first experienced in Doom. And it was with no surprise that the franchise was going to take this well trodden path as the sequel to the original film in the series was John Carmack's main inspiration in developing Doom.\n\nBy diagnosing the main problem with one of videogame's most popular genres The Creative Assembly have opted to make the player feel as vulnerable as possible in order to instil a genuine sense of dread and tension throughout the game. The game doesn't allow players to horde backpacks full of guns and ammo but instead forces you to use any meager gadget you can concoct in order to distract your enemies as opposed to mowing them down with little cost to your resources or safety. There are guns introduced later in the game and surprise surprise here in lies one of the games strange inconsistencies with the Alien cannon and potential flaws in it's game-play.\n\nAfter a slow burn introduction to the Sevastopol Station, a crumbling space port in it's last stages of being decommissioned, the game starts out incredibly reminiscent of Bioshock allowing the player to venture in at their own pace discovering computers containing personal logs by Sevastopol inhabitants and audio recordings that help to organically deliver the narrative element of the game. Once further into the Sevastopol, and the main elements have been introduced, the game-play really takes off with the Alien and other enemies all working together to create a wonderfully organic emergent gameplay style that is never scripted and always seems unique throughout repeat playthroughs. And repeat playthroughs of individual missions will become commonplace to even the most seasoned and skilled players as The Creative Assembly have done something truly amazing with the AI of it's titular enemy by designing it to work with heightened sensors that enable it to respond dynamically to sound and situations as opposed to being moved on predetermined paths with basic AI programming. In short this game is ♥♥♥♥ING HARD!\n\nThe look and feel of the game is stunning, albeit it with a minimal amount of dodgy cut-scenes, poor human facial animations and shader aliasing problems, as the lighting and graphical fidelity convinces you that you are in the world of Alien, one of cinemas most stunning and meticulously designed films. The Alien's design and animations are far beyond anything I've seen in any game and it's clear where Sega have really channeled their money opting, with minor cost to less vital parts of the game, to really bring the Alien to life.\n\nHowever there are some problems with the game, although minimal, and these are down in large part to the second half of this massive game. When I say massive I can tell you it must have taken me over 25 hours to complete the game on Normal difficulty on a very exploratory play-through and once the game reached the 15 hour mark for me, which would have been an ample length for a game of this kind the Alien "goes on vacation", for the third quarter of the game, leaving you pining for it's return. Once the game finds itself without an Alien you are left to contend with the station's second most deadly entity, the Androids, who prove to be somewhat less fulfilling. The game also chooses to ignore some vital elements of the Alien's life cycle introduced by James Cameron in the second movie which I feel are to it's detriment.\n\nOn the whole Alien: Isolation is one of the most tense and claustrophobic horror stealth games I've ever experienced and I heartily recommend to it to any and all that have even the slightest interest in horror and sci-fi. Well done CA the Alien is finally back in town!","October 14, 2014","true","44.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The visual and audio presentation is "TOP-NOTCH" giving the game an authentic atmosphere remeniscent of the original motion picture "ALIEN". Character control is fluid and easy to learn and the games "QTE" sequences are kept simple and to a minimum with an ample amount of time for input and never seem to impede player progression with elaborate  button combinations.\nPlayer interactions with the titles main antagonist "THE ALIEN" are frightening, even more so because the player is given no option or resource to permenatly dispatch the beast, but rather given tools to either distract or ward off direct encounters aswell as enviromental options that allow the player to evade detection, such as "LOCKERS" and being able to crawl under "DESKS". This aspect of the gameplay mechanic adds a great deal of tension and anxiety to the experience, leaving the player feeling helpless and reluctant to conduct overt actions.\nThe titles difficulty is unprecedented aswell. Though there are three levels of difficulty to choose from, "EASY" being a more cinematic and steady paced experience allowing the player more room for error when dealing with the "ALIEN" which keeps the story content flowing more naturally, "HARD" on the other hand is an arduous and lengthy ordeal that requires "QUICK" and "CLEVER" thinking and no small amount of "PATIENCE". This however can be off-putting and frustrating to the more casual player base and because of this I wouldn't recommend this title to everyone.\nAlien: Isolations story was thoughtfully written aswell and all the events and scenario's that occur between the games relativly calm begining to the titles "controversial" end were exciting and interesting never once leaving me feel dissapointed in the experience.

I don't do reviews but this is something special worth noting.\n\nIt's is a very unique horror game and is not linear at all, unlike other horror titles I have experienced over the years such as the Dead Space Trilogy, Outlast, Resdient Evil 5 and 6. Has plenty of moments where gameplay is changed up exactly at the right time when it can almost get tedious, then throws you into a new experience. Very exhilarating and entertaining gameplay on Hard difficulty. There is some beautiful sights not just in the game environment but in the animations and some real-time cut scenes. Story has a great length for the price, which I expect in a single player experience.\n\nEDIT: Audio is absolutely incredible. Reminds me of the giant leap in audio design from EA on Battlefield : Bad Company 2.  Make sure to grab some headphones and slap the audio preset on dynamic range which is on by default I believe. The headphone preset is pretty meh.\n\nThis is my Game Of The Year 2014.\n\nGG CA.

The visual and audio presentation is "TOP-NOTCH" giving the game an authentic atmosphere remeniscent of the original motion picture "ALIEN". Character control is fluid and easy to learn and the games "QTE" sequences are kept simple and to a minimum with an ample amount of time for input and never seem to impede player progression with elaborate  button combinations.\nPlayer interactions with the titles main antagonist "THE ALIEN" are frightening, even more so because the player is given no option or resource to permenatly dispatch the beast, but rather given tools to either distract or ward off direct encounters aswell as enviromental options that allow the player to evade detection, such as "LOCKERS" and being able to crawl under "DESKS". This aspect of the gameplay mechanic adds a great deal of tension and anxiety to the experience, leaving the player feeling helpless and reluctant to conduct overt actions.\nThe titles difficulty is unprecedented aswell. Though there are three levels of difficulty to choose from, "EASY" being a more cinematic and steady paced experience allowing the player more room for error when dealing with the "ALIEN" which keeps the story content flowing more naturally, "HARD" on the other hand is an arduous and lengthy ordeal that requires "QUICK" and "CLEVER" thinking and no small amount of "PATIENCE". This however can be off-putting and frustrating to the more casual player base and because of this I wouldn't recommend this title to everyone.\nAlien: Isolations story was thoughtfully written aswell and all the events and scenario's that occur between the games relativly calm begining to the titles "controversial" end were exciting and interesting never once leaving me feel dissapointed in the experience. A truely unique title with a personality of it's own.\nI give it a 9/10 and recommend Alien: Isolation to any fan of the series and the stealth/survival horror genre.","November 10, 2014","true","218.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Love the movies, games, toys, everything.  However, this game I have a love hate thing going with it.\nFirst, what I love:  The look, the feel, the graphics.  This is all amazing.  I felt like I was right back in 79.  I wanted to adjust the tracking on the loading screens!  The crafting wasn't too bad.  Killing (when you actually GET to kill) was a blast.  Let you be very creative.  I also liked the story though it gets to the point in some places where you go, what next will you throw at me?  And another big draw.  They got the original crew back together!  That's huge.\nNow to what I hate: The Alien.  First off and this is the biggest problem I have with the game is... it doesn't work.  The alien DOESN'T!  HAVE!  EYES!!!  Hiding under a friggin' desk or behind a chair is NOT going to work.  It knows where you are.  At all times.  The other problem is that not only does the Alien now see, but it also seems to be nearsighted.  There were many instances where it would just walk right past me as I was standing in a corner.  Standing.  Out in the open.  For all to see.  Now I understand, this is how the game is played, but come on.  A poor sighted Alien is not as faithful as the rest of the game was.  The other thing I hated was that the game does not let you kill the alien but simply drive it off and erase it's short term memory.  Fire will drive it off but not kill it.  No matter how much fire or firepower to bring down on it, it will not die.  Which... makes the Alien dumb in addition to being poor sighted.  So, ok.  Fire hurts it but won't kill it, it needs to come and kill Ripley and the pain will stop.  Things aren't going to change just because it runs away to let it's carapace cool off.  I'm still going to burn it next time it finds me.  If it's so damn smart it would figure this out and just leave me the hell alone or set a trap or something.\nOverall though, I will recommend the game.  There are parts I never want to ever have to play through again but in the end I had a good time.  As I said, I both love and hate this game.","January 12, 2015","true","30.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

And I've played a lot of games...\nAs many others, I am a huge fan of the Alien movies and until now, all the Alien games I've played missed that certain touch that made the 'perfect organism' earn its title. Though the AvP series delivers its thrills and chills, Isolation really nails it. Based on the first Alien movie (the best of them all, in fact), it manages to recreate that frightful feeling that you get when you're hunted-down by the ultimate predator.\nIt has its glitches, but are so far apart and so little, that you can easily ignore them and they don't break the overall feeling.\nThough I've read in many reviews that the game is too long (SERIOUSLY?!?), I find the length and the pacing of the game just perfect. I hope Creative Assembly won't give-in to these (STUPID) comments and make the next Alien game just as lenghty. Combining the Alien moments with the 'Working Joe's' ones makes for a perfect thrill ride, with it's ups and downs, otherwise it would have become stale. I also simply loved the moment which ties the first two movies together, that was pure genius! No spoilers! ;) Also very welcome were the moments where you think you've met your doom, only to be thrown into the lion's den once more... or at least you're gonna wish it were lions, but no such luck. ;)\nBest! Game! Ever! Play it, die a lot, and I mean a lot of times! Repeat! :)\nGood job, CA, I can't wait to play all the DLCs and hope for another gem like this in the future! :)","November 23, 2014","true","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanicBacon/recommended/214490/","SatanicBacon","Reverend Recoil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanicBacon/","98 products in account","Ladies & gentleman... Here's my take on Alien: Isolation,\nI'm not one to sugarcoat a turd, or bitter up a treat, so I'm just going to lay down my impressions so far on this game for what it's worth.\n\nI'm a fan of Alien, I love the franchise. To be more specific, I'm talking about Alien-Alien 3. That being said, I can tell you in 110% confidence that the very look and feel of this game lives up to the mythology laid down in the original 1979 masterpiece by Ridley Scott. You have all the little references, familiar looking hallways, corridors, sounds, etc, the list goes on. So good job by the devs on hitting it right on the mark in that regard. Not only is the atmosphere pure and true to the source material, but it's also a terrifying experience. You can't quicksave every three steps to give yourself a constant flow of relief in the chance that you die (and you will die. A lot.) instead you have to seek out save stations similar to the old school Resident Evil games. This is a plus because it creates challenging progression. You are not going to complete this game in one night. It is hard. Currently I have yet to complete the game in it's entirety, so I'm going off of what I've experienced so far.\n\nThe first portion of the game is easy even on Nightmare difficulty (Which is what I chose to play it on for my initial runthrough) However, as soon as you enter the Medical Bay and the Alien rears it's head, ♥♥♥♥ get's ♥♥♥♥ing real. You will hide, you will crawl, you will struggle to evade, and you will die. I've made it to the Marshall's offices and let me tell you, it hasn't stopped. It keeps coming. The Alien isn't the only problem, there's these Working Joe androids that were built by some Weyland knock-off company named Seegson. These things are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They flip like a switch and go from benevolent to beat your face in 2.5, so be warned. You might be on a mission where you need to access a terminal to unlock something or whatever, and there's your trusty Working Joe asking if you need assistance. No, you're a big girl and can work it out yourself, so you proceed to the computer terminal just to find out that your trusty Android brethren decided to hulk smash your colon, strangle you, and finish you off with a brass knuckle donkey punch. Yeah that's what it feels like, you'll find out anyway.\n\nThis threat doesn't help your cause when you have another problem breathing down your neck at all times, yeah the Alien. You can manage to lose a malevolent Android, they are slower, you can hop in a locker or just creep out of view and into an airshaft. The Alien however, will kill you dead on the spot. Wanna run away? You will DIE. Wanna hide in a locker? You will DIE. Oh look, a vent shaft I can hide in! DEAD!  I hope this is getting through to you, hiding is temporary, he's going to sniff you out and do horrible things to your limp & lifeless body after he turns your butt into hamburger meat.\n\nThere is other temporary solutions, and when you combine them you'll have a longer time span to distract, evade, and charlie mike. Throw a flare, it seems to be curious about these red glowing mysteries of heat and smoke. You can also construct various contraptions using blueprints that you'll lift throughout your exploration of the space station. Noise makers, smoke bombs, etc, all will be useful in your struggle to evade this relentless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Supplies are low, so save'em when you can, utilize them when you need to, simple as that. Another trusty asset that you'll discover early on in the game is the Motion Tracker. This damn thing will become your new best friend, it'll point you where you need to go and will give you a heads up on when to get your head down. Word of advice, stow that ♥♥♥♥ if the Alien comes sniffing around your hiding place. I'm not 100% sure but I think he can hear it.\n\nSo far Alien: Isolation is realistic in it's approach, so much so that it is flipping terrifying and very challenging. This is a new take on survival horror that fans of the franchise have been waiting for. If you're looking for a blast'em up action game, then I'd recommend you feed your shallow plebeian brain some Call of Duty, or that sorry ♥♥♥ Colonial Marines game that came out a while back. If you like true Horror, take this title for a spin. Complete it on Nightmare Difficulty and my hat's off to you!\nI'll give this one a solid 9 out of 10. Good luck with your bughunt.","February 23, 2015","true","31.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics were really great and the game is very optimised for pc!\nI just love the sound and atmosphere of the game when you play, and I remember the chilling feeling of it when I think back of it. The gameplay never get boring since you have many tools to create from the items you find, to be able to breach forward from the douchy androids and protect yourself from the alien.\nThe androids and humans feels a bit scripted, but their ai is good. But when it comes to the alien... The aliens ai is not at all scripted and are terriffyingly great! It may be the smartest (and scariest) ai that I have ever encountered! In the first half of the game when I encountered the alien, it sometimes even made me turn off the game because of that I couldn't handle how scary it was when I was alone with it, with barely any items.\nI played at medium difficulty, which was challenging. But the humans and androids felt like the most AAA games dumbed down ai which can't see or hear you far away (at medium difficulty). The alien also felt a tad too easy (still challenging) even thought that its supposed to have extremely good senses. But this is because the AI IS ORGINALLY PROGRAMMED GREAT AT NIGHTMAR DIFFICULTY, but is dumbed down to certain difficulties. So if you want the ai to be the most realistic and have full potential, you should play at the hardest difficulty.\nIf I'm going to complain about something else, it would be about the facial animation of the characters sometimes. Since the facial animations can look half done; a bit stiff and some parts like the eyebrows are not animated. Eitherway the animations in the game are great.\n\nI am most likely going to replay the game in nightmare difficulty in the future, or at least a dlc :p\n9/10","February 18, 2015","true","39.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is definetely not the game for you. If you want to liken this game to anything, It's gameplay elements are more akin to some of the Hitman games, in the fact that you need to do a lot of hiding, and distraction.\n\nHowever, before you click off this review, I'd just like to say that I am not a fan of the Hitman games, but I thoroughly enjoy Alien: Isolation. Why, you might ask? It's simple. The atmosphere, and the buzz of hiding, and not being caught is astoundingly tense, and compelling. I found it a true joy, whilst at the same time being amazingly terrifying.\n\nThis game is a gem in many respects, because it's able to do what a lot of other mainstream survival horrors cannot, that is absolutely terrify the player. I mean, this game is the daddy in that department. If you're a big wuss, I definetely would NOT recommend this, also I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with a weak heart, cause it's likely to cause you a heart attack!!\n\nTo summarize:\nPros:\n- Amazingly tense\n- Terrifying, in a most gratifying way (When you escape!)\n- Terrific atmosphere (Literally, probably one of the best atmospheric games I've ever played)\n- Very true to the Alien canon (great for fans)\n- Superb graphics, and compelling story\n- It's fun to build stuff!\n- The sound in the game is amazingly tense!\n\nCons:\n- Terrifying (depends on your outlook!)\n- Pretty difficult and frustrating (Save points are sometimes spaced out which means a lot of backtracking)\n","October 14, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanicBacon/recommended/214490/","SatanicBacon","Reverend Recoil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SatanicBacon/","98 products in account","Ladies & gentleman... Here's my take on Alien: Isolation,\nI'm not one to sugarcoat a turd, or bitter up a treat, so I'm just going to lay down my impressions so far on this game for what it's worth.\n\nI'm a fan of Alien, I love the franchise. To be more specific, I'm talking about Alien-Alien 3. That being said, I can tell you in 110% confidence that the very look and feel of this game lives up to the mythology laid down in the original 1979 masterpiece by Ridley Scott. You have all the little references, familiar looking hallways, corridors, sounds, etc, the list goes on. So good job by the devs on hitting it right on the mark in that regard. Not only is the atmosphere pure and true to the source material, but it's also a terrifying experience. You can't quicksave every three steps to give yourself a constant flow of relief in the chance that you die (and you will die. A lot.) instead you have to seek out save stations similar to the old school Resident Evil games. This is a plus because it creates challenging progression. You are not going to complete this game in one night. It is hard. Currently I have yet to complete the game in it's entirety, so I'm going off of what I've experienced so far.\n\nThe first portion of the game is easy even on Nightmare difficulty (Which is what I chose to play it on for my initial runthrough) However, as soon as you enter the Medical Bay and the Alien rears it's head, ♥♥♥♥ get's ♥♥♥♥ing real. You will hide, you will crawl, you will struggle to evade, and you will die. I've made it to the Marshall's offices and let me tell you, it hasn't stopped. It keeps coming. The Alien isn't the only problem, there's these Working Joe androids that were built by some Weyland knock-off company named Seegson. These things are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They flip like a switch and go from benevolent to beat your face in 2.5, so be warned. You might be on a mission where you need to access a terminal to unlock something or whatever, and there's your trusty Working Joe asking if you need assistance. No, you're a big girl and can work it out yourself, so you proceed to the computer terminal just to find out that your trusty Android brethren decided to hulk smash your colon, strangle you, and finish you off with a brass knuckle donkey punch. Yeah that's what it feels like, you'll find out anyway.\n\nThis threat doesn't help your cause when you have another problem breathing down your neck at all times, yeah the Alien. You can manage to lose a malevolent Android, they are slower, you can hop in a locker or just creep out of view and into an airshaft. The Alien however, will kill you dead on the spot. Wanna run away? You will DIE. Wanna hide in a locker? You will DIE. Oh look, a vent shaft I can hide in! DEAD!  I hope this is getting through to you, hiding is temporary, he's going to sniff you out and do horrible things to your limp & lifeless body after he turns your butt into hamburger meat.\n\nThere is other temporary solutions, and when you combine them you'll have a longer time span to distract, evade, and charlie mike. Throw a flare, it seems to be curious about these red glowing mysteries of heat and smoke. You can also construct various contraptions using blueprints that you'll lift throughout your exploration of the space station. Noise makers, smoke bombs, etc, all will be useful in your struggle to evade this relentless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Supplies are low, so save'em when you can, utilize them when you need to, simple as that. Another trusty asset that you'll discover early on in the game is the Motion Tracker. This damn thing will become your new best friend, it'll point you where you need to go and will give you a heads up on when to get your head down. Word of advice, stow that ♥♥♥♥ if the Alien comes sniffing around your hiding place. I'm not 100% sure but I think he can hear it.\n\nSo far Alien: Isolation is realistic in it's approach, so much so that it is flipping terrifying and very challenging. This is a new take on survival horror that fans of the franchise have been waiting for. If you're looking for a blast'em up action game, then I'd recommend you feed your shallow plebeian brain some Call of Duty, or that sorry ♥♥♥ Colonial Marines game that came out a while back. If you like true Horror, take this title for a spin. Complete it on Nightmare Difficulty and my hat's off to you!\nI'll give this one a solid 9 out of 10. Good luck with your bughunt.","February 23, 2015","true","31.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/varliance/recommended/214490/","varliance","Varla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/varliance/","15 products in account","Alien: Isolation's protagonist Amanda Ripley travels to station Sevastapol as she is willing to risk everything to find out what happened to her mother. As she discovers what happened on the station through computer logs she begins to gain a deeper understanding of herself and her own morals. The harsh juxtaposition of action sequences with tranquillity in between them offers a look into the conflicting emotions Ripley is feeling between her mother and her own call of duty. Alistair Hope has carefully crafted these environments and messages throughout the game to give the player a gradual sense of self-discovery.\nAs Ripley broadens her sense of self, her personality also changes from a strict attitude to a more apathetic outlook on life. When she begins her journey she maintains a sense of duty and professionalism, and operated very much by-the-book and in accordance with the rules. After she encounters the Xenomorph through a series of traumatising events her outlook on life changes. She becomes far colder and more apathetic towards her life, resigned to the fact she had been ruined both professionally and personally by what had happened. Alistair uses emotive and blunt dictation to convey Ripley's feelings in "It's like you feel homesick for a place that doesn't exist". This reflects in the games atmosphere and music, which features less colour and is much calmer than the first sequence. This change also teaches Ripley to break away from the rules, as shown when she fearlessly volunteered to trap the Xenomorph in a remote section of the station. She was able to break away from the conventions of her personality and embrace the unknown through journey.\n\nYup, english essays are fun.","April 1, 2015","true","36.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is to a large part true, but this is true even of Ellen Ripley in the movie.\nWhen I generously look at scenes from Alien Isolation, I can appreciate the subtle ways Amanda deals with some situations,  like when she first runs into Axel, as she is thinking about how to not escalate the tension and try to reason with a person she isn´t sure can even be reasoned with. Or the scene where she tries to get Ricardo to focus on getting back to figuring out how to get them out of there, as he is scared and frozen after what happened to with the androids, a scene reminiscent of Ellen getting Hudson in Aliens to focus and get back to finding out ways to seal the aliens off from getting to them.\nThese are small examples of the different ways you are reminded of how Amanda is related to Ellen, and they can be appreciated, but it is understandable that some demand more character development, though I am happy that most people still behaved semi rationally or reasonably panicked on Sevastopol station, horror movies aren´t exactly known for their likeable cannon fodder you can relate to and think to yourself that you might have done the same thing in their situations - Alien being one of the rare exceptions, so again it recreates that sense of the people still trying their best and even having some good plans, but still failing infront of the unstoppable alien terror.\nThese are the ways I liked the plot, the creators obviously tried to hit many of the themes from the movie, with some spacewalks, some explorations which made sense in the plot but still was clearly put in because of how much the devs wanted to have as much from Alien as possible, and as an alien fan I did appreciate the game just taking the movie and expanding upon it.\nAlso liked that the Working Joes Androids were creepy cheap knock-offs from WY, but also that it had a good android almost like Bishop, breaking the familiar stereotype of all human technology being black-or-white evil to the core.\n\nThe weakest part is the ending. It is a cliffhanger with a QTE event. QTEs are practically nonexistent in the game. Now it is clear from all the passion put in, the attention to detail, the lovingly crafted atmopshere and effort behind the execution, that the devs in Creative Assembly are fans, and they wanted to set out to make the alien game they always felt the movies deserved, and they had the core ideas, the resources and they knew how to set up the game, but I get the sense that it didn´t occur to them that one day, their passion would come to an end, that they would need to wrap things up, it seems like they were so immersed in creating the game that when it came time to have the story arc discussed and get some of that closure, either they didn´t know how to address it, or they were reluctant to contemplate the prospect of closing it.\n\nEnough about the story.\nGameplay is very reliant on the atmosphere, on multiple factors coming together, not one gimmick, though arguably if someone wanted to suggest the game having a gimmick it would be the AI, but I don´t think that argument works, since the AI also works alongside the other elements, the dynamic sound system, the lighting, and the vulnerability of the player versus the unstoppable alien, the ingredients create the scenes when they all come together.\nI was unsure if I´d like a game where I cannot kill the alien, where I am vulnerable and need to rely on hiding and hoping the alien doesn´t see me, or else dying on the spot. But I do like it, it makes sense, the tension is fun and for the most part the encounters with the alien work with a logic; the alien has senses, it listens and looks around, and the player needs to be aware about their own noise levels and line-of-sight, this makes it easier to accept when you´ve been sloppy and the alien gets a scent of you and kills you, as you can look back and understand what went wrong, less arbitrary videogame logic and more grounded rules the system works with. And doing something right also felt more rewarding, I didn´t feel like I gained the system, or found any loopholes in the AI pathing system to exploit, but the reasoning and work inside the laws the game operates within payed off.\nThe game does have some bugs, I fortunately avoided many, but I did run into some afterimages of tools and weapons floating in midair, fixed by switching back-and-forth to them, and the Alien sometimes did get stuck in vents, though I "fixed" it by poking the alien, promptly dying for displaying my concern for the ungrateful git.\nYou have tools available, and they do serve some purpose, even at either distracting hostiles or killing them, though the alien you can at best fend off for a moment. Direct contact with hostiles is discouraged.\nThe Alien AI is something I´ve been fascinated by, it can be quite unpredictable at times, have freedoms of movement and choices in where to go and what to do, and the devs knew that to evoke the unknown terror of the Alien as seen in the original movie, it needed to have some degrees of unpredictability and emergent behaviour. So it hunts, stalks, or goes away, and shows up, sometimes at surprising moments.\nThere´s some modding going on and I´ve been looking into making the Alien a bit more unpredictable.\n\nGraphically the game looks gorgeous. It runs on my laptop, an intel core i7-4710HQ 2.5GHz, 12GB RAM, Nvidia GT840M 2GB Windows 8.1, with settings at a mosaic of ultra and off settings (motion blur, depth of field and chromatic aberration I can do without in games) on an acceptable resolution of 1280x720 at 60fps for 80~% of the time. Had no problems so feels like a good port (especially since it allowed me to tailor what options to enable). The lighting, the sound, the environments, all are made with such care for the source material, that you will feel like you are walking along sets of the original movie, heck, buy the Crew Expendable DLC and you do get to walk around the Nostromo.\nThe Alien is magnificent, its movements, behaviour, the way it looks, all worthy of such an iconic creature by H.R. Giger.\nThis is a game true to the movies, and true to one of the best of films in horror scifi.","April 15, 2015","true","84.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Except worse, because there IS something chasing you, and it's a big, scary alien.\n\nI waited until the game was at a good sale price before picking it up, however after completing it, I would say it would have been worth it at full price.\n\nIf you haven't seen the movie, or if it's been a while, I highly recommend watching it before playing. The audio and visual elements of the game are beautifully crafted, and pull directly from the film, with many subtle (and some not-so-subtle) tips of the hat to the original cinematic masterpiece.\n\nThe graphics are very pleasing, the engine is wonderfully optimized, and should run very well even without a top of the line PC.\n\nMy personal favorite part of this game is the audio. The musical score does a fantastic job of building tension, and seamlessly informs you when danger is lurking, not only without breaking immersion, but while adding to it. What could have been a boring 30 second wait for a tram, becomes an anxiety filled moment of "Please please get here faster" as the creepy string music continues to rise, while you can hear the Alien stomping around somewhere nearby. Which brings me to the next element this game uses excellently:\n\nURGENCY. There are many "mini-puzzles" in this game that you will need to complete in order to activate a computer, open a door, etc. However, while you are completing these simple puzzles, the game does not pause. Need to read through a computer terminal to find a PIN number? The Alien is still hunting for you. Need to manually punch in that PIN number to open a door? You'll need quick fingers because the Alien could be stomping up right behind you. Even while using a save point, or crafting items, the Alien continues to hunt. Some people may not like these elements, but for me they worked perfectly as intended, building tension and a sense of urgency.\n\nThe Alien's AI is very smart, and worse (or better, depending on how you look at it): random. There will be no set path it will follow, so you will never feel like you're completely safe (and you're not). Even hiding in a locker, or under a desk, if the alien was nearby when you entered, it may have seen where you went.\n\nAltogether I highly recommend this game for any fans of the Horror / Survival genre's, as well as any fans of the Alien movies.","January 19","true","24.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathlessOne/recommended/214490/","DeathlessOne","Death","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathlessOne/","95 products in account","This game was a refreshing and welcome addition to my library of horror-survival games in that it steps out of the mainstream fit of an emphasis on combat when stealth fails. The staple of games such as the Resident Evil series, and the more recent Metro 2033 series, where combat is deemed a necessity. Here, combat is more of a last resort, and weaponry / ammo is quite rare.\n\nAlien Isolation is an immersive, endless and well scripted dimension of raw fear. Having an indestructible predator on your heels in a rich, realistic environment reminiscent of an actual decommisioned space station where your senses of hearing and movement are actual game mechanics you can't overlook is excellently implemented. Paying attention to the environmentat acoustics is refreshingly frightening, and hgaving to observe your environment for clues on hiding spots and entry points for progress instead of a scripted map as staple games have done ensures you're permanently on edge. Amd that is good art that leaves a lasting impression.\n\nSome minor gripes are the repetitive layout(s) and backtracking. However, they cannot make this game any less worth playing.\n\nIf you have a VR headset, please play this game with it, and good luck.\n\nIndividual section ratings:\n\n1. Graphics:\n\nModern, well balanced, looks good, however, System requirements are friendly, and any mid-range gaming rig should handle this on Ultra without a problem. Minor glitches observed with aliasing. Very noticeable, adjust antialiaing manually from your GPU's control panel if necessary. TXAA not recommended, use FXAA as a last resort. Sweet spot is 4XMSAA.\n\n2. Gameplay:\n\nSee notes above. Freaking excellent.\n\n3. Acoustics / Sound:\n\nExcellent. Whoever worked on the sound in this game took no shortcuts and pulled off a major feat. Its' simply perfect and well integrated into the game mechanics. The sound here pulls no punches.\n\nOverall rating: 100/10. Go get this game, period.\n\nPS: Vents aren't as safe as advertised. You'll get munched. A lot. Save frequently. And if something sounds off, believe it.\nAlso, prepare to die. A lot.\nNo one will hear you rage quit in space though.\nThe usage of a VR headset is at your own discretion.","March 30, 2015","true","80.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics were really great and the game is very optimised for pc!\nI just love the sound and atmosphere of the game when you play, and I remember the chilling feeling of it when I think back of it. The gameplay never get boring since you have many tools to create from the items you find, to be able to breach forward from the douchy androids and protect yourself from the alien.\nThe androids and humans feels a bit scripted, but their ai is good. But when it comes to the alien... The aliens ai is not at all scripted and are terriffyingly great! It may be the smartest (and scariest) ai that I have ever encountered! In the first half of the game when I encountered the alien, it sometimes even made me turn off the game because of that I couldn't handle how scary it was when I was alone with it, with barely any items.\nI played at medium difficulty, which was challenging. But the humans and androids felt like the most AAA games dumbed down ai which can't see or hear you far away (at medium difficulty). The alien also felt a tad too easy (still challenging) even thought that its supposed to have extremely good senses. But this is because the AI IS ORGINALLY PROGRAMMED GREAT AT NIGHTMAR DIFFICULTY, but is dumbed down to certain difficulties. So if you want the ai to be the most realistic and have full potential, you should play at the hardest difficulty.\nIf I'm going to complain about something else, it would be about the facial animation of the characters sometimes. Since the facial animations can look half done; a bit stiff and some parts like the eyebrows are not animated. Eitherway the animations in the game are great.\n\nI am most likely going to replay the game in nightmare difficulty in the future, or at least a dlc :p\n9/10","February 18, 2015","true","39.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then you should get this game and try it out. This is the definitive Alien game of all time and is easily the best in terms of storytelling, graphics, production values, sound, atmosphere etc. Now as all creations have their issues, so does this. However this is by far the best out there and the issues that are there will not ruin your game for you in terms of the overall experience. This game is in fact one of the most atmospheric and suspenceful games ever created! It is a gem in it's own little world. The other good thing about this game is that Creative Assembly understood to avoid the problems other movie franchise games often fail at. They deliberately designed the game to be similar in aspects to film but keep free of meddling with the lore or tangle themselves in to the movies plots which is often fatal as seen in the infamous Colonial Marines of 2013. This game follows Ripley's daughter and that besides the creature alien is all that ties the writers of this game down. Therefore they don't have to worry about butchering the story of the films or ruining peoples fond nostalgic memories of the iconic films. They are free to explore ideas and gameplay story wise without having to break the original concept.\n\nThis shows brains behind whoever went into thinking how this game should approach things. Eerily this game shares a lot with it's utterly failed predecessor Colonial Marines. Colonial Marines got patching after patching and after extensively playing that one, I was shocked to find eerily similar Nostromo map here + other similarities as if the makers of Isolation had actually went in and studied what was a failure in Marines and what worked (hardly anything with exception to maps) And pick and choose what to do properly in this game. There are a lot of things that I've found similar with this game with the obvious exception that Marines did them without soul and implemented poorly and this game took the idea and put serious effort and understanding into what they were making and why. ACM has a Stasis Interrupted DLC and in it are similarities with this (Blowing up the ship sequence) Obviously this one does not have the action based dynamics of ACM but it isn't purely Ridely Scotts Alien either. It feels like an amalgamation between the two with heavy leaning towards the mechanics of the original Alien film. Suspence rather than action, yet it's not Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell with aliens either. This game is faster in terms of pacing than Mr.Scott's original classic, and that's where you feel the amalgamation with other alien films. The faster pacing does not mean the game is short, by all means this game will give your money's worth. Maybe even too much depending on the gamers preference. As to my guessing of whether the similarities I find in ACM and this one (not gameplay wise) Are in fact real or not, I do however think no one in the gaming world could escape the abysmal sensation of ACM and it's aftermath. So in that sense I would consider a possibility of makers of Isolation to actually compare and try and figure out WHAT NOT TO DO here.\n\nAll in all it will be interesting to see whether CA can succesfully go forward with a good start and make this even better for DLC or even sequel. If they listen what people found frustrating with this yet understanding the good, they should at least be able to streamline the experience even more. Now if the next step would be similar to James Cameron's version but again with the understanding of not jumping in and trying to replicate the exact experience and end up spoiling it, but rather have the mood, atmosphere, ideas but not necessarily same people, locations etc. So that it stays fresh and free from breaking the past. That would be COOL in my books! Now we have the thriller version of Alien in videogame form, next step would logically be the suspence action ride of Aliens! Here's hoping!","March 23","true","41.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

Alien Isolation not only proved me wrong, but it is one of the most terrifying games I've ever played.\n\nThere are two things that Alien Isolation gets right when it comes to survival horror.\n\nThe first is that the Alien is un-killable.  Many survival horror games rely on the player killing off their enemies (i.e. Dead Space, Resident Evil).  I've always felt that this diminishes the horror aspect, especially as the player often gets more proficient as the game wears on.  In Alien Isolation, while you can defend yourself against the Alien, you can never eliminate it.  It will always come back.\n\nScripted scares are also a staple of the survival horror genre.  However, scripted scares diminish once you know when to expect them.  And while this game does feature its share of scripted moments, the Alien in the game operates both at random and based on reactions to the environment.  The player is never exactly sure what will happen and often this resulted in unpredictable, yet incredibly cinematic moments.\n\nIn one instance, I was being pursued by a hostile guard who had shot at me.  I escaped down a corridor into a dead end.  I peaked out from the room to see the guard slowly making his way towards me.  At that exact moment, the door behind the guard opened up to reveal the hulking silhouette of the Alien, having been attracted by the gunshots.  I ducked my head back into the room to hide while listening to the dying screams of the guard.  It was one of the most singularly cinematic moments in the game and yet completely unscripted.\n\nGraphically, this game is gorgeous.  Having re-watched the original Alien recently, I was amazed at painstaking effort the designers took to recreate the designs from the film.  Everything from the grills on the lights, the design of the vents, to the prevalence of CRT screens and giant buttons, this game is a beautiful homage to the film.\n\nIf the graphics are amazing, the sound design is on another level.  This game relies heavily on terrifying the player by what they can often hear, but not always see.  From the Alien's thudding footsteps to the steady beeps of the motion tracker, the sound design is just fantastic.\n\nIf the game does have its weaknesses, it is in the narrative, pacing and some of the mechanics.  Puzzle-wise, the game isn't much more than a door-opening simulator.  There are some "hacking" mini-games involving matching up symbols or timing button presses.  But overall, it's basic stuff.  The narrative isn't particularly compelling either.  There's an Alien on board, people are terrified, and in the most cliche twist in the Alien universe, the Weyland-Utani corporation is involved.  It's not the most compelling story, but it serves as the basic framework for the player's action.\n\nAlien Isolation is a stellar game.  While it does have weaknesses, it's aesthetics and ability to invoke sheer terror more than make up for it.  If you like survival horror, don't pass up this game.","December 13, 2015","true","22.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In this review i will cover some basics about the game, things i enjoyed, things that i didn't like so much, my final statement and a score out of 100.\n\nSo to start with, there are many aspects of this game that make it great, and these in my opinion outweigh the bad points completely. We've seen many game titles under the Alien and Predator franchises such as the action based AVP and the James Cameron take on Colonial Marines, where we had big guns, trained marine allies and a bad attitude. Alien Isolation however, attempts to re-install the original terror and fear we had of the Ridley Scott's monster. It does this by stripping you, the player, down to the extreme basics. You don't have any prior survival or combat training, you're simply just a human stuck on a very large broken spaceship with no way off.\n\nThe game is a survival horror, meaning you basically have to make the best of a very bad situation and do whatever it takes to survive. So let's talk about your options:\n\nAs Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley, you are trained in mechanics to some extent, and you can use this to your advantage by picking up world items and combining them to create devices or medical supplies. You can create smoke bombs to escape sticky situations, noisemakers to distract enemies while you slip by unnoticed and EMP mines to deal with the on board crazy synthetic androids and many more. You will find guns as you progress through the story line, but you will quickly realize that they are only a final resort. Ammo is very scarce for anything other than the Flamethrower and they are almost entirely useless against the Alien and the tough Androids. They are however, suitable methods of dealing with the crazed population of humans quickly.\n\nThe Alien: The Alien is the star of this game, it's the big bad boss which you cannot fight, all you can do is hide from it and prey that it doesn't find you. You can use crafted devices to lure it out of your way, but if you choose to do this too often, the alien will wise up and stop playing ball. For example, you could throw a flare across the room, and the Alien would follow it and become mesmerized by it for a short while. The next flare you throw, the Alien may see it and already know what it is, so there is no need for it to examine it or walk over to it. The next time, you may find that the alien instead of looking at the flare, it turns and tries to find the source of where it came from, so if you don't move, then you're basically screwed.\n\nStealth and Sneaking: The game is largely based of sneaking around and hiding. In the world there are many places the player can choose to hide, such as lockers, under beds and under desks. These are all a temporary solution, because if the Alien catches a glimpse of you, or hears a noise in your area, it is going to stay around allot longer, giving you less time and opportunity to move away.\n\nPros:\n\nThe Fear: My favorite thing about this game, was the constant feel of dread. The Alien is progressively hunting Amanda throughout the game after a certain point, meaning you're never truly sure if you're safe or not. There are points in which the alien is scripted to appear, but it doesn't entirely keep to just scripted events. On your motion tracker, you occasionally see movement quickly dart over your head through the vents system. This is not a world ambiance mechanic at all, because if you make enough noise, no matter where you are, the Alien will appear to punish you. Death in this game from the Alien is 80% of the time instant. Once it's seen you, if you don't have a flame thrower, or some kind of explosive, then you are going to die straight away. Once it's got hold of you, you're dead.\n\nThe Clever AI: The Aliens AI is by far the most advanced artificial intelligence I've ever seen. It responds to sound, sight and maybe even possibly smell. However, it mainly works off sound. The Alien doesn't let up either, because if it hears you in a certain area, it will refuse to move away until it's caught you, leaving you with few choices such as: Duck, cover, crawl, progress or distracting it.\n\nThe Length: For a 60$ game, you would expect a double figure in the amount of playtime. For me it took 15 hours, for others I've heard it take upward of 20 hours. It all depends on how you play and the difficulty. I played through on medium because i suck at stealth games, but i did surprisingly well and made progress very fast as i refused to stick around in areas where the alien was.\n\nSurvival mode: This mode is great for scaring your friends. It throws you into a small area with a couple of missions to beat and a roaming Alien. There's also a timer, putting pressure on you to get the best time. You're given some basic supplies and craftables, and a Flamethrower with a few good shots. It's a great competitive mode to play with friends, and it is the first mode you should show to anyone new.\n\nCons:\n\nThe Story itself: While the length of the game in my opinion was perfect, it could have benefited from a better story line. Although another survival horror title "Dead Space 1" borrowed heavily off the concepts in the original film, this game felt like it then heavily borrowed off Dead Space's actual plot. You're an engineer, you get stranded on the ship, and then you're apparently the only person left out of hundreds of still alive people that have probably been on the station for years of their working life, that knows how to fix the station. And fixing the ship basically consists of walking to different areas, pulling leavers and pressing buttons. Is there seriously no one else who knows how to do this on the station?\n\nHumans: Some of the humans on board the ship are friendly, and they will pose no threat to you at all. Some of them are scared, and will make you back off at all costs. Some are just plain stupid and will shoot at you at first sight. I didn't like this so much, as i was hoping human encounters would have been much more diverse and unscripted. You can however, hide nearby and listen to their conversations to gauge what kind of people they are, and whether you should approach or not. But the most common outcome is they just shoot on sight, which can be stressful. With most human encounters, it's better to usually just summon the alien through noise and let him deal with them. A nice touch was though that you can actually play the game without killing a single human. You can sneak past them, avoid them or just get the Alien to deal with them.\n\nOverall, Alien Isolation has become one of my favorite games, I've already began replaying the story to see what else i can find, and I've also yet to play and finish both DLC's "Crew Expendable" and "Last survivor". While i think the Story itself is a bit of a let down, it makes up for it with it's insanely awesome gameplay mechanics. I didn't feel bored at any point of it.\n\nI give Alien Isolation a 92/100. Great gameplay, great concept and execution, however, the story and human encounters are a let down.\n\nI'll have this review posted to this channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkuDQ7u1n8AVOD9mY1Ib6-w/feed in video format in the near future.","October 11, 2014","true","61.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Fans of things like Amnesia, Outlast, Penumbra, etc will find a common game mechanic in hiding as your main form of defense. You -do- get some weapons and tools but I will get into those a little later.\n\nYou play Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley from the original film. You are looking for the blackbox from the Nostromo which you heard was recently recovered in search of your mother. This opens up some nice Nostromo logs which help reference the original film more.\n\nYou spend most of the game either hiding from the alien or combating androids.\n\nWeapons such as a stun baton, maintenance jack, revolver, shotgun and boltgun are all effective against androids. The alien is best combated via stealth and planned movement. A handful of distractions and saves exist versus the alien...noisemakers, flares, smoke bombs, etc...which I found I never used. Molotovs and the flamethrower cause the alien to retreat into the nearest vent giving you roughly 3 - 5 seconds of freedom to move before the alien returns.\n\nGameplay-wise there is nothing special here. It's the world that Alien takes place in that makes the game amazing. From the growls of the alien on the prowl to the glow of android eyes models are fantastic to look at. Key animations and movements from the original film make an appearance that Alien fans will enjoy. The motion tracker is solid and easy to read. The station, derelict, space and vent ducts are all highly authentic to the universe and feel like you are stepping into it yourself.\n\nI was highly reserved coming into this so I was pleasently surprised with how entertained I was. Aside from ID tag / log hunting this game really is a one shot wonder like most story games. I definitely recommend picking it up for $40 or less. The value is there and this might end up being my Game of the Year.\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 6, 2014","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can only submit short reviews right now and need to edit to get them longer.\n\nContrary to the game's description, this is not really a survival game. Sure, the goal is not to die, but that is true of a very large number of games. What this game actually is is a highly scripted stealth action fps horror game which often plays like a groundhog day nightmare (die a horrible death, but learn where enemies are so you can hopefully get a little farther before dying again).\n\nWith that out of the way, I want to say that I wanted to like this game. Being able to explore a space station is a lot of fun, and the metroidvania item progression to unlock new parts of the station had a lot of potential. Unfortunately, this game does have some major issues that ultimately shifted my perception away from fun to annoyance by the time I was done with the game.\n\nFirst off, the good points. The atmosphere is perfect for an Aliens game, and the (somewhat) freeform Metroidvania exploration was a nice touch where getting new items would unlock new areas to explore. You have guns, but are heavily incentivized to use stealth due to the severely limited ammo and not wanting to attract attention.\n\nNow (unfortunately) to the bad points. Note that I was playing on Novice in hopes of minimizing these so take into account that they will be exacerbated on higher difficulties.\n\nThe checkpoint saving system is a PITA. When there are many things that can very quickly kill you, and the heavy stealth focus making for often slow progress, it can easily be 15-20 minutes between checkpoints (even taking into account backtracking to find one). Deaths mean a significant time loss and significantly contributed to my annoyance. The amount of time you stand starting blankly at the save points watching the lights is also completely unnecessary.\n\nGuns are in desperate need of a rebalance. The first gun you get (the revolver) is so pathetically weak (even on novice) and takes so long to reload as to be essentially useless. Either it needed to be significantly more powerful or should have been replaced with a semi-auto pistol with larger clips and faster reloads. The flamethrower goes through fuel too quickly (unless you think a quick half-second burst should use a full liter of fuel) but at least ammo is relatively plentiful in spite of that annoyance. The shotgun has way too loose of a spead (this unfortunately is a sin propogated by far too many shooters) and the bolt gun has too large of a reticle so it's only useful at shotgun ranges anyways. Pipe bombs aren't considered weapons by the weapon scanners (there's a mission where you have to leave your guns behind) but are by far the most powerful means of killing things in the game. Plus, the materials to build them are much more common than ammo.\n\nThe battery eating flashlight trope seriously needs to die. Even in the relatively power hungry flashlights of years past they lasted significantly longer than they do in this (and far to many other) games. Flashlight use is discouraged enough as is with the extra attention it draws. At least there's only a handful of places in the game that are actually dark enough to need the flashlight.\n\nQuicktime events and minigames add nothing to games like this and only serve to add another layer of annoyance, forcing you to master a pesky little timed button pushing game that adds no real content. A lot of AAA games from this era did this unfortunately, hopefully they got enough negative feedback to convince the devs not to include it so much in future titles. The computer terminals and rewires don't pause the game and lock you in while using them with no quick way out, so it's very easy to die even if you hear an enemy coming up behind you. When you do abort, you completely log out so it takes a significant amount of time to get back in if you managed to survive being interrupted.\n\nThe AI can be very inconsistent. Sometimes they're completely oblivious to your presence, other times they see you from what seems like a mile away. All the enemies exhibit this behavior. The alien has the ability to teleport to your location and randomly appear out of nowhere, killing you so often that it ceases to be scary and simply becomes aggravating.\n\nThe scripted events are also quite annoying. There are quite a few scripted events that drag you out of control (or simply are abused to provide a cheap jump scare that you'll be numb to by the end) and put you on a sometimes lengthy detour that doesn't really add anything. The entire ending sequence (between extending the maintence platform and releasing the clamps is a prime example of this, and felt entirely unnecessary.\n\nNormally I applaud a game for having lots of content provided I'm having fun, but this game overall felt like it had overstayed its welcome by the end and did not need to be as long as it was. The Metroidvania elements were ultimately wasted by the end since there wasn't really an indication of when it would be a good time to go back and visit the rooms I couldn't get into before, and now that I've been annoyed I'm not about to go back and replay to go find everything.\n\nOverall, not a bad game per se, but definitely needed another rebalance and editing pass. It's a decent stealth horror game so pick it up on sale if you like those types of games or are an Aliens fan, otherwise stay away. Not really worth the full asking price IMHO.","June 5","false","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toadni/recommended/214490/","toadni","Toad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toadni/","109 products in account","This game has a feel for the new when it comes to the Alien franchise. For me, Alien: Isolation was a 15 hour struggle of cat and mouse, the alien hunting me down and sniffing me out; the impact of the first few encounters with the monster felt huge.\n\nThe game's been a critical success, getting a lot of great press and making many game of the year lists. Steam at the moment of writing has 5000+ reviews logged which are flagged as 'very positive'. I too would agree, this a great game – outstanding really – but certainly not without its problems which I found close to immersion breaking.\n\nI enjoyed the way the game forces you to sneak. It suits the narrative of the game and makes your controlled protagonist's actions seem believable. I believe Amanda Ripley would sneak around this space station, the survivors and androids being relatively unpredictable along with the alien being lethal. You sneak to avoid the risk of alarm and I thought this was very fitting.\n\nOn the other hand, I found constantly sneaking around very tiresome. The alien controls the pacing of the game far too much and as a player you're forced to go along with how the AI has been developed. Stay still and the games pacing is wrecked - move too fast and you get punished. I found it frustrating that the AI seemingly does not adapt to the individual player but rather, you find yourself adapting to the AI's systems.\n\nThe uncertainty of the games rules is interesting; throw a flare and distract the alien for a while knowing that it's now close in your vicinity and can potentially hunt you down. Yet after a while the game does show fault here. With enough subtlety and patience you can sneak past any threat.\n\nThe narrative is paperthin, and I think it's the games rules which cause a very undercooked story. I focused on saving my game far too much than what was going on in the world. Ripley's own story became tedious for me, as my biggest objective was saving the game. Really, the game became a save-area-loot style game, with the story not mattering much.\n\nTension is a huge part of Alien: Isolation, and the game creates an amazingly tense atmosphere through the aliens empowerment and your lack of power over the creature.\n\nHowever, this focus on challenge to create tension was another problem for me. It made the game feel extremely linear and I didn't explore the world much because of the constant threat. My influence in the game world didn't matter so long as I could save the game. The actual narrative itself is not so great either. Frankly, I did not care much for Amanda Ripley or her crew – which is surprising because the world of Alien: Isolation is teeming with nuggets of info and audio dialogs.\n\nIf the narrative does not drive this game – and it really doesn't – then it's about putting the player into situations against the alien and having that play out. Indeed, that is enthralling and quite incredible at times. But the games length also turns this into tedium.\n\nIt must be said, none of the above is game breaking either. This the first 'survival-horror' game I've played and truly enjoyed in many years (since maybe the first Resident Evil). The atmosphere of the game is wonderful and visually its jaw-droppingly faithful to the 1979 classic. Incidentally, I'm not a huge fan of the film, yet the visual similarities to Ridley Scott's universe in Alien: Isolation are breathtaking.\n\nDespite the problems above, this is a fine game for reasons already explained in the dozens of reviews found elsewhere.","January 1, 2015","true","16.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

To start with this is a survival horror game to say in the most definitive terms. Essentially the whole station is full of angry redneck personel on the deck alongside a hungry hungry alien who picks everyone off. As much as I wanted to enjoy this the interface was clunky. Aquiring blueprints to craft items is an ok idea but I would of prefer a lot more usable items since you are quite literly running and hiding for your life.\n\nAtmosphere really is captured, 10/10 and the use of old cassettes, rewiring ect is great. Even the intro of the 20th century was a nice touch though I really really really can not stand not being able to escape those publisher advertisng at the start of the game. I really hated the game for this and any game for that matter.\n\nOne of my biggest drawbacks was also item usage, the amount of guiding to open latch A, turn to unlock B drove me insane. I also have disputes over the actual personal considering the amount of firepower on the station agaist a single alien, it surpises me that that massive space station is in such chaos when they could of easily taken down 1 alien.\n\nSuprisingly after Rome Total War 2 being an utter disaster and the large feedback of Aliens colonel Marines being one of the biggest public shams with its falsified demo I had little hope for this game. I am going to recommend this one just for those who enjoyed the game FEAR. I would not recommend those who enjoyed thief 1-3 , Dishonored, Deadspace simply due to the nature of combat and violece in comparison.\n\nI also would not recommend this game to those who wanted something like the film Aliens (2nd film) who want to shoot a lot of stuff up with trained marines, hopefully they can build something from this but I dont give my hopes up.\n","December 2, 2014","true","6.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not really a big issue more of a warning to those wanting to buy the game; aim your throws carefully.","October 18, 2014","true","20.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It did what a good horror game should do and scared me.  It did what a good film license should do and was faithfull to the license, while extending the licensed universe in a way that was consitant with it and good for gameplay.\n\nOn one occasion the game uses a flashback to let you take part in events in the Alien universe that they could not shoe horn into the main plot, which is inconsistant with the rest of the game, but had this Alien fanboy squeeling with delight.\n\nThe levels, interfaces, ambience were spot on recreations of the set and props from the Alien movie.  I could not be more pleased in this regard.  The graphical and acustic fidelity are amazing, attention to detail right down to animating the coulds of the gas giant that is hanging outside the window.  Isolation has some scary and beautifull set peices.\n\nI am one of those players that likes the whole "use both mouse button then press down" to pull a big lever that requires boith hands.  This kind of mechanic is used effectively several times throughout the game,\n\nOn the down-side, I never found a use for 80% of the stuff you can craft, so I was collecting and building but rarely using.    The whole crafting and inventory system felt rather awkward and clunky, which I blame on cross platform controls.   The game has some incosistancies when interacting with tech, some levers you use with "E" and some you "RMB + Down" and these levers look just the same.\n\nNot sure that I like the fixed save points, but I guess they really are for the best or I would have been spamming the quick save key every six feet.\n\nThe final gameplay is a series of previously un-used quick time events, this is the worst way to end a game.  In terms of story telling the ending felt a little off, neither a proper crecendo nor a fade out.  Not sure if I would replay it, but I would recommand it to fans of sci-fi horror.","February 1, 2015","true","22.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So, what to expect in this game is some HARDCORE stealth and fast thinking! If you don't like a challenge and/or hate the Alien series, MOVE ON NOOB!!!\nHowever, I will recommend this game to almost anyone. If you like the Alien series, you are in for a REAL treat! I will not spoil what you will find in the game, but I will say that the Alien is increadibly smart!!!! It will learn your movements, it does not run on a set path, and it WILL FIND YOU!!!! Your adrenaline will be running so hard that when you go to enter the code into a door, you will quite often enter it wrong because of pure fear. That's just how very well this game is made! The graphics & effects are BEAUTIFUL!!! Even on lower graphics cards, you will not be disappointed. It's very well refined and even follows the Alien move deleted scenes that I had long forgotten. So worth the time and SO worth the money. NO REGRETS HERE!!!!! Curious? Try it and see for yourself!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacobb/recommended/214490/","jacobb","Chandler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacobb/","1336 products in account","Fantastic game.\n\nThe first thing that deserves mention is the homage it pays to its source material. Everything in Alien: Isolation looks like it was ripped directly out of the movie. All of the aesthetics-- the visuals, the sound, the music, all spot on. The computers especially. CA totally nailed it.\n\nThe game itself is great, but not perfect. Like most stealth games, the AI is lacking at times, but that is to be expected. Mechanically, it is all very sound. The controls, weapons, actions, animations, etc are all very consistent and work well. The crafting system seems a bit unnecessary, but doesn't take away from the game. I expereinced very few bugs the entire game. Maybe two minor graphical errors.\n\nThe campaign is pretty lengthy (~15 hours for me), and the survival mode offers quite a bit more replay value. I picked up the season pass too, but haven't played any of that content yet. It assuredly adds even more to do.\n\nAnyway, if you're into Alien at all, or sci-fi stealth/survival games, you should definitely give this a go.","April 25, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

You take the role of Amanda Ripley, Ellen Ripley's daughter, in her quest to find out what happened to her mother.  The first thing you'll experience with this game is its atmosphere.  It perfectly recreates the look and feel of the first Alien film with its retro-futuristic claustrophobic environments.  It's such an aesthetically beautiful game that you'll often find yourself marvelling at the various elements within the environments while a 'Working Joe' or the Alien runs you down (well not the Working Joes, they just walk you down).\n\nThe gameplay itself is highly innovative taking mechanics we're used to, like firing a pistol, and tweaking them that adds to the true horror experience.  Using tools and weapons in A:I takes up valuable time and/or resources forcing you to strategize effective choices that will see you to the end of the game.  For example when aiming the revolver you have to wait a small amount of time for the reticule decrease in size maximizing your accuracy, but while this is happening your target/s are advancing and they certainly take more than one well aimed bullet to put down.  "Do you have enough time to aim, shoot, reload, aim before they get you?"\n\nEven the simple 'Save' mechanic has been overhauled to give an experience that at times is utter horrifying.  There’s nothing quite like hearing those heavy Alien footsteps getting louder and louder as the 'Save Station' slowly beeps through its progress.  Often you'll also approach a 'Save Station' to see, "SAVE PROGRESS - HOSTILES NEARBY".  "Hmmmmmm." you'll think to yourself.\n\nThe main enemies are the 'Working Joes' and the 'Alien' both of which have their own unique behaviours that you will have to figure out in order to overcome.  But I will not spoil you guys with that information as understanding how to deal with these two enemies is part of the adventure and the longer it takes you to figure them out the longer you'll be afraid for.  But what I will say is that both enemies are fantastic elements within the game.  The 'Working Joes' are by far the creepiest humanoids I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with in a game.  With their Michael Myer faces and their robotic voices they still fill me with dread even after 70 hours of game time.  The Alien on the other hand is an unpredictable force of nature that will force you to whimper under the hospital bed every time it pops out.  But even that is sometimes not enough, in A:I no hiding spot is permanent, if you stay under that bed or in the locker long enough the Alien will rather unceremoniously rip you right out of there adding to the constant fear of being utterly helpless at times.\n\nReinforcing the experience of Sevastopol is its sounds.  From the slight humming of the ambience to the distant shriek of a ventilated Alien, A:I completely hits all the nails on the head.  With the audio nothing is left to doubt, you know what’s around you just by keeping your ears open and constantly your reminded that you’re in a hostile environment.  If you can't hear the alien moving around the vents above you, then it’s the sound of something on Sevastopol failing that you'll most likely have to deal with later.\n\nThen, to hit it all home is the story which is fantastic to say the least.  Not only will you unfold Amanda's story through the main quest line, but you'll also uncover many backstories through logs, data entries and dead bodies.  Even using 'Twitter' for one of Sevastopol’s unlucky residents 'Mike Tanaka'.  These stories all add value to the experience as you may decide, like me, to find out everything you can about, 'that dead female body in Seegson Synthetics' adding hours to your playtime.  The one drawback to the story is the ending which is left as a 'Cliff-hanger' which I personally don't like with games.\n\nThe only problem I could perceive people having with this game is the backtracking.  As you progress through the story you'll unlock upgrades to your tools that will allow you to access previously locked areas.  Even quests towards the end have you backtracking through earlier areas in order to reach a new area, however I personally enjoyed this as these areas were always vastly different in the way of gameplay challenges.  For instance, earlier on, a specific area might not have had the Alien present whereas when you return to this area it is, or there’s a new route in the area you can take because you have the 'ION Torch' now.\n\nIn summary, Alien: Isolation is a fantastic game that truly delivers the horror survival experience to the Alien franchise.  The games developer Creative Assembly, have clearly gone to extraordinary lengths to innovate worn out mechanics, craft beautiful authentic environments, and bring to life a host of characters that delivers a meaningful, memorable and truly horrifying experience.  This game is worth every penny.\n","January 4","true","77.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is frustrating, unforgiving and dull at the same time.\n\nIt succeeds at establishing and maintaining a tense sci-fi horror atmosphere, which is no small feat. I believe this is what the game tries to accomplish first and foremost, and it succeeds admirably. A solid 8/10.\n\nThe Good The narrative. The story is on par with the first two alien movies. Very recognizable. Similar pace, similar narrative devices, similar twists. To some, it may be too similar to be exciting in any way, because hardly anything happens that you did not see coming. Still. Some things you expect to happen may be a while in coming, and others happen surprisingly early.\nSome environments are modeled very closely after the movie sets. Great atmosphere there. Great sense of purpose to these sections.\nThe Alien has a proper AI, as opposed to being entirely pre-scripted in its behaviour. Keeps players on their toes.\nAmanda is an engineer, and she can put together helpful makeshift devices from scrap and raw material to help you survive.\nThe alien animations are pretty well done. Especially when it gets you. And it will.\nThe sound design is fantastic. Big plus in a stealth title.\nThe Bad Many environments are too generic a sci-fi tunnel, corridor, hall, or room with too many fake, forced accessories like boxes and barrels around. Doom 3 and Dead Space-like interior design. These sections feel generic, there's no believable in-game purpose to them. To the extent that they support the function of a location (med/tech junction/energy etc.), they are often merely servicable. There are exceptions, but all in all, once you finish the game, you'll remember only a select few locations for what they were.\nThe alien AI is frustrating, and not very convincing. You may like it for its unpredicatbility. To me it feels quite predictable in the sense that you can't to jack-all once the alien is out and looking for you. You need to wait for it to disappear in the vents for it to be somewhat safe to do anything. On easier diffictulties you might get away with some stunts, but not in general. Not if you don't know your surroundings yet.\n\nThe AI leash is maybe a little too tightly centered around the player, and it definitely is tugging the alien too often in the player's direction. The alien leaving a room, then promptly turning around, searching again. Then again. Then maybe running off in a different direction for 5 secs before the AI tugs it back. The alien sections are tense for that reason, yes, but when you're playing a section for the first time, not knowing your way around you're going to die a lot or wait a lot or both.\n\nThe alien has a proper AI that leads to emergent situations as opposed to the occasional prescribed scripted event. It makes it more likely for the game to just decide that you must die now. X-Com style. Like when there's a very small tight-quarters section that you have to cross, and the game decides to basically drop the alien out of a vent and almost into your lap. Here's your reload button. Luck is definitely a bigger factor than in other stealth based games, especially when you try to conserve your resources. Sucks if the last save is 5 minutes of tedious sneaking around hostile androids away.\n\nThe use of craftable items is mostly not incentivised. Using your little helper devices should be more core to a stealth game. As it is, these things are mostly obscure. Maybe it's just me, but the game is unforgiving when you slip up. Here's your 5-10 minute section with unskippable dialog that you must replay if you slip up. Why on earth would you prefer to stage "distractions" which are basically "attractions" for anything around, if there seems to be a valid way to just sneak by. What good is a "smoke bomb" or "pipe bomb" except to shout "over here, here I am"? Does not feel like the AI should be dumb enough to fall for it in the way it does. So it hardly ever feels like using your gadgets would be really helpful. Even though it is pretty effective if you try. It's just not really plausible behaviour that it triggers. Maybe the overall sense of dread and horror the game establishes so successfully is at odds with the dumb effects your gadgets trigger when used.\n\nMaybe if there was a way to quicksave, the player would be more inclined to experiment with the effects of gadgets, but if the game is penalizing eperimentation, you'd probably rather wait for an opportunity and sneak by, unless you saw no other way.\n\nThrow a noisemaker somewhere. A crew of looters is going to run over there to look at the thing. The alien too. They might just ignore each other while the funny noise takes their interest. Then, once they want to 'disperse' again, they may jump on each other's throats. Or not. I've had an alien just run straight back into the vents from a situation like this.\n\nThe snaking mechanics with regards to human opponents is awful. If you're used to Thief, Spliter Cell, or Styx-like mechanics you're going to have to adjust. Human opponents are somewhat odd in their perception. Light and shadow, distance, noise, and everybody is short-sighted used to be a thing. Now it's almost exclusively line of sight, but that line is somewhat hard to trace. You'll need to get used to it the way you needed to get used to die at Dark Souls before you embraced the mechanics :)\nAll in all a solid experience, and the weak or frustrating bits are just a minor annoyance in comparison with the experience as a whole.\n\nHope to see Amanda in a Sequel again. Preferably in more memorable environments, and with more plausible AI behaviour.","November 22, 2015","true","27.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The story got me hooked it was surprising and understandable. I still don't know how to explain it but when I played this game with the lights off I was instantly drawn into the game as it became a new reality. The graphics and lighting where to perfection and with the mood set by the story and soundtrack it was very atmospheric. The gameplay was great with parts being casual puzzle solvers and when needed high intense situations. The only negative thing I people mentioned was it was too confusing, at parts it was but a simple solution was to just pay attention to general areas and objectives, after all you are and a giant space ship.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildt/recommended/214490/","wildt","Wildt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wildt/","172 products in account","Stealthy horror survival games aren't normally high on my list of prefered genres, so I bought the game solely to try the unofficial experimental VR support.\n\nAfter having spent 17+ hours completing the campaign, I must say that it has been the most intense, stressful gaming experience I've ever endured.\n\nIntense because the Alien universe from the original 1979 movie is so incredibly faithfully recreated, that experiencing it in VR immersed me like no other game ever has before. BRAVO to the developers, it's a work of art.\n\nStressful for two reasons:\n\nThe primary reason being that an unkillable predator is hunting you down most of the game, even when you're performing tasks that'd normally "pause" in-game time, like e.g. using a computer or inserting your keycard in a "save game" terminal. In VR you're literally looking over your shoulder hoping noone or nothing will ambush you.\nSadly I found the Alien's behaviour to be so absolutely unpredictable at times, that it simply ruined some stages of the game for me. The first few times it killed me during a specific part of the map, it got the adrenaline going, and I felt psycked to retry it. But after having replayed the same savegame 20 times, still feeling that it was an absolute coin toss when that oversized slimy rat would drop from a vent shaft right behind me, my enthusiasm also died.\n\nDespite this, I did mostly have an absolute thrill ride scavenging, crafting, hiding and sometimes killing my way through the game. Firing that bolt gun into the face of one of those "super" synthetics has to be one of the most satisfying things ever.\n\nThe second contributor to the stress factor is that the VR support is so lackluster:\n\n- The horizon drifts, and you have to reset it every 5-10 minutes or suffer nausea (your milage may vary)\n\n- There is no IPD adjustment, and the default is WAY off, so reading the computer terminals is like reading something 5 cm in front of your nose.\n\n- The "fade to black" mechanism that is supposed to prevent you from leaning into geometry is faulty, and makes it extremely diffult to see certain terminal screens later in the game (the ones at the core)\n\n- Many HUD elements are difficult/impossible to read\n\n- Some graphical effects are defect, but most can be disabled\n\nAll these technical VR related flaws, makes it hard for me to recommend playing the VR mode in it's current state to people new to VR. Especially with rumors of official VR support in the pipeline. But if you've grown your VR legs, and think you can tolerate said bugs/flaws, then this is an absolute must play. It's just an amazing VR experience.\n\nRegardless of VR, fans of the genre and/or franchise owe it to themselves to experience this.","March 14","true","21.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

It did what a good horror game should do and scared me.  It did what a good film license should do and was faithfull to the license, while extending the licensed universe in a way that was consitant with it and good for gameplay.\n\nOn one occasion the game uses a flashback to let you take part in events in the Alien universe that they could not shoe horn into the main plot, which is inconsistant with the rest of the game, but had this Alien fanboy squeeling with delight.\n\nThe levels, interfaces, ambience were spot on recreations of the set and props from the Alien movie.  I could not be more pleased in this regard.  The graphical and acustic fidelity are amazing, attention to detail right down to animating the coulds of the gas giant that is hanging outside the window.  Isolation has some scary and beautifull set peices.\n\nI am one of those players that likes the whole "use both mouse button then press down" to pull a big lever that requires boith hands.  This kind of mechanic is used effectively several times throughout the game,\n\nOn the down-side, I never found a use for 80% of the stuff you can craft, so I was collecting and building but rarely using.    The whole crafting and inventory system felt rather awkward and clunky, which I blame on cross platform controls.   The game has some incosistancies when interacting with tech, some levers you use with "E" and some you "RMB + Down" and these levers look just the same.\n\nNot sure that I like the fixed save points, but I guess they really are for the best or I would have been spamming the quick save key every six feet.\n\nThe final gameplay is a series of previously un-used quick time events, this is the worst way to end a game.  In terms of story telling the ending felt a little off, neither a proper crecendo nor a fade out.  Not sure if I would replay it, but I would recommand it to fans of sci-fi horror.","February 1, 2015","true","22.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you don't like a challenge and/or hate the Alien series, MOVE ON NOOB!!!\nHowever, I will recommend this game to almost anyone. If you like the Alien series, you are in for a REAL treat! I will not spoil what you will find in the game, but I will say that the Alien is increadibly smart!!!! It will learn your movements, it does not run on a set path, and it WILL FIND YOU!!!! Your adrenaline will be running so hard that when you go to enter the code into a door, you will quite often enter it wrong because of pure fear. That's just how very well this game is made! The graphics & effects are BEAUTIFUL!!! Even on lower graphics cards, you will not be disappointed. It's very well refined and even follows the Alien move deleted scenes that I had long forgotten. So worth the time and SO worth the money. NO REGRETS HERE!!!!! Curious? Try it and see for yourself!

Everything in Alien: Isolation looks like it was ripped directly out of the movie. All of the aesthetics-- the visuals, the sound, the music, all spot on. The computers especially. CA totally nailed it.\n\nThe game itself is great, but not perfect. Like most stealth games, the AI is lacking at times, but that is to be expected. Mechanically, it is all very sound. The controls, weapons, actions, animations, etc are all very consistent and work well. The crafting system seems a bit unnecessary, but doesn't take away from the game. I expereinced very few bugs the entire game. Maybe two minor graphical errors.\n\nThe campaign is pretty lengthy (~15 hours for me), and the survival mode offers quite a bit more replay value. I picked up the season pass too, but haven't played any of that content yet. It assuredly adds even more to do.\n\nAnyway, if you're into Alien at all, or sci-fi stealth/survival games, you should definitely give this a go.","April 25, 2015","true","15.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

But even though A:I left a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth at the end, I would recomment it, because it just gets so many things right.\nFirst of all, designs. This game in terms of aethetics is a period piece of an era that never existed. The 1970s and 80s' version of the the future was recreated with such immense detail that it makes for one of the most cohehise and convincing sci-fi worlds in a game that I have ever seen. Visually this game had me hooked from start to finish, as even at later stages I took my time to just look around the enviromnents to appriaciate the great effort that went into making it so authentic. Interestingly, this design language also translated to the look of UI, which has its retro-touches here and there like VHS-like artefacts and filmgrain. The radial menu plays into that aethetic, but it does so sadly at a cost of being a little unintuitive.  It was great to look at, but not so great to use.\nStealth mechanics were very well designed: sound effects provided very organic feedback, level design and crafting system worked hand in hand with keeping the player on the edge with just enough recources for distraction and  repulsion as well as enviromental advantages to get from point A to B. It takes a skillful approach and good use of all of the mechanics to avoid being horribly murdered over and over again.\nThe problem is that this game is long. Far too long for a horror game to work. I had so much time to get aquianted with the Alien's AI and strategies of survival that by the time I was about to finish this game, Alien has become more of an annoyence than a source of horror. Early encounters with the Alien counted among the scariest experiences I've had in a game, the later ones were unfortunetely completely devoid of tension; the effect was further emphesised by the introduction of a flamethrower, which basically made the Alien feel like a noisy little dog that you have to occasionally shoo away in order to move on. (NOTE: I don't mean to say that I use flamethrowers to shoo away dogs IRL)\nIt doesn't help that almost all of the objectives troughout the whole 12-20 hours long campaign revolve around tuning stuff on. Turn on the generator here, open doors here, go back to that place to get a key to other doors, turn on other generator to open these doors and so on and so forth. The constant tinkering and engineering was justified by the occupation of the protagonist but it didn't make it any lesss dull to me. Aside from that, the story seemed like it was poorly tacked on on top of ready-made setpieces. Amanda didn't seem like a fleshed out character in any shape or form, and the other character I couldn't care less about either. The half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at a plot twist in the last act was so poorly executed that it was kind of impressive.\nI might sound like I hate this game, but all the bad stuff can be almost exclusively attributed to length, especially last few hours, so while I thought the ending was terrible, the first  3/4 of the game provide with a good enough experience to recommend it, especially if it's on sale.\n+ perfectly captures the mood of the first movie\n+ cool-as-balls retrofuturistic designs\n+ great level design\n+ Alien encounters are genuinely scary\n+ gorgeous UI\n- not necesesarily practical UI (radial and crafting menus are a little wonky)\n- the story felt tacked on on top of already made up setpieces\n- repetetive objectives\n- TOO LONG","June 21, 2015","true","21.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Where do I even start? This game is hands-down a wonderful experience. The pros are great but the cons are plentiful, so I suppose I'll just hop right in.\n\nPros:\n-This game is horrifying right off the bat.\n-This game pays a lot of homage to the original movies (e.g. the futuristic 80's experience)\n-The setting is very movie-accurate\n-Lots of in-game mechanics are very unique and I've never seen before.\n-Lighting was gorgeous\n-The music/sounds are wonderful and really enhance gameplay\n-This game made me shriek multiple times\n-You're always terrified of the Alien\n\nCons:\n-This game is based in two parts: before flamethrower and after flamethrower\n-You're only terrified of the Alien until you get the flamethrower to make it go back from whence it came, quickly turning this game from a survival horror to an FPS\n-(at least for me) the lip sync was terrible in cutscenes.\n-Too many times the game pulls the classic "You're safe now- OH WAIT! No you're not!"\n-The Alien turns from being the main antagonist to just a general nuisance half way through the game\n-Most of the characters I didn't care about at all\n-Plot points were very predictable\n-Ending was very, very weak.\n-Ripley never asked the all-important question: "Why the hell am I doing everything alone??"\n\nIt does seem that the cons outweigh the pros by a land slide, but after it's all said and done, I'm very happy that I played this game. I did enjoy playing it, I highly recommend it, but I don't think it was worth all the hype. My advice is to wait for this game to go on sale, it was most definitely worth the $12.50 I paid, but I can't imagine it's worth $50.","July 13, 2015","true","21.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The fact that the alien always knows your general location doesnt help, that works in the main game, but not in this mode.\n\nI finished the game with a great aftertaste, absolutely loved it, and yet, when I got to play the survivor mode, I barely completed 2 maps before uninstalling, it really is not fun and the game should have just stayed as a story driven one.\n\nThe other two DLC, last survivor and crew expendable are OK, though they are very short, so get them on a cheap sale, but DON'T get the season pass.","July 15, 2015","true","22.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It did what a good horror game should do and scared me.  It did what a good film license should do and was faithfull to the license, while extending the licensed universe in a way that was consitant with it and good for gameplay.\n\nOn one occasion the game uses a flashback to let you take part in events in the Alien universe that they could not shoe horn into the main plot, which is inconsistant with the rest of the game, but had this Alien fanboy squeeling with delight.\n\nThe levels, interfaces, ambience were spot on recreations of the set and props from the Alien movie.  I could not be more pleased in this regard.  The graphical and acustic fidelity are amazing, attention to detail right down to animating the coulds of the gas giant that is hanging outside the window.  Isolation has some scary and beautifull set peices.\n\nI am one of those players that likes the whole "use both mouse button then press down" to pull a big lever that requires boith hands.  This kind of mechanic is used effectively several times throughout the game,\n\nOn the down-side, I never found a use for 80% of the stuff you can craft, so I was collecting and building but rarely using.    The whole crafting and inventory system felt rather awkward and clunky, which I blame on cross platform controls.   The game has some incosistancies when interacting with tech, some levers you use with "E" and some you "RMB + Down" and these levers look just the same.\n\nNot sure that I like the fixed save points, but I guess they really are for the best or I would have been spamming the quick save key every six feet.\n\nThe final gameplay is a series of previously un-used quick time events, this is the worst way to end a game.  In terms of story telling the ending felt a little off, neither a proper crecendo nor a fade out.  Not sure if I would replay it, but I would recommand it to fans of sci-fi horror.","February 1, 2015","true","22.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So, what to expect in this game is some HARDCORE stealth and fast thinking! If you don't like a challenge and/or hate the Alien series, MOVE ON NOOB!!!\nHowever, I will recommend this game to almost anyone. If you like the Alien series, you are in for a REAL treat! I will not spoil what you will find in the game, but I will say that the Alien is increadibly smart!!!! It will learn your movements, it does not run on a set path, and it WILL FIND YOU!!!! Your adrenaline will be running so hard that when you go to enter the code into a door, you will quite often enter it wrong because of pure fear. That's just how very well this game is made! The graphics & effects are BEAUTIFUL!!! Even on lower graphics cards, you will not be disappointed. It's very well refined and even follows the Alien move deleted scenes that I had long forgotten. So worth the time and SO worth the money. NO REGRETS HERE!!!!! Curious? Try it and see for yourself!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/recommended/214490/","coaldust-numbers","Coaldust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/","235 products in account","If you like the first two movies of the Aliens series you will probably enjoy Alien: Isolation.  It's basically a good game, with a lot of flaws.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe plot is almost as good as the first two movies.\n\nThe graphics are great!  They look exactly like what you saw in the first two movies, only there is far more of it, and more variety.\n\nThe sound is also great!  The soundtrack, which seems to be wholly original, would be at home in the first two movies.  Many sound effects are taken from the first two movies, though new, fitting, ones are introduced.\n\nThe save points are reasonably distributed and implemented acceptably.\n\nAll the settings PC gamers expect are provided.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe reason the plot is almost as good as the first two movies is large swaths of it are copied from the first two movies.  This game could have benefited greatly from more creative writing.\n\nThe reason the plot is almost as good as the first two movies is it is too long and has too much filler.  When a movie in the Aliens series, or a video game, ends, it is usually on a note of success.  You never get that feeling of success in this game.  First you try Plan A, but that doesn't work…  Then you try Plan B, and that doesn't work either…  On and on until you run out of letters…  A good horror movie has at most 2 or 3 ‘plans’.  It's not that I wanted ‘less game’, it's that I want ‘more success per failure’.\n\nRemember Amanda Ripley is supposed to be an engineer.  She should be rather intelligent.  The plot is very much ‘on rails’, and forces you (her) to do some really stupid things.  When Ripley encounters a barricade she never seems to question why it is there, or what could go wrong if she removes it.  She never constructs barricades (or anything but consumables) herself.  If these situations were going to arise in the game, it should have been for optional loot, and occasionally have had bad outcomes.\n\nThe plot also makes the opposite error.  Apparently Amanda Ripley is a master of all fields of study!  The game will tell you to <lingo> the <lingo>, and Ripley immediately understands this.  The poor player gets a circle on the map (which may be quite large, and refer to any floor), where they are expected to bumble around for an hour or three while being repeatedly killed by aliens before they understand what they are expected to do.  To further aggravate this problem, many interactive items are not obviously interactive.  For example, the first time you encounter a rats nest of blue pipes you will probably ignore it as more setting-appropriate clutter, especially since it has no gadgetry attached and doesn't highlight when you look directly at it, but no, that's interactive!\n\nIf you are at all technically-minded, you may be bothered by the fact that a lot of the setting makes no sense:\nThere is contrived ductwork everywhere.  Clearly in the future there are laws to assure space ships and space stations are accessible to alien parasites.  In Mission 12: Synthetic Solution, in the android dealer's back office, a room with a high ceiling, there is an undamaged duct that runs from the center of the ceiling to about six feet off the floor, specially engineered for alien convenience.\nThe law does not discriminate against Peeping Toms in the future.  There are easy to see through gratings placed on ductwork for your convenience.  They only appear in rooms where plot exposition occurs, like the one you observe Samuels through in Mission 12: Synthetic Solution.\nThere are doors everywhere with covers that have to be removed with a cutting torch.  So the engineers were smart enough to recognize that someone might need to be able to unlock the door from the other side, but they were not smart enough to think of more reasonable ways to allow that, like master keycards.\nAlien: Isolation observes the tradition of including hacking minigames no one enjoys, but everyone feels obligated to include in their games.  As usual, the hacking minigames do not remotely resemble real hacking, and aren't even intellectually demanding.  They only require you react quickly enough.  On the bright side, they are easy and short, so you can quickly get back to more enjoyable parts of the game.\nIn Mission 16: Transmission, there is a computer displaying satellite coordinates against the left side of a device for inputting satellite coordinates.  Apparently in the future interstellar space flight is possible, but automating the entry of satellite coordinates is too complex.\nIn Mission 18: Tomorrow, Together, there are transit cars flying along rails that are broken every few feet, through tunnels that have collapsed.\nThe ending is terrible.  It is both short and unsatisfying.\n\nThe designers went for cheap hits and jump scares, instead of the slower-building atmospheric horror of the movies on which this game is based.  The game is worse for that.  Playing it involves a lot of trial and error.\n\nThe aliens are too omnipresent.  They quickly change from being scary to annoying.  They frequently rapidly cycle through their patrol route, and the difficulty isn't in figuring out how to sneak past them, but doing it in the narrow time window you are given.  They also linger in the area they think you are in for ages, so you spend lots of time rolling your eyes and sighing in some locker, waiting for them to move on so you can make some progress.\n\nThe alien AI is too limited and mechanical.  This might have gone unnoticed if it were not a constant pest.  Soon the player learns that the alien is always in their local area, and will cycle through its patrol route unless it sees or hears them or a distraction.  When it sees or hears them or a distraction it will linger in that area until it sees or hears something else of interest, gets bored and returns to its patrol route, or finds the player.  It will only ever pass through ceiling vents unless it can see the player through a wall or floor vent opening.  Its attack always consists of running straight at the player, even if there is a lit flamethrower pointed at it.  At that point any feeling of being hunted is lost.  They should have made the aliens behave more organically, but kept it fair by having them telegraph their actions, making it possible to escape them after you have been spotted, and giving the player vantage points to observe them.\n\nApparently the designers think that if a decaying space station was infested with lethal alien parasites, 99% of the populace would turn into sociopathic idiots.  They will start shooting at you on sight while screaming, “It didn't have to be this way!”.  The game provides no way to interact with them.  You aren't allowed to say, “I've got no interest in your food or equipment, and gunfire will just attract the creature, so can I please just pass by you to use that elevator?”  Instead you either have to kill them yourself and attract the alien, or use a noisemaker to attract the alien to have it kill them for you.  In other words, you have to act like a sociopathic idiot.\n\nThe cleanroom suits some androids wear should not grant them the ridiculous protection it does.  It makes sense that it stops the stun baton, but it shouldn't do anything to protect them from a pipe bomb going off directly under their feet, or similar catastrophic damage.\n\nIt would have been more believable if adult aliens could be killed.  It should be difficult, and ammunition should remain limited.\n\nThere are many annoying quick time events in this game.  There is usually no time pressure, no decision to make, and no way to mess them up.  It just made the cinema scenes have awkward pauses and clutter over them, and felt like busywork.","November 14, 2015","true","43.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Převážně se odehrává na stanici Sevastopol kde se vše jaksi zkazí a musíte se dostat pryč. K tomu všemu vás nahání vetřelec. O tom to je v kostce, teď tedy k názorům...\n\nHra je naprosto úžásná. Už po prvním setkání s vetřelcem jsem věděl že toto bude dramatická zkušenost která vejde do mého top listu her. Příběh vás vtáhne, postavy jsou zajímavé a hlavně, atmosféra, ta je naprosto úžásná. Je dechberoucí jak strašně moc připomíná filmy a jak děsně vývojáři dokázali převzít svět filmů Vetřelec do hry. Už jen ta grafika a prostředí z toho dělá něco na co jen tak nezapomenete.\n\n//Příběh\nJak jsem říkal v intru. Příběh se točí kolem stanice Sevastopol na kterou vy, tedy Ripley, se svojí skupinou přistanete, ale zjišťujete že nic není normální a Sevastopol je celý nefunkční a později i odhalíte děsivou pravdu, že za vše může tajemné stvoření z vesmíru. V podstatě celou hru se budete pohybovat na Sevastopolu a ve vyjímečných chvilkách na jiných lodích ale také budete i ve vesmíru na spravovatelských cestách když bych to tak řekl.Příběh vás dokáže vtáhnout a má zajímavé charaktery. Některé pasáže jsou velmi nezapomenutelné, budu se avšak vyhýbat spoilerům takže to by bylo k příběhu vše.\n\n//Grafika\nTam není co dodávat. Je perfektní, bez chyby. Atmosféra je jak vystřihnutá z filmu, efekty a světla jsou úžasný a celkové zpracování má ten vetřelecký nádech.\n\n//Ovládání\nOvládání mi přišlo na survival horror docela unikátní. Nebylo úplně klasické, neřekl bych že to byla novinka, ale mírně to v pár aspektech odbočilo od konkurentů. (Např. Naklánění funguje pomocí C a pohybových kláves. Mezerníkem neskáčete, místo toho vytasíte Motion tracker a pár další maličkostí.)\nCelkově se ale dalo dobře zvyknout a ovládat, vše fungovalo jak má a bylo to pohodlné.\n\n//Optimalizace\nOptimalizaci jsem vždy chápal jako důležitou část hry, protože když vyrobíte skvělou hru, ale špatně je optimalizujete tak že jí nikdo nespustí, je to škoda. Naštěstí to není případ AI. AI jelo dobře, nesekalo se a vše fungovalo tak jak má!\n\n//Dodatky\nHra slibovala nepředvídatelného vetřelce, no, dočinila slibu. Občas vám vetřelec připadá naprosto hloupý a vy se mu smějete jak si vás nevšiml ikdyž jste těsně vedle a někdy zas jste tři metry daleko a on si k vám doběhne a propíchne vás. To se mi velmi líbí protože to dodává hře ten pocit že jste neustále v nebezpečí a pravý přeživší, se krčí celou hru. Vetřelec je poměrně citlivý na zvuk, takže začnete sprintovat a pokud je poblíž už jste víceméně mrtvý.\n\nCrafting system je jednoduchej a zábavnej. Můžete si vyrábět udělátka jako flashbangy, noisemakery a takové ty pomůcky k přežití. Naštěstí nemůžete kraftit náboje, to by bylo příliš op. Suroviny jsou po celém Sevastopolu takže prozkomávání se vám jistě vyplatí!\n\n~~~~~\nTo bude asi zatím vše co mám v hlavě. Tato hra je 100% nejlepší Alien hra která kdy byla doposud vyrobená. Podle mě předčila AvP (2010) i AvP Classic a Colonial Marines...o tom se asi nemusíme bavit.\n\n10/10  - Jedna z TOP Survival horror her které kdy byly vyrobeny.","November 19, 2015","true","11.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jippalippa/recommended/214490/","jippalippa","jippalippa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jippalippa/","314 products in account","One of the best games i have ever played. Period.\nAnd i'm not even a huge fan of "Survival Horror" games.\nAlien Isolation achieves something no game or film, released from the 1980s, could manage to; it accurately captures the feeling and atmosphere of the original movie from 1979.\nAlien Isolation is perfect in every way, so unlike my other reviews i'll be more schematic with this one:\n\nAtmosphere and overall Feeling:\nThe game has an insanely chilling and fashinating setting, the "abandoned" Sevastopol space station. The whole game is really creepy and the amazing 1970s science fiction look is genuenly replicated; a magical age in which people travelled in space but still used CRT computer screens and big floppy discs.\nAn other thing that makes the sevastopol great is its variety; while the game keeps the same style thoughout the adventure, the station offers a nice variety of areas and locations.\n\nGameplay:\nAlien Isolation is one of the few survival horror games which really is all about survival. You are almost completely defenseless and chased by a terrifying xenomorph, which has the upper edge in every situation. The map offers very few supplies and ammo, so you'll mostly need to sneak around, trying to remain undetected, crafting items and improvising when the alien is dangerously close.\n\nRythm:\nThe rythm is perfect!\nThe game wisely alternates high tension moments with long "relaxed" sessions.\nThe Alien is always close to you, and can surprise you whenever he wants to, but sometimes he doesn't show up for a very long time, therefore leaving you with a constant sense of fear which is very stimulating.\n\nGraphics:\nGraphics are great! Ok...we are not dealing with Cry Engine 3 here, but every part of the station is very well made and the lighting enine can sometimes produce "screenshot-worthy" moments.\nEverything helps the player to really feel inside the sevastopol.\n\nDifficulty:\nI highly recommend playing the game at "Hard", because the game is actually very well balanced. The alien is smart, fast and knows its surrounding, but it still can be avoided by using intelligence and strategy; basically it's not impossible to progress...it just requires patience and planning.\nStill, what makes the creature believable, is its "Random factor". The creature might decide to abruptly change direction, to turn 180° or to come back visiting a location he has been in only a few moments earlier, so the player will also need to take a couple of chances and improvise from time to time.\nFor example if you hide in a locker the Alien might choose to just walk buy or to check the lockers...and many other situations like that. You are never a 100% safe.\n\nFear and Terror factor:\nThe game is great because it's genuinely terrifying, but at least it gives you the tools to progress.\nThe alien is strong, fast and impossible to kill, but you still have some ways to know its position (very roughly), so you don't feel a 100% impotent like in games such as "Amnesia The Dark Descent".\n\nIn the end Alien Isolation is my personal GOTY 2014!\nA game highly recommended not only for Alien fans (which will droll at every frame) but also for players searching fo a very well done product overall.\n\nPros:\n- Incredible atmosphere\n- Great graphics\n- Great map design\n- Really scary, but not "impossible to progress" type of scary\n- Complex stealth gameplay\n- Perfect rythm (between calmer and intense sections)\n- Very good sountrack\n- Challenging but rewarding\n- Perfect gameplay\n- Very cool locations\n- Very loyal to the source material\n- Long game! You get more than your money's worth\n\nCons:\n- Gets less terrifyng (and easier) after you get the flamethrower\n\nTo Keep in Mind:\n- It offers the best experience if played at "Hard" (don't worry...it will be hard indeed, but not impossible)","March 5, 2015","true","21.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

I'm a huge Alien Universe fan, and I felt this game is probably the best one made for that universe.  There were some nit-picks I would have with it including unrealistic human interations (why does everyone want to kill me?) and some bits of the story are a little far fetch, plus I found the ending to be slightly predictable.\n\nThat said, the visuals are amazing, the alien is random and incredibly deadly, the game offers a solid challenge (hard mode), and it's the closest I think any of us will get to being in the alien universe.  The controls are solid, the sounds are amazing and terrifying, and the music engine plays all the right pieces at all the right times - adding significantly to the dark, isolated atmosphere.  The weapons add just the right balance of play without making you feel unstoppable.  The minute-to-minute decisions you choose yield consequences that matter for survival.  A great amount of detail went into the alien, as well.  Though some design and sound decisions for the alien I felt were'nt quite right, the creature as a whole is daunting and terrifying. It also has hidden Oculus Rift DK2 support that can be enabled from the configuration file which adds even more immersion to the universe if you have a Rift.\n\nThis is probably the strongest game in the sci-fi survival horror genre, and it's worth picking up if you are into that kind of thing (which I am!).  I've never been so happy to be hunted by the scariest creature in the universe!\n\nP.S. - This is locker hiding simulator 2014 for gamers who are easily scared :)","December 13, 2014","true","55.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

But even combined they're nothing when compared to late Swiss artist H.R. Giger's most popular creation: the Alien. Ever since it was seen for the first time back in 1979, success followed on many fronts for a while. But unfortunately, nothing lasts forever. Rebellion (the very team that created two legendary AvP games back in 90's) tried to give us just as tasteful experience in 2010, but the time seemed to have passed the British team.\n\nStill that wasn't even half bad compared to Aliens: Colonial Marines, the game that still gives me (and surely many other Alien -fans) a painful headache. Almost everything from the very core of the game was just messed up and instead of feeling fear, I just felt a shared sense of shame due to wasted potential. But when every last bit of Marine's equipment - even the iconic pulse rifle - is taken from you, what's going to happen then?\n\nCreative Assembly's - British dev team known from Total War series - Alien: Isolation is anything but the same we've seen so many times: instead of being marine equipped with heavy firepower, you're pitted as a civilian, who lacks combat experience and who can be killed at any time. Literally. In Isolation you fight against your threats (mostly) by good thinking, not by guns. And that's just the beginning.\n\nIsolation takes place 15 years after the events of Alien; commercial starship USCSS Nostromo has disappeared and so has  the game's protagonist's (Amanda Ripley) mother, Ellen Ripley. One day a man named Samuels comes to tell her that Sevastopol Station has acquired Nostromo's flight recorder and it doesn't take too much from him to convince Amanda to join retrieval team. Unfortunately things aboard Sevastopol Station aren't going well: humans turn on each other and shoot each other due to paranoia, mannequinlike Working Joe -androids have lost it and they attack humans at sight and last but not least there's an unstoppable, merciless alien roaming around the station.\n\nSevastopol Station is plainly put gorgeous and Creative Assembly has put the source material to a good use. Everywhere  you see something that reminds you of that time when the future wasn't so high-tech like it is shown in modern sci-fi series. Just add into this an atmospheric soundtrack, that has taken some notes from Jerry Goldsmith's composition and you're at home, especially if you're a die-hard Alien fan. But moving around Sevastopol isn't just exploring, because at the moment you either hear thumping or hissing nearby, you really wish that you knew the environment well enough to escape from the clutches of your enemies.\n\nThe mission pattern however is quite simple: most of the time you pull levers, hack the doors with your hacking tool and search for the component X to make it to the next level. But it's all about that nightmarish hide-and-seek -game between life and death that either encourages or discourages you to play the game through. Word of warning: Isolation is not a fun game, but I still like it very much. Why? Because it actually forces you to think even insignificant things through and through. Even the use of a safe system needs to be timed carefully, because when you're saving your progress, you're leaving yourself open to attack. Thus the fear of death is constantly present, especially in the first half of the game.\n\nYou're not completely helpless against the enemies, because with a motion tracker you can see their nearby location. As you progress, you'll find blueprints for different kinds of tools, such as EMP mines, noisemakers, smoke bombs etc. Every tool has its strengths and weaknesses, but you shouldn't rely on them too much, if you want to conserve your resources for real nasty situations. Firearms should be forbidden from use most of the time, because the sound of firing attracts unwanted attention and really, that's the last thing you want to do in this game. You can take down both humans and androids with guns, but stopping the alien itself requires either flamethrower, Molotov or pipe bomb, and even then it disappears only for a while.\n\nAlien: Isolation, however, isn't a perfect game. In addition to monotonic mission pattern environments are recycled, especially on the last third of the game. And even though it took me almost 20 hours to complete the game, it would have actually taken 12(!) hours, showing that seemingly little mistakes have a huge impact on the game's events. To be honest, most of the time the fault was mine, because I either let my guard down or didn't pay enough attention to the environment. When I played this game second time on Nightmare -difficulty, only then I felt that some deaths were unfair, like when the alien jumped on me straight out of the vent without a single warning sign.\n\nThe game also has a Survivor mode, where you simply try to reach your destination, either as fast as possible or trying to get a good score by completing side objectives during the run. Alien and other enemies, of course, try to put a stop to your plans and you need to either outsmart or get rid of them faster than in the main game, provided you have enough resources to deal with them. Even though I find this mode interesting, with the main game there's only just ONE map and you're not probably going to spend much time with it, unless... you'll buy the DLC (*sigh*).\n\nAnyways, I can say that Alien has finally got the game it truly deserves. The one that respects its source material and it keeps thrill-seeking players in its tight, even sadistic grip all the way through to the credits. Look out, necromorphs and other monsters from outer space, Daddy's come home!\n\n\nPROS:\n+ Late 70's sci-fi\n+ Alien scares once again\n+ Great environments...\n+ Superb visuals and fantastic soundscape\n+ Appropriately challenging\n\nCONS:\n- Mission pattern could have been more diverse\n(- May frustrate you at times)\n- ... that end up victims of recycling at the last third of the game\n- Survivor mode (without the DLC packs) feels an empty addition\n\n\nGRAPHICS:              9\nSOUND:                  10\nGAMEPLAY:            8\nLASTING APPEAL:  8\n\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 9","February 14, 2015","true","98.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/recommended/214490/","mcdux0r","dux0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcdux0r/","1067 products in account","A slow paced progression horror survival game in the eerie and isolated Sevastepol space station. Alien: Isolation seems to be quite overrated because of the convincingly amazing graphics and the subject matter, but I feel like many of its flaws are being forgiven and ignored which doesn't do the developers and the players justice, and the genre indirectly suffers as a whole. It's important to note that there are people who just wont like this title.\n\nOverall though, Alien: Isolation is worth experiencing for anyone who wants to explore the incredibly detailed space station, and while the story matter isn't going to satisfy the hardcore movie fans, it's fairly well done and treats James Carmons' works with respect. Anyone looking for a convincing atmosphere and genuinely scary gameplay from a horror game is also going to want to dive right in.\n\nIf you belong to neither group, then reviewing the pros and cons should help you decide whether this should go at the top or bottom of your priorities list. Either way it's worth a committed play through for most gamers.\n\nHighlights\nThe setting for this game is absolutely great and the 80s product design, and detail on some of the rooms and appliances is incredible, especially early on. The mechanics and feel of the controls, when combined with the wonderful U.I. layers and concepts all add to the immersion and survival experience. The graphics and lighting too, have clearly had a lot of love and attention. It's also technically very sound, and despite a few object rendering glitches, the game as a whole feels very sturdy and reliable.\n\n* Lighting is especially atmospheric and even beautiful in this game. At key moments in the main story you'll slowly become subtly more anxious through a combination of lighting, sound and design, only to have something startling occur, highlighted or hidden in the right way by the positioning of light in the room\n\nMistakes\nThe problems from this title all stem from the manner in which gameplay has been designed to fit into the world rather than the other way around. The developers have clearly either started with an amazing and detailed Sevastopol, or had an unrelenting focus on it throughout design, which has benefited the game by creating very real feeling exploration and\ndiscovery while working through the game, but has also detracted from the gameplay in small ways.\n\nGameplay is often quite predictable after a point, and you know what's going to happen next based on simply the room design or text logs and the game pulls the old movie cliche of "You've reached this point, now you're safe.. No you're NOT!" which wears thin. The plot too, feels way too predictable at times and the story as a whole suffers, especially from a bad ending. It's a real shame, and feels like a let down when compared against the immense work and attention that's went into keeping the world so true to the movies. That said, it's a horror game and for the genre the story is probably above average, I just expect a little more given the production value.\n\nThere's also the mid to late section of the game, which has been criticized relentlessly for good reason, where you're given a means of circumvention against the Alien. It helps progress the game and turn it in a faster, lighter direction, but also basically makes large parts of the game, and choices, obsolete and makes for a poorer experience overall.\n\n* The unpredictable nature of the AI helps add to the realistic feel at times, but also undermines gameplay by making some glaring mistakes like discovering you instantly or searching for you then leaving the entire section free for you to walk through safely. It can feel like you're exploiting AI weakness and may remove from the immersion.\n\n* The mechanics, while owing to serve to the horror and survival gameplay work on the whole, but often feel very annoying and repetitive when you've held W and X then Y and Z to open a lock for the 50th time\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at £31.99/49.99€/$49.99, Alien: Isolation is priced at around the same point as most triple A titles and very high in terms of its other survival horror competitors. Whether you feel that price point is justified or not is up to you, and play time is very high, clocking in at around 18-20 hours for the main story. Personally I can't justify spending that much on almost any game, but considering the amount of work put into this, I wouldn't have felt ripped off. It does go up to -75% off though, which brings it to a very fair price.\n\nThe Season Pass is another £19.99/29.99€/$29.99 and is frankly an outright ripoff. Which is a shame because there are some good DLCs for the right people. All of the DLCs are incredibly short, and maps can often be completed in less than 10 minutes, they're also usually more difficult than the main story, but are almost all very nice looking and short but fun. If you like Survival Mode, look at the 3 Survival Mode DLCs. If you like slower pace, look at the 2 Salvage Modes. If you loved the movie, consider the AC DLCs. Whatever the case, be aware of their utterly ridiculous high price when compared to play time. Buying one of the three is the best way to buy the DLC, and buy more if you liked that mode.\n\n* DLC 1. The Corporate Lockdown includes 3 maps under a time-based (ample time is given) Survival Mode and optional objectives help add more play time.\n* DLC 2. Trauma is very different but also includes another 3 maps in Survival Mode and includes new enemies.\n* DLC 3. Safe Haven includes one large map under the new Salvage Mode which has you venturing out to complete up to 10 objectives. Much harder than previous DLCs but with 2 hours instead of 30 minutes time limit.\n* DLC 4. Lost Contact is another Salvage Mode playing similar to Safe Haven. 10 more objectives and also very difficult.\n* DLC 5. The Trigger returns to the 3-map Survival Mode model and is the least liked of the three. Very quick and small maps.\n* AC (Additional Content) DLC 1. Crew Expendable is for movie fans looking to revisit and play as one of 3 crew on board the Nostromo. Gameplay is extremely short and can be completed in 30 seconds, but the setting is nicely done.\n* AC DLC 2. Last Survivor also revisits the Nostromo but as Ellen Ripley trying to escape after the deaths of Lambert and Parker. Also short (around 20 minutes), also difficult, also a nice setting.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/214490","July 19, 2015","true","9.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is undeniably one of the most horrifying and scariest games of hide 'n seek you will ever play, and it hits home for Alien lore fans such as myself.\n\nYou play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), who is an aerospace engineer that has received a job to do at the Sevastapol space station, with added hopes of finding what happened to her mother aboard the lost ship, the Nostromo.\n\nWithout going through spoilers, you traverse through what seems like a peaceful, yet unmaintained, space station, when things just keep breaking down and getting worse.  There are multiple threats you will encounter throughout the game, all of which you need to act accordingly.  You will sometimes be faced with the thought that you will have to SHOOT your way out of things, or simply run away--but that is NOT always the best option, as you-know-who will likely be hunting you.  And ohhh **** is it scary.  If and when you need to hide, Amanda has many gadgets she can craft using random materials she finds aboard the station--flashbangs, smoke grenades, noisemakers, are just a few of them--or she can simply hide under desks, in lockers, behind hard corners, etc.  When all else fails, there is a trusty weapon she can acquire (again, no spoilers) that she used in the movie.\n\nThis game is a very, very long game for an adventure horror game, and even at the easiest difficulty, your first playthrough will take nearly 20 hours, or possibly a lot longer.  Although replaying the game serves no purpose for the storyline, it can be fun (and stressful) to play through it again (and again) for achievements and/or collectibles.

(However I have heard others have had issues, I suggest checking the forums before and after purchase if you experience any)\n-Some amazing jaw dropping scenery and moments in this game, that leave you going "Oh shi-"\n\nCons\n-Game can be frustrating, enemies might block a door and decide to just not leave, Alien might find you despite you not really doing anything to really put yourself in that situation, just because of bad luck. Another example is sometimes the Alien is magic and literally in two different spots at once, like you see him drooling and look at another vent and he is drooling from that one too, and if you go under either he spawns there and kills you.\n-AI sometimes will be a derp. Usually it's really good, and if it hears you or such it will come running, it cuts you off, etc, but every once in a while it will just like look directly at you 3 feet away and just miss you. This is rare, but it really breaks immersion when the AI does things like this.\n-Lack of features to take advantage of next gen hardware/PCs, while it looks great as is, it pretty much looks the exact same across everything.\n-Tedious space walks, lever and button pushing, it will seem great at first but it will wear on you much later in the game, when it's a lot of filler to draw out the game unecessarily.\n-Alien can take an unrealistic amount of damage even a dedicated Alien fan might go "That is a bit much". At one point it took a burst from a flame thrower, 4 shot gun blasts to the chest/head, a pipebomb, and a revolver to the head and chest 3 times, and all that did is stun it for 3 seconds before killing me. (I won't spoil anything, but the arguement people may have for this, becomes obselete later in the game, is all I will say.)\n-Garbage Ending! I mean terrible, terrible ending.\n-Sometimes the sound seems out of sync, in dialogue cutscenes and a few actions, buts its a rare and small bug\n\n\n7.8/10\nUnderstanding the Alien universe is a big help in enjoying this game, but it achieves what it aims to do fairly well. I am happy with my purchase. The ending leaves a lot to be desired and it is not perfect, but what makes this game good is almost always present and undeniable.

As a spin-off of the first Alien movie, the space station in which the game takes place mixes futuristic technologies and 70s stuff, while the general atmosphere of anxiety and loneliness is very true to the movie and perfectly realized with an amazing light usage. Like a true survival you have no chance to win a fight against the alien. You have to hide, reducing the noise as much as possible and only rely on your crafting abilities to survive: running will be your last card to play against such a superior specimen. Sound effects are great, your hearing being the first sense helping to evaluate your moves.\nThe AI is the pearl of the game: the alien will hunt you and trick you in such ways that will test your nerves, because revealing yourself will mean certain death.\nThere isn't any single breath you can take in this struggle. The tension will be high and constant and eventually leads to make bad decisions.\nThis is such a clever game, wonderfully realized within a vivid ambientation: a game not only Alien fans should play.\n\n93/100","May 13, 2015","true","39.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Lighting was a strong point.\n-----The alien looked good, it moved very fluidly and was very convincing. It was nerve racking when it was Stomping around just centimetres away from my hiding spots. Detailed closeups of characters during dialogue and cutscenes also looked pretty good.\n-----The Sci-Fi world was faithful to the original film and period. It was the ‘future of the 80’s’. I was very happy to see a retro style world which didn’t try to look cute or goofy. One of the most impressive yet slow and uneventful sections was the space-walk on the space station exterior. There were massive satellite dishes and the you could get a good view of the station’s colossal towers.\n\nI had a very confused introduction to combat. I thought stealth would be the only solution to hostile encounters. I spent an hour or so of my time playing the game not making any progress until I figured this out.\n-----Next thing, save stations sometimes didn’t seem to feature frequently enough or sometimes I would miss them completely. The autosave feature didn’t always work at logical points in the game. After dying which happened frequently, I could find myself losing 15 minutes or more of gameplay. Plus I often had to repeat tasks and uneventful sequences again and again which became tedious as cool as they were.\n-----Being able to save manually at any time could have been used to avoid this. Many things which I had to repeat in the game just weren’t necessary. Meaning that I spent comparatively less time engaging in more interesting action\n-----Gunplay is actually very jerky in this game. Guns are hard to use accurately and fire very slowly. You have no access to automatic weaponry at all. Most weapons are rudimentary or makeshift. You will not feel like a badass marine or one woman army. You are very vulnerable. This was a very strong aspect to the the gameplay experience\n\n-----The Alien lurks in many sections of the game. You can’t kill it. But if it get’s a hold of you it will kill you instantly, and it did so to me frequently.\n-----Some items will cause it to retreat for a short time. But your supplies are very limited. For the most part you must hide and sneak around it. Being able to duck under furniture was a very cool way to do this.\n-----The alien’s movement patterns were very unpredictable. When it’s gone and I thought it was safe to come out, it would often re-appear suddenly and unexpectedly. Graphics aside the Alien A.I. was the best and most important feature of the game.\n-----Dealing with the Alien was very challenging and intense. The section which first really featured the alien would only take a few minutes to walk through if it wasn’t present. However because of my frequent deaths it took me around an hour to get through. For this reason sometimes long sections featuring the Alien could actually become tiresome.\n-----But there are occasionally stages where the Alien is not present. This was a welcome change of pace.\n-----The other main adversaries are the working Joe androids. They are very tough. But they’re very slow and even large groups of them can be easily dispatched without taking a scratch. However they can be very unnerving if you’re in a confined area and several of them are converging on you.\n\nIt took me around 20 hours to complete Alien: Isolation in the hardest difficulty. I think that was too long. I would have been happier to get through the main storyline in only half that time. Because I feel that I often found myself in the same situation repeatedly only in different places.\n-----Also the ending wasn’t conclusive. I don’t think any full game should end with what is essentially a teaser.\n-----But I still enjoyed it overall. It’s an extremely impressive Alien game. It was really satisfying to have a game in the franchise that wasn’t a massive disappointment, it’s really done it justice.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","November 8, 2014","true","21.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Every playthrough being another nightmare, every encounter a new threat. Although, fair warning - Halfway through the game (That is, if you're sparing with flamethrower fuel) the game loses it's edge. Not that it's bad, just less terrifying, more tense.\n\n\nFrom the locker you've been hiding in for the past hour, you finally hear nothing. You check your motion tracker - All good. Making an effort to pace yourself down the narrow hallways, you take time to plan your new route and note any hiding places. The last group of androids you stumbled upon costed you all of your gear, save for one molotov. After making it through several hallways, finding almost no useful supplies, you stop, hearing movement to your right. Below? No, whatever it is, it's above you. You swat your flashlight off, and dash under the nearest bed. Before you can even check your tracker again, something crashes into the ground next to you. An undescribable scream pierces the air, as if announcing how unsafe this area has now become. You can only see it's tail now, inches away from your feet.\nAcross from you lies the key to your escape, your survival, it is of a course, a vent.\nThe creature walks away, But you can hear it in the distance. Hunting. Under pressure, a decision must be made. Hide until it inevitably finds you, or make a break for the vent?\nTrying your best not to gather it's attention, you dive into the vent.\nYou weren't fast enough.\nIt heard you.\nIt's coming.\nDon't panic.\nYou aren't doomed.\nYou have one option.\nThe vent is opening.\n\nTHERE IT IS.\n\nHurling it as hard as you can, the molotov soars through the metal passageway.\nWith it's impact comes a sound of distress alike to none you've heard before.\nAs it storms off, you take this chance to crawl to your destination. Finally safe, you think to yourself. Strolling through the corridor with a new courage about you.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the last thing you ever thought of before you made the mistake of walking under that vent.\n\n\n\n10/10 would have a heart attack again, go pick it up y'wads.","November 17, 2014","true","45.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","9","16","3","0"

Honestly it is dull, there is no tension (not after seeing the Alien the first few times) because nothing breaks the tension of the game and the awesome experience of the space station as much as the Alien itself!\n\nThats right, the main protagonist is the least interesting part of the game.\n\nIf there was some sense of 'my' actions being the cause for the Xenomorph turning up and getting nasty. If there was a way to hide (in abject fear) whilst waiting for the Alien to get bored and go looking for space noms elsewhere it would work. But instead the Alien just 'lingers'. It is there and stomps around like your partner when they have had a bad day and are looking to get angry at you for some reason.\n\nI found i was just as successful, and enjoyed the experience as much, just dying/loading instead of making the effort to hide too much.

This is a triumph in gaming. The reviewer who reviewed this from IGN doesn’t know his ♥♥♥♥ from his elbows. What an amazing game. Well, I say game. It’s not so much as a game as an experience. This is the Alien Experience and the true sequel to Ridley Scotts original vision. This game is a masterpiece in gaming history. It won’t be for everyone’s tastes, sure. This is the classic vintage; a glass of red wine, a tipple of single malt whiskey with a dash of tepid water served on chilled amazeballs.\n\nFor any fans of Ridley Scott’s first film this will allow you to live the nightmare … and it’s freakin awesome. It’s like playing a new Alien movie with a great plot, great actors, creepy henchmen, and an absolutely fantastic lead villain, oh and not to forget an absolutely wonderful little voice performance from the most awesome Sigourney Weaver. With just a moment she adds a touch of class to an already brilliant piece of Art.\nGraphically stunning, the visual design was beautiful right from the very opening moments of inhabiting Ripley’s body. The lighting, the smoke effects, all the little attentions to detail thrust me right into Servastopol. It’s like wandering the sets of the original movie and it ran like a dream on my machine. I rarely find games that will run at top graphics and run well. This had no trouble at all. The optimization was spot on.\n\nThe opening Act was nothing short of Oscar worthy. By the end of it I had Ripley cowering in a corner and I had a smile on my face so big it hurt. I was terrified and loving it. The music just kept building and building and I found myself wanting to shout at that little f*&(#$ to stop toying with me and come get me. That experience alone was worth the price tag for the game. The rest was just icing on the cake. People have complained about the length. Fools. This game just keeps giving. And don’t be put off by one of the earlier levels. The designers switch it up during the game; they just give you a taste of the rough stuff early on to keep you on your toes throughout the rest of the ordeal, though I will admit, there was a point during this level where I thought to myself, ‘if it is like this for the rest of the game this won’t be a fun experience.’ Take heart, this is just a tough level.\n\nAnd one cannot even begin to praise this game without first giving a nod and a tip of the hat to the sound design which is nothing short of spectacular. If Oscars were given to games the sound design for this game would most definitely win and be praised for years to come. Listening to that little f*&$%$ crawling around in the vents above you fills you with all the right emotions. The sound of the dying station creaking and moaning submerses you into the game world. The soundtrack immerses you into the world and builds at times in such a wonderful way it makes your heart thump all the louder.\n\nThe AI of the alien is excellent. During my time on Sevastopol I really felt like I was being hunted. Watching that creature from the shadows filled me with dread as it actually appeared to be trying to seek me out. I often felt like it knew I was there or, at least, that I had recently been there not long before. And sometimes I even felt like it was trying to trick me to come out of hiding just by the way it acted. I was hid under a table at one time and waited quite some time before plucking up the courage to head for the door, just mere meters from my position. At one point I watched on my sensor as the Alien raced off through the vents at great speed. I was about to come out when the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ came racing right back and dropped from a nearby vent with a hiss.\n\nAs with any form of art opinions will differ. This will not be everyone’s cup of tea. But for those of you who love computer games for what they can do, what boundaries they can push, like the wonderful Half Life in its glory days. This is one of those games that will be remembered and not just for the amazing visuals, Oscar worthy sound design or even the most worthy AI of the exomorph hunting you, but also for the way it weaves the story. Telling story can be hard in games, especially first person shooters. This does it superbly. The link to the original movie is perfect for sucking you right into the universe. It is not a complicated story. It is simple and all it needs to be to experience the horror Ripley experiences on her journey to Savastopol. And what a journey it is.\n\nThere are so many little touches that I would love to share about the game but that would just serve to spoil. All I would say is, don’t read spoilers or how-to’s, and don’t watch play-throughs or walkthroughs. Go in knowing as little as possible. Throughout my play-through I was often pleasantly surprised at the twists this game took and the places it dared to tread through the Ripley Scott classic. I often found myself guessing seconds before and saying “Nooooooooo,” as I realized the horror the game was placing me in next.  But each time that smile would return as I would relish the beautiful sci-fi horror of it all. 10 out of freakin’ 10.","January 23, 2015","true","27.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Alien Isolation stays true to the original 1979 Alien flim in terms of technology, music, and artstyle while making it an terrifying, but graphically beautiful modern video game. Instead of being gung-ho and shooting aliens, you are defenseless against it and the best solution is avoid direct contact at all times and survive.\n\nThe alien in the game is brutal... you will have to keep your wits together and always keep an eye out for him and any possible escape routes and hidey holes in your surroundings in case things go sour. The alien will also try many ways tricking in getting you out from hiding spots when you're least expected so always keep looking your motion tracker and try not to keep it up too long otherwise it will hear your motion tracker beeping like a christmas tree. I won't spoil too much about the game, you will have to play it yourself and experience the horror.\n\nI have finished the game including the DLC and my experience with the game has been awesome! I love it with a passion and glad the developers stick true to the original flim and inputting the survival horror aspect. I highly recommend this game to any Sci-Fi and Alien fans!

You go to a remote free port space station called the Sevastopol, but you quickly realize that things went horribly wrong. As in the first movie, you only face a single Alien.\n\nThe Alien's AI is pretty solid, he will easily spot you if he has a direct line of sight. Running is risky, as he will hear you and he easily outruns you. Even inside a locker, he can hear you breathe and the vents aren't safer, as he uses them himself. The Alien also one-hit kills you. While is behavior isn't scripted, he will always be in your general area.\n\nTo help you, you are given a motion tracker, but as it does make a beeping noise, you must use it with caution. You also get a flamethrower, but ammo for it is very rare.\n\nThe Xenomorph isn't the only threat, as robots become aggressive against everyone and hostile human gangs form inside the space station. To add to the overall tension, there are no checkpoints, you can only manually save the game in phone booths scattered across the station, so dying can mean going back and redo a considerable portion of the game.\n\nThe graphics are outstanding with the lightning and steam effects perfectly fitting the theme. The retro futuristic style is perfectly nailed being in sync with the movies. The only negative part of the game for me was the ending, it largely hints a sequel or dlc and it doesn't give you any closure, and in a game where closure was so important, it ends up being a missed opportunity.\n\nAlien: Isolation might be frustrating at times, as you will die... a lot, but the constant tension and thrilling story make it one of the best games of 2014!","November 18, 2014","true","39.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead of following the tropes of recent AAA games, the open world environment of the Sevastopol space station is not yours - it's the Xenomorphs hunting ground and you're just another living piece of food. And that lead to the mixed reviews it initially received: the game plays with you.\n\nThe game doesn't take you by the hand. Where other sneaky action games like Dishonored are power fantasies and present the players stealth abilities as a strength to overpower your enemies, hiding is your only option to survive. Alien: Isolation is extremely slow, it's repetitive (depending on how much you die) and it's unfair - and that's why I'm absolutely in love with it.","December 18, 2014","true","31.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Alien Isolation is the most tense adrenaline filled and frightfully jumpy sci-fi experience since Dead Space.\n\nAfter playing 5 minutes of the game I was having trouble just picking up the controller, the game instantly get's under your skin,  I found this out when playing the DLC - Lone Survivor, but after half-hour, I put on my Ellen-Ripley-Cap said to myself lets do this.\n\n\nI saw myself a veteran gamer I have completed many (space, horror and shoot-em-up's) on the most unforgiving veteran mode surely Alien Isolation could be no different. Only trouble is... I was unprepared just how powerless you are in the game, and just how easy it is to die, your only real strength you have in the game is to be as stealthy as you can and avoid making any noise and move undetected.\n\nNormally this does the trick you can get through the game with ease but  I was playing the game on hard difficulty. The slightest sound foot-step or gun-shot and you will have a terrifying "Xenomorph" dropping out of the vent's or chasing you down the corridor screaming, if It see's you and sometimes you might not here it all while it creeps up on you sticks you with it's tail from behind.\n\n\n\nHow  to survive Exenomorph!\n\nThe deciding factor's when the alien comes stomping your way and the option's you have available should you hide, run or escape the area or should you use an item to distract it?\n\nPro-tip from me: NEVER EVER RUN IN THIS GAME, you are basically walking silver platter with  if you run.\n\n\nWhen you decide to hide and considering your options: Should you hide under a desk or should you hide in a locker?\n\nThink you are safe in the lockers think again...\n\nThe alien will stalk the area your in and if you come out too early and feel you need to re-enter the same locker or another locker, I would not advice it. The alien listen's for you and adapt's to the situation, what may have worked a few times may not always work 3rd, 4th, or 5th time, stay on the move and use lockers and cabinets sparingly.\n\n\nSave Station\n\nI cannot stress enough how important it is to save while playing Alien Isolation, doesn't matter what difficulty you are playing on, no matter what you will die at some point, that I guarantee, before you start thinking:\n\nI am not going to play this there no auto save!\n\nKeep in mind this adds to the tension and fun of the game and every save is a reward in-itself.\n\nI found this out more so on Dr Morely Section of the Game, I know this might sound counter productive but if you get objective done and the alien is near by, this is what I do if I can see the alien on the scanner and it's behind me sometimes it's ok to run, but only run if you need to save, atleast this way you stand less chance of the alien coming stalking your way and you would have saved yourself another trip if you got killed taking too safely and slowly.\n\n\n\nThe scanner\n\nUse the scanner wisely and try not to use it too much on hard difficulty, the alien can here the scanner beep noise, especially if you are hiding in a locker, the alien might just stay in the area longer.\n\n\nDeaths\n\nI will not lie, I died many times, so much so that I got achievement out of it, the game will punish you at every turn, every area is designed to make your journey as difficult to complete as possible like true horror game. The game will brutally satisfyingly want to work against  you at all times, this is no "Call of Duty Action Game", this is "Survival Horror" remember that when you start playing otherwise you might not make it to the credits-end.\n\n\nObjectives\n\nAre done in such way you will end up having to do multiple things in one area and might end up finding yourself back tracking allot when a door is down due to a faulty power generator or a password is needed from access terminal or you might need to hack into something and complete a mini-game, this add's so much tension to the game, the last thing you want to do is back track when Exenomorph hiding in the vents or stomping around.\n\n\nWeapons and Items\n\nYou have limited amount of weapon's and tool's at your disposal which can be upgraded and obtained throughout Sevastopol and you will have to use each and everyone one of them sparingly.\n\nI stayed away from using as many item's as possible because they attracted the beast even though you can use the item's to lore the alien and kill  humans or use item's as a distraction by doing so the alien will stay in the vicinity and it will take longer to complete that section of the game most of the time the Alien will scan the area until it think it's ok to go back in the vents, because of this I try and avoid using as many item's as possible and just stick with being stealthy.\n\nOn hard difficulty, the alien can be just as unpredictable and sometimes avoiding the alien can be impossible at times, so always have a few Molotov-cocktail's ready and the flamethrower to fend the alien off, but remember if you do manage to scare the alien off move out that area as soon as possible the alien might  come back to check if you are still there do not rely on the flamethrower, as your main defense but as a last-resort.\n\nAmmo and items are scarce on hard difficulty and the alien at times can be relentless so be resourceful as much as possible stay hidden.\n\n\nHumans\n\nWhen you come across a group of humans or just one, most of the time they will be hostile toward's you and try and shoot you if they can, If they do choose to shoot you and  the alien is near by the alien will here the gun-shots and go straight for the human, think about using this as a tactic while playing as I did when escaping the Medical Facility.\n\n\nDroids not your average Joe's\n\nThe droids in the game can be just as dangerous and bothersome and take quite a beating to put one out of action, as I found out when I fired 9 Revolver bullets into head of a droid before it went down. What I found worked best was to craft  EMP device and use this on the droid and then use your wench while it was temporary disabled to kill it. The stun-rode is some what effective against them but best to use it when they are unaware of your presence and from behind, once you got the droid going berserk with the stun rod this is your moment to kill it with the wench.\n\n\nThe exenomorph\n\nOn hard difficulty the Exenomorph is allot like an overly attached girlfriend....\n\nIt will not be that far away and it will pop-out the vents when it feel's like it and sometimes I have witnessed it falling back out of the vents, only to go back in again. When I thought it was going to be game-over for me.\n\nThe alien on hard mode is unpredictable put it this way.\n\nStay invisible from start to finish only way survive! and move all the time never linger the alien will detect you hunt you down if you stay to long in one area, always stay on the move.\n\nMove undetected don't let anyone see or hear you and you will complete the game more quickly, as this was my main strategy.\n\nAs you progress through the game you are going to come up against some scripted Alien area's where it's going to be impossible to avoid the alien, I found this to happen allot in the Gemini area of the game while I was trying to complete a task: That had me logging in to the access terminal twice!!! and pulling two lever's while having a droid and exenomorph on the look out.\n\n\nSevastopol in Game Map\n\nI found trying to move from one area to another to be frustrating as the in game map, does not indicate which door's can be opened and which doors cannot, vent's location's do not always display on the map.

The buyer gets his money’s worth within the first few hours of this atmospheric Sci-Fi Horror game if racing heartbeat and sweaty palms are a measure. Mostly I play action or soldier games and usually I’m running into the action even if I have to replay an area several times to get to the next. But frustration is the dominant feeling in those games, not the dread and terror of creeping down a dimly lit corridor, all the while hearing bumping and thumping all around and above me (and the unsettling soundtrack) as the alien hunts for me. The squawky detector is a help to tell you when the alien is near but sometimes the random pips and scratches send a false alarm that need to be checked out.\n\nFans of the Alien series of movies will love wandering around the nearly-abandoned, deep-space manufacturing complex which truly captures the look and feel of the style in the movies. But it’s obvious that something went very wrong here, and it’s your job to explore where needed to fulfill the missions (rather than Chapters) as the game progresses.\n\nThe difficulty can be changed under Options but only within the game.  Game Save is only allowed at specific stations which means in some levels you have to redo many minutes of nerve-shattering creeping around only to get skewered again by “that thing”. So I recommend taking the time to slink back to the save station when mini-tasks are completed even when it’s out of your way and you’d rather not backtrack more than you have to.  Another minor complaint is the sometimes contrived reason you have to put yourself in harm’s way but that is just another convention of the genre.\n\nThere are many visual and auditory references to iconic games such as Half-Life and Portal (and probably others I miss). An earlier Alien game got terrible reviews due to hang-up and crashing problems but this one is a winner on par with these other benchmark games. If you don’t want to buy it at the reasonable market pricing at least put it on your Steam wishlist and buy it when you get the email that it’s on sale. That will limit your financial exposure, but nothing but heightened awareness and a fuelled-up flamethrower will protect you when you creep out of your hiding place to see what’s beyond the next sliding door…\n\n(Here's a great trailer that shows players' reactions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EWe69vP1pA )","January 3, 2015","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AppTRL/recommended/214490/","AppTRL","AppTRL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AppTRL/","230 products in account","I like this game. I really do. I absolutely recommend getting this game when it's on sale (Even at a price of 40-50 dollars, this is still a solid buy for a 15-25 hour long campaign).  However, I have really mixed feelings about this game, similar to the reviewers who rated this game on Gamespot and IGN.  While I think their final verdict is wrong, I feel they had some good constructive criticism about certain aspects of this game that I feel are getting glossed over because of the anger of the scores they gave this game.  Therefore, I'm going to try to write something that will help skeptic buyers eying this game understand the difference between those reviewing this game on Steam and those reviewing this on IGN and Gamespot.\n\nThe main crux of this game is that this is simply not a game about closure.  If you are playing this game looking for a payoff, this is not your game.  The plot of the game (while brilliantly paced toward its first four or so hours) begins to deteriorate toward the middle of the game. It simply does not know how to end itself.  It also doesn’t help that the main cast of characters rank from developed but underused to undeveloped but overused. Do *not* play this game expecting Amanda Ripley’s personal journey of finding out what happened to her mother to be front and center in the narrative.  Frankly, by midway in the game, she’s just a shell for the player.  In short, this is not the type of game that is “fun” to play and isn't looking to "reward" to its player upon its completion….which is why the reviewers at sites like IGN and Gamespot ultimately gave negative feedback concerning this game.\n\nWhat this game is an Alien immersion simulator.  The art and audio teams behind this game did their homework on the Alien lore to perfection.  This is probably the only Alien game in existence to fully capture Ridley Scott’s universe and H.R. Giger’s terrifying vision of the Alien. Everything is there…the lightning, the fog, the retro technology….it’s all perfect.  I’m not going to retread what other reviewers have said about the gameplay.  It’s a great cat-and-mouse game that only gets interrupted by an abnormal difficulty spike in a medical ward and the game’s messy writing calling for an Alien-free section toward midway in the game.  Yes, it is frustrating, but the immersion factor keeps you playing.  If you are anything like me, you’ll be more connected to the complicated history of Sevastopol (told through the computer and audio logs of its residents) than you ever will be with the main characters of the game.\n\nThe best way I can summarize this game is that it captures everything about the original Alien movie *except* a cast of great characters and a sense of conclusion.  This is a game that only will ever truly seem to stop until you simply stop playing it.  This game is indeed a triumph for the Alien franchise, but lacks the storytelling and sense of climax and closure the first Alien movie us.  It’s not a game you can replay to get served the same enjoyable meal again; it’s more like to experience the same mental high that will satisfy, but ultimately fade away and leave you burnt out until the next time you are ready to experience the terror of the Alien once more.","December 23, 2014","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, Alien: Isolation redeems that idea of that terrifying, scary, and 80's feeling from the first film.

I can honestly say that, "Yes" this game is the best out of the Alien Franchise. It really does give you the feel of the first Alien movie with Sigourney Weaver within its dark rustic atmosphere. You can hear many audibles that they actually used within the Alien movie itself as you progress.\nSome reviewers claimed that the Alien is scripted when it is not. I don't know where they got that idea because the Alien is totally RANDOM within its hunting, paths and appearances. You will die in this game, but the amount of deaths will totally be reliant on your gaming style. I always kept on the move for the most part and actually went through some areas with very little contact with the Alien. Even though I could hear him banging around in the vents above my head.\nYou can even play through the game, as I did, with very little use of the crafted weapons available to you throughout the game. Again, it all depends on your playing style.\nThe graphics are well done, but once in awhile you might see floating static artifacts such as a tool or phone where either you or a NPC were earlier. Sounds within the game are also spot on, but I play my games with the music off so I don't know if the scores are good or not. I heard that they were though.\nThe story line was fairly well done too, but the ending is.....well I'll leave that up to you on what you think.\nGameplay is very fluid, but for some reason once in awhile my character had problems standing up even though I kept hitting the button.\nThe main gripe that I have with Alien Isolation is that the alien always seemed to know where I was no matter how qiuet I was in the levels. Sometimes it was downright frustrating and unrealistic how the Alien would always zero in on my position by either following me through the vents in the ceiling or prowling the area always right up to the locker I was hiding in. Once in awhile; however, the Alien would leave the area which was a sigh of relief for exploring some areas.\nOverall, Alien Isolation is worth the purchase especially if you see it on sale like I did.

Unfortunately due to the save points being pretty far apart at times this is starting to make the game rather repetitive and frustrating.\n\nI guess the good points are:\n\nThe game has a great atmosphere.  The corridors of the Sevastopol look great and it really does feel like you are stuck on a space station.  The lighting effects and smoke combined with the creaking and groaning of the metal of the ship add to this greatly.\nThere is definitely a sense of tension, panic and urgency when playing. You don't really ever feel like you can relax after the first encounter with the Alien.  I spend the whole game crouched!\nNice use of logs to build the story but also the other NPCs add to the story - I wasn’t really expecting there to be other people in the game.  (Just Ripley and the Alien)\n\nThe Bad:\nSeemingly random Alien attacks.  For realisms sake this makes sense but in the game it is just far too frustrating - at one point I was running to escape from someone and the alien grabbed me from an air vent above with no real warning.  Another time I was trying to make my way to a save point when it appeared behind me and tore me in two.  Whilst the deaths are mildly amusing the lack of frequent AutoSaves mean you have to go and play through large sections again.\nThe Stealth... sometimes it works well but other times it becomes almost too hard to stay hidden.  The motion tracker is more of a hidrence to this.  It would have been good to have some sort of indicator similar to the one used in Metro Last Light to let you know when you are visible.\nThe music - in the end I have turned this off.  It drowned out a lot of the noises you needed to hear and although it added to the tension it just became annoying.\nAs I have already mentioned the lack of save points.  There really needs to be save points when going between sections of the game.  I don’t always have that much time to spend playing a game so always appreciate the ability to save when you need to.  If the player wants to save every five minutes - let them....it doesn’t change the gameplay just removes some frustration.\n\n\nI really do want to like this game and It has exceeded my expectations but they we set pretty low.... I think I could recommend it but I found that I enjoyed the much-slated Thief remake much more than this so far.\n\nSo if you haven’t bought thief.... maybe get that cheap until the price of this drops!\n\nFor now this is a not recommended - if an update changes something with the save points this may change.\n\n**edited out typos**","October 8, 2014","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

This is the game we've all been waiting for, long expecting a game of intense atmosphere and horror for the Alien franchise. A game where we are no longer on equal fighting ground with the Alien but more-so at its mercy.\n\nThe game offers a brilliantly designed and crafted sturctural world of dark corridors, sparking lights, that eerie space station feel of vast emptiness and isolation and of course, one of our favourite creatures of all time: Alien. But alas Alien is not the only problem on the Space Station Sevastopol, other survivors and killer androids are also a thing to keep an eye out for as well as a variety of planning, strategy and careful timing to complete each objective you are faced with.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nThey did really well with the graphics and rendering of the space station itself as well as all the models of characters and Ai Controlled. The lighting of the game really helps to envelop you in the tense and dreary world you find yourself in for most of the game. Blood spatter, broken structural mainframe, the classic Sci-Fi feel of the original Alien world and even Alien drool, this was really well done and I loved it all.\n\nMusic: 10/10\nWe all know how music and sounds can affect the outcome of a game by either bringing its full potential to fruition or utterly destroying the feel of the game, the designers nailed this games music and sounds. From the Alien crawling around in the vents, to the sheer terror of a music buildup as an enemy approaches your hiding place, I personally think it affected the overall feel and atmosphere of the game and bought what I was hoping to be, to be even better than what I ahd expected.\n\nAtmosphere: 10/10\nThe Atmosphere? Terrifying to say the least if you really put yourself in Amada's place and forget the outside world, lights off, surround sound, high graphics. The Atmosphere of the game is only as good as YOU want it to be and for me, it's an experience I won't soon forget. This game has one of the most strongest atmosphere's of horror and survival over any other game I've played\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nBeing difficult to see and keeping your flashlight off so you don't attract unwanted attention, the game offers a brilliant variety of stealth and distraction techniques you need to employ in order to progress through and to keep your body intact. The construction of in-game items plays a major role in easing your stealth tactics and giving you access to a variety of traps and distraction tools to use at will. Hiding and bypassing Humans, Androids and the Alien alike were all to my liking as I am a very cautious person in these sorts of games and am not hasty in my decision making.\n\nOverall, if you want my advice for the most optimal experience for this game, turn off your lights, play alone in your room with a headset on, put the graphics as high as your PC can run them and play on the hardest difficulty like I did. This is just my opinion on what you should do though, you can decide what to do for yourself.","October 23, 2014","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AppTRL/recommended/214490/","AppTRL","AppTRL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AppTRL/","230 products in account","I like this game. I really do. I absolutely recommend getting this game when it's on sale (Even at a price of 40-50 dollars, this is still a solid buy for a 15-25 hour long campaign).  However, I have really mixed feelings about this game, similar to the reviewers who rated this game on Gamespot and IGN.  While I think their final verdict is wrong, I feel they had some good constructive criticism about certain aspects of this game that I feel are getting glossed over because of the anger of the scores they gave this game.  Therefore, I'm going to try to write something that will help skeptic buyers eying this game understand the difference between those reviewing this game on Steam and those reviewing this on IGN and Gamespot.\n\nThe main crux of this game is that this is simply not a game about closure.  If you are playing this game looking for a payoff, this is not your game.  The plot of the game (while brilliantly paced toward its first four or so hours) begins to deteriorate toward the middle of the game. It simply does not know how to end itself.  It also doesn’t help that the main cast of characters rank from developed but underused to undeveloped but overused. Do *not* play this game expecting Amanda Ripley’s personal journey of finding out what happened to her mother to be front and center in the narrative.  Frankly, by midway in the game, she’s just a shell for the player.  In short, this is not the type of game that is “fun” to play and isn't looking to "reward" to its player upon its completion….which is why the reviewers at sites like IGN and Gamespot ultimately gave negative feedback concerning this game.\n\nWhat this game is an Alien immersion simulator.  The art and audio teams behind this game did their homework on the Alien lore to perfection.  This is probably the only Alien game in existence to fully capture Ridley Scott’s universe and H.R. Giger’s terrifying vision of the Alien. Everything is there…the lightning, the fog, the retro technology….it’s all perfect.  I’m not going to retread what other reviewers have said about the gameplay.  It’s a great cat-and-mouse game that only gets interrupted by an abnormal difficulty spike in a medical ward and the game’s messy writing calling for an Alien-free section toward midway in the game.  Yes, it is frustrating, but the immersion factor keeps you playing.  If you are anything like me, you’ll be more connected to the complicated history of Sevastopol (told through the computer and audio logs of its residents) than you ever will be with the main characters of the game.\n\nThe best way I can summarize this game is that it captures everything about the original Alien movie *except* a cast of great characters and a sense of conclusion.  This is a game that only will ever truly seem to stop until you simply stop playing it.  This game is indeed a triumph for the Alien franchise, but lacks the storytelling and sense of climax and closure the first Alien movie us.  It’s not a game you can replay to get served the same enjoyable meal again; it’s more like to experience the same mental high that will satisfy, but ultimately fade away and leave you burnt out until the next time you are ready to experience the terror of the Alien once more.","December 23, 2014","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sound and the setting of the game is based on the first Alien movie from 1979. There is alot to discover. I stopped and looked very carefully at EVERYTHING and I was so fascinated from all the details. Upholstered walls, clunky computers and old technology, the original and chilling soundtrack from the movie + there are tons of logbooks and audiofiles for you to read or listen to (even from the Nostromo-Crew, how AWSOME is that??).

You are given mutliple choices how to avoid him, from making contraptions from the items you craft to initialising secondary systems and of course you can keep low profile and hide wherever it's possible(some places let us hide in them like lockers or we can go through vants which seems to be very useful).

It reacts to sounds, movement even your breathing.\nYou don't get some impressive arsenal of weapons, instead what you get is the most impressive way to test your survival skills. Use a noise distraction? Perhaps a Molotov cocktail to scare it away? Hide....hold your breath and wait for the chance to sneak by? Scavange for supplies.\nNot only is the Alien about but like in real life peoples primal instinct to survive sets in. People will attack you for your gear, or simply because they think you'll take their's. Lure the Alien in and let it take them out perhaps?

First off i'd like to say I had my doubts about this one after the colonial marines dissapointment and waiting so long for it to come out. However, in this instance i'm happy to report that Isolation is 10x better than any other Alien game to date so far in my opinion. They've done a real good job so far in the minor time i've been playing, best of all, it makes want to play more which Colonial didn't.\n\nThe main point of the atmosphere is to inspire fear and terror in the shadows and sounds, i'd say they've achieved that brilliantly here. As you move through the levels, the distant sounds and lighting effects create a trapped feeling and maybe that something is truely lurking around every corner. And the level design is quite detailed as well increasing the immersion effect dramatically.\n\nAdd on the use of survival skills and items you need to collect along with the revolver and such, it's become a nice package to play. A simple but effective system for the player to take control of and use to their own play styles, stealth or all out attack but personally i'd recommend stealth in this one.\n\nOverall then, i'd say this is the Alien game we'd been waiting for since Alien Vs Predator all those years ago. And finally they've delivered it to us in a brilliant way, love it and will continue to play. :)","October 7, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As the release date drew near, my worry only grew as terrible reviews were submitted by places like IGN.  I have to say- I was really regretting my purchase, especially because of the fact that I was so excited that I bought the version with the season pass and dlc's and everything.  However, I was able to pre-load the game and when I began playing it, all my worry faded as deep immersion and legitamate terror created one of the most pleasant horror survival experiences I have ever had.  I am completely satisfied with this game.  My only few complaints would be the occasional glitch, the couple of times the human or android AI seems to be a little stupid (the xenomorph alien AI has allows been hyper intelligent), and a few of the voice acting lines in the start of the campaign (specifically from Amanda Ripley) are a little poorly given.  With that said, none of these minor problems interrupt my immersion or absolute love of this incredible game.  If you are a fan of the original Alien movie or horror survival as a genre (in the way that Outlast could have been if the AI was smart), then you will love this game.  I rate this game a 9.5 out of 10.","October 7, 2014","true","26.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is spot on, and the feeling of impending doom is like no other.\n\nBe warned though, it does fall into the tropes of many games. Sometimes it is far too like Alien that it breaks belief of it being a legitimate entity on it's own rather than playing off your desire to have explored the set of the Nostromo in first person.\n\nOverall a very rewarding game though, and I intend to sink further time into it once all the DLC is out!","October 28, 2014","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The particle effects that puff when every door opens, the incredible lighting and the particles even had shadows on them, I cannot fault the aesthetics of the game which perfectly recreate and expand upon the films universe. I only ever encountered a few minor visual glitches and some I only picked up on as I am a level designer myself, like a few visible seams and clipping issues but they were so minor and rare its barely worth noting.\n\nThe atmosphere is incredible, you never feel safe ever, even in your hiding spaces you can be caught, the sound design truly helps with this. The foley work and sound effects throughout the entire game are just incredible, every last creak and groan of air ducts really adds to the unease and tension. That's not to say you never get a break, cooldown chapters are interspersed to stop it becoming too stressful, particularly after very tense missions, where you dont have too much danger to deal with. The sound also plays just as important a role as your motion tracker in letting you know where enemies are and when the alien is in the vents.\n\nThe music again is great and the dynamic score can actually aid you as it gets steadily more dramatic as you get closer to being detected. It also helps keep the tension up during the dramatic parts and to spur you on when you are caught and have to either run away or defend yourself.\n\nThe game tutorialises each new enemy really well, they each tend to get their own dedicated chapter which starts of pretty hard until you learn how to avoid each enemy type. You also get new tools along the way and with regards to the backtracking I didnt have any problems as different paths are open or closed, there are different enemies and with your new tools you can find different ways around. There are multiple solutions for getting through the rooms and it was interesting to see the completely different approaches my friends took when playing the game.\n\nStorywise it was pretty good with a few plot twists and turns, some predictable, some not, i thought the ending was ok but not as great as it could have been.\n\nOverall, 10 out of 10 from me, a must play for sci-fi and Alien fans, stunning locations and some fantastic set pieces, with incredible sound design, cannot recommend enough, fantastic.","October 29, 2014","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To keep this review short:\n\nThe good:\n-The game is styled to the way they saw the future when making the first Alien movie, which means computers are massive and nothing really feels modern, even though it takes place in space\n-The alien is unpredictable, the AI of the Xeno is fantastic besides some minor things. Like one time it ran past me while i was in the middle of his path, now don't think you can just run around, because there isn't much you can do when he sees you.\n-Ammo is hard to get, there are guns which can only kill people and the androids, not aliens. Each shot has to be justified as you can't allow to waste a lot of ammo\n-You're hunted, this game does this better than anything I've ever played. Hiding in a closet while hearing humans being brutally murdered one by one. You will die a lot in this game, but it always feels like it was your mistake\n-Graphics are great, the lightning especially is really well done\n\nThe bad:\n-The interactions feel robotic, it's stupid that there are about 4 seconds in between exiting a computer and being able to walk. Anyone can see and kill you during this period. Does capture the horror element quite well, but it just feels unnecessary\n-Not being able to jump over small obstacles, i get the horror element, but do i really need to be stuck to the ground if i can take a shortcut over that small barrier?\n-Story isn't all that interesting, i didn't find any character to be interesting\n\nDefinitely a game I'd recommend, get some surround headphones and this game won't be like anything you've ever played.","October 28, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even players who don't usually like horror games will feel compelled to go on and explore the picture-perfect recreation of the dark, low-high-tech sci-fi vision of the 1979's movie, filled with CRT screens, mechanical computers and steam vents.\n\nThis is not a shooter, so be prepared to hide, crouch through vents, and peer in horror at your motion detector as the beeping green blip comes closer and closer to you while you try to hold your breath and not make a noise.\n\nThe game is difficult, occasionally unfair, and has a checkpoint save system that reminds me of Dark Souls' bonfires. It all works great to build an incredible level of tension and fear, but it will also be frustrating to players who don't want to try something different to modern straightforward shooters with quicksave systems.\n\nTechnically, the game is a wonder.

Everywhere you look there is immense detail, so much work and passion went into this product and it shows.\n\nIt took me about 18 hours to beat the game, which is a really respectful length for a survival-horror game like this.  Some complain it is too long but for me, a fan who has waited a long time to play it, the length felt perfect; I even could have gone for a little more.  You actually get to fully explore the station you're on through the story, unlike games like Dead Space 2 where you only see a tiny fraction of the space of the structure.\n\nThe gameplay is stealth-focused, you're given some tools for deterring your many enemies but mainly you will be sticking to the shadows and hiding in cupboards as you make your way through the game.  The alien, the prime antagonist of the game, is stunningly recreated and an absolute terror to deal with.  This isn't your average horror game enemy, this thing is relentless.  It is smart, it is fast, and it will punish the hell out of you for making a mistake.  The other enemies you face are more forgiving but still deadly and they all have interesting reactions with one another.\n\nThe game uses a manual saving system with save points spread throughout its levels.  For me this was a big plus as it cuts down on save scumming and gives you a real fear of failure, because if you die you may lose progress.\n\nThe story is solid and if you're a fan of the Alien series you will be delighted with all the extra lore this game provides to extend your favorite universe.\n\nI honestly have no solid complaints about this game, some of the early segments can feel too hard but it's only because you don't yet understand what you're doing wrong.

This game doesn't hold your hand, and you'll quickly learn what is getting you killed.\n\nI cannot say enough good things about this game.\n\nCreative Assembly, thank you for returning the Alien franchise to glory, and please bring us more.","October 9, 2014","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its Single player, you play as Ripleys daughter trying to figure out what  has happend to her mother. You  get to a space station that finds a flight recorder of the Nostromo and thats where all hell starts to break loose.  This is really a fun and scary game. It sort of reminds me of Amnesia game but in Alien fashion. The game looks great and the atmosphere of the game is just like in the movie Alien.  The music and sounds of the Alien are amazingly good. You definitely hear the Alien walking about when your trying to hide from him. Really makes the game enjoyable and tense.\n\nYou will Die a lot in this game on Hard, so it will be frustrating, but you'll learn and play on. Same goes with an easier setting, but its a bit more forgiving.  A pro Tip Always save when you have a chance, unless the Alien is close by. The save point will let you know.  So for some reason there is no auto saves/checkpoints. Thats the only con about this game, so save your progress.\n\nAs an Alien fan, I would highly recomend giving this game a try!

The cutscenes are top-notch. The cuts, the camera angles and composition.. someone knew what they were doing. Gameplay wise it's what you'd expect from a survival horror game, resources are scarce, lighting is dim, the fear is constant. And it's not so much the unrelenting onslaught of enemies but rather the atmosphere. You never know what's going to happen. You peak around every corner, sneak everywhere you go because you never know when something will burst out of an access hatch because it heard you stumble around loudly on a metal grate. Which brings me to the sound design, which in my opinion is another area in which the developers went all-in. For the soundtrack they put together a masterpiece of suspense that catches you off guard quite a few times. The entire audio is also very nicely mixed and clear. No distortions or low-quality (which you may or may not notice). Often times you locate threats by the sounds they make. Android chatter, the Alien banging through a vent somewhere. It serves it's purpose wonderfully: To make you afraid.\n\nIn this game you deliberately pace yourself a little more slowly.\nI play it with room darkened after the sun went down with headphones on to really immerse myself in the game.","October 11, 2014","true","45.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The sound design is A class. I did crash a couple of times, but loading times are quick and it took no time at all to get back into the action of hiding.\nNow, considering this is a stealth survival horror, it does get very actiony towards the middle, and people have complained that the alien disappears, but you know what, this section was one of the best.

Finally an Alien game that does the movie justice. The game is played from first person view. While you do find weapons, most of the time it is advised to stay hidden, as humans and androids are not to be trifled with. The Alien will kill you in seconds. The game succeeds in creating the atmosphere of the movies, where the protagonists are weak, but not helpless.\n\nLuckily there is a convenient crafting system that allows you to build things like smoke bombs and medkits. The other important aid is the motion tracker.  Though, while using the motion tracker your vision is blurred and it emits a beep, so it can alert nearby enemies.\n\nGraphic and sound ambience in this game are great, and they do a good job conveying the claustrophobic atmosphere on a space ship. Suprisingly even my humble Geforce 560 GTX runs this on ultra. The cohesive art style in particular is one of the best I have seen in a video game in years. Creative Assembly succeeded in transplanting the late 70s/early 80s art style of the original movies. Particularly the lighting in this game is phenomenal, and huge part why the deserted space station is so creepy. Very similar to System Shock 2 and Bioshock I in gameplay and emotional impact.\n\nTHE BAD:\nNot much to say here. Apart from some glitches like floating weapons I didn't find any bugs. The save system could be annoying to some people who are spoiled by frequent auto saves in other games. This game does not hold your hand, and you need to find save terminals to save the game. Worse, it takes 3 seconds for a terminal to save, so make sure no one is around. I like the system, as it makes progress meaningful, and adds to the suspense.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nGame of the year for me so far. A game that respects the gamer and does not hold his/her hand. Your actions and decisions have real consquences, something that has become far to rare in video games. Gameplay and art style come together beautifully, just like in Bioshock I and Half Life 2. Worth the full price of admission in my mind.","October 11, 2014","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Thats not a bad thing though, those first 2 hours are great, and there was a lot of plot, action, and strealth to be done even without the alien. i think that that proves that you dont even need the alien for this to be a great game. then when you get to the alien, it brings a whole new type of awsome to the game, and i love it. This game reminds me of the Burial at Sea part 2, where there is alot of stealth, moving around, and uncovering a story.\nThe Dark Atmosphere is perfectly done is this game. The lighting and fog effects are beautifully done, and add so much to the great graphics.\nthe Music is amazing. they actually took music from the origianal Alien movie, and extended it into a soundtrack for this game. the music makes the game, with its chilling atmosphere, and suspense, and is perfectly timed with the game.\nThe Alien is amazing. It looks terrifying (i had doubts before i played it, but when combined with 2 hours of buildup, freaky music, and lots of suspense, this moster holds up to the terrifying creature it is), the detail on it is great, and it is so smart. the game reccomends that you play on hard, but you might want to rethink that.\nI havent played the Survival mode or the Expendables mode, but i am phsyched to give it a try.\nOverall, if you like the alien franchise, the stealth genre, or just a good survival horror, you with enjoy this game.","October 7, 2014","true","61.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It will be hard to explain why I loved this game so much without including any spoilers but I'll try.\n\nFirst off... if you like the 1979 film Alien just stop reading now and buy this game.\n\nIf you've never seen the movie (seriously?!) then you MUST watch it first.  It would be criminal to not have seen the movie before playing this.\n\nThe aesthetic matches the original movie so well it's like you've been thrown directly into it... complete with clunky old CRT monitors, mechanical keyboards and cables hanging haphazardly along the walls.  The attention to detail from The Creative Assembly is truly astonishing.  You can tell they have a deep respect for the franchise.  Along with the 70's aesthetic another key point brought over from the movie is that the Alien is essentially immortal.  It is to be feared and respected.  It is death and you will cower from it in lockers and under desks holding your breath.\n\nIn addition to the Alien there are other threats to contend with - other survivors and synthetics known as "Working Joes."  Human survivors can be dealt with rather easily but the Working Joes are another story.  You can shoot them point blank in the face only to be strangled by them while they calmly instruct you to "cease your outburst."  You can set them on fire and they will continue to stalk you informing you that you are "becoming hysterical."  They are creepy to the extreme and add a fantastic element to the game.\n\nIn short this is the antithesis of Alien: Colonial Marines - a comparision that shouldn't even be made (an entirely DIFFERENT developer... many people fail to realize that!).  Pair this with clever and meaningful tie-ins to the original movies including new voicework from the original actors and actresses from the 1979 movie and in my opinion you've got the first meaningful entry in the Alien franchise from the video game medium.\n\nSome will complain that this game is too hard... that the Alien is too powerful or the savepoints too far apart.  Some might find the game simply too scary to play.  I understand these complaints but I do not share them,  I found it to be a terrifying and yet thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish.\n\nIf you choose to play it... well...

The Sevastopol is the most incredible spaceship/station i've every seen in a Sci-Fi-Game, it's like a 70s/80s Sci-Fi Simulator... with a threat.\n\nEverything feels believable especially because of the so well crafted Low-Fi Sci-Fi Setting, everything looks manmade and functional. The hud, and stuff like the in-game map, monitors and interactions with the world like the different hacking mini-games all fit perfectly into the setting.\n\nThe game is like a mixture of System Shock, 2001: Space Odyssey, Moon and ALIEN. Its like a fan-dream come true.\n\nThere's a lot of backtracking, but i like it - you'll get to know the station better, things change and you are free to use the transit-system or lift-system almost everytime to reach places and rooms because of better equipment. it's some sort of "open world-pipe-game", like a spacestation would be in rl.\n\nA few quicktime event-sequences, but nothing to worry about. trial and error passages are limited too. it's all about reading the hints while the game is loading and sticking to what it says.\n\nUnpredictable and very smart Alien-Ai, every playthrough, every encounter is different - seriously, no bs! if you get used to NON-scripted, NON-waypath behaviour, you'll love it and from there on every other game will look like the NPCs are walking on rails. ;)\n\nIn this regard A:I is kind of revolutionary, in other Stealth/Survival Games you just have to stalk your enemy for ~1 Minute to know his movement patterns and behaviour routines to simply decide how to approach the threat. In A:I that tactic won't work! It's hard to tell you more on that without spoiling a big part of the experience for you here... just focus on sound and remember that every type of enemy behaves differently.\n\nVery performant and beautiful self developed engine (rad lighting and shadow effects - seriously one of the best i've ever seen, awesome shaders and filters too, while running as fluid as possible maxed out on WIN7 professional 64, a dual core E8200, 4 gig of ram and the GTX 460 overclocked).\n\nBelievable cast and good voice-acting (the original actors are back! well, most of them, the most important ones at least. the voice-doubles like the one for Ash are doing a good job too)... what else to say?\n\nI spent 25 hours to complete the main-game, the two DLC's "LAST SURVIVOR" and "CREW EXPANDABLE" are very short both, but excellently crafted too. Time to visit the Nostromo. I won't spoil it for you, but you get what i mean, when you play it. :)\n\nI could write pages about what this game does right, but to keep it simple i'll put it like this:\n\nGame of the Year. At least. My favorite Game right now. Thank you CA! <3","October 11, 2014","true","52.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Read the PC Gamer review -- it's on the money.\n\nAlien: Isolation is an amazing game, and currently my personal choice for Game Of The Year, but it won't be everyone's cup of tea.\n\nThe game looks great, and the game design holds up very well for the duration of the game, never once becoming stale or losing its edge. You will be on edge for the entire 20+ hours of the campaign, so if you're an anxiety sufferer you should probably avoid Alien: Isolation like the plague.\n\nI don't want to give anything plot-wise away, so suffice it to say the story is fantastic. Its themes of fear of the unknown and corporate greed are both consistent with and resonate strongly with both Alien and Aliens. I've already played through the campaign TWICE and I'm now starting a third play-through on the hardest difficulty. Given it's rare for me to finish a game even once, let alone several times, that should speak volumes as to the quality of this game.\n\nAs I mentioned, though, not every type of gamer will get everything out of this game that I did. Those who dislike or don't have the patience for a slow, methodical pace should probably skip this -- as they should skip the original Alien movie. There is combat in the game, but it's not the game's primary focus and that shows. It makes perfect sense in the context of the game, but for anyone looking for a Halo or CoD level of shooter gameplay, they should look elsewhere -- this is not the game they're looking for.\n\nIf you can give yourself to the tension and live in the moment in which Alien: Isolation wants you to live, you will have an amazing experience. If you can't or if this much tension, fear and anxiety it's too much for you, I suspect you'll hate it.","October 12, 2014","true","269.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seeing another Alien game from SEGA had me...concerned, but as I said, this one is very well done.\n\nThe first hour or so is a little boring aside from maybe building up the tension. Once the Alien is introduced, that gets turned on its head.\n\nThe Alien AI was quite impressive though it did tend to follow a routine after awhile. Needless to say, I was still on the edge of my seat whenever it was in the level with me. Once the player receives the flamethrower I felt that the tension of hiding from the alien degraded a little (though I assume the amount of fuel pick-ups you'll receive is dependent on the difficulty).\n\nI will say this: certain enemies added later in the main story were frustrating if you did not have the proper 'tools' or anticipate their arrival.\n\nThe environment is fantastic, a lot of attention to detail when it came to this. Being a big fan of the first Alien film really brought out a great deal of happiness as I was exploring Sevastopol.\n\nHad fun playing it and I'll likely give it another go.\n9/10 (Because of my bias and my love of the Alien film).\n\n\nDLC's\nCould have been better and were rather short but I got em' for free so...eh.","October 11, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Inspiration has been taken from BioShock and Dishonored. Creative Assembly confirmed in their "Origin" video that only a single Xenomorph will be present for all of the game, which would focus on survival horror with a slower pace rather than the frantic action seen in other Alien games such as Aliens: Colonial Marines (2013) and Aliens vs. Predator (2010). However, the player will also spend some time shooting several types of enemies which are planned to include clones and soldiers. Vents, lockers, and melee weapons will factor into the gameplay.[1] The U.K. gameplay trailer for the U.K. version of the PlayStation official magazine, it is stated that any damage taken from the Alien would be instant death, thus the player would have to avoid and hide from the Alien.\n\nThe game will not feature any multiplayer whatsoever, according to Chris Napper.","October 7, 2014","true","43.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The storyline takes off with Ripley's daughter, Amanda, who hopes to find some closure after her mother's disappearance on the Nostromo. Every single inch of this gaming experience is a love letter to Ridley Scott's Alien. This extremely immersive experience will have you both paranoid and filled with adrenaline whilst you're being hunted. Not only does this game show how adaptive the xenomorph is, but it keeps you constantly on edge since you won't feel safe anywhere.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone willing to survive against the iconic xenomorph and Seegson's not-so-ethically-programmed androids.","October 13, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While some complain about the game being too long, too repetative, too tedius, and too challenging, I found Alien: Isolation to be a comfortable balance between the story, the objectives, and the enemies along the way.\n\nThe Alien is, for the most part, unscripted and will look for you throughout the world using only his programmed scenes (those being mainly sight, sound, and memory). Upon spotting something, it will go investigate. Upon hearing something, it will go to investigate. If it hears or sees  something that turned out to be nothing before (ie you tricked it with a flare or noisemaker in the past) it will remember that and realize that you obviously aren't there and are somewhere else. The Alien is unpredictable and can (admittedly) feel like it pops up out of nowhere. In reality, whenever the alien is actively hunting you, it always physically moves through the worldspace (meaning it never "Teleports" from one room to the next).\n\nAll in all the Alien, even on Hard difficulty, is overall extremely fair to the player. I never once died because the Alien "cheated", I died because of mistakes I personally made which I later corrected when trying again. Was I ever frustraited? Of course. Dying in a game is frustraiting but there is always a way past the Alien so it never felt like I was pitted in a dead-end situation. You just have to learn how the Alien moves and what its habits are. (btw the Alien's habits will change depending upon your progression through the storyline and how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off it is at you)\n\nThis brings me to my next point. Alien: Isolation is a trial and error game. Let's face it, if we were pited up against a creature like the xenomorph, we would die. The same goes for Amanda in our feeble hands. This game requires practice and patience in order to get past the Alien becuase it's a smart son-of-a-♥♥♥♥♥, it wants to kill you, and it's got some tricks up its sleeve to make that happen. Personally, I was fine with this trial and error approach but that's also because I enjoy games like Demon/Dark Souls that require me to try different tactics to defeat different areas. If those games aren't your style, that Alien Isolatio may not be for you (at least not on Hard difficulty).\n\nHonestly, the most annoying part of the game was dealing with Humans and Androids. The Humans were annoying because they were downright stupid. For as much inteligence as the Alien has, the humans have basically no street smarts whatsoever. There were many times where the Alien was in the room hunting and a human would see me and start fireing at me, even though it knew the Alien was in the room (because the Alien had eaten his entire group just moments before). Moments like this can admittedly take away from the game but in the grand scheme of things Humans don't matter much as a single noisemaker will usually clear out the whole room, leaving just you and the Alien.\n\nAndroids, on the other hand, are a nuisance for a different reason. The Alien doesn't care at all about the Androids and will always leave them be. The same, of coures goes for the Androids. Since neither creature cares about the other, you effectively have two types of creatures hunting you at the same time. The Alien, which kills you upon sight, and the Androids, which walk towards you in that unbreakable stride of theirs, make noise, and either kill you or lead the Alien to you. There did come a point in the game where I was more fearful of the Androids than the Alien because I could drive off the Alien momentarily but the Androids will keep coming no matter what you do. They are some hardcore Mother-♥♥♥♥ers.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, I felt that everything progressed logically and was overall balanced. While there is some backtracking throughout the station, I never felt like my backtracking was pointless. There was always a logical reason to backtrack through old parts of the ship that made sense with how the storyline was progressing. To be fair, Alien Isolation is a LONG game. But at the same time, there was never a point where I thought that the game should've ended already. As the story progresses and different things happen, new problems arise and so it obviously is rather difficult and challenging to get off of a space station that is infested with things that want to kill you. I thought the end to the game was wonderful and came at a perfect time.\n\nOverall I think this game is a crowning acchievement for the Alien genre and it should be on the top of the list for anyone looking to play a good Alien game. This game provides some excellent scares and excells at stressing you out while playing (in a good way). While it can be frustrating to die over and over again, the game does provide you with a means to learn from your mistakes and outsmart the Alien. I would highly recommend this game to everyone who desires some amount of a challenge and wants the purest Alien game on the market.","October 13, 2014","true","44.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
