You avenge your daddy.\nThis game is short, but really awesome! Reach your car by shooting your way to it. Watch out for the walking/flying bird though, they can kill you too!\nIt's an easy game, it's almost impossible to die, but also almost impossible to finish a level without getting any damage.\nAfter some levels, you get a mini-boss, well... mini isn't the best word, I'd prefer HUGE boss. You'll get the joke when you play it.\n\nI would call it an AAA-game, but since that a cheap game like this one can't be AAA, I'll just call it a AA-game. It's only 2,99 euros and completely worth it.\n\nKilling birds is the only thing you have to do. After each level, you go shopping with the money you got for selling the dead birds. You start off with a simple hunting rifle and near the end of the game, you become invincible with your hunting minigun, that's right, a freakin' minigun. It's gets even better! There is no reload and infinite ammo!\n\nThis game is great for when you got bored playing your 'daily'-game and need some relaxation. Personally I had a lot of fun in this game, too bad it will only take you around 1-1.5 hours to finish.\n\n\nPros\n- Kill birds!\n- Awesome weapons\n- Funny aspects (like the bosses)\n- mini-games\n\nCons\n- Game is too short\n- Almost impossible to die\n- Bad story-line (don't judge)\n\n\nRating\n7/10\nwould play again.\n\nRecommended?\nYes, I recommend it. It's cheap and it makes you smile. Eventhough it's small, it's fun. Tips for the developers: Make an 'endless'-mode, just as it says: Running endlessly until you die, with maybe a leaderboard.","November 13, 2014","true","1.0"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

Does it have great graphics... no. Does it have interesting and dynamic gameplay... no. Does it have a good story... no. So why in the hell is it good then? Because it is just a ♥♥♥♥ing good time i guess. The games story is as simple as they come, a bird killed your dad, so you kill all the birds. The gameplay is just holding down the left mouse button and shooting everything that moves. You do this while moving to the right(usually at a slow rate) to get to the end of the level. Towards the middle there's usually a bonus stage. The bonus stages are either collect tons of coins, shoot tons of birds, or my least favorite shoot like 5-6 cans. At the end there's either 1 of three things, drive away and the stage ends, run from the birds who jacked your car, or beat a big ♥♥♥ chicken. Throughout the levels, you can go to the store to buy different upgrades, such as better guns, more health, etc. Did i mention the whole game is ♥♥♥♥ing funny as hell? The main character is a redneck, and a lot times when he kills something he says something about the enemy killed. My favorite being when he kills the bomber chicken and says"i think that one was a terrorist". And that's it, beating the games took me about 20 min. The game probably sounds like a massive cluster ♥♥♥♥ and that's because it is. I played this game a second time just because i enjoyed it so much. Overall i feel like this game is a ton of fun, and brings me back to when i used to play a ♥♥♥♥ ton of flash games. Do i recommend you give this a try? YES its fun, it's cheap, and killed about an hour of my time. Overall i would give this game a solid 6/10 based on price, and the general amount of fun i had.\n\n~Hobo With A Shotgun(Agent 13) IM OUTTA HERE","June 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

All the birds in the area want to kill you now. This is a pretty short arcade shooter with not a lot of depth. I beat the entire campaign in an hour (albeit on the easy difficulty level).

Kill every bird you see but will you want to play this game ? In Bird Assassin we play as a redneck. One day our Pa is killed off by an Ostrich and its up to us to avenge the death of you're pa by killing all the birds. So how is this game ? It's actually really fun and for the price its also a really fun and a difficult game. The game is a 2D platformer where you scroll along the level killing birds and jumping on platforms to avoid bushes and bear traps. Overall the game is fairly simple and all the levels are the same but they get harder as they go on. There are a few problems with the game. The game is fairly short it only took me an hour to beat and its quite easy to get the best gun in the game and you can blast through the other levels easily. But for the asking price its definetly worth it and i really suggest you check this game out. I give Bird Assassin a 7.5/10","March 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game is fun...for awhile. Its a budget title, but one in the worst way. Not only is it repetitive but it also overstays its welcome. The game has only nine levels, which in itself isn’t a bad thing, but it its worse with the repetition. Its just not the fun kind of repetition. Shooting through swaths of birds with a mini gun is actually made BORING in this title, even with unlimited ammo because of all the dense clouds of unending birds and max gun upgrades. You have to take your time cutting through and at times, there’s so much happening above and below that you can’t help but die.\n\nAlso they reuse the same boss three times without changing up anything about it. Long story short, pick it up on sale only if you must, do not pay full price.","November 27, 2014","false","2.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
