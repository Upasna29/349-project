From the sound design to the gameplay, this is 100% a great game.\n\nIndie Devs take note.  THIS is how you do pixel art.","March 17","true","3.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The pixel art graghics are very pretty, colorful and well done. The music and story narrator sound great and really get you immersed in the game. You have a family of characters to play as each with different set of attacks.\n\nI had a lot of fun with what I played so far so I totally recommend this game to all rogue like pixel art fans and everyone else.","March 17","true","3.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Children of Morta is basically still in an alpha state with only 3 characters playable, but I already love it. The art is lovely, the design of the characters and monsters interesting, the gameplay is rather smooth and easy to get accustomed to. If you have played games like Diablo, then you wouldn't have much of a problem getting into Children of Morta.\n\nMost importantly, this game has a lot of heart. Every time you go home, you'll see the family going about their business, each one doing something that is a perfect representation of the character and their "class". I look forward to see what else the devs have in store for the game and hopefully, they don't disappoint. If all goes well, this might even become one of the newer Kickstarter success stories.\n\n\n*This review is subject to change as development continues and more of the game comes out until it's final release.","March 19","true","0.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I've run into maybe one bug and some minor nitpicks, but for the most part the game plays buttery smooth, each of the three currently available characters plays quite differently, and despite nominally completing the current content (there's more than just going through the caves and beating the boss, there's at least one quest that persists over multiple runs), I still haven't found everything there is to be found, and some of the things I've run into I haven't figured out. Game is fun and I look forward to more!","March 18","true","6.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The screenshots do not accurately convey how beautiful this game is, simply because they are not animated. You have to see it in motion to truly appreciate how smooth it is, and even at that, you are missing out on the music and the phenomenal narration. All that the guys at Dead Mage need to do in order for this to be a great game is to make sure the rest of the game measures up to the quality of what has been included in the present build.\n\nI have been eagerly awaiting this game for quite a while now, and I feel fortunate to be playing it in its very early stages. I will not say that this is THE most beautiful artwork that I have ever seen in a game (this title goes to Vanillaware), but Dead Mage has the best pixel art and animation that I can ever recall seeing in a game. Don't be fooled by my low play time; there is presently only one dungeon, and I'm pacing myself here for new content. I was able to test out all three characters and clear the one dungeon with my favorite one, Linda. The difficulty is very appropriate as it stands now, and things are well-balanced with her and her brother (but poor John isn't as fun to play as currently). I'm very much looking forward to the next update!","April 16","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The animation in this game is so good that it bascially makes all other games worse by comparison.  And the best part?  It's as fun to play as it is to look at.  This game does NOT dissapoint.  It's fun to play, it's fun to listen to, and it's fun to watch.  Buy it as soon as you get the chance and I gurantee you won't be dissapointed.\n\nA more detailed video preview if you're not already won over:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvhEGFLb2k4&feature=youtu.be","March 28","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
