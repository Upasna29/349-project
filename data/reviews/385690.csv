Supposedly the music was changed as well but i listen to my personal music while playing puzzle games so I don't know. If anything, this update made it a pretty much flawless puzzle game.\n\noriginal:\n\nOkay. I want to start out by saying I read the negative review which was basically the only review for this game and it will probably still be at the top for a while, and that deterred me from picking this game up. But i finally cracked because I absolutey love puzzle games and this one is no exception.\n\nThe pause menu is a little...awkward, to say the least, however after about ten seconds of clicking or looking at it you will know what all the buttons do. To save time: top left - restart, bottom left - return to menu, bottom right - next level ( I think it only works if you just beat this level but I haven't tried it in another situation.)\n\nOk. That's literally my only negative. There might be something later on and I'll be sure to update ASAP if i come across it however I wanted to point out that this game is pretty decent and definitely worth your time if you love puzzles, as a sort of counter to the negative review which might deter other gamers too","October 10, 2015","true","8.0"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","28","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/385690/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Wave Mechanics is a puzzle game made by independent developer Adam Tarnowski who thought of a new way to melt your brain for two euros.\n\nIf you've already checked the screenshots, you can see it's about grids, numbers and colors. But that's not a Minesweeper or Picross, it's something new! The gameplay revolves around swapping colors between the squares to get the required color scheme.\n\nIt's easy to learn but hard to master - after one third of the game the difficulty gets higher. Since you can't fully rely on your instinct (you'll be making mistakes pretty often), the developer implemented an undo button. That'll save you many times, keeping you in flow instead of making angry and frustrated.\n\nThere are totally 49 levels (procedurally generated) divided into 7 chapters - each chapter makes the game harder, with more specific requirement to the state of the grid. The graphic style is minimalistic and in combination with relaxing sounds and music this game is a great casual puzzler with a low price tag. If you are into puzzle games, you'll enjoy this for sure!\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 4","true","0.9"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

Your goal colors are indicated by the colors of the frame, you color rectangular areas solid using logic. There are 49 puzzles in all, and doing the first 19 took me about an hour.\n\nThe annoyances:\nno options: well, you can choose resolution and windowed/fullscreen when you launch, but the elevator music stays on\nno undo, if you misclick, restart the level\nall puzzles locked except for one\nno endless mode, apparently\nno goal number of moves, that means either you can only solve these one way only, or the game simply doesn't care. Either way, there's no incentive to optimize your solutions.\nFor a free flash game, that would be forgivable, but having paid money, I expect at least basic options and undo.\n\nI got more value out of Sigils of Elohim, and that was free. If you want unlimited puzzles (and a user-made editor), get Hexcells Unlimited instead.","August 3, 2015","false","1.1"," 33 of 51 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","33","51","3","0"

The procedurally-generated puzzles are presumably all possible to solve, but they lack a certain "elegance" to them that hand-designed puzzles would have. There were a lot of puzzles near the end where the solution involved outright burning moves or continuously selecting the same direction with a 4 or 5 line of squares, as well as making some moves that felt really counterproductive. A lot of the puzzles lack "forced moves" after a certain point which leaves you having to do a lot of trial-and-error to figure out what works and what doesn't.\n\nI like that in general you can micromanage different sections of the board and if you solve one section of the board it's very likely that's the only way to solve it, and the puzzle concept is definitely a good one, though it does feel like it gets a bit repetitive by the end, even with only 49 puzzles. But ehh, it's still a good game, just not one I imagine I'll return to.","December 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

This one starts out moderate, but near the end, I found myself drawing countless diagrams and staring at the screen for hours on end trying to figure out how to flip that last stubborn square.","January 6","true","42.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Certainly not simple enough to breeze through all of the levels in one sitting. Based on the time spent playing, I definitely got my money's worth. There's just enough frustration to make it challenging and worthwhile.","December 15, 2015","true","8.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Simple objective: turn all the colors to either blue or orange. You can turn the colors of the tiles using Numbered tiles at any direction. The tiles' number indicate the number of tiles' whose colors will be turned (ie orange to blue, blue to orange).\n\nYou start off easy.. and slowly you'll see that you probably need to crank your brain up a gear or two to solve the later levels.\n\nI like it. :)","April 24","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
