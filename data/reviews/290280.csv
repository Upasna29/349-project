It's definitely not the best game i've played this year, or even this month for that matter, but for the price of six dollars (or your regional equivalent), I think it's a wonderful deal.  While the story isn't really important to a game like this, the gameplay is, and in my opinion the gameplay is very good in Volt.  The game works in a physics based way.  You move by attaching beams of electricity to your surroundings, and letting gravity do the rest.  I personally do not typically like it when games do this, but I feel like Volt did it very well.  The difficulty is also right.  At the time of writing this review, I am on the 16th stage of level 1, and the difficulty is already starting to become noticable.  It will probably take someone quite a few attempts on each level to be able to beat the game.  Also, the puzzles are not really explained to you.  This may deter some people, but I think that it allows players to figure out many different ways to solve puzzles.  The music is pretty good. It seems to fit the gameplay very well, but it doesn't really add a whole lot to the package.  The art, however, is very good.  The colors that were used really manage to pull off the industrial theme, and they add emphasis to important things by making those things stick out with brighter colors.  The controls are not as good as I would like them to be though.  The game works completely with the mouse.  To break the beams, you hold the lmb and drag it.  This seems kind of finicky to me, because sometimes it seems to cut the wrong beam, or both beams.  The rest of the controls seem to work just fine.  Overall, I would say that Volt is a very good game, that is worth the price that they are asking for it.","April 14, 2014","true","1.2"," 77 of 91 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","77","91","4","0"

So you can believe me when I tell you it's tough. Really tough. The difficulty is fairly reasonable in the first zone, but from the second zone onwards, your patience is going to be tested a lot. So if you're easily frustrated, skip the rest of this review and go find another game, because you're going to pull your hair out until you're hairless in every zone of your body. Hell, you might pull someone else's hair out too.\n\nBut anyway, first things first: the gameplay. The main concept of Volt is fairly simple: you're a battery, and your goal is to escape from a factory, so you can live in freedom rather than being destroyed. This is easier said than done, however, because you can't walk. All you can do is swing (using a limited supply of electricity beams) and jump (using a very limited supply of energy). Some variations and complications are introduced in the game, but most of the time, you're going to be swinging through a level and solving platforming puzzles. And I must say it mostly works quite well. The swinging and puzzle-solving is entertaining, it is implemented in a variety of ways to avoid being repetitive (across different levels at least), and it has some nice highlights in it. The boss fights, for example, are well done and pretty memorable.\n\nBut the gameplay isn't Volt's only strong point. In fact, if you ask me, it is not even its strongest point: that prize goes to its atmosphere. It probably doesn't suit everyone's taste, but I really like the minimalistic, high-contrast industrial environments, and I really like the music as well. It varies between ambient and minimalistic techno or trance (whatever you wish to call it), which fits the visual design of the levels really well and sets the right tone for the game. I personally preferred the more energetic music from zone 3 onwards (as it makes for a more uplifting atmosphere), but the ambient was pretty great as well.\n\nUnfortunately, however, even though Volt is, in my view, a good game, it is far from perfect. Most crucially, it can become very frustrating at times. The levels have no checkpoints, and they are pretty long (in comparison to Super Meat Boy, say), so there are plenty of levels you're going to have to spend a long time in before finally beating them (over half an hour). Add to that imprecise controls (as is to be expected given the physics-based gameplay, but better design might have alleviated the frustrations a bit) and some questionable level design (a puzzle on the end of a difficult long level, where you will inevitably die a couple of times), and the result is that unless you're some kind of Buddha, you're going to cry in agony multiple times.\n\nAll in all, I do recommend Volt to some gamers, but I certainly don't recommend it to everyone. If the main concept appeals to you, if the atmosphere suits your sentiments and if you like a challenge, you could do worse than buying Volt. It's very cheap, after all, and it offers about 15 hours of gameplay (although it must be noted that you're going to be stuck in the same levels a lot of the time, making the game pretty repetitive at times). If you're easily frustrated, however, you should avoid this game at all costs. 7/10","June 25, 2014","true","18.1"," 67 of 76 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","67","76","12","0"

You may be one of the rare people meant to play Volt. The object of Volt is to get a robotic head with twin rope cannons from the start into a black hole of an exit square.\n\nYes yes, calm down. Dual rope cannons do sound cool. Volt (your robot, not the game), can shoot out two grappling hooks within a certain radius that appears on your screen as a beautiful glowing blue hue. To deploy a grappling hook, just left click your mouse on a wall, ceiling or floor. The only problem is Volt can't climb, it can just hang on. If you need to shorten the rope, you need to figure out a way to make it shorter. Things like making a second rope and then cutting the first one to swing on the second and making a new first rope at the apex of your swing.\n\nTo cut the rope, you need to hold the left mouse button and drag a line across the tether  that you want severed. That too is pretty easy. Its just the timing, cutting, precision, aim and momentum that become the issue. I'm sure it works great on an touch screen, but not with a mouse. Even something as cool as swinging on ropes has turned into an awful process.\n\nVolt is legless, so you are unable to move left, or right. You can't control your swing either. To make volt move you need momentum from one rope to the next like Spiderman with no legs or tumble down a slope. Right mouse clicking will make Volt jump if its on a solid object like a floor or a wall. If Volt is flat on the floor and he jumps it will hit the ground and randomly move one way or the other. It is imprecise and inconsistent. If Volt is hanging from a rope and next to the wall, the right click makes it push off a bit. I've gotta say this control scheme is awful for the levels that you play in. These levels need a lot of perfect timing and luck.  Your hook shots are limited and you can touch certain spheres for more ammunition. So if you run out, you're stuck and need to hit escape to restart the level or go back to the menu.\n\nThe game consists of four zones, each with 15 - 20 levels and the last having only 6. The first four out of 60+ levels start out fine and introduce the mechanics. Cutting the rope, swinging and cutting, jumping, tumbling your robot head down a slope into an exit. They all have saw blades that aren't quite instant death. Volt (the robot) has four cells of energy. Some saw blades take two cells, others take one. The game even forces you to take a hit on a saw blade to make it to an exit to prove that you will survive.\n\nThen Volt (the game, not the robot) decides you've had life too easy and throws you quickly to the wolves. What makes these levels so bad? Just the mechanics and the fact you need to be so precise. Swinging through saw blades, avoiding moving saw blades. These eventually get to be long levels. I can't call them time consuming, because each attempt takes less than a minute, but it becomes a longer than necessary process. Every swing and incorrect timing will mean certain death.\n\nTo top that off, a lot of the levels feel cryptic. Not with where you go, but how you go there. For better or worse, there is no hand holding in this game. You need to figure out to shoot something that will disable a laser. To have one tether connected to a ceiling, then one to a moving platform below you and wait until the lower rope stretches so far that it breaks so you catapult upward.  This is all on you to figure these things out.\n\nSince there are so many things the game doesn't tell you, I do feel like I had plenty of ah ha moments. Some people may like that, but ending a level with a head scratcher doesn't feel like fun. It made me feel like I had to get through the level ten times before I could solve the puzzle at the end. In fact the whole game didn't seem fun or entertaining. Its just a tough, uphill challenge.\n\nThere are blue lines and yellow lines. Blue lines you can't hook through. So walls and ceilings get covered with blue lines. Then there are blue lines that Volt can go through, but not your lines. So if you're hanging from a moving platform that crosses through a blue line, your tether gets cut and you fall.\n\nYellow plates begin to cover walls, touching them will hurt Volt. These you can grapple onto, but it sends an energy charge down your line to Volt. If the charge touches your robot, not only does it hurt you, but it severs that line. Its a good sort of way to push your pace. Then there are yellow auras that reverse gravity. You gently hover up to the ceiling in the yellow aura. It slows down your momentum though. So even quick swinging into the aura, you'll slow down and get pulled upward. There are a few levels that require you to swing deep into these auras and hope to not hit saw blade walls. Not just going one direction, but then turning around back the other way. If you haven't guessed, you can't turn Volt around without the hook and momentum, but you can't hook onto saw blades.\n\nAt some point the game introduces boxes that need you to either momentum swing into them to knock them down or shooting them with your rope will make it disappear. In fact if your light rope touches a box, the box and rope disappear. Several times, I had swung into a box and poof there went the rope and I fell into a pit of saw blades. Then there are red boxes. Hitting them with your rope makes them explode and if you're close enough, Volt will fly the other direction.\n\nAll the plates, explosive boxes and moving platforms do make for some intriguing levels. I just wish that Volt controlled better and I didn't have to be so exact with my time. I wish there was an easy mode with less saw blades and less challenge. This isn't a game like Super Meat Boy where I still have fun dying dozens of times in an hour, I feel every death in Volt. I feel the brief one second reload time as I need to methodically go through the precise process just to make it back to where I had died. Knowing that its not always skill, but a bit of luck that will get me back there.\n\nThe game has a nice atmosphere, with black silhouettes and glowing colors. It looks like a game I want to play. I just wish that the controls were better. I think its the visuals that really kept me in the game to suffer as long as I did. Since Volt can get frustratingly difficult far too soon, the developers made a good choice on the mellow music in the background.\n\nYou need to complete one level to unlock the next. Forcing you to play every level. There are par times that give you 'a' rankings. It seems like there are a few collectables here and there and four unlockable characters. None of which I've unlocked and I can only hope they control better, because they can't be worse.\n\nIf you are a hardcore gamer that needs a steep challenge, this game is for you.  For anyone else that needs to swing on ropes to have fun, try out Bionic Commando or even Cut the Rope. Sure one is a 2D shooter and the other is a casual game, but they are both far more fun than this. Who am I to say what your fun is?","February 17, 2015","false","3.1"," 77 of 99 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","77","99","10","8"

Volt is easiest (and I haven't the energy to write a lengthy description so easy is what you get) described as Cut the Rope as a platformer. As a little robot, you shoot electric strands out like a robotic Spiderman, swinging around level using only your momentum as you attempt to float into the warp holes placed in the most difficult to reach places.\n\nIf you've never played Cut the Rope, the key mechanic is cutting, well, rope in order to drop candy into an Omnom's gaping mouth. Except in this instance it's not candy, but your character, and instead of clever momentum manipulation it's frustratingly precise obstacle dodging as far too many different hazards conjoin to make getting through a level of Volt something akin a root canal.\n\nVolt is challenging, to be sure, but it's the method of control which really makes it such a nightmare. Having to slice with a mouse with any degree of accuracy is far more difficult than it has any right to be, and the precision you're required to do so in to make it through a level is far beyond what you're capable of with the limited control you have over your battery character. And to be quite clear, this is within the first dozen levels of the game. You're given next to no time to learn how to use the terribly clumsy controls, and then sent on your way expected to be able to somehow survive a minefield you often can't see until you've already died within it.\n\nIt's horrendous design from top to bottom, and made me absolutely loath the hour or so I spent attempting to play the game. I don't even know why I found myself so angry, but maybe it's because all of Volt's issues seem like just a series of many slight missteps that could have easily been avoided, but instead produced an experience I couldn't wait to get out of.","October 6, 2014","false","1.3"," 46 of 61 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","46","61","5","0"

Basically, it's fancy Cut the Rope. You extend lazor grapple beams, and cut them by dragging scross the beams. Additionally, you can bounce off the group, which leads to some pretty fun fall-jump-swing-cut-swing portions.\n\nThe only thing that's really frustrated me so far is no explaination of new elements. There's a -short- tutorial explaining the basic rope mechanics and then nothing so even if you're doing well you'll run into something new you don't know how to work with, and usually you have to experiement a few times before figuring out how to deal with it.","April 14, 2014","true","1.6"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

Well, in that, Volt is neither short nor quite fit for naming it "casual". And I'd better read some books in my short-break, than enraging myself with another try to beat a level there.\n\nVolt is getting "mixed" ratings - on Steam and everywhere else. There are many negative reviews on this fine concept, and, alas, those negative reviews have solid ground for "not recommending" Volt to normal players. Sadly, but, with all obvious advantages Volt have, it is not quite rewarding game, unless you're a very hard-headed fan of over-the-head-difficult-puzzles, seeing the ultimate reward in solving yet-another-riddle.\n\nVolt starts very intriguing, presenting quite nonstandard hero - a battery in some technical mazes, which can move itself only by two beams, which works like net of Spiderman. You catch a moment, shoot or release a beam, taking acceleration of this shift to push yourself forward, to the "exit" door. And that goes on and on, the levels quickly getting more and more complex, you have limited amount of beams to make your way through, and you gotta be careful too, for there are very treacherous grounds everywhere... And further you go, the more obstacles you'll meet.\nAnd after some time you'll meet your top. The level which you can't beat even in hundred approaches. And there you're asking yourself - what am I doing here? What's the purpose of this lifeform to exist on Earth? And so on.\n\nAnd you don't find answers.\n\nTo summarize that topic, Volt - is a puzzle game using some basic laws of mechanics, with very decent layout and very sophisticated levels. But it does not have a fleur of great games like World of Goo or Limbo, it is much more tough than Cut-the-Rope and similar projects... It is pointlessly cryptic and hard for the majority of players.\n\nWith all that, it is adequately priced, so I set thumbs up button. If you catch it on some sale or in a bundle, do not hesitate to give it a shot. Maybe it was made right for you.\n\nMark 6.7/10. Interesting approach in puzzle games, with only one real downside - it is punishing much more than rewarding.

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Volt is one of those games that I was tentative on picking up when it came out, as it seemed kinda like another one of those "HAY GUIZ WERE HARD GEAM PLAE US" kinds of games (like Cloudberry Kingdom and Eryi's Action). Fortunately, the level design in this game is better than those games, although I sometimes found myself thinking I might actually have more fun with those two aforementioned games (I'll talk about this later in the review). The game bills itself as a puzzle-platformer, although it is more apt to say it's more of a "you got puzzle in my platformer!" as opposed to "you got platformer in my puzzle!" That's not to say that the game is completely devoid of puzzles; there are a fair few levels in the game that do require actual thought. One feature I would've liked to have seen would be to look the level over beforehand so that you would have no surprises going through the level, or in the case of a puzzle at the end of the level, you would have ample time to figure it out.\n\nThe controls are fairly simplistic; the mouse does everything. Left mouse button shoots your tether (you can shoot two) and right mouse button allows you to jump. Jumping takes a bar of health, of which you have four. To sever a tether, you click and drag a line over said tether; "much like one would in a tablet game," I had thought. It turns out that I was right; this game is a ported tablet/phone game. One thing I wish the game would have done on the control scheme would have implemented is a Portal-esque control scheme where LMB would fire/retract the left tether (you could even color-code it like Portal) and RMB would fire/retract the right tether. Also, jumping would quite naturally be space.\n\nSo, you may be asking: this sounds quite alright for a game. Why the thumbs down? I've gotta be honest; I just don't find the game fun. Yeah, it's hard and I do enjoy challenging games, but this game more often than not felt hard because of the control scheme. Even after five hours, the control scheme felt clunky and sometimes downright unresponsive. Perhaps it was just me being bad, but there were quite a few instances where it felt like the game just dropped my inputs. Also, severing the tethers with a line is inherently imprecise and quite often killed be because either the camera moved the line around or I cut a tether I didn't even mean to.\n\nA question a game designer friend asked me one time when I was talking about a game was along the lines of "are you playing a game to beat it or are you playing a game because you want to and are having fun?" For pretty much the entire game, my answer to that was the former, up until 2-18 where I instead opted to answer, "I'm not playing the game anymore." That was the stage that made me stop and realize how little fun I was actually having. Also, that's why I said I may have actually had more fun playing Cloudberry or Eryi's Action earlier; while those games are unfair by design, at least I'd be excited and having fun, however masochistic of fun it may be. I just stopped caring after a while with this game.\n\nThat's the tragic bit about this game, though: I liked the concept. I liked the idea, but the execution of said idea just wasn't any fun to me. You may feel different, and that's okay; I've never had the most popular of opinions.  However, I can't personally recommend this game on the gameplay alone. 4/10.\n\nStory: You are battery. Escape the plant. Yeah, not really worth talking about or even rating.\n\nGraphics: When you start the game, you are greeted with everybody's favorite Unity launcher, which gives you the option of changing resolutions and graphical fidelities from three presets. There really isn't any need for super precise control of graphical fidelity, since this game opts for more of a stylistic presentation as opposed to a technical presentation. The art style in this game is... alright, I guess? It's rather Puddle-esque, although Puddle had some thematic variation. Unfortunately, some portions of the foreground do get in the way of some levels. It never created that much of an issue for gameplay, but it's still annoying when you're hidden behind a foreground pipe. The graphics style never did much for me, but at least it's functional. 2/5.\n\nSound: Holy butts the music in this game is boring. It's some of the most uninspired techno I've heard in a while. Like seriously, the music in this game is not good at all. I ended up turning it off after a while, instead opting for other OSTs like Unreal Tournament's and Digital Devil Saga's. I had a better time after doing that. Because I ended up deciding that the music was so uninteresting that I had to turn it off, I'll give it a 1/5 for the sound portion.\n\nOverall scores are: 4/0/2/1; cumulative score of 3.5/10. I picked it up while it was on sale, so I don't feel like I've been ripped off or anything, but I do feel like I kinda wasted my time with this game. You may end up liking it, but I just can't personally recommend it.","June 26, 2014","false","5.4"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

Whenever I would beat a difficult level it wasn't because that was my best run it was because I got lucky. A game that requires perfect timing and precision has to have consistent rules, the physics are wonky sometimes and when your moving quickly your beam doesn’t always want to latch on to things. Also, new game mechanics are not explained at all or presented in a way that makes it easy to learn them through trial and error, they’re generally just thrown in at the middle of a level. All this just adds an extra layer of frustration onto an already frustrating game.

The problem was very soon detected: level design. The mechanics could be used to create interesting puzzles, but the result is much more inclined towards precision platforming instead. It's interesting how many potentially good games I've played that can be described similarly. Designing puzzles is definitely harder so it's tempting to make action games. But making action games is deceptively hard (as opposed to visibly hard, in the case of puzzles). So what happens is the player is there, hypnotized by some new mechanic, a contraption, an interesting set of rules, whatever, and he wants to explore it, to see what he can do with it. Instead what he gets is a series of tunnels filled with deadly traps that send you back to the beginning at every misstep, forcing him to just repeat the same movements that worked so far. Imagine the developer of Portal decides that every level will be filled with turrets and deadly pits, with the occasional use of portals to take down a turret.\n\nOf course, I'm dumbing everything down to puzzle X action for argument purposes. My point is that finding the best way to design levels for a novel mechanic is just that extra challenge people innovating did not need but totally do have.\n\nI hate writing these reviews. I realize how harsh I am as a critic. The thing is, I see a lot of potential, I love new things, and I really want these developers to succeed! not discourage them with harsh criticism. So I'm off to buy Hot Guns now. Looks like a cool game. Hopefully I'll recommend it :D","November 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the current gameplay and controls I could see this possibly working better with a touch screen monitor as it feels like this game was ported straight from the Google or Apple marketplace, and the teadium of using a mouse makes this more of a chore and less enjoyable. Overall the game has potential but the devs missed the mark on the action tag. What makes this game even more difficult is trying to utilize any quick reactions that are needed on occation, as the overall slow pace of the game and the drone music is putting me to sleep.\n\nThe ideas are good but not excuted correctly. I did also like the retro contemporary graphic design, though they do look like they were done by Puppy Games dev's. If are looking for 'action' I would highly recommend against this title. If you are looking for something similar, try a Drink Box Studio title or Puppy Games title that is 'action'.

Perhaps I suck at platformers, but this is unforgivingly hard, unenjoyable frustrating experience. Each and every error restarts you back to the beginning.\n\nThe concept is nice, but too much depends on your momentum, timing and simply guessing the right moment when you need to attach and jump. You have no control over how and where the jump will take you. In fact the only way you can make progress is if you did everything in the level perfectly, kept up your momentum by swinging just right, not too far, not too close, judged exactly when you need to detach, so you don't hit a chainsaw, slide down the wall, bounce off before you gain too more momentum, oh wait you need to attach now, nope too far. You don't know what's coming until you die and are forced to start over, but don't worry you'll be repeating these until you worked the magic in your fingers so you can aim in your sleep. Oh there's the exit.

All it is is cutting lines and reattaching them using momentum to get through the level. The game design is so horribly done. The cutting and grabbing works terribly with mouse and keyboard......clearly this was made for tablets. Then you can only use your cord in a small space, which makes no sense. There is no way to re-get momentum or to get higher up on your cord, which is also terribly done. Also to further make things as dumb as possible, you are given a limited number of ropes. That makese no sense. It's like saying "Mario you only get 20 jumps to beat this level" this leads to taking away all use of reflexes and intuition to get out of spots. The designers for no logical reason want you to finish the entire level in one run, so there are no checkpoints. So what the game boils down to is constantly repeating levels using terrible controls when precision is needed, to make sure you make no mistakes and making sure you can beat it in one run. Not only do you have to beat it in one run, which would be dumb enough in a regular platformer, but since this is all about momentum you have to do everything perfectly through the entire level and time everything. This boils down to a perfect speed run of every level or if you make one single mistake at the end of the level you have to redo it all. They screwed up every possible way in desgining this game. Oh well idiots will still rate it well because they love spending countless hours redoing levels, which is why super meat boy was so popular. Even the "jumping" you can do doesn't have any direction and isn't efficient or helpful in getting you anywhere. I can't believe the designers thought all of these were good ideas. Only redeemable features are the 20 cents ill get back from the trading cards and the background music. 3/10.","February 20, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","3"

It's like a winning bingo card of reasons never to buy a game.  The developers must have done extensive research on finding absolutely terrible aspects of the indy movement to come up with a rotten hunk of code that typifies all of them.   However, to their credit, even Unity couldn't stoop low enough to have their name on this one.\n\nRegardless, it's a poor example of the horrible retro 2D platformer/scroller genre.  There are too many of these games - this one brings nothing new to the table worth mentioning.  Artwork is clunky, gameplay is, well, typical of the ancient dead genre.    There are thousands of free, interesting games on Steam that are far superior to this.   Don't buy it, don't play it (well, if you've played a 2D platformer before, you already have played this, it's so derivative).   Indy devs, please, please stop with the 2D pixel scroller shovelware.

The basic concept is perfect for a hardcore platformer - you need to guide your battery through a maze of a facility, and you can't move your character directly - you can use a beam (a kind of electric grappling hook) and let gravity (or moving objects) move you, or you can launch yourself outward from the platform you're sitting on (or hanging next to). Add in the atmospheric visuals and sounds, try to forgive the horrible music, and then you only need two more components for a perfect experience.\nNumber one is the level design. I have to say it's surprisingly good - most levels challenge both your problem solving skills and your dexterity. My only gripe is some of the levels are too hard - with several opportunities to die easily, limited energy and limited beams, some simply take too many tries to get right. Otherwise, it's very good.\nNumber two is, as with any hardcore platformer, the controls. Control design is actually pretty good, and the patches brought a few welcome tweaks. It's all the more surprising to realise during the game that the controls are hideously non-responsive. When you're moving, there's a 20-30% (!!) chance that you fire a beam and nothing happens. Also when you jump, the actual direction of the jump often comes as a surprise. Now add that on top of the near-sadistic level design, and what do you get? Rage quits, mostly.\n\nI was thinking a lot whether to recommend this game. I'm a great fan of games like Eron, and Volt has the potential to be similarly spectacular. In the end, it gets a thumbs up because what's broken can be fixed. Dear devs, if you happen to read this, please take a few hours and find out why those fickle beams behave the way they do...\n","December 1, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being a masochist, I was interested. I like difficult games when the mechanics are fair.\n\nVolt isn't such a game. The mechanics are horrible. Your main character will sometimes not attach to platforms even if they are well in range, making you lose instantly. The issue, I think, is that if you move your mouse EVEN ONE PIXEL while clicking, the game will register this as a swipe (to cut a link), instead of a click. Unfortunately this makes the game quite unplayable on PCs.\n\nBut hey, I paid less than a dollar for it so you don't have to.","November 24, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
