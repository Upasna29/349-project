Terribly boring. Terribly designed. Arguably the worst horror game I've ever played (and that's saying something).  Its idea of scaring you is inverting the colors on the screen, playing a loud noise & showing random dead horses...not even joking. I can't believe I just spent an hour of my life playing through this trash. If you enjoy having a gun with a 10 second reload, having no checkpoints and dying in one hit to everything then by all means play it. The story makes no sense, you're thrown in random areas for the hell of it & it's just more frustrating than fun. The game itself is more disjointed than this review. I tend to find something good to say even for some of the worst games out there. This one, I can't think of a thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/293180/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf is a FPS horror game, coming from the indie developer, Microblast Games. It was the first of Microblast titles that I've tried and I'm more than positive that it's gonna be the last of their titles that I'll ever be playing. At this point, we are used to indie horror games with poor environment design, broken or nonexistent stories and grindy rendering but this game takes the badly done horror game concept to a new level.\n\nFrom the tedious scraps of unhinged narrative, I'll try to present a baseline for the story. In a somewhat western setting, we have an old and bitter hunter called Walden living alone near the Ravin Town. Supposedly, he's been to a shooting years ago and lost so much blood, that it was a miracle for him to be alive to begin with. After the incident, Walden locks himself into his cabin, never to interact with the people of Ravin Town for years. On a fateful day, he leaves the cabin and notices an unholy darkness cowering the area. He takes his gun and decides to investigate, only to discover the townsfolk to be butchered and the town itself in ruins. Thus, his journey to take revenge for people he has never interacted with begins.\n\nGraphics give you the feeling that this game should be hailing from 90s, not only 2 years ago. Objects are riddled with odd texture bugs and the environment design is tediously repetitive. Camera view is either too dark to see anything or all infested by blasting neon colors of blurry visuals as if Walden is in a bad LSD trip. There are no character animations in the cinematics; only close up recordings of character models in obscure positions, standing solid in really weird poses. They are quite spastic. I think the developer had no idea how to animate to begin with, so tried to sell this piece as an artistic choice.\n\nThere is no voice acting at all. You are presented bits of narrative in between chapters, and the narrative is not only riddled with grammatical errors: it is horridly bad and meaningless. No definitive storytelling, no cause-consequence relation, no logical dramatic arrangement. Only over dramatic statements with absurdly empty undertone thrown around.  The setting itself isn't consistently logical to begin with. You'll go through your village, a mountain highway, an abandoned ship (?), a dungeon (wtf???) and a cemetery without meaningful story arrangement for any of these places. And that ending... well, you gotta love last minute enforced plot hooks and this one takes the cake with those! I literally fell out of my chair laughing the minute I heard the name of the main villain.\n\nGame dynamic itself is so badly broken, with no tension build up necessary for proper horror at all. You stumble upon jump scares every 3 minutes - consisting of either obscurely rendered close ups of monsters or some graphic images in negatives. All of those jump scares come up with ear ♥♥♥♥ caliber sound effects though, which is straight annoying. You run around with a mini-map directing you towards the next mission and either grab keys or shoot at some nugatory monsters. Walden's gun is probably the most useless weapon in video game history, by the way. It is a rifle - which Walden carries like a pistol - that takes 8 seconds to load. This is somewhat alright if you are facing a single monster but it becomes hellishly useless when hordes of monsters are running after you in the following chapters. Considering you have no sprint option; you run around, fire and run around some more while you wait for the gun to reload and repeat. That is all you can actually do in this game.\n\nIs it scary? Nah, it's so bad that it kinda ends up being good. That's why I completed the game to begin with. I was amazed at every little thing that I've stumbled upon, getting curious how worse it could become by the end. Atmosphere-wise, the soundtrack is the only good thing about this game. Consider yourself buying a music CD for a dollar. So it's good purchase in the end.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 9","false","2.8"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","41","42","2","5"

It's not a good one. It's strange and the plot is awful but it doesn't cross the threshold of being atrocious... UNTIL THE FINAL THREE LEVELS.\n\nSee, the worst thing about this wreck is the gun. It fires one shot and then takes nine seconds to reload. NINE SECONDS. It takes sprinters only around a second more to run a hundred meters. That's right, in the time it takes you to load this monstrosity, an entire Olympic event will have begun and almost finished. Up until this final third of the game, the combat is restricted to set pieces but once the game starts introducing free-roaming enemies into the mix, enemies that take MORE THAN ONE SHOT TO KILL, you are reduced to strafing round the borders of the map, taking pot shots at the fifteen enemies you have corralled into a clustered, screeching mess. Welcome to the next five minutes of your life.\n\nIt repeatedly drove me to hateful thoughts.

The flames are coming from the town. Your first objective is to get to your basement, pick up your single rifle, grab some bullets and head across the bridge into town. You don't run or sprint. With your trusty lantern to light the way, you begin to cross the rickety old bridge. Halfway across, it breaks and you fall in the river. Undaunted that your neighbors are on fire, you trudge through the shallow water.\n\nWhen you get into town, its on fire. White ash flutters through the air. There is no one left alive. Bodies in the church are mutilated and charred. The cross at the end of the chapel is on fire. There is a key on a barrel with only one place that it leads. Trying to exit the front double doors of God's house gets them slammed in your face. After taking some time, you manage to get one of the doors open and head to the stable where you use the key to get inside. It is there that you find more gruesome bodies. Even worse than that, you find a black mare on the ground, severed in two. Its pink innards are still inside and that's when you're punched in the face with a horrifying vision. A shock runs down your spine at the startling jump of the vision. Something is in your head and it won't relent until you've dealt with the werewolf.\n\nYou head out of town, where you build a bonfire to make it through the night. That's when you're attacked by a giant snake. After shooting it in the face several times, you find that you've been bitten. The world begins to melt around you. The world gets hazy and you struggle to walk through a canyon guided by your map. At the end of the canyon is an extremely tall watchtower. Even in a daze, you walk up a winding staircase to the top where there is only more horrifying death. You find a hidden key to a gate on the ground. Then without hesitation, you find the quickest way down is to leap from the watchtower. With the snake venom running through your veins, you feel no pain or death. You just get up and head through the gate.\n\nThat's when you come face to face with the monstrous beast. Your vision goes red from snake venom. It all becomes so surreal. Everything has a blurry green echo as your vision ripples. You see black blades of grass before you see a towering black shadow looking over you. Its pointed ears and arms indicate that its what is in your head. There is no fur on this wolf, its a slick jet black like the charred bodies you had encountered.\n\nThe first reaction in your head as it charges toward you is to quickly put a bullet in it. The bullet barely stuns it. The beast drops to all fours as you slowly reload your gun. It charges at you still and you're lucky enough to put a second bullet into it destroying it in a black puff of smoke. Was it real or is it the venom messing with you? That won't be the last encounter with the werewolf as you stagger through another canyon.\n\nGoing over a wavy bridge, you come face to face with the werewolf a fifth time. There is no where to run, its just you and your rifle against an aggressive man beast. The other encounters were easier. Some go away in a puff of smoke after one mere bullet. This one is different. Even after you've taken it down, it remains in your head. When you walk through the puff of smoke you jump at a loud screech as the hazy green fog goes blue and the werewolf rises in your mind. Its only in your mind and it won't ever stop trying to scare you.\n\nI'll end the abridged story there, but in case you couldn't tell, Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf is a first person survival horror game. You won't just be struggling to keep your sanity, but you'll be fighting against tar black werewolves, spiders and the slow reload of your single shot rifle. If that wasn't enough of a struggle, your lantern barely lights up a room. Everything that is lit up has an unnatural plastic shine to it.\n\nThere is no run, no rebindable keys, no duck and a laughably pathetic jump. You've only got arrow keys, a reload, a mouse click to fire your gun and a right mouse click to zoom in slightly or to move objects. You can lift fallen logs off bodies, move chairs, read letters, pick up keys and ammo all with the right mouse button. There is no pause screen, but there is a menu with only the most basic of screen and graphical quality options. Sorely missing was a brightness adjustment, but I guess you always have your monitor.\n\nAfter a chapter is completed, you are sent back to the chapter select screen, which takes me out of the immersion. Another thing that really takes me out of the game are all of the invisible walls that surround areas. First around your cabin, even underneath of the bridge there are invisible walls guiding you. I had to hop over clutter that I felt like I should be able to simply walk over. Things like logs strewn on the floor. Even coming up from the basement forced me to jump out. Ladders force you to jump up rungs one by one.\n\nYou won't find much animation if any. Cut scenes are relegated to camera effects and you see your character paralyzed in a default pose. The werewolf spiders and snake are barely animated. Its serviceable, but its also glaring. Even the reload animation is just your gun floating from right to left without a hand on it.\n\nThe game has a surrealistic hazy effect throughout most of it. Not just being bit by the snake. There are all sorts of camera effects. Everything from seeing what the snake sees in a fish-eye lens to blurry vision. It really puts a unique twist on things and sets it apart from other first person Unity engine horror games. Because of the surrealistic color pallet and fog, even the simple countryside can become a nightmarish landscape full of dead trees and rigid grass.\n\nYou won't just be in the countryside, you'll explore an abandon ship next to an ancient web-filled prison fortress. After that, comes a graveyard full unseen spiders hidden in the tall grass. You'll be tormented mentally with jump scares of enemies falling straight on you. It all keeps you off kilter knowing that any second the game will just screech and throw another mind torturing jump scare at you.\n\nWalden has no health, so getting caught by a werewolf or bit by even the tiniest spider will kill him. Every death restarts you from the beginning of the chapter. There is no save, but the game keeps track of the chapters you've unlocked.\n\nThe music is surprisingly good and should be applauded. It feels like a real musician added his talents to this game. It was the only shining point of this game. The sound effects though were deafeningly loud for those jump scare moments that we all know and love. There are plenty of random jump scares when you least expect them because the werewolf has taken control of your mind.\n\nTo help guide you on your way there is a map if you hit the tab key. It shows you and your direction, but shows your next objective with a glowing area on the map. The only problem is sometimes I went well off the map.\n\nWhile I do think this is more of a game than other first person Unity engine horror experiences, I didn't enjoy Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf. Supposedly its an hour long game, that took me three hours to complete and it felt like mental torture every step of the way. With all that said, the surrealism and the awful gameplay make this one unique game among its peers. It has been 14 cents before and in many bundles. It might be worth it.","February 12, 2015","false","4.5"," 57 of 74 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","57","74","4","0"

The story is completely scattered and makes little sense. You're basically plopped into random environments to complete mindless tasks. These missions fail to advance any sort of plot or character development and the complete lack of voice acting and decent animation made it difficult to stay interested in the cut-scenes. The "horror" consists solely of pathetic, deafening jumpscares every several minutes or so and the encounters, which I assume were meant to be suspenseful, were made laughable by the ridiculous models and animations. As for the actual gameplay, it was just silly. All of the fights are extremely easy and dull, requiring hardly any attention at all. The boss fights are just as bad, as they're made up of running around in a circle firing away with a gun that takes way too long to reload. A lot of the monsters just end up bugging out as well. The only sort-of good thing about the game is the soundtrack, but even that could have been a lot better. Even with it's very low price of $0.99, added with the fact that coupons seem abundent, I still wouldn't recommend purchasing it.

And maybe slightly improve the game's ending. Was about to say "and combat"... but no, it's rather a little psichological challenge as it is(not too hard once you know how to act) and makes a significant part of what makes sense in this game.]\n\nHonestly, taking into account that it's a one dev's work, and, i presume, the first one of his, i'd like to give this game a thumbs up. But feels like it just wouldn't be right, and not recommending it is sure to save many players from dissapointment and the dev himself from offensive comments.\nThough i can recommend it to those who like getting themselves in some new surroundings to walk through another short and primitive story and have little care for how bad them both were thought out. You'd even find a little pretty scenery(if you like that kind of it), slightly scary for noobs visual and sound effects, nice music and maybe a couple of other good things. But it won't add enough to make the whole game damn good. Can't say i'm totally dissapointed but looks like screenshots and description on the steam store leave much better impression than the game itself. And everything i relatively liked in this game was getting heavily damaged all the way by the boring combat(which looks a little better if you view it as a check-up of your nerve and is easier that looks initially), and almost killed by the ending which was either(i'm sorry, mr developer) stupid or far beyond the limits of my ability to perceive why the hell it had to be ended that way, looking like a text description of a bad movie's promice to be continued(i'd even speculate that's what it is or once had to be).\nThere was a slight hope for an alternate course of the game story, (here goes a spoiler on a game story event): [spoiler]screaming woman, found dead in my playthrough[/spoiler]which i don't believe in and don't feel like gonna check it right away i finish typing this. Maybe later.\nTo say more good about the game - it doesn't take too much time to play through and has no bugs ... and is cheap enough now to fit its shortness and simplicity.","September 9, 2014","false","4.3"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","33","47","2","2"

I had to make a transaction to sell some uneeded stuff over the steam marketplace so I literally looked for the cheapest game that I thought I may could put up with one day and found Overcast - Walden and the werewolf for $0.14..\n\nOvercast - Walden and the werewolf is a physiological horror game that eats at you with the erie atmosphere not knowing when, where, or what may pop out.  In between every chapter you get cinematic cutscenes that fill in the story piece by piece.  The cutscenes have heroic music behind them and subtitles telling the story.  You have 9 chapters of story to complete which can be completely within a couple of hours at most.\n\nThis is a FPS.  In the left hand you have a lantern, the right you have your handy rifle.  You only get one gun.  One bullet and then you have to reload everytime.  Only a couple of keys to control the whole game while having the "hand" cursor the same as Penumbra or Amnesia games to grab and move objects around.\n\nWhile being a huge horror movie and game fan I adore this game for what it tries to do.  The graphics are dated and are not pretty as the games today but Overcast proves you can still scare the sh*t out of people without modern graphics.  Now for graphics this games graphics are pretty plain.  Very grainy style graphics that makes it hard to see anywhere far from you.  BUT.  I've seen people get scared and jump at a lot less than this.  But there are a couple of times in the game that I can imagine some people may get freaked out or even jump at.\n\nGameplay was pretty smooth for me but I did encounter a bug two times during the final boss fight that I guess kept the fight going and somehow I randomly died both times?  After one final attempt before shutting the game off for the night, randomly with me expecting more fight the game ended!\n\nThe combat in the game was very boring in my opinion.  It gives you a gun that has one shot, takes forever to reload and makes you back up - shoot - reload during every fight.  I can understand that this machinism is designed to implant fear or panic but in my case it just annoyed me to no end making things feel very drawn out.\n\nI was not a big fan of the story, but to me it was more of a game with a "base" story that thrown me in the game to play.  The heroic music in each cinematic cutscene made me feel like a badass and even in some combat the music gave me hope!\n\nBottom line:  For under a dollar if you are a horror fan looking for something to occupy your time for a couple hours, maybe give you a couple jump scares than pick this up.  I do recommend this game because besides the final fight I had no problems running or playing this game.  It has a story, it was in 3d, and could get a couple good jumps out of some people.  That is my $0.14 cents worth people :)","January 6","true","1.8"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

This game opens with a useless menu prompting you to click "game." That's right, "game." Once you open that it throws you to a level select where you can only pick the prolouge. The prolouge has admittedly a below average soundtrack that outshines EVERY other aspect of this game. The developers tried to use a Amnesia-esque grabbing and physics system, but it just simply feels wrong. Something about the objects feel like they are foam. The objectives are unclear to a point where the invisble walls guide you. Doors are opened by walking into them and not by any kind of grab, one point I think their grabbing system could've worked with since it doesn't require vertical movement. And worst of all, the flame animation. It's just terrible. This game is only good for gifting to your worst enemy and convincing them that it gets better in the end only to have them tear out their eyes in an attempt to get the terrible plato gun and lantern, with a smaller form of the flame animation found everywhere, out of the permanent indentation in their retina left by this terrible game. 2/10 at best. 3/10 if jumpscares are all you expect out of a modern horror game.","December 29, 2014","false","0.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","16","20","3","0"

A mysterious being left her a game containing a challenge. Who could that be? Thousands of questions passed through her mind, but she knew one thing.........THIS GAME ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS ♥♥♥"\n\nOvercast - Walden and the Werewolf is one of those games that are so legendary in their level of suckage, that I love playing them just to find out if they are as bad as people say. Let's begin with the positive points, shall we?\n\n+ The main menu music and slightly distorted sounding version of it playing in the game isn't really that bad, It's....passable.\n\n+ The game tells you were to go on the minimap, so you don't really have to think a lot to progress, it's right there, in the corner. Good.\n\nThat's it for the positive points! Now, the fun part! I firmly believe this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing insanity test.\n\n- Character models look stiff as ♥♥♥♥, I mean, for example, Walden holding the flashlight with his fingers spread, the ring of the lamp on his index finger, that's all. It even looks unrendered at parts, dunno if it's intentional, if not....Jeez. Also, the werewolf seems to lack lots of animations, and when you shoot him and he starts pouncing around like a happy puppy, it's hilarious, instead of scary.\n\n- FOG AND DARKNESS NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOOK. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE!\n\n- Not even 2 minutes into the game, i'm greeted with the first jumpscare. Boards falling out of nowhere, spooky scary boards.\n\n- Those flame graphics. Jeez, they are totally next generation, I've never seen something that gorgeous!\n\n- YOU JUMP UP THE ♥♥♥♥ING LADDERS. JUMPING!\n\n- The gun control is extremely weird, and sluggish as all hell. It takes almost 5 seconds to reload a single bullet. At least the werewolf dies in one shot....Or does he?!?!\n\n- Most of the jumpscares are either a scary JPEG. Image, or a ♥♥♥♥ing stiff rendering of some...Monster...Thing?\n\n- This game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥. I "killed" the werewolf (Where he is supposed to LEAVE THE ♥♥♥♥ING SCREEN!) but he still gets me.... It happened 4 times. Jesus, it even dissapears, WHY DOES IT STILL HIT ME!?!?\n\n- Moving is rather hard, aiming isn't that hard, but in the middle of a ♥♥♥♥ing mountain trail, I can't ♥♥♥♥ing see the were♥♥♥♥♥ with Walden's Drug-O'-Vision, what the ♥♥♥♥, yo. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing blurry that I have to look at the walls of my room just to make sure that I'm not suffering myopia. Also, there is gray....Magenta and cyan....I seriously feel high, and my eyes just can't take it. The worst part, it makes that werewolf part rather hard, which is a ♥♥♥♥ sucker, because...Beware....\n\n-....There are no checkpoints. I think I counted one, if so, and it was such an odd feeling. At least the "chapters" are short as ♥♥♥♥, but jeez, give me a break with that werewolf chase junkie vision...Whatever.\n\n- This game really needs a sprint button. Amnesia had it. Penumbra had it. Why doesn't this one have it?\n\n- Bosses are pretty much "Shoot, kite, reload in 5 seconds, shoot again, kite yet again, reload for 5 seconds again" over and over and over. I'm glad, though, because If i had to avoid projectiles, this would be a real ♥♥♥♥ sucker with these stiff as viagra controls.....Which brings me to the next point...\n\n-...The spider boss. I lost it at this point, seriously, I tried it, but it was just too painful to go on. Sure, it doesn't have projectiles, but tiny, fast spiders rush you and they kill you in one hit! Also, beware, because they can also hit you before they reach the ground. Thanks spiderwebs, you are the best.\n\n- This game is so short, that people seem to be able to beat it in 1 hour or so. That's why I wanted to beat it, because it didn't seem that bad or that long. I was wrong. The pain makes you feel like this game is 10 hours long.\n\n- In my short playthrough of this abomination, I counted 10 cheap jumpscares. 10! Ain't gonna tell you where or when, to avoid spoiling the surprise, I can just say that one was so ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Spooky scary monster appears in your face, while some sound file that seems to belong in a dubsteb song plays. WU-WU-WU-WU-WUUUUNNNNGGG.....I died laughing.\n\nIf you are looking for a serious scary game, look somewhere else. Spooky factor? 2/10 or so.\nIf you are really looking for crappy, jumpscare based games that seem to thrive nowadays, this game is up your alley, 10/10! More like up your ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥.\n\nIn short, I got this game as a gift, and I feel ripped off, I feel like I was scammed, and I feel like I hate gifts now. Say no to drugs, and no to this ♥♥♥♥ing game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5phl8p3euG4\n\n\n\n\n","February 18, 2015","false","2.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","17","22","12","1"

The music was really nice, it actually helped provide a creepy atmosphere for at least the first 3 or 4 levels, I don't know if it continued as I gave up upon seeing the werewolf for the first time and realizing that the gameplay doesn't improve in the slightest.\n\nNow for the bad. First point: Gameplay. I like a good story, but even more important is the gameplay, how you interact with the world and it's creatures. The gameplay here consists of move objects, fire one shot every ten seconds or so if you're in combat, strafe at a ridiculously slow pace against enemies that move slightly faster than you, and walk along a very linear path while enjoying acid flashbacks that will hurt your eyes.\n\nSecond point: The story. It's not that bad honestly, but it doesn't really make up for the terrible gameplay which is what I was hoping for. I can pull through a rubbish game if I enjoy the story it's telling me, or vice versa but here I got nothing. No voice acting, which was fine as it's clearly low budget and bad voice acting ruins games for me nearly every time. So you learn the story from the little subtitled bits that appear in between chapters. Not a problem here, I love subtitles as I often miss things without them. However, I do like it when things are spelled correctly and the overall story makes sense. The biggest sin is that it tells you things that just happened, or puts you in danger then solves the problem for you in the next sentence. Perhaps it improves as you go along.\n\nThird point: The visuals. No, I don't mean the graphics. I've been gaming since the late 90's, graphics are not what I look for in a game and here they're servicable. When you can see anything, that is. The game is so bloody dark I couldn't see more than 4 feet in front of me. This actually added a bit to the atmosphere, but at the cost of frustrating me to the point where I very nearly gave up on the prologue. Also, the acid flashbacks I mentioned earlier. They were just unpleasant, broke immersion, hurt my eyes, and actually made some of the jumpscares less effective.\n\nFourth point: Jumpscares. I'm a naturally nervous guy, I startle very easily. Thankfully the jumpscares here were weak enough to provide just the right amount of tension for the first few chapters. They come very often though, so it gets a bit repetitive. Nearly ♥♥♥♥ myself at the start of whatever chapter it is when you see the werewolf for the first time though.\n\nOverall, I bought it for 54 cents Canadian and got roughly half an hour of semi-enjoyment out of it. Not bad really, but I could've put the money to better use. If it's dirt cheap because it's on sale or you've got a coupon and some money to burn, go for it. Otherwise, just watch The Fragnostic's video for it. I got more entertainment from 5 minutes of his video than from playing this game.","March 25","false","0.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

It should be called "Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf, and a Snake for some reason". Plus, the storyline isn't even interesting, and the FPS gameplay is just plain dull.\n\nThe only reason I got this game(not through steam, if you get what I mean)was so I can get the soundtrack, because it is good.

Well, the stage were you have to run from the werewolf has actually improved, but everything else is just bad.\nInstead of a horror game I received a horrible first person shooter were you have to reload after every single shot.\nAnd the worst part is that most of the stages after the ones that were in the alpha consist of shooting.\nThere was a "run through corridors and kill some spioders"-stage or a "run in circles around a room and kill some spiders"-stage and a "run through a graveyard and kill spiders and skeletons"-stage and of course "defeat enemy hordes and die a couple of times"-stage.\n\nAnd despite the fact that the story is nearly non-existant the final stage seems to claim otherwise and actually throws a deus ex machina cliffhanger at you. Sorry, but I'm not interested in how the story pans out!

This game has tons of potential if this creator goes back to this to overhaul it.  I think presentation wise it is a good effort to tell a simple story that half of it is told by just looking at how it plays through with your experiences. I grew up in an age when video games were still a new concept and we didn't have fancy graphics or complex gameplay with our games. But they didn't need to be complex to have the user understand the concept of what is going on and how to operate the game.  Go ahead and try to play a coleco game or a intellivision game. You will see how simplistic games can be enjoyible.\n\nThe one thing I keep seeing about this game is its visuals . Whooptie big ballzy deal. Not all games are based on graphics. "Get that out of your head junior". Story wise I see complaints aswell.  Tbh I like short simple stories and this one told a story and got its point across. "Maybe junior you need to get more of your edumacation on the understanding of arts"\n\nFinally the music was well done for this.  Now sound effects wise some were ok but I will say don't play the game with headphones on at full blast.. Some of the noises will be so overwhelming and loud it will damage something.  I really would like to see this person make a sequel because the end sparked my interest with wanting more.  Or expand upon what is here and make it better and fuller with the rest of the story instead of starting over from scratch.","December 18, 2014","true","3.9"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","17","31","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chuulimta/recommended/293180/","Chuulimta","Beautiful Gurban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chuulimta/","1254 products in account","Since the dawn of man, all the way back in 1947 with the advent of the first video game, men have stared longingly into their monitors and asked "What if there's something more to games?". With a flood of video games in the 70s and 80s, many believed that Western gaming would be forever doomed by shovelware and cheap tie-in software. However, with the fall of the Ataris and Intellivisions came something out of the ashes - a metaphorical phoenix determined to set the world ablaze. Only now, over twenty years after the infamous Video Game Crash, can we finally be witness to the greatest game to ever grace mankind. Spoken of only in legends previously, it is now our greatest honour as a species to play the masterpiece that is "Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf".\n\nFirst I would like to discuss the release of this game. Being a long-known legend, it was not simply released to little acclaim one random brisk Friday in April 2014. Walden and the Werewolf was actually found recently by archaeologist in the same spot that the Library of Alexandria burned at. While rummaging through the dirt at the site, a lone individual uncovered a charred, ancient hard drive, with a capacity of only 693MB. After many years of toiling to get it to work with modern computational hardware, the files on the drive were accessed, with only one executable file on the disk. Reading "JogoHorrívelNaoJogar.exe" (Portuguese for Walden and the Werewolf), the researcher double clicked the exe file, only to be baffled at what showed up. As soon as the game launched, his eyes were unable to process the glory of what stood in front of him, and he collapsed then and there, only to be found dead by his colleagues hours later. Those same colleagues found nothing on his computer however, for Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf had finally broken free of its physical bonds, and would soon grace the world with its presence for all time. Appearing as nothing more than moving motes of dust on the wind, Walden and the Werewolf managed its way into Valve Headquarters in Bellevue, Washington. Shortly after, it entered Gabe Newell's personal computer, and uploaded itself to Steam without him being any the wiser. A few short minutes later, and Walden and the Werewolf was on the Steam store, listed as being developed and published by Microblast Games. Little did these developers know that this would be the most miraculous event of their video game producing lives, for surely their wallets would soon be unknowingly flowing with dozens, if not hundreds of Brazilian Reals as the masses purchased 'their' game.\n\nThere is good reason for why Walden and the Werewolf sports an 8.8/10 review by 'Desura' on its Steam page (any points lost must have had to do with the reviewer no longer wanting to live after completing the game, it's just that good!), and it has to do with how amazing the game itself is. On launch, the player will notice they have the option of not one, not two, but nine content-filled levels to choose from, though eight of them are locked away, requiring the player to complete the previous level before advancing. Should one be able to play any level from the get go, they would be too overwhelmed by the magnificence of the later levels to go on living any longer, and so the game slowly ramps up its glory bit by bit, so that the player can develop a sort of tolerance. The first level anyone will play is labelled "Prologus", which perfectly describes the challenges that lay before whoever is playing.\n\nUpon loading the first board, a faint outline of a house appears in front of the player, shrouded by a fog of static and fog. Approaching the house grants the player the opportunity to see some of the amazing graphics the game has to offer. While some may describe the aesthetic style of the game as "Play-Doh like" or "Awful to the Nth degree", I must say there is a certain j'est ne sais quoi to the rounded polygons which make up the environment around you. Falling into a trap, the player finds a bolt action rifle in the basement of the house, carried in the right hand from then on. Upstairs are 6 bullets which magically find their way back to you upon completing a stage. Leaving the house, the player finds a rope bridge, destined to bring them to salvation. The wavy nature of the ropes is all but a prophecy of things to come as the player plunges into the icy river below.\n\nI could bore you with details of how the later stages play out, but such brilliance must be seen to be believed. Countless ear-wrenching jump scares sure to spook the pants of off you, and stolen hand-crafted physics assets stand between you and completion of the greatest game of all time. Messages like "You got KEY" are sure to keep you tantalised for hours on end. Horses, puddles, and fences are sure to bring endless entertainment. Dark Soulsian bosses come about later, testing the endurance of the player as they circle-strafe for minutes at a time, only to perish in a single hit. Character models stuck in the T-pose and Hotline Miami-esque filters grace the player's eyes in cutscenes and gameplay, keeping the atmosphere fresh and alive. What's even better is the green-magenta stereoscopic imagery one will find as they progress which never goes away. Unfortunately I have never beaten Walden and the Werewolf, for I am a lesser man, unfit to complete such a masterpiece. However, I hope all of mankind can experience this wonderful work of art, and for a measly dollar you could almost certainly do better worse!\n\nOverall, it's alright. A bit boring. But then again so is this review.\n\n0/10","May 13, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This game isn't horrible, since I managed to play through it, but the problem is I found myself critsizing and laughing at everything this game threw at me. A horrible attempt at an FPS (I guess) horror, you play as Walden, who apparently is void of any sort of emotion and personality until the end. And it's weird since the game gives you his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story at the beginning and then decides to not build on it at all during the game. So then we have this Werewolf with magic powers destroying things and murdering Walden's entire village (That he didn't live at) for no reason, so Walden has to go find this werewolf, but first he has to do a bunch of things that also have no meaning to the story. Now I'm not going to outright spoil the game, but basically finding keys and killing giant animals (that have no apparent explained connection to the Werewolf) are the majority of objectives for the game. I'm not surprised this game goes on sale for such little prices regularly. I bought it for 19 cents, which I think is appropriate, maybe a bit too cheap, but when I made this review it is now on sale for 29 cents. In the end, this game is absolutely, positively not worth the normal $10 it is priced at. When it is on sale for it's usual less than a dollar price, feel free to buy it, I enjoyed laughing at the stupidity this game guarantees. 3/10 for unnecessary film grain","April 18, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCrazyCrambo/recommended/293180/","RealCrazyCrambo","EthanCrambo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RealCrazyCrambo/","1298 products in account","This review contains very few spoilers... I think. :P\n\nAlready from the first minute or two of playing this game, there have been a couple of jumpscares. These jumpscares are quite cheap - not screamers, fortunately - but in a sense, these scares are pretty effective for an early development game designer.\n\nThe graphics of the game are not very appealing, they are very... well just not very good. I have a strong feeling that this game was made using the Unity 3D Engine, due to the scenery. The scenery is also very cheap, but once again - this is a good start for a beginning game designer.\n\nI have noticed from the beginning cutscene, there is text dialogue to read at the bottom of the screen. In order to make the game better, I believe that if the creator was to get some voice actors to simply read that dialogue and put it into the game, it would already be so much more effective and intriguing. Perhaps a scratchy voice, considering the character is a hunter.\n\nIn addition, the cutscene doesn't contain any motion. It contains camera movement, but the characters in the cutscene are standing still and are not moving. Perhaps some rigging and animation could fix this and, once again, effectively make the game better.\n\nThe game reminds me a little of the Amnesia style. You can pick up and throw (kind of) objects around such as chairs and tables. A hand is shown in the center of the camera view when you look at an object that can be grabbed.\n\nThe title screen is simply a rifle spinning around in circles, however it still seems pretty effective. There is motion, at least, unlike other indie games' title screens.\n\nThe jumpscares mainly consist of visual effects and really loud, strange volume. This is quite effective - I almost headbutted my desk.\n\nThere are notes that can be picked up and read in the game. These are of good style and contain some good information to set the horrific scene of the game. Also, there is lots of blood and gore in this game, but the models used for the humans and the horse are not too exciting. They look like mannequins.\n\nThere is a map that shows you where to go, which is a decent addition to the game because you have something to show you what you are supposed to do and where you are supposed to go. The jumpscares still happen through the entire game and do make me jump out of my seat.\n\nThe creator has successfully used the right music to create tension and drama. Music is a very important thing in videogames, for without music there really is no build up in tension.\n\nEnemies in the game consist of very basic coding: they follow you and you die if they touch you. This makes the game incredibly easy as far as shooting the enemies, however extremely hard when enemies spawn in opposite locations around you, meaning that if you try to dodge one, another one will be near you and could possibly almost touch you. I actually found the last mission so hard that I was unable to complete it - it just seemed impossible to me. Of course it's not impossible, but after many tries, I had enough.\n\nI noticed something strange about the enemies' walking. Sometimes they would collide with an object on the floor or another enemy, which then made them make a swimming motion on the ground. That might need to be looked into.\n\nOverall, this game is not the best thing in the world but I would say that if you are the type of gamer that likes indie horror, you should definitely give this game a shot. It does have some potential. :)","February 21","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But i honestly would not recommend purchasing it. The scares are not scary if you have actually experienced horror games, they will honestly make you lol by the end. It's such a cheesy game that it's hilarious to play. I got it for 3.39$ on The Summer Sale and i'm grateful that's all i paid for the game. There's no voice acting whatsoever, all of the story is subtitles except a few screams. I beat the game in an hour and half just goes to show how short it is, and that's with multiple deaths of the boss encounters. Interesting concept, i'd like to see the game remade one day, the story has potential if someone made an awesome game and bought the rights but as of now.

It's yet another shoddy jump scare fest made with Unity by some kid who was hoping to get PewDiePie to make a video about it. There's nothing fun or scary about it, and I wasn't even startled by the jump scares.\n\nMost of your time spent playing this is spent looking around in the dark for keys and other small objects. Your lantern is so dim that you can barely see anything more than five feet in front of you, and you get stuck on everything. Even the smallest object can't be stepped over, so you might be looking around in a dark room and realize you can't move, then you look down and see a severed arm or some other small object that your brain insists you should be able to step over but you can't, so you either have to walk around it or painstakingly pick it up and throw it out of the way. It makes looking for keys in the dark even more tedious than it already is.\n\nThe graphics are terrible, and I guess whoever made this is aware because they tried to disguise it with a ridiculous grain filter which only makes things worse, as well as baffling light effects that only serve to obscure your vision. Every model that isn't either a tree or the ground has this this weird shininess that makes it look like an inflatable pool toy. I think the only thing that's actually animated is the werewolf, and even in the intro cutscene, the character models just stand still in a default pose while the keyframed camera slides around.\n\nThe first time you encounter the werewolf, you have to run up a hill while it chases you, and it teleports so you have to shoot at it to slow it down (and your gun is single shot and takes about four seconds to reload, so you can't afford to miss). It also kills you in one hit. While this is happening, the screen blurs and you get this two-toned double image with motion trails. Combine that with the excessive film grain, the fact that everything is dark, and the eye-searing overuse of the color red. You almost literally cannot see what you're doing during this sequence. and it doesn't make the game any scarier. It just makes it stressful and frustrating. I could swear it was designed to induce migraines. With this, the game goes from being boring and tedious to thoroughly unpleasant.\n\nI don't care if this game was made by one guy. It's so terrible that he has no business charging any amount of money for it, not even the 19 cents I payed during the winter sale. Nineteen cents is almost enough to buy a gumball, and that would have been a more worthwhile use of my money. I have played free games by one-man teams that were better.\n\nThis game isn't worth wasting your money on, nor is it worth your time. I promise, you had more fun reading this review than you will playing this game, and I'm not even exagerating.","January 3, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game feels like a student project more than anything else. The gameplay is clunky, the "horror" is entirely composed of sudden loud noises and bright flashes. The camera regularly shakes, sways, and the game intentionally skips frames to make it seem like the player is hallucinating. All this does is make horrible gameplay even worse.\n\nI can't believe a game this awful was ever approved for distribution on Steam.","January 7, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Really annoying.\n\nDark, grainy graphics could work in this kind of game. I'm okay with that. But too bad everything looks like shiny plastic, including wood, blood, plants etc.\n\nFirst try shortly: After finding a gun, green arrow on yard was calling me. But I wasn't allowed to go there when my weapon was not loaded. (Why there was green glowing arrow there then?) I drop down from bridge and continued walking in water, but after a moment I died. (Apparently I drowned, there just wasn't any indicator of that?)\n\nFor some reason game continued from other side of bridge even though I didn't reach it. Old locked wooden gate stopped me. Shooting it didn't make any damage. I walked out from the map and collided to invisible wall. When church doors slammed shut, I thought something is finally happening. But no, I just opened the doors and continued. I found key, but it didn't open the locked gate. And I must say that in this point I got a bit bored wandering around in darkness.\n\nI got 75% discount, but still this feels a bit waste of money. With a bit better controls, less shinier graphics and especially much less walking around aimlessly, this could be already much better game.\n","August 3, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not really a plesant jurney...\n\n\nPros / Cons / Long Version:\nPros:\n\nThe Music is really Awesome!\nThe protagonist, Walden, is a badass that can have his lantern in one hand, his rifle in the other and a table in the... third? ...or maybe with his mind!? How awesome is that!?\nIt also started off rather good setting up a rather scary atmosphere.\nEven after the first jumpscare it kinda managed to keep the atmosphere going...\nFlame reflection in the water looks neat!\nI kinda liked the blurring effects when poisoned and whatnot.\n\n...oh yea! Did I mention: The Music is really Awesome!\nCons:\n\nThe Filmgrain... it just gotta go!\nThe 'jumpscares'... the first one was a tiny bit scary, but no. It ain't really scary ( shifted to bright backround with 'scary' creatyre and high pitch noice ), the only thing it does is it just rips you out of the immersion of the atmosphere the game seems to be trying to build up.\nInvisible walls... Come on! There's only plains with grass and dirt as far as the eye can see, why can't I go hiking this way?\nThe non skippable cutscenes when having to run trough a corridor, push a button, wait for cutscene to open door/bars/whatever and then make my way back trough the corridor just to run off into my death and redo the whole chore again... and maybe a few more times...\nAs good as the music may be... the other sound effects doesn't really cut it... it's not horrible, but it aint awesome neither...\nAI was... well... Charge! ...most of them doesn't do it that fast though, which might be lucky because of:\nReloading! ...for... a verry long time. I don't really mind the really long reload time though, but it bugs me out because of the:\nAnimation! Especially the reloading animation, wich during the slowmo sequences is really apparant that it's just a rifle wobbling around in the air. And when it stopps wobbling around and you have it back to your shooting position... you wait for another? ...really long time, before you're actually able to shoot.\nOh, yea. More animations! The slow creatures running, leaping or whatever it does... it looks as if it should be getting somewhere, but it's almost standing still...\nOk, this aint that big of a deal but: The kinda cool slowly clibing down spiders... that once landed on the gound can't even climb the walls of their own webfilled lair? Just twitching against each other trying to hug the wall waiting for me to shoot them...\nAll the jumping around furniture, barrels, bottles etc that seems to be still when you leave the barn/house/whatever just to start jumping around in there making noices after you've left.\nThe glossiness of some textures is a bit high since if you look at the stairs in an old house you shouldn't be blinded by the glossy wood...\nConclusion:\n\nThe Music is really Awesome!\nAlso it starts out rather good, setting the mood and starting off with the story.\nBut after a couple of jumpdontcares, and what seemed to me like unfair deaths making me redo tedious chores, in the end resulted in a not really that plesant of a jurney...\n\nEven though it started out rather good and has potential, in this current state I cannot really reccomend this game.","March 1, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

XD\nBut hiring people to voice it costs a lot , and i think they didn't have the money for it.\nThis game was apparently made by 3 guys only, and it's kinda good.\n\nIt sure has some negative points , and some of them need improvement quicly\nNegative Points:\n- Film Grain (OMG, it has a lot of film grain , some people likes it , but i don't.)\n- Invisible Walls\n- Sometimes it doesn't tells you what to do.\n- The pause option doesn't work, it only shows the menu to you , but the game keeps running.\n- Blur on the screen is too intensive , you can barelly see something, it's even worse when you are fighting, i don't know why they put that, you are not even hurt to be seeing things like that.\n- Invisible walls even in places that would be useful if you could use it to walk , because it doesn't help being blocked by something you can't see.\n\nThose 2 last negatives points really need to be fixed,that's all for the negative points , the bur doesn't let you see where is the wewolf, 'cause he is black and it adds a red blur, then everything else is back, other uncool thing are the invisible walls, they are everywhere, it's like the guy who amde this wants you to follow a straight narrow path, in which you can barely move.\nAnyway, according to it's price , the game seems fair ,so, my final thought is: You should play the game , because the story isnt bad or boring, it just has some problems, but still playable!\n\nATTENTION: Don't play this game if you have a bad heart condition.\n\nPs: I think they made a really awesome game , then one of them said "Hey, it's too perfecty, let's make it worse, how about some invisible walls and blurring the player is vision on the most important parts?".","March 21","true","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

(I would write more, if there was more to say without spoiling the story). The plot is uninteresting and wasn't really given much of a thought. Graphic design is unpleasant, music - repetetive, mechanically a typical FPS without much thinking.\n\nWhy am I recommending this game then?  - because it's just about worth the 19 cents my friend bought it with, when apparently it's worth about 10 Euro off sale.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borador/recommended/293180/","Borador","Borador","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borador/","373 products in account","Introduction\nOvercast - Walden and the Werewolf is an Indie horror game where the player takes the role of the titular Walden, who is a reclusive hunter, living near a small village. One day he finds all the inhabitants brutally murdered and vows to hunt down the beast, responsible for this. Known as being a man without fear his courage is put to the test in this adventure.\n\nThe story ties in neatly with the gameplay as Walden is not defenseless on his journey. He can fight back the monsters he encounters by using his rifle. While this might seem to take away the tension at first, this is not the case. The monsters can kill Walden with only one hit, this paired with the comparatively long time it takes to reload, missing a shot can be a grave mistake.\n\nUnsurprisingly for this genre the locations which are featured in this game are grim and dark. This however is bypassed by the use of a lantern which always illuminates the immediate surroundings, so that the player can actually inspect the area instead of just stumbling in the dark. Furthermore there is a handy minimap which can be toggled on to help the player not to get lost.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is mostly conveyed through visual filters. They help to showcase certain things that are affecting Walden and help to create some sense of immersion. Unfortunately the opposite is achieved by the rest of the visual design. While the environments all look okay, some of the models are just off and don't look too scary as a result. The flames of the lantern among other things are especially irritating, as they appear to be all just the same sprite and they always move in sync, which is off putting. Lastly the shadows which are cast by the lantern’s light have a slight delay to them and keep moving after the source of light is already at a standstill. While these things could be accepted in another kind of game, this genre relies highly on immersion, which can easily be broken by menial details like this and thus affects the gameplay.\n\nThe sound design is competent. The sound effects for moving objects and characters are both fitting and unsettling and therefore add to the creepy atmosphere. The music cues in and out at appropriate moments and fits the game well.\n\nPros\n+ Fitting sound effects\n+ Nice atmosphere\n+ Visual effects\n+ stable gameplay without glitches\n\nCons\n- Some unrealistic physics\n- Some graphics distract from the atmosphere\n- Not very scary for experienced players\n\nConclusion\nThe game tells a classic monster story and sticks well to this premise. Unfortunately the creepy atmosphere is not preserved constantly as it is sometimes broken by unfortunate design choices. Nevertheless it manages to deliver some scares, but maybe not enough for horror game veterans. Thus I would recommend this game to people who are new to the genre as it helps them to find out whether they might like the genre by being relatively short and inexpensive and not too creepy to scare them away from the genre from the very start.\n\nRating:5.8 /10\n\nThis review was submitted for Golden Raffle Group, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.\n\nGame key provided by Microblast Games.\n","February 17","true","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/recommended/293180/","rsc","RSCNyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/","106 products in account","First game I've ever played that actually caused physical harm to me. Starting with the settings: There's no audio settings (this will be a big deal later), and there's no way to change the resolution from 1024x768. You can change it from full screen to not full screen, which is...great, I guess.\n\nI'm focusing on the settings, because the rest of the game is physically painful to play. The fact this doesn't have a health warning at the start of this game is surprising to me. First, the popscares. There's a lot of popscares, and they have two things in common: They usually look really silly, and they're REALLY loud. I can't even begin to emphasize how loud these popscares are. If you have headphones, you'll need to go into the Volume Mixer and lower this game to around 25%. I had it half-way and it was still really loud.\n\nSecond, the visual effects. There's a constant film grain on the screen at all times, and then a whole bunch of crazy effects such as making the screen blurry, making everything negative, or just making it flash a bunch. There were points where I honestly couldn't tell where I was going, or what I'm shooting at. These special effects literally make the game an eye sore, and there's no way to lower them, or, preferably, disable them entirely.\n\nThe story makes little sense. You play as a hunter who got beat up by assassins due to him wanting to find a rare bird. He survives, locks himself up in his house, eventually leaves to probably go find food or something, it turns dark, he goes home...and that's where the game begins. Trust me when I say you won't be interested in this hunter's story.\n\nThe only tolerable thing in this game is the soundtrack. It's currently free, and I do recommend at least that. For the game itself, if you have a friend who you don't want to be your friend anymore, by all means, send them this game. I'm sure they won't appreciate the headache that will come after.","February 24, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There just MOMENTUM 1-4 Then epilouge.... Like... Did You plan on making just a little bit of a level name, or just explain what happens before they play it.\n\nThe game decent enough for 20 cents, but the reason why its so cheap is because the guy is trying to advertise for his other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game so people can go vote on it, so the dev can go make a 30 cent game 5 bucks. Not cool.\n\nThis game is terrible. Nothing actually scary, just loud noises, a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing werewolf,and vision that makes my eyes hurt after playing.\n\nOh one more thing.\n\nI shot the glass, and thats what startled me the most in the game because i was expecting the Dev not to put time into breakable glass.

Sure, there are a few likeable things from Overcast- Walden and the Werewolf, such as the music, and the atmosphere, but there are some things that make it really bad. In the cutscenes, Walden is permanently stuck in a T-pose. On top of that, the story has some holes, and the writing isn't always grammatically correct. The single biggest problem in the game, however, is the reloading; It takes about 9 seconds to reload the rifle to fire a single shot, making it harder than it should be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/recommended/293180/","rsc","RSCNyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsc/","106 products in account","First game I've ever played that actually caused physical harm to me. Starting with the settings: There's no audio settings (this will be a big deal later), and there's no way to change the resolution from 1024x768. You can change it from full screen to not full screen, which is...great, I guess.\n\nI'm focusing on the settings, because the rest of the game is physically painful to play. The fact this doesn't have a health warning at the start of this game is surprising to me. First, the popscares. There's a lot of popscares, and they have two things in common: They usually look really silly, and they're REALLY loud. I can't even begin to emphasize how loud these popscares are. If you have headphones, you'll need to go into the Volume Mixer and lower this game to around 25%. I had it half-way and it was still really loud.\n\nSecond, the visual effects. There's a constant film grain on the screen at all times, and then a whole bunch of crazy effects such as making the screen blurry, making everything negative, or just making it flash a bunch. There were points where I honestly couldn't tell where I was going, or what I'm shooting at. These special effects literally make the game an eye sore, and there's no way to lower them, or, preferably, disable them entirely.\n\nThe story makes little sense. You play as a hunter who got beat up by assassins due to him wanting to find a rare bird. He survives, locks himself up in his house, eventually leaves to probably go find food or something, it turns dark, he goes home...and that's where the game begins. Trust me when I say you won't be interested in this hunter's story.\n\nThe only tolerable thing in this game is the soundtrack. It's currently free, and I do recommend at least that. For the game itself, if you have a friend who you don't want to be your friend anymore, by all means, send them this game. I'm sure they won't appreciate the headache that will come after.","February 24, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seems like the dev has some potential, and if a co-dev were to have helped with this game it could have been a lot better. Not worth the ten dollars, but definitely a steal for nineteen cents! As far as gameplay goes, it actually kept me somewhat engaged with the outrageous storyline and backlog. There are few jump scares in random places that sometimes make absolutely no sense, keep you a bit on the edge of being scared and laughing. This game extremely rough around the edges (as is my reveiew), but thats part of the fun! A funny bad bad game with great potential, keeps you somewhat interested, and on sale for nineteen cents?!

I've pondered around your latest comments before(yea, also when on sale!) and when I've bought and played it the last few mintues I feel totally comfy with it! And when I see your commnets again, I was like, "wow, sinister". Yes you got your point but I've got mine, and this is just what a g*ngbang looked like and its making ppl sick(rather then a demo, perhaps?), and they will think twice before buy is all. The maker is an absolute and dedicated fan of classic boltaction rifles to his very CORE and thats just what I've always been, mind you lead sprayers thats something that made the Great Old Wars rather then Afghanistan and I-Rack. Absolutely smooth and well polished game! Use ULTRA graphics and you can see even the dents and sratches on the window frames! I myself don't see that often in a game. From my short experiuence(now just unlocked the second level) I feel no glitches or weirdness whatsoever. (Even the the fruits in the bask look quite nice btw, don't ask pls I had to say it) Why not say NO to all the half life one(dated graphics and sometimes very grinding, ie. figuring out how to start a time machine) fans and yes I completed that one without even being born in the right galaxy to have a strategy guide in the 20th century! You were trying to make this one good guy go out of business for good or what? He did it single handedly, as I heard! YEAH I root for this game and this dude, no matter what that even means. And think this way, all these neg comments won't make a better maket, because this game can be gone rather then better if you keep on shelling like this; but you very likely are going to to ruin one man's life(exagerating? shoot me if you have to) - NOW how does that compare to our bankers? And it IS creepy, dark and suffocating(I honestly prefer my room deco to be silent hill 1 cage style). Finally, this guy put in your hands a good o' rifle and a lantern that goes on longer then your battery-fed flashlight that dies every 1~2 mins in most games and you be grateful to him, and his work. ps: you really loved making that rifle, God bless ya.","December 9, 2014","true","4.4"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","2"

The atmosphere isn't bad and it can keep you on the edge of your seat. For a horror game...the horror would be the surprise shock images and high pitched sounds that disrupt a rather peaceful listening experience. So basically cheap "boo" methods.\n\nThe game makes a lot of use of different filters which makes visibilty a bit of a pain at times and good luck with combat. You have a rifle that only shoots one bullet so you must slowly reload after every shot. And most enemies are not one hit kills.\n\nThe story line is interesting and I want to finish it to see how it ends. The music is also pretty awesome. If you can get over the slow reload, no run button (that I know of), and the tag-you-die gameover, it is a fun game to play.

It happens to me very frequently but not this time.\n\nSadly, "Overcast - Walden and the Werewolf" are full of weaknesses. Story is kinda awful. Sometimes it feels as bad as 7 years old  writings. So if you about to play this game - don't read anything.\n\nMusic... Well, it's definitely one of the weaknesses. It's too simple and narrow and doesn't fit the visual part in my opinion. But it's not that bad to ruin the game entirely. Let's just say it could be better.\n\nAlso the game is very short. I finished it in two hours.\n\nBuy it if you sure you can survive terrible story and pretty bad music. Otherwise this game is enjoyable.","July 13, 2014","true","1.7"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

I do not hate this game. Rather, I am simply disappointed.  The story concept was actually not that bad and, if handled by a larger company, could probably have been a good fantasy, western hybrid FPS. Nevertheless, this game wastes my time with relentless jumpscares, a story with no real point, and an unresponsive hit detection on the part of the rifle.","July 8, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","1"

Its really rough around the edges, and is really short, only about 2 hours long I would guess.  One thing I have to say is that the soundtrack is really good. There is nothing shoddy about the music in this game, so that was definitely a plus.  I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of "youtube horror games" (in my mind that has its own genre).\n\nThere is not much plot, so dont come hoping for a good story. There is just enough there to keep the game from being "meaningless". Besides the above points I am not sure what else I have to say about the game besides to mention the price. I got this as a gift while it was on sale for less that 20 cents. I cant say clearly enough to NOT BUY THIS FOR THE FULL PRICE. There are tons of games worth 10 dollars, this, at least in my opinion is not one of them. this is definitely one to wait for a sale!","December 27, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This is not a masterpiece, but I congratulate the developer for bringing this on Steam on his own. It's not easy. Well now to the game: Sometimes I felt I was just following sequence of events that always ended up on a cheap jump-scare loud sound and disturbing image, sometimes it was very predictible. BUT some other times I really got into the atmosphere and the game got me really nervous at some points. The game should have exploited more elements and bringed more experience-driven scary sequences or events rather than cheap scaring. The graphics are Ok and the Soundtrack is really good. Loved the guitar theme. I would recommend getting this game as a bonus of a bundle (as I did) or buying it on a SUPER sale. Other than that it's an OK game to kill some time and get some scary moments. I hope the dev makes another game with more moments like the monster chase in the mountain where you could only slow down the creature by shooting it but not kill it, I guess that was my favourite part of the game.","September 11, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The gameplay is a bit cheap and the story is so so but overall the game is very enjoyable. I actually played in broad daylight and jumped at most jump scares. And i'm not the kind to make stuff up when it comes to scary games. The game is not that scary but anyways if you do play it you will understand what I mean when the game doesn't warn you 5 seconds before something screams in your face. As far as the graphics I don't really want to give any notes on that because depending on how you look at it, they are amasing yet not that great. The art style is kind of an LSD bad trip in a good way... The pirce is a bit too high for what it is though if you get it in a sale or in a bundle you will very much enjoy the few hours this game will offer you.\n\nOriginality 9/10\nMusic 10/10\nStory 7/10\nGameplay 6/10","June 19, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

But will they step it up with Overcast ? In Overcast you play as Walden. Walden is the most famous hunter in the land. But after a fearsome fight Walden is left injured and only leaves his home at night. One day Walden finds out that an evil spirit Zappiroth destroyed his home village killing everyone who lived there. So its up to you to pick up youre rifle and go fight the demon. So how is Overcast ? Overall this game is average. The game is a huge way better than dead bits but there are its own unique problems and ill try to say everything thats wrong and good with the game. The game is a standart FPS stuff. You can use the rifle to fight demons and bosses but its the most usseless gun in a video game ever doing very little to no damage and the reload speed is incredibly slow and in some parts of the game it doesnt help cause you have to act quickly. For the pros. Game for one guy looks pretty good nothing too special. The soundtrack is great and its the highlight of the game. The game also has pretty good atmopshere. But there are some things that i dont like about it. In some parts Walden starts to trip out and the game drops frame rates and its hard to see where you are walking. The gunplay is absolute garbage and you can never hit what you actually want to hit. Boss fights are annoying and take up too much time. The game is incredibly short only 9 chapters long. Overall i really wished there was a middle option for reviews but now im gonna give it a positive review cause the game aint that bad but its not good either. Overall get this game at a sale and enjoy this game as it is. I give Overcast Walden and the Warewolf a 6/10","December 19, 2014","true","3.5"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

I found the game mechanics good and easy to operate and familiarise myself with but ultimately the game lacked in content you could get yourself sucked into and didn't give you the chance to connect to the character Walden mainly due to the lack of voice acting. While I may not think Walden and the Werewolf is one of the best games when it comes to an original story I do think the creators have something going for them and I deffinetly would buy the game again to support them in the hope of future games...

The story is not that entising, the writing and text in the cutscenes are both aweful and mispelled. The rifle used throughout the game gets annoying to use simply because you have to reload every shot, the main character, Walden, takes forever to reload, and the reload animation barely qualifies as a reload animation. There is no sprint button, which makes it harder to move around in these huge open areas and takes longer to progress. And the game is just boring. Repetative. And, dare i say, tedious. And those are not words you want associated with your game. Don't get me wrong i understand these are indie developers and were probably working with a very low or limited budget. However, like i said in the beginning, I have very low expectations. I am not one to trash other games for not meeting the Triple A games in equal levels. I mean no disrespect to this game's developers, but you guys need to learn from this mistake if you plan to make games in the future. Take my review as you will. Just know that if you guys make another game I may not play because of this one unless I see a description that describes the game to my liking.","March 21, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was alone. Supplies running low. Last snickers bar. Last doritos. Brink of insanity. No where to run. No where to hide. No hope... Only fear. However, there was one brink of sudden hope. He was, Mr.Table, my only friend. I found him in a wooden room, surrounded with chairs, humiliated with a mug of flowers. With a sudden burst of relatability, I did the only thing I could. I grabbed him and took him with me. Together we immediately became intense friends on a journey on the "horror" badly made world. We had many adventures and faced horrible challenges, however we always made it out at the end. However that is what it used to be. One horrible day, Mr. Table, got stuck through the door. We both knew it would be the end of him, but I said nothing. With only a bleak, but hopeful stare, he told me to let go and go on without him. Knowing of his demise, I had to do what he said.

The story is not that entising, the writing and text in the cutscenes are both aweful and mispelled. The rifle used throughout the game gets annoying to use simply because you have to reload every shot, the main character, Walden, takes forever to reload, and the reload animation barely qualifies as a reload animation. There is no sprint button, which makes it harder to move around in these huge open areas and takes longer to progress. And the game is just boring. Repetative. And, dare i say, tedious. And those are not words you want associated with your game. Don't get me wrong i understand these are indie developers and were probably working with a very low or limited budget. However, like i said in the beginning, I have very low expectations. I am not one to trash other games for not meeting the Triple A games in equal levels. I mean no disrespect to this game's developers, but you guys need to learn from this mistake if you plan to make games in the future. Take my review as you will.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmushParkerfan420/recommended/293180/","SmushParkerfan420","someone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmushParkerfan420/","45 products in account","I bought this game for 20 cents, thinking I couldn't go wrong with buying such a cheap game. I was wrong.\n\nThe controls are painfuly simple. WASD for movement, left click to shoot, and right click to pick up items/zoom.\n\nYou have one gun the entire game. And if that isn't bad enough, it's a single-shot rifle that takes 7-10 seconds to reload before you can use it again. Seriously. Enemies are fairly scarce in the game, but when they show up, they're unbelievably annoying to deal with. The first enemy in the game I had to fight (a giant snake), took me FIVE well placed shots to kill. Needless to say, I had to walk (I say walk, because YOU CAN'T RUN IN THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME) in circles for a couple mins after every shot just to reload. The extremely long reloading time wouldn't be too much of a burden if you didn't die after getting hit once. But of course, that is how this game is unfortunately.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game is the graphics. They're honestly so bad, that it serves as a major inconvience when you're trying to figure out where the ♥♥♥♥ you are (which tends to happen often, even though the game is quite linear). The game's graphics are mostly based around an extremely un-needed film grain, which looks like one of those heavily colored instagram filters. Not joking or exaggerting. You do have a lantern in the game, but  it seriously only illuminates your feet. I can understand what the developers where going for with this game; a mysterious, eerie, middle-of-nowhere-fuzzy type of look. The execution of the idea falls more flat than a pancake. The game just looks terribly blurry all of the time, so your characters peripheral vision ends up being vacant; sort of a tunnel vision kind of view. It doesn't help when you're facing the other enemy in the game, (Werewolf) as 1: you can't kill it during the early course of the game, but only slow it down per every shot you land. And 2: THE GAME BECOMES MORE ♥♥♥♥ING BLURRY, AND ADDS AN OBNOXIOUS RED FILTER (call of duty esque; but a lot poorer) so you can only see the shadow outline of the creature.\n\nThe story might actually be the strongest point of the game, but that is not saying much what-so-ever. The game has SEVERAL plot holes, and is more rushed than a man who woke up 2 minutes before he has work. Most of the game is making you look in a house for a key, which is used to unlock another house with another key, which is used to unlock another house.....more likely than not for another ♥♥♥♥ing key. The game isn't really ever clear with what your main objective is other than finding the werewolf and killing him. But of course in your quest of doing so, you're stuck going from point A to point B, collecting generally useless things and moving on to the next area (with barely any context to why you're going to this place).\n\nI really wanted to enjoy this game, (hell, i still might try to for whatever reason) but this game takes one step forward, and 3 steps back. Then shoots itself in the foot, because nothing in this game makes any ♥♥♥♥ing sense at all.\n\nI wish I had more to say, but I've ran out of things to criticize. But to summarize, this game is worth the 20 cents I spent on it, but if it was anything over 99 cents I would recommend buying an Arizona instead, since you'll enjoy it more than this confusing, clunky, poorly crafted "game"\n\n3.5/10.

(These happen about once per "level.") The game in general seems like it was done overnight with a person running on redbull and skittles. The gun in the game is beyond shiny. I guess when you are a lone hunter in the woods you just take to shining your guns. His gun also takes a year and a half to reload, and you have to reload after every shot. Also, Walden appears to have 3 arms. How else can he hold a lantern, a gun, and throw chairs around?\n\nI didn't finish the story but I might play more later and revise my review, but for now the story gets a 3/10.\nCombat gets a 2/10.\nGraphics gets a 4/10.\nEntertainment: 2/10.\n\nBut, considering the price....

It's certainly not expensive and worth a looksie at the very least. Personally, I really love the music. I don't think it would go well in a typical horror game, but this isn't a typical horror game. It's got some horror elements: jump scares, blurry/grainy filters, shadowy enemies... but for me it's more a first person adventure game focused on revenge and the search for truth with horror on the side. So I think the music fits. It fits the player character and it fits the vibe of the game, but ymmv.\n\nIt doesn't look great, but it's not like it looks horrible either. The grainy filter over everything sort of helps the looks, though it is a bit too blurry at some points. The story isn't great, but I don't think it's that bad either. All in all it's $1 and if you wind up hating it after you play it a bit, you can get a refund. But it's worth a shot.","August 30, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got it for 19 cents. Scratch that, this is discount Air Control. Costs less and is less broken, but still a true testament to using stock assets as your entire game. Every texture in this game for some reason is shiny and glossy. I would go into more detail on the graphics than that, if it weren't for the CONSTANT FILM GRAIN EFFECT MAKING EVERYTHING HARD TO SEE. When it was on the cutscenes I thought, "Huh, that's really annoying, I hope they don't do that for the entire game," but of course, they do. The story is...a story...You play as a hunter whose name I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about, who apperently got jumped one time by 3 bandits. The hunter kills the bandits and was, according to rumors, losing so much blood that he shouldn't be alive. Why is that important? Anyway, after that delightful experience, the hunter is like, "Yea...that whole going outside thing...yea ♥♥♥♥ that noise," and stays in his house for a long time. After some time has passed, he finally decides to go out, for no explained reason, and the sky turns black. Of course, as the game puts it, he calmly goes back inside his house. AND THAT'S THE STORY! I wish...No he instead goes inside to get his gun and has the roof fall on his head. Then he ventures forth into the night, again for no explained reason. Will he succeed? Will he die? I didn't give a ♥♥♥♥ and gave up after about 5 minutes. Wait I remember, his name is Walden! I can't believe I forgot even with the title right above me writing this review. BEST MAIN CHARACTER EVER! Now I would normally not recommend this game for it being....well....♥♥♥♥. But, this game is something everyone needs to experience for one reason. That reason is that the only two options in the main menu are "GAME" and "X". I love video games sometimes.","September 6, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything in the world is shiny, your objectives are not clear, and the "scares" are the tried and true jump scares with very little originality in the story.

The guitar playing and musical backing is well done.  The in-game audio is well presented, and there are a couple of jumps that are likely to startle you.  The two diminsional art is well made, and those things save the game from being a complete disaster.\nGet this one sale if you want a quick horror themed romp with some frustration, but overall, pass this one up.","July 9, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a nice atmosphere, even though it lacks much substance. You can flick the switch to turn of your brain for this one, if you want. Because if you don't, it'll be a cliched mess of boring repetitiveness, and I'm sure you don't want to be one of THOSE guys.\nSo, for what it's worth, you should get it, but only if it has drastically come down in price!","July 13, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I personally bought it when it was 19 cents but even without the sale its still worth getting.

I'd rather pay twenty cents to get kicked in the shin than finish this game. First of all, everything thing is wet. Wood is wet. Burnt bodies are wet. Even the water looks too wet. Also, why does my character continuously take tabs of acid on his journey. Why did the developer put on every camera effect avaliable... Except Sepia, which would have actually suited the game due to it's western atmosphere. Also, have to mention, they copied and pasted the fire animation and when you line two or more fires together, they all have the same animation tempo. But, I have to give kudous to Walden for being able to hold a lantern in one hand, a rifle in his other, and climb ladders without using his hands.

The story was bland and the ending was very Monster-A-Go-Goesque (if you get that reference, hey nice to meet a fellow mstie, how are ya?).  The shooting mechanics were frustrating....and since this is a horror game, normally I'd be okay with that.  I don't want to be able to mow down spiders and skeletons (yes, there are spiders and skeletons in the werewolf game) with a machine gun, I want to have to make split decisions on whether to waste time and ammo fighting or to just run.  Except this game doesn't give you a choice.  There are sections where you are forced to kill all of the enemies before you can continue.  So the shoddy shooting just stands out more.\n\nBut the soundtrack's pretty good.

Don't let the screenshots fool you, this is as amateur as you can get. While it was only made by two guys, Unturned was made by a teenager still in school, his game is a far better game just overall and it's free. This game however, the textures are really bad, they twist and distort textures to reuse on another model. The character Walden is unoriginal, the story is full of tropes and cliches. There is no sprint and reloading after every shot takes at LEAST 5 seconds and that's not an exaggeration by any means. It's very tedious.\n\nThe character is using both hands while still somehow picking up boxes and items. During "cutscenes" the character model is terrible, if you've ever modded a game or seen a character model glitch out and they stand straight up with their arms out by their sides, this is the model they use for Walden in every scene, even in the scene where Walden dies, they lay him down and put his hat over his face, arms still to his sides they animated the enemies but didn't bother to animate the main character, good job. The boss fights? Irritating to say the least, consisting of mainly strafing and praying that Walden reloads faster, if they touch you once, you die and have to start over, "cutscene" and all but esc skips that, thank god.\n\nThe map design? Shoddy to say the least, it might creep out a kid but for anyone who knows 2 bits about game design, it was lazily done. Each "chapter" takes about 5-10 minutes depending how lost you get. The game is really dark despite Walden having a lantern. The house's don't look like they could fit one person let alone a family for a "village" the doors are huge though. Dungeon chapter, let's copy and paste this gate texture/model all over the place, that looks spoopy.\n\nNormally my stance is, an hour of enjoyment per dollar for the game price, while I spent 2 hours on this game and it's only a dollar, most of it was from getting lost, giving up and or dying. I didn't get a single hour of enjoyment out of this, why did I even bother to keep playing it?

Don't let the screenshots fool you, this is as amateur as you can get. While it was only made by two guys, Unturned was made by a teenager still in school, his game is a far better game just overall and it's free. This game however, the textures are really bad, they twist and distort textures to reuse on another model. The character Walden is unoriginal, the story is full of tropes and cliches. There is no sprint and reloading after every shot takes at LEAST 5 seconds and that's not an exaggeration by any means. It's very tedious.\n\nThe character is using both hands while still somehow picking up boxes and items. During "cutscenes" the character model is terrible, if you've ever modded a game or seen a character model glitch out and they stand straight up with their arms out by their sides, this is the model they use for Walden in every scene, even in the scene where Walden dies, they lay him down and put his hat over his face, arms still to his sides they animated the enemies but didn't bother to animate the main character, good job. The boss fights? Irritating to say the least, consisting of mainly strafing and praying that Walden reloads faster, if they touch you once, you die and have to start over, "cutscene" and all but esc skips that, thank god.\n\nThe map design? Shoddy to say the least, it might creep out a kid but for anyone who knows 2 bits about game design, it was lazily done. Each "chapter" takes about 5-10 minutes depending how lost you get. The game is really dark despite Walden having a lantern. The house's don't look like they could fit one person let alone a family for a "village" the doors are huge though. Dungeon chapter, let's copy and paste this gate texture/model all over the place, that looks spoopy.\n\nNormally my stance is, an hour of enjoyment per dollar for the game price, while I spent 2 hours on this game and it's only a dollar, most of it was from getting lost, giving up and or dying. I didn't get a single hour of enjoyment out of this, why did I even bother to keep playing it? I'm a completionist and just had to beat this game so I could uninstall it, make a review to warn others and forget it exists. Hell I'd try to get a steam refund but I have 2.3 hours on record unfortunately.","January 15","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, as the story unfolds, the game becomes less horror and more action packed. Which is unfortunate because the game has a downright terrible gun that takes centuries to reload and fire a shot.\nThis makes the game frustrating as all enemies one shot the player upon touch. There are no check points; any deaths in the game cause the player to begin from the beginning of level. This becomes aggravating in the last three levels of the game; most especially in the last level.","January 17","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The horror part is completly missing, the story is just a big bunch of nonsense, and the gameplay is horrendous.\nThe name of the game could easily be "Jumpscares-the game". There is one around every corner, usually very predictable and not at all scary. One of the bosses of the game is giant snake, that looks like a sock and the skeletons looks like they are made of papier mache. And of course, when all other methods of scaring people fail, they bring out the giant spiders.\nThe following paragraph contains spoilers of the 'story', the term 'story' being used loosley. There is very little connection between the chapters of the game. Walden just randomly ends up on a boat, then in the "Dungeon of Pain" (let that name sink in), then in some cemetery.\nThe gameplay is despicable. The Hunter has a shotgun in his right hand and a lantern in the left. The said shotgun can be loaded with only one bullet at a time, meaning you have you reload after every. single. ♥♥♥♥ing. shot. The reloading process takes about 4 seconds. However, when he realods, he also puts the lantern down, and when hes done, he brings up the  shotgun. But this doesn't mean, that you can already take your second shout, that would make too much sense. First, you have to wait a second or two while be brings up the damn latern too. So that means that you have to wait about 5-6 seconds between shots. Now, if I'll count how many times I've died, because he didn't bring his lamp up yet...\nOr beacuse the enemies spawned on me...\nDo yourself a favor, don't buy this.","February 2","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I know the levels are short, but when the combat is so badly designed, you don't want to fight everything again cos you got killed by an enemy that tripped over a bone on the floor and learned to fly...\nThe last battle is too hard. I gave up at this point.
