Not worth $10. It is a playable game, but last I checked, there is no multiplayer, and its very simply done. The core game logic is there, but the animations are simple and cheesy, and they don't fit the theme of a tabletop game.\n\n","June 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

The salvo and Superweapons game modes add a bit more dimension instead of simply B1, miss, C3, miss, D6, hit..... ect...\n\nNothing special, but easily worth it if you find it on sale or liked this game growing up,","July 1, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I still try thinking maybe i will get lucky and catch a break and get the weapons to win the super weapons level as far as the rest of the salvoe mode and classic excellent! a fun game.","February 8, 2015","true","47.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1observant/recommended/227900/","the1observant","the1observant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the1observant/","40 products in account","If you're looking for a simple, but still cool, single-player Battleship game, then Pop Cap made the perfect one right here. Not only does it show the use of white and red pegs to give an authentic feel to it, but also some animated radar cosmetics. You're shown some eye candy animated cutscenes with every shot for either a miss or a hit, and the background graphics comes complete with random weather and ambient sound effects. You can easily immerse yourself into the game and play for hours while trying to increase your rank. It's a very pleasant "chillaxing" type of game where everything is point-n-click super easy.\n\nI like all 3 modes of Classic, Salvo, and Super Weapon, but Super Weapon is my favorite mode. Super Weapon is probably everybody's favorite.\n\nIn Classic mode it's your basic Battleship game where you and the computer take turns destroying each other. Not that much to it.\n\nIn Salvo mode it's a Ship-turn-Shot game. If you have 5 ships, then you get 5 shots on your turn. Lose a ship and you lose a shot for only 4 shots per turn. Then 3, 2, and 1, if you're having a bad game. Trying to maintain 5 shots is really hard to do, but not impossible. Salvo is Salvo, that's all there is to it.\n\nIn Super Weapon mode it's a Weapons-charge-Shot game. You only get 1 shot per turn, but you can really make that shot count when your weapons charge up. With one shot you can fire upon 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15+ coordinates, depending on what weapon you have loaded into your arsenal. There's bombers, gun-copters, shields, satellite laser beams, mines, decoy's, and a bunch of others I haven't even unlocked yet. Yes, you have to unlock most of the weapons by continuing to play the game and keep sinking enemy ships over and over, round after round. You also have to rank up to unlock some of the weapons too.\n\nThe graphics are not superb, but it's good enough for this type of game.\n\nThe sounds would be what you normally expect with clicks, explosions, turret effects, and other sounds matching their device or purpose. Some of the ambient sounds can get a little annoying and repetitive, but still tolerable.\n\nNow let's talk about the A.I. - It starts out rather easy and appears to be dumb at first, but after you play the game and start ranking up, the A.I. appears to match your rank and gains intelligence. It also uses a multiple random seed to pick coordinates and this is reflected with the multiple decisions you see the A.I. making before taking a shot. Seeking your ships is completely random, but after it gets a hit the A.I. will concentrate on sinking that ship with similar human intelligence. You will notice the A.I. behavior by the time you reach Captain and your usual ship configurations that used to trick the A.I. does not work anymore. That's how I know this Battleship game has an advanced A.I., and is a worthy opponent.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes board games.","March 30","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I drawback I can say is that fact it is singleplayer only since battleship has always been a two player game, this is unfortunate but, I suppose if you don't have a person to play battleship with this works almost as well.
