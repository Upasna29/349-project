Got that?! Everyone ok with that? Good, moving on. This game is awesome!\n\nSteve Jackson's CYOA books have a strong positive reputation, so I won't focus this on the base material. I'll focus my commentry on the adaptation. Tin Man Games have stayed faithful to the original material, focusing on using the format of the VN to enhance the experience. Sound and music stings, strong colour illustrations, the whole adventure has a nice oldschool sense of fun, and there's a lot of new content here. They've done a lot more than just transcribe the book.\n\nMy two main notes to caution people: this is an old school Choose Your Own Adventure book. Tin Man have done a good job of enabling replays and turning back to a prior page is very simple, but inspite of this, you're still going to want to play through things a few times to really understand how to tackle things.\n\nAlso, the comedy on occasion is a little blatant. I laughed at the fact that our 'civilian clothes' are a Clark Kent hat and glasses.... over our superhero costume. ;) Still, the compulsary random names is something that might irritate people.\n\nHowever, Appointment with FEAR was still a ton of fun.

As soon as I saw this on Steam, I threw money at it. Was I disappointed? Yes.\nThe graphics are really nice, well-done comic style that really fits the theme of the game. The name generator and much of the text is anywhere between amusing and downright hilarious. Gameplay is set over the course of several days, giving you a chance to stop (or ignore) different crimes, explore different locations, and make a lot of decisions about where to go next.\nSo what's the problem?\nIt is too faithful to the unforgiving nature of the original books - specifically, those books where you had to collect certain items ('do you have a <statue, etc>?') and / or paragraph numbers to go with them, meaning that if you took one misstep, you would end up failing. The better amongst the original gamebooks didn't use that system, and gave you more chance of being able to complete it without having to follow an absolute sequence. Yes, there is a rewind feature ... but that made it feel a bit more hopeless to me. You have to pick the exact right way through, otherwise, you get to sit through that same damnable ending of the bad guys win, city is destroyed, you fail. Along the way, you will find lots of clues that you're supposed to match to various locations; I've played through maybe 3 or 4 times, and managed to match one or two clues, total. Frustrating. I keep thinking, yeah, I want to beat this ... but every time I go back to play, I think about how frustrating it is, knowing that if I don't follow that golden path, none of my choices are going to mean anything, and I am going to see that same ending again. Also, stopping crimes / capturing bad guys nets you Hero Points (for use with the in-game collectible card system) ... if you fail the adventure, said points are generally wiped out by the loss you take for failing the main objective.\nMaybe I was more flexible as a kid, and the books were harder than I remember, but I can only think of one out of the dozens I played through that gave me anything like this much trouble (Starship Traveller)\n\ntl;dr: might be worth it for the nostalgia and the fun of the first couple of playthroughs, but can get very frustrating, and feel very shallow.","October 18, 2014","false","1.8"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","43","52","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/316140/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Now that visual novels are quickly becoming the next big thing on Steam it’s getting harder to find out which ones are worth the money and time, and which ones aren’t. Appointment With FEAR might not reinvent the genre but it does its best to give you a unique experience nevertheless.\n\nI can be very short about Appointment With FEAR. It’s a challenging, but fun interactive graphic novel where you make important choices and battle enemies, graphic novel-style. In other words, you fight crime, to the best of your abilities. And while you’re doing all of this you also have to find out where the evil organization FEAR is having its next secret meeting. The thing is, you only have three days to find out. Oh dear.\nThe game starts with you selecting a gender and, after that, your abilities/superpowers. Then it will show you an avatar that you may use as your character. If you don’t like it you can switch between several other designs and once you’ve made your final choice you can then select a primary and secondary color for your costume and after that a totally random and wacky name (that probably doesn’t come anywhere close to what you had in mind).\nOnce the game begins you’re given choices about what you want to do and where you want to go. So you can go to work and on the way there stop a thief or get to a seemingly more important situation. Your CrimeWatch will also frequently give you updates about situations and villains.\nSome situations will help you find clues that you can later use to try and solve other situations; getting a note from a person on the street might help you prevent an assassination on the president later on, for example. All you have to do then is select the appropriate clue from the list and the game will give you new options to work with. If you never received the note then he might be assassinated. This is just one of the many situations the game throws at you. In fact, there are so many choices that you never really know if it’s the right one until a few hours into the game, after you played a few more games. Yes, your first game might not last as long as you think. That’s partially thanks to the fact that it’s game over if you didn’t find out where the secret meeting is located within the given ‘time’ limit (there’s no timer, but obviously doing activities progresses your day).\nEach of the superpowers has you finding different clues so you can’t just make the same choices each and every time you play with a different character. These superpowers also impact the fights with villains and other enemies; some might become harder, others easier. Fights are turn-based and you can select an easy, medium and hard attack, with the latter one having a bigger chance to miss (but of course it does more damage if the hit connects). If any of the stamina stats is depleted then the battle is over. So far, the battles haven’t been much of a problem and they’re usually rather easy.\nSolving crimes and problems will help you earn hero points. These will show up once the game is over and if you earned more than 15 points you’ll earn a free FEAR card. If you fail to solve a problem a predefined number will be subtracted from your total score. Let’s back up for a bit. ‘FEAR cards ?’, I hear you saying. Yup, there are collectible cards to be earned just by playing. Beat an enemy or properly solve a problem and it might earn you a card. There are quite a few cards to be collected and these range from common to very rare. By finding and collecting clues you can try to increase the percentage of getting a better card. Each clue will increase this number by a few percent. It’s a time consuming activity and it will take you probably tens of hours before you have the complete set. The problem is, you’ll probably have lost interest after 5-10 hours of playing. There just isn’t enough gameplay to keep you occupied for longer than that.\n\nThe presentation of Appointment With FEAR is more than solid. It has a comic book vibe (with lots of unused space on the sides, unfortunately) with some cool animated effects, even though the use of effects is kept to a minimum. The characters and drawings are done very well, but some of the civilians’ faces could’ve used a little more work in my opinion. Some of them are just plain ugly.\nClicking the mouse will move the screen down in comic-book-style-fashion, which looks cool and is absolutely something you would expect to see in a game about being a superhero.\nUnfortunately the music is quite repetitive and the sound effects are also kept to a minimum so that department could also have benefited from some extra work and polish. There’s no voice acting, by the way.\n\nLength-wise a game will last you roughly thirty minutes max I think. But it’s fun to just fool around with the choices to see what happens. However, should you decide to try and complete the game it will probably take you at least 5 hours before you’re done with the first character. After that you can try out the other characters and even though the clues are then found in other places many of the other events will play out the exact same way as your other character. So, like I said, it will probably be fun for 5-10 hours. Others might enjoy it more, of course, and some might enjoy it less. It’s hard to say really.\n\nAppointment With FEAR is a cool game with quite a bit of replay value. I have to say that I expected a more straightforward game here so I can say that I was, once more, pleasantly surprised. It’s a game about making choices so if you’re looking for an action packed game you will have to continue your search. But, if you liked what you just read and/or if you’re intrigued (even if it’s a little bit) then this is definitely something you have to check out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bouncybhall/recommended/316140/","bouncybhall","Bouncybhall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bouncybhall/","611 products in account","I Have Nothing to Fear Except F.E.A.R. Itself…\n\nIt’s not secret that I adore Fighting Fantasy game books - I reviewed the recently released iOS app of House of Hell a while back http://maturegamerpodcast.com/bouncybhall-spends-a-night-in-the-house-of-hell/ - but what many folk don’t realise is that the beloved Fighting Fantasy series wasn’t simply full of books based in a fantastical realm of dragons and demons.\n\nWith books such as Space Assassin and The Rings of Kether providing a sci-fi fantasy setting and House of Hell and Beneath Nightmare Castle scaring the bejesus out of kids up around the world it was the Super Heroes and Super Villains setting of Appointment With F.E.A.R. that excited me most growing up.\n\nSteve Jackson created a world populated with puns and thinly veiled parodies of famous comic book folk (both creator and character) as you, The Silver Crusader fought the good fight and protected the citizens of Titan City. It was a very exciting variation on the concept of a fantasy adventure and I adored it. I never completed it legitimately though, it was very difficult and I always favoured the ‘fingers in the pages’ technique to get me through the story.\n\nJump forward to more modern days and the good folk at Tin Man Games announced that they were halting work on their Appointment with F.E.A.R. adaptation to pursue an exciting new direction. Part inspired by Inkle Studios’ work on Steve Jackson’s Sorcery! and part inspired by a decision to go from game book to graphic novel in style they invoked a little storm of hate from the rabid Fighting Fantasy fan base. How dare these upstarts mess around with the classics, eh? Well, I’m glad that they did. Because their final version of Appointment with F.E.A.R. is a joy to play.\n\nThis release also represents the first Fighting Fantasy game they’ve released on Steam and as I am well versed in their iOS apps, I decided to concentrate my review on the Steam release. Getting the housekeeping out of the way it supports PC, Mac and Linux as well as featuring a Kev-pleasing Big Picture and Controller support mode from launch. Throw in a pile of Steam achievements and more, and you will know that Tin Man have gone above and beyond for their Steam debut.\n\nSo how does a tactile app translate to the world of the personal computer? Well, in short it is pretty much untouched from the iOS version (which I’ve had a splash around on for comparison reasons) but this isn’t a criticism. It retains the interactive graphic novel feel and has a pleasingly free form interaction element as you can click on some elements on the game screen to generate small effects and animations. The game also allows a bit more control over ‘who’ you play in the game with pre-set elements with a degree of customisation, but all held in the grip of the developers to retain the ‘realism’ of the Fighting Fantasy world that Jackson created way back in 1985.\n\nThe influence of Inkle’s inspired Sorcery! Apps is evident from the get go as text from the book is laid on the screen line by line, being influenced by your choices. Some of the more odd choices you can make are complimented with great achievements that serve to shame you for your odd decision making prowess, and since starting the game a few times I have been poked for blaming dinosaurs for heinous crimes, for mentally making toast and for being vane, and I needed it to save me from myself.\n\nDecisions do not always result in success, and the game rewards/punishes the player with a Hero points system that dictates how good a hero you are, and if you are likely to get a bonus card at the end of your run. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention them. So, Tin Man have added F.E.A.R. cards to the game as unlockable collectible cards that you collect during the game (and mobile users will be able to trade these via Facebook) and they add an extra element of replayability to the game as a whole. As you play the game you also unlock Luck Points that can be exchanged for a better chance of getting a rarer card. It’s not an essential addition by any stretch of the word, but it is a worthy one regardless.\n\nThe game makes good use of the quips used by super heroes, tracking them and providing me with a hearty final laugh in the ‘Game Stats’ section that follows each adventure - even if ending in resounding failure. The humour that runs through the game is the life blood of it’s very being. It may be set in the Eighties, but Watchmen this ain’t. Instead you are at the centre of a silver age style adventure, armed with a familiar looking ‘Crime Watch’, a selection of put downs and a hard-♥♥♥ boss who seems determined on firing you. Life as a super hero can be harder when having to live the mundane ‘incognito’ lifestyle that you use to protect your secret, heroic identity.\n\nOn the whole I have spent about three hours on Appointment With F.E.A.R. so far, and can see myself dipping in and out for a good few weeks to come. I even pulled my original Puffin published book off of the shelf, cracked out some dice and sharpened a pencil to give the original a revisit. I was blown up by a car bomb within fifteen mins. Good job I kept my finger in the pages. But could I do this on the game if I wanted? Well Yes, actually. The game has a very clever checkpoint system that allows you to jump back a little and attempt to avoid humiliating failure on a replay. Or reset the whole game. Or choose new super abilities. Perhaps it wasn’t wise to fight a giant stone creature with a Psi-powered super hero, and you think it’s worth going back through as a super strength character. Well, the option is there.\n\nFinally, and I mention this as it is a very pleasing thing to note, the game supports the OpenDyslexic typeface that makes it easier for people with Dyslexia to access products with text. In a game so reliant on reading I can only applaud the good folks at Tin Man for ensuring that this app is open to as many people as possible. Sometimes a game is all we need, and there are enough barriers in life it is fantastic to see more and more developers working on accessibility. Bravo to you all!\n\nSo in summary Appointment with F.E.A.R. is a very polished and accomplished effort from Tin Man Games. For any one who has ever raider their older sister’s room, stolen some tights and a cape and taken to the streets to avenge the death of a beloved uncle it is an ESSENTIAL purchase. To those right minded folk who would never consider such acts of perversion and vigilantism it’s a great way to still live out a super-powered existence.\n\nMy character is like Jonathan Creek with the ability to punch a bad guy through a shipping container.  Who wouldn’t love that, eh?\n\nAppointment with F.E.A.R. is available now on Android, iOS and Steam (as well as being in the Humble Store if you are so inclined). It is almost essential gaming for anyone who enjoys graphic novels, interactive fiction or watching helplessly as a Ripper Shark kills a child in a very familiar scene….\n\nReviewed on the Steam version provided by the developers.\n\nRunning on The Falcon.","August 26, 2014","true","11.4"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","33","49","0","1"

The other leaders of the evil organization, who are set on conquering the world, are having a meeting and it is up to you to stop them.  You have three (3) short days to search for clues to discover the exact place and time it's gonna happen.\nYou start by choosing the powers of your character.  However, you are limited to four (4) powers which has an effect on the outcome of the game and also the choices made available to you.  You can also pick the costume and looks of your superhero but they are rather limited.  Moreover, you can also pick the name of your character from a selection of "WTF kinda name is that" (e.g.The Incomparable Romance or Indifferent Thoughtstealer).  Perhaps, this is held back by copyright laws.\nThe graphics and art style are rather nice for a text and still picture game. The visuals are great which is a mix of digital comic books and small moving videos.  I loved the soundtrack and music at the beginning but it got rather annoying the longer I played the game.  I turned the music off when I started seeking 100% achievements.\nThe gameplay is fun coz there are lots of humurous scenarios, places to discover, several villains and criminals to fight and  tons of clues to choose from.  Some outcomes are hilarious and will appear depending on the path you choose.\nIf you love comic books the game is an excellent pick.  The game has a good replay value with unlockable cards.  Some paths may repeat themsleves and sometimes might go on in a loop, if you don't know what you are doing.  If you dislike reading stuff then avoid this game but if you are into this stuff that I described, then I highly recommend this game to you.","May 22","true","12.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

Most of them featured warlocks and demons, so the superhero-themed Appointment With F.E.A.R. really stood out as a unique part of the series.\n\nYou begin the game by choosing your hero's superpower, look, and name. There aren't a huge number of options to choose from - only four powers, ten faces per power, a range of colour choices, and randomised names - but from that point on, you'll be bombarded with a crazy range of equally crazy superhero crises, all day, everyday.\n\nYou'll face a series of tough choices  every few minutes  ("Do I apprehend a mad poisoner, or rescue a public pool from the Ice Queen?" "Rescue a kitten or stop a chainsaw massacre?"). These scenarios will play out very differently depending on your choice of powers, as well as clues you may have found along the way.  Logic can help you a lot of the time, but other times you'll just have to rely on dumb luck. There's some basic fighting involved, and your victories will reward you with collectable cards and high-score-related victory points. Also quips. Quips are fun.\n\nStill, preventing street crime alone won't save the city - you need to carefully navitage each of these situations if you hope to gather enough information to stop F.E.A.R.'s grand plot. Be warned, this isn't an easy gamebook. I've replayed the game around five times without getting close to success, and the game's backtracking options haven't helped me much either.\n\nSo...is it worth $6?\nThat totally depends on whether or not you like choose-your-own-adventure gamebooks. I *loved* this series as a kid, so it was an instant purchase for me. If you're unfamiliar with the series, well, it's a neat distraction. You can easily kill a few hours trying to navigate this game's labyrinthine crimesprees, and the sheer variety of events keeps things replayable for a while.\n\nNow excuse me, my Professor Amazing has accidentally killed another civillian with his Energy Blasts, and I should probably flip back a few pages...","August 27, 2014","true","3.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Unfortunately I ran into a few problems during my second play-through, but I still really like this game.\n- You can't stop every crime, catch every villain or save everyone, some choices are very amusing while others are tragic\n- As well as subduing run of the mill villains you need to investigate and gather clues in an attempt foil a plot to assassinate the president and save the world\n\nhttp://youtu.be/qf3waAR44EY\nhttp://youtu.be/RuV47H0cpWE\nAppointment with F.E.A.R. - part 1 (first impressions review)\nSo in my first play through I was 'The Streaker'. you are given the choice of randomly generated names and I thought this one was perfect! You also have the choice of four different powers, I chose strength and flight. Although there were active alerts on my 'crime-watch' I took my time leaving my apartment on my first day to finish my coffee and make sure that my suit was looking nice. I decided that make the most amusing choices possible during this play-through whether or not that would make me good hero or not.\n-----The game spans three days and each day you set out to work. You of course have a day job as a reporter and your alter-ego is quite mild mannered. You're always late to work and your boss is constantly yelling at you.\n-----Every time you walk down the street, take the train to work etc. you always run into an incidents such as a crime in progress in citizens in dire need of assistance. You have series of choices of what to investigate at each location. For example the commotion of beeping cars in the street where you will notice a car chase or ignore the beeping and instead purchase a newspaper for news or clues about crimes. At the same time your crime-watch usually alerts you to something else. You have to choose what to investigate or deal with, you have no choice but to allow some crimes and incidents to go happen in order to stop others.\n-----If it is a villain you engage you will be put into combat with them. You have a limited amount of stamina points which basically function as health. You exchange attacks with the villain until one of you is defeated. When it is your turn you have the choice of three attacks each does consecutively more damage and is more likely to fail. So there's a little bit of strategy to combat i.e. take most of their stamina with a strong attack then finish them off easily with a weak attack. I never lost a battle. But I think that was because I always chose strength as my power and so had a lot of stamina.\n-----If you deal with an incident you need to make the right choices in order to save the victims. If you hesitate or make the wrong choice you can fail to save everyone. For example I investigated a giant shark that was terrorizing swimmers at a beach. You are actually given the choice to tell swimmers that it's not a shark but just a school of bluefish, which I'm sure wouldn't have turned out well if I'd tried that. Instead I thought I did the right thing by making sure that everyone got out of the water instead of flying towards the shark. However a boy was caught and horrifically eaten by the shark. My hero basically slunk away in shame.\n-----Also after defeating villains in combat you usually have the option to allow them to go free instead of handing them in to the authorities. Sometimes you do this in exchange for clues. It was amusing to allow the chainsaw wielding Bronski free who immediately starts his chainsaw, laughs maniacally and runs off the down the street waving his chainsaw around. But when I defeated the assassin I decided to allow him to go free, unfortunately as soon as I did that he took his gun and shot the president, whoops! I felt pretty bad about that.\n-----Some incidents cannot be stopped without the right clues. You cannot prevent the president's death or know the location of F.E.A.R.'s meeting which you instructed that you must find at the start of the game. I basically failed the game both times I played it through. Although I tried to play seriously during the second play-through and I actually found the clues I needed. For some reason towards the end they disappeared from list of clues. I'm not sure what happened. So the last half an hour or so I was basically playing towards an inevitable failure which was disappointing.\n-----The game is short but it has re-playability value. For one to be able to achieve a positive ending if you failed like I did. Some of the things were the same on the second play-through. But in a lot of cases you make different choices for an alternate experience.\n\n-----I think the game looks quite good. It has some very nice artwork and interesting characters. There is minimal animation, sometimes panels shake and text in combat such as 'KA-THUUUUUUNK!' have some colorful special effects.\n-----You can make some very silly choices and the costume of my character's alter ego consisted of the exact same caped tights clad action hero only donning a large pair of spectacles and a fedora. So initially the game seemed like it would be pretty amusing, it was sometimes even later. But it wasn't really lighthearted as I first expected, with people dying bloody deaths and so on.\n-----The game also rawards you with trading cards. Not steam trading cards. Your collection only seems to exist with the game itself. You gain a random trading card at the end of events such as the defeat of a villain in combat. You can also expend luck points that you accumulate to raise your chances of finding rare cards. You would need to play through the game several times in order to collect all the cards.\n\nIt was a bit depressing that I failed to save the president and the world on my second play-through. I think something may have gone wrong somewhere with the game somewhere to erase my clues. Bar that I enjoyed this game and I think it's quite good. It was worth waiting a few extra hours for it to become available this morning, instead of playing something else.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 26, 2014","true","6.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You cannot control what happens to your character at all. You cannot go where you want to go, but only where the game currently allows you to go. Using you super powers doesn't work half of the time because - reasons?\n\nYou collect clues on your way through the adventures, which looks great at first. Until you realize that those clues are just there for looks, because you cannot use them when you need to. This is either a bug or terrible UI design.\n\nThe comic book style looks great at first, but it's just clunky and clicking through the dialog quickly becomes a chore.\n\nOn my third playthrough I used a walkthrough, but because it was intended for the physical book it asked me to use clues where I couldn't on the PC version. I won't bother to try again\n\nPros:\n- Nice comic book look.\n- The writing is ok.\n\nCons:\n- Terrible UI\n- You play the worst superhero ever.\n- You cannot guess the right options unless you already know what will happen.\n- Randomizing is unclear - what are my chances of succeeding in a fight?

I have been very fond of the Tin Man Digital versions and I rather liked the Over-the-top Comic style that they did for this book/game.\n\nThe music is repetitive but really nice. Love the BIFF BAM sound effects, I was starting to hear Adam West narrate the dialogue after a while.\n\nOverall I think it's a solid fun game. Very unforgiving and I think an easy "hint" mode would have been better than the rewind/check point system.\n\nThe name generator for your hero/heroine is hilarious yet terrible. A shame it couldn't be The Silver Crusader. I would reccomend the game but not at $10 so perhaps over the sales. But a lot of fun if you played/read the old FF series. If you didn't and like the 1950s/60s Silver Age of comics I think it's worth your time.","December 14, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a total waste of your time. You would be far better off investing in a "Choice of" game instead; they are cheaper, better written, and far more entertaining.","June 28, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your superhero will often not fullfill his job. There are MANY paths to choose from which results in great replayability. Each time you can't defeat FEAR you just want to try it again, often resulting in another failure and so on. It's very difficult to find all the required clues in one go and you will often have only one at the eventual end (where you automatically lose). Even I haven't found ANY way to stop Fear yet (and I played it for 4 full hours (each round doesn't take that long)).\n\nBUT don't despair. There are enough guides which can help you if you're really hopeless. And don't think you can't enjoy the game without winning. There are many funny choices (often resulting in achievements) and the combat (yes, you can fight in this game!) is very cool and it even has a very epic soundtrack.\n\nConclusion: It's very challenging, but you will enjoy this game, no matter if you win or lose.\n\n7.3/10","August 24, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm really surprised with all the mixed reviews here. Yes, it can be quite challenging to unlock all the achievements or even successfully finish the game, but that's part of its charm. It has a nice art and a very branching story (with many, let's say "sidequests") abundant with superhero genre cliches. All in all a very fun experience.","August 7, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
