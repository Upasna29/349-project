Usually you like them or you hate them, but they are very alike. This one combines gaming and music. That is exactly what I Iove!

The game in it's current state is not "amazing", but considering this just came out in Early Access I can see it getting a lot better later on.\n\n","February 25","true","8.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

It's still very buggy, to the point that the whole game freezes up.  The "enemies", pop music freaks seem a little strong for your inital round of towers.  Also, the game is "Rock and Roll" defense, not heavy metal screaming music, which is what I have heard each time I try to play.  Right now, I may only have 5 minutes of time recorded, but that's including the times the game just froze up completely.  If the bugs get fixed, this has the possibility of being a decent game.","May 1","false","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

At the current state it looks and plays like one of those free flash TD. I actually hoped that music is somehow involved in the gameplay, but it isn't. Let's hope that one day it will become a good one.","May 26","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
