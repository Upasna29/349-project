I enjoyed the first game immensely, but I knew how broken and bug filled the game was. But the developers have really worked hard because dang, this game is great. It looks ten times better, runs ten times smoother, and best of all, I have not encountered a single bug. Although I played through the original twice already, this one still feels like a fresh new game. They really did an amazing job at making an already fun game into something brilliant. However, the AI is still kind of dumb for the most part. Other than that I am beyond impressed as to how much this game has changed. For $8 you'll be getting a solid single-player or co-op experience. I guarantee it. Plus the multi-player is really engaging and just an awesome time. I would totally buy this again. So do yourself a favor and purchase this game. I know you will have a great time.","April 2, 2014","true","8.6"," 107 of 132 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","107","132","0","2"

This came as a surprise! :O\n\nIt kind of feels like a mix of action between Aliens and Mass Effect.\nThe reason I say that is because of the way the characters play out is similar to the game play in Mass Effect and also having biotic albilities like bringing up a force Shield and pulsing out a Shield Blast.\nAnd when I mention it feels like Aliens, well you will see when you get swarmed by countless Alien creatures dashing, jumping, running along walls and ceilings to get you, and hearing them screech when they die or about to attack. It's pretty creepy.\n\nYour fellow AI team is actually very helpful and do their best to wipe out the enemy, ducking for cover, blind firing, throwing well timed grenades, focusing on saving your life when you are down and also not getting killed at the same time. That's pretty impressive because it makes you feel that they are needed and not just in the way. Also just like in Mass Effect, you can give orders to each individual team mate to move, get cover, attack a certain area or even focus on a single or multiple enemies.\n\nThe enemy AI is not bad either. You will find a good challenge against them as they run for cover, peek fire, blind fire, throw well timed and positioned grenades and even try to flank you. It's total chaotic fun between you and your AI team against the AI enemy. Trust me you will be running out of ammo a lot. So make sure to take advantage of your abilities as well because the enemy has a pretty accurate shot too. :) But if you really want to have fun then try playing this game Co-op. It's insane! :D\n\nIf you like sci-fi games that remind you of Mass Effect and Aliens then give this one a try, and for the low price, it's a steal.","April 2, 2014","true","6.9"," 71 of 93 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","71","93","0","0"

There's the "two weapons and grenade" weapon style that has become standard, and none of the weapons so far have been anything besides standard style.\n\nEnemies are dull design wise but smart enough to blind fire from cover, charge when in groups and take cover or hide from you if you're advancing.\n\nSquad AI isn't the best but they've never actively hindered me and if I do get downed they're quick enough to pick me up without putting themselves in danger.\n\nThe voice acting is okay, it's very 80s action movie so if that's your kind of thing you're in for a treat.\n\nGraphics are servicable I can tell what things are even if textures can be a bit muddied.\n\nAlso the game was free because of owning the original episodes now pulled from Steam so the devs are really cool.","April 2, 2014","true","4.3"," 44 of 56 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","44","56","0","0"

What I like the most is its intense gameplay and  replayability. It's what in my opinion a VIDEOGAME has to be, no more, no less.\n\nTrust me, once you get the grasp of the special abilities and how to properly use the enhancements you get by leveling up your character, the overall experience is just great.\n\nFor those saying it's like Mass Effect, Gears Of War, etc, well, that's a lax and vague statement. Yes, it has features seen on GOW and Mass Effect like 3rd person view, firing from cover or checkpoint based maps, but saying it's a clone of a game just because it includes GAME GENRE  or GAME CATEGORY mechanincs is just stupid. It's like saying Call Of Duty, Battlefield, or Killzone series are clones of.... eeerm.... DOOM? Because they belong to the FPS category??  If you love 3rd person shooters, you'll love this game too, it's that simple.\n\n\nPROS:\n\n- Co-op campaign mode (even better with friends on max. difficulty).\n- Lots of scenarios and special events.\n- The intensity in the action of some chapters.\n- High replayability: Once you beat the game, you'll love to replay it with what you have learnt.\n- Great XP perk system.\n- "Shade", one of the playable characters... he's just so cool\n- Sniping!\n\nCONS:\n\n- Some enemies are too hard to beat down and this can get a bit frustrating at the beginning.\n- Hard to find pvp games\n- Could've had more remarkable differences among characters' abilities.\n- There are moments in the campaign where the voice of Reisebeck telling you what to do next gets really annoying (he just won't shut up...)\n\n\nMy advice?

You can't easily get Gears of War on PC so this is the next best thing.\n\nProblem is, it still has a long way to go. Guns feel weak because enemies are Gears style bullet sponges and guns have Gears style spray patterns, and some of this feels Gears-style just because that's what the devs loved and wanted to emulate. The shotgun may as well be a confetti cannon.\n\nI can see where this might be fun in co-op, and it's not especially bad otherwise, but it just does not excite me. For $7 worth of Unreal Engine shooting, you can have a good time, but I have so much trouble picking this over other decent TPSes.\n\nAll that said, I DO commend this game for not wasting your time. Precious little of it is scripted. It is quick to funnel you from room to room and give you loads of things to shoot. Very few other Gears-style shooters really have this focus, instead throwing QTEs and cutscenes and slow-walking segments at you and too much other boring crap.\n\nIt is not quite fun enough for me to recommend, sadly, but it is still good enough that it is worth playing if you come across it or crave some co-op TPS action.","April 2, 2014","false","2.1"," 55 of 87 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","55","87","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/227560/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","Dear God do not play this alone. I'd even say ever, but I did not play this in Co-Op, so there you go.\n\nNo, really, the reason I start out this review this way is to glaringly point out how not only incapable but absolutely TERRIBLE the teammate AI is in this game.\n\nThere are games, such as RE5, where the AI can be made to function well enough given some adjustments. (in that case, give Sheva a bolt action rifle and suddenly she's a bullet preserving aiming goddess...)\nScourge's teammate AI has absolutely NOTHING to redeem itself. I know I'm beating on a dead horse here, but allow me to point out from what aspects the AI is absolutely failing.\n\n- The AI often fails to spot an enemy, even if it's blatantly attacking them. This becomes blatantly obvious when the small alien critters come into play. They'll crawl next to your teammates, take a moment before leaping with their overpowered attack (get hit twice by it = down) and take out your entire team. That skill of theirs has no CD but it's impossible to miss. And the AI... just glares at it. It takes one actual downing before they'll even know it's there!\n\nIn other words, the AI is blissfully unaware of it's surroundings until its almost too late to react on it. This changes when they are in cover. In fact, when in combat with other humanoids toting guns, your teammates are well capable if you babysit their positioning. Because if you don't... ohhh boy, they'll take cover in terrible angles (exposing themselves) and run from cover to cover just because their AI can't decide.\n\nSo a part of the game is against armed humanoids. You got your positioning worked out, you place the markers for your teammates...\n\n- And the teammates don't always listen to your commands. You'll place a marker in one spot, and they'll take cover behind something you KNOW you did not intend for them to hide behind. Usually it's okay, cover is cover. But the game likes to throw enemies BEHIND you from time to time. So if your teammates don't listen to your planning, which would've accounted for this...\n\nWell, then there's lots of reviving to be had, speaking of which...\n\n- Your teammates are pretty incapable of being smart regarding Reviving. Let's bring the example of earlier back. A small alien critter has taken down a teammate. What would a smart AI decision be? Take down the critter, then help your teammate up.\nWhat do your teammates do? They go straight to reviving. Even if the same enemy is still right besides the downed teammate. In fact, any teammates that are not busy reviving will not AID the teammate coming to the rescue. No, they'll just... Mind their own business. It's really quite dreadful.\n\nThe one thing the AI does 'sort of' okay, is using their shield skill in tandem with reviving. Sometimes they use it when needed, sometimes they don't (while they really should). Stonewall in particular has a shield he can keep up while reviving, so he's usually assigned as the designated reviver... or at least, so in my mind. There's no actual mechanic to assign him to this role, because...\n\n- All you can do with your teammates is point at something for them. Luckily there's a way to pick WHO does what, but in general the only interaction you can do is keep your mouse on something, and context will decide WHAT they'll do. Unless it's a wall. A wall does not mean 'go there' for them. It just doesn't work. You need to point at the actual floor. Which makes pushing up a pair of stairs an absolute hoot.\n\nSo, let's summarize. Your teammates are terrible at shooting at enemies unless nobody is downed and they're not downed immediately themselves. They're pretty suicidal when it comes to reviving and there's little you can do to guide them other than force them at a spot, where they have free reign to decide what cover to use, and not the cover you meticulously picked as ideal for them. Got that? Alright, up to the next set of issues.\n\nThe Gameplay itself is... clumsy? I can't think of anything better. The guns that are not meant to be super strong, are super weak. The pistol is useless unless scoring headshots, and the Firefly (the Assault RIfle class, apparently) feels like a BB gun. Shoots fast and takes too long to damage anything, let alone kill even the weakest of things. The Raptor is a burst fire rifle with good enough DPS, and the shotgun is instakill at point blank and useless at any range beyond that. We're talking "right up in your face" range. No exaggeration.\n\nFor most of them, usage just does not feel good. And when the animation quality is laughable (just look at AMP sprinting, it's hilarious) it just doesn't help when the characters are absolutely boring as well.\n\nStonewall is what I assume the leader. He has a little bit of a potty mouth and a dumb attitude, Absolutely unlikeable and boring.\nAMP is the female-with-attitude because we certainly haven't seen that before... mind the sarcasm...\n\nMass is... a shotgun toting Scot/Irish/I-can't-even-tell-anymore and absolutely uninteresting.\nAnd Shade... is supposed to be sneaky? But the game doesn't really employ a stealth system so everything about him is... he's sneaky but enemies spot him immediately so... he's just really weak. Not to mention they advertise him using akimbo pistols but so far that doesn't seem to be a feature in the game. Apologies if it does come in later, I kind of gave up after a certain point in this game.\n\nEvery character has an AoE and a shield attack special skill. Largely, they're useless for how resource consuming they are, which only refills at certain tanks found in the game (no auto-regen) and for most characters these AoE's are awkward to aim.\n\nLevel design is in general made for firefights, Even in situations where you're only pitted against Aliens, which CAN and WILL crawl on the walls to maneuver their way around. I have to say, for how stupid your Teammates are, the Enemy AI sure is capable at killing them. Cover tends to mean very little unless you're holed down an actual corridor waiting for an Elevator to arrive.\n\nThe story? I heard some ridiculous leaps in some video games, but this one took the cake right from the start. Also, the tutorial doesn't seem to mention that your AoE (if ranged) has a fixed range. I was stuck in that section for 10 minutes until realizing that.\n\nI have to admit, up until the Aliens arrived, the game was playable as a '♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you could tough through'. But as soon as the critters came into play, only the cheesiest of cheesy tactics can work and not even always then. And, just to remind you, it takes TWO leaps from a mass of small critters to down you. If a teammate goes down, sure, the Player can cover the AI reviving. But if YOU get downed? Forget about it. Prepare for a slow and cringeworthy display of terrible AI that, one by one, come to revive you and find themselves downed by the enemy thats RIGHT BESIDE YOU. It takes actual geography to block an enemy for a revive on you to generally succeed.\n\nSeriously, avoid this game. I know some people love playing games that are terrible, but this one just... it's not fun, not even in a laugh-at-a-bad-game kind of way. The only way this can MIGHT redeem itself is if you have a team of four HUMANS that know what to do in order to properly tough through this game. Forget about it on your own, you'll hate yourself trying to finish it.\n\nCripe almighty.","July 27, 2015","false","5.3"," 30 of 43 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","30","43","4","0"

Well, maybe. Either way, that’s the premise of Scourge: Outbreak, a third person cover-based shooter. While the game doesn’t bring anything new to the genre, it’s a solid offering for the price.The game begins when the player chooses one of four playable characters, each with different attributes. Aside from their differences like weapon stability and stamina, each also has a unique combination of shield and shockwave abilities.The mercenaries are not just here for the paycheck; each one also has a personal stake in this fight, which is revealed during cut scenes throughout play.Right from the start, Scourge plants itself firmly in well-worn territory, and the game play is pretty cookie cutter third person shooter. Players can take cover behind objects, dive to evade attacks and return fire with one of two equipped weapons or the occasional grenade. While there’s nothing especially unique here, everything is executed well, with the exception of some minor control annoyances.Obstacles can be hurdled but only from cover, meaning if I was running along and a box was in the way, I would have to stop, get in cover and then jump over it.XP is awarded for kills and other actions throughout the game, and is organized into four categories. Leveling up a category will unlock perks specific to that style of play. While there is a single player game, at its heart Scourge is really a four player co-op game with bots. Even when playing by myself levels would end with a score screen showing each character’s kills, revives and other stats. Fortunately, my AI teammates were solid, and well designed. Playing co-op online works well and runs smoothly, with the exception of some frame rate issues. Scourge’s multiplayer can certainly be fun, but players should plan on bringing a friend along, as finding someone to play with will prove difficult.The major downside about the game is the lack of community behind it. Aside from mouths not matching in-game dialogue, the character models themselves are pretty well done.The maps and stages throughout the game get some decent shine as well. It’s evident that the developers took a little time to make the planet of Nagori a captivating one.Scourge: Outbreak is a solid game, either single player or co-op.Overall 6/10.","December 1, 2014","true","9.2"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","23","33","0","0"

There are ammo boxes, but they're usually limited to one ammo type.\n- I crashed several times during the playthrough. Minimizing the game or getting a popup seems to a guaranteed way to crash.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WirelessPillow/recommended/227560/","WirelessPillow","WirelessPillow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WirelessPillow/","933 products in account","Scourge: Outbreak is a headache-inducing third-person co-op shooter designed for four players. The game features terrible gun-play, poorly implemented powers, terrible game-play mechanics, bad voice acting, and strange level designs.\n\n\nBeing a shooter, the game revolves heavily around gun play, its a shame than that this game falls short on pretty much every aspect of the gun play. The game has plenty of guns to offer, but due to every enemy essentially being a bullet sponge, including the very first grunts of the game, most weapons are either useless or only useful in set situations. Limiting players to only two guns at a time discourages experimentation since the risk of doing so is punished by encountering bullet-sponge enemies. Shotguns have an astoundingly short range and snipers cannot kill anything in one hit by the time you get them which makes the shotgun highly situational and the sniper essentially useless. Grenades have no throwing arc and the result is guess work when trying to hit specific targets at any distance, a tedious affair when grenades are required to kill something. One of the essential parts of being a shooter, the placing of bullets into enemies, is one of this game's weakest attributes.\n\n\nThe powers that the four main characters receive in the game end up feeling more than a little disappointing when you get them, primarily due to an antagonist's teleportation powers being the teaser to your personal powers. Each person is supposed to end up with different powers, according to the voice over, but what ends up happening is that each character has different versions of ground blast and shield. Ground blast is only useful near enemies, with the exception of Amp who can somehow throw her blasts like magic grenades, and shield is fantastic since it lets you not die when reviving allies that will inevitable fall due to lack of cover or the AI running into the open. All of this is only possible if you have enough Ambrosia, which you only get from green barrels of goo that explode if shot, meaning you could end up without a source of energy and as a result, no powers. Overall the powers are neat in concept, but you likely wouldn't miss them if they were removed.\n\n\nThe mechanics and concepts in the game show that inspiration has been taken from several shooters, most notably the cover system taken straight from Gears of War. A problem that arises from this is the implementation of most of these ideas are done terribly or simply aren't designed well. The cover system doesn't work well if you don't include the cover to go with it, or the ability to use your guns properly from cover. The result is that most enemies behave in such a way that locking to cover is detrimental to the game-play experience and likely to get you killed unless there is no way to be flanked. Worse is the alien enemies that have to melee you to hurt you, making cover a dangerous affair. It is strange then that the aliens are introduced in a cramped corridor with nearly infinite amounts until you kill the lead aliens. For a single player this section is virtually impassable as the AI can't cope with the amount of enemies and reviving the player at the same time. The strangest part of the introductory area of the aliens belongs to the end of it, where you have to defend against a rush of them while a door is on a timer to open. During the defense there are defenses on the wall helping you hold them off, giving you time to fight the aliens without getting swarmed while still feeling as if you will. These strange decisions continue to appear in later stages, such as a boss you can't kill unless you remove barrels of Ambrosia that are healing him after a certain damage threshold. Those are the very same barrels used to regenerate your own powers so by destroying them, you lose your powers shortly after receiving them. Another boss requires you to throw grenades at specific parts from a distance, which is immensely tedious without a throwing arc and should not have been included without a useful launcher of some kind. The game could have benefited greatly with fewer but more focused mechanics, but opted for more is greater.\n\n\nThe voice acting in Scourge: Outbreak is not so much terrible as it is inconsistent, such as the lead character having an accent constantly change from sentence to sentence and occasionally in the middle of speaking. It sounds like they had multiple voice actors and forgot to decide on a specific actor. Other examples are lines delivered from antagonist's that often sound unrehearsed or as if the reader is perplexed by the writing. The result is an inconsistent delivery of vocal work that ends up jarring and pulls you out of the games world.\n\n\nThe level designs used in this game seemed to vary between corridors and big open rooms, with corridors taking the stage the majority of the time. One area of the game has you wait in a corridor while the game scans the protagonists, the door than opens to another corridor that leads to a cut-scene.  Corridors leading into corridors appears to be their way of slowing the pace down after combat; it's a poor method since there is no sense of progression, just going from fight to fight. Some sections have what appears to be water slowing you down, though as it is walked through, it moves away from the player as if jumping in a gelatinous substance. Having the character slow down in water is unnecessary, especially in rooms that have nothing in them which is always the case. Sadly most levels are poorly designed, either with too much cover, making it detrimental in the search of enemies, or too little cover, making it hard to survive the enemy's onslaught.\n\n\nThis game is not recommended, even on a budget due to many frustrating moments and poor enemy design. The game is pretty much unplayable alone and renders you powerless when in a group since there is a lack of Ambrosia. I recommend not buying this game at any price.","December 8, 2014","false","4.5"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

I've had instances of AI companions trying to heal me by running in front of an enemy turret. Enemies are made to soak up bullets making for unsatisfying gunplay and have the added bonus of infinite grenade spam. Pouring thirty rounds into an enemy only to see it jump and incapacitate my character left me unimpressed. In some cases I could fire 200 rounds into an enemy and not kill it. Possibly, that specific enemy is headshot only.\n\nThis game also has weird balance issues and a lot of jankiness to it. Some of it looks genuinely hilarious like vaulting over cover or the sprinting animation. The balance issues are more frustrating though. The AI has the benefit of having infinite or some regenerating Ambrosia (the stuff for your powers) while players need to stand next to barrels of the liquid. Those barrels can be destroyed, deliberately or on accident which is less than ideal and also less fun.\n\nThere was also this one fight with a second plane where you had to stick grenades to it, but the lack of grenade arcs makes the it frustrating; my friend and I spent a good fifteen minutes just lobbing sticky grenades and sometimes they would make it.\n\nI can't recommend this game for a single player experience. Maybe try the Resident Evils, Just Cause 2, Hitman: Blood Money, Tomb Raider 2013, Sleeping Dogs, the GTAs, or Saints Row IV for a third-person experience. I suppose you could look into Spec Ops: The Line, Binary Domain (some rough boss fights), Inversion (no co-op, possibly bad), or even Dizzel (f2p Early Access multiplayer game) for that more GoW feel.\n\nOtherwise, have friends for Scourge. Do not rely solely on this game's AI. I tried it single player and my team mate's behavior is a constant crap shoot. I highly recommend bringing in at least one friend if you going to play this game. That way, the AI can go around using their infinite ammo and powers while you two actually complete goals. Play with a human, please.\n\nHere's a screenshot of my friend walking through water: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353134313","November 26, 2014","false","8.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

The game isn't that long but its worth the purchase.\n\nFirst, it features a unique story that keeps you trying to figure it out since the beginning of the game. As you continue you will watch surprising cut scenes which give you a bigger picture to the story. The story line ride is que interesting to say the least.\n\nIn terms of game play, it's quite polished. I dont recall many bugs, the graphics and effects looked good, the maps were clean and straight-forward.\n\nAt different points the game slowed down a bit, like when we had to bomb the helicopter to pieces by tossing grenades at it. We thought it would never end and that the devs were playing a cruel joke on us, while watching a live feed of our game play, eating pizza and making fun of us. Long shot but hey, gotta use the imagination dont we? But, it picked up and got a bit more fast paced when encountering hordes of evil brain-washed vermin, or nasty bugs. It was a good balance.\n\nA variety of weapons also kept the game interesting and thrilling, especially when the big boy guns were found. And of course nades-are-nades. Who doesn't like big booms that splatter green alien slime everywhere?\n\nI had a blast, yet enjoyed it more with friends than in single mode - this seems to be shared by the majority of the gaming community. All in all, I think it's is a great game, that will stay fun for a long time.","November 4, 2014","true","14.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Our heroes wield shotguns and assault rifles and crouch behind knee high walls, despite being built like linebackers for some reason. If this sounds familiar to you, then congratulations on your purchase of an Xbox 360 in the previous generation. What we have here is a Gears of War knockoff made with the same quality and care that the Chinese put into every iPid they sell on EBay. The project started light years ago as an episodic title back when you could still release those with a straight face, and Outbreak is a remastered bundle of the two episodes that ended up being made back then.

The campaign's straightforward, but the moot voice acting and somewhat interesting backstory of Amp and Shade keeps it fresh enough.  MP's straightforward as well.  Gameplay's very solid, and unlike most shooters this one gets the traversal aspect down pretty well.  Commanding squads in SP seems to be my only gripe, as your team seems to take minutes to kill off enemies when you could just dominate the map head on (this is even on Nightmare Difficulty.)

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/recommended/227560/","Azundris","Azundris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azundris/","247 products in account","Nice, utilitarian team shooter that gets surprisingly bad reviews.\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nYou're a squad of four (what characters aren't picked up by players are led by the AI). You shoot enemy soldiers and aliens as you infiltrate an evil corporation to exfil an operative and intel. Weaponry is straight forward -- accessible or bland, it's your call -- with pistol, shotgun, AR, SMG, grenades, sniper rifle, minigun, and a kind of alien plasma caster. There is DNA to pick up (today's keycards), the occasional turret to use, and *gasp* door and elevator buttons to push. Your suit has an offensive and a defensive capability depending on your character (neither was of much use or saw any in my case), and there is a cover system. No, you don't talk to people. This isn't Mass Effect, even though the look of some of the weapons and the squad mechanics have been compared to ME's.\n\nTHE GOOD\nThis is retro and derivative in a number of ways, but for a co-op game, especially one with a short campaign, this can be a boon, since it's much easier to talk busy friends into such a limited commitment time- and learning-wise. Run'n'gun, open door, that's easy enough to relate. You get one powerset during the entirety of the game, a variant of shield and one of shockwave, depending on your character. At least for my character, the shield was of little use (costly, can't shoot with it active, breaks down under fire or after a short timeout), and the shockwave of none (I could never get it to work properly on enemies on a different elevation, and aiming had to be so precise to make any damage at all that it simply wasn't worth it. Also, again, two shots before empty, non auto recharging), so it's one less thing to learn (I ended up completing the game pretty much using neither shield nor shockwave).\n\nTHE BAD\nThis is a B-list, indie shooter, and it shows at times -- not all of the voice work is good, for a start. Can we please never do the Scottish-accented braveheart berserker dwarf ever again? Just had that in Borderlands 2, and of course in LotR, and it's really too fresh in my memory to count as "retro." Or, you know, "amusing." Obviously, it's not as varied as Left4Dead (or has A list voice talent like pretty much any of the Valve games), but on the upside, it's not as annoying as Borderlands 2, either.\nSpeaking of recorded lines, the flashbacks they make such a big deal of in the sales pitch are very rudimentary, but I guess you can only do so much in a 7 hour campaign, especially if you don't want to slow it down too much, and there is still a nice, retro, '80ish punchline in the end (for the team, not per character). The powers, as per above, were completely useless for my character; my friend's stationary shield saw some more use (when healing). "Casual" difficulty is quite manageable for the most part, but in some of the final sets, you're swarmed in confined space, and I ended up spending an annoying amount of time on the ground -- not my idea of "casual", but you might be luckier (or, you know, simply better at it, or more awake).\nAlso, cover system. OK, I know that every time there is a cover system, I comment on how they're usually more trouble than they're worth, and how if I want cover, I'll stand or crouch behind something, according to the amount of cover I want. So let's get to the specifics. First off, I think a cover system is especially ill-advised in something that's otherwise stripped down, and tries to be retro -- this makes it harder to draw in other casual players (win them on "only 7 hours", lose them on "you'd better play the tutorial before joining"). The system they provide is "press button to take cover, simply move away from it at will", which at least is less annoying than auto cover that simply sucks you in against your will and then remains sticky, but on the default controller layout, the cover button "(A)" is shared with roll "(A)" and sprint "hold-(A)", so it's not quite as simple as "if you don't like cover, avoid the button altogether." On the upside, there are some moves where you slide into cover that are fun to watch. On the downside, /rolling/ into cover looks funky and is a bit loud. Also on the downside, the cover system and the crouch mechanic seem to interefere with each other pretty often; arguably one should go. Finally, on the controller, "sprint" defaults to being on a button, which is a bit cumbersome.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nOutside of the cover system, this felt strangely a bit like the original Doom with updated graphics (and that wasn't even co-op), which is a good thing in my book. Basic weaponry in few variants (most guns come in only one version, some come in normal/stabilized/accurate, but in the end, it matters little). Traverse a futuristic station, shoot stuff, pick up keycards, lather, rinse, repeat. '80s type nihilistic setting. The session broke once or twice for our team, but if nothing else, a checkpoint is never too far away. This is an enjoyable little game that was far from being as flawed as many reviews led me to believe; it's not innovative, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in a short campaign and with casual gamers. If you're between co-op games and can get this for a decent price, go for it, as long as you're aware of what the game is and isn't.","April 9, 2014","false","10.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/227560/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","TLDR: Third person shooter similar in combat to Mass Effect, but with the RPG elements removed. It’s built for 4 person Co-op so you can play through the campaign with your friends. Overall decent game, but not ground-breaking in any way.   6.5/10\n\nScourge Outbreak was a bundled game that I never heard of until about a month ago and it doesn’t have much in the way of positive word of mouth. It’s apparently a follow up to another Scourge game which failed miserably, but I haven’t played that one and I followed the story line for Outbreak just fine.  I gave the game a try because I enjoy shooter games, especially the kind that you can play the campaign mode in co-op with friends.\n\nAccording the to the game’s intro story, in the not too distant future the world is pretty much under the thumb of a powerful corporation named Nogari who controls the world’s energy. Very similar to Cell corporation in Crysis 3. The “energy” in question is something called Ambrosia, which is some kind of revolutionary power source like the “mass effect” in the Mass Effect games (in other words, think of it as magic energy that can do anything). You play a member of a 4 man commando team working to bring down Nogari by infiltrating one of their installations and uncovering proof of their evil ways, specifically, the link between Ambrosia and the alien Scourge. The whole game is this one mission and Nogari’s extensive security forces will be your main enemies. The rest are various Scourge aliens.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the gameplay is Third Person Shooter with some cover mechanics, and one thing to note is that even on easy/normal difficulty the enemies have a lot of health. It takes more shots than you might expect to kill anyone, including the grunt enemies. There aren’t that many weapons to choose from, but you can find a few modified versions of each one (+damage, +accuracy, +stability, etc.). You don’t get to customize the weapons, you just occasionally find different versions. Each of the 4 playable characters is supposedly better with a particular weapon (faster reload) though truthfully it’s barely noticeable.\n\nThe gimmick in this game, the thing that gives you an advantage over your enemies are your 2 Ambrosia power “spells.” You can cast an energy shield or an energy shockwave, both powered by the Ambrosia fuel cells that you find laying around in the levels. Each of the 4 characters has a different combination of the 2 Ambrosia power types (mobile/stationary shield, area/forward shockwave) but the difference isn’t very pronounced. Don’t go into the game expecting the 4 characters to be wildly different. There is a sort of level up system going on in the background that gives you passive bonuses, independent of which character you play. It’s hardly noticeable during the game, but by the end you’ll be significantly stronger. It’s kind of like the Killing Floor 1 upgrade system in that you level up by performing specific action types (headshots, reviving allies, etc.)\n\nPros:\n+Decent graphics without really heating up my video card. I was concerned that the game stuttered in certain places but I now believe this was due to the Steam “steamwebhelper” bug going on in the background because the low frame rate disappeared when Steam fixed their bug.\n+OK story though it’s not particularly clever. You can play through the main story campaign in 4 player co-op, which is always a plus. Like most squad based games, you can revive your allies if they’re incapacitated.\n+There are a few boss fights (Giant Aliens!), which shake up the gameplay a little.\n\nCons:\n-The game’s controls feel clunky at times, especially related to finding cover.\n-The enemies seem to have too much health, especially the Scourge. Even the little dog-sized Scourge seem to take a full clip of ammo to kill.\n-The Ambrosia powers are kind of lackluster, and not just because you only have 2 powers. It’s similar in concept to the guns in Dead Island, because the “ammo” supply is just scarce enough that you don’t want to use it in normal situations (might need it later) but in reality the “ammo” is found all over the place. I think it would have been better if your Ambrosia meter regenerated itself instead of needing to resupply from the fuel cells that you find scattered on the ground.\n\nAll in all, if you enjoyed the combat portion of the Mass Effect games (not the RPG parts) or other third person shooters (Spec Ops: The Line, Inversion, Gears of War) you may want to give Scourge Outbreak a try. It should take you about 10 hours to beat.\n","May 20, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'd actually played it for a few minutes, or at least tried to through a steam share and it kept crashing. So... I uninstalled it and had given up.\n\nFast forward to much more recently, and I've now played through the normal difficulty co-op campaign and... I really can't help but recommend it at any cost. You can usually find Scourge:Outbreak in bundles, but I've seen it on sale on steam, so either way, give it a try. It's also got a demo if you're not comfortable picking it up without giving it a try.\n\nWhat can I say about it... I mean, it seems kind of basic at first glance, your weapons feel rather weak compared to your enemy health and well, some of the abilities are a little underwhelming, and yet it's got this kind of charm I never really thought would hit me this hard. And yet, despite everything the system of leveling up in different categories, fighting through hordes of enemies and watching unique cutscenes for each character makes it a very fun co-op experience.\n\nSo yes... Grab this game as soon as you can, it's worth every penny, especially if you're playing with a friend.","March 2, 2015","true","22.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is by no means the worst game i have played but does not deliver on most (if not all) aspects.\n\nOne of the things that bugged me the most is the fact that the AI is horrible but the game "compensates" this by making them really powerfull. You can send your other 3 squaddies to a fortified enemy position and they will obliterate everything without taking too much damage, you try to do the same: you blast 1 guy 3 times in the head with a shotgun at 5 meters distance and he is still standing while you get hit by an assaultrifle that leaves you bleeding all over the floor in less than a second. At least you immortal squaddies will revive you!\n\nOne of the perfect situations to show how strong the NPCs are is that it takes a clean headshot with a bolt action .50 sniper rifle on an unarmored enemy to kill him.\n\nAlthough the game is horribly unbalanced, uninspired and has a ton of faults it is somewhat fun to play with friends. I would recommend other games that do this type of gameplay much better.","February 16, 2015","false","9.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The difference between the characters go beyond they way they can protect themselves or others, you can feel it if you're carrying a heavy weapon with Mass or AMP for example.\n\nPlease, do buy this game!

The game is not bad but its just kind of dull after awhile. The story is pretty generic and then it tries to add a twist at the end. Its a really bad way to tell the story. We know throughout the game that things aren't as they seem but then to just puke out information for two minutes at the end isn't good story telling. You could tell they had some good ideas and maybe wanted to tell more but the execution was poor. The ending tries to leave you on a cliffhanger but all it feels is like a waste of time.\n\nYou are going to spend a lot of time running around and shooting stuff and the combat never really feels that satisfying. There are a few weapons that are fun to use later on in the game but the same four you end up using for most of the game are just unexiciting. It just goes back to that dull feeling, especially with the shotgun.\n\nHonestly, there is just no good reason to spend money on it. You are better off spending your money, your time, and three of your friends time playing something else.","April 10, 2014","false","6.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

They knew that they will not make a lot of money on this game, they knew that the first Scourge wasn't a very good game, still they fixed most of the bad things, redesigned the levels, added more features (I really like the XP and skills system), improved pretty much anything, for instance the enemy AI (they really are pain in the ♥♥♥ since the half of the game!), shooting and cover system. They even gave away this game for free for everyone who owns the first Scourge.\n\nAnd that's why this game is worth a shot. Yes, it is a generic Gears of War clone with Mass Effect elements. Yes, the low budget is visible in every inch of the game, and yes, it still needs some fixes. But as I said - developers really CARE about the players, unlike pretty much every single one of the BIG companies, so I guess such rarity deserves some support from us ;)\n\nAnd with such positive attitude, energy and enthusiasm I hope they'll make it big some day.\n\nThanks for your time and effort, guys!

There are parts of the single player where you die and still get passed on to the next area, some of the voice overs are cheesy, and the Hispanic voice actor is laughable.\nDespite this games flaws, there is still a lot to like about this game.

If you're into the aesthetic then it is definitely worth playing. This applies ESPECIALLY if you played the first version of the game ("Scourge Project: Episodes 1 &2") but found it a bit disapointing. They reworked the controls, adding things like rolling and a smoother cover system. The textures remain bad but they added lots of visual effects which make the gunfights pretty intense.\n\nThe character XP and perk system is more intuitive and is better explained to you know, and is accessible even without being online. Oh, and the Gamespy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t has been removed from the game meaning multiplayer is possible again.\n\nThe levels are pleasantly bright and colorfull now which goes a long way towards making the game feel less like a cheap Gears of War knock-off.\n\nThe best part is the way they added a lot of little story moments which make the playable characters a lot more fleshed out. For instance: the tutorial mission starts with a little cutscene unique to whichever character you're playing as that shows you a lot about their personality in less than a minute.\n\nThe devs took a disapointing game and fleshed it out so that now it lives up to most of what I wanted from it originally.","April 4, 2014","true","0.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

As a modern shooter it still doesn't hit the target in terms of graphics and the conrols can be very unwieldy indeed. It doesn't help that if you have a gamepad installed all instructions of how and what to do will appear as gamepad mechanics whether you are using keyboard or not. It is a far better game to play using M+Kbd as targetting with the right stick is fairly jerky and inaccurate in comparison. If you are interested in co-op shooters this may be worth a look but as a single player experience it remains dated and flawed despite the much appreciated gesture of making it free to owners of the original.

The campaign can be played solo or with up to three other players.\n\nI beat this game back when it was called "The Scourge Project."  That title is gone from the Steam Store now, and this new game sits in previous buyers' libraries, effectively erasing our play time.  The re-release adds some Dx11 effects and a few minor clean-ups here and there.  It's ultimately the same game, though.\n\nThe story is passable, but it takes the back seat.  Some of the voice actors are good, most are not-so-amazing.  There's a touch of character development, delivered in flashbacks, throughout the campaign - which is kind of neat considering it begs multiple playthroughs to learn the true background of all four playable characters.\nBack when it was originally released a year or two ago, I took around nine hours to beat the campaign once (one character) because I tend to drag my butt and stare at everything.  I think average for one campaign solo should be closer to seven hours.\n\nThis title focuses on action and cover-based shooting mechanics.\nIs it as solid-feeling as Gears of War?  No.\nIs the story as good as GoW?

I only played this game for a little under two hours and I know I should give it more time but I honestly can't. When I got two copies I thought it just be a fun game for me to play with my friend since we were having some trouble finding co-op games to play. Our options were pretty limited because I have a computer built for gaming and she has a laptop that can handle plenty of games but not a lot of new big name titles or older ones for that matter. I found the game to be functional if a little dry and overdone. I know a lot of people don't like the third-person covered based shooting concept that's gotten into a a lot of games these days. I honestly don't have that much of a problem with it because most games that do it find at least one mechanic that makes a little unique. This game didn't really find that unique point, and although I'm not sure what they could have done, it still makes the gameplay bland. Still in the time we played I was having fun. There's always a lot of baddies to shoot and that's always fun. But the powers each character has aren't that interesting and are at times kind of hard to use, at least in my experience. I can appreciate that they tried to make the story aspect compelling and it wasn't too bad for a game like this. It was simple, I didn't have any trouble following it, and it wasn't that silly or ridiculous. Still, pretty dry though. What killed the game for me is the voice acting. It is absolutely horrible. Combine that with the fact that the personality and backstory they tried to add to each character was never seen in gameplay that well and confined to a text box, it was impossible to relate to them or find them the slightest bit appealing. In terms of graphics, I also found it boring. The enviornments are akin to that of many 4 player co-op games I've played like Borderlands 1 & 2 and the character design is just...awful. The four leads are some of the ugliest main characters I've seen in gaming. That's my detailed analysis though. In my broad opinion if you're looking for something simple and shooty to pass some time with after exhausting all of your other co-op options, give it a go, but I can't recommend it as a co-op game that's engaging, can make each player feel like they can relate to their character, find an identity, and invest a lot of time into.","September 26, 2015","false","1.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I can see why this was given away for free. Awful AI, bad map design, and bullet sponge enemies that can knock you down in seconds.  For a shooter, the shooting mechanics are bland and forgettable and this game has the worst shotgun of any game ever.\n\nYour team AI spend more time running in and out of cover or getting lost on the map, than helping.\n\nAlso the game is checkpoint based, and the checkpoints are often badly placed. Basically to pad out the short gametime.   Average voice acting and subpar gunfire sounds rounds out the list of fail.\n\nOnly highlights was semi decent graphics. and nice soundtrack. Also controls are fully rebindable.\n\nI manged two hours of this grinding tedium, before my will to resist broke and I unistalled.

In the first 20 minutes I was tempted to turn it off and uninstall, due to the fact that the story became stale from the get go, as well as how the hit reg was implemented. Soon after you empty your clip into a dumb enemy, you'll no doubt notice that it takes more than half a clip for the enemy to go down. This is due to the first few bullets which register, which then triggers an animation in the enemies model so you know you're hitting them, but sadly the animation also negates any other bullets to register until such animation is done executing. Once you notice this, you'll find that firing in short bursts, spacing your shots so that the animation finishes through, then fire again is more effective, but also ridiculous. I also haven't come across a game in which an enemy needs 2 - 3 headshots before a death...\n\nScourge: Outbreaks story is also unoriginal and has been told many times before. Basically a mega corporation has monopolized a vital resource but by a sinister means, and thus you are tasked to fight your way to the grand dismantling of said corporation. This story has been told in the "Alien" universe to some extent, and  is way more interesting.\n\nThe AI is, for the most part, stupid. Think of the Dreamcast or Nintendo 64 days, in which the AI ran around blindly or jumping for cover in which you are behind, taking such cover, then realizing that you're the enemy and then starts to shoot you. The story tries to reconcile this by telling the player that "They are under psychic control!" which basically means that the developers decided that it was easier to implement a stupid AI than to implement a stronger one, and try to reconcile this through the story. Thankfully, most of us gamers see through ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and laziness when it comes to games like this.\n\nThough I've only played a brief bit of the game, I feel confident that this doesn't break any new ground, or even old cracked ground for that matter. The story is worn, the graphics are unspectacular, the voice acting us below sub-par, and the feeling that this game is a waste of time is enormous. If I were you, I'd save your money and buy something more worthwhile than Sourge: Outbreak.\n\nUPDATE: After 3 more hours of playing this game, I can truly say that this game sucks. Infinite spawning enemies, grenade spam by the AI, the part in which you gotta destroy a dropship becomes more and more difficult (Dropship fires increasinly more rockets) as you try to destroy conduits which take forever to destroy. Oh, and the ally AI likes to group together and take cover behind each other, as that's what we do when we real people play these sort of games.","July 26, 2014","false","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I like the controls, and the gameplay is pretty good. My only real complaint about the main campaign is the fact that enemies take too much ammo to kill, especially when you begin to encounter the scourge creatures. You might kill three or four before you run out of ammo with a particular weapon. Fortunately, there is LOTS of ammo lying around. You just have to go get it. Also, there are times when you are pinned down and it would seem that the best solution is to just hold your position. However, this is not always the correct solution as there are times when the enemy will send an infinite amout of enemies to attack you. You have to fight through them. This would not be a problem if your team members would tell this to you in order for you to get a hint. Other than that, I find it to be a solid third person shooter experience. It's too bad this game did not do better.\n\nAlso: This game has BOTS that you can use for multiplayer. I am very happy about this because there has been a major shortage of bots in games lately. This is now my official game to play when I want to play a shooter but not with others (I hate multiplayer).","July 1, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sounds great right? Sadly this game is huge disappointment (at least for single player experience). Since this is 4 people coop game then playing solo you will accompany with 3 brain dead AI. Terrible skill trees which also means auto level up and no there are no character stats only skills which game will assign for you. No manual save which means auto checkpoints at the worst places.\n\nCombat.\nIt is tactical and simple? No, there is nothing simple in it. Game just spawns bunch of mobs and that's it and forces you to sit in cover and from time to time enemy AI throws some grenades at you for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. In second chapter where you encounter new alien enemy types is just plain dumb, because it took me about 15 restarts to finally understand what i have to do in order to get further. In other words you have to get some kinda DNA but to get to that you must kill bunch of aliens. Simple? No, game just keeps spawning them, does not matter how many you killed they keep coming at you. Aliens have ranged and malee attacks, ranged is much weaker but still annoying because if i'm correct they slow you down and malee is just brutal, if they jump on player 3 hits is enough to kill you.\n\nWeapons.\nSimple. Lack of weapons. There are 7 types of them. And you can't upgrade none of them. Because why would you right? It would be too easy. Almost forgot, you can't insta kill anyone with shotguns even better assault rifles have more damage than shotguns.\n\nOverall.\nI was really looking forward to this game, but sadly i was frustrated by it.","October 18, 2014","false","4.5"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","4"

While you have limited ammo and your Special power attack doesn't do crap to them.\nPlaying 2 players co-op - got wiped 15 times on EACH checkpoint. Not fun, just stupid.\n\nWeapons dropped by enemies wanish after cca 5 secs. Need ammo? Too bad.\n\nWhen playing Coop, you can never tell player from enemy soldiers.\n\nA 'deathtrap' places where you suddenly die for no reason ? or are jumped and insta-killed by large enemy without any warning or chance to react.May seem like a little things, but when encountered every minute of a gameplay, it will frustrate to the point of uninstall.\n\nSome Pros:\n4 players, full campaign coop. Something still very rare in games.\nVery nice graphic\nInteresting story\nShooting feels like old good FPS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/227560/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Scourge Outbreak is basically a 4 player buddy 3rd person shooter in a sci-fi motif, that goes for the fast and furious instead of any precision. There's this long story about how this Merc squad that goes by call sign "Echo Squad" was working for this "Tarn Initiative" which is some sort of secret org out to break the monopoly of Noguri Corporation, and each of the 4 members have a personal reason against this monolith. And there are signs that the Noguri Corp is using some sort of xeno material they got from an asteroid for something really sinister...\n\nIn practice, this game is a mix of corridor crawl with a good dose of run-and-gun that's reminiscent of CODMW or Counterstrike levels, albeit not as many alternate paths. You can only carry two weapons at a time, and you can choose any of the 4 classes available, and choose a special "perk" that gives you a bonus. So choose your weapons carefully depending on ammo available. The best gun you have may not be the one with the most ammo.\n\nThis game gives a good variation on the guns though, as each type of gun (assault rifle, SMG, pistol, shotgun... ) can be of one of several variants, or just plain. Variants can have increased accuracy, faster reload, increased damage, better stability, even grenade launcher, depending on the weapon. This makes the game less monotonous without going into "which gun is better" bazillion variants like Borderlands series.\n\nIn practice, the guns do feel powerful enough, and sounds okay. The heavy weapons like mini-gatling sound serious, but the plasma gun seem to be quite undersized. There's a full cover system, where you can even blind-fire from cover.\n\nThe game gave each character two special skills... With enough "ambrosia" energy, each character to either generate a temporary forcefield for protection, or cause an energy smash to zap all enemies nearby. There are two versions of the shield (static vs. dynamic) and two versions of the energy smash (again, static or dynamic) for 4 variations (one for each class of characters).  On easy you may rarely use the shield, or smash, but on higher levels it may be the only way to survive when you get swarmed by enemies.\n\nThe graphics are quite good but not extraordinary. The character models have the right poly count to look detailed enough. However, the voices are not very distintive, esp. for the 'soldier' guy. Weapons sound and music are okay.\n\nThe writing seems to be above average, as the game really does start on a bang. When sent to infiltrate the enemy facility, your drop pod was hit (by what?) before you even hit the ground and you lost most of your weapons. Can you survive until you find something? You are helped by a guy on the radio, as you try to chase down the traitors that got you shot down, but is that what's really going on, or are you being played for some alternate purpose? As you fight through the levels, you discover clues that perhaps, things are not quite what they seem, but you're already committed...\n\nThe AI is actually quite decent. If you "fall" your 3 AI buddies will do their best (even raise their shields) to gain some time to revive you (and you're supposed to revive them too if they fall). Obviously if you fall in the middle of an enemy horde, you may bleed out before they get to you. And if all of them got incapacitated it's game over, man.  Besides that, AI buddies will take cover, shoot, protect certain spots, etc. They will even take orders from you to go somewhere, get on certain trurrets, and so on.\n\nThe bosses are pretty good. So far I've killed 5 bosses and they all involve different methods. Enemy gunship requires sticky grenades... or environmental trap. Level end boss are sufficiently tough to be challenging but not impossible, if you figure out the problem. Else, you'll waste ammo and curse.\n\nOne weird part about this game is there is no save function, only checkpoints that save automatically, and it seems it's MOSTLY at the right places.\n\nAll in all, Scourge is basically an attempt to redefine the SciFi 3rd person shooter, and this one is actually quite good despite its lack of big-name publisher. If you like this genre, give it a try.","December 27, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So I thought it odd that I hadn't played the original Scourge: Outbreak episodes even though I had bought them a while ago. But thanks to the generosity of developer Tragnarion Studios I was able to play the remastered version. My thoughts? Not too bad. You play part of a group of mercenaries looking to take down the Nogari Corporation and retrieve a piece of meteorite used to create a powerful synthetic. Scourge really doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's chock full of 3rd person run and gun action and really that's about it. You go from point A to point B killing lots of aliens and other things in your way. The graphics aren't bad, the controls are responsive and it sounds good. It does have a few bugaboos though. The AI is not good. Not the enemy and certainly not your squad. I bet multiplayer would be an absolute blast. The checkpoint save system SUCKS. If you die mid mission, prepare to repeat stuff and you WILL die during this game as there were times where I found it very difficult. Parts in Chapter 2 had me wanting to bang my head. The level design is also pretty uninspired. other than a cool section inside a mountain and some areas towards the end, you'll be indoors traversing labs etc. Pretty bland. But that said, if you're looking a  pretty fun way to blow 6-8 hours you could do worse than Scourge. It doesn't come close to a top shelf cover shooter like Spec Ops but even at MSRP it's worth a shot. 7/10 from me.","August 2, 2014","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is an extremely linear, uncomplicated cover shooter with decent graphics and a trite story that functions mainly as a link between the frequent and generally satisfying battles. Nothing groundbreaking, but nothing bottom of the barrel either.\n\nIf you've played XCOM: The Bureau (a superior game based on the same mould) you should know what to expect. Everything in S:O screams average: you've seen the characters a thousands times before, their powers are all variations of the same combo (shield/shockwave) and the weapon selection is just enough to afford some variation when dealing with the few types of enemies you'll encounter along the way. Once you get past the quirkiness and somewhat cheap feel of it all, you may find yourself enjoying the B movie appeal this game has to offer. I know it kept me entertained until the end.\n\nThese are the general pros, including the fact that the bosses are actually fun to fight and not excessively demanding. I generally hate bosses, so this is a definite plus for me.\n\nNow, for a few specific cons:\n- The command system sucks. I simply couldn't get people to move to the spot I was asking them to half of the time. Eventually I all but dropped it.\n- The cover aspect is wonky too, with too many instances of my character rolling in place when he should have been taken cover behind a crate/wall.\n- Enemies are indeed "bullet sponges". Be prepared to unload several clips on some of the standard critters before seeing them fall, let alone the tougher ones.\n- Checkpoint placing is really bad in a few spots. I presume this was done intentionally to lengthen the game.\n\nNow, for the mother of all cons: After meeting the scourge for the first time during the infamous mission where the bugs are introduced, I was literally about to UNINSTALL THE GAME. Just one click away. Something possessed me to go back and try just one last time, and what do you know I made it through. But it took me countless attempts and unordinate amounts of frustration -- all this on Normal difficulty.\n\nThat mission features a crazy difficulty spike that is bound to surprise and turn many people off. At first I thought I was missing something, as my shotgun was having the efficacy of a pea-shooter (and yet it seems to be the weapon you should be using, judging by the available ammunition crates) and my comrades were either dying left and right or letting me die while they were busy scraping the bugs off them. Worst of all: after trying countless times and finally managing to make it to the other end of the terrace, killing all the mini-boss bugs and activating the switch, I found I had to trace my steps back and fight yet more battles -- all this without the respite of a checkpoint.\n\nI know the devs meant to convey the danger posed by the scourge with this first encounter, but they should be aware that they crossed the line well into not-fun territory. A checkpoint placed midway would help reduce frustration while still allowing the scene to convey the intended feeling.\n\nAll said, the game is enjoyable, very easy to pick up in short intervals, battles are frequent and furious, and on top of it all it can be obtained generally cheap. I haven`t tried multiplayer but I imagine it could be a blast. I'd recommend it for those eager to get a quick action fix.\n\n\n","April 15, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a blast to play Doom like this, but in full 3D, you just feel visually impaired. Anyhow, Scourge : Outbreak solved this problem, so I finally was able to play it.\n\nAside Left 4 Dead, it was the second time I played a "third person / team based / tactical fps" but since I love real-time party-RPGs like Dungeon Siege, or turn-by-turn tactical RPGs like FallOut Tactics, this one sounded engaging.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty straightforward : choose one of the 4 characters, use a tutorial if you need and get some backstory (nice addition), then run into action with your fellow heavily armored buddies, receiving mission updates along the way.\n\nIt seems that the game makes a good use of modern FPS tropes like choose-2-weapons-to-carry and glue-yourself-behind-boxes. The orders you can give are contextualized : depending on where, who or what you are targeting, you can have the closer team member take cover, focus on an enemy, open a door, use a turret, revive another team member ; without losing the pace of the fight which is great. Overall, each team member is a decent shooter and never forgives to save you even under heavy fire.\n\nThe special abilities are kinda neat, but for me, the real pleasure of the game was to consider each confrontation as a puzzle : where should I position each team member in order to assault or defend? Sometimes an sub-optimal line of sight could cost your team frequent death/revive cycles.\n\nThe enemies are challenging enough, even in beginner more. Soldiers can take advantage of the level and bosses requires some strategic planning. But the strange design decision of infinite critters that mysteriously vanish when you reach the next checkpoint somewhat disrupted the experience.\n\nSince the storyline is purely functional and the characters kinda stereotypical, playing solely for the story won't reward you. It seems that there is a leveling mechanic, granting you points in different categories like "short range kill", "head shot", "assistance" but I don't know if it grants you with bonuses except for the powers.\n\nTo wrap it up, Scourge Outbreak is a decent team-based shooter, with a nice game flow, and correct level design. Nothing truly memorable though, so it feels more like a filler.","February 7, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can honestly say that if you're planning to play this game for great effects and a large majority of powers and weapons, you bought the wrong game. This game is lacking, in near on all aspects. The weapons are limited to a few types: smg, assault rifle (burst only), pistol, Sniper rifle, grenade launcher, and maybe 1 or 2 more i forgot to mention. The powers are the same, relatively speaking, for each character. And the movement animation is the same as well, which isn't that big of a problem until you see the female character walk. (I laughed). The redeeming quality of this game is the action. The action is good, very good. There are points in the game where you don't think you'll make it out of a fight unless you time your powers just right. The action is partly why i have near on 50 hrs. in the DEMO alone and why i bought the full game later on. The story is good too, they could have added a bit of background to each character but the point of view you have differes with each character you play (there are flashbacks). All in all, this is not what i would call an 'awesome' game, but it is good enough to buy for the price it's listed at, not to mention it runs on sale quite a few times. If you like action then i recommend this game to you, just don't come looking for much variety of other things. 7/10\n","December 24, 2014","true","39.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not that the single player campaign is in anyway limited or lacking when played alone. It's just more fun to play it with other people. There is also a pvp mode in addition to single player/co-op campaign. The reason I am writing this review is because I went to the store page after being notified there had been new content/DLC released. The DLC is definitely optional and it's included with the Ambrosia Bundle which is pretty giving you the DLC for over half off. It seems to act as somewhat of a seasons pass since the pvp maps weren't available when I purchased this but they're apart of my library. I don't know if everyone needs to have the map pack to play it I assume that's the case. To which I would say only get the DLC if your friends are and its cheaper to get the Ambroasia Bundle than it is to buy the map pack seperately. The Ambrosia pack also includes a Digital Concept Art book which includes various artwork from the game, you also get a digital Soundtrack which is the "immersive music" that was composed for the game I assume.","November 24, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just a nice Third-person-shooter. You have to make it through several maps with objectives against an enemy army and monsters they have created (monsters come in later). Your team kinda sucks (playing singleplayer) but it can be done fine solo. Even or Nightmare difficulty. Playing with other makes it more fun but it doesn't have that many players. But overall it's not that expensive and it will give you lots of hours of playtime (campaign has a decent lengt). Recommended.","February 27","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","A very average 4-player co-op cover-based third-person shooter. The story, the gameplay mechanics, average.\n\nThe control scheme was designed for a controller but works and plays better with keyboard & mouse. The only small trouble with this kind of thing here is that for just one button/key you can roll, snap into cover, and sprint.\n\nThis is a game that's meant to be played with others and it's likely to be more fun when doing so since the base game is rather mediocore (at least when playing alone) and your AI companions can be more of a detrement than useful in a gunfight. For example you can point at a specific enemy and tell one or more of your members to attack it but likely they either won't or they'll charge in for what you pointed at themselves even in heavy crossfire. The AI usually does fine though when you point and tell them to press a button or just walk to a targeted area. If someone in the team is down the AI's first automatic priority is to revive, but the bad news with that is that it practically becomes their ONLY priority if someone's down, meaning they'll barely make any other useful decisions like fending off very nearby baddies first who are directly attacking both the downed teammate and the person reviving.\n\nThroughout this you'll be thrown hoardes of bullet-soaking enemies that can take 3 or more headshots to kill from most guns, and sometimes a never-ending wave of them until you reach an objective. Hard to tell when it's going to be a never-ending wave since likely you'll be wanting to keep shooting until they stop and that's IF the spawning stops otherwise you'd just have to find a good chance to make a break for the marked objective.\n\nThe multiplayer lobby is practically dead and the best bet for a co-op run is to ask around outside of the game but if you can find someone to play with it's probably actually fun. I only got halfway through the game since playing it alone became a real bore.","March 28","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustdust/recommended/227560/","dustdust","dustdust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dustdust/","3038 products in account","This is the homeless man's version of Gears of War (if he also had a gimpy leg). The main issue is that co-op is forced upon you from the start, thus making you rely on your 3 incompetent AI idiot partners (don't bother trying multiplayer since it's completely dead). Even if you don't die, they will and you will be forced to start from the last checkpoint (in which there are  far too few in a game that heavily relies on bad AI). Issuing commands is useless because rarely ever will they attack the enemy they are supposed to. All of the guns seem underpowered (at least in Gears, a few headshots to the Locust grunts will put them down quickly; in this game, it doesn't matter if you shoot them in the head or legs, there is no difference in damage). The cover system is passable, but your character oftentimes will slide to another wall or obstacle that you don't want them to. Don't bother wasting your time or money - play Gears of War instead (or wait for it to be released on Steam, however long that may take).","February 6","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game isn't so bad, it was my first game in Steam in 2010. It's kinda trash, but I buyed a 4-pack with my friends, then we just played it for a couple hours. It was fun! I can't say nowadays that I'd spend even a 3$ for this, but its free for whos already have the original game. Maybe, you'd try to find very low price on the sale. One of the thing I'm glad to see is the languages. There is even russian. Another one thing is 4-player coop. I know, the developers just wanted to see their game awesome, but, you know, the graphics is like in 2010, (hi-res textures, wut?), gameplay is boring (shoot-cover-shoot), an awful scenario (and classes? lolwut, ♥♥♥♥♥ please) THE GAME KINDA "GEARS OF WAR FOR 2 DOLLA" So, now, in 2014, the nostalgy comes back.\n\n5\10","April 5, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a basic cover mechanic, decent weapons (spent most of the games trying to get each weapon's specific achievement, which was fun), and no major bugs.  The main downsides are that even on easy there are some frustratingly difficult patches with waves of really hard to kill enemies swarming you, and no bosses for the first 2/3 of the game.  It's not amazing, but held our attention for the 5-7 hour compaign.","August 15, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As one of the few games that ACTUALLY SUPPORTS CO-OP CAMPAIGN, it has that going for it. My bro and I are constantly looking for co-op games that we can actually play together. There's a lot of other much better co-op games, but if you've already exhausted that list, and you see this one on sale, go for it. You're still going to be doing a lot of cursing over TeamSpeak, but at least you're playing together...\n\nLonger: Game leaves you searching for ammo- it's like the devs couldn't decide which types of ammo to provide, so at certain points in the game you keep having to switch for different guns because they keep providing different kinds of ammo. WTF? Plot is... I'm sorry writers, but stupid, confusing, and pointless, and the "plot twist" is completely predictable.\n\nGame mechanics are so frustrating: grenades are impossible to throw; when you run, it's like "snap to grid" but for running; the bosses are hard to figure out, and annoying as hell, as in boss keeps recharing, and you keep having to kill minions to "whittle" each boss down.\n\nAll in all- I don't recommend, I even got it on sale, still don't recommend.","December 20, 2015","false","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
