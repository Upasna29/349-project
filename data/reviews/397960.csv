He never returned from his second expedition. But you, you decide to find what happened. And guess what? You're stranded too... and with a traitor in the crew...\n\nThe plot is simple though I found the story short. The hours I've spent reflect the guide I've made about objects. But still, if the plot was beginning well, you have some holes: what happened to the captain? How come the mechanic was taken by the evil spirit if he was a prisonner?\n\nThe puzzles, if for some, are easy, for others, are quite a challenge. I had to skip some because it was a pain in the ♥♥♥ to try to catch the fish or you need to know the moon phases or you don't have real indication about how to solve that. The HO scenes were normal, though some items are difficult to spot, as they can be confused as part of another (got the case with a German grenade, where the handle was the same as a tool).\n\nThe official achievements can be done quickly. Nothing is rewarding you in the end for defeating evil, fishing for the Inuit, etc... But than you have hidden ones: 1 per relic or beyond object (object disappearing and reappearin)... Not every scene has them and sometimes, a beyond object and a relic can be in the same one.\n\nThe graphics are alright, but the characters are filmed actors. I would say that it's maybe weird to see them like that in a drawn scene. While it's maybe a nice intention, I didn't find that so... well-executed. The actors are correct, it's not that but how it was integrated....  during these scenes, I had pixels around....\n\nThe little nice add is to find coins to buy the pingoo a pool, a tv, a basket-ball. It's making me smile and while it's not very developed, it's still a little feature that is appreciated.\n\nThe soundtrack is alright too.\n\nSo, while I'm feeling perhaps mixed for this game, I'll still recommend to grab it with a nice discount. It's enjoyable, with "easy" achievements for those who loves 100%.","November 14, 2015","true","4.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed the progress of the story and the interactive character’s who play their part in your progress.  I liked the option of being able to alter the hidden object scenes into jigsaw puzzles to solve instead.  I did find it frustrating at one point when I had to pause play and return at a later date and was unsure of the next task. I insisted on using the hint option which kept instructing me to a situation that I did not possess the tools to solve at that point.  Thankfully I attended all previous scenes and found the tool and task to be completed.  I was also a little disappointed in needing to specifically orientate a tool within a scene before it was recognized as the appropriate activity.  I had presented the tool multiple times within the scene and had it be rejected.  I was blown away by the injected realism of the crew interactive scenes.  By making those scenes realistic it made the game and the story line more believable and there the gamer became more invested in the outcome.  I also loved the way history and culture was injected into the story.  The history, beliefs and traditions of the Inuit people give the story line and game a link between the tangible history of an ancient culture and the mystery surrounding it.\n\nI recommend Mystery Expedition: Prisoners of Ice to fans of hidden object fans. The story is the high point here.\n\n- Ainslie's Little Pearls\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 23","true","3.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"
