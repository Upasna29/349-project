While I enjoyed ar-k 1 and 2 and I do recommend those games to play first, this for me is a lot better - story, graphics, setting.  The writing was very good and if you didn't want to read everything, you didn't need to click on that character's bit of conversation but could come back to it if you wanted.  I liked the humour, and it was witty in parts.  It is the perfect balance of not just a good story which is vital in an adventure game but also good interactive gameplay.\n\nYou continue to play as Alicia and thankfully she is more likable.  In the first episode the OTT "I am a sexy vixen" coupled with a not nice attitude a lot of the times frankly put me off her and I didn't care what happened to her, but by the end of E1 this was mostly gone and here I actually cared and liked her.\n\nThe story continues from 1 & 2 and I loved how at the end of episodes there is just enough surprise or hook to keep you invested for the next epsiode, it is literally a cliffhanger ending (not resolved or tied up with bow) with all of them and this episode is the same.\n\nI love the setting in this game (all new) and I got to solve a murder as well which was cool.  There is also a transporter map so you aren't wasting time walking everywhere.\n\nWhile you could play this on it's own I do think there would be too many unanswered questions (what is the sphere, why am I here etc) and I do think you need to play the first game (which has episodes 1& 2 in it) to know what is going on.  There is a video intro at the beginning which is supposed to recap what has happened but I don't know why but the clips seemed out of sequence, and they could have done a lot better job of a recap, seemed very disjointed.\n\nI loved the achievements in the first game, very imaginative and different but here it was mostly straightforward and some more unusual ones would have been fun.  There is one though which I didn't see the point of and will be a bit annoying to do (worker one,)  - so don't go by my final time re gameplay!\n\nThoroughly enjoyed it and I really look forward to the fourth and final episode.   Thanks DEVS for a very good, fun point n click adventure game.","July 17, 2015","true","18.4"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","6"

DO NOT buy the first two episodes which are bundled together in AR-K. Unless you are a completionist that must have a complete series, really don't play the first two. This game begins with a "Previously on AR-K" and shows you all the cut scenes and dialogs from the last two episodes that you need to know. 6 hours you could waste on the first two episodes are summed up in a couple of minutes.\nNow the good stuff: EVERYTHING I felt that made the first two episodes bad has been fixed. My compliments to the developers who know when to correct mistakes. The characters are much much more likable, the puzzles, while sometimes needing some thought, are not nonsensical. I didn't find this episode boring at all, and all the side missions served a definite purpose. The game looks great! I love how the colors pop. The voice acting is also great.\nBelieve it or not, I really can't think of any jarring negatives. This episode was a giant leap forward. If anything, this is the quality that should have been present in the first two episodes. It set up Episode 4 perfectly, and I can't wait to play it!\n","November 5, 2015","true","5.1"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","41","51","0","6"

If I did was becuse of the 73% discount, and I must say it was a great deal.\n\nAnyone can see the graphics are much better just comparing the screenshots, the gameplay was also improved (they took off that annoying inventory and made a better one), animations, STORY... Everything is much better than the first episodes. They really learned something about how to make a point-and-click game.\n\nI'm really enjoying the story, in my opinion it's the most important part in a game like this. First chapters were too simple and a little boring, and the solution for a couple of puzzles was a real nonsense. This game is absolutely different, has a few characters that are GOLD (don't miss Phil the scientist, the little girl or Horn), balanced puzzles (some simpler and a few more complex) and a lot of hints about ARK that the first chapters lacked.\n\nThe game looks quite simple in the first scenes, but after the factory it brings a lot of different scenarios and interesting puzzles (I specially liked the murder). I would recomend the game even if you don't buy the first two chapters, this one alone is a great game (in fact, I would reccomend not to buy the first chapters).\n\nOf course, it's not perfect, has a few flaws:\nThe "previously" video, that plays when you start the game is simply terrible. Long, boring and annoying. I think it's the heritance of the first part. The good news are that things can only go better from here.\n\nThe first screen has too many videos, the hospital has too much talking. After that the game finds the perfect balance, but I feel like these two scenes could be a little better.\n\nCardesians voices are soooo annoying!\nAnyway, these are just a few cons that can't make this game bad. I think this is one of the best adventures I played in the last few years.\n\nGood work, keep it for the 4th chapter!!","July 16, 2015","true","5.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

It's a bit disappointing that the dev felt the need to switch to individual installments purchased separately rather than the episodic format of the first two games, but this game is an improvement in almost every aspect over the other two. To be honest, you could probably skip the first two episodes without much trouble and drop right in at The Great Escape and still have a great experience.\n\nThe story overall was interesting and had much more of a sense of direction to it. The story that the game is telling is nothing new in the sci-fi genre, but it's told well. Most of the characters are interesting and fun, and Alicia (the protagonist) is fleshing out to become a more likable character.\n\nVoice acting is mostly great, all actors deliver their lines with believable emotion. However, the actors could have used a bit more direction in terms of pronouncing names and made-up terms correctly (the name of Franky's species comes to mind) so that the world feels a little more real. Additionally, the humour sometimes gets a little too self-referential (the conversation with the little girl about "female characters", the guy who tells you to "wait for Chapter Four") and there was one kind of unnecessary joke where the punch line is a male character disguising himself as a woman that might bother some people.\n\nI enjoyed most of the puzzles a lot, particularly a great logic puzzle near the end (however the text in this puzzle could use a little native speaker proofreading). Most of the time I felt like I knew what I was doing and why, which is really all I ask.","July 26, 2015","true","3.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

In the first two installments, they established the setting and characters, though the game mechanics were not polished. The puzzles were troublesome more on account of a clumsy user interface, though this was in addition to the puzzles being somewhat obscure (i.e., just keep rubbing items together until something works).\n\nPart 3 is a more satisfying, polished experience, in terms of plot structure, character motivations, puzzle logic, artwork, and user interface. If you want to skip parts 1 and 2, then all you need to understand for part 3 is the following:\n\n\n-- SPOILERS --\n\nThe lead character (Alicia) was framed for having stolen a golden sphere, about the size of a softball. The sphere is a piece of high technology that can hold an electric charge. The origins of the sphere are unknown, though more is revealed in part 3.\n\nAlicia has a love interest (Blaine) that works for a corporation that has an interest in the golden sphere.\n\nBlaine has an ex-love interest whom also works for the corporation.\n\nAlicia has a friend, Franky, who is essentially an alien minotaur.

On its own, probably not as it provides only 3-4 hours worth of narrative. However if you are willing to grind your teeth trough some poorly designed puzzles in episones 1&2, the total of 10E for all three is worth the investment.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bio-326/recommended/368890/","bio-326","Bioraye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bio-326/","25 products in account","This game is rather special... in a confusing & erratic, but catchy way nonetheless.\n\nStory:\n\nThe AR-K is a futuristic, super-clean & high-tech environment (like a city) that runs on a mysterious power source (in this chapter of the game it is revealed what kind of power source & how this is achieved...).\n\nThe main character (Alicia) is back... with a broken leg - ouch! She somehow got herself stuck in some dump (which really happens to be an underground hidden sector of the AR-K universe - gasp!).\n\nHer trustworthy & dependable friend "Franky" also happens to be in the neighbourhood, and helps her along the way (through use of a PDA).\n\n\nCharacters:\n\nAlicia (the protagonist - a framed ex-cop & student of journalism - who finds herself stuck some place underground in this chapter)\n\nFranky (a walking & talking "swagger" bull - originally belonging to what is referred to as the "Valerian race" - used to run a burger joint, until he ended up underground along with Alicia)\n\nGrigor (lives underground, and ends up helping Alicia & Franky escape)\n\n\nUI/mechanics:\n\nPretty simple, point & click style navigation. Simplified inventory (click, drag, combine items), but runs awfully slow when actually clicked... and dragged. Feels like a total drag (unintentional pun right there...).\n\nThe game progression consists mostly of some intuitive play & trial & error, with some help from Franky (by clicking his portret first, and then point-clicking any interactable surface).\n\nThis game is most suited for players of a curious nature who like embarking on a journey without having to follow strict guidelines (the objectives are pretty blurry - there's no journal to keep track of progress or anything of the like).\n\nI often times had a vague idea of what needed to be done (due to hints dropped by the subcharacters), but wasn't quite sure how to reach a specific goal.\n\nSo players who prefer methodical, linear gameplay could potentially feel stressed by this, as you're dumped somewhere and expected to find out things on your own (with a weee bit of help from the sidekick, but that's about it!).\n\nThough there is a map button that helps you get where you need to be without having to run around (though, IMO - it's preferable if you do walk, because you might tend to overlook certain details otherwise).\n\n\nCharacter design & game graphics:\n\nAlicia's physical design is... annoying. Her body is okay, but the way they styled her is flat out irritating, because 99% of the time she appears to have her generously shaped bosom up in the air, right in your face, whenever she walks. And whatever she wears apparently HAS to be ultra thin, super clingy 100% spandex, juuust so every line & curve of her body is visible and up in your face!\n\nBecause there's no other type of fabric in the world, right? And Alicia is obviously very fond of super skinny size, which really has her looking cheap.\n\nIt's anything but flattering and simply annoying - BUT, definitely an improvement from what she looked like in chapter 1.\n\nRegardless of this, I do like her witty & acrid sense of humour (it is refreshing!).\n\nShe's quite headstrong & feisty and loves to explore. If she's told she can't do something, she'll go ahead and do it anyway.\n\nShe may appear obnoxious at first (especially in the first chapter), but overall, she's mostly an independent-natured girl who likes her freedom and is not afraid to enjoy herself. She's not exactly conservative ;).\n\nIt is heavily suggested that Alicia is very bright & smart, but her potential isn't really displayed in-game.\n\nThere were often 3D cinematic cutscenes after completion of puzzles, which unfortunately got the game to freeze up almost every single time (without crashing though). The cutscenes were mostly unnecessary, yet enticing at times. In the end I think it didn't really add that much value.\n\nThe game could have done without!\n\nDialogue:\n\nOh gee. Where do I start? Well, it's rather awkward & repetitive - almost always with a witty twist though. You just get a typical list of things to ask, and ask away till you're out of questions.\n\nThere are some spelling & grammatical mistakes though (it does help to know the developers are hispanic, and assuming their mother-tongue is different from English, this could explain the oddities - to a certain degree - in this regard).\n\nUnfortunately, dialogues sometimes felt erratic due to faulty scripting (I always play with subtitles, and at times the subtitles didn't match what was being said by the characters, or what was said didn't make sense at all).\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI dropped 1, skipped 2, but finished 3, because the game mechanics were simplified in this chapter (though still aggravating due to sluggishness, but playable nonetheless).\n\nThanks to the inclusion of a visual synopsis, I was able to catch up on what had formerly taken place in chapter 1 & 2 without having to play them.\n\nIf you're planning on playing the first 2 chapters, you'll want to keep a guide at hand though, just to avoid any unnecessary frustrations in regard to game progression and gameplay.\n\nFinally, I think AR-K does have a special endearing feel to it (story-wise), so in the end I liked it :).","April 2","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
