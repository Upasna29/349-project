"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/288060/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3060 products in account","Games like this are hard to judge on face value alone. When you take more common, action oriented titles, it can be easier to tell from just a minute or two of uninterrupted gameplay footage if a game is going to be worth your time or not. But slower paced, narrative focused titles, like Whispering Willows, are considerably harder to figure out from just viewing a short trailer. Games like this are driven by their quality of narrative and puzzle design. Does the crisp and whimsical imagery evident in WW’s screenshots affirm a similarly elegant literary and brain teasing experience? Unfortunately, no, not even close. But Whispering Willows is still an endearing first effort by fledgling studio Night Light Interactive, even with the game’s numerous flaws. In fact, it’s more what the game doesn’t try to do that is most disheartening.\n\nI’ll begin with the most egregious error this game makes: the quality of narrative. The story is thus: young Elena’s father has gone missing, and has been for some time. After waking from a particularly vivid nightmare of her father being held captive by something, she races to an old, decrepit mansion, of which her father is the groundskeeper. She soon meets the ghost of her ancestor, who teaches her of her heritage, and of her innate ability to leave her body and walk the earth as a spirit, allowing her to commune with the ghosts of those who have yet to pass. What follows is a supernatural tale of loss, deceit and the darkness that festers within.\n\nIn truth, the narrative plays out like cross between a darker Goosebumps tale with bits of Clive Barker’s grotesque imagery. This is partly due to the art style; it just doesn’t convey feelings of foreboding and fearfulness that I believe the narrative wants to. Worse, the story takes virtually no risks. But what really hurts the experience is the quality of the dialogue. Throughout the adventure, you will speak with the deceased, and often be asked to find items of importance to them to progress through the story. The dialogue that occurs here is just, well… the best thing I can call it would be, “serviceable”. The dialogue is so often uninspired and plain that it would keep me from really caring for any of the characters’ plights.\n\nI feel I’ve spoken enough on the negatives of the narrative, so let’s move on to the disappointment of the game’s main mechanic, your spirit form, and the weak puzzle design dependent on it. The lack of pluralization is not a mistake, Whispering Willows’ mechanic of Elena’s spirit form most often offers only a single type of puzzle throughout the game. You will come across locked doors, and you will either need to pick up a poorly hidden key or flip a switch. Usually, this means that there is a finely carved, perfectly square hole in the wall or ceiling near to you for your spirit form to slink through. Do so, and there will be a bright blue glowing thing for you to interact with. This interaction opens the door. This is how nearly every “puzzle” in WW plays out. I can only think of a handful of individual puzzles that do not play out in the same way, though they themselves were no more complex than filling a hole or playing Simon Says with a moveable object. The simple puzzle design falls in line with the game’s progression; it’s largely linear, with nary a handful of instances where you will have to seek out an item outside of the area you’re already in. Even then, though, the item’s location is always spelled out for you, so this is really no more than a mode of adding longevity to this short adventure. And it is short. In total, I completed the game in under three hours.\n\nWhew, that was a lot of negativity. How about we move on to the more positive aspects of Willows? Speaking purely of the in-game graphics and art style, my opinion is decidedly varied. On one hand, the environments that you explore never amount to anything special, and much like the dialogue, they are content with remaining largely serviceable. The same can be said for the few human characters in-game, who, along with some stilted animations, look oddly plain. This is in stark contrast to my favorite portion of the game, the ghost designs. Their visages reflect how they died, and their appearances range from the grotesque to cringe inducing. Their designs are absolutely phenomenal, and it’s evident where the best of the artistic talent went in the creation of this game. The same can be said for Elena’s own spirit form, whose flowing hair and glowing visage look fantastic, especially in the light of the full moon in outdoor areas.\n\nWhile the dialogue between yourself and haunting spirits itself does the overall narrative little favor, your interactions with the ghosts of the mansion’s grounds are enriched by the previously mentioned collectible notes scattered along your path throughout the game. Each is one of several diary entries left by the formerly living, and each tells a tale of their final days. While few of them are terribly unique in their subject matter, finding that final piece of each story provided me a greater driving force for playing than the main narrative itself.\n\nAs negative as this review has been, the greatest fault I can levy against this game is not what it does poorly, but rather in what it does not even attempt to do. Given all that has already been done with a similar ability in other games, why is Elena’s spirit walking ability as limited as it is? The game is content with delivering only the most lackluster and plain variation possible. And the dialogue... in an adventure title such as this, gameplay often takes a backseat to the narrative. Only, in this case, both aspects are severely limited in their designs. If the sole gameplay mechanic is to be as limited as it is, why was the dialogue not given greater love, to compensate? The game is so filled with potential, and occasionally, this potential appears as though it’s so near to bubbling to the surface, only to be pushed back down below by weak interactions and the umpteenth recycled door “puzzle”.\n\nI did not hate my time with Whispering Willows. Though admittedly, my want to love it so completely has perhaps made me more critical of its faults. I’ll leave it at this: Whispering Willows, for all of its promise, is content with providing only an unenthusiastic effort on its part. For every glimmer of something fresh and unique, of which there are a few, Willows buries it under less-than-uninspired dialogue and consistently recycled puzzle design. I beat the game, with all of my fumbling, in under three hours. By the end, my only thoughts were on what could have been, had this game taken just a little more risk, rather than on my final moments with Elena. There just isn’t enough content or thought put into Whispering Willows to make it fully recommendable.\n\n6.5/10","July 9, 2014","true","4.3"," 94 of 112 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","94","112","0","24"

It's a salient question in this post-Greenlight age, with many games offering impressive gimmicks and visuals propped up by only an hour or two of gameplay. Whispering Willows is just such a game, a no-frills adventure game with some charming graphics and a neat mechanic that's over before you know it.\n\nYou play Elena, the Native American daughter of a groundskeeper at a super spooky mansion. He disappears, you gear up to find him, and the next thing you know you're in the ♥♥♥-end of some pretty dire catacombs. Like I said, it's an extremely straight-forward side-scrolling adventure game with notes to find, keys to collect, and notes to read. The one gimmick is astral projection, which releases your fabulously-coiffed soul to roam, slipping through tiny cracks, moving mundane objects, and talking to dead people. This mechanic develops one or two additional uses over the course of the game, and is pretty fun to dink around with, since there are no living NPCs.\n\nGame flow is clear and steady, for the most part. There's no map but the mansion and its environs are usually simple enough to follow to your next objective. The hand-drawn graphics are delightful and well-animated, though I must admit the horrific condition of the spirits you encounter clashes a bit with the lighter, kids anime art style. The story rides a fine line between dark and silly and I was engaged the whole time, it's just that the whole time was about 90 minutes. It's a short, short game and if you like the simple gameplay, you'll surely be left wanting more. I'm glad I didn't Kickstart it, but if you pick it up on sale it's a charming little adventure and I can't knock it for anything but its length.","October 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","5"

All we know is that he disappeared while working at the Willows Mansion. Along the way, you discover that you are capable of leaving your earthly body, through your amulet, to another realm, where you can communicate with spirits and possess objects.\n\nThe gameplay knows how to take advantage of it: to progress you have to change between "realms", talk to all kind of ghosts and interact with objects.  However, there are not many puzzles to solve and they all are quite easy (there's an image with the solution always nearby).\n\nAll the characters (ghosts included) are beautifully drawn. The artwork is really amazing, but is in the characters where it shines the most.\n\nThe soundtrack is very fitting for this game's atmosphere.\n\nAlthough, almost every aspect of this game is great, it's the story that comes on top. Sure, the atmosphere is eerie but you can only fully experience it if you talk with every character and, most important of all, if you read all the notes you find throughout the game. They help provide a more immersive experience. So, if you play the game, take time to read all the notes, they'll help you understand not only what happened but what is happening too.\nThe game also has its faults:\n- loading/saving screen takes more time than it should;\n- the pose Elena takes after leaving her body does not make sense (she should fall on the floor). Although, having to get up every time you came back to the corporeal body, would take more time and would be more annoying too.\n\nThe game isn't very long. You can complete it in few hours even if you read all the notes.","May 4","true","4.4"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/288060/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Whispering Willows is a side-scrolling adventure game where you play a girl named Elena who's gone to an old abandoned mansion to find her missing dad. She quickly discovers this place has a thin veil between our world and the spirit world, and with a special necklace, can part her soul from her body and rejoin them again. With her newfound supernatural powers, she goes to find her dad and learn the history of the estate.\n\nGameplay is pretty simple, you walk around, observe and occasionally interact with objects, find items, and open doors. Your amulet begins to glow when near spiritual energy, in which case you press a button and you let your soul be free. Your soul can't interact with most real world objects, but can see ghost and talk with them, and turn into a tiny flame to fit into cracks. You can also possess blue glowing objects to interact with them. There's a few puzzles, and occasionally some threat appears, in which case all you can do is avoid them and run.\n\nIt's got some interesting concepts, but honestly I felt a lot of its ideas were severely underplayed. Your ghost powers are cool, but they feel really underutilized and lack any real form of challenge, except in like one occasion. There's enemies, but they're so few and far between, and most of them are easily avoided and are hardly threatening, except on a single occasion. And the game does this with almost all of its elements. It has like one moment that's kind of unique and interesting and somewhat challenging, but then that's it, it doesn't continue to build on its interesting concepts, it sort of sits on what it's comfortable with. It really left me with a feeling that I wished the game would of been more daring.\n\nThere's very few puzzles, and the only sort of challenging ones are at the very end. There's horror 'moments', but there's only really one scene that's even kind of creepy. I don't know, maybe I'm being too hard on it, but I was left with wanting the game to be more than it was at the end.\n\nWhat the game is as opposed to what I want it to be is a very pretty fetch-quest game where you go back and forth between locations collecting items.\n\nAnd it does look very pretty. Some nice lighting effects, matched with textured objects, unique rooms, interesting sights... It's really a visual treat. The style the game has is definitely its best element, and the number of varied locations were nice to look at.\n\nThe sound is good too. Music is appropriate with a few very pretty tracks, the game is not fully voiced but the character groans and sounds worked well with the game, and they had some good ambient sounds in the environment.\n\nThe game also did an interesting job at delving into Native American folklore, which was interesting to see unfold through the course of the game.\n\nBut honestly, outside of this, I don't have much to say on the game. It was not really remarkable to me, there were periods I felt the game was just a bit dull. The threats are hardly threatening, made even less threatening on the off-chance you die that you'll start-up almost immediately where you were as this game throws checkpoints up the wazoo. The puzzles were always the kind where the solution was right next to where the puzzle actually was, the ghost are nothing more but flavor text NPC's. And the story just felt very tried and not at all remarkable, with obvious developments and an almost cheesy climax and resolution. I mean it's not inherently a bad thing and there's nothing wrong with the game, but it just is way too safe. Outside of its very interesting aesthetic look and pretty decent sound design, there's nothing remarkable about the game, it really feels like a good engine and concept wasted on a rather cookie-cutter game.\n\nI'm disappointed with it, but it's not a bad game. It has some interesting ideas, and has a good feel to it as you go through worn-down environments, and I'd say worth a play if you really like its style and don't mind a rather routine and simplified adventure game around its style. But that's what it is at the end of the day, and it's a game I don't think I want to go back too, or will remember a month from now.","July 13, 2014","true","4.1"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","38","46","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/288060/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","It’s an odd feeling to be drawn into an experience designed to haunt you in as beautiful and elegant a way as Whispered Willows. The exquisite hand drawn art combined with a dark, supernatural overtone almost seems to jump out of the screen toward you, rattling your bones but demanding your attention. Dig a bit deeper though, it becomes rather apparent that Night Light Interactive’s ghost story relies quite a bit more than it should on smoke and mirrors, eschewing compelling mechanics for comparable but uninspired design, which is less a disappointment because the end result is a menagerie of excellent and mediocre components, and more because of what it could have been.\n\nElena Elkhorn is a rather troubled young girl. Plagued by visions of her missing father, she embarks to the Willows Mansion in hopes of finding and saving him from the horrors she sees in her dreams. As it would happen, the lands the mansion are built upon exude a powerful spiritual energy, which Elena has the power to control through her family’s amulet, allowing her to project her spirit out of her body to help her on her way. Doing so quickly unveils that the mansion has a dark history, that only the spirits of the dead can still recount.\n\nIf this sounds a bit haphazardly contrived and thrown together, it’s because Whispering Willows does about as good a job introducing its characters and plot as I just attempted to. Vast portions of the narrative are taken without question or explanation, told through brief exchanges in dialog that fail entirely at turning any character into anything but a blank slate intended to advance the plot, or allowing the narrative to grow past the predictable first layer. It feels rushed and thoughtless at the best of times, and painfully written at the worst (which the cheeseball of an ending would be part of), like a book that’s had all but the most crucial parts removed.\n\nContrasting this though (and making the previous paragraph all the more complexing), is the rich backstory presented in the notes you find scattered throughout the grounds. Written mostly in the form of diary entries, they do far more to flesh out the story than anything of the dialog, creating a series of interconnected tales that all eventually fold into the present day. They are also responsible in invoking the surprisingly sinister nature of the plot, which begins as little more than a depressing history lesson but evolves to a supernatural downward spiral of one man’s grief and his tireless determination to remove it, whatever the cost.\n\nAs you make your way through the grounds of the mansion (and eventually venture inside), Elena’s power to enter spirit form come into play for more than talking to ghosts, allowing you to posses certain objects and move them from afar. It’s a mechanic with great potential, but I was a tad disappointed that for being a large part of the narrative, it’s used sparingly during actual navigation and puzzle solving. Whispering Willows also suffers a great deal from including far too much “dead space”, which is to say rooms and environments that serve no purpose but to turn you around and pad out the experience. They also caused me to get lost on a continuous basis, as with no hint or objective system there is little in the way of player direction.\n\nWhispering Willows’s biggest asset by far is its mesmerizing art design, gorgeously hand drawn and filled with character. It sets the tone for the experience while leaving enough color and childlike charm to keep from crushing you under the weight of its own wickedness. Some animations are clumsier than they could have been, and the cutscenes unfortunately plagued by slowdown (hopefully a bug that will soon be patched), but otherwise I was enthralled by the vivid look of the game and desperately hope any future projects by the developers will continue to use it.\n\nWhispering Willows is a flawed experience salvaged partially by the character present in its art design and lore. The conflicting qualities of its parts result in an uneven but not entirely worthless adventure, but one in dire need of polish and a better editor to scrape it all together into something more cohesive. I enjoyed my time at Willows Mansion, but find it difficult to recommend with sincerity to another. It has me hopeful for what the developer does next, but not entirely sure they accomplished much with their first attempt.\n\nFull disclosure: Whispering Willows was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the developer.","July 9, 2014","false","5.3"," 58 of 86 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","58","86","2","5"

I wasn't expecting a lot from it when I picked it up in a recent bundle, but I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through. It has a very polished feel to it with a lot of good going for it from its art style, musical score, sound effects, game mechanics, and even has quite a bit of humor.\n\nIt is tagged as a “horror” game, but really it falls more into the supernatural experience than true horror storytelling. While there are elements of creepiness and some scares, it is more of an uneasy feeling of dealing with ghosts and spirits than monsters. There are a couple of instances where you will be shocked, or surprised by events that creep up on you forcing you to run away from danger, but overall the atmosphere is more of a haunted house feel. The music is atmospheric to a spooky story, and fits well with old mansions and graveyards. The music is quite good overall, and mixed with some eerie sound effects you will feel some uneasiness while wandering around the game.\n\nThe game is focused on telling a story of a young girl who cannot find her father. She goes looking for him and ends up at an old mansion where it seems an old rich guy who was a mayor and founder of his town used to live and get up to some nefarious practices. Things look abandoned and filled with secrets as all the people that once resided here are long gone. You are introduced to an array of characters through notes you pick up, as well as a neat mechanic that you get almost immediately. You gain an amulet that allows you to switch to your spirit form and this form is the only way you can solve certain puzzles, or interact with other spirits you will come into contact with. You won't likely miss these as the amulet will glow and make a sound when you are near an instance that requires the swap. This is explained in a way that you are part of an Indian ancestry and that you are in a place where spirituality and otherworldly events seem to be more common. I found the story and presentation well done for the majority of the game. While there was almost no voice acting in the game you got a lot of lore for the people in it through messages you find in notes and diary entries, as well as conversations with spirits that appear as a bubble above their heads. These are all short conversations so not having a voice actor for this is no big deal. I didn't find the lack of voice acting to be a negative at all for the presentation. The girl you control does make some noises and sounds when she looks at certain things, or does certain actions at times. Even laughing at weird scenes and the like so there is some of that. The game isn't fully voiced so you will have to read a little bit at times, but never an excessive amount of more than a couple paragraphs at once in a diary entry. The ending may have been a little weak, but the journey to get there was fun and enjoyable so I still was pleased with the story overall.\n\nThe art style is well done. It reminds me of the comic book style you see in a game like Mark of the Ninja, except this is darker and more geared towards those old 1800s mansions with the background settings. The gameplay is certainly nothing like Mark of the Ninja, but the graphical style absolutely is similar. It is a 2D side scroller that will have you walking outdoors, or inside mansions and other old time grounds of a mansion like the gardens, catacombs, and guest homes. While indoors you can see a couple of floors at a time, but your room is highlighted and lit up while the other rooms are either completely dark, or just dark enough to where you can see their outlines. This too is very much like how the settings in Mark of the Ninja looked.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in the story section, you get the mechanic of turning into a spirit, which is necessary to solve certain puzzles. The way this is used makes the game pretty fun to solve these puzzles even though the puzzles themselves are very easy. You will have to use the spirit to go through walls and small cracks that you couldn’t get through yourself to pull a lever, you may have to use the spirit to possess an object so that you can move it and open a new path for you to continue, you may need it to deal with finding areas you can't find by reading hidden messages with the spirit form. While the puzzles in general were very easy throughout the game, I found the mechanics of getting around and the cleverness of using these mechanics fun. I enjoyed seeing how they would be used and it lead me to strange ways to enter and gain access to ares that seemed to be blocked before.\n\nAlthough this is considered a horror/supernatural tale, there is good amount of humor in the game. Some is clever, some very corny, and a fair bit of puns are used. The humor was fun and gave me a few chuckles as I played with there begin many instances of a dark humor to lighten the mood at times. Toss in a lttle bit of "cuteness" too and you have a little bit more appeal to the ladies probably than guys besides just the main character being a female.\n\nI would recommend this game to most adventure fans that are interested in a casual and fun experience. Normally I would want a game that is deeper meaning and serious, but I just found this game to be fun to play, cute, and well made. Lovely art style, great music and sound effects, quite a few laughs, fun mechanics in dealing with puzzles, and just a generally polished experience.\n\nThe negatives, and things I would like to see in future games from this developer would be more in depth and difficult puzzles and the possible addition of voice-acting. Another negative and something to be aware of is that during cut scenes, the game will SKIP them if you press ANY key on your keyboard. So taking a screenshot with F12 will skip the cut scene and you most likely will not be able to go back to a save before this as this has auto-saves. Also, the automatic save system with no ability to go back, like I mentioned with skipping a cut scene by pressing F12 is a must to change for future releases. Otherwise I was very satisfied with the game, and recommend it.\n\n8/10\n\nThe game works perfectly fine with the Xbox 360 Gamepad I used, including on menus (which is what FULL controller support means), so this is definitely a Big Picture game you can use from the couch.\n\nGame has Trading Cards and Achievements. Achievements are fairly easy to get with about 14/20 being story related and the other 6 being things you may want to look up before you play so that you can get them all in one playthrough.","September 17, 2014","true","13.0"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","6"

You can run when you are OUTSIDE ONLY by holding down the Shift key.\n\nYou CAN miss things if you don't take the time to explore everywhere -- don't make assumptions that what looks like a dead-end is *actually* a dead-end!  For the most part, you won't be able to miss things, however.  Any time your character touches something important, you'll get a pop-up at the top of the screen telling you to hit the Space key to pick it up, possess it, move it, or whatever interaction is necessary at the time.  You can look at your inventory at any time, but you don't actually need to -- all inventory items are automatically used when you need them.\n\nThe story is told via notes and letters that you find as you explore.  I recommend reading them immediately, and you can do so by hitting the Esc key when you find them (the game will tell you that every time you find one of them :p )  If you're not sure which character wrote the letter, just hit the Esc key -- you'll see the newest note's name highlighted.  ie. William Wortham 3/15.\n\nAs you explore you will discover and -- in your spectral form -- be able to talk to the many ghosts that populate the grounds, as well as "possess" items for a short time and squeeze through small openings.  Although these openings have little sparkles around them, I *still* managed to miss a couple.  Another way to notice those small areas is to switch to your spirit form.  When you get near one, you'll switch from your full-form to a little bluish flame.\n\nSo how do you know when to switch forms?  You are wearing an amulet, and when it starts to glow, you know that you are getting near a ghost.  Otherwise, you just need to keep an eye out for small spaces, and things that don't quite look right.\n\nYou might think that being a side-scroller, there would not be much depth to your environment, and you'd be wrong. ;)  There are multiple layers to every area you visit, not just "front" and "behind".  My preferred method of play is to fully explore an area before going through any doors or going up/down stairs, but that's not necessarily what works best in this case.  'Nuff said.\n\nYou CAN die in a few spots, but luckily you won't have to re-do much, as the automatic saves are well-spaced.  Survival is not dependent on reflexes, it's all about patience and/or moving your character to the right place.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game, and think it was definitely worth playing.","August 25, 2014","true","3.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","2"

While there is nothing forcing the player to read these notes, to neglect them would be to skip the entire point of the game.\n\nThis is because simply playing the game will not yield much enjoyment in itself. There is nothing particularly "fun" about the gameplay; the entire two to three hour experience is comprised simply of exploring the game's two-dimensional settings and "examining" your surroundings by pressing the Space bar.\n\nHowever, in spite of its simple gameplay, Whispering Willows does do a great job of telling a unique story. It does so strongly enough that I found myself interested to follow the game through to the finish while also enjoying the experience.\nWhile I really appreciated this, I understand that a lot of people do not have the patience or curiosity to play a game for its story or message alone. If you are one of those people, Whispering Willows is not for you.\n\nWhispering Willows is a great introduction for players who are interested in but not necessarily familiar with gaming as a medium of storytelling. The price may be a bit steep for a rather short game, but all in all, I really recommend this game to you if you enjoy a good story and contributing to smaller indie titles -- especially if it's on sale! ^_^","May 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Unfortunately, it's true only if you use 'beautiful' as a word for 'very pretty' or 'extremely pleasant to look at'.\nThe gameplay and puzzles are repetitive and boring. The story and writing are mediocre. You're looking at, give or take, 3 hours of walking past gorgeous backgrounds, listening to a decent soundtrack, doing same things over and over, solving a few childishly easy puzzles, dying maybe 2-4 times, hardly ever getting scared or actually caring about any of the characters.","July 14, 2014","false","4.0"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","2"

Let me break down single genres.\n\nHorror - i can´t fully agree with this tag. I know horror is wide term, and it shelters a lot of subgenres, but WW doesn't feel horrory enough for me. I am horror junkie, i watch horror movies since i was 9 years old, i played some horror games in my life as well. WW is more mysterious, and some freaky ghost won´t made this even little scary.\n\nAdventure - i might go with it. You are basically on the quest to save your father from grasp of evil spirit, so adventure is quite adequate.\n\nPuzzle - yes we have some puzzles here, and because i am dumb as pile of bricks (also i played after night shift) i had some troubles to follow even the easiest puzzles, and most of them are not so hard to solve. Just pay attention to details, and hooray.\n\nSo for me WW is more mystery/adventure puzzle game.\n\nIn terms of technical aspects, i really can´t speak about major flaws.\nI really like visual side of game, cut scenes might have been slightly better (it is just nitpicking don't bother).\nSound and music on high level and probably my favourite aspect of game.\nLength of 3 hours is appropriate and i think i would get bored if i should play for 1-2 hours more.\n\nAnd finally story. I seriously enjoy storytelling. I may not read all journal pages, but i felt people who made WW really put their focus and effort to present this twisted story as interesting as they could. Elene with my lead found out, what story is behind gigantic mansion, what happened to residents, and of course what happened to her dad. I like pace of storyline until the very end, when it all goes gooey and mushy.\n\nOverall Whispering Willows is game you can enjoy. It has great elements, and what matters most is your taste about some particular things.\n\n8/10","August 23, 2014","true","3.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","2"

Short version: It's a beautiful game that plays somewhat unintuitively, with simple mechanics. Its horror slant is certainly lacking, but that doesn't necessarily detract from the game.

The shallowness is eerily reminiscent of Atari's Haunted House. The game makes a fizzling attempt at being scary/creepy. The few puzzles the game offers require zero cranial activity. The main character may have been improved by utilizing a stronger personality, but with the limited story elements it probably wouldn't have mattered.\n\nThe character movement is unnecessarily slow. As I progressed further in the game, this slowness eventually started  giving me a feeling of "God, hurry up and end." Being able to run outside was nice, but the slow pace inside seems to be the result of a developer looking to extend an already short game. You know a game has issues when it tries its hardest to make you not want to finish it. And yet sometimes I amaze myself at my persistence, or maybe I'm mistaking that for stubbornness.","September 3, 2014","false","3.3"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","3"

They also were able to make you feel and see that something has corrupted this place. I also have to say that the spirit form in this game looked right out of a top notch comic book. Actually all the art could have come straight out of a comic book. I was also impressed with the use of doors that either brought you into a room in front or behind you. This made the at times very slow pace of the game bearable.\n\nThe sounds in the game definitely gave off the vibes of horror game. I do wish that the characters were voiced. I think that would have added a little something extra and pulled the gamer in that much more.\n\nAlright so lets talk game here, as you might have noticed I already made mention of the slow pace of the game, you are going to be walking the entire time. There is a time for running but it happens in such a small part of the game that you are going to wish you could do that elsewhere. I enjoyed the twists and turns in the story and the puzzles that had to be solved with the assistance of the ghosts that you could interact with when in spirit form. I also appreciated the fact that the puzzle aspect of the game required the spirit form to make things interesting.\n\nNow the problem with this game comes in the form of if you ever get lost or perhaps missed something big in the game, you are going to wander around, and when you do that you are going to do that in a walking form, so if you ever have a moment of clarity when you remember where you are headed you might find yourself having to do some serious backtracking/walking to get there which can definitely hurt the gaming experience. At the same time, though, if the running mechanism was in the game there's definitely a chance that you are going to miss something, either a spirit you might want to talk to or extreme danger.\n\nOne thing that I did appreciate about this game was that there were several layers to it. If you really didn't care about the story, it wasn't going to slap you constantly in the face, you could just look for the keywords in the conversations and then move on. If you were looking for an in-depth experience you could have this as well with the notes and letters lying around the game that gave you more information on the characters and the setting. There's also the middle of the road approach where you can get the story and you don't have to read those extras you find throughout the game.\n\nThis game definitely is not for everyone. There's a couple little glitches in the game when it comes to interacting with the actual mansion and triggering the chapter titles even when you are in a different chapter, but overall you're going to find a very solid game. If you are looking for something a little dark with paranormal undertones, you are going to like this game. Now there might be times where you are going to get frustrated with the walking everywhere, but if you stick with it you will find a solid game in the end. So after making it through this entire game I have to say that it deserves an 10 out of 10 from me.","July 9, 2014","true","3.8"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","2"

Certainly a huge step up from the Web-based demo I had played previously. While there are a few things that did frustrate me a bit, particularly the lack of running indoors, those are minor nitpicks when you take into account the positive aspects. The story starts off with a girl trying to find her father and she quickly discovers a mystery at the Willows mansion and her journey takes her delving into a centuries-old tale that tugs at the heartstrings.

They could'v just reduced the game's price to 9,99$ and do a 33% sale or something to do it\n\n\nSo basically I would recommend this game on full price but since I did not get it on full price so I wont, its your choice to do it I already did my best explaining what this game is about and the gameplay hours if you're fast enough, Don't get me wrong support devs is something we all love but it kinda bums me out when people buy a game on full price and a few days later it goes on a bundle for 10% of the price that also has a lot of other games.","October 6, 2014","true","7.1"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","8"

Finished it in less than 5 hours but I spent a lot of time wandering around just to see what I missed to get to the end of the chapter. It might take less time if Elena could run.\n\n+ Beautiful graphics\n+ Easy puzzles\n+ Suitable soundtrack\n+ Good premise / story\n+ Loved the notes that tell the back-stories. Wish we could read more about the other ghosts.\n+ Loved the idea that Elena has a spirit form that can solve some of the puzzles for her.\n\n- No map. A map would really be useful in this game, made too many wrong turns (or doors) when I back-tracked to try to get to an intended room.\n- Elena walked soooo slowly that it annoyed the hell out of me. I was bored while waiting for her to get from point A to point B.\n- Repetitive. It seemed like all I had to do was to pick up notes (a lot of them too) and talk to ghosts.\n- A lot of ghosts with some back stories but most of the were not memorable.\n- I wished that Elena would have a weapon to protect herself with against threats. I mean, she has powers, she should be able to do more.\n- Anti-climatic ending. At the end of the game, I was like, "That's it?!?!"\n- There's a windowed mode, but you can't click or alt-tab to desktop while in-game (linux - Ubuntu 12.04).\n\n(updated) In short: I kinda like it. It started off slow but it has a nice story progression. I was annoyed with the pace and the ending but I did enjoy the game. Recommended if you like puzzle games.

The cartoon-style presentation is very intricately delivered and playthroughs are easy on the eyes. The music is very good and adds to the chilling atmosphere - there is also a lot of ambient background noises, which all help to build up a sense of urgency for your goal - finding your dad in a creepy abandoned mansion property.\n\nThe story is actually very good, and a lot of it is provided in the form of journal entires that you can pick up. The pacing and order for the entires you receive give a multifaceted perspective on not only the plot, but also on the theme of culture clash - in particular, Western explorers/industrialists and Native indigenious tribe people.\n\nThe controls are very simple and feedback is always given on what you can do and how to do it. The beginning of the game offers a quick tutorial and the learning curve is minimal. Although the puzzles are never too challenging (many are actually very straightforward), the character's movement speed can get a little annoying - especially when you have to travel a long distance since you only walk and cannot run.\n\nGameplay proceeds at a leisurely pace - your character can activate a "ghost" form, allowing you to travel through tiny entryways (usually to activate a switch to open a locked door. As a ghost, you can also possess items like the door levers, but also things like a desk blocking a doorway, or a painting  you need to straighten. While in this form you can see other supernatural beings and talk to NPC ghost characters. Your pendant will also glow blue and the background sounds will change when a ghost is nearby; it will glow red when "enemy" or hostile characters are nearby.\n\nThere is quite a bit of walking in this game, and the slow movement speed of your player character does not help things. You can press the transformation key "Q" to teleport back to your body, which is nice since you dont have to float all the way back to yourself.\n\nA really fun, charming game. If you like puzzle adventures, give this game a try.\n\nRecommend!","August 1, 2014","true","2.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

I love the core gameplay mechanic that was chosen for the game. The mechanic is that you can press a button and your character transforms into a ghost-like form that enables you to get to places and solve puzzles that your full human form would otherwise be unable to do. Although it’s definitely not the first time that I have played a game that utilizes this form it fits the game like a glove here. It helps blend the puzzles and the story into a fascinating whole and ties the game together perfectly. This is aided by what Coke identified as a great atmosphere which I thoroughly agree with. The mood, ambience and everything that you would hope for an adventure horror game to be is at a high level.\n\nThe story itself is quite a reasonably told one. It’s one of the game’s strengths. It tells the story of a girl, Elena if you don’t change the name, who is on a journey to discover her missing father. In order to do so she will have to discover the many mysteries that haunt the Willows Mansion. The game starts relatively quickly which is a strong positive as it shows you receiving the amulet from her father which allows the core gameplay mechanic to come to life. I could delve into much deeper detail but I really don’t want to spoiler the game for you.\n\nI would argue that the biggest problem with the game is the slow movement. I don’t understand why the developers made the decision for the character’s movement not to be smoother and quicker but it is what it is – arguably the games greatest problem. The other significant problem which can be argued either way is the lack of an in game map. I can understand that it was left out for exploration and perhaps even puzzle purposes but numerous times, particularly in the catacombs, I found myself lost and frustrated with where I had to go to get to where I was supposed to be. A map would have solved this issue. The puzzles themselves tend to be on the easier end of the difficulty scale and some will take issue with that as they may not feel that the game is rewarding enough. But given that we’re discussing a few relatively minor design choices to pick the game apart with I think that says a lot about the overall quality of the game. Though the sum of those negatives does add up, of course.\n\nI recommend Whispering Willows for the adventure fans out there. The horror is on the lighter, less scarier side which adds to the game rather nicely. The game can be played from the early teens onward and there is something for almost everyone within the content.\n\nFor our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo join in our fantastic community join our Steam group","March 26","true","5.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There are a variety of animations added in that interacts with the environment that you are exploring. The colorful lighting and beautifully composed music/sound effects sets the tone and mood for the game.\n\nIn the game, when you interact with the environment, it interacts with you. Elena provides dark humor and cute jokes as you are exploring the areas. Also, her ghost states different things than her human form when you do interact with the environment. The particle effects presented are clean and vibrant. The diary and notes that you find are very well-detailed and thought out. It adds a nice past to present story when you are uncovering the truth.\n\nThe only time I wished I could run is the outside area. I never wanted to have a run animation in the enclosed area. All the other times that Elena runs are at the perfect scare moments.\n\nAlso, there doesn't really need to be a map or an objective list for this is a puzzle game. As with most puzzle games, they are suppose to be engaging and have an "Aha! experience." Players must use their memory and intellect to solve the puzzles and I think that's what the developers were intending. In modern games, I honestly feel that we get things handed out to us with maps and objective lists so it was quite nice not to have this be a part in this game.\n\nI do wish there was more interaction with possessing objects, changing the environments (like closing/opening the curtains or changing the clocks), and moving objectives in human form because this was my favorite part of the game. One other thing is that the voice for Elena was awesome and I really would of loved to hear Wortham and the other ghosts' voices in the game.\n\nI absolutely love the achievements for this game! Those were a lot of fun to do. Some of the achievements were hard to find, but it felt amazing once you did find them.","July 10, 2014","true","4.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Only cons were the text bubble noise that constantly pinged when you continued the dialogue, the absence of a running option, and the forced progression of the story making it hard to go back to get achievements if you progressed too far. I've never cared for that, but it doesn't take away from the game that much.

The\nmain story of the game comes from notes and diary entries, and it is a bit\nheavy in reading.\n\nGraphically, the game looks charming, slightly cartoon-ish, and it creates a\ntheme and atmosphere that draws you in.  The ghost animations are very well done,\nbut there is a disconnect on the motivations and back story of the main\ncharacter; the game assumes you know things that would be helpful to know, and\nadd another element to that character.\n\nUnfortunately, the excess of save points take away from any sense of meaning when\nbattling monsters, and gives you a feeling that if you die, oh well, you can just\nmove along to the next thing.  The levels are mazelike, and designed to drag out\nthe experience, instead of complementing the atmosphere. Only made worse with the slow walking inside buildings.  While the main mechanic of this game, being able to become spectral, is a good one, it is overused to the point of becoming tedious.\n\nThe puzzles are oversimplified, and while the story and level design complement\neach other, they also make you feel as if you are doing mindless repetitive\nbusywork before you are permitted to continue.\n\nUnfortunately, the combination of all these thing takes away from immersion into\nthe game.

It's beautiful 2-D animation, and the artists should really be commended for making something so damn pretty. The world is very immersive for a side-scroller. I enjoyed Elena's little comments about the objects around her, even though most of them didn't have much to do with the plot.\n\nThe plot was decent. The story was uncomplicated, but it was revealed in an interesting way. I found the ending to be a little too neat and tidy, but I'm a bit of a stickler for storytelling. Overall, it was an enjoyable couple of hours of story. As everyone else has said, it's not a horror game, so much as a ghost story game with spooky elements. That doesn't mean it's not good, but if you want hardcore horror, go find another game.\n\nThe game mechanics were simple, but as the emphasis was on story that wasn't really a problem for me. I didn't find the puzzles that challenging, though they were still enjoyable. It doesn't have a lot of replay value, as it's going to follow the same plot everytime and there's no real challenge to the puzzles, but I'll probably play it again at somepoint to finish up the achievements.\n\nI'd also recommend picking it up on sale, if you can.

I don't know about the other people that have played the game till now but the haunting music of the game really shoved horror under my skin. And I've really loved it for doing this to me! Nowadays, you get to see less and less games that can really have an impact on you. It's nice to see one of these games once in a while.\nIn this game you play as Elena. A young little girl that is looking for her missing father. You learn while playing the game that he disappeared when he was working at the Willows Mansion. As the game progresses, you'll need to find clues which will show you what happened with him and where he went exactly from there. While doing that, you'll get to do unspeakable things, like talking to ghosts, transforming yourself into one of them or even resolving a lot of puzzles.\nThe core concept of the game is that you're capable of leaving your body to another realm through the amulet which you've received from Elena's father. In which you can communicate with spirits, possess objects or even get scared of demons. The story it's very interesting as it’s one of the game’s strengths. And if you want to get the full access of it, you'll have to read all the notes that are scattered around the map. These notes are well-written and help bring the game to life. While there is nothing forcing the player to read the notes, to neglect them would be to skip the entire message of the game.\nThe game also does an interesting job at delving into the Native American folklore, which was interesting to see unfold through the course of the game.\n\n\nPros- Support for Achievements and Trading Cards.\n- Haunting music which fits to the game, creating an atmosphere and ambience that you would rarelly get from an adventure game. The sound is good too, there are some good ambient sounds in the environment. The game is not fully voiced but the character's groans and sounds work well within the game.\n- Auto-saving system. You'll have all your progress saved everytime you enter a new room.\n- Beautifully drawn artwork, I really like how hard they've worked on the design of the characters.\n- Nice unique concept that will keep you tied to the game.\n- If you're an achievement hunter, you'll love this one from the bottow of the heart. The achievements are easy to find and get a 100%, though some are hidden and might require you replay the game, but even so, it's a fun game to play.\n- Around a few hours of delights.\n- You will get to know some pretty interesting and macabre stories about the people who once used to live at the Willows Mansion.\n- A lovely puzzle design that's not very challenging, I can promise you that you will not rage while playing this nice game.\n- You have an awesome supernatural power!\n- The graphics are very nice! Nice lighting effects matched with textured objects. Unique rooms, interesting sights, the style the game has it's definitely one of the best elements.\n\nCons- No support for Steam Cloud.\n- You don't have a map which can tell you where are you in the game. You'll find yourself lost and frustrated a couple of times if you're a scatterbrain like me.\n- Slow movement that drags the game down, it feels a bit strange.\n- There are enemies into the game, but they're so few and far between.\n\nConclusionThis is a great game for those who are into adventure games. And the game it's not even very challenging, you can relax while playing it and it has something for almost everyone within it's content. I cannot recommend it at it's full price due to the short length. You can actually finish it in less than 4 hours, but if you'll find it in a sale, don't think anymore about it, just purchase it. Whispering Willows blends elements of puzzle, visual novel, and point-and-click games which it's unique and satisfactory. While the gameplay may be a bit simple, the game compensates with the complex story and good artwork it has. Whispering Willows gets an 4.5/5 from me.\n\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Night Light Interactive for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

Not a whole lot is different between the Ouya and Steam versions. However, due to feedback from Steam users, the devs have added controller support and the option to have the main protoganist, Elena, run. This was one of my biggest complaints of the Ouya version even with the devs saying they created the game for players to take their time, soaking in the world - hence walking.\n\nDon't expect your typical horror game, but a puzzle adventure game. Collecting notes and reading diary entries is a big part of the game to uncover much of the backstory. The puzzles can be tricky, however, they don't seem to progress as one would expect. Visually, Whispering Willows can be stunning, especially with its cutscenes full of hand drawn artwork.\n\nIf you're one of the lucky, or unlucky ones, that own a Ouya, Whispering Willows is "free" with in-app purchases on the console. I would suggest trying out what you can to see if it's the game for you, or hey, it's currently in a bundle for $1.00, so...you could always do that.\n\nIf you want to read more about what I thought about Whispering Willows, you can read my Ouya review here: http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/1061/whispering-willows","August 21, 2014","true","1.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Story is interesting, it relies mostly on reading the notes scattered around and the up to 4 hours the game will take is just about perfect duration for this kind of adventure.\n\nI played it with xbox controller, and it worked quite well, but the control hints displayed are for keyboard.\n\nThe full price of 23 EUR for the game, soundtrack and some pictures seems very steep to me, so I can see how that can discourage a lot of people from trying this out.\n\nFor the next 7 days after this review you can still get it as part of Groupees Be Mine 14 bundle, so I recommend you to grab it while you can.","August 24, 2014","true","3.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saffronp/recommended/288060/","saffronp","Saffron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saffronp/","94 products in account","This game is a tough one to review. I'll start out by saying that I did enjoy this game as a whole. If you enjoy psychological horror, and are patient enough to deal with a bit of trial-and-error playing, then it's easy enough to look past some of the game's issues and truly enjoy it.\n\nRegardless of the fact that, in theory, this seemed like a perfect game for me, in practice, there were definitely some hits and misses in the experience that kept it from meeting its potential. I'll start off with some of the negatives. The first thing you see in the game,  even before the menu screen, is a short cutscene which is fashioned like a slideshow, as opposed to a fully animated cutscene. The problem, in my opinion, is the art in said cutscenes. Compared to the gorgeous character animation within the game, the art for the cutscenes looked rushed and inconsistent. The coloring in these scenes was jarring to the eye compared to some of the richly-designed environments found in the game. It's certainly a forgivable aspect of the game, but I personally found that it would take me out of the otherwise immersive gaming experience, creating a choppy transition from scene to gameplay.\n\nMy second issue is again rather minor, but is nonetheless something that affected my gameplay. On two occasions, I found myself at a total loss as to what I had to do next. I spent a good amount of time wandering around the area aimlessly until I finally just decided to look at a walkthrough. It had gotten to the point where I was no longer engaged, just annoyed, which is tragic considering that I am an avid puzzle fan who enjoys a good challenge. It is a fine line between giving the player a fulfilling obstacle to overcome, and presenting the player with something that they're just happy to be done with.\nFinally, my last issue is the final chapter. It isn't bad, but I don't think it gave the game the ending it deserved. For all of the atmospheric dread that had characterized the entire game, the ending felt a little too Disney for me.\n\nBut now that I have said all of this terrible stuff, I want to emphasize what I really enjoyed about the experience. As mentioned above, I was wowed by the interiors of the various buildings I had to explore in-game, and the rotted portrayal of what should be ordinary makes me think of Freud's theory of the Uncanny. The character design of the various haunts we meet along the way were by far my favorite part of the game – in fact, I wish we had learned more about some of these characters, or at least have been able to send them off in peace ( as we got to do with some characters). I really enjoyed the intricacy of the story that I was presented with, but I don't think enough questions were answered (considering how neatly the ending seemed to tie the whole thing up). And, of course, make sure you have the sound on when you play; this game flaunts incredible sound design.\n\nOverall, Night Light has debuted on the scene with a good start. I think the reason that there are so many things many reviewers keep pointing out is that, well, we really want this game to be great. You've got the beginnings of something great, and I think that making small adjustments here and there could actually make a huge difference.\n\nSo if you do decide to buy the game, take it with a grain of salt. It's no masterpiece, but I considered it worth the fairly short amount of time I ended up investing in it. It's not gonna be perfect, but you'd be hard pressed to deny that Night Light has come out to a very good start, all things considered.\nI look forward to seeing what else you guys come up with. You've got the creativity, the thought, the concept; troubleshoot from here and you'll be golden.\n\n7/10","July 16, 2014","true","5.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Whispering Willows is an atmospherically well done adventure game. It is not so much a horror game as a horror themed game with some scary bits strewn about.\nGameplay is a bit slow which discourages the player a bit from exploring the beautifully drawn levels which are even further enhanced by a fittingly atmospheric soundtrack.\nDespite the slow gameplay, the pacing is is done well, especially near the beginning and end of the game which benefits such a short game that can be completed on a first run in under 4 hours.\nA negative point would be the lack of actual universe building. The player meets a lot of ghosts and finds various notes, letters and journals during the game yet a lot of your supernatural new friends seem either boring or like developer cameos if they do not play a central role in the story. That's is definitely a missed opportunity where this game could have shined. Give the ghosts a little backstory. For example there is a piano player who lost his sheet music which you'd have to bring back to him but then there is an ex-person just outside a building who serves no other function as to give you a hint to an otherwise already obvious puzzle which solves itself as you progress through the story.\nAnother point would be the difficulty. Now I don't want to say that it's bad for the game to be easy but players should not look for difficult puzzles in this game. Nevertheless the lack of frustrating puzzles makes the story more enjoyable and the pacing work better.\n\nI'd recommend this game to all people who prefer a more light hearted, romantic approach to ghosts and horror than the r-rated kind. It's reminds me strongly of Luigi's Mansion for the Gamecube in both setting and atmosphere.","September 3, 2014","true","4.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

The atmsophere is quite good, but the writing when it comes to dialogue is serviceable which for a more narrative driven adventure game like this  ends up being a detriment. The lore is good though. Puzzles are also quite easy and its pretty disappointing that the Metroidvania elements are rather barebones, because I really would love some more narrative driven Metroidvanias like Waking Mars. Looking more into it though this seemed to be the devs first big game and one on a Kickstarter budget and it really feels like that.  On the bright side, hopefully Night Lite can really improve on their next game because for a rookie outing, Whispering Willows is a solid start.","September 8, 2014","true","2.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

In it you play as Elena, who is looking for her father. Elena has powers that allow her to spirit-walk (or astral-project, as you may want to call it), which will help her solve puzzles, talk to ghosts, and help them move on. The game has some basis of Native American folklore, which might make it of particular interest to some.\n\nAlthough the game is fairly simple and short, it has a lot going for it.\nThe story is interesting enough, though to get the full impact of it you really need to read all the notes you find, and not just skip them. The 2D graphics quite beautiful in their simplicity, yet still detailed enough in the backgrounds that you find yourself noticing all those little special things. The soundtrack and sounds are quite fitting the mood of the game throughout.\n\nIn Whispering Willows you're searching for your missing father at the Willows Mansion, which is full of secrets and ghosts and passageways. You will spend most of your time moving around the maps trying to find items, secrets and such, sometimes on your body, sometime by spirit walking.\nThe puzzles aren't too easy, but they're also not incredibly hard, making them just about the right spot where you won't necessarily feel compelled to quit or look up the answer, but will also not find it immediately for most of them. Some do require quite a bit of backtracking though, and when I played the game you could only walk and not run. I hear this has been fixed now, as the developer is very present on the forums.\n\nIt can be a bit easy to get lost as it has several locations, and at the time of playing it the game had no map system (I don't think it's been added, but I'm not sure) which had me backtracking and getting lost in a few parts.\nThe game might also seem a bit slow to some, though if you're used to Adventure games, the pacing shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThe replay value of this game is decent - you will probably want to play it again at some point, but likely not soon after finishing it.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a short, more paranormal than horror story with a good story.","August 29, 2014","true","4.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/288060/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","Whispering Willows is an intriguing horror/adventure puzzle game that takes cues from Native American lore to bring the "haunted mansion" levels so often seen in RPGs to the forefront of the story. The game is about Elena, a girl whose father went missing and who keeps getting nightmares about his disappearance. Determined to find him, she sets off to the mansion, but it turns out that the Ghostbusters hadn't exactly come here yet. (There's actually an achievement referencing this, so I'm allowed to make that joke! :P)\n\nThe best part of Whispering Willows has got to be its aesthetic. I absolutely love the art style of this game; everything is so beautifully rendered, from Elena to her spirit to the environment and all of the buildings and effects. Even torches and fireplaces look absolutely magnificent.\n\nUnfortunately, that's pretty much it for the good. The story is extremely bland; there's no voice acting besides some sounds in the cutscenes, and little is actually said by any of the characters that talk to Elena. She herself doesn't seem to have any lines besides the aforementioned cutscenes. Outside of the intro cutscene, there isn't much to what's going on, and it's just "solve this mystery, now solve this mystery, oh hey someone's chasing you".\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are there, but even these are under-utilized. What Whispering Willows allows players to do is take control of Elena's spirit separate from her body, using it to get through tight spaces or possess items or switches to help Elena advance. Unfortunately, this isn't used enough times, and it feels like a gimmick more than anything when you do have to use it. Most of the time it's just used to talk to characters that don't really add much.\n\nProbably the worst part of the game is its pacing. It feels like everything is happening so slowly... Elena walks too slow, or there's too many corridors, or there's too many levers, or you don't know what to do next because almost nothing is explained to you, or usually a combination of all of that. I was getting really bored really fast. Not to mention, every time I tried to press the SHIFT key to start running and speed things up, Elena turned to me and refused. It's like Elena wants to admire the scenery of human bones more than I do.\n\nIt's still regarded as a really good game by the few people who have reviewed it, so don't let my experiences completely shroud your potential of playing this game. Especially if you're looking for something based off of Native American lore; there's plenty of that in the journal entries.","December 28, 2014","false","1.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

He has been kidnapped, and you have to gather clues to find him. You explore a spooky mansion and its surroundings, where you will encounter many original characters. There's tons of letters to collect and read, which I highly recommend that you take your time to do. It will reveal some pretty interesting and macabre stories about the people who once used to live there.\n\nWhispering Willows is a short and sweet sidescroller. I cannot recommend it at its full price due to the length. It only took me about 3.5 hours to finish it, and I was being thorough and slow trying to read everything and finish all the achievements. Speaking of achievements, if you're an achievement hunter you'll love this one. They're easy to find and get a 100%, though some are hidden and might require you replay the game.\n\nI didn't have any expectations going into this, although I thought it was going to be more of a horror game than it actually is. The atmosphere is definitely eerie, with a superb soundtrack and cool art style. There's no jumpscares in this, or any scares really. I thought the stories from the letters was the creepiest part of the game.\n\nAll in all; I loved this game and you should definitely try it out, but pick it up on a sale.","March 18","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game walks a fine line between an adventure game about a young girl exploring a spooky old mansion, and a scary story told around a campfire, and does it quite well.\n\nThe story sucks you in. You play as a 13 year old native american girl named Elena looking for her father, who has gone missing some days earlier. The last place he was seen was the old mansion where he is groundskeeper. Investigating with a shamanistic power passed down from her ancestors (astral projection, I think), she finds that the history of the mansion, and the town she lives in, is darker and more sinster than she ever could have imagined. The story is told through conversations with the spirits that haunt the mansion, as well as diary entries Elena writes and notes found on the grounds. Fortunately, you don't have to look hard for the next piece of the story. I found them all in one playthrough.\n\nThe art was beautiful, from the cute little spirit form your character has, to the friendly but often times horrorific looking ghosts (Lets just say, it's usually very easy to tell how they died), to the set pieces of the rundown old mansion and its grounds.\n\nPuzzles aren't difficult and usually consist of, go here, get item, take item there, get another item, etc., but this is dispersed between a few environmental puzzles, like using your spirit form to access rooms you couldn't otherwise get to, and a couple that require some thought/observation.\n\nThe music and sound effects were wonderful, setting the mood quite well. Creaking floors, thunder and lightining, ghostly whispers, haunting music, all made for an amazing experience that really helped set the mood.\n\nThe only gripes I have with the game are the length (But that's my complaint about almost any game I enjoy :p ), and the fact that Elena is apparently so well mannered that she won't run indoors.\n\nAll in all, if you want a short, but excellent story, you can't go wrong with Whispering Willows.","January 6","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as a young girl who decides to run off and hunt for her missing father at a supposed haunted mansion. Using a necklace that you were given by that very father that had been passed down for generations, you can separate your body and soul to solve puzzles and talk to wandering ghosts.\n\nThe puzzles are somewhat simplistic from the ones I did and thankfully they did not spike in difficulty early on. The art style, while cartoonish, I feel makes it feel a bit unique. As a flagship game, I'd give it a strong 86/100, not the 65/100 metacritic score.\n\n\nI've done a video impression on my YouTube channel, known as Neo Tanner. I'll link the video below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRbbD9lTUnY\n\nI've played more than 20 minutes, just to get more feel of the game.

One thing this game excels strongly in is its storytelling, the majority of which comes in the form of notes written by the mansion's deceased retainers.\nSupporting this storytelling device, is this game's fantastic atmosphere.  I'm not one to get spooked easily, but the beautiful artwork and chilling scenery admittedly worked its magic on me and made me jump more than once.  Some may complain about it's "slowness" but I feel that the limiting of running hightens the game's suspense and when you actually DO run, it is with good reason story-wise.\n\ntl;dr: not a "quick" game, but the chilling atmosphere, good pacing, and interesting story make for a great adventure.","July 31, 2014","true","6.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/recommended/288060/","maghook","Maghook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maghook/","1308 products in account","How can a game this day and age not support 16:10 resolutions? I have to play in windowed mode so the screen isn't distorted, which detracts from any immersion now that I can see everything on my desktop around the edges of the game. I tried to find a .ini file that would let me manually set the resolution but there doesn't seem to be an easy way around it. Going by the file structure it looks like this game was made in Unity, which should automatically support all common resolutions out of the box, I have no idea how the developer managed to impose such restrictions.\n\nEntering and exiting a menu will restart the song playing on the main screen. Very jarring and sort of hilarious to hear the starting piano note "gong" constantly when changing the settings or reading notes. The cinematic before reaching the main menu is exactly the same as the cinematic when starting a new game, it's a silly bit of redundancy for those who like to sit and watch an opening cinematic in each of their games. You can use a controller but icons for the buttons continue to show up as a keyboard's bindings instead of a joypad's, this is another simple issue that could easily be fixed in the Unity engine.\n\nThe quality of the illustrations used are pretty high. Characters and backgrounds stand out quite nice, especially when the protagonist transforms into a spirit. The only downside is that the poor animation holds the game back. It seems like animations are running at 12 frames per second or less, typical for a cartoon like The Simpsons or Family Guy, but here they aren't as fluid or flexible. I'm reminded of point-and-click adventure games from the late '90s, but even then the movement of characters in games like The Curse of Monkey Island had some top notch animation despite being faced with limitations at the time.\n\nThe sound design leaves a lot to be desired. Flickering flames sound more like someone blowing softly into a microphone than crackling fire. Two or three types of footsteps and a droning, ambient soundtrack filled with tribal percussion and piano keys is all that you will hear for a significant portion of the game. Upon investigating an item the character will usually let out a strange sigh, whether it being one of relief or fear I can't quite tell.\n\nExploration is a chore, a tedium that should have been left back in the '90s. Every door you'll come across will be locked in some way or another, requiring you to move from room to room and location to location in the hopes that at least one of these doors you come across will be accessible. Then you'll find an item only to be forced to backtrack in order to open the first locked door, where you'll find another item that opens the fifth locked door, and then solve a puzzle that opens the third locked door. Repeat, ad nauseum. Madness.\n\nThere aren't enough opportunities that let you take advantage of the spiritual transformation mechanic. Its only purpose is to slow you down, whether through obfuscation or other means; there will be rooms with tiny holes that only your spirit can pass through but you'll have to keep a keen eye out as they're easy to walk past. Sometimes you'll use this power to speak with other spirits yet they generally won't divulge any beneficial clues or information that you couldn't have worked out yourself.\n\nWhispering Willows is a slow and tiresome game to explore. It would have been better suited as a typical point-and-click adventure game, it certainly fits the mould so I am unsure as to why the developer chose the method that they did.\n\nEdit: If you're going to vote this down, tell me why you disagree with my unpopular recommendation.","August 2, 2014","false","3.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/augmental/recommended/288060/","augmental","Augmental","http://steamcommunity.com/id/augmental/","104 products in account","A friend of mine bought this game after I expressed interest in it since the puzzle mechanics looked a lot like the ones in Ghost Trick, and while I did have fun playing the game, there were some difficulties to be had with it.\n\n**SPOILERS AHEAD**\n\nFirst off, while I didn't run into a lot of glitches in my playthrough, getting Elena up and down stairs was ocassionally finicky when it came to placement, which can get sort of annoying. I also don't understand why the choice was made to have her unable to run around indoors, but that's just me. When Elena loses her powers halfway through the game, it really puts a damper on the fun of it all, not to mention it seems unecessary cop out and sort of ruins the purpose of having the powers as a prominent showcase if you're just not going to use them in the second half of the game. Puzzles involving interesting mechanics like this shouldn't be shoved into the corner for the climax of the game only to be brought out to do one or two things at the end.\n\nSecondly, as far as story goes, the game is a little... lacking. It starts out well enough, and a reversal of the Dad Looks For Missing Daughter trope is always welcome. It even continues fairly well with the way that you were able to help a few of the people who's lives Wadsworth ruined in his mad attempts to speak to his wife again. While I liked that you could reconcile Darby and Skyflower, I had a problem with the fact that Elena couldn't explain to Fleur that Wadsworth was kind of ♥♥♥♥, or that you couldn't find out more about the veritable ♥♥♥♥ing menagerie of ghosts milling about the mansion.\n\nIt also makes no sense that Wadsworth is showing her the suffering that he's had to go through in his life, but despite it not really being time travel and basically being projections in his own mind, Elena can still somehow alter events and give him knowledge of what could have happened when none of the characters have a reason to know any of this stuff at all. And in addition to that, after seeing that his own greed and desperation to see Martha again lead to a genocide, the murder of two people he'd loved, and the probable neglect of his son, to have him be able to flit off to the afterlife scott-free (especially since Elena's nonsensical foray into what could have been doesn't actually change the fact that he killed two people and slaughtered her ancestors) is unsatisfying and anticlimactic. While it's all well and good for us to consider the nature of good and evil, setting up the Big Bad of your game as an admittedly realistic portrayal of the attitude taken during Western Expansion in the U.S. and then having it turn out to be some mysterious dark lady-shaped force posessing him for no reason is just disappointing.\n\nFinally, merging those two points, I feel like the game could have been stretched out a little more if the random ghosts had been given little miniquests or something that would allow you to accomplish certain tasks for rewards (e.g. tellings about hte history of the mansion, turning the notes or locations of notes into rewards, making it a little harder to get the keys by having a miniquest needing to be done first, etc.). There could have also been more variety in the puzzles and a more satisfying resolution to the story.\n\nOverall, I do reccomend playing the game, because it's actually pretty short, pretty fun, and Elena is a very likeable character. Even with all the flaws it has, it's still worth a run-through at least once.\n\nHonestly though, if you did like this game, I highly reccomend picking up Ghost Trick for the Nintendo DS. It's an older game that has a similar gimick that it does much better, and it's the reason I picked this up in the first place.","December 20, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Certainly the puzzles aren't anything two write home about, given that the main challenge for the two that I had trouble with was finding it in the first case, and a very specific physical placement in the other.\n\nRather, where Whispering Willows shines is in the exploration of new areas and, more importantly, the backstory of various characters, communicated via notes found in the mansion and its grounds.  These add a lot to the world, and give context for what's going on in this admittedly creepy environment.\n\nThe biggest downsides to the game is the art in the cutscenes which, while not terrible, isn't particularly great either, and the fact that if you're killed by monsters, which at some points is tremendously easy to do, you can find yourself transported quite a ways back, requiring you to start again, including some interminable waits for monsters to finish their paths.\n\nOn the whole, I would definitely recommend the game.

It's got some great art and some so-so art. It's got important things to say about human relationships and real-world history, presented in a two-dimensional way. It's got an interesting mechanic, and the most interesting thing they do with that mechanic is to force you to cope when it's suddenly turned off. It has puzzles, but let's just say it's not trying to be Myst. It's not especially long... although I disagree with the reviews that rage about the walking speed. I felt that the speed was good, and helped me to really take in the atmosphere and feel some tension and danger. There's a story here, and the game ends properly when the story has been told.\n\nI have to admit that, for the time I spent playing, I was fully absorbed in the little world that this game creates. It's not terribly ambitious... but it does a good job at what it tries to be. Overall I would recommend waiting until a sale, but if you enjoy atmospheric exploration, then Whispering Willows will likely be worth your time and money.","January 6","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much of the story is presented through written notes found littered about the setting in typically inexplicable fashion and the writing here is indifferent at best and introduces themes and ideas which are never elaborated on.\n\nWhile the game’s puzzles are straightforward and not very challenging the climax of the game still stands out as trivially easy as it gives the player explicit on-screen text prompts on exactly what to do.

The graphics are lovely, the mood is atmospheric, and the soul projection mechanic is creative and interesting.  Unfortunately, to paraphrase Stein, there's not much there there.  The game mostly consists of exploring rooms looking for (sometimes literal) keys to unlock doors in order to progress, while reading the scattered notes to understand the story.  Unlike other games in the genre, there are barely any puzzles to solve, and the game really holds your hand, telling you exactly where to go next and what buttons to push to advance, even up to the final "battle." With the walking speed increase, the game can be fully completed in less than 3 hours.  The story isn't bad, but it comes to an end pretty abruptly just as things are getting interesting.

In fact, if it was my first time playing this game, the best advice I could be given is to set aside 2-3 hours of nighttime and set to it. The game does an excelent job at creating the perfect atmosphere for what it intends. I think the easiest way to describe the atmosphere is with the word 'eerie', with well timed music and the creaking and cracking of old buildings, the whispers that you think you hear at night all provide an excellent setting. The game is fairly straght forward with the only choice I found myself having to make was which room to explore first.\n\nIn my opinion there are a few down sides, first for a game that took me 1.5-2 hours to complete the price is rather steep seeing as there isn't much replayability(having completed it on the first playthrough). Secondly for those who watched the trailers, or have played the game, the black ghosts don't have much of a role in the game. Don't get me wrong, when the black ghosts come its fairly heart racing, but I was just expecting them to appear more often and for my character to have to hide from them in some hole or cupboard(though there seem to be plenty of games with that included already, so maybe less of a downside).\n\nAll in all it's a really good game, 2-3 hours worth of play time. Again, since there isn't much replayability I would suggest waiting for the game to go on sale, or for the price to drop a tad.\n","March 24, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is interesting and you really do feel compassion for the characters but there are some elements of the plot that felt rushed and left a lot of unanswered questions. This is especially true near the end, where a lot of new developments were kind of just thrown out there without getting any proper explanation. Not even a casual "Oh yeah and this is what happened here". Just... nothing. This left the story feeling a bit unfinished, though the depth earlier in the game makes up for this well enough.\n\nThe audio in this game is great and definitely helps to give off a creepy vibe that keeps you, at the very least, unnerved. The music, especially, is lovely and fits perfectly with the genre of horror. It's not a terribly scary game when you get down to it, but I'm not really a big fan of super scary games. For me, it had just the right amount of creepy to make me jump and get my heart pounding without actually freaking me out so much that I never open the game again (which has happened a lot in the past).\n\nMy only concern with the game is the bugginess of the movement. If you go in one direction for too long the game will get stuck on it and keep you moving even after you've stopped pushing the arrow key. Definitely annoying (and quite terrifying) when you need to turn and run from a monster, but Elena keeps strolling straight for it. The stairs, though not necessarily buggy, could be difficult to ascend when placed right on top of one another, as it was hard to line Elena up in the exact same spot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekanji/recommended/288060/","tekanji","Miss Andri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekanji/","186 products in account","IN A NUTSHELL: I picked up and finished the game tonight, and I'll echo what others are saying: great atmosphere, good-for-the-most-part (but underdeveloped) story, so-so game mechanics, and WAY too short. However, despite my issues with it the game was a fun play. Also, since the last time I've reviewed something Steam has started requiring the recommend/not recommend button (WHY, STEAM? WHY???), so I'm going to give this a thumbs down BUT I do have to say that--while I can't recommend getting it for full price--I still think it's worth picking up if it's on sale or in a bundle.\n\nMORE DETAILED REVIEW:\n**WARNING: MILD SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW**\nFirst, regarding the length of the game: 3 hours (4 at MOST if you want to get all the easter eggs) for a 15 USD game is, in my opinion, unacceptably short. For 10 USD games, I expect at least 8 hours of gameplay. For a $15 one, I'd say that anything under 10 hours is too short. In this case, I would have liked to see additional content that further developed the story and fleshed out the characters beyond the 2 dimensional fetch-quest style dialogue. I would also have liked to see some more challenging puzzles. In general, puzzles should take time to work out intellectually NOT (as was the case with the wine puzzle) in figuring out the basic mechanics of the puzzle or (in the case of the Knight puzzle) in having to adjust it multiple times to get it to be "perfect". As another reviewer mentioned, having some puzzles with multiple solutions would have been nice as well.\n\nStory wise, while I was fairly invested in the dead residents of the Willows estate, I felt like all the characters were fairly stereotyped and thus felt very two-dimensional. I also felt that the pacing was poor; in particular I was disappointed by the lack of any real story development after the first time Elena finds her father. I know that the point of that chapter was to play through a part where you're unpowered, but I would have much prefered more gameplay where Elena slowly powered up by, for instance, helping the rest of the ghosts on the estate.\n\nI also am not sure how I feel about the ending. It's like, dead racist white dude murderer learns the "error" of his ways and gets to wander off into the afterlife with the only real consequences is that he feels bad that he made the wrong life choices? The most flattering thing I can say about that ending is that it was "unsatisfying". Seriously, murderous racist white men don't need redemption arcs that fail to hold them properly accountable for their atrocities. We get enough of that in real life, I'd rather not have it interfering with my fantasy.","February 27, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was actually a kickstarter supporter of this project, but like many kickstarter projects, they sound better on paper than they are in execution.\n\nThis is not to say this is a bad game. The story is charming, the 2D art is incredibly well drawn, and the music is appropriately creepy. This is Night Light studios' first foray into gaming, and they did a decent job.\n\nThe overall experience was lacking in a few areas, however. The puzzles are quite simple, your character is rarely in any kind of danger and there's a lot of backtracking involved. This can get tiresome when considering Elena's plodding walking pace (though I hear a subsequent patch has fixed this).\n\nThe game is also quite short. You're looking at about five hours of play, so keep that in mind before you decide to spend your money.\n\nIf you're a fan of adventure games, you'll probably like Whispering Willows, but I think that the full price tag is perhaps a little high for this game. I'd recommend putting it on your wishlist and waiting for a sale.","December 16, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I hope all the indians rise up and kill the girl at the end. 2.5/5\n\nEDIT: Ok half-a55ed detailed review:\nNote that i only played half of the game up to the end of Chapter 3 where i found out i had 2/3 flowers.\n\nArt: 9/10\nFor 2D, the walking animations and the ghost form was really eye catching. The background art and characters were detailed as well, which i loved, and the mix with the quirky storyboard frames made it kind of dynamic somehow.\n\n\nStory: 5/10\nThe story was kind of a drag. Although the back-story was extremely cohesive and rich and helped to keep me playing on, the game's introduction to the story was too fast, and I missed out on why we were looking for Elena's father, until i redownloaded the game to watch the intro(there was only 1 frame-her father is the missing grounds keeper lol taken away by ghosts). I thought a bit more could be explained if I played on, but that wasn't even a real issue.\n\nGameplay: 5/10\nIn the end, I kept on playing for 1+ hours because of the art/ambience, but the uninspiring story line and tedious, unrewarding and seemingly unrelated tasks made me want to stop playing altogether. I estimated the story would not get better, and that the first half of the game would be an accurate depiction for the latter half. The maze and memory element of the game is enjoyable up to a point, but if you miss something it becomes annoying.\n\nI know this is a somewhat ignorant review as I only played half of the game, and the issue of giving up in frustrating games is common-but some recommendations I would like to make are:\n\n-give more clues to what I need to do to advance to the next chapter-maybe if i walk around finding the next clue for 15+ minutes, make a hint available so I don't have to look up a walkthrough. - the notes were good clues, but sometimes not enough. I can't remember the exact tasks, but one was turning the clock to just before 4, and the other was returning to Darby after i uncovered something-to-do-with-him-in-the-past which took me 15+ minutes each to figure out. The last straw was the 2/3 flowers where i cbf to find out where I went wrong as I was sure i talked to every ghost and poked at every corner of this gigangasaur maze.\n\n-make the tasks more rewarding somehow- the piano notes task was a really nice touch.\n\n-other tiny issues, make transform animation faster/smoother, make going up down stairs controls better somehow\n\nTLDR: 5.5/10. good art. ok story. some tasks unrewarding, some tasks unclear and dull. maze puzzle element was enjoyable, but frustration>reward. Would recommend to play, would not recommend to pay.","March 18, 2015","false","1.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","4","8","2","2"
