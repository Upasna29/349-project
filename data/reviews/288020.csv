If this appeals to you, you are probably about sold, but just let me continue.\n\nIf you are familiar with the way Capcom retreaded the NES style Mega Man series, you might be aware that it included more instant death traps than any game previously.  Well, this game is filled with those things as well, and you'll be quite aware of that by the time you start getting into the depths that this game offers.  Because this game is harder than any of the games I've mentioned so far.  And you know what, maybe that's your thing.  Frankly, I'm OK with that.  The nice thing is that the game takes advantage of years of experience to know what kind of classic mistakes that old games can...  Oh, what, there's a lives system?  Well then.\n\nIn truth, the lives are not as bad as it seems.  You can die several times but when you run out, it's not start-over game over.  In fact, you end up in a room, progress saved, but you will have to find your way back to your last location.  This is not necessarily an enormous detriment...  except it is VERY spare on teleport locations, and some parts of the game...  you are going to die plenty.  This can lead to rather a few revisits to rooms that probably killed you a couple times as well. If you haven't stocked up enough lives, you might be in pretty big trouble. I will say this to their benefit, though: there are many rooms where you can flick a switch to remove an energy barrier that lets you take a shortcut through the room to skip parts of it, but even then you'd still have to make your way through some tricky bits.  I don't even want to think about how many times I died in some sections so far, and I'm about 2/3s of the way through.\n\nThe thing is though, these levels are quite well designed.  I feel like a connoiseur of platformers would be able to appreciate this, but unless you are a master, you have to be prepared for grinding through some particularly nasty bits to get further.\n\nSo basically, if you have not been frightened away by this idea, and possibly if you don't get frustrated easily, give this a go.\n\nI should also note, great visual assets and a wonderful soundtrack.  If that pushes you over the edge, great, but if not, don't say I didn't warn you ;)","August 10, 2014","true","31.8"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","38","41","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/288020/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Another excellent retro love-letter for those riding the current wave of nostalgia hitting the indie scene via the likes of Freedom Planet or Shovel Knight, Rex Rocket takes the metroidvania formula we all know and love and layers it with an old-school charm that is impossible to resist.\n\nRex Rocket is the story of a lone space captain, left in the ruins of what was once a thriving and bustling space vessel transporting scores of important and renown scientists. What happened here to turn technology against its human creators? It's up to you to blast, explore and platform your way through the now overrun S.S. Montana in a fun and humorous throwback to the greatest period in gaming history with a few twists of its own.\n\nThe combat in Rex Rocket is much flashier and faster paced than the classics we remember as you rush into different sectors of your doomed ship each more deadlier than the last, with guns blazing. The speed of your shots as well as the attacks of your oncoming foes is lightning-quick, and you'll take advantage of the extremely tight controls and employ ninja-like techniques such as wall-jumping or propelling yourself over gaps using your gun as a jetpack. The possibilities are endless to how each player will handle any given situation.\n\nThe game is a serious challenge, just enough to keep you focused and alert. I was already dying a couple times to the first boss but only due to my own lack of agility, as soon as I learned the patterns and was dodging every attack I had it down. You'll need to find every power-up item, utilize every weapon and technique, and apply the highest level of hand-eye coordination in order to surpass these very difficult battles.  This is extremely reminiscent to how the bosses of the golden-era of gaming would beat you just hard enough to keep you coming back for another try with newfound strategies.\n\nSo many of the best ideas are drawn from the original Megaman series, and they work just as well as ever. These are concepts that have withstood the test of time and remain solid after all these years. You'll encounter the electronic Appearing Blocks (also known as Buzzing Blocks) that fade in and out one after another from the iconic Magnetman stage of Megaman 3, the hovering shield bots patrolling back and forth that you can only hit from behind, the classic pixel gates on either side of a boss fight bringing us back to those fateful moments in Wily's castle so many years ago. The level design and platforming elements are really where the game shines, and definitely have received a huge makeover since the late 80's titles that it draws inspiration from giving controls and combat that are much smoother and more precise. Rex Rocket is less stiff feeling and way more action packed than similar legends of the past, making this much more than just a simple homage.\n\nExploration and progression in Rex Rocket is probably the most enjoyable in the metroidvania genre of games I've felt since probably the GBA Castlevanias, with a huge array of rooms to get sidetracked on during your trek to the current objective. Taking detours into the more diabolical of rooms along your way is encouraged and extremely rewarding as well as satisfying as you'll come across plenty of game-changing items that add to your health, lives, overall ammo, and plenty of story tidbits in the form of Info Nodes to find. Defeating the challenging bosses earns you crucial upgrades and new weapons, leading you back through areas you previously thought impossible to traverse providing immensely satisfying exploration of the gigantic map.\n\nAlthough the visuals follow a generally retro flavor the pixel art on the sprites have a detail and complexity to them that far surpasses their past counterparts. The backgrounds in Rex Rocket are amazingly pleasing on the eyes and have a serious level of depth to them with twisting pipes, rotating gears and pulse-emitting motherboards reaching back for multiple layers. The rhythmic movements of the setting around you is complimented perfectly by the outstanding chiptune soundtrack provided by musician Saskrotch which, just like the game, strikes that Megaman style all too well specifically of the 1-3 era.\n\nRex Rocket isn't just a love-letter to the golden-era of games, it's a solid addition to any modern action gamers' library. If you're looking for that next retro-flavored hit of precise and fluid platforming action and metroidvania exploration, Rex Rocket is your perfect combination of the best mechanics from the old and the new.","August 12, 2014","true","24.0"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","2"

This however is just a gamplay feature, it's meant to be hard and it's meant to kill you over and over again until you learn to fight them properly or just get lucky.\nThe game plays like the classic games of the gameboy era, with the simple run and shoot mechanics, paired with things like wall jumping and secondary weapons. Really a treat to play.\nI give this game a solid 9/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging, if nostalgic game.","August 6, 2014","true","3.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blitzkriegsler/recommended/288020/","Blitzkriegsler","Blitz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blitzkriegsler/","807 products in account","Rex Rocket does a very good job of brining the classic 8-bit platformer to tthe modern day. The game's music and artwork bring back a lot of memories of my childhood and playing NES games like Megaman, Even going as far as respawning enemies if you go back to a completed room. The game also has a lot of little fun quirks/Easter eggs that are fun to pick up on and poke fun at other sci-fi works - that would be next to impossible in the 8-bit classics.\n\nI have been playing with my Xbox 360 controller and have about 3 hours into the game now. Controls seem a bit wonky to begin with, but once you get used to them - it works perfectly - although my thumb now hurts from being lazy and using a mouse for the last year.\n\nThe platforming can be quite difficult at times with multiple button combinations, but the game basically has unlimited lives. If you die over and over to the "game over" screen, you can just continue. It does spawn you back some, but everything you collected and did was with you still. You just need to clear the mobs out of the rooms and catch up to where you were.\n\nI did occasionally get lost, the map leaves a little to be desired, but gives you a good indication of direction. I would have liked to see a little dot for where my character is in each room. All in all, it serves it's purpose and isn't "hand-holdy".\n\nI did have some issues with full screen mode, the game would not open after switching to it. I contacted the developers and they are working on a fix and sent me a quick fix that is working.\n\nIf you would like to see my playthrough, you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4D232HeetQPjgdm9hdkZsvllVQw0Xqd5","August 7, 2014","true","14.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

It is screen-punchingly hard, but also extremely compelling, and you'll be trying "one more time" over and over.\n\nOne bad part is the lives counter (20 lives). It's always pretty easy to get back to where you were so the consequence for losing all 20 lives is pretty minimal, but it doesn't add anything to the game other than frustration.\n\nThe game is too frugal with it's teleporters, so you'll traverse a long way to a boss, only to get killed (it takes a while to learn their patterns) and then you'll need to work your way back. I recommend going to your Users/[your username here]/AppData/Local/Rex Rocket/ and creating copies of the save files just after you've gotten to the Boss area. This way you'll be able to reload just before the bosses. And trust me..you'll need to.\n\nI strongly recommend using a controller as others have suggested. I also strongly recommend going to the game options to change directional control from the analog stick to the D-pad.","August 5, 2014","true","22.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

It has great game mechanics such as shooting below you to boost jumps and teleportation, and is slightly less edicting than cocane, however like the games it has fuse together, it is very difficult. When you first start, you will probably die quite a bit, but once you get used to the game, it gets signifigantly easier. The boss fights are set up so that you will have to play them a few times to beat them, also, this is NOT a game for minimalists. If you don't explore for health, lives, and upgrades, the game gets really hard really fast. Furthermore, you should probably play this on a controller, as the keyboard controls are a bit clunky.\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it is well worth $10, and if you ever see it on sale, you would be an idiot to not buy this game.","August 6, 2014","true","2.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/recommended/288020/","shoggofu","YouTube shoggofu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shoggofu/","257 products in account","I was looking forward to playing this game. After 2 hours of game-time I had progressed 13% through the game.\n- fun game\n- but WAAAY harder than I expected\n\nhttp://youtu.be/ToPAMc1uBwY\nhttp://youtu.be/3rKicf2yglo\nSo the first 15-20 minutes was pretty easy because there wasn't really much combat. However once I got to the first boss I started to die a LOT. You start with a lot of lives, I think that is reason. In the options menu you are supposed to be able toggle 'fun mode' on and off. I think that might have actually meant hardcore mode, but this feature seemed to be broken as as there was no apply setting button and it was always back on when I returned to the menu if I'd toggled it off. The boss spammed out a lot of projectiles which I found really tricky to avoid. I think I died at least 15-20 times trying to beat it. The environment is populated by a large amount of enemies. Sometimes it's difficult to get past them with without taking damage i.e. sometimes you don't have much choice but to jump into them. They tend to surround you and appear unexpectedly when you are distracted by other hazards. Also enemies appear to have some degree of random generation so you don't always encounter the same enemies in the same place. I think that probably help keep the same areas fresh.\n\nYou don't re-spawn in the immediate vicinity are after dying instead you are taken back to a checkpoint, which there aren't that many of. This tends to set you back pretty far. So I found that I had to begin the same gauntlets from the start again and again. Sometimes after dying over and over before finally making it through sections I discovered that I'd just went to all the effort only to take me back somewhere that I had already been to! So make sure you check the map system so that you're not just taking alternative routes backwards. Also there are hidden passages and destroyable blocks which will uncover shortcuts that dramatically reduce the effort needed to navigate the ship, so be on the lookout for them. I wish I'd realized these things earlier.\n\nI liked how the game looked. The aesthetics and sound effects remind me of lot of old console and PC games and brought back happy memories. For example I hadn't thought about ID's Dangerous Dave for a long time before playing this. That game was awesome! NPCs in Rex Rocket have little bit's of dialogue, some of which I found amusing.\n\nSo in the time that I played I felt that I only progressed a relatively small amount through the game. It was very difficult and I was having to make numerous attempts to complete small sections of the game. I struggled to reach points only to die at them and have to go back. This has potential for frustration (I’ll admit I did gripe about it lol) but surprisingly I still found that I enjoyed playing this game.\n\nClick here for my YouTube gaming channel","August 5, 2014","true","5.5"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Giant hitbox? check. Slippery jump controls? check. Randomized enemy placement? check, Enemy design guaranteeing you will be hit? check.\n\nSure, it may sound like I'm complaining, and maybe I am, I can beat all the Contras with a little practice, No 30 life code needed. I can beat Super Cyborg without dying. I've played all the traditional Mega-Mans.  And I don't mind getting whupped on in those. But this? Not fun.\n\nMy advice to the devs: Do away with the random element, shrink your characters hitbox, tighten up the slipperyness, especially with the air controls, and really tweak some of the enemies.  The skeletons: do they REALLY need to throw a bone EVERY time you go parallel with them? If you are wall jumping up a corridor and there is a skeleton up at the top of the platform, you are getting hit 90% of the time. Fix the map system.\n\nThe most crucial thing you can do here is fiddle around until you can find that spark that makes it fun. Right now that is lacking.\n\nI do like the pixel art and the concept.

Well, if you answered "yes", then you'll find something to love in Castle Pixel's Rex Rocket...\n\nRex Rocket is a 2D side scrolling action platformer that takes some of the best mechanics from Mega Man, Metroid and other classics, to create a unique and challenging experience. Challenging might not be the best word, though as the game will no doubt crush your soul into oblivion. Yea, it's an amazing challenge that will not hold your hand, and that's one of the best things about the game.\n\nSet in the future, you play as your choice of Rexford or Rexanna Rocket (points for gender equality, Castle Pixel) aboard the Starship called the S.S. Montana. The Council of Science is studying a life form called the Tera-Oozlings and want to essentially abandon them on a distant planet on the other side of the galaxy. Non surprisingly, something goes wrong and things spiral out of control while Rex is in cryo sleep. Upon waking up, he has to take care of business... old school style!\n\nAs I mentioned before, Rex Rocket borrows heavily from games like Mega Man and Metroid with their run and gun action and item acquisition with exploration respectively. For someone like me who has nothing but pure adoration for games like those, I felt it was a welcome combination that's pulled of with gusto here.\n\nYou start the game with a limted moveset and can't take much damage. As you progress, you'll start to find and earn new items and weapons that will help build Rex into a tour de force. Youhave to really work to get most of these though, and while some are easy to get to, others can be a major challenge (*cough GRENADE LAUNCHER *cough). While you don't have to get them all, some are very helpful when progressing through some of the games harder sections.\n\nMost of the time you'll be running, gunning and jumping. Once you start to acquire new weapons and moves, previously unreachable areas will open up to you and you'll find that there are some more calculating sections in the game that will require some extreme patience to overcome. You'll have to take your time in many of these sections in order to claim your prize.\n\nHonestly, if you can't handle an old school challenge, then this isn't the game for you. It's on of the most challenging games I've played in years. With that said, the sense of accomplishment I got from playing through and defeating many of the games challenging bosses and areas was something I haven't felt in a long time. It's so worth it.\n\nCosmetically, the gameis beautiful. The 8-bit graphic style is adorable, the colors are variedand bright, and the chiptune soundtrack will have you tapping your foot non-stop! Also, the dialogue is not to be missed. Be sure to talk to every single NPC that you come across. Trust me!\n\nOverall, Rex Rocket is oozing with charm (see what I did there?) and should not be missed by anyone looking for a finely tuned and polished challenge.\n\nVideo Review Here: http://youtu.be/iddC9hhwIxg\n\n\n\n","August 18, 2014","true","19.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

So a big part of my review is actually not that big of an issue. However, if you want the achievements, then you will have a big problem.)\n\nIs the game good? Yes.\n\nNow I'm gonna tell you the reason why I hate it, because I'm bitter as hell and it's payback time.\n\nRemember that episode of AVGN where he said "The game needs an expert setting. So they programmed it, but forgot to put it in the menus." That applies here. Severely.\n\nThe game is fantastically solid with a good story, power ups to find, great music, crisp graphics, and FOR THE MOST PART a healthy challenge. The problem is that the game has these extreme spikes in difficulty that can bring your fun and enjoyable experience to a screeching halt, leaving you cursing and screaming at the game for making you feel like a punk b**ch.\n\nThe SlimeMech boss was my first brick wall. The fight is bullet hell levels of difficult and it took me quite some time to overcome it. The second brick wall came shortly after, when I reached what I believe are double jump boots behind a locked door. My mood upon discovering these boots was ecstatic. My mood after going through over 100 lives trying to get to them was irritated and upset. You have to traverse a gauntlet that spans multiple screens without a checkpoint in between to reach the boots. The first time I reached the third screen and saw that there was no checkpoint (after half an hour of trying), I couldn't believe it. And when I died (naturally), I turned the game off and started the review.\n\nYou think this is reasonable difficulty and that I'm just b**ching and moaning? Let me describe it for you. You have to go down a pit with spikes on the walls using platforms that damage and kick you off if you don't shoot them first, avoiding turrets that fire spread shots and mines that explode if you touch or shoot them, ending with a tricky jump that has to be made at the bottom or else you fall in acid and die.\n\nNext room, you have to jump across pits of acid onto platforms that disappear 2 seconds after jumping on them with Super Mario Bros. fire sticks spinning on them that knock you back into the acid if they hit you.\n\n\nOkay. Okay. I'm done ranting. To finish off, Rex Rocket is without a doubt a hidden gem and criminally underlooked game on Steam. I love it for being so good, but I hate it for halting my experience with these unreasonably difficult portions. It's worth a purchase as long as you're prepared for a challenge.\n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I still need to get those damn shoes.","February 25, 2015","true","7.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

The game is hard, but very fair.

A fan of hard platformers (Bionic Commando, Castlevania, Contra, Mega Man, Super Meat Boy), I believed it to be a good idea to go ahead and make the purchase.\nI've played it for a little less than an hour. The platforming is slippery, the enemies are either overpowered or in such large numbers as to be overwhelming, the jumping is floaty. Nothing that hasn't been written before. However...\n\nAll of those games I had listed before shared the same difficulty curve as Rex Rocket. The only difference being, if I had died and lost a life in those other games, it was my fault. Playing the game over and over again lead to developing the techniques needed to beat the game. Platform technique memorization in a game like the first Castlevania was not only encouraged, but absolutely necessary. Point being, if you lost a life, it was your fault. Hard, but not unfair, and this type of development, getting into the game's world and learning the facets of it, is why I love the genre.\nThis game isn't like that. Within this last hour, I found myself struggling to avoid screaming ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at my monitor. Traps, spike pits, acid pools, repeated dialogue during boss fights, and randomly-placed enemies with no indications as to where they will appear do not good game design make.\nThe difficulty, when coupled with the controls and enemy placement (as well as other mechanics)  are completely crippling to the fun factor of this game, making it feel like a chore to play. Instead of continuing after I lose a life, I just feel like quitting. Woe betide those who buy this game, expecting a return to retreux-styled glory, for you will only be met with disappointment.","January 8","false","86.0"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","25","42","2","2"

It looks absolutely beautiful, the music is great, and I have had fun playing it. It does remind me a lot of the older metroid games, a very good thing. Sidescrolling metroid was the best. I will definitely be going back to finish this game if it kills my fingers. Certainly worth the money if you love platforms or happen to be a masochist. Then there's the "but..." part.\n\nThe most irritating issue I have is that of the 2 and half hours I have played so far, I have spent maybe a thrid of it waiting. Waiting for a platform to move back towards me, waiting for a block that fades in, and then back out. Maybe waiting on a moving platform for the platform and the fading block to match up. That gets agonizing. In addition to that, I activated 2 of the "warp points" in the first 30, maybe 45 minutes. After that, nothing. If I get a game over, I have to run from that second warp points to where I died. More time that I'm spending jumping jumps that I've not only already done, but that I've already done 10, 15 times. Often, I fail these jumps, not even reaching the end. Shooting the same enemies in the same patterns. Did I mention there were enemies? They're not really important. You do have health, but I have found that even if I do take a few hits, it's either missing a jump, or getting my jump interupted by an enemy or an attack, and subsequently falling into green insta-killing goo, that kills me. Bosses aside, I can't think of one time where an enemy killed me with an attack, leaving the enemies to fade into the background. I noticed myself even writing them off unless they were between me and a jump. I wasn't afraid of them. They were no threat. If you're gonna give me HP, I'd prefer if it worked either as a LoZ type thing where falling takes some of it away, moving me back to, say, the room entrance, or more of a mario-esque style where any enemy attack kills me and there's no HP at all. The way it is, falling is such an extreme danger compared to the enemies that they are overshadowed.\n\nAnother quick thing to mention is the energy bit things. The game explains quite nicely that if you collect 100 of them, you get an extra life, and that large containers of 100 can also be found. This led me to believe that the little bits would be scattered about, dropped by enemies, etc. The complete opposite ended up being true. Occasionally I would see an enemy drop one or two, but they always end up in the goo where I couldn't get to it. Some rooms would have 5 or 6 floating over platforms, but that was the exception, not the rule. I found that the containers were treated like collectibles, or upgrades, stashed away in spots where I would likely lose a life just getting there or back, and so I wrote them off too. It was too much risk for the reward. Once again, a large part of the game was lost, consumed by the platforming, draining away the cool things that are amazing to prioritize something frustrating and constant.\n\nThe bosses were tons of fun. Hard as all ♥♥♥♥, but fun. A decent reward for completing all the platforming leading up to them, and, at least in the two that I've fought already, I never felt like I couldn't win that time, or dodge that attack, which is a good thing.\n\nI'll probably update this as I go further in the game, maybe some of these things get better. Or I'm an idiot and missing something. Right now, though?\n\nSolid 8/10","August 9, 2014","true","2.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The game transcends being "just another retro platformer" though with solid controls, clever level design, and plenty of charm.\n\nPlaying the game is most easily comparable to controlling a more agile Mega Man. You platform. You shoot. Your protagonist is pretty fragile. This all takes place in a sizable, continuous world — some would say Metroidvania, but those aspects are relatively light (there are plenty of health upgrades tucked into corners, in any case). When you defeat bosses, you'll be rewarded with new weapons and tools.\n\nBeing an excellent game, you will be challenged to master most of these tools. By the end, you will be zipping around the world in a fashion very unlike how you started the game, as much due to your own improving skill as to the gadgets you've acquired.\n\nRex Rocket is well-paced and, thankfully, tightly scoped as well. It's not a short game, but you won't be grinding or, for the most part, repeatedly playing through the same encounters either.\n\nI do have one great qualification though: this game is tough. There are optional areas that you will likely never be able to complete, but there are also sections within the critical path of the game that match Super Meat Boy in difficulty. It is demanding, and you should be forewarned.","October 5, 2014","true","13.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

For me this game came out of nowhere, I just happened to see it as a new release on steam and was instantly drawn in by the trailer.  After playing through the game I can say that the game certainly is as awesome as the trailer makes it look, it was also much more challenging than the trailer made it look.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and almost all tracks in the game are memorable. It's good enough that I'd pay extra money if the mp3's were offered as DLC.\n\nThe pixel art  is very well done has a retro feel, while also providing a high amount of detail in the backgrounds, Particle effects, and animation.\n\nThe boss fights are megaman style, most are very challenging to beat the first time you fight them, but become easy to defeat after you learn thier patterns. Also again like megaman you get a weapon or skill after defeating each boss which makes defeating them feel more rewarding.\n\nThe level design is great, and the game consistently offers challenging platforming that makes you uses all abilities at your dispoal to get through, my favorite being shooting a charge shot straight down to use as a makeshift double jump. The controls are spot on, most deaths are the result of your own mistakes (or really enemies that are being really mean). The ship is also full of secret collectibles to hunt down, be they behind hidden walls or in hard to reach places, it demands a lot of exploration to find all of them.\n\n\nI reccomend this game to anyone looking for a challenging retro style Metroid-like, I've never seen the concept done as well as this in an indie game. Make sure you are prepared for a challenge before buying the game though, as you will likely die many times before completing it.","August 11, 2014","true","18.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

They're about learning, generally; you'll die pretty quickly the first time, the second time you'll survive longer, and by the third or fourth time you kind of know what you're doing, but it takes several more attempts to actually pull it off. The final boss, especially, is really tense but really fun, with a lot of attacks and a changing arena gimmick to keep things interesting. But all the bosses are very different and well-designed.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are pretty sweet, too. The bullet-hopping allows for some inventive platforming before you get the double jump, and combining both types of jumps becomes second-nature eventually. The optional dash boots add a bit of a safety net to things and are pretty darn fun to use, and the teleport mechanic introduced late in the game provides a few extra puzzly mechanics on its own. There are a decent amount of puzzles even without the teleporter, though, but the focus is on the platforming and the enemies. The enemies are generally okay, there's a few I don't like (helper bots can rot in hell) and sometimes they're overly spammy in placing them, but on the whole, alright. Not a fan of when they get in the way of the platforming, though.\n\nThere's also a ton of stuff to find. 40 health powerups, 40 ammo powerups, 7 grenade powerups, 90 nodes (maybe? nobody's found them all), 18 records, and 3 books, aside from a ton of extra lives scattered around the map. And there's two platforming gauntlets to get the optional dash boots and grenade launcher. The first challenge section is presented to you before you really want to go for it (it's stupidly hard without the double jump, which you can't have when you come upon it) but the section is pretty satisfying when you do have the double jump. Less satisfying is the path for the grenade launcher, which has an overly long and tedious room in the middle that involves, of course, helper bots. The first and last room are both fine, though I don't like challenge based on length rather than pure skill, but ehh, it's mostly the awful middle room. Aside from that room and a few questionable rooms later on in the game though it's generally well-designed and satisfying to play.\n\nI just think this game is, all-around, pretty dang good. For the price it's a decent length, it's pretty replayable, it's challenge but rarely unfair, and just an enjoyable experience.","September 4, 2015","true","12.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The monsters aren't hard to beat, but if you're not paying attention they will kill you.  The levels are set up to reward thinking things through instead of blindly jumping in.  The bosses have patterns that will kill you if you don't learn how to avoid their attacks.  All of these things are good.  The reward skill rather than just luck or blindly firing.\n\nHowever, Rex Rocket also has platforming areas where virtually every single inch of the area is a death trap for you.  Acid covers the floor and if you touch it even once, you're dead and have to start back over.  Spikes might be waiting below, instant death.  Monsters will be on the ceiling, floor, and air, all waiting to touch you just once so they can knock you into whatever death waits below, and they dont have specific paths they follow, leaving you to the fate of their randomly generated movements.  Gun turrets or lasers will be positioned to fire on you and directly into your path, one touch and it's hello instant death below.  Trap boxes are placed as your only stepping stone.  Once you step on them, monsters pop out.  Mines floating in the area are positioned in areas you need to traverse over by shooting downward to float over areas.  If you hit one, they explode, sending off energy shots into your flight path.  Add on to all of this that the controls are not as precise as they should be for such a platformer.  it's very easy to feel like you've overshot your landing on a platform, attempt to correct your path just ever so slightly, and be sent off the edge of the platform because the movement is so touchy in the air, or to simply think you're going to land just slightly on the edge of the platform, safe, only to find that you fall short, and then fall to your death.\n\nRex Rocket is fun, but those death trap platforming areas are not.  If you use a continue, you start off with twenty (20) lives.  Not only do you have to fight your way back through several other areas, which is not only tedious and time consuming, and you're liable to lose a life or three in the process, but then you have to go back through these platforming areas sometimes even if you already completed them once before.  I've gone through three of these platforming areas so far.  Each time I've lost all of my lives.  Sometimes I had well over 20 lives because I had found extra lives before.  A few of those lives were my fault, because instead of taking the way I knew would get me safely to the next spot, I decided to experiment and try a new way.  However, the very large majority of the time it was due to a gun turret, a small slime, a land mine placed directly in my path, a slime bat, a slime on the ceiling, or, my personal favorite, a very wide open area with extremely limited space to stand on with mines between those spaces and those spaces are actually slime box traps and it seems like those safe spaces aren't even properly spaced for you to be able to make it completely without putting yourself at extreme risk of death.\n\nRex Rocket tries to be a game like classic mega man.  The difference is, classic mega man games were hard, but fair and reasonable.  You only died if you screwed up.  Rex rocket kills you many times when it's not your screw up.\n\nI do not recommend this game until these areas are reworked.","August 8, 2014","false","3.4"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","24","46","0","6"

It is easily one of my favorite of this current generation if not all time. The controls are smooth and responsive and the game mechanics are fun. The game feel is a good combination of Mega Man and Super Meat Boy. The game is challenging but not overly so. It has a very fair check point system. It also implements the classic system of losing a life every time you die.\n\nRex Rocket is a Metroidvania game. I never got lost though like in some of those style of games. This is in part due to having a simple map system. As stated previously the game is hard but not aggresively so, however I would be more hesitant recommend it for novices to the platformer genre. Any one who has beaten Mega Man 2, Super Meat Boy, or Cave Story would do very well at this game though.\n\nI feel like Metroidvania games are kind of becoming a dime a dozen. I feel that most try to be so aggressively challenging they aren't really worth playing. Rex Rocket maintained being fun while also having lots of tense and challenging segments. Additionally the game feel is just impecable, even if it is pretty much stealing it from Cave Story, which isn't a bad thing at all. So yes if you liked Cave Story's gameplay pick this up. The story isn't as compelling as that game, but the game still rocks!","September 6, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Throughout the game, you'll be moving throughout your very large ship which, in typical Metroidvania fashion, happens to be filled with lots of hidden passages and alternate pathways to your destination, all of which will reward you with power-ups, lore, or records (Collectables that let you listen to certain tracks of the game's soundtrack).\nThe bosses in this game are all challenging and very pattern-based, requiring the player to learn the patterns of the boss, and how to best deal with them if they want to survive. The bosses get faster as their HP gets lower, however, so you'll still need to be careful, even after you've learned their patterns.\nThe general combat of Rex Rocket is still very entertaining in its own right. It mainly features you plowing through waves of enemies easily with your various weapons and grenades, but the large amount of damage the enemies can deal if they hit, and the multitude of instant death traps, helps to keep things nice and dangerous while still keeping you feeling powerful.\nThe platforming elements are your typical "hold the jump button to jump higher” and wall jumping, but also features using your weapon as a source of upward thrust. The game makes heavy usage of these elements, both together, and on their own. These elements are implemented very well with the game having plenty of rooms with tricky platforming segments, both for items, and progression.\nOverall, I can recommend this game to anyone interested in it. The large amount of optional areas and pathways will keep you exploring, the boss fights are fast paced and very satisfying, and the combat, platforming, and exploration elements meld well together. If you dislike precision platformers, there are a few select rooms you’ll have to suffer through, but the overall game is well worth it!\n","August 20, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of my favorite things about the game is the way you can see your skill improving; once-deadly rooms become trivial as you master the moves and enemy patterns. (Rest assured there are completely new and absurd challenges just ahead.) There's a real sense of reward, too, in finally beating an area or hitting a clutch checkpoint, which is something you just don't get with an easier, simpler game. Several times I've put the controller down and given up for the day, at a loss . . . then picked it back up in an hour with a fresh strategy that worked.\n\nIf you relish a bit of challenge, this is completely worth the $10 asking price.","August 21, 2014","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I definitely felt defeated when I first attempted the final boss, but came back two days later and BAM, done on the first attempt.  It's a Retro Shooter-Platformer done excellently.","January 15, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It reminds me of Super Metroid and the old Megaman and games from the awesome platforming to the incredible music. This game is not for the casual gamer, as the difficulty will make you rage at times. In saying that, however, I'm not saying you shuldn't play it, it's very enjoyable. One thing the creators did great on is making you feel accomplished, as when you finally get past that one hard level or beat that impossible boss you been stuck on, you feel like you're on top of the world. Finally, there's the humor. I think the writers did a great job at telling the story and they made me chuckle at times. Everything from the obscure to the pop-culture references were well placed, even if they did make me groan at times. Anyone who likes retro platformers needs to check this game out.

The sprites and backgrounds really pop and there are some interesting lighting effects done with Rex and other sprites. The music is perfect and takes me back to Saturday morning eating a huge bowl of cereal, trying to beat one of my numerous SNES games. The story is simplistic. You play Rex Rocket, some well known bad ♥♥♥ who is assisting a science vessel with transporting an experiment across the galaxy. Chaos ensues, and it is up to you to save the vessel and the day.\n\nThe developers made some odd design choices in the game. You get wall jumping right off the bat, but double jumping is awkward. Instead of giving you a double-jump that you deploy by simply jumping again while airborne, you’re forced to shoot you charged cannon shot (akin to Megaman) downward while airborne to get a second jump. This is cumbersome for many reasons. You cannot fire your weapon before doing the jump-shot, which means you are vulnerable during the first jump. The game takes full advantage of this in some dickish moves during the platforming portions.\n\nThe difficulty of bosses are a major frustrating piece of gameplay.  Outside of a few incredibly difficult pixel-perfect accuracy jumps, the platforming bits between bosses and story elements isn’t difficult. It’s the bosses that wreck my world. The difficulty curve for the bosses is stupid. The first one is easy, the next few are a decent challenge, but the ones toward the middle of the game are a hot mess of difficulty. Their patterns aren't terrible to recognize, but you need pixel-perfect timing with jumps and placement of your character in order to even remotely come close to beating them.  Hard for the sake of being hard is not good game design.\n\nIn addition to frustrating difficulty spikes, the game suffers from an identity crisis. As I mentioned earlier this game pulls inspiration from many other games, which isn’t a bad thing but it doesn’t make any of those inspirations their own. Guacamelee took inspiration from Metroidvania games and beat-em-ups such as “Streets of Rage” and created rich environments and gameplay elements that define the game. Cave Story did the same by taking elements from Metroidvania games as well as a bit from run-and-gun games like “Gunstar Heroes” and build awesome gameplay elements that defined it. This game takes all that inspiration and becomes a game that reminds me how good the original source material was, and how much I want to replay those games.\n\nOverall this game is a mixed bag of good and bad and it all equates to being meh. The artwork is fantastic and the core gameplay elements it draws inspiration on are good, but stupid difficulty spikes, an iffy double-jump mechanic, and a lack of identity bring this game down.\n\nSee more of the review at: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/rex-rocket","October 7, 2014","false","1.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

Others praise the fact that it is a Metroidvania, despite the fact it is as linear as Metroid Fusion, which I did enjoy due to the bosses, story, and atmosphere. The bosses in this game, however, are poorly designed due to flaws such as unskippable intro cutscenes, often poorly telegraphed attacks in combination with slight randomization, and sometimes attacks that can be undodgeable in some situations no matter what the player does. The story is not something to be taken seriously, which I can understand, but the back story provided through the Info Codexes can actually mislead the player on enemies by claiming they're invincible to most weaponry when they in fact are not. That particular codex was also placed before a boss, which was immediately followed by a room with moving platforms and at least a dozen of the supposedly invincible enemy flying around in ways that could make them incredibly difficult to dodge, which would often lead to the player being knocked into the instant death spikes which do not respect invincibility frames. This was incredibly pleasant due to the fact that the player can run out of lives at this point, and if they do they have to go all the back to the boss they just killed, and then continue on yet another long path. This life system is incredibly good considering the fact that difficulty is excessive in this game, often matching poorly designed fangames of I Wanna Be The Guy, and if you've played one of those, you'd know they should not be retail games. And yet here we are with a Metroidvania with a life counter, difficulty that is incredibly high for a game with a life counter and very few points you can continue from, and music that I can't listen to for extended periods of time without turning off to listen to something more appealing, such as nails on a chalkboard.\nIn summation, don't listen to the hype of yet another poorly made, ugly "8-bit" (which actually aren't 8-bit at all, just a realatively easy art style that's cheap and in vogue currently due to the nostalgia train), and save your money for something more enjoyable, like an actual ♥♥♥♥ing Metroidvania game.","August 30, 2014","false","8.5"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","8","19","0","0"

The graphics are smooth and nicely done, the plot is surprisingly interesting, the music is above average if nothing particularly memorable, the exploration is decent, and the controls are responsive if a bit intentionally cumbersome.\n\nSaid controls are where the issues start creeping in. You use your gun for pretty much everything from spraying enemies, to boosting your jump or slowing your descent, to hitting switches, to fighting bosses in which you frequently have to juggle most of the above. It just gets a bit much to manage, switching between using your shots for maneuverability and offense mid-jump while attempting to traverse countless instant-death slime and spike pits in rooms teeming with enemies that will usually end up knocking you off a ledge, and then all respawn when you do.\n\nMy enjoyment ground to a halt somewhere around I'm guessing halfway through when I lost no fewer than 20 lives to a boss whose main attack I could not reliably dodge thanks to the slight bit of midair inertia that makes precision projectile evading more challenging than it should be, and once I did finally survive that fight by the skin of my teeth I died another 6 times immediately in the following room. The difficulty just escalates far too quickly from sane to hard to very hard to masochistic, and the antiquated lives system is always looming overhead threatening to erase a large chunk of your progress.\n\nIn short, I liked it, but it just got too damn frustrating.","November 26, 2015","false","2.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

I've played this game for a reasonable amount of time. I know how to play platformers quite well, I've played and grown up with them; playing everything from Mega Man to Mario (the games this one claims to aspire to live up to) and I have to tell you, this game is not good. The game's bosses are either LUDICROUSLY over powered, or just blatantly unfair. Not to mention that they are extremely bland! Take the game's fourth boss, (mini-boss?) for example; he moves from left-to-right, while spamming projectiles that seem to take no path which can be learnt, or avoided, and do more damage than is necessary. When he is on the left side of the screen, you can not go behind him. When on the right side of the screen, however, he is able to be jumped behind so that you can do damage to him without him targeting you. Every blue moon he decides he should address the threat behind him, so he just fires projectiles into the wall in an attempt to hit you, with very little tell that he will do so. Not to mention the fact that your weapons do almost NO damage to any boss-type enemy in the game. You literally have to hit the boss so much that I got BORED fighting him. A platforming game, in which there are boss-fights, caused me to become bored at it's main mechanics. I love mega-man, but this game? Nah. This game isn't worthy of that title. The worst part? The game could have been good! If it was just beta-tested by someone, even if someone played through the first hour of the GAME to address that the charge-shot did almost NOTHING to the bosses in the game, or even the damn REGULAR ENEMIES, for that matter; they would have realized that the games balancing was almost non-existent! The grenades don't actually explode, rather than creating a point at which 7 projectiles come from that do regular damage, the charge-shot is worthless EXCEPT TO SERVE AS YOUR DOUBLE JUMP. Yes, you don't get a double jump. You get a gimped charge-shot that only serves to be a horribly-implemented double jump, there is a bullet-hover mechanic similar to Cave Story's, but doesn't work as well, and you get a secondary weapon system, in which you have limited, but RECOVERING ammo, which you have to get ammo upgrades for that sometimes don't even give you a full ammo for some of said weapons. There is just a myriad of horribly implemented mechanics in the game that preventing it from being what it COULD BE! It could be enjoyable, but with this many issues left un-addressed? No. This game was just a waste of $10, and I'm not one to cry over buying indie games for larger sums of cash.","August 6, 2014","false","3.6"," 17 of 46 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","17","46","0","1"

If you are a fan of pain in the ♥♥♥♥ platformers (super meat boy), castlevania/metroid (metroidvania) games, collectible games, 8-bit, and awesome bosses - BUY THIS GAME!\n\nI hadn't heard of this game and picked it up on sale as a fluke.  I was not disappointed in the least.  It's a fun game that hearkens back to the NES era and the boss battles are by far the best part of the game.  While a little short (I beat it in under 7 hours, not 100%), it will still have you entrapped by the wonderful artwork, the music, and the atmosphere.\n\nI hope to see more from this series in the future!  They have my full support.","May 20, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have continued like thousands of times now. Items like the shoes or the grenade launcher are still WAY too hard to get. Axiom Verge, baby time in the sandbox. Hyperlight Drifter ... preschool. Dark Souls ... freeking kindergarden. F1 racing while juggling chainsaws on the sun while disarming a bomb, Still a joke compared to this game. Saying this game is Brutal is dumb... they have no word to describe how painfully terrible the difficulty is. I wanna be the boshy (you gonna get ***** mode) ... is maybe the only thing harder ive ever seen. And the guys who did that game are straight up sick in the head. :) ... I am enjoying the game however. I wish I could get the boots and Launcher. but I suspect ill get to the last boss and quit like 90% of the people ive seen on the forums here. But I do enjoy a good Metroidvania, and there really are SO few good ones out there. This one is fun for the most part. You probably will enjoy it too, after a while It will probably wear on you, but by then if you havent rage quit, you will probably stick it out.","April 27","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And if a game was created to make me feel again at 8-bit age, why it make me play with anolog stick?\n3) Don´t shot in diagonal: with d-pad you have 8 directions and with analog stick you have much more, why limit the shot to 4 directions. It´s very annoying try to shot enemies above you.","April 23","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty is very high here, but I don't think it's unreasonably so; there is a chase sequence near the middle of the game which I felt demanded memorization and the handful of 'behind-the-scenes' rooms filled with slimes have so many enemies that it seems impossible to get through them without taking damage, but the rest of the game felt entirely reasonable (other than two completely optional and extremely difficult segments which each lead to powerful upgrades which are not needed to complete the game) and often encourages you to use your grenades and subweapons in different ways. There's also plenty of variety to the platforming, tons of collectibles, and extremely little mandatory backtracking, so the gameplay never feels stale. If you're looking for a game with a high amount of exploration you might be disappointed though; the main path through each region is generally straightforward and the next goal is always clearly marked on the map.\n\nI also want to address two common complaints I see in many of the negative reviews. First, several of the older reviews complain about the lives system and how you lose a substantial amount of progress if you run out of lives; this is a completely valid complaint, but this system was changed near the end of 2014 and now lives and the coin-like energon pieces are as arbitrary as lives and coins in a Mario game with no particular penalty for getting a Game Over other than missing out on an achievement. Secondly, I see a surprising number of reviews complaining about slipper platforming, but I honestly never found this to be an issue; the jump *is* slippery, but shooting downward with non-charged shots significantly reduces your momentum and allows for a good amount of precision. I'm not sure if some of the people who had issues with the controls were only trying to navigate in the air with the vertical-boosting charge shots or if they had trouble pressing the button quickly enough to benefit from the normal shots (or it's entirely possible that the controls were adjusted in a patch at some point), but as of April 2016 I was able to play through this game in its entirety with a PS3 controller without noticing any control issues.","April 29","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
