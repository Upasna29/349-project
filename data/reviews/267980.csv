I was hooked unfortunetly for me at the time I had no method of obtaining it.\n\nBasically you control a carrier ship which is 1 of two left in the Antaeue Project with the second being out of commison which has the ability to construct certain vehicles Land/air which will expand in variety as you play the game. The pilots for your vehicles are actually the soul of someone who died piloting one of the vehicles you harvest that have been recorded into a soulchip.\n\nConstruction happens because of the creation engine which is full of tiny nanites that can build things really fast due to sheer number of them however without energy you will not be able to make things.\n\nYou will need to collect energy via harvesting metallic objects that are littered throughout the levels.\nTo upgrade units/unlock tech you will need to fight and analyse vehicles/weapons.\n\nFrom what I can tell thus far this is original untouched code that still play's well. The Resolution is still pretty low but don't let that put you off.\n\nThis is a strategy game that is in dire need for a HD remake or a sequel.\n\nI am now a happy owner with 3 copies. 1 from amazon, 1 from gog and now thanks to steam I now have it in my steam library.\n\nSo what are you waiting for Captain? Buy it and play it.\n\nLast time i checked this game is missing the 1.3 patch which is really needed.\nThis game is old so don't expect widescreen support.","January 30, 2014","true","1.1"," 165 of 183 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","165","183","3","9"

A maximum of 10 units (usually 6-7 being used) active at once, along with the strategic view always pausing the game, makes it a much more enjoyable experience for those hating micromanagement (like me). The story is fantastic, it could very well come from an A-rated movie. The characters here have a soul and their constant banter makes you feel as if you weren't playing alone. It truly gives you the feeling of being a captain who is in constant touch with his soldiers over a commlink.\n\nThe game strongly hints at a sequel, but nothing's come up so far. It has potential, pick it up Valve ;).","August 6, 2014","true","18.2"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","51","53","0","0"

It is a unique game that manages to combine strategy with blowing chunks of metal out of people. It's possible to manually control everything, manually gather resources (like a strategy game), manually shoot at people who would shoot at you (like a dumb tank shooter). Alternatively, you could leave it to the AI and plan your attacks out, just like a strategy game.\n\nThis game therefore turns the strategy genre on its head, allowing you to have more direct control over your units. You can have the AI do all the boring stuff, taking land vehicles from the carrier deck to the actual land and then go looking for resources, while you take control of the aircraft taking people out.\n\nAs the game goes on, you get cool upgrades, new weapons, armour, different units, all kinds of stuff. You get more AI characters to control your ever growing army, and you'll end up with some intense battles against the hordes of... well, hell if I know. The story is a bit weird. The gameplay is where it's at.\n\nI haven't played a game like this. It's a shame really, this game is really innovative and I would have enjoyed a sequel. Unfortunately, the developers went out of business. Kind of a shame, they started off in my birthplace.\n\nYou won't regret buying this game if you like explosions or strategy. Oh, a small bonus since you read this far: hold down the right mouse button when you are in the Antaeus construction room and move your mouse. Ahh, I love random attention to detail!","January 31, 2014","true","2.3"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","49","52","0","0"

I thank my dad for buying me this game. The game was well presented. The story was very powerful, and the narrator had you at the edge of your seat. As for graphics, they will obviously be ugly compared to those of more modern games, but, hey, this game was made in 2001, so give it a break. It was great at the time. Now for the gameplay. What a wonderful combination of real-time strategy and third-person shooter elements! Yes, it has the action, but you really need think, and start being strategic. And I love the resource management. The sound and music were excellent as well. What pains me is that there was no multiplayer. If it had multiplayer, then it would be a great game perfected. Unfortunately, the game only has a story mode, so once you beat the game, that's it. But it takes about 20-30 hours to complete, and a second playthrough is worth it, so that's like 40-60 hours. In conclusion, this is the best game nobody plays. I hope one day, someone will remake this game, solve all its issues and I'll buy it on day one.","November 6, 2014","true","9.5"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","2"

Despite having this beauty on what we old timers refer to as a 'CD', (look it up kids!), I could not resist picking it up right away.\n\nAny game that puts you in direct control of a nicely varied selection of modular vehicles then sets you free to cause mayhem and destruction throughout a well written & voiced campaign mode is worth a look. Steadily escalating your capabilities in a brilliantly paced way that ties directly into the plot throughout will make it well worth your time.\n\nAdding to this tapestry is an ever increasing rosta of varied AI wingmen which all work under and alongside you to their own unique strengths and personalities. Making the very means of their inclusion a major plot point & using them to add some character to the overall campaign is a great touch. An early example of these would be your typical grizzled tank commander who will chew you out if given anything less than an artillery cannon to pound his enemies into dust with.\n\nYes, the characters are often familiar, but very cleverly done as this serves to guide you as to where they would be best suited on the battlefield. When put into their prefered roles, they truly do shine. Showing off some incredible ai for the day, they will carry out their roles with an impressive degree of independance. With their battle chatter and relevant feedback to you and each other adding yet another layer to their realism, they help make your typical mission feel extreemly vibrant and organic.\n\nIf only you could provide the player with an unbelivably intuitive command system for said wingmen, allowing you to issue on-the-fly instructions to these guys & gals.. who would then act on those orders in a contextually sensible way the likes of which are rarely seen even today. Yeah, you can do that. Want that hovertank to guard your resource collecter? 3 buttons. Transport chopper to bring your laser turret to high ground? 3 buttons. Deranged chopper pilot to provide you air support? Well you get the idea. All easilly done whilst blasting enemy factories/dodging missiles/going sightseeing.\n\nNot a fan of sending commands whilst in the thick of it? Relax and enjoy the accessable yet thoroughly satisfying command overview screen where you can issue units waypoints, co-ordinate attacks, set up resource gathering, construction queues, and transport duties etc from the comfort of your very own holo-map thing. THEN get back into the thick of it and blow the absolute hell out of stuff whilst you watch your masterplan unfold around you.\n\nThe sheer ambition behind this game managed to light a fire under me all those years ago, a fire which has been rekindled by simply seeing it on the store front. A genuine classic which I would put up on a pedestal beside the likes of Deus Ex & would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. If for no other reason than to get a good idea of what a game created by true talent and vision can -and should- feel like.\n\nMy only gripe is the lack of options to extend the life of the campaign after that first, (awesome), playthrough. Oh, and I'd absolutly kill for a good multiplayer mode :)\n","February 1, 2014","true","0.8"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","0"

Your journey takes you through a chicane of 20 islands in the South Pacific as you investigate and dismantle the Cabal's operations.\n\nThe storyline, written by famous comicmaker Warren Ellis and narrated by legendary Doctor Who veteran Tom Baker, is very deep and engaging, and makes you genuinely care about both your crew and vessel, and the helpless world you are protecting. I won't give away any spoilers but suffice it to say there are far worse things hiding in those islands than 20-year-old tanks and gunships, and by the end you'll experience quite a few genuinely scary moments.\n\nThe gameplay is, as I said, quite seamless, without a single bug. Steam integration could be better however: the Overlay isn't working so you can't take screenshots and it doesn't log your game time (which is why it says up there that I've played 0 hours of it), and as of yet there is no Steam Cloud support. We can only hope. However, the root game is quite well-rounded and optimized. The AI, especially that of your uploaded soldiers, is competent without making you feel unnecessary; there's always a situation where you're better off taking the wheel yourself. Graphics-wise, quite amazingly, the game looks rather good, especially given how old it is, and it will run without a problem on any machine.\n\nYou have absolutely no reason to deny yourself this amazing game.\n\n100/10 Recommended!","March 12, 2014","true","5.5"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/267980/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Interplay's latest strategy title, Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising, is easy to grade but almost impossible to describe. In a way, it's like an interactive movie in the best sense of the term. Built around an engrossing, well developed plot, Antaeus Rising puts you in command of a scuttled carrier which had been forgotten off the coast of an island in Oceania.\n\nIt's the year 2032 and nano-technology has transformed the world. War has been forgotten and science, industry and healthcare are thriving. Earth is a utopia...until a group of generals and captains of industry (disgruntled because they have nothing to do now) start blowing cities back into nanodust. Sadly, the world's governments are no longer prepared to deal with a large scale war, and are forced to try and rebuild the only remaining nano-carrier on the planet.\n\nThe good news is that since the carrier (dubbed 'Antaeus') uses nano-technology, it can convert almost anything it encounters into building materials to repair itself and build a fleet of tanks and helicopters. In addition, as you discover new technologies you will be able to design increasingly unique units that are tailored to specific kinds of combat. The bad news is that the Antaeus is almost completely crippled, crewless, and under attack when you take command.\n\nFortunately, you don't actually need a crew - you can resurrect the Antaeus' original one. The minds of the Antaeus' best and brightest have been preserved in microchips called "Soulcatchers." Almost any unit that you can design can be equipped with a Soulcatcher unit, and then you can assign one of the resurrected crewmembers to that unit. Creepy, but effective.\n\nIf you match the right crewperson to the right unit, it will pay off in spades. The pilots and tankers assigned to the Antaeus really know their jobs, and they are the best wingmen I have ever had in a PC game. Watching the pilots bob and weave to avoid missile fire or use terrain to sneak up on a target is a real treat.\n\nIn fact, the AI is sufficiently strong that you can play the entire game without taking advantage of one of Antaeus' coolest features: being able to take control of one of your units and get into the thick of battle. This sets Antaeus apart from other RTS games, though it has been tried in past efforts like Uprising. When you move into the 3D view, the graphics are gorgeous and are certainly comparable to what we have come to expect from a first-person shooter. The actual combat is pure arcade action. Shoot them before they shoot you, and remember that there are a lot more of them.\n\nJumping into one of your units also allows you to see the battlefield up close and make command decisions in real time. I use the helicopter solely for this purpose. I'll jump in and select targets for my units and then provide roving cover where needed. The interface for giving orders and marking waypoints is extremely intuitive, and is the same whether you are on the map screen or using the first person view.\n\nThe types of strategy that will work for various missions is almost completely dependent on your play style. If you can secure a large area and process its raw materials, you will be able to crank out new units as fast as the old ones are destroyed. Since the only place you can produce units is the carrier, however, you may not be able to get your units back into the thick of battle very quickly. On the other hand, you can take a covert ops approach and try to surgically accomplish your mission goals with minimal casualties.\n\nSadly, the mission scripting assumes that you cannot figure this sort of thing out for yourself and tends to walk you through the golden path to success in each mission - whether you want it to or not.\n\nOf course, much of the scripting in those missions is intended to further the plot of the game, which is a pleasant change from having the plot exist solely to provide an excuse for the action. Fans of a good story will find that the scripted events, cutscenes and professional voice acting are just as engrossing as the first-person gameplay. In this regard, Antaeus hopefully offers a glimpse of how developers will be looking for new ways to create fun, engrossing experiences that do not fit easily into a particular genre.\n\nWhich Antaeus certainly does not. With only a few units (up to eight) under your control at a time, it's not a typical RTS game. Yet with a hefty strategic element and the requirement that you rely on your team's excellent AI, it's not a first-person shooter.\n\nAntaeus is best taken as what it is: an experience. It is a graphically beautiful, fully engrossing story that lets the player take the role of combatant and commander. If, in this kind of game, you tend to zip through missions only once without playing with different strategies or fully exploring the scenarios or the maps, Antaeus is probably not for you. On the other hand, if the multi-layered change of pace appeals to you, the richness and quality of the limited gameplay make the game well worth the price of admission.","December 12, 2015","true","11.0"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","26","29","3","0"

The story puts you in the middle of a world rebuilt after a war that nearly destroyed everything. The people of this new world once again find themselves in a conflict, this time against the leaders of the old world who escaped into hiding after losing the war.\n\nThe story is pretty good and would make for an interesting reboot with a modern look. As a real-time strategy, it's actually pretty fun. The voice acting is decent and the game looks good for a 2001 release, but definitely outdated by todays standards. The game utilizes a 3D map, which is a nice change for RTS games released around the same time. The controls are different than I expected for an RTS. I usually like to micromanage my units, but with Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising you don't have that ability. There are an array of different units you can create, each with their own abilities and shortcomings, Unlike more popularly known titles such as the Command and Conquer games, in Antaeus Rising you have the ability to individually upgrade units with armor, shields and so on.\n\nAll in all, while it might be a bit dated, it is a decent RTS and is worth picking up if you are into old school Real Time Strategy games. Personally, I would like to see this on a reboot list at some point in the future.","July 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","36","48","0","2"

Back in 2000 I picked up the original boxed copy for a mere £10 when it was brand new, the reason I bought it was because in PC Review they said it was a modern day Carrier Command (my favourite game of all time on the PC - 1988), since Carrier Command I have always wanted another game similar to it and RAGE provided a similar experience in a different mould.\n\nCarrier Command was about you taking a Carrier that can create Mantas (planes) and Walrus' (amphibious tanks), you were to travel from island to island and capture them for resources in order to then track down the enemy carrier and destroy it, you need to be aware though as the enemy carrier can also do the exact same thing as you can. Hostile Waters is very similar in the regard that you travel from island to island in order to prepare for destroying the enemy carrier however unlike Carrier Command you don't have any freedom going in between islands, instead each island is a mission.\n\nIn both Carrier Command and Hostile Waters you have to go on the islands and recover resources, this is where the games similarities move apart, Carrier Command has supplies sent straight to you depending on what you require at any given moment, short of missiles? Order them from a nearby island and it will be shipped straight to you, in Hostile Waters you instead only receive resources by harvesting them from destroyed objects.\n\nWhere Carrier Command is clearly focused on the sea, Hostile Waters makes the island missions superb fun, each island can have bases or something else entirely, having the right preparation in order to carry out your mission is essential and the AI becomes pivotal. Thankfully the AI is brilliantly done, if they're in trouble then they don't just stay there, they'll do what they can to take down the enemy, out maneouvre them and even retreat. The battle chatter makes the missions even better as the AI have conversations between themselves, it makes the feel very real.\n\nUsing the mission map to plot out AI behaviour is a breeze to do and it makes you more of a commander than a pilot so you tend to let the AI do what they like to get things done. If you want to take control of their vehicle then that's possible too.\n\nSome of the latter missions are dearthly and really requires you to plan ahead as you will be turned to sushi, having said that though it's not impossible but once you've completed the game you will have perhaps the biggest smile on your face.\n\nBuy the game, play the game, live the game. If I could give a score out of 10 it would be 11!\n\nIf you haven't played Carrier Command at all then I highly recommend that too.","February 1, 2014","true","1.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

I have bought this game 3 times by now, for one reason or another.  The story is rather unique and the setting you find yourself in is like few others I have ever seen.  The fact that this game came out in the age of giant PC game boxes and has continued to be sold non-stop even up until today is saying something in and of itself.  However, the feel of the game and its re-playability have been key reasons for why I just keep coming back to it.  From the ability to hot-seat from the carrier that houses your brain (which if you try to look around in some of the internal views, you might catch a glimps of) to any one of your combat vehicals, it offers multitudes of ways to experience each of the unique levels.  Even the pilots' AI's are differnt in their appoch to how they handel each type of vehical.  Be it hellicopter, hovercraft, tank, or buggy; as well as what they will do in combat... even their prefered weapons can become something of a deciding factor from one fight to the next depending on the enemies they are facing and who is on their wing.  Compared to most modern feel-alikes, the part that stands out most for me is the ease with which you can command your forces in the field be it from the live interface or the tactical map.  The only down side I could think of is the one mission where stealth is required, where in you fail if your forces are detected before a particular objective is completed.  Thankfully its only one mission and after you finish it, you never need worry about it again.  If any other levels give you trouble, feel free to ask for tips or tricks.

The graphics are dated heavily but they were very advanced for the time and it still isnt painful to look at.

I can't even imagine how blockbuster this must've been in 2001, but it's absolutely "fun".\n\nI hear about problems with pathfinding, and I can't confirm or dispell them, so keep an eye out for that. So far so good.\n\nThere's only "campaign" mode which is unfortunately linear, not particularly many ways to go about "use helicopters, assault base", but it does instance you in various areas and just say "go", not ridiculously handholding past the first few operations.\n\nThe NPC/undead (no more info, spoilers!) solders banter between themselves and it's great! Stellar and unexpected interaction that definitely livened up a sliiightly sterile game.\n\nI actually felt bad when I realized that the foot ground forces were surrendering, after I'd killed quite so many (they never fought at all, but I figured, big bad evil enemy... little bad evil footies) and I think I'll restart and kill none.","December 9, 2014","true","0.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

To this day, I've yet to find a game quite like it.\n\nIt's quite cheesy and the story is a little rediculous at first, but it soon gets interesting once the "real" enemy appears. It actually makes a really good argument for nanotechnology and makes an interesting stab at what that would mean for us all.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a great little strategy game. Its control scheme is awkward when it comes to issuing orders, you have to get used to regularly stopping the action in order to issue new commands and some of the micromanaging of the recycling unit gets bloody tedius at times, but it makes up for it when you just jump in and control a unit yourself.\n\nIt's a shame this version doesn't come with any modern perks like widescreen support, but it works well enough on my Windows 7 x64 machine.","February 8, 2014","true","6.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Morbo513/recommended/267980/","Morbo513","Morbo513","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Morbo513/","119 products in account","One of the most criminally underrated and unknown games out there.\nYou play as the last functional Adaptive Cruiser, the Antaeus - a vessel capable of building combat units from scratch with its on-board Creation Engine - fighting on behalf of the global utopian society that had abolished war. Your advesaries are the Cabal, the "old guard" of tyrants that had once ruled the world, and seek to do so again.\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting, the characters... have character. They'll chat to one another during the missions, complain if you put them in their least favourite type of vehicle, each have lines for calling out specific enemy units, reporting their vehicle's status, even whether or not they're able to engage an enemy they're being attacked by.\n\n- A pretty interesting plot, narrated by Tom Baker no less. Nothing amazing, but the worldbuilding and the way the plot progression influences the gameplay is.. cool.\n\n- Simple arcade-vehicle gameplay but with a relatively deep strategy/tactics layer on top.\nYou can spend the entire mission just ordering your units around from the map and watch them do their work (Though the "RTS" view is not Real-time), or build a unit without a soul-chip (ie an AI pilot) to use for yourself. You can also take direct control of any vehicle piloted by your NPCs, which is another thing they'll comment on.\nYou have a lot of freedom to set your own objectives and tackle them in whichever order you see fit. Some mission-critical objectives require you to act pretty fast, but generally speaking you can go at your own pace.\nThe enemies will have their own production facilities meaning you're almost always either attacking, or defending your resource operations. Sometimes they go hand-in-hand. You can destroy their energy production which will (after the reserve power runs out or is destroyed) prevent their facilities producing vehicles, or go straight for the buildings themselves. You'll have to watch out for the million flak cannons that are in each mission though.\n\n\n- Diverse "cast" of vehicles, weapons and components; Shields, Armour, Cloaking, Long-range precision Lasers, Howitzers, Missile launchers, Helicopters, Hovercraft, Tanks. Each combination of weapon, vehicle and component(s) can be effective.\n\n- Likewise, lots of enemy stuff to destroy. They have Tanks, Self-propelled Guns, Mammoth tanks, Attack and Scout helicopters each based on real-world designs. There are emplaced AAA sites, howitzers, autocannon turrets and bunkers. Each poses a differing level of threat to each of your units. They're.. "upgraded" later in the game, and ultimately replaced by things much more sinister.\n\n- Simple in-game ordering system. Though the interface/controls for it are a bit archaic, after a few minutes using it it becomes muscle-memory. Order all your pilots to follow your vehicle and engage targets at will along the way, tell a specific unit to attack a specific target etc.\n\n- Resource system: Instead of a mine or forest you gotta tell your little people to chop down, there's only really one way to gather resources in this game: Blow ♥♥♥♥ up. The enemy vehicles and facilities you destroy will be turned to debris, which you must harvest either with a helicopter sling-loading it to your carrier, or by a dedicated Recycler unit, the Scarab. Some of the situations you'll find yourself in will prevent you from keeping a resource collector at a source Later in the game, you will gain access to a vehicle that can carry out both this and a combat role at the same time.\nMost missions will have areas full of pre-existing debris, or empty structures for you to harvest, but they will only net you so much energy before you have to move on to the next.\n\n\nCons:\n- The game has poor replayability. There's no facility for loading a specific mission after you've completed the game (Unless you save for each one - however there are only 9(?) save slots and more than 9 missions), there's no skirmish or multiplayer modes. That hasn't stopped me coming back and playing through it again every couple years. For the asking price now, that shouldn't be much of an issue because other than that, the game stands as it is.\nThat said, there are cheats that let you skip through missions and access the entire tech-tree in any mission, but I'd advise against using them your first play-through.\n\n- Slightly archaic control schemes - As I mentioned earlier, this mainly extends to the command interface - When you're not using the map, if you want to order a unit to do something, you press the appropriate number for that unit, and use W/A/S/D/Q/E to navigate the menu. The problem here is those are also the controls you use to move. This results in 1: the unit you're controlling stopping dead while you issue the order and 2: Possibly inadvertently issuing the wrong order because you were also using those buttons to move.\nIf you really need something done at that specific moment and the unit you're controlling is going to die if you rescind control for even a second, you're better off just going to the map screen and issuing orders from there since it pauses the game. Not a huge issue, but it's probably the most prevalent throughout the game. Otherwise, it's easy to get used to.\n\n- No difficulty levels. The game is sufficiently challenging, but there are a couple of missions, one too easy to the point of tedium and one that's pretty damn hard. Fortunately the latter one is later in the game, so hopefully you'll be prepared for it.\n\nNeutral:\n- This game doesn't hold your hand. The first three missions serve as a tutorial essentially, letting you get to grips with the resource collection, combat and ordering mechanics. Beyond that, the only direction and help you'll receive is from the mission briefings by Church and Walker - And what they say is almost always relelvant.\n\n- Mandatory stealth mission. Yeah, one of those. The mission fails if you're detected (Up til you've completed a particular objective), but as above, the guidance offered by your superiors will help you prevent it.\n\n- Little music. There are a few tracks, but they're reserved mainly for the main menu, the briefing and cutscenes with none during gameplay, bar one (short) mission.\n\n- Graphics are obviously dated, but still serviceable. Probably one of the better-looking games of its time.\n\n\n","April 5","true","18.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a hybrid of a simple arcadey vehicle simulator (both aerial and ground), and a real-time strategy. You are tasked with dealing with a bunch of comedically evil villains (like, they have a communist general, and a corrupt corporate executive, among their ranks, and they don't even bicker between one another because they're so concentrated on undermining the utopian society world has become) using one of the last operational carriers capable of creating units on it's own. And it's pretty fun, despite such an uncommon premise and games datedness it not only works fine on my machine, it also has a descent interface, which is lovely. Oh, and, you get to design vehicles on your own - not only do you designate what sort of vehicles you want built, you also get to pick the weapon, and the extra equipment like armor plating, or the "soulcatcher" module if you want to not only directly control the vehicles, but also give them orders. Finally, the RTS aspect also shows itself in the fact you require dedicated resource collector machines to convert scrap metal scattered after battles into resources, while enemies have oil rigs, which means that they have an advantage and you have to think fast and pick your targets before you get overcome.

История ставит вас в середине мира перестроен после войны, что почти уничтожил все. Люди этого нового мира вновь найти себя в конфликт, на этот раз против лидеров старого мира, которые бежали в подполье после поражения в войне.\n\nИстория довольно хорошо и сделает для интересного перезагрузки с современным дизайном. В качестве стратегии в реальном времени, это на самом деле довольно весело. Озвучкой приличный, и игра выглядит хорошо для выпуска 2001 года, но, безусловно, устарел сегодняшним стандартам. Игра использует 3D-карта, которая является хорошим изменением для RTS игр, выпущенных в то же самое время. Органы управления отличаются, чем я ожидал для РТС. Я обычно на микроуровне мои единиц, но с Враждебные воды: Антей Рост у вас нет этой способности. Есть множество различных блоков, которые можно создать, каждый со своими способностями и недостатками, в отличие от более известный названий, таких как игры командования и властвуй, в Антей Рост у вас есть возможность индивидуально обновления единиц с броней, щитами и т.д. ,\n\nВ целом, в то время как это может быть немного устаревшим, это приличный РТС и стоит поднимая если вы в старой школы стратегии в реальном времени игры. Лично я хотел бы, чтобы это в списке перезагрузки в какой-то момент в будущем.","December 13, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has some charm to it. Also, the sounds are good.\nThe tutorial is nice to immerse you into the system of the game, but you'll have to read it, otherwise you'll get yourself lost, not knowing what to do next.\nThe game has some pretty good story and background, also, it plays really well and you can choose if you want to play controlling the units or giving them instructions. When you have a small amount of units it may be easy to control one of them, but in a larger scale, it may be hard and best to give them instructions. But it gives that feeling of "you do what you really want".\nThe voice over is good, the energy collecting system also is pretty good and reminds me of Total Armageddon. It also can feel like a 3d version of TA, and, if you like this type of game, you'll have a good time.\nThe game is also pretty cheap, so, yeah, more reason for you to play.","January 2","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In 2006 I never actually finished the game. It was in 2014 when I finally picked this up and finished it.\n\nThis game is a blend of RTS and vehicle combat. You can either send your units to battle for you and control the action from a map or join your squad by controlling a single unit personally.\nThe beginning missions are quite easy but the game gets really tough at the end parts.\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone who's into Sci-fi RTS hybrids.\nThis is one of my favourite games of all time.\n\nGet this game while its on sale tho since I don't see why a half forgotten game from 2001 is 10 dollars.( Yes , My steam is in dollars even if i'm in Europe )\n","September 24, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
